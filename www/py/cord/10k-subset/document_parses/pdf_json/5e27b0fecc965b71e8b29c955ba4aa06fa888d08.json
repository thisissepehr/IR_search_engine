Material and methods: Study population: children >6 months of age with culture positive pyelonephritis admitted to 11 Paediatric Departments, from October 2014 through December 2015. Septic children and those with known urological anomalies were excluded. The patients were treated 10 days with oral antibiotics (amoxicillinclavulanate or piv-mecillinam). Our protocol included a nurse telephone consultation with the family on day 2 of treatment, and a clinical reexamination of the patient on day 3. The patients all underwent renal ultrasound and in some centers a renal scintigraphy. Results: 446 children, 388 (87%) females, median age 27.2 months (range 0.6-16.3 years), 361 (81%) of the population had their first episode of pyelonephritis. Urine was obtained by suprapubic puncture in 52 (26% of those <2 years), by clean catch urine in 384 (71% had 2 cultures done) and by clean catheterization in 10 girls. Escherichia coli were identified in 410 (92%) patients. The vast majority of patients, 407 (91%) were effectively treated by oral antibiotics, while 39 (9%) were switched to parental antibiotics, causes listed were: lack of clinical improvement (n = 18), vomiting (n = 7), resistance to antibiotics (n = 7) or other problems (n = 7). Renal ultrasound was abnormal in 7% (30/433), and renal scintigraphy was abnormal in 13% (36/283). Data analysis comparing \"failure of oral antibiotic treatment\" with those who succeeded revealed no significant predictor of treatment failure with oral antibiotics: age (p = 0.826), C-reactive protein (p = 0.064), frequency of girls (p = 0.814), Escherichia coli (p = 0.776), first pyelonephritis (p = 0.929), abnormal ultrasound or abnormal scintigraphy (p = 0.599, p = 0.918), respectively. Conclusions: Treatment of pyelonephritis with oral piv-mecillinam or amoxicillin-clavulanate at home is safe and effective, but formalized contact to the Paediatric Departments is required as 9% of patients need a shift to intravenous antibiotic treatment.",

Most papers suggest that fetal MRI is a valuable adjunct or complementatry tool to ultrasound imaging. This is the first known research study from the UK and the only five years duration retrospective review in literature assessing the impact of fetal MRI on antenatally suspected renal anomalies. Material and methods: This retrospective review was based at the Fetal MRI Department at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, part of the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This study included all referrals for fetal MRI from October 2011 to September 2015. Of the 578 referrals identified, 80 were due to renal concerns. The results of the antenatal USG imaging and fetal MRI were compared with that of the postnatal USG imaging which was considered to be the gold standard in this study. Results: Out of the eighty referrals, there were four terminations, three stillbirths, nine neonatal deaths and of the rest of the 64 referrals, outcome data was available for 27 pregnancies. Comparable results between antenatal USG imaging and fetal MRI was found in 26% of the pregnancies. Fetal MRI changed the diagnoses in 31.25% and in another 42.5% provided additional information. In 12.5%, the additional information provided could potentailly have impacted on the outcome of these pregnancies and of these, 90% of the additional information were about non-renal related systems. The positive predicitive value for fetal MRI was 88.9% as compared to 74% for antenatal USG imaging. Conclusions: Fetal MRI has therefore made an impact on 44% of the pregnancies that underwent fetal MRI due to renal concerns in the antenatal ultrasound imaging.",

            "text": "Introduction: Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of recurrent pyelonephritis in children with vesicouretral reflux (VUR). However, there is an ongoing debate on which children should be Pediatr Nephrol (2017) 32:1643-1834 screened for VUR after a first episode of pyelonephritis. More concrete, the value of renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS) in diagnosing VUR has been challenged. In this abstract, we present our preliminary findings of a database study in children younger than 4 years of age. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of patients younger than 4 years who were followed-up at our department, after a first episode of pyelonephritis, between 2009 and 2015. Patients were included if clinical information concerning index pyelonephritis, and paired RBUS and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) were available. Patients were excluded if a VCUG had been performed preceding index pyelonephritis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used for examining risk factors for VUR, SPSS version 22 was used for performing all analyses. Results: Data of 399 children were available for analysis. Escherichia coli was cultured in 345 cases (86.4%). Hydroureters and duplex ureters were found in 25 renal units (3.1%), any grade of VUR in 179 units (22.4%), dilating VUR in 74 units (9.2%). In our first logistic regression analysis, girls, index infections with non-E. coli pathogens, and duplex ureters were risk factors for any grade of VUR. In general, ultrasound parameters were not significantly predictive for VUR. In VUR cases that were missed by RBUS (124), bladder was empty at RBUS in 76 children (73.1%). Conclusions: Girls, and children suffering pyelonephritis by non-E.coli uropathogens are at risk for VUR in children less than 4 years. RBUS is of limited value in diagnosing VUR.",

Those with ESRD on haemodialysis (HD) have an over tenfold increase burden of cardiovascular comorbidity and mortality when compared to contemporaries, significantly reducing their life expectancy. This contrasts with a fourfold increase when compared to older patients and their contemporaries. All YAs on our St George's renal database were surveyed (Have your say!) in 2014, to ascertain changes they would like to see in the renal unit to improve their patient experience. Peer support opportunities featured in over 70% of responses. Additionally, an adherence assessment of our YAs showed 100% of the YAs on HD had adherence issues. We therefore elected to assess whether providing peer support opportunities could improve haemodialysis outcomes for this patient group. Material and methods: We targeted our YAs (18-25 years) on haemodialysis population and offered them the opportunity of forming a cohort on the Monday, Wednesday & Friday twilight shift 5.30(6.00) pm to 9.30(10.00) pm, as a preparatory survey identified later dialysis away from the weekend to be the preferable option for the majority of the YAs. Six of our young adults demonstrating low adherence were cohorted and followed up in our Young Adult Clinic. Results: Attendance and completion of dialysis sessions significantly improved in this cohort. There has also been a reduction in hospital admissions and length of stay among our young adults as well as reduced intra-dialysis weight gain. The Young Adults at St George's hospital are consistently achieving Urea Reduction Ratios (URR) above the Renal Association (RA) Guidelines 65%. URR scores have increased steadily across the young adult cohort population between 2015 and 2017 similarly to Haemoglobin levels. Bone health however has remained suboptimal over this period.

Material and methods: We studied non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors of inflammatory (IL-6, hsCRP, pentraxin-3, LP-PLA2), antiinflammatory (IL-10), oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine), anti-oxidant capacity [Total antioxidant capacity (TAC)] and endothelial (ADMA, SDMA, oxidized LDL) markers in 22 children (13 female, aged between 8.9-15) on HD and HDF in two tertiary dialysis units in London and Istanbul. All children received HD for at least 3 months, and then switched to HDF. Results: None of the measures, except IL-10 levels, correlated with time on dialysis, suggesting that even a short dialysis vintage of 3 months on HD increases inflammatory and endothelial markers. After 3-months of switching to HDF there was a significant improvement in Beta2 microglobulin (B2m), IL-10, hsCRP, ADMA, SDMA, AGE, ox-LDL and TAC (Table-1 ). HDF was associated with a significant reduction in ADMA, SDMA, hs-CRP and AGE even in children with a urine output >200 ml compared to those with <200 ml urine per day. The clearance of these markers was not associated with the type of vascular access, but children with a lower blood flow rate had higher inflammatory status (higher IL-6/ IL-10 ratio; p = 0.045, r = \u22120.431). Children with a higher convective volume (higher than median 12.8 L/m2) had lower Ox-LDL (p = 0.024), compared to those who achieved a lower convective volume. The TAC in HDF was comparable to levels in a cohort of CKD2 patients (p = 0.08) but other endothelial markers (ADMA, SDMA, ox-LDL) were significantly higher on HDF than CKD2 (p < 0.01 for all). Introduction: Boys affected by PUV may develop bladder dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate bladder status at 10 years of age. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed non-invasive urodynamics performed at ten years in PUV patients.

Patients divided in group 1 -large BC (>150%EBC), group 2 -normal BC and group 3 -small BC (<65% EBC) as per ICCS criteria. Incomplete bladder emptying was considered when >10% of BC. Results: We identified 84 boys born 1997-2006; we excluded those who had bladder augmentation (n = 7), renal transplant (n = 12) or had unavailable information (n = 11). Fifty-four patients were analysed (outcomes shown in table). Three patients practised CIC (two in group 1, one in group 3). Two had recurrent UTIs (one in group 1 with abnormal PVR; one in group 3, normal PVR). Seven patients (13%) demonstrated normal uroflow assessment. See Table. 1.",

LIFR encodes a transmembrane receptor utilized by IL-6 family cytokines, mainly by the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Mutational analysis of 121 further patients with severe CAKUT yielded two rare heterozygous LIFR missense variants predicted to be pathogenic in three unrelated patients. LIFR mutants showed decreased half-life and cell membrane localization resulting in reduced LIF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation. LIFR showed high expression in human fetal kidney and the human ureter, and was also expressed in the developing murine urogenital system. Lifr knockout mice displayed urinary tract malformations including hydronephrosis, hydroureter, ureter ectopia, and, consistently, reduced ureteral lumen and muscular hypertrophy, similar to the phenotypes observed in patients carrying LIFR variants. Additionally, a form of cryptorchidism was detected in all Lifr \u2212/\u2212 mice and the patient carrying the LIFR frameshift mutation. Conclusions: We demonstrate heterozygous novel or rare LIFR mutations in 3.3% of CAKUT patients, and provide evidence that Lifr deficiency and deactivating LIFR mutations cause highly similar anomalies of the urogenital tract in mice and humans.",

Introduction: B cell depletion is a recognized treatment of steroid dependant(SDNS) and steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome(SRNS). Interleukine-6(IL-6) is an attractive target as it promotes B-cell differenciation into antibody-forming plasma cells. We report a pilot series of SRNS and SDNS patients treated with tocilizumab(TCZ), a monoclonal anti IL6-receptor antibody, with Intraveinous Immunoglobulins(IVIg). Material and methods: 17 patients received an initial treatment combining IVIg(2 g/kg) at day 0 and 30 and TCZ(8 mg/kg, or 12 mg/kg if weight < 35 kg) at day 15 and 45 followed by TCZ once a month in patients in complete remission(A) or twice a month if proteinuria persisted(B). Anticalcineurin inhibitors were discontinued 3 months after remission. Treatment objective was a sustained remission after anticalcineurin inhibitors withdrawal and/or after end of the protocol. Results: Five SDNS and 12 SRNS were included. Among SRNS, five had tacrolimus-dependant remission and 7 multidrug resistance. All patients but the two youngest had previously received rituximab. Eight patients received schedule (A): tacrolimus was successfully discontinued in 4/6 patients initially under tacrolimus. Sustained remission was observed in three patients, with a follow up after M6 TCZ of 15 months, 2 and 1 months. Nine patients received schedule (B): remission of proteinuria was obtained in 4/9 patients in association with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus was successfully discontinued in one patient. Three patients are still under TCZ and tacrolimus for longer than 6 months. Immunophenotyping showed no reduction in memory B cell subsets while under TCZ. Reversible leuconeutropenia occurred in 2/17 patients. Conclusions: Targeting IL-6 has been modestly efficient in this small pilot series. Effect of IL-6 inhibition on B cells subsets is inconclusive but most patients had received rituximab in the previous months. Longer follow-up is required to assess if it is a valuable treatment option to be discussed in severe NS or as an alternative to B cell depletion.",

Background: Transition is defined as the purposeful, planned movement of adolescents from child-centred to adult-orientated healthcare systems. Despite the importance of good transition being recognised, delivery is often fragmented, with many young people (YP) feeling unprepared. This failure has a major impact on long-term outcomes. Interpretation of the definition of transition by many Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and misconceptions about implementation have delayed the provision of effective transition. An educational package expanding on the definition of transition to include 'empowering the YP by equipping them with the skills and knowledge necessary to manage their own healthcare in paediatric and adult services' and provision of the RSG programme helps enable delivery of transition.",

Introduction: Simulation-based education is considered one of the best training strategies to enhance the performance of healthcare professionals. Simulation is used intensively now for the training purpose and for the assessment of residents performance. Interprofessional education is the strategy used to boost the collaborative practice among multidisciplinary team for the best quality of care. Using different types of simulation-based education in pediatric nephrology field is limited in the research body. We conducted multiple simulation sessions to improve the training in the acute pediatric nephrology among the residents.The individual and inter-professional performances of the residents in all the simulation scenarios were objectively assessed. Material and methods: Three acute pediatric nephrology simulation scenarios were conducted over different days to evaluate the residents' performance. The participants included residents, faculties in pediatric nephrology, faculties in different specialties, nurse and some allied health professionals. All the participants were working together in each scenario as a multidisciplinary team while the target population was the residents of different levels. The scenarios were designed by an expert in pediatric nephrology and simulation as well. The learning outcome is measured by two different tools. The first was a post sessions survey (self-assessment). The second tool was direct observation by high quality performance check list (Expert assessment). The simulation station was 15 min followed by 30 min debriefing. The stations were; acute kidney injury secondary to renal hypoperfusion, renal failure with critical hyperkalemia and neonatal hyperammonemia required CRRT. Student t-test was used to evaluate the quantitative portion of the data expressed by the Likert scale of the post simulation surveys. Manual coding by three independent researchers was done to evaluate the text portion of the questionnaire. Results: The result showed a significant learning outcome from the simulation sessions. The residents were quite interested in the simulation learning compared to the traditional lectures in the same topics. The hands-on practice and rapid effective actions were observed in all of the simulation scenarios. Most of the residents worked collaboratively and effectively within the multidisciplinary team.",

Introduction: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children is a rare but serious health problem, which occurs in about 5 to 10 children per million each year, globally. Scottish Renal Registry (SRR) reports that the incidence of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients <20 years of age in Scotland in 2015 is 1.2 per 100.000 population. The major cause of mortality in children with ESRD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data on long-term survival and CVD incidence among children with ESRD are sparse. Available studies are short-term, are based on single centre experience and include only selected RRT population (either on dialysis, or after transplantation, or patients in specific age groups). Therefore, we aimed to describe the long-term survival and CVD incidence in patients initiating RRT in childhood in Scotland.",

We identified incident CVD through linkage to causes of death and hospital admission records. CVD incidence was defined as the first CV event, either CV death or CV hospital admission, whichever came first. Since causes of death and hospital admission data is available in Scotland from 1981 we included patients who started RRT between 1981 and 2013 to describe CVD incidence (CVD incidence cohort). We used Cox regression analysis to describe associations between primary renal disease (PRD), type of RRT, age at start of RRT and sex and all-cause mortality or CVD incidence. PRD were divided into three categories: congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), glomerulonephritis and \"other\" (cystic kidney disease, hereditary nephropathy, ischemic renal failure, vasculitis and metabolic disorders). In the all-cause mortality analyses we included patients from the start of RRT until date of death or 31st December 2015, whichever came first. In the CVD incidence analysis we included patients from start of RRT until CVD event or 31st December 2015, whichever came first. Results: Characteristics of the mortality cohort (N = 479) and the CVD incidence cohort (N = 381) were similar. There were more males (57.2%) than females, the largest group of PRD was CAKUT (48.6%) and the majority of patients initiated their treatment with dialysis (87.9%). In the mortality cohort 126 patients died during a median follow-up of 18.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 8.7-27.0). The long-term survival was 86% (95% CI 82.9-89.1) at 10 years and 76% (95% CI 72.2-79.8) at 20 years. In the CVD cohort 134 patients developed CVD incidence during a median follow-up of 12.9 years (IQR 5.6-21.5). The overall crude mortality and CVD incidence rates were 1.5 and 2.6 per 100 person-years, respectively. Patients with an 'other' category of PRD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to patients with CAKUT. Receiving dialysis rather than a kidney transplantation during follow-up was associated with a higher risk of both all-cause mortality and CVD incidence. Younger age at initiation of RRT was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality, while the reverse was found with respect to CVD incidence. Conclusions: Type of RRT and age at start of RRT were significant determinants for both all-cause mortality and CVD incidence, while PRD was significantly associated only with all-cause mortality.",

We hypothesised that a single low dose of 375 mg/m 2 would be noninferior to higher or multiple doses in reducing the frequency of disease relapse and time to B-cell reconstitution. Material and methods: This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational cohort study of children with a diagnosis of steroid sensitive frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Data were extracted from clinical records on the dates of diagnosis, treatment and relapses; the use of concomitant immunosuppression; and lymphocyte subset profiling pre-and post-rituximab administration. The primary outcome was an absence of clinically confirmed relapse 12 months following Rituximab administration. Secondary outcomes were median time to relapse, probability of being relapse free at 6 and 24 months, time to reconstitution of CD19 + B cells and the introduction of additional or ongoing immunosuppression. Results: 60 patients received 143 courses of Rituximab. Patients in group 1 received a higher total dose of 1.5 g/m 2 , group 2 received an intermediate dose between 750 mg/m 2 -1 g/m 2 and group 3 (103 courses) received our current low dose regimen of a single dose of 375 mg/m 2 . There was no difference in event-free survival at 6, 12, or 24 months between groups. Of those who relapsed, the median time to relapse was 317 days in group one and 299 days in group three. The median time to reconstitution of B-cells was not significantly different between groups at 175, 226 and 196 days for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Conclusions: We conclude that usage of a single low dosage regimen of Rituximab in the management of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome does not affect the time to B-cell reconstitution or the probability of relapse at 6 and 12 months in our cohort of patients.",

Partial responsiveness to calcineurin inhibition (CNI) has anecdotally been reported. Here we explored changes in albuminemia during RAAS blockade with and without intensified immunosuppression (IIS) in a cohort of children with NPHS2 glomerulopathy. Material and methods: We performed a longitudinal PodoNet registry analysis of 40 children with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) caused by NPHS2 mutation and documented periods of RAAS antagonist therapy with and without co-treatment with intensified immunosuppression (IIS; 79% CNI) administered before the genetic diagnosis was made. Serum albumin and estimated (e)GFR were assessed before IIS and/or RAAS blockade, during combined RAAS/IIS treatment and during RAAS blockade after IIS discontinuation. Results: RAAS blockade was started shortly after first disease manifestation (median 2.4 (IQR 0.9-6) months). In 16 patients RAAS antagonists were initiated simultaneously with IIS, whereas in 24 patients RAAS antagonists were added after an average IIS treatment duration of 2.8 (1.2-5.3) months. Combined IIS/RAAS blockade did not change serum albumin significantly (mean 19.7 \u00b1 6.2 -> 20.2 \u00b1 5.6 g/l; p = 0.19). Within 12 months after IIS discontinuation but continued RAAS blockade serum albumin increased slightly to a mean of 21.6 \u00b1 6.2 g/l (p = 0.02). eGFR decreased by 7 ml/min*1.73m 2 during this period. During subsequent follow-up under continued RAAS blockade (total duration 4.0 (IQR 2.8-5.6) years) serum albumin increased further to a mean of 22.5 \u00b1 5.8 g/l (p = 0.06), paralleled by a median eGFR loss by 18 (6-36) ml/min per year. The changes in serum albumin and eGFR were weakly correlated (r = \u22120.14).",

TMA rate, change in renal function and targeted serious adverse events (TSAE: serious infections, meningococcal infection, sepsis, leukopenia, infusion reactions, renal or hepatic impairment and malignancy) were assessed. Results: Thirty-nine patients with a median age of 8.0 years (range 0.0-17.0) at first eculizumab infusion were enrolled in the study. No ontreatment data was collected from four patients who stopped treatment prior to this study. In the primary studies, median time between aHUS diagnosis and first eculizumab dose was 3.1 (range 0.0-191.4) months. Median follow-up duration in this study was 40.6 (range 3.1-84.7) months.

Mutations in CFH, resulting in aHUS, predominantly reside in the C-terminus, resulting in impaired surface binding. CFH, along with five highly homologous CFH related genes (CFHR1-5), is located within the Regulators of Complement Activation cluster. Due to the high degree of sequence homology, this region is prone to genomic rearrangement resulting in hybrid genes (CFH::CFHR1 and CFHR1::CFH). CFH::CFHR1 hybrids result in the exchange of the C-terminus of CFH with the C-terminus of CFHR1 (impairing surface binding), whilst CFHR1::CFH hybrids lead to replacement of the C-terminus of CFHR1 with the C-terminus of CFH (impairing complement regulation). Material and methods: All patients referred to the UK's National aHUS centre with a diagnosis of aHUS (n = 984) underwent Sanger sequencing of CFH to identify point mutations, and multi-ligation probe amplification (MLPA) to identify genomic rearrangement. Genomic rearrangement events generating CFH::CFHR1 hybrid were identified due to loss of CFH Ex.22/23 and gain of the corresponding region of CFHR1, Ex.5/6. CFHR1::CFH hybrids were identified due to loss of CFHR1 Ex.5/6 and gain of CFH Ex.22/23. Results: Sanger sequencing identified 86 patients with pathogenic variants in CFH. Analysis of the MLPA data revealed an additional 40 patients with either CFH::CFHR1 or CFHR1::CFH hybrids.",

            "text": "Results: Of the 132 included patients, 51 (38.6%) were found to have at least one manifestation of systemic oxalosis. Bone disorders represented the most frequent manifestation (18.9% (25/132) at diagnosis and cumulatively 30.3% (40/132) at follow up), followed by cardiac (3.8%, 15 .2%), cutaneous-and vascular (3.8%, 15 .4%), ophthalmologic (7.6%, 12.9%), neurological (4.5%, 8.3%) amongst other manifestations. We found 31 different combinations of symptoms. The majority of manifestations (94%, 48/51) were found in patients with an eGFR <15 ml/min/ 1.73 m2. PH patients were not routinely screened; e.g. 26.5% had not undergone any ophthalmologic evaluation. We report the first patient with manifestations of oxalosis, an eGFR above 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 and plasma oxalate level below 30 \u03bcmol/l. Conclusions: This study highlights the heterogeneity of systemic oxalosis. The high number of reported systemic manifestations of oxalosis might be an underestimate due to the large number of nonsystematically screened asymptomatic patients. Evidence of systemic oxalosis in a patient with moderate CKD warrants attention. Our results challenge the current assumption that systemic deposition of oxalate starts when the plasma oxalate level is >30 \u03bcmol/l and the eGFR <40 ml/min/ 1.73 m2. Therefore, we stress the value of annual screening for systemic oxalosis in PH1 patients with CKD2+.",

            "text": "Introduction: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary periodic fever syndrome, affecting the populations surrounding Mediterranean region. Mainly it is mostly seen in Turks, Armenians, Arabs and Sephardic Jews. It is an autoinflammatory disease, which is inherited OR with recurrent abdominal pain, peritonitis, which can be watched with arthritis and skin lesions, lasting in 6-72 h, characterized by amyloidosis in time. Disease responsible gene locus is located on chromosome 16 and is called the short arm MEFV. Colchicine is the standard treatment to prevent attacks and amyloidosis, which is a serious complication of the disease.Fabry Disease (FD) has X linked transition and is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids in various tissues and organs, caused by the mutation in the GLA gene and alpha-galactosidase A enzyme deficiency. The enzyme activity should be checked when the disease is suspected clinically.Ten years of time between diagnosis and the onset of symptoms in these patients is due to the presence of organ damage and systemic symptoms which can be confused with systemic diseases. Therefore if there is an ethnicity with in FD patients which have these symptoms, mistakenly placed diagnosis of FMF and the FD does not mind too often. Because it can be prevented, it is important to initiate early treatment. This study was aimed to create awareness for the FD. Material and methods: One hundred patients which are diagnosed FMF according to Tell-Hashomer criterias and have MEFV gene analysis at Celal Bayar University Hospital Pediatric Nephrology Department are included in this study. Gal A activity analysis Measurement of enzyme activity in dried blood spot samples was performed via DBS method using filter paper containing DBS as a source of DNA. Blood samples were collected before dialysis in hemodialysis patients and at any time in peritoneal dialysis patients. Four drops of the blood were transferred to a filter paper, allowed to dry at room temperature, and kept at 2-4\u00b0C until analysis. The enzyme activities were calculated in \u03bcmol/L/h or pmol/spot*20 h. Patients with values <1.2 \u03bcmol/l/h or <200 pmol/spot*20 h were considered to have low \u03b1-Gal A activity. GLA mutation on genetic analysis In patients with low \u03b1-Gal A activity, screening of the GLA mutation was performed using DBS cards based on Sanger sequence analysis. This assay uses PCR amplification followed by Sanger DNA sequencing to detect mutations in the GLA gene that cause Fabry disease. The gene encoding GLA is found on Xq22, and spans 13 kb of genomic DNA (7 exons, cDNA of 1290 bases). The GLA gene encodes a 429 amino acid protein, of which the first 31 residues form a lysosomal signal peptide. Classical phenotypes are typically caused by misssense, nonsense, severe splicing mutations and large gene defects. Variant phenotypes are typically caused by splicing defects that express residual enzyme activity. The coding sequences and flanking intronic sequences (minimum of 20 base pairs) of exons 1-7 of the GLA gene are amplified from purified genomic DNA and sequenced in the forward and reverse directions. Sequencing of a single exon is available for targeted mutation analysis. Patient sequences are compared to the reference DNA sequence (GenBank Accession: X14448, NM_000169.1). Results: Thirty-five percent of the patients in this study were male and 65% female. Male / female ratio was 1 / 1.8 was found. The mean age of onset of symptoms is 5.89 \u00b1 3.35. FMF diagnosed family member was found in %59 of patients. The most common symptoms of patients with initial symptoms include fever (89%) and abdominal pain (94%). Then follows arthralgia (51%), arthritis (20%), chest pain (30%), erysipelas (9%). When the M694 V is the most common allele frequency rate of 40.5% and respectively others are E148Q 11%, V726A 7%, M680 5.5%, R202Q 5%, R761H 4.5% found. The most common genotypes are respectively M694 V homozygotes, E148Q heterozygotes and M694 V heterozygotes. The main symptoms that are common with other gastrointestinal symptoms of Fabry patients which are encountered during the course of the disease are nausea %28, diarrhea %13 and constipation %15. Incidence of neurological symptoms are headache 32%, akroparesthesis 23% and tinnitus 16%. Alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity in 2 male patients from the study group were significantly lower but in the GLA gene analysis it wasn't found a mutation that belong to FD.",

Introduction: This study evaluated the efficacy of cinacalcet for reducing plasma intact parathyroid hormone(iPTH), the impact on albumincorrected Ca(cCa) and phosphorus(P); safety and tolerability of cinacalcet. Material and methods: Eligible subjects (6to < 18 years) on chronic dialysis \u2265 2 months, with PTH > 300 pg/mL, Ca \u2265 8.8 mg/dL and P \u2265 4.0 mg/dL (6to < 12 years) or \u22653.5 mg/dL (12to < 18 years) were randomized 1:1 to cinacalcet or placebo stratified by age group (<12and \u2265 12 years). Cinacalcet was started at \u22640.20 mg/kg/day and titrated (max 4.2 mg/kg/day) once every 4 weeks over 24 weeks followed by a 6-week efficacy assessment phase (EAP). Plasma iPTH, serum cCa, and P were collected bi-weekly during titration and EAP. Results: 43/100 planned subjects were enrolled and received \u22651 dose of investigational product (22 cinacalcet; 21 placebo). The study was terminated early after consultation with regulatory authorities following a fatality in a subject with severe hypocalcemia receiving cinacalcet. The cause of death was determined to be multifactorial, but a causal role for hypocalcemia could not be excluded. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced. 54.5%(12/22) cinacalcet and 19.0%(4/21) placebo subjects achieved \u226530% reduction from baseline in mean PTH during the EAP (study primary endpoint), with a difference of 35.5%(95%CI: 8.76%, 62.24%), based on last observation carried forward imputation (CMH test p = 0.017). Numerically reduced cCa and similar P were observed in subjects who received cinacalcet.

There was difference between AKI and non-AKI in age; mean \u00b1 SD 38.1 \u00b1 39.5 vs55.5 \u00b1 58.0 (p value 0.29). Post cardiac surgery renal insult was the main cause of AKI (27.3%). There was 2-fold increased risk of incident AKI in those patients with high baseline uNGAL at PICU admission and almost 4-fold increased risk in patients with high baseline cystatin-C at PICU admission. uNGAL levels were highly predictive of AKI during the follow-up period, Area Under the Curve(AUC 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61-0.92) The cutoff point with the highest correctly classified proportion was 223 ng/ml (\u2265 12 centiles) which correctly predict 80.0% patients with AKI, with a corresponding sensitivity of 72.7% and a specificity of 89.9%. AUC for serum cystatin-C was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75-0.97), and the highest correctly classified proportion was 1009 ugL (\u2265 13 centiles); 75% of patients with AKI, with a corresponding sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 88.9%. Conclusions: uNGAL and serum cystatin-C predicts AKI early in critically ill children. Introduction: To analyse the need for dialysis in paediatric patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) and kidney transplant (KTx) who received eculizumab either pre-or post-transplantation.

However, reliability of currently used assays to detect C3NeF is limited. Recently, we developed a method to measure convertase stability in whole human serum and we now optimized the method for simple detection of convertase-stabilizing factors such as C3NeF in large patient cohorts. Material and methods: Convertase stability was measured in a hemolytic assay using the C5-blocking agent eculizumab to separate the alternative pathway (AP) into two steps: formation of C3/ C5 convertases by test sera in step 1 (a time-variable step) and formation of lytic membrane attack complexes in a standardized second step for readout. Samples of 15 controls, 33 patients with (suspected) C3G or closely related disorders, and family members with Factor B (FB) mutation (p.Lys323Glu) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) were analyzed.",

Its long-term prognosis depends on renal involvement. The management of Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) remains controversial. This study reports the prognosis of children with HSPN presenting with class 2 ISKDC nephritis. Material and methods: All children with HSPN Class 2 diagnosed between 1995 and 2015 in four pediatric nephrology centers were included and clinical and biological data were collected from the medical files. The primary endpoint was the remission of proteinuria defined as a proteinuria <200 mg/L. Results: Ninety-two children were included with a median follow-up time of 36 months. Twenty-eight percent had nephrotic syndrome, 31% proteinuria > 3 g/L, 52% proteinuria between 1 and 3 g/L and 18% proteinuria <1 g/L. Forty-seven percent received treatment with oral steroids alone, 37% received methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral steroids, 18% have not been treated with steroids. Eighty-five percent reached remission during follow-up but 12% of them did not maintain complete remission over time so that only 75% remained in complete remission by the end of the follow-up. Univariate analysis found a linear increase of the likelihood of remission with initial proteinuria (p = 0.009). This trend was not found in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for treatments as patients with higher proteinuria were most often treated with steroids.",

Introduction: Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by cystine accumulation and early renal damage. Strict compliance to the cystine depleting agent cysteamine is necessary for more efficient treatment. Leucocyte cystine is the current therapeutic monitor. Although highly specific, its use is hindered by many technical difficulties and its availability in only few laboratories all over the world. Recent evidence suggests that inflammatory cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of cystinosis and its rapid progression to ESRD. Macrophage activation markers, such as chitotriosidase and several cytokines have been linked to disease severity and response to cysteamine therapy in cross-sectional studies. We aim to assess the longitudinal clinical value of these markers as potential therapeutic monitors in a large cohort of cystinosis patients. Material and methods: Fifty four patients (19 children and 35 adults) were recruited from the cystinosis clinics in Leuven (Belgium), Nijmegen (Netherlands) and Traunstein (Germany). Patients were followed-up for two years during which, clinical and laboratory data were regularly collected from hospital records. Every three months, plasma samples were obtained to analyze macrophage activation markers including chitotriosidase. These markers were correlated with leucocyte cystine concentration and with other parameters of renal disease such as, serum creatinine and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Results: Cystinosis patients showed large variation in compliance/response to cysteamine therapy. Average leucocyte cystine concentrations during the previous two years ranged from 0.65 to 5.8 nmol \u00bd cystine/mg protein.",

Potential predictive factors for CKD including oliguria, gross hematuria, nephrotic proteinuria, hypertension, baseline eGFR <60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 , dialysis at onset, duration before treatment, type of immune deposits, and histological class were evaluated using Cox regression. Results: At onset, gender, age, oliguria, gross hematuria and duration before treatment were similar among classes. Nephrotic proteinuria, hypertension, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and dialysis requirement were less common in focal than other classes (p < 0.05). Type of immune deposits was different among classes (p = 0.001). Focal and mixed classes were observed in patients with immune-complex deposits but not in those with pauci-immune or anti-GBM deposits. Over 629 patient-years of follow-up, CKD occurred in 24 patients (33%). The overall probability of CKD at 1, 5 and 10 years were 25%, 32% and 34%, respectively and differed among classes ( Figure) . The only factor independently predicting CKD was sclerotic class (hazard ratio 16.70 vs.mixed class; 95% CI 3.33-83.70, p = 0.001). There was a trend towards higher probability of CKD in crescentic vs. mixed class (hazard ratio 3.24; 95% CI 1.97-10.87, p = 0.06).",

Introduction: Background: Diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (D + HUS) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Case fatalities are often associated with severe neurological involvement in children and advanced age in adults but currently specific treatment is unavailable. Plasma exchange has been usedinthe deterioratingpatient with D +HUS but the efficacy remains uncertain. Plasma exchange could theoretically enable removal of Shigatoxins, pro-inflammatory cytokines and prothrombotic factors thereby limiting disease progression. Aim: To assess the efficacy of plasma exchange in D + HUS based on a review of the literature. Material and methods: Methods: We searched the databases Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and LiLACS for reports describing the outcome of plasma exchange in D + HUS.We also selected additional references through bibliographies from identified articles. We restricted the search to articles in English and French to report published after 1990. The decision to exclude reports before 1990 was made in light of difficulties assessing full-text articles which often could not be located online. Results: We included 16 reports describing outcomes of plasma exchange in patients (children and adults) with D + HUS. Reports ranged from case reports to cohort studies and one case control study with the largest study population emanating from the 2011 German D + HUS outbreak. Outcomes seemed to consistently point to efficacy of early plasma exchange in reducing case fatality rates in patients >60 years. In addition, limited evidence points to efficacy of plasma exchange in improving outcome in children with D + HUS.",

Results: Thirteen cases (52%) had normal ADAMTS13 levels and in 12 cases (48%) it was mildly (8 cases, 67%) to moderately (4 cases, 33%) deficient. ADAMTS13 inhibitors were negative in 11 of those 12 cases. One showed borderline positivity. Eight (32%) had associated neurological affection, seven of whom had a normal CT brain scan, and one showed mild brain atrophy. Seven of the 12 ADAMTS13 deficient patients (58.3%) had neurological symptoms, vs. only one of the ADAMTS13 normal ones (p = 0.011). There was a negative correlation between the ADAMTS13 activity and neurological affection (\u22120.511, p 0.009). Fourteen patients recovered completely, 6 had persistent renal damage or hypertension, 4 died and 1 had a relapse (a D -ve case). Recovery showed a higher incidence among the D + ve cases ( Introduction: Clinical manifestation, genetic background, and follow-up studies of pediatric patients with complement-dysregulation hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in Taiwan are not well studied. Material and methods: Nine pediatric patients with aHUS belonging to nine unrelated Taiwanese families were enrolled. Genomic DNA was analyzed for CFH, CFI and MCP genes by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The clinical presentations, and laboratory data including serum CFH/I on the first presentation and follow-up outcome were recorded. Results: The age at onset of nine patients ranged from 2 days to 11 years with male predominant. All patients did not family history of HUS, and one patient had co-existing underlying disease. At presentation, all had hypertension with oliguira, and two of them had bloody diarrhea. Central nervous system and heart were the most common extra-renal involved organs. Infectious triggers were identified in 5 patients, and the time from trigger to presentation ranged from 2 to 10 days. All but one had anemia and thrombocytopenia. All has elevated LDH, which ranged from 468 to 3163 IU/L, and Half of patients had normal C3 and C4 levels. Introduction: We report the rare case of a 2 years old girl who was diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), caused by DGKE (diacyl-glycerol-kinase-kappa). At the time of admission, she showed nephroso-nephritic symptoms, paleness with mild jaundice. Material and methods: Laboratory results showed anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased LDH, Coombs negative hemolysis, and maintained kidney function. Urine analysis showed nephrotic range proteinuria and mild haematuria. Because of the nephroso-nephritic symptoms kidney biopsy was done, the result was secondary thrombotic microangiopathy. Immunologic study proved no abnormalities of alternative Complement route, complement C3 was in normal range, ADAMTS 13 activity was decreased, but not in the range as we see it in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Results: After no improvement to parenteral high dose pulse steroid treatment and plasmapheresis, we started eculizumab treatment without any improvement in the patient condition or the laboratory result.",

Infectious complications were recorded on 54 occasions (peritonitis n = 33, bacteraemia on HD n = 21, 0.8 per patient/year). Peritonitis resulted in change of catheter in 6/33 (18%), causes included no organism identified (n = 12) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (n = 7). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of HD bacteraemia (n = 9). Haemodialysis lines were replaced on 21 occasions, the most common reasons was being dislodged (n = 12) or infection (n = 6). Alteplase for blocked or poorly flowing lines was used on 13 occasions and was successful on 11 occasions. Conclusions: In our contemporary study, only a minority of infected dialysis lines resulted in replacement. Interestingly, over 50% of HD line changes were due to accidental displacement. These baseline data will form the basis of future quality improvement projects to minimise preventable loss of dialysis access in children. Introduction: Determination of renal function in neonates can be challenging. Firstly, it is difficult to obtain timed urine samples, and blood sampling requires skills. Secondly, the renal function of normal infants is known to change considerably during the 1st year of age. Thirdly, the renal function of children up to 1 year of age should not be assessed from urine flow rate, as in this age group, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) corrected for body size is not comparable with normal adult values. All this stimulated research on biochemical markers that could be determined in untimed urine samples and predict changes in renal function. The aim of work was to establish the normal levels of serum and urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in healthy full-term newborns. Material and methods: Male and female newborns, as well as children in whom the samples were obtained in the first or second day of life, did not differ significantly in terms of their sKIM-1 and uKIM-1 levels.

We retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings of 148 cases of STEC-HUS in a national paediatric nephrology centre over a 13 year period. Results: Renal: Renal ultrasound was performed in 18.2% of cases, of which a hyperechoic renal cortex was the most common finding (19/27). Three cases of renal cortical necrosis and one case of acquired cystic kidney disease were diagnosed on serial ultrasound and MRI imaging. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal radiography (AXR) was performed in 14.2% of cases, of which colonic wall thickening was the most common finding (14/21). On abdominal ultrasound colonic thickening (12/27) and free fluid (10/27) were the most common findings. One case of bowel ischaemia was diagnosed on MRI. Neurological: Neuroimaging was performed in 8.1% of cases, of which bilateral lentiform nuclei and/or thalamic infarctions were the most common abnormality (5/12). Two patients had multi-territorial infarcts including the first reported case of large vessel arterial thrombosis in HUS on imaging.

Oliguria was stopped for 7 days to more than half of the cases (56.2%, n = 18). Duration oliguria to 2 weeks had 8children, and 1 child (3.1%) more than 1 month. Anuria was stopped during second week of ARI in 21% of children (n = 4). In 1 child (5.3%) anuria lasted more than 1 month. Patients with HUS had extrarenal syndromes: damage of gastrointestinal tract (60%, n = 31), central nervous system, cardiovascular system (33, 3%, n = 17), respiratory tract (n = 8, 15.7%), hemostasis system (n = 19, 37.2%), intoxication syndrome. Pathology of nervous system was presented with violation of consciousness (32.4%, n = 16); convulsions (23.5%, n = 12), acute cerebrovascular accident (n = 3). 76.5% (n = 39) of children with HUS had RRT: more than half of patients had hemodialysis, second highest rate of application was combination of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Two children had only peritoneal dialysis, in 2 cases hemodialysis combined with plasmapheresis. In 12 children (23.5%) ARI was treated without RRT. HUS mortality in the Orenburg region in period 2000-2015 was 6 children (11.8%).",

In 2014 a new pathway was introduced. Initially this was for all patients receiving RRT for AKI within PICU, for 5 years post AKI. This has now been lengthened to lifelong and has been extended to all stage 3 AKI. Growing evidence suggests there is increased risk of developing CKD post AKI1,2. We also know CKD is a progressive, yet modifiable disease. By offering this lifelong follow up pathway of care, we hope to modify the progression of the disease post AKI. Material and methods: Patients have been identified for follow up by local link nurses within each centre. This has been aided by the introduction of the new PICANet Renal audit, as each centre within the network is a pilot site for this audit. This follow up pathway involves: \u2022 Creatinine check year 1 & 5 \u2022 Annual BP check \u2022 Annual urine dipstick (+/\u2212 protein:creatinine ratio) \u2022 Formal GFR 1 year and 5 years \u2022 For 5 years this will take place within their local hospital across the network clinics and outcomes collated within the Regional Tertiary Nephrology Centre. After this, if there are no other concerns, the child will be discharged to their GP for ongoing lifelong follow up.",

Introduction: The pathogenesis of tHUS depends on the endothelial damage and disfunction caused by shiga-toxin. As a result the expression of endothelium-derived inter-cellular adhesion molecule, vascular cells adhesion molecules and their soluble fractions (sICAM and sVCAM) may change during acute stage of tHUS accordingly to severity of the disease. The aim of the study was to determine the serum levels of sICAM and sVCAM and their prognostic properties in children with tHUS. Material and methods: We examined 17 children (9 boys) aged 6-128 months (median 33 months) on 2nd-4th day after onset of tHUS, and 10 children (5 boys) of 20-78 months (median 42 months) who recovered from tHUS 6 months up to 5 years before the study. The diagnosis of tHUS was established on the basis of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal injury developed after prodromal haemocolitis. Of 17pts with acute tHUS 14 were anuric, 3 had oliguria. Fifteen needed renal replacement therapy. Ten pts. of comparison group were examined in apparently healthy state, with no symptoms of intercurrent infection. sICAM and sVCAM in blood serum were determined by an immunoensymatic method on the PC Lab analyzer (Adaltis, Italy) using Bender Medsystems test systems.",

However the prognostic value of these biomarkers remains unclear. Introduction: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial-specific growth factor that promotes endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, mediates endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, induces microvascular hyperpermeability and participates in interstitial matrix remodelling. VEGF expression is most prominent in glomerular podocytes and in tubular epithelial cells in the kidney. There remains ongoing work on the role of VEGF in normal renal physiology and in animal models of transplantation where VEGF production may influence susceptibility to acute rejection and chronic allograft damage. Conclusions: VEGF levels were stable in our pRTR and comparable to healthy controls although this was a stable cohort of living related renal transplant recipients who did not have any biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes, which are normally characterised by an acute inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate, tubulitis and endothelialitis. VEGF may be important in the generation of this inflammatory response and the general controlled variation in VEGF production may influence susceptibility to acute allograft rejection. This hypothesis needs to be investigated further in pRTR undergoing episodes of acute allograft rejection. Introduction: Urinary tract infections(UTI) can lead to renal scarring resulting in hypertension and end-stage renal failure. Therefore,different markers such as antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin are studied for early diagnosis of UTI.",

Introduction: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is one of the useful modalities for the critical care of neonates with hyperammonemia caused by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) because the medical therapy will not rapidly clear ammonia and hyperammonemia could cause the poor neurologic outcomes. The rapid reduction of ammonia levels through CRRT may decrease neonate mortality and morbidity. However, CRRT in neonates had many limitations such as vascular access, or hypotension. The CRRT effects upon ammonia levels are poor characterized, and the optimal CRRT prescription for neonatal hyperammonemia remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics of neonates with hyperammonemia receiving CRRT and the CRRT effects upon ammonia levels and outcomes. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of neonates with hyperammonemia caused by IEM who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea between January 2008 and December 2016 where they underwent at least 24 h of CRRT.",

The etiology of IEM included ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (n = 4), citrullinemia (n = 4), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency (n = 2), propionic academia (n = 2), and long-chain L-3-Hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (n = 1). The median age at the time of CRRT initiation and the median duration of CRRT was 5 and 4 days, respectively. The mean blood flow rate was 8 ml/kg/min, and the mean dialysis/replacement flow rate (effluent volume) was 3400 mL/h/1.73 m2, which was higher than flows used in neonates with acute kidney injury. The mean ammonia levels at the CRRT initiation was 1197 \u03bcmol/L and the time required for half reduction in ammonia levels ranged from 6 to 24 (median 12) hours. The mean ammonia levels after 48 h CRRT was 228 \u03bcmol/L. There is no correlation between effluent volume and the time required for half reduction in ammonia levels. Three patients (23%) showed the rebound elevation of ammonia levels after termination of CRRT, and CRRT was restarted during the hospitalization periods. The duration of hospitalization ranged from 4 to 86 (median 37) days, and 4 patients died during follow-up. Conclusions: Clinically significant ammonia clearance can be achieved within 48 h in neonates with hyperammonemia utilizing CRRT. Our study suggested that a higher flow CRRT might not guarantee the rapid reduction in ammonia levels. Results: 72.1% of neonates and 41.67% of infants developed CS-AKI. Statistically significant differences in the incidence of AKI in newborns operated on with or without cardiopulmonary bypass were not found, but in infants there were differences with regard to using bypass for surgical correction (p < 0.001). In the 3rd risk category AKI rate was increased in neonates (45.45%) comparing to infants (10%) (p = 0.049). Statistically significant differences in the development of AKI in neonates and infants in categories 4 and 6 RACHS were not found (p > 0.05). The high incidence of AKI in 4-6 categories was found both in neonates and infants (88.9% of neonates in 4th and 6th RACHS categories; 70% of infants in 4th category and 100% of 6th category).

Introduction: NCS refers to compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery (anterior NCS) or between the aorta and the vertebral body (posterior NTS), with impaired blood outflow often accompanied by distention of the distal portion of the vein. The most common symptoms are gross hematuria, left abdominal pain, varicoceles, proteinuria. It could be asintomatic too. Material and methods: Case 1: 4 years old girl, presented with several recurrent episodes of gross hematuria associated with left abdominal pain; renal function, urinary metabolites and urinary tract US were normal. The abdomen magnetic resonance (acronimo in inglese) showed an entrapment of a retro-aortic left renal vein between the aorta and the vertebral column. Case 2: 11 years old boy, with a history of 4 episodes of gross hematuria associated with lumbar pain; laboratory tests and urinary US were normal. The CT-angiography showed a dilation of initial tract of left renal vein, with a reduced caliber in the portion interposed between abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery. Case 3: 14 years old boy, with mild proteinuria and gross hematuria. Kidney function tests were normal. Abdominal US and CT-angiography showed a dilated left renal vein, with a reduced aorto-mesenteric caliber angle. Results: Because of the variability of symptoms and absence of consensus on diagnostic criteria, the exact prevalence of NCS is unknown.",

Introduction: Lithium carbonate has been used for decades in psychiatry for the treatment of depression and bipolar disorder. However, this medicine has several renal side effects. These include nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, distal renal tubular acidosis and rarely nephrotic syndrome. In addition, lithium intoxication can also lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). Majority of patients recover after lithium treatment discontinuation. Material and methods: An 18-year-old white Caucasian female with anxiety disorder and depression was referred to our hospital because of nephrotic syndrome and anuric AKI. Current medication included lithium carbonate, amitriptylin, quetiapine and zolpidem. She had been on lithium treatment for 2 years. Her lithium serum levels and renal functions had been repeatedly within the normal range. On initial examination, her blood pressure was 132/75 mmHg, she had significant bilateral periorbital edema and swelling of the hands and legs. The following laboratory values were noted: hemoglobin 12.2 g/dl, leukocytes 17.3 \u00d7 10 9 /l, thrombocytes 267 \u00d7 10 9 /l, total protein 40 g/l, serum albumin 22.1 g/l, urea 24.2 mmol/l, creatinine 245 \u03bcmol/l, sodium 120 mmol/l, potassium 6.7 mmol/l, bicarbonate 23 mmol/l, total cholesterol 9.5 mmol/l, serum lithium 1.88 mmol/l (normal range 0.3-1.3 mmol/l). Urinalysis showed total protein to creatinine spot urine ratio 225.5 mg/mmol without hematuria. Ultrasonographic examination of kidneys showed only mild diffuse parenchymal lesion. Results: Percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed and revealed minimal change disease. Lithium therapy was discontinued and symptomatic management with fluid restriction, electrolyte and albumin infusions along with diuretics was initiated. Finally, our patient went into full remission in 31 days after lithium treatment discontinuation. At this time lithium was first not detected in serum of our patient. Conclusions: Lithium administration was a cause of AKI and nephrotic syndrome in our patient. She fully recovered without corticosteroids. Measurement of serum lithium levels was useful in anticipating the time of full remission.",

Material and methods: We report case of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in 14 years old boy with X-linked Alport syndrome (AS). Results: The boy had a history of familial X-linked AS (his elder brother also has morphology of AS with CKD stage 2 and sensoneural deafness stage 3 on third decade), at 1 year he developed hematuria, at 5 yearsproteinuria 1.4 g/l. He received nephroprotective and antiproteinuric therapy with fosinopril, losartan and amlodipine, but despite that proteinuria dramatically increased. Since 9 years he had nephrotic range proteinuria. At 14 years next day after vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and polio he developed nausea, gross hematuria and hypertension and. He was observed and 72 h he became oliguric. Laboratory findings were increasing of serum creatinine to 1087 \u03bcmol/l and urea to 31 mmol/l, serum complement was normal, autoantibodies were negative. He was oliguric and needed dialysis (CVVHD) during 16 days. We performed oral steroid therapy 1 mg/kg, daily steroid pulse-therapy 1000 mg and plasmapheresis with almost complete recovery of kidney function, his serum creatinine was 98 \u03bcmol/l, eGFR (CKD-EPI) 99 ml/min/1,73m 2 . Kidney biopsy showed signs of immunocomplex glomerulonephritis (ICGN) with fibrous and cellular crescents and mesangial granular C3 deposition on immunofluorescence and signs of AS with tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. However within 4 months we observed decline in GFR to 41 ml/min/1,73m 2 . Conclusions: We suggest that preexisting AS can predispose to immunocomplex glomerulonebphritis because of glomerular basement membrane abnormalities. From another hand, despite acute ICGN superimposed on AS may significantly accelerate CKD progression despite efficient treatment with pulses and plasma exchanges.

Introduction: To determine the epidemiology and outcome of a paediatric population presented to a nephrology unit in an urban tertiary centre. Material and methods: The records of consecutive children (0-18 years) with nephrolithiasis were reviewed (January 2008-December 2016). Clinical features, aetiology, recurrence risk, treatment and outcome were retrospectively evaluated. Results: We identified 104 cases: nephrolithiasis (n = 69), nephrocalcinosis (n = 24), and both disorders (n = 11). New nephrolithiasis cases (n = 80) increased through the study period from 2.3% to 11.8%. Age at presentation (median 8.6 years) was below 2 years in 21% and 46% were older than 10 years; mean follow-up was 29 months (2-108). Boys predominate (59%). The most common presenting symptom was flank or abdominal pain (44%). The upper urinary tract was most commonly affected (89%). A metabolic abnormality was identified in 51% of cases: hypocitraturia (57%), hypercalcuria (43%), hyperoxaluria (19%), hyperuricosuria (12%), and cystinuria (2%) without age predominance (p = 0,2). Urinary tract infection (UTI) (24%) was the next most significant aetiology. Children below 2 years of age were more likely to have UTI as a cause than the other age groups (p < 0,01). Cases with UTI were more likely to need surgical treatment (p < 0,01). Sixty-three percent of patients were stone free and 24% had recurrence. DMSA scanning was abnormal in 9/20 cases (45%). In a logistic-regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, weight, dietary errors, type of calculi and recurrence of symptoms, a known family history of nephrolithiasis was associated with an increased risk of a metabolic cause for the calculi (odds ratio = 6,86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1663 to 28,302; p < 0.01).",

Introduction: Voiding dysfunction is a common problem in pediatric practice and is defined for children with voiding symptoms or urinary incontinence. Asthma is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease in which dyspnea and chronic cough are defined to be associated with increase in voiding dysfunction in childhood. Material and methods: Parents of 252 children between 5 and 15 years age group followed by the Pediatrics outpatient clinic in our hospital were asked to complete questionnares of International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) for asthma and dysfunctional voiding and Incontinence Scoring System (DVISS). Children with neurological or urological diseases were excluded. Results: Voiding dysfunction was found in 14.7% of children and according to age groups 81.1% was in 5-10 year age group while 18.9% was in 11-15 years age group (p = 0.001). There was no difference between girls and boys. Voiding dysfunction had a positive correlation with asthma symptoms (p = 0.00). Children with dysfunctional voiding had higher history of wheezing at some point in life (p = 0.009), higher rates of current wheezing (p = 0.002), higher doctor diagnosed asthma (p = 0.02) and higher exercise related wheezing in the last 12 months (p = 0.01).",

Introduction: In 2011, American Academy of pediatrics reported clinical practice guideline for the management of the initial urinary tract infection (UIT) in febrile infants more than 2 months old. In 2001, EAU guidelines just suggested subsequent dosage adjustment of antibiotics to compensate for renal function deficit and some contraindicated drugs in young infants with UTI. There was a lack of clinical guideline for UTI under the age of 2 years. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam compared with cefotaxime as empirical antibiotics treatment for febrile UTI in infants less than 3 months old. Material and methods: Infants less than 3 months old who admitted for febrile UTI between Jan 2014 and Feb 2017 were enrolled, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared according to antimicrobial usage. Results: Eighty three infants (66 boys and 17 girls) were enrolled in this study. Eighteen patients (21.7%) experienced recurrent UTI during the follow-up period. Urine cultures were proven in 76 patients (91.6%), blood cultures were isolated in 9 (10.8%), and ESBL were positive in 13 (15.7%). Thirty five patients (42.2%) were treated with cefotaxime, 39 (47%) were treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, and 8 (9.6%) were treated with switching from a non-carbapenem to a carbapenem. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between cefotaxime and piperacillin-tazobactam treatment groups. Four patients among 35 (11.4%) in cefotaxime group and 12 among 39 (30.8%) in piperacillintazobactam group had recurrent UTI (P = 0.052). Factors associated with recurrence of UTI in infants less than 3 months old were ESBL-producing bacteria in urine culture (P = 0.026), bacteremia (P = 0.009), and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (P = 0.003, P = 0.034, respectively).",

            "text": "Introduction: Hydronephrosis (HN) is a common pathology in pediatric nephrology. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common cause of severe hydronephrosis in children. The evolution of obstructive nephropathy can be envisioned as an overlapping sequence of cellular events, including tubular dilatation, interstitial inflammation, followed by glomerulotubular injury and progressive interstitial fibrosis. Inflammation is mediated by the up-regulation of chemokines, adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and osteopontin. We aimed to investigate whether urine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) might serve as a marker of renal disorder in children with hydronephrosis caused by ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Material and methods: 29 children with severe HN (M-23; F-6; mean age 3.8 \u00b1 5.02 years) were compared with 23 participants with mild HN (mean age 6.29 \u00b1 5.04 yrs) and with 19 (mean age 5.28 \u00b1 4.25 yrs) healthy peers age-and sex-matched. ICAM-1 was measured in urine using ELISA method, and was expressed as ng/ mg Cre. Results: Urine ICAM-1/ uCre levels were significantly higher in HN children than healthy controls (P < 0.01), and in severe HN when compared to mild HN (P < 0.05).

Ultrasonography(USG), Tc99 DMSA scan, Tc99 MAG3 scans and VCUG findings, clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively evaluated. Results: The mean age of the patients were 9.59 \u00b1 7.1 (2-23) years. Antenatal hydronephrosis or MCDK was diagnosed in 71 (81.6%) patients. Seventy-four patients (%85) were diagnosedMCDK within the first month of life. Six(6.9%) patients had grade 1-3 and 4(4.6%) had grade 4-5 VUR in contralateral kidney. Bilateral VUR was present in two(2.3%) patients. Voiding cystourethrography was not performed in 14 patients. None of these patients had hydronephrosis and/or urinary tract infection(UTI). At the follow-up, four patients with VUR underwent ureteral reimplantation and endoscopic subureteric injection was performed in four patients. Nine of VUR patients had UTI and/or hydronephrosis. Three patients with VUR were asymptomatic. Two of them followed-up conservatively and surgical intervention was performed in one patient. Hydronephrosis and/or UTI in patients with VUR were significantly higher than the patients without VUR(p = 0.0001). Ureteropelvic junction stenosis(one obstructive and two non-obstructive) of the solitary kidney was found in three patients, they all were detected postnatally. Eighty seven children(27 girls, 60 boys) with MCDK followed-up at our pediatric nephrology outpatient clinic were included in the study. Ultrasonography(USG), Tc99 DMSA scan, Tc99 MAG3 scans and VCUG findings, clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively evaluated. Conclusions: Routine VCUG in healthy children diagnosed with unilateral MCDK is not necessary in those children without UTI and/or contralateral hydronephrosis. Families should be informed about the signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection and selective screening for VUR should be considered only for patients with contralateral abnormality and/or patients with UTI.",

Material and methods: We examined 6392 cases of children in period 2006-2016 years who treated with UTI in paediatric clinic \u21166 in Orenburg region. There were 3451 (53,9%) girls and 2941 (46,1%) boys from 1 till 15 years. All children underwent special microbiological examination of urine including determination of degree of bacteriuria sectoral sowing on blood agar medium and Endo (Feldman J.M. et al., 1984) and quantitative parameters (Grachev N. et al., 1986) . Species identification allocated urine's bacteria carried out by conventional methods (Birger M.I., 1982) . We determined persistence markers of isolated strains of microorganisms: antilysozyme activity (ALA), antiinterferon activity (AIA) and seroresistance (SR) (Bukharin O.V. et al., 1996) . Results: We established that E. coli prevailed in microbiological structure of UTI (78,9%, n = 5049). Proportion of other bacteria which were isolated from urine was significantly lower (21,1%, n = 1343): Klebsiella (16,8%, n = 1080), Proteus (4,3%, n = 263). We studied also resistance of bacteria isolated from urine to antibiotics. Escherichia coli were resistance to ampicillin (51,5%), amoxicillin (51,5%), 1-st generations of cephalosporins (46%) and penicillins with clavulanic acid (35,5%). Klebsiella were 100% resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin, penicillins with clavulanic acid (30%), 1-st generations of cephalosporins (56%), furans (40%). Proteus exhibit low sensitivity to furans (resistance 45%), ampicillin and amoxycillin (74%), 1-st generations of cephalosporins (100%), 2-nd generations of cephalosporins (38%), 100% to penicillins with clavulanic acid. We determined that microorganism strains isolated from urine of patients with UTI were characterized by high levels of SR, ALA, AIA. Conclusions: These data were used in creation of regional register of antimicrobial resistance paediatric patients with UTI. High levels of SR, ALA, AIA show high persistent and pathological potential of urine's bacteria in pathogenesis of UTI. Introduction: Hydronephrosis is the most common genitourinary system anomaly detected by ultrasound (US) during antenatal period. However, there is no consensus about evaluation and follow-up of these patients in postnatal period. Material and methods: The data of 203 patients followed with hydronephrosis since 2010 were evaluated retrospectively and the role of postnatal ultrasonography (US) in predicting the final diagnosis and need of surgery was investigated. Patient's the first postnatal, second and the last US, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and diuretic renograms (MAG3) were recorded. US findings of different etiologies, anteroposterior diameters (APD) of operated/nonoperated groups are compared. Results: Regarding the renal pelvic APD in the first postnatal US; mild, moderate and severe HN was detected in 23.1%, 34.4%, 42.4% of them respectively. It was determined that according to the first USG, patients with low grade of hydronephrosis had higher recovery rate and first USG findings gave reliable information about prognosis. The risk of obstruction and surgical intervention increased significantly with the increase in the degree of hydronephrosis in the first USG. Renal pelvic APD of \u226411 mm was found to be an important predictor of complete recovery (p < 0.001; AUC: 0.714).",

The prevalence of CAKUT is rather frequent in Turkey due to high rates of consanguineous marriages. In the present study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of CAKUT in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of the patients and to emphasize the importance of genetic inheritance. Material and methods: All patients followed in the pediatric nephrology outpatient clinic and diagnosed as CAKUT between the years 1998-2016 were evaluated. First-degree relatives with previously undiagnosed CAKUT were invited to take part of this study. Urinary tract ultrasounds were performed by the same radiologist and pedigrees were drawn in the participating families. Patients with incomplete duplex system were not included to the study. Results: 1228 of 6695 patients (18%) had been diagnosed as CAKUT. A total of 150 CAKUT patients (12%) and their families accepted to participate in the study. Patients with secondary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (n = 3) and hydronephrosis with extrarenal pelvis (n = 2) were excluded; finally 145 patients and their families were enrolled in the study. Urinary malformations of the index cases were VUR (n = 46), ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction (n = 16), renal hypodysplasia (n = 13), posterior uretral valve (PUV) (n = 13), multicystic dysplastic kidney (n = 8), renal agenesis (n = 5) and other abnormalities (n = 44). Ultrasonographic evaluation was performed on 415 siblings and parents with previously undiagnosed CAKUT. A urinary abnormality was found in 22 first-degree relatives (15%); these were renal agenesis (n = 7), renal hypoplasia (n = 6), ectopic kidney (n = 1), and hydronephrosis (n = 8).",

The United Kingdom (UK) presented new guidelines for imaging procedures for UTI but without providing levels of evidence. The American Academy for Pediatrics (AAP) published revised guidelines for children, including levels of evidence grading. We are unsure which guidelines is suitable for Omani children. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of children below 14 years with UTI between 1992 and 2010, who underwent full investigation at SQUH according to Royal College of Physician (RCP). Three hundred three children were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Out of them, 298 children had completed the data and the required investigations. We calculated the proportion of abnormalities which would have been missed had the new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in UK or AAP, been used instead. Results: Out of all patients, 49 (16%) male, 249 (84%) female, 191 (64%) had recurrent UTI. On the other hand, atypical UTI was present in 116 (39%) patients. E coli in the urine was found in 206 (69%) of the patients, while the other 92 (31%) had non E coli organisms. Hydronephrosis was the most prevalent US finding (in 49 patients).",

DMSA scintigraphy revealed renal scarring in 9 (17%) patients, which was not associated with gender, age of CIC initiation or current age, level of spinal lesion, ambulatory disability or none of urodynamic parameters except low bladder capacity. Significant risk factors for renal scarring are shown in Table 1 . There was no difference between eGFR values of the patients with or without scarring, whereas serum cystatin C levels were significantly higher in patients with scarring (0.80 \u00b1 0.20 vs 0.63 \u00b1 0.09, p = 0.03). Introduction: Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) constitute 20 to 30% of all malformations identified in the prenatal period, with the overall rate of 0.3 to 1.6 per 1000 newborns. CAKUT are the most common cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in the pediatric population. The goal of prenatal screening is to identify pathologic conditions that would require postnatal therapy in order to prevent or delay these complications. This study aims to determine the incidence rate of CAKUT in newborn and their clinical and imagiologic outcomes. Material and methods: Retrospective study of medical reports of infants born at Centro Hospitalar P\u00f3voa de Varzim/Vila do Conde, Portugal from 2001 to 2016. Hydronephrosis was defined an anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis (APD) \u2265 5 mm and has been classified in mild (5-9 mm), moderate (\u226510-14 mm) or severe (\u226515 mm).

Little evidence has been accumulated to determine the importance of antenatal detection of renal pelvis dilatation (RPD) and its association with pathology postnatally. We retrospectively audited all infants born from 2009 to 2013 with RPD and followed their postnatal course in an aim to determine critical RPD dimensions and the importance of associated risk factors. Material and methods: We collected data retrospectively on all patients identified by the obstetric ultrasound department as having RPD antenatally in a tertiary neonatal unit with approx. 6500 births a year. The data was compared to and reflected upon the RPD guideline used across Scotland for identifying infants with significant RPD antenatally and their postnatal management. The data was statistically analysed to determine the risk factors and prognostic factors in outcome of RPD detected antenatally.",

Of the high risk patients 53 continued to be high risk, with 18 requiring surgery and 8 had UTI. Those that became low risk did not require surgery or UTI. One that did not attend the follow up scan required surgery and had a UTI. Of the low risk patients 11 became high risk with 4 requiring surgery and 5 having breakthrough UTI. Those that continued to be low risk did not require surgery with one UTI. One that did not attend follow up had 1 UTI. In total 24 required surgery, 11 female, 13 male. Thirty-seven percent of females required surgery compared to 17% of males referred. The females had 1 or two risk factors each, however of the boys 4 had one risk factor and 2 had no risk factors, 1 of which did not have high risk RPD dimensions. Fifteen patients had a breakthrough UTI despite trimethoprim prophylaxis. One patient had a UTI not on prophylaxis, however this infant had RPD >15 mm. Fifty-nine referred to nephrology. Conclusions: Risk factors and RPD >15 mm were the strongest indicator for development of significant RPD requiring surgery or resulting in symptomatic UTI. High risk patients who became low risk at second remained at risk of UTI and surgery. Low risk patients who became high risk became at risk of surgery and UTI. Those who continued to be low risk did not require surgery. Incidence of breakthrough UTI whilst on prophylaxis reflects the need for a high index of suspicion of UTI in a child with RPD. The guideline reflects infants who are at risk of ongoing renal and urology problems postnatally and highlights the importance of follow up in all patients. Introduction: Occipital horn syndrome is an X-linked recessive connective tissue disorder caused by a deficiency in the transport of copper. The disorder is considered a milder variant of Menkes disease, associated with mutations in the ATP7A gene. Children may present with features such as intractable diarrhea, bladder diverticula or recurrent UTI. Motor development is delayed due to muscle hypotonia. Inguinal hernia is common. Arterial aneurysms have also been described. Deformations in the skeleton are present. Diagnosis is based on the clinical features and confirmed by identification of a mutation in the ATP7A gene. Radiography shows characteristic occipital horns which are symmetric exostoses protruding from the occipital bone. Material and methods: We present a 6,5 year old boy with Occipital horn syndrome who has a large bladder diverticula.",

Aim: Descriptive clinical study of children whose parents neglected nephro-urological follow-up. This illustrative presentation aims to emphasize the role of pediatric nephrologist and urologist in a long term care of dysraphic patients. Material and methods: From the clinical database of myelomeningocele the patients who had ceased their regular follow-up and in whom serious urological complication occurred were identified. Their medical files were analyzed in details including initial urological management and the results of diagnostic imaging and functional studies. Results: Seven children (3 girls, 4 boys) with neurogenic bladder dysfunction were included into this study. They had been lost for follow-up review for 4-13 years. During this period the parents / guardians had not been following the principles of nephrological /urological management. Two of them were re-admitted on emergency basis due to ventriculoperitoneal shunt dysfunction. One girl was admitted to intensive care station with sudden incidence of cardiorespiratory insufficiency in the course of undetected chronic kidney failure. Two children were referred by a local pediatricians because of significant kidney dilatation detected on USG scan and recurrent urinary tract infection.

Early diagnostis and immediate surgical treatment could prevent the further renal damage. Introduction: One of the most efficient methods of preventing renal damage due to neuromuscular dysfunction of bladder in patients with spinal dysraphism is a clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC). However, this treatment causes the emergence of catheter-associated bacteriuria (CAB) and / or urinary tract infection (UTI) that both can be called as a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections / CAUTI). Material and methods: All patients who were admitted to Zhytomyr Regional Children's Clinical Hospital with the neurogenic bladder and whom the CIC was administered, were subjected to the mandatory microbiological examination of urine. In case of therapeutic failure of the conservative treatment and the progressive renal damage, surgical treatment has been employed.

Introduction: The non-ionic agent iohexol is increasingly seen as the marker of choice for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement. Since estimated GFR (eGFR) has low accuracy in children and limitation of number of blood draws to a minimum is especially relevant in children, we performed a study to evaluate different methods and find the optimal sampling point for calculating measured GFR (mGFR) based on iohexol clearance with a blood sample drawn at only one time-point (GFR1p). Material and methods: 96 children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), median age 9.2 years, range 3 months to 17.5 years, were examined using iohexol plasma clearance and blood sampling at seven time points within five hours (GFR7p) as the reference method. Median GFR7p was 65.9 mL/ min/1.73 m2, range 6.3-153 mL/min/1.73 m2.

            "text": "Conclusions: Automated reporting of estimated GFR in children is feasible and increases early detection of children with CKD. If the estimated GFR is greater than 80 ml/min per 1.73m 2 and there are no other risk factors for CKD then ultrasound is not required. Introduction: The degree of proteinuria predicts progression of renal failure in adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While lowering of proteinuria by various interventions has been demonstrated to be nephroprotective in adults with proteinuric nephropathies, pediatric data on the relationship of pharmacotherapeutic proteinuria lowering and long-term renal survival is scarce. Here we have revisited the ESCAPE Trial to investigate a potential quantitative association of the initial antiproteinuric effect of standardized ACE inhibition with subsequent renal disease progression in children with CKD. Material and methods: All children were started on a fixed dose of ramipril (6 mg/m 2 /day) and randomized to aim for conventional or intensified blood pressure control. The initial log-transformed change in proteinuria was assessed from baseline to first measurement after starting ramipril (at 2.6 \u00b1 1.4 months). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between initial proteinuria change and risk of reaching the renal endpoint (composite of 50% decline in eGFR or progression to endstage-renal disease), adjusted for age, gender, CKD diagnosis, baseline proteinuria, blood pressure, eGFR and change in blood pressure. Results: Of 285 eligible patients (59% male, age 11.5-3.9 years), 85 reached the endpoint within 5 years of follow-up. Proteinuria was reduced following start of ramipril treatment by a median of 40% (interquartile range 8-64%). As compared to a reduction in proteinuria of less than 30%, a 30-60% reduction accounted for a HR of 0.65 (CI 0.38-1.12) and reduction of more than 60% gave a HR of 0. Introduction: Children born with low birth weight (LBW) have higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) because of a low number of nephrons. Some develop proteinuria and decreased renal function as early as childhood. However, no effective therapy has been established to suppress the progression of CKD in children with LBW. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation plays a critical role in the development of hypertension and CKD, and our previous work demonstrated that urinary angiotensinogen (uAGT) is a useful marker of intrarenal RAS activation. The aim of this study was to assess whether treatment with RAS blockade is beneficial for suppressing the progression of CKD in children with LBW using uAGT as a surrogate marker. Material and methods: We recruited 11 children with LBW who were started on RAS blockade with Candesartan between April 2013 and August 2016 to treat hypertension or proteinuria. The mean birth weight was 797.8 \u00b1 282.6 g, and the mean age at evaluation was 13.8 \u00b1 3.5 years. We compared uAGT, blood pressure, urinary protein, serum electrolytes, and renal function before and after treatment with Candesartan.",

Urinary protein was also significantly decreased (p = 0.003), although there were no significant changes in blood pressure, serum sodium and potassium, or estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine.

Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was assessed in a fresh morning urine sample in children only, and elevated ACR was defined as ACR > 30 mg/g. The study population included 46 pediatric patients with CKD (10 dialysis depedent, all in peritoneal dialysis) and 68 controls. Children with CKD had higher scores in the subscale of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), but the incidence of SDB was not statistically different to that of the control group. Pediatric patients with CKD had higher frequency of insomnia (20% vs. 3% controls, P < 0.01), excessive daytime sleepiness (26.7% vs. 1.5% in controls, P < 0.001) and nocturnal awakenings (21.4% vs. 1.5% in controls, P < 0.001). Among patients with CKD, dialysis dependent patients presented higher scores in restless legs syndrome scale compared to patients with CKD non-dialysis dependent (P < 0.05), but not in other scales' scores ( Figure 1 ).",

Therefore, clinicians caring for these children should always bear this in mind, in order to improve quality of medical care. Introduction: Different pulmonary or systemic conditions are associated with pulmonary calcifications, also described as calcium salt storages in lungs. A well accepted classification distinguishes metastatic calcifications where calcium storage occurs in a previously normal lung, from dystrophic calcifications, in which calcium is accumulated in a damaged lung. Though MPC is a quite rare condition, adult patients with CKD in hemodialysis (HD) often show this pulmonary pattern due to chronic calcium-phosphate imbalance. Material and methods: We report a case of a 12-year-old female with previous history of CKD in chronic PD treatment for 7 years and then in chronic HD due to peritoneal membrane failure. She was admitted to our Pediatric Nephrology Unit for urgent kidney transplantation without any symptoms. Routine preliminary investigations revealed a remarkable calcium-phosphate imbalance with a high level of intact parathyroid hormone (1326 ng/L) and high levels of calcium and phosphate as seen in secondary hyperparathyroidsm. The inflammatory markers were not meaningful.",

However, MCP must be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained lung opacities in children with CKD, mainly in the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidsm and strong clinical-radiological dissociation. Results: Serum aluminum was measured randomly in 6 patients, results were normal ranging from 12 to 22 \u03bcg/l.When serum ferritin was <100 ng/ml during therapy,they received iron supplementation.According to the response, patients were divided into 2 groups,the non -responders group with HCT < 27,mean age (9.97 \u00b1 3.55) years, with mean iPTH (669.9 \u00b1 461.77) pg/ml and group of responders with HCT > 27 with mean age (11.66 \u00b1 4.32) years, with mean iPTH (261.19 \u00b1 233.17) pg/ml,15 HD patients never reached target HCT at this dose versus 2 patients on conservative treatment; By comparison between both groups as regards laboratory values, it shows reticulocytic count,iPTH and serum ferritin were significantly higher in the non-responders(NR) versus the responders(R) with p values (p = 0.04,p = 0.006,p = 0.04) respectively,while serum calcium,albumin were significantly lower between NR versus R with pvalues (p = 0.007,p = 0.003) respectively.Inspite that iron, TIBC,% transferin saturation and KT/V shows non significant difference between NR and R group, also caloric intake as % of recommended daily allowance shows non significant difference between both groups.However intact parathormone levels were significantly higher before and after 16 weeks of erythropoetin (EPO) therapy in the NR versus R groups, P < 0.05 versus p = 0/006 respectively. Conclusions: So we conclude that in the absence of other well-known response-limiting factors, the erythropoetic response to erythropoetin therapy depends largely on the extent of secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

            "text": "Maren Leifheit-nestler 1 Introduction: FGF23 is discussed as a new biomarker associated with cardiac hypertrophy and mortality in patients with CKD, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock that promotes diastolic dysfunction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death.Since we previously demonstrated that FGF23 is expressed by cardiac myocytes, enhanced in CKD, and causes cardiac hypertrophy via activation of FGFR4/calcineurin/NFAT signaling, we aimed to investigate whether induction of cardiac FGF23 associates with myocardial fibrosis in uremia and directly promotes profibrotic crosstalk of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study including 24 myocardial autopsy samples from CKD patients and investigated cardiac fibrosis by histological quantification of fibrillar collagens and fibrosis RT 2 profiler PCR array analyzes. Data were correlated with clinical parameters, cardiac FGF23, and klotho levels. The specific impact of FGF23-mediated induction of cardiac fibrosis was further evaluated in isolated cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. Results: Accumulation of fibrillar collagens was increased in myocardial tissue of CKD patients and correlated with duration of dialysis, klotho deficiency, and enhanced angiotensinogen expression. TGF-\u03b2 and its related TGF-\u03b2 receptor/Smad complexes, extracellular matric remodeling enzymes, as well as pro-fibrotic growth factors were significantly upregulated in myocardial tissue of dialysis patients. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, FGF23 stimulated pro-fibrotic TGF-\u03b2 receptor/Smad complexes and collagen synthesis, whereas treatment of isolated cardiac myocytes with FGF23 resulted in enhanced collagen remodeling, induction of pro-survival pathways, proinflammatory and pro-hypertrophic genes. Angiotensin II and aldosterone, as components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), strongly induced FGF23 in cardiac myocytes and FGF23 further stimulated angiotensinogen expression in both cardiac cell types. Conclusions: Cardiac FGF23 is stimulated by RAAS components in cardiac myocytes to directly promote fibrotic and hypertrophic response. Secreted by cardiac myocytes, FGF23 induces pro-fibrotic pathways and collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts in a paracrine fashion, suggesting that FGF23 impact on both pathological cardiac remodeling processes. (1,25D) and klotho with the development of cardiovascular events, e.g. endothelial dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and myocardial fibrosis. However, 1,25D and klotho ameliorate myocardial hypertrophy in vivo, and klotho suppresses cardiac fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis, and protects against FGF23-mediated oxidative stress in vitro. Material and methods: We investigated the cardiac phenotype in two mouse models of FGF23 excess and klotho deficiency, i) klotho hypomorphic (Kl \u2212/\u2212 ) mice presenting with high plasma levels of phosphate, 1,25D, and FGF23, as well as suppressed PTH, and ii) Hyp mice presenting with elevated FGF23 and PTH, but low phosphate and 1,25D levels in parallel with reduced renal klotho expression. Results: In both mouse models relative heart weight and cross-sectional area of individual cardiac myocytes were larger than in respective wildtype controls. In Kl \u2212/\u2212 mice, cardiac Fgf23, Fgfr4 and calcineurin/NFAT signaling as well as pro-hypertrophic genes Rcan1, BNP, ANP, bMHC were clearly induced. Investigation of transcription factors and fibrosisrelated molecules characteristic for pathological cardiac remodeling processes demonstrated enhanced expression of Cebpb and Gata4, as well as Tgfb1, collagen I, and Mmp2 in Kl \u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, Hyp mice showed significantly enhanced cardiac Fgf23 mRNA levels and high intact cardiac Fgf23 protein, but the induction of Fgfr4/calcineurin/ NFAT pathway, BNP, ANP and bMHC expression, and stimulation of pro-fibrotic factors was absent when compared to respective wild-type controls. Conclusions: Our data suggest that despite of high circulating and cardiac FGF23 levels and enhanced PTH, as well as reduced renal klotho and 1,25D synthesis, Hyp mice appear to be protected against the development of cardiac pathology possibly at least partly due to hypophosphatemia. In contrast, Kl \u2212/\u2212 mice present with strong induction of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis despite high 1,25D plasma levels. Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is rare in neonates. RRT in neonates is expensive, time consuming and difficult. Very little data about neonatal CKD is available from the developing countries. Material and methods: All neonates with evidence with CKD from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed. Follow up serum creatinine was recorded every six months. Results: Total of 181 children presentedwith CKD. Their mean age at presentation was 11.1 days (95% CI 9.5-12.8) and the mean creatinine was 106.5 uml/l (95% CI 91.3-121.7). Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) was the underlying cause in 84.5%. Mortality was high particularly in the first 6 months (10%) and reached 16% by 4 years of follow up. Younger age at presentation, male sex and hypertension were associated with higher mortality. On the last follow up 42 (41%) children had hypertension and 27 (26.5%) had significant proteinuria. Five children had received dialysis in the neonatal period and another 6 were started dialysis later on. Conclusions: Management of advanced CKD in neonates is challenging particularly in developing countries.",

We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmaco kinetics(PK), and pharmacodynamics(PD) of a single dose of cinacalcet in children with secondary hyperparathyroidism(sHPT) receiving dialysis. Material and methods: Twelve subjects (28 days to <6 years old) received a single 0.25 mg/kg dose of cinacalcet. The dose was administered orally (syringe) or by nasogastric or gastric (NG/G) tube. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to two parathyroid hormone [PTH] and serum calcium sampling sequences post-dose: (1) 2, 8, and 48 h; or (2) 2, 12, and 48 h. Subjects were followed for 72 h after dosing for the study assessments. Results: Cinacalcet median t max was 1 h (range: 0.50 to 4.0 h). Plasma cinacalcet mean (SD) C max and AUC last were 2.83(1.98)ng/mL and 11.8(8.74)hr.\u2022ng/mL, respectively. The mean (SD) half-life (t 1/2,z ) was 3.70(2.57)hours. Subject age, weight, body surface area, and BMI did not have an effect on the PK of cinacalcet. Reductions in serum PTH concentrations from baseline were observed at 2 h and 8 h post-dose (median: \u221210.8% and \u221229.6%, respectively), and returned to near baseline levels at 72 h (\u22125.4%). These reductions correlated with changes in plasma cinacalcet concentrations. Safety findings were similar to safety profile observed in adults. Conclusions: A single dose of cinacalcet was well-tolerated in pediatric patients. Cinacalcet was rapidly absorbed and eliminated with no notable effects of age, weight, body surface area, and BMI on cinacalcet PK. Discernable reductions in serum iPTH were observed up to 8 h after a single 0.25 mg/kg dose of cinacalcet and returned to baseline by 72 h. Results from this study indicate that a 0.25 mg/kg dose of cinacalcet is deemed an appropriate safe starting dose in children 28 days to <6 years of age.

Material and methods: The study included 65 children: 10 predialysis patients with CKD (mean age: 10.50 \u00b1 2.27 years), 13 patients undergoing HD (mean age: 11.92 \u00b1 3.13 years), 12 patients undergoing PD (mean age: 11.42 \u00b1 3.18), and 30 healthy controls (mean age: 10.11 \u00b1 3.74).",

NT-proBNP levels of HD and PD patients were statistically higher compared with the control group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001), there was no difference between pre-dialysis patients and the control group. OH, Rel OH, E/I levels of HD and PD patients significantly increased compared with the pre-dialysis and control group. Left atrium diameter, early dialostic flow velocity/late diastolic flow velocity (E/A) in HD and PD patients, and left ventricle mass index in HD, PD and predialysis patients were significantly higher compared with the control group. A positive correlation between NT-proBNP and OH, Rel OH, E/I, left atrium diameter, left ventricle mass index and a negative correlation with E/A was detected. Conclusions: NT-proBNP and body fluid load was found to be increased in dialysis patients and these pararmeters were associated with left ventricle systolic and diastolic function parameters. Therefore, we believe that the routine use of NT-proBNP in children with chronic kidney failure has importance for close follow-up and prognosis of patients. Introduction: As kidney function deteriorates, uraemic toxins accumulate and contribute to the clinical picture of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These children are reporting poorer overall quality of life (QoL) and poorer physical, school, emotional, and social functioning. The aim of this study was to explore the association between levels of uraemic toxins and QoL. Material and methods: In 23 children (11.0[6.9;14 .6]years, 61%boys) with non-dialysis CKD stage 1-5, plasma concentrations of small solutes (asymmetric dimethyl arginine, symmetric dimethyl arginine, creatinine), middle molecules (\u03b22microglobuline, complement factor D), and protein-bound solutes [p-cresylglucuronide, hippuric acid (HA), indole acetic acid (IAA), indoxyl sulfate, pcresylsulfate, and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-furanpropionic acid (CMPF)] were measured. Their parents were asked to fill in the general (PedsQLTM 4.0 Generic Core: total score, physical & education subscale) and disease-specific QoL questionnaire (PedsQLTM End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): disease & fatigue subscale). Lasso regression was used as an explorative method to select a set of predictive uraemic toxins (when \u03b2 \u2260 0) in models for the PedsQL questionnaires. Results: The mean estimated GFR was 50.4 [31.2;74.5]mL/min/1.73 m2. CMPF was found to predict the total PedsQL (\u03b2 = \u22120.34) and physical PedsQL subscales score (\u03b2 = \u22121.19). Besides CMPF, IAA was predominant in the prediction of the total PedsQL and physical PedsQL subscale score(respectively \u03b2 = \u22120.84 and \u03b2 = \u22121.26); and HA in the education PesdsQL subscale (\u03b2 = \u22120.31). The disease subscale of the PedsQL ESRD questionnaire was predominantly predicted by HA (\u03b2 = \u22121.18) and IAA (\u03b2 = \u22122.30). Using this model, creatinine was for none of the questionnaires selected as a possible predictor. Conclusions: This model selected CMPF, IAA and HA as promising predictors for the hard endpoint QoL in children with CKD. Moreover, creatinine was not selected as a possible predictor for any of the QoL measures. A more extensive longitudinal study is necessary to strengthen our findings about the impact of uraemic toxins on the QoL in children with CKD. Introduction: Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Arterial stiffening measured by wave pulse velocity (PWV) predicts cardiovascular events and mortality in adults. Defining arterial stiffness may help to determine the cardiovascular risk. Objectives: Investigate wave pulse velocity among children and adolescents with CKD. Material and methods: In this cross-sectional study 57 patients (61.4% male), age 6.2-17.5 years, 44 with non-dialysis CKD and 13 on chronic dialysis were included in the analysis. The WPV was measured with an oscillometric device with inbuilt ARCSolver-algorithm (estimated by using the brachial waveform) and compared with previously established percentiles for PWV. Results: The prevalence of elevated WPV was 21.1%. In multivariate logistic regression, it was noted a higher risk of elevated WPV in patients on chronic dialysis when compared with non-dialysis CKD patients (PRadj = 4.31, 95%CI:1.26-14.83, p = 0.020). Hypertensive patients (stage 2) have a higher risk of elevated WPV when compared with normotensives (PRadj = 3.11, 95%CI:1.17-8.24, p = 0.022) as the patients younger than 12 years comparing with the older patients (PRadj = 3.41, 95%CI:1.25-9.29, p = 0.017). Conclusions: The findings suggest that lower ages, dialysis and hypertension in children and adolescents are independently associated with the increase of WPV. Further researches are needed to clarify these relations with cardiovascular complications in children and adolescents with CKD. Introduction: Markers of cardiovascular disease have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CDK). Serum uric acid (UA) is related to hypertension and increase the cardiovascular risk. These surrogate markers have been commonly used to study the evolution of cardiovascular disease in children with CKD. The measurement of the intima-media thickness (IMT) has become an additional tool for the early detection of arterial injury and evaluation of cardiovascular risk in these patients. Objective: Evaluate the serum uric acid level, hypertension, the use of allopurinol and its relationship with IMT in patients with CKD. Material and methods: This cross sectional study included 55 patients (60% males), aged 11.7 years (6.2-17.4 years), 43 with non dialysis treatment and 12 on chronic dialysis. Serum levels of UA were obtained for all patients. Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report of Blood Pressure in Children as BP > 95th percentile or when the patient received anti-hypertensive medications. The IMT were evaluated by ultrasonography by the same examiner and compared with established percentiles for IMT according to gender and height. Results: We found that 25 (45.45%) patients had elevated serum UA, 23 (41.8%) were on allopurinol treatment, 18 (32.7%) were hypertensives and in this group 94% had IMT altered. In multivariate logistic regression there was a higher chance of elevated IMT in patients who were not on allopurinol treatment (PR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.01; 1.74; p = 0.047) and hypertensive patients (PR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.04; 1.58; p = 0.023). Conclusions: Ours findings suggest that no allopurinol treatment and hypertension were independently associated with increased of IMT. Further studies are needed to elucidated these relations. Close monitoring of blood pressure, treatment of hypertension, monitoring of UA and its treatment with allopurinol are important prevention of cardiovascular disease progression. Introduction: The measurement of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, can be expensive and time-consuming, and there is no clear evidence of its interest in the management of patients with nephrolithiasis (NL) and/or nephrocalcinosis (NC). The aim of this study was to study our current practice of 1-25 vitamin D3 (1-25-D) assessment in order to evaluate its interest in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of children with NL/NC. Material and methods: We retrospectively studied all pediatric patients having undergone at least one 1-25-D measurement in our pediatric nephrology unit between December 2014 and November 2015. Clinical, biological and radiological (ultrasounds) data were recorded. Results: A total of 264 measurements of 1-25-D levels were performed in 200 patients (age range 1 month to 18 years). The primary renal diseases were the following: 39% NL, 18% NC, 14% transplantation, 5% nephrotic syndrome, 3% neonatal hypercalcemia, 3% hypercalcemia, 2% rickets, 1% tubulopathy, and 15% miscellaneous. In the 113 patients with NC or NL (mean age 6.4 \u00b1 5.5 years, 73 boys), the etiology of NC/NL were the following: 27% unexplained despite extensive investigations, 15% neonatal hypercalcemia, 11% hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia, 10% urinary malformations, 9% infections, 6% nutritional mistake, 5% hypervitaminosis D, 4% hypercalcemia hypercalciuria, 4% tubulopathy, 3% hyperoxaluria, 6% miscellaneous. 1-25-D levels were found inappropriately high in 39 (35%) patients and further led to the diagnosis of CYP24A1 mutation in 3 patients and of vitamin D hypersensitivity without any identified mutation in 3 patients. Moreover, it modified the clinical management in 54 (47%) patients. Conclusions: Assessment of 1-25D levels modifies clinical management in 47% of patients, mainly by allowing an adaptation of native vitamin D supplementation. In 5% of pediatric patients with NC and/or NL, it also clearly improves the diagnostic strategy. It therefore seems useful in the evaluation of NC/NL in children. Introduction: Prediction of clinical outcome in Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein nephritis (HSN) patients is difficult. Histological findings of sequential kidney biopsies from HSN patients were classified using the ISKDC (International Study of Kidney Disease in Children) classification and a novel semiquantitative classification (SQC) and their prognostic value on patient outcomes were compared. Material and methods: Sequential kidney biopsies from 26 HSN patients were re-evaluated using the ISKDC classification and the SQC. SQC scores renal findings (glomerular, tubular, interstitial and vascular) and gives a total biopsy score as well as activity and chronicity indices. The biopsy findings based on the two classification systems were compared to the clinical findings at the last control visit. Nineteen (73%) patients had no signs of renal disease or minor urinary abnormalities (good outcome) and seven (27%) had active renal disease or chronic kidney disease (poor outcome). Median follow-up time was 8.5 years and time elapsed between the biopsies was 2.1 years.",

Changes between biopsies in the activity index, chronicity index and ISKDC grading occurred similarly in both outcome groups (Figure) .",

Activity scores decreased and chronicity scores increased between primary and follow-up biopsy despite patient outcome. The control biopsy does not seem to be indicated routinely, but needs to be decided individually. Introduction: Vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) is an important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) are vasoactive substances which was affected in ESRD. The aim of the study was to compare serum ET-1 and NO levels in renal transplant recipients (RTx group) and patients receiving hemodialysis (HD group), online-hemodiafiltration (HDF group), peritoneal dialysis (PD group). Material and methods: Fourty-one patients and 25 healthy children were enrolled in the study. Serum ET-1 and NO levels were measured by ELISA in all patients and controls. Intradialytic symptoms and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was evaluated in HD and HDF groups. Results: Rtx group had the lowest level of serum ET-1 and NO although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Median serum ET-1 level were not significantly different between the HD and HDF group (589.944 ng/l and 593.717 ng/l; respectively, p > 0.05). Also, these levels were not different between the PD, RTx and HD groups (546.343 ng/l, 343.555 and 589.944 ng/l; respectively, p > 0.05). Median ET-1 level were significantly lower in RTx group than the HDF group (343.555 ng/l and 593.717 ng/l; respectively, p = 0.025). The median serum NO level was not different between the HD, HDF, PD and RTx groups (590.237 \u03bcmol/l, 563.084 \u03bcmol/l, 582.433 \u03bcmol/l, 438.268 \u03bcmol/l; respectively, p > 0.05). There was no difference between the HD and HDF groups in terms of hypertension, hyperparathyroidism, anemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, inter-dialytic weight gains and Kt/v (p > 0.05). When each patient groups were compared with the control group separately NO and ET-1 levels were higher in patient groups (p = 0.0001). Median NO level was 56.212 \u03bcmol/l, ET-1 level was 31.827 ng/l in the control group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ESRD causes VED. No difference between ESRD treatment modalities (HD, HDF, PD) in terms of ET-1 and NO indicates that VED continues in all treatment modalities. Renal transplantation is superior to other treatment modalities. Introduction: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a serious health problem in Armenian children. Although amyloidosisa potentially fatal complication of FMFcan largely be prevented by colchicine administration, we are still confronted with renal amyloidosis. The aim was to analyse the demography and reasons for amyloid nephropathy in pediatric patients and the late effects of colchicine. Material and methods: The National Pediatric Center for FMF (NPC FMF) was established in 1998 to allow early diagnosis, treatment, followup and wide dissemination of information on FMF. Since 2003 NPC FMF has provided colchicine at no charge to over 3000 children below the age of 18 years. Diagnosis of FMF is based on Tel-Hashomer criteria and molecular genetic analysis (since 1998). Amyloid nephropathy was confirmed by renal biopsy (Congo Red). All pediatric renal biopsies since 1993 (n = 307) are included. The data 1993-2004 (group 1; n = 155) and 2005-2016 (group 2; n = 152) have been analyzed separately. Colchicine was administered to all patients with renal amyloidosis. Results: Amyloid nephropathy was diagnosed in 38 pts. (24.5%) in group 1 and in 22 (14.5%) in group 2 (p < 0.05). In the second group diagnosis of FMF had been missed in 18 patients, one was noncompliant and in three colchicine was not sufficiently effective. On admission six had proteinuria, 14 were nephrotic and two had CKD (stage 3). Late administration of colchicine could not reverse the course. Conclusions: The National long-term program on early diagnosis and regular colchicine treatment of FMF in children in Armenia is only partly effective in prevention of renal amyloidosis and requires additional efforts. Colchicine is not able to reverse advanced amyloid nephropathy. Results: 80 patients with anemia in CKD32 patients (I Group) with CKD had mean GFR 42.89 \u00b1 25,2 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ; Hb level 103.2 \u00b1 8.5 g/dl, EPO level was 28.1 \u00b1 20.6 mIU/ml; HIF-1\u03b1 levels 0,163 \u00b1 0,4 pg/ml. Eighteen patients (II Group) had mean GFR 31.5 \u00b1 26.4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ; Hb level 100 \u00b1 10 g/dl, EPO level was 118 \u00b1 25.4 mIU/ml; HIF-1\u03b1 levels 0.12 \u00b1 0.1 pg/ml. Thirty patients (III Group) had mean GFR 13.1 \u00b1 6,2 ml/ min/1.73 m 2 ; Hb level 85 \u00b1 14,4 g/dl, EPO level was 34.3 \u00b1 43,8 mIU/ml; HIF-1\u03b1 levels 0.09 \u00b1 0,07 pg/ml. EPO level in children II Group was higher, compared with I and III Group (p < 0.05). HIF-1\u03b1 correlated with GFR by18 patients II Group (R = 0,589, p < 0.05), by 32 patients I group (R = 0, 42), by 30 patients III group (R = 0,087). Conclusions: We identified the evolution in indicators HIF-1\u03b1 in children with anemia in CKD. In parallel with a decrease GFR, the tightness of the connection between HIF-1\u03b1 and GFR decreases. Introduction: Cephalosporins, particularly cefepime, exert neurotoxic side effects that can lead to status epilepticus. These neurotoxic side effects include myoclonus, dystonic movements, tremor, asterixis, seizure, status epilepticus, encephalopathy, and sometimes coma. Status epilepticus, particularly nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), is a well-known but unusual complication in patients with altered renal function who were receiving treatment with intravenous cephalosporins, especially cefepime. Cardiotoxicity due to cephalosporins is not reported yet. Material and methods: Here we report a chronic peritoneal dialysis patient who received cefepime for peritonitis. Results: He developed tremor and asterixis on the 6 th day of treatment. His electroencephalography revealed status epilepticus and considered to be in a state of non-convulsive status. Electrocardiography revealed frequent ventricular extrasistoles, while his echocardiographic examination revealed slight ventricular hypertrophy. Cefepime was discontinued immediately. His neurological symptoms subsided in 24 h while arrhythmia subsided in a week. Conclusions: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus was observed between 2 and 8 days (average of 5.6 days) after initiation of cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are epileptogenic drugs, especially when used in excessive doses or when renal function is impaired. Critically ill patients with chronic kidney disease are particularly susceptible to cefepime neurotoxicity. However, there is not any reported case related to cardiotoxicogenic or arrhythmogenic affect of cefepime in literature. Cefepime should be used carefully in patients with renal failure. Its neurotoxic and arrhythmogenic affect should be kept in mind.",

Multiple factors have been proposed to explain its' occurrence including gastroesophageal reflux and delayed gastric emptying. Material and methods: We retrospectively report 3 patients with CKD who were receiving enteral feeds and experienced issues with vomiting. Results: Patient 1: 28 month old girl with CKD following placental abruption. Vomiting daily for the previous 5 months despite domperidone. Care transferred to our unit with plan for fundoplication. On presentation 110mls/kg/d total water from gastrostomy feeds and oral water. Initially feeds changed to \u00bc strength and total water (all sources) increased to 145mls/kg/d. Vomiting settled and feeds increase to full strength over 2 week period. Patient 2: 3 day old boy with PUV and left multicystic dysplastic kidneys. Feeds provided 180mls/kg/d water and family advised to offer water between feeds. Two weeks later started vomiting, had outgrown 180mls/kg/d target and parents admitted difficulty giving additional water. Additional water added to feeds to achieve 180mls/kg/d and vomiting settled. No anti-reflux medications required. Patient 3: 1 month old girl with dysplastic kidneys tolerated continuous feeds (155mls/kg/d fluid) but would vomit when bolus feeds were trialled. Half strength continuous feeds with increasing water to 170mls/ kg/d were not tolerated. Patient given IV fluids and domperidone over a weekend period then successfully regraded to continuous feeds of 170mls/kg/d.",

There is no formalised, agreed process whereby children are determined to be at nutritional risk. Material and methods: Children aged 3 and 18 years with CKD (stages 2 to 5D) were screened for risk of malnutrition using nutrition screening tools: Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP); Screening Tool for Risk On Nutritional status and Growth (STRONGkids); Simple Paediatric Nutrition Risk Score (PNRS); and Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS). For comparison, the degree of malnutrition was assessed by anthropometry alone using World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria. Results: 60 children with CKD were recruited; 46 of whom were conservatively managed, 10 had previous undergone renal transplantation, and 5 were receiving dialysis (4 haemodialysis, 1 peritoneal dialysis). Mean values (with standard deviations) of age, height SDS, weight SDS and BMI SDS for the cohort were 10.7 years(\u00b14.0), \u22121.19(\u00b11.53),-0.42(\u00b11.76), and 0.46(\u00b11.36), respectively. Ten children(17%) had weight SDS < \u22122. 1 child(1.7%) was under-weight for height(BMI SDS < \u22122). Seventeen children(28%) were short-forage(height SDS < \u22122). There was poor concordance between ICD-10 anthropometric definitions of malnutrition risk and all screening tools. Additionally, there was poor inter-tool agreement; with no 2 tools showing a Cohen's kappa value of greater than 0.2. Conclusions: Although discrepancy is expected, to be a clinically useful screening tool, they must be able to identify those at risk, and not miss individuals that require assessment / intervention. Currently used screening tools are not adequate for stratifying nutritional risk, and standardised nutritional assessment is needed, although inadequate resources for this are in place. Attention must be given to a identifying those at risk from nutritional inadequacy; including adiposity. It therefore seems essential to utilise a specialist paediatric renal dietitian. Introduction: Interrupted Inferior Vena Cava Syndrome (IVCS) is a rare vascular anomaly. Although it usually presents with other congenital anomalies, there is no report about its co-existing with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Material and methods: Here we present a 4-month-old girl with ARPKD and IVCS. Results: Four month-old female patient presented to our clinic due to vomiting which started in the neonatal period but intensified gradually. History of small for gestational age and consanguineous marriage were noted. Growth retardation, tachycardia (140/min), 2/6 systolic murmur, severe hypertension and end-stage renal disease were detected in her physical and laboratory examination. Interrupted inferior vena cava, which continued as a dilated azygos vein to the superior vena cava was detected on abdominal ultrasonography. Left isomerism and polysplenia were found as the component of IVCS. The liver parenchymal echogenicity had risen in accordance with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Bilateral grade 2 hyperechogenicity and multiple ubiquitous millimetric anechoic cysts were seen in renal parenchyma. Echocardiography revealed left ventricle wall and intraventricular septum hypertrophy as a result of chronic hypertension. Cranial ultrasound was normal. Peritoneal dialysis and the relevant medical therapy for end stage renal disease and hypertension has been arranged. Introduction: The final result of chronic kidney disease (CKD) without considering the type of kidney disease is progression to kidney failure and its complications such as renal osteodystrophy, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, acid-base disorders, electrolyte disorders and anemia. Mineral bone disease could be assessed with laboratory abnormalities and radiologic findings. The purpose of this study was assesssing the laboratory abnormalities in renal osteodystrophy and finding a relation with the stage of CKD. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 104 children between 1 month to 17 years old who were admitted to the nephrology ward of Mofid hospital. They were evaluated by history taking, physical examination, blood and urine analysis, ultrasound and echocardiography. According to the glomerular filtration and KDOQI instruction, patients were divided into 5 groups: results were expressed using SPSS statistics and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of 104 cases, 65 patients (62.5%) were male and 39 (37.5%) were female. The age range was 1 month to 17 years old and the mean age was 7.15. Four patients (3.8%) were at stage 1, 14 patients (13.5%) were at stage 2, 15 patients(14.4%) at stage 3 and 71 patients (68.3%) at stages 4 and 5. The most common etiology of CKD was neurogenic bladder with 19 patients (18.2%),then glomerular diseases such as nephrotic syndrome and lupus with 15 patients(14.2%), obstructive uropathy with 12 patients (11.5%), reflux nephropathy and atypical HUS each with 10 patients (9.6%), polycystic kidney disease with 5 patients (4.8%) and other etiologies (like malignancies, nephronophthisis and Bardet-Beidl sundrome) formed 12.5%.Twenty patients (19.9%) had unknown etiology. Eighty two patients (78.8%) had anemia, 30 patients (28.8%) had hypocalcemia, 30 patients (28.8%) had hyperphosphstemia, 75 patients (72.1%) had metabolic acidosis and 34 patients (32.6%) had high alkaline phosphatase. Seventy two patients (69.2%) were insufficient or defficient for 25 (OH) vitamine D. Twelve patients (11.5%) were treated with hemodialysis, 30 patients(28.8%) with peritoneal dialysis and 7 patients (6.7%) underwent renal transplantation.A significant correlation between uric acid and 25 (OH) vitamine D level and CKD stages (P = 0.018) and between 25(OH) vitamine D and PTH level (P = 0.016) was found. Conclusions: The prevalance of CKD complications in children is high and assessment of patients in early stages for early treatment is advised. Introduction: There is an increased incidence of congenital and hereditary diseases causing chronic renal failure in the pediatric age-group. To determine the major causes, clinical expression, course, and outcomes of CKD in Albanian children we conducted a prospective study from January 2015 to January 2017 in the pediatric nephrology department at the UHC \"Mother Tereza\" in Tirana. Material and methods: This prospective study included all children (up to 15 years old) with the diagnosis of CRF who presented to the department of pediatric nephrology at the University Hospital Centre of Tirana during the period January 2015 to January 2017. The parameters studied included: gender, age, place of residence, age at the first complaint, age when the diagnosis of CRF was made, age at which the patient reached ESRD (if applicable), family history of similar kidney diseases, consanguinity, cause of CRF, associated malformations, co-morbidity {recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), hypertension and its response to therapy. Results: Forty-eight patients with varying degrees of renal impairment were involved in the analysis. A total of 27 children (56%) had obstructive nephropathy (ON) as the cause of chronic renal insufficiency and 21 children (44%) had non-obstructive nephropathy (Non-ON). Neurogenic bladder was the commonest cause of ON, seen in 13 patients (27%), nephrolithiasis was seen in 9 patients (19%), urethral stenosis in three (6%), Uretro-Pelvie Junction (UPJ) stenosis in one (2%), and posterior urethral valves in one case (2%). Conclusions: In our study obstructive nephropathy has been shown to be the most important cause of CKD. Whether this is due to a true higher prevalence of some causes of obstructive nephropathy or an insufficient sample size, can only be elucidated with further studies involving larger number of patients.",

CRRT provides the ability to control rate of reduction in osmolality by allowing the adjustment of dialysate solution and narrowing osmolar gap between the patient and dialysate. Further, \"inefficient\" solute clearance will less the rate of pH and osmolar changes over time. Material and methods: Case Report. Results: A 16-kg male child known case of Central Diabetes Insipidus presented unconscious and anuric with septic shock, anemic (Hb 4.8 g/l), AKI (BUN 427 mg/dl, Creatinine 7.6 mg/dl), severe hypernatremia (Na 216 mmol/l), and a PH of 7.0. Measured osmolality was 593 osmols/l. Patient was resuscitated, incubated and shifted to PICU. \"Inefficient\" CVVHD was begun at 8 mls/kg/h (in order to slowly improve the pH) with the use of PrismaSate\u00ae with an additional 80 meq/l of NaCl added to give total Na of 200 meq/L of PrismaSate\u00ae resulting in a dialysate bath of 550 osmols/l. Patient osmols were recalculated at 3 h increments and additional Na in the dialysate was decreased as needed. Based upon patient osmolar changes, additional sodium was adjusted until normal osmols were obtained (Figure) . Over 72 h the child had gradual drop of sodium till reaching 170 mmol/l then CVVHD was stopped and patient was shifted to medical treatment of hypernatremia. Over time patient had recovery of osmols, PH, renal and neurological function and continued on medical management.",

The patient presented with severe hyperosmolality and significant metabolic acidosis. A rapid correction of either of these conditions places him at risk for herniation and pontine demyelination. Utilizing a slow approach to osmolar and pH corrections is recommended in the literature to avoid these risky complications. Standard dialysis dosing of 35 mls/kg/h or 2000 mls/m2/h will result in significant solute clearance. By making the CVVHD prescription inefficient, one can then do a slow correction of the metabolic acidosis and with manipulation of the sodium bath of the dialysate one can narrow the osmolar gap between the patient and dialysate allowing for slow and continuous correction of the osmolality.",

To identify the causative mutation in these two siblings born of consanguineous union, we combined whole exome sequencing with homozygosity mapping. Results: The two twin siblings, the outcome of consanguineous marriage,were a boy and a girl, who presented with short stature, dysmorphic facial features, skeletal anomalies,and hypothyroidism. Furthermore, the boy had congenital heart disease, and he presented with nephrotic syndrome, that rapidly progressed to end stage kidney disease, while the girl only showed nephrotic range proteinuria without renal impairment. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in the gene COG1 that segregated with the affected status in this family. The mutated allele is likely deleterious as it has never been reported in healthy control databases (i.e. ExAC or gnomAD) and affects a well-conserved splice site. Mutations in the gene COG1 have been previously described in two unrelated families as monogenic causes of cerebrocostomandibular-like syndrome (MIM# 611209). However, renal involvement has not been described yet in patients with COG1 mutations. Conclusions: By whole exome and homozygosity mapping, we identified a rare genetic syndrome as the molecular disease cause in these siblings. We expand the phenotypic spectrum of COG1 mutations by describing renal involvement for the first time in this monogenic disease. Introduction: Severe Combined Immuno-Deficiency (SCID) is rarely associated with non-infectious/non-toxic acute kidney injury (AKI). Material and methods: We report herein a unique cause of AKI related to lymphoproliferation, revealing a SCID. Results: A previously healthy four month-old boy was admitted for AKI (creatinine 363 \u03bcM), hypertension, and edema, in the setting of a rhinovirus-positive bronchiolitis. He exhibited hyperechoic enlarged kidneys, nephrotic syndrome, anemia (8.8 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (87,000/ mm3), elevated LDH, 1.7% schistocytes, and reticulocytes 135,000/mm3. He was started on peritoneal dialysis. An atypical HUS was suspected and eculizumab was given. Despite rapid hematologic parameter normalization, renal function did not improved. Kidney biopsy, performed after the fifth dose of eculizumab, revealed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, inflammatory cells within the glomerular capillaries, with no evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Eculizumab was withdrawn, and three methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral prednisone were given without any improvement. Due to persistent lymphopenia and agammaglobulinemia, immune-deficiency was suspected and confirmed by immunophenotyping showing low T-cells (900 CD3/\u03bcl-93% \u03b3\u03b4-T-cells), B-cells (70/\u03bcl) and NK-cells (10/\u03bcl) compatible with the diagnosis of SCID. Surprisingly, \u03b3\u03b4-T cells were from maternal origin. Immunoscope showed oligoclonal profile of T-cells. Immunologic analyzes revealed an IL-2R common-\u03b3 chain defect causing X-linked SCID, and the diagnosis of materno-foetal graft-versus-host disease (MF-GVHD) caused by intrauterine materno-fetal transfusion was almost indisputable. He underwent successful geno-identical stem-cell transplantation at 7 months of age, followed by cadaveric kidney transplantation at the age of 3.4 years. Conclusions: Placenta barrier allows bidirectional passage of nucleated cells during pregnancy. While healthy infants reject these cells, profound immunodeficiency related to SCID allows persistence of maternal T-cells in newborns and peripheral expansion possibly driven by microorganisms. Maternal T-cell engraftment may be responsible for MF-GVHD mainly of skin, liver or digestive tract. We report herein a highly singular case of isolated nephritis related to presumed MF-GVHD.",

Material and methods: Clinical history, repeated clinical assessment,urine dipstick, microscopy, haematology, biochemical tests, histopathology and flow cytometry will be presented. Results: 16 year old boy with no significant past medical problems presented with history of passing cola coloured urine and abdominal pain. Urine dipstick showed haematuria and proteinuria but there was no erythrocyturia on microscopy. Blood picture was consistent with intravascular haemolysis with thrombocytopenia. There was rapid progression of the acute kidney injury with peak creatinine of 698 umol/l. Urine output was well preserved and there was no evidence of fluid overload. Kidney biopsy was performed in view of rapid deterioration of renal function. Autoimmune screen was negative. Histopathology was consistent with acute tubular injury. The striking feature was significant deposition of haemosiderin in the tubules with no evidence of glomerulonephritis. Flow cytometry confirmed the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. He was treated with eculizumab and responded well to treatment. Conclusions: Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria can present as rapidly progressive acute kidney injury. Careful interpretation of urine dipstick results in the context of absence of red cells on microscopy is an important diagnostic clue to diagnose haemoglobinuria. Treatment with eculizumab led to dramatic recovery. Introduction: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a major cause of renal failure in childhood. Most cases are caused by infection with Shigatoxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC). In 5-10% of cases, HUS is not preceded by the STEC infection and is considered atypical (aHUS). These cases are strongly associated with genetic defects leading to dysregulation of the complement system. Often aHUS is triggered by a non-STEC infection, however, genetic predisposition to such infections in aHUS has not yet been studied. Here we present thorough complement analysis of a 2 months old patient in whom aHUS episode coincided with Bordetella pertussis infection (whooping cough), Klebsiella oxytoca sepsis and Moraxella catarrhalis pneumonia. Material and methods: In vitro kinetics of complement activation products (C3bc and TCC) in serum were quantified using ELISA. DNA analysis was performed by Sanger sequencing. Recombinant vitronectin variants were produced in HEK293T cells, purified and used in hemolytic assay with sheep erythrocytes and purified C5b-6, C7, C8 and C9 complement proteins. Results: The in vitro complement activation kinetics were compared in patient serum and normal human serum (NHS). In patient serum C3 activation rate (expressed as generation of C3bc) was comparable to the rate in NHS, but the rate of TCC generation was slower. Genetic analysis of TCC components and TCC inhibitors revealed a rare heterozygous variant p.Arg229Cys in vitronectin. Prediction software (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) indicated this change as pathogenic. In vitro experiments using recombinant vitronectin variants have shown that this mutation enhances complement inhibition at TCC level. Conclusions: Our work indicates that not only genetic changes leading to uncontrolled complement activation but also these increasing vulnerability to infections contribute to aHUS. Conclusions: This cases picture the relevance of considering TMA in non-aHUS related diseases in which complement activation and endothelial damage may be trigger or consequence of complement activation. The relevance of complement gene polymorphisms as TMA predisposing condition is not yet well understood. Introduction: To describe a case who presented with atypical HUS and carries a homozygous CFHR1/CFHR3 deletions. She was found to have E coli 0119 k69 infection as well. We assume that E coli infection has triggered HUS in our case. Material and methods: Case report. Results: 1 year old girl presented with fever, non bloody diarrhea for 5 days. She has been anuric for couple of days before presenting to Hospital. Her initial investigations revealed acute renal failure with microangiopathic haemolysis. Platelets has been normal all the way through her illness. Her creatinine was 4.9 mg/dl (0.2-0.4), urea was 178 mg/dl (12-40), uric acid 15.4 mg/dl (2-6.2). high retic count at 3.13% (0.8-2). Normal electrolytes. Her parents are first degree cousins with no family history of renal diseases. LDH 5229 u/l (0-850). Blood film was consistent with HUS. She has received 1 dose of Eculizumab on her second day of admission, she has needed 6 haemodialysis sessions over 10 days as she has remained anuric for 10 days. She has also required blood transfusion. Her urine output has improved and she was discharged home after 3 weeks. She was not given any further doses of Eculizumab. Her initial total complement activity CH50 was low at presentation, however, her repeated level at 3 monthly basis has all been normal along with normalCFH level. Full genetic testing for atypical HUS has revealed that she carries a homozygous CFHR1/CFHR3 deletions. She has remained well with normal renal function, she was kept on low dose of ACE inhibitor due to low grade proteinuria. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first case in literature to have this combination. It also raises the question of the benefit of giving Eculizumab for life in this very rare case. After discussing with the family, we keep repeating CH50 as a marker of complement activity. Further studies needed to answer this question.",

            "text": "Jean Daniel Delbet, Iulia Stoica, Martin Auger, Alizee Michel, Feriel Fortas, Tim Ulinski Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Armand-trousseau Hospital, Ap-hp., University Paris 6, Upmc, Paris, France Introduction: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is exceptional in infants and is mostly linked to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura via ADAMTS13 gene mutations or to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, vitamin B12 disorders can also be associated with TMA. We report a case of TMA in a 7-month-old patient due to severe vitamin B12 deficiency. Material and methods: A 7-month-old boy presented to our emergency department with marked pallor and severe asthenia. Laboratory tests revealed a severe anemia (haemoglobin 30 g/L), thrombopenia (26 \u00d7 10 9 / ml) and 20% schistocytes. Initial investigations revealed also leukopenia, lymphopenia and megaloblastosis. Renal function was normal. Test for Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli was negative, there was no complement activation and ADAMTS13 activity was normal. Results: He was rapidly treated by fresh frozen plasma infusion and a high dose of vitamin B12 (5000 \u03bcg IM) at the time of admission, which allowed stopping the hemolysis within 12 h. Further metabolic investigations revealed a markedly elevated urinary methylmalonic acid (MMA) at 1245 \u03bcmol/mmol creatinine (< 10 \u03bcmol/mmol creatinine). Vitamin B12 level was very high (>1500 pmol/l) and plasma homocysteine very low (< 3 \u03bcmol). Unfortunately, these tests were performed after plasma infusion and B12 injection. Five days after the beginning of the vitamin B12 treatment, MMA level was normal (2 \u03bcmol/mmol). Moreover, the patient received exclusively breastfeeding; his mother has a severe vitamin B12 deficiency (< 50 pmol/l) and we noted a progressive lethargy and a poor weigh gain since he was 4 months old, suggesting a vitamin B12 deficiency rather than a disorder in the cobalamin metabolism. Conclusions: Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to severe TMA, even in infants. TMA is probably linked to hyperhomocysteinemia which is known to cause endothelial dysfunction. Introduction: Haemodialysis (HD) is a challenging treatment especially within the paediatric population. Though life saving, it is not without risk to the patient. Acute haemolysis associated with haemodialysis (HD) is rare, but potentially life threatening complication which requires prompt recognition by the clinician. We describe the first paediatric patient with this sequelae, a 13 year old girl with a background of HIV nephropathy, well established on HD post failure of her renal transplant. Material and methods: Approximately 90 min into a routine haemodialysis session via an AV fistula on a Gambro\u2122 AK200 highflux dialyser, the patient developed facial flushing, whole body rash, diffuse abdominal pain and significant hypertension (>190 mmHg). Haemodialysis was ceased and the patient treated for a presumed severe allergic reaction. She remained symptomatic for the next 24 h. Unfortunately her post dialysis bloods were unable to be analysed due to 'gross haemolysis'. The following morning, she recommenced haemodialysis on a Fresenius\u2122 5008 using a highflux dialyser. Post connection, a blood leak alarm was triggered. A second Fresenius\u2122 machine was prepared with a midflux dialyser. Again, a blood leak alarm was triggered. A third circuit was prepared on the Gambro\u2122AK200. Results: At this point we became strongly suspicious of a severe haemolytic reaction. Bloods revealed an acute drop in haemoglobin and haematocrit, grossly raised LDH and bilirubin and positive DAT. The patient tolerated the dialysis session but was not 'washed back'. Dialysate fluid was sent for chemical, bacterial toxin and copper analysis. Tubing and dialysers were returned to the respective companies for analysis. All results returned negative. By elimination, we deduce the most likely cause of haemolysis to be mechanical from the AV fistula in combination with intermittent HIV or EBV viraemia. The patient fully recovered within 72 h. Conclusions: Acute haemolysis is a rare but life threatening complication associated with haemodialysis. Prompt recognition and appropriate management is vital. Introduction: aHUS is a potentially life-threatening rare disease characterized by the triad:Coombs negative microangiopathic anemia,thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury(AKI).It can be sporadic or familial,and its often associated with genetic complement abnormalities/anti-complement factor-H antibodies. Material and methods: A 42-day-old male was referred to our center because of AKI,anemia,and thrombocytopenia.He was a term neonate(bw.2765 g)with an uneventful course of pregnancy.On the 2nd day of life,the patient experienced abdominal distension,oliguria,anemia and thrombocytopenia.An abdominal X-ray showed a necrotizing enterocolitis,but,despite the treatment he became hypotensive,with a remarkable increase in inflammatory markers,and finally reached a 30%fluid overload(3490 g).At 6 weeks of life,he was transferred to our unit.Anemia,thrombocytopenia and AKI suggested a thrombotic microangiopathy(TMA).The blood tests showed a consumption of haptoglobin,increase in LDH,schistocytes with negative Coombs test and a reduction of C3 with normal fibrinogen and coagulation tests.Potential causes of TMA were investigated and the overall picture was then suggestive for a complement-mediated aHUS.Due to the abdominal condition and the infectious risk,no complement-blocker was used. Results: TPE was then initiated using the CARPEDIEM machine and the Plasmart05 filter,with fresh frozen plasma(FFP)as replacement fluid and an exchange volume of 200 ml.The circuit was primed with 50 mL of 4%albumin.The blood pump rate was set at 10 mL/min,with an exchange rate of 1 mL/min and a total session time of 3.5 h.He received 5 consecutive daily sessions of TPE,without any clinical/technical problem.The first 2 sessions of TPE were followed by a CVVH.Afterwards,an increase in urinary output was observed,with restoration of normal fluid status,renal function and blood counts.At 2 months of age,after complete resolution of the abdominal and infectious condition,Eculizumab was started.Molecular analysis resulted as negative,but an increase in the amount of C5b9 on human microvascular endothelial cells was found during the acute phase. Conclusions: Few reports have described the experience of using Eculizumab,and still less TPE in neonates,with aHUS.We would like to underline the efficacy of TPE with CARPEDIEM when Eculizumab is contraindicated. Introduction: Both nephrotic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rare diseases in childhood. In most children the cause of nephrotic syndrome is minimal change nephropathy, however nephrotic syndrome is also a recognized manifestation of neoplastic diseases. Nephrotic syndrome associated with malignancy can appear prior to onset, concurrently, or after diagnosis of malignancy. Although rare, the association of nephrotic syndrome and AML has been reported previously. In this report, we describe a patient with a history of AML who developed nephrotic syndrome. Material and methods: A 5-year-old boy presented at our hospital with edema, abdominal distension and persistent proteinuria. He had a history of AML at 13 months of age, for which he was successfully treated with chemotherapy conform the Dutch-Belgian pediatric AML protocol and so far remained in complete remission. Initial laboratory evaluation in combination with edema showed the triad of nephrotic syndrome. In order to exclude recurrence of AML or other malignancies an invasive and extensive work-up was done prior to the start of nephrotic syndrome treatment to avoid masking malignancy and thereby a delay in final diagnosis. Results: Complete blood count and white blood cell differential showed no abnormalities. Bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture indicated no signs of AML recurrence. PET-CT scan excluded other malignant causes. Renal biopsy was consistent with minimal change nephropathy. After excluding malignancy as secondary cause of nephrotic syndrome, standard oral prednisolone treatment was started and the patient went into remission within 3 weeks. At follow-up 1.5 years later, our patient is doing well, has remained in remission and shows no signs of recurrence of AML. Conclusions: We report a child with two unrelated rare diseases in childhood. It is important to rule out various causes of nephrotic syndrome, especially in children with a history of malignancy, but it may turn out to be an idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.",

            "text": "Rowena Lalji, Kate Sinnott, Daljit Hothi Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children, UK Introduction: Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome is a potentially life threatening complication usually associated with the commencement of haemodialysis (HD). However, paediatric patients and those with preexisting CNS lesions remain at risk. We report the case of a dialysis dependent ten year old girl with a background of Spina Bifida and VP shunt who experienced headaches and generalized tonic-clonic seizures when dialysing using a conventional GambroTM AK200 dialysis machine. Material and methods: The patient generally experienced symptoms after >3 h of dialysis. Seizures required rescue therapy and as a result, she was commenced on regular anticonvulsant medication before each HD session. Prior to starting dialysis, there was no history of headaches or seizures. We propose that this patient's symptoms were a result of disequilibrium syndrome. Various alterations to the patient's HD regimen to reduce the risk of disequilibrium were employed including shorter, more frequent dialysis sessions, cooling on the machine, a reduction in blood flow rate (and thus reduced rate of clearance of uraemic toxins including urea) as well as using smaller dialysers. Eventually the patient's selfreported and witnessed symptoms were successfully minimised by moving to the NxstageTM system with equitable clearance. The patient continued on NxstageTM HD for seven months until she was successfully transplanted. Managing intra-dialytic and post dialysis symptoms was vital in our patient for whom peritoneal dialysis would have likely failed for a multitude of reasons. Results: We speculate that a combination of cooling and a slower rate of purification with the NxStage dialysis system was responsible for the improved tolerance to dialysis treatments compared with the GambroTM dialysis system. Thus remained true when the dialyser size was increased to improve the total treatment single pool Kt/V. Conclusions: HD using the NxstageTM dialysis system appears to improve the tolerance to dialysis treatments in patients prone to intradialytic symptoms and dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Introduction: Objectives. To characterize hypernatremia in a suspicion of Rapid onset Obesity with Hypothalamic dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic dysregulation, Neuro-Endocrine Tumors (ROHHAD-NET) syndrome and to suggest a treatment. Material and methods: We describe the case of a 6 year-old obese boy (60 kg, 135 cm) with a suspicion of ROHHAD-NET syndrome and a severe and unexplained hypernatremia. Results: At admission, our patient presented with hypernatremia (154 mmol/L), a plasmatic hyperosmolarity of 332 mosmol/L and a hypotonic polyuria (207 mosmol/l) which was suspicious for diabetes insipidus (DI). After a water deprivation test, natremia increased to 160 mmol/l with a plasmatic osmolarity of 346 mosmol/L and, surprisingly, a urinary osmolarity of 535 mosmol/L, suggesting remaining endogenous vasopressin secretion. Plasmatic vasopressin values (1.47 pg/ ml -1.76 pg/ml) were low and inappropriate for natremia which ranged between 152 and 160 mmol/L, strengthening the diagnosis of partial central DI. The absence of thirst despite severe hypernatremia suggests a specific type of DI known as adipsic DI. The hypothalamic dysfunction has been described in ROHHAD-NET syndrome. Our patient seems to have characteristics of both entities. Desmopressin treatment resulted in a decrease of natremia to 146 mmol/L and urinary osmolarity increased to 822 mosmol/L. No genetic mutations in genes linked to monogenic obesity and pituitary deficiency including PCSK1 were identified. Conclusions: Hypernatremia seems to be a component of ROHHAD-NET syndrome, even if the pathophysiological mechanism has not yet been identified. We report the case of a boy with a condition compatible with ROHHAD-NET syndrome and central partial adipsic DI. Oral desmopressin treatment and free water access improve natremia and potential neurologic damage. Careful attention should be paid concerning the narrow gap between benefits and potential risks of desmopressin treatment and free water intake in such conditions. Introduction: Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a genetically heterogeneous glomerulopathy progressed to end-stage of renal disease (ESRD) during childhood or adolescence. X-linked ichthyosis is a rare inherited disorder due to steroid sulfatase deficiency (MIM #308100). Very few cases of SRNS associated with X-linked recessive ichthyosis were described, but molecular genetic basis of SRNS was not studied yet. Material and methods: We report on a 11-year-old boy presenting with SRNS since age of 7 years with an underlying ichthyotic skin since birth. Results: The boy with SRNS and early-onset ichthyosis was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. On admission he had proteinuria (1.2 g/ d), hypoalbuminemia (27 g/L) without oedema, normal blood pressure (110/60 mmHg) and kidney function (eGFR 176.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). The boy had also severe hyperkeratosis. Renal ultrasound showed enlarged kidneys with bilateral diffuse hyperechogenicity of parenchyma. Kidney histopathology revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Diffuse foot process effacement in podocytes was described by electron microscopy. Targeted nextgeneration sequencing covering 68 genes implicated in SRNS identified known heterozygous compound mutations c.890C > T (p.Ala297Val, rs199506378) in exon 8 and c.686G > A (p.Arg229Gln, rs61747728) in exon 5 in the NPHS2 gene, associated with of autosomal recessive SRNS, type 2 (MIM #600995). Copy number variation analysis revealed novel hemizygousdeletion in the STS gene on chromosome Xp22.31 (6527321-8,088,112)\u00d70 (Z-score < \u22123.2), confirming the diagnosis of X-linked recessive ichthyosis (MIM #308100). Therapy with ACE inhibitors was administered to the patient to prevent potential progression to ESRD. After 2 years of follow-up the boy had the same extent of proteinuria (1.5 g/d), and his renal function remains unimpaired (eGFR 123.5 ml/ min/1.73 m 2 ). Conclusions: We presented the case of NPHS2-associated SRNS in a boy with steroid sulfatase deficiency-X-linked ichthyosis caused by STS mutation. Digenic inheritance of NPHS2 and STS mutations in this case might have modifier effects with unclear molecular pathogenicity causing an uncommon clinical phenotype.",

            "text": "Introduction: A 12-year-old boy presented at the pediatric department with persistent non bilious vomiting since 3 days and anuria. Material and methods: There was no diarrhea nor other symptoms. His medical history was negative besides episodes of vomiting during periods of stress from the age of 7 years. At physical examination moderate dehydration was seen. Results: His laboratory results showed metabolic alkalosis and elevated serum creatinine (1.7 mg/dl) and BUN (123 mg/dl) with hyperphosphataemia and hyperparathyroidism. Urinalysis was normal. Ultrasound showed enlarged kidneys with increased cortical echogenicity. After IV rehydration he recovered with normalization of diuresis and cessation of vomiting. Hyperphospataemia and hyperparathyroidism together typically are more associated with CKD than AKI and the ultrasound image was atypical for acute tubular necrosis. A renal biopsy was performed which showed normal glomeruli but tubules filled with amorphous material consistent with the microscopic presentation of Hyperoxaluria. Conclusions: He was suspected of primary Hyperoxaluria and treatment was commenced. Genetic testing for primary Hyperoxaluria was negative. We noticed that his growth chart showed stunted growth from the age of 9 years and he confirmed to having episodes of vomiting almost every night for the past 2 years. A hypotonic duodenography showed subobstruction at the duodeno-jejunal junction which was confirmed at gastroscopy where a complete torsion of the distal duodenum and stomach traction was seen. On laparascopy a malrotation with chronic volvulus without vascular compromise were seen and corrected. Hyperoxaluria was thought to be secondary to the chronic intermittent intestinal obstruction with malabsorption. Enteric hyperoxaluria is responsible for 5% of cases of hyperoxaluria and is seen secondary to (fat) malabsorption with increased enteric oxalate absorption. It is usually secondary to conditions such as intestinal surgery, bacterial overgrowth syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. After surgery his growth improved with cessation of vomiting and serum creatinine settling around 0.9 mg/dl (CKD stage 2). Introduction: Arterial hypertension due to renal artery stenosis or midaortic syndrome is a common finding in patients with Neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 (20%). Arterial stiffness is used to describe the elasticity of the arteries, it reflects the procedure of aging on the vascular system and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, chronic renal disease and arterial hypertension. It can be assessed non-invasively through the determination of the carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). The purpose of this case is to describe the correlation between arterial stiffness and arterial hypertension as documented with office Blood Pressure (BP) levels and ambulatory BP levels. Material and methods: We report a case of refractory hypertension accompanied with increased arterial stiffness in a 4 year-old girl with NF type 1 and mid-aortic syndrome. She presented initially with office BP levels below the 90th percentile but with a routine ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) with a nondipping profile. The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Office BP presented a decrease at 4 months after PTA. In constrast, ambulatory BP levels increased and were accompanied by an increased in cf.-PWV. After 8 months renal function was improved, the hypertention persisted, but there was a significant reduction of ambulatory BP levels, which agrees with the reduction in cf.-PWV values, despite sustained office BP elevation. Results: Masked hypertension may be present and a nondipping profile may enable the early diagnosis of arterial hypertension. There seems to be a superiority of ABPM in the assessment and follow up of hypertension and a better correlation to arterial stiffness. Introduction: Renal dysfunction in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipient traditionally has been attributed to use of nephrotoxic drug. BK-virus nephritis (BKVN) can remain undiagnosed in these patients due to lack of screening for BK-infection and to its nonspecific clinical picture. Material and methods: The cases of BKVN after HSCT were reviwed. Results: Pt 1. Six-year-old girl with multilinear myelodysplasia presented with the rising of serum creatinine (from 58 to 120 \u03bcmol/l) on 13 mo after HSCT. One month before renal dysfunction she had pulmonitis of unknown etiology. The girl had stem cell transplant's hypofunction and secondary immunodeficiency and was treating with Methotrexate (0.6 mg/kg/week), Cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m 2 /week) because of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Urinalysis and renal US were normal. BK-virus PCR analysis revealed 6.7 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml in urine. A renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial injuary with many tubular intranuclear inclusions and positive immunostainig for SV-40. Immunosuppression was discontinued, therapy with IVIG 1 g/kg, Cidofovir 0.5 mg/kg/week, Leflunomide 10 mg/day was started. Despite BK eradication there was no improvement in renal function after 2 mo of treatment. To date she has stable renal insufficiency: Cr s = 128 \u03bcmol/l, eGFR =26 ml/min. Pt 2. Eight months after HSCT due to refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ten-year-old boy had an episode of encephalitis with extrapontial myelinosis (etiology?) and serum creatinine level increasing (from 38 to 180 \u03bcmol/l). He received Prednisone 2 mg/kg/day and Prograf 0,015 mg/kg/day because of GVHD. Urine BK-virus titer was 2 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml. A renal biopsy revealed tubulointerstitial nephritis with positive immunostainig for SV-40. Immunosuppression was discontinued, therapy with IVIG 1 g/kg, Leflunomide 10 mg/day, Ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg/day was started. During 2 years of observation the boy had stable renal dysfunction: eGFR =60 ml/min. Pt 3. The 22-year boy with acute myeloblastic leukemia (M1/M2) presented with renal impairment: Cr s rose from 54 to 202 \u03bcmol/l 12 months after of HSCT. He was on treatment with Prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day, CyclosporineA 200 mg/day and Bortezomib (Velcade) 0.4 mg/kg/week due to skin form of GVHD. The boy had secondary immunodeficiency and recurrent CMV-virus infection. The renal dysfunction was preceded by hemorrhagic cystitis. Urine BK-virus titer was 12 \u00d7 10 3 copies/ml, the renal biopsy confirmed BKVN. Therapy with IVIG 1 g/kg, Cidofovir 0.5 mg/kg/week, Leflunomide 10 mg/day and Ciprofloxacin 250 mg/ day was started. There was no recovery of renal function; the boy had stable eGFR about 30-35 ml/min during 2 years of observation. Conclusions: We suppose that the actual incidence of BKVN after HSCT is much higher than what is commonly thought. Our clinical cases demonstrate that BK-virus screening and renal biopsy would be performed in all non-renal transplant and immunosuppressed patients with unexplained rising of serum creatinine. These patients may benefit from early detection and treatment of BKVN and modification of immunosuppressive therapy. Introduction: Urethral duplication in girls is a very rare congenital pathology. Successful surgical reconstructive treatment heavily depends on appropriate clinical examination and evaluation of anatomy. Material and methods: We describe a case of successful treatment of type II urethral duplication according to Stephens in a 2.5-year-old girl. Results: Several fever episodes in infancy, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) since the age of 1 year. Daytime incontinence from 2 years, following complete disability to control urination. A spherical formation in the region of the labia, collapsing after outflow of urine. Referred to the The Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno klinikos at 2.5 years Examination: height -25 \u2030, weight -3 \u2030, deep eye sockets, wide nasal bridge, broad shoulders, large abdominal girth, hypertrophic clitoris. XX karyotype, normal kidney function. UTI (Enteroccocus faecalis) was diagnosed. Kidney ultrasonography: bilateral ureterohydronehrosis, megacystis. Post void residual -115 mL. MAG-3: bilateral obstructive curves with slow excretion after furosemide infusion (accumulation of radioisotope media in diluted ureters). Right kidney function -71% of total kidney function, left kidney -29%. Cystograms -left kidney V\u00b0VUR. Gynecologist, endocrinologist: clitoral hypertrophy. Cystoscopy: large trabeculated urinary bladder, ureter foramina not open, two urethrae -one opening into the clitoris, the other opening normally into the perineum. Surgery was performed: 0.5-cm fragment of urethra removed in the area of the clitoris, clitoroplasty, Foley catheter inserted. Microscopy analysis of the segment: visible cavernous bodies making up the clitoris, urethra lined with urethral epithelium. The Foley catheter was removed after 4 days, urinary bladder catheterization every 3 h due to valvelike bladder. The patient was no longer incontinent, ultrasonography revealed subsiding urostasis. Conclusions: Urethral duplication is a rare pathology in girls, requiring thorough physical examination and testing. Introduction: Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits (GFND) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant disease with age-related penetrance, characterized by proteinuria, microscopiche ematuria, hypertension and massive fibronectin deposits in the mesangiumand subendothelial space, leading to end-stage renal failure. It usually develops in adulthood. Only two cases with childhood onset have been described in literature so far. Material and methods: We report the case of a two year-old male child who presented with mild proteinuria, normal kidney function and mild increase of creatine kinase and lactated hydrogenase plasmatic levels. The physical and neurological examination showed short stature, rhizomelia and speech delay. Results: Given the presence of persistent proteinuria, a targeted resequencing analysis of 27 genes related to nephrotic syndrome was performed and a novel missense variant, c.341G > T (p.Arg114Leu) in the FN1 gene, associated with GFND, was found. The pathogenicity of this variant is supported by its absence in any public database and in silico predictions with a DANN Score of 0.9987 (Varsome). However, a kidney biopsy is still required to confirm the diagnosis by showing the presence of fibronectin deposits. Conclusions: GFND should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent proteinuria in pediatrics age, even if it is rarely described in childhood. Accordingly, molecular analysis of FN1 gene should be included in the genetic work-up of persistent proteinuria.",

            "text": "Introduction: Renal tubuler disorders are a group of diseases that can occur with different clinical findings.Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis is a rare autosomal recessive renal disease characterized by tubular disorders. It is caused by mutations in the tight junction structural proteins claudin-16 or claudin-19, which are encoded by the CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes, respectively. Patients exhibit excessive wasting of calcium and magnesium, nephrocalcinosis, chronic kidney disease, and early progression to end-stage renal failure during infancy. Material and methods: A six year-old boy presented with fever and abdominal pain. In his past medical history, he had recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones and chronic renal failure. There was no consaguinity between his mother and father. There were a large number of kidney stones in his family. Increased serum creatinine and decreased magnesium levels were detected in blood biochemistry.The urinal ultrasonography showed diffuse medullary nephrocalcinosis and multiple stones in both kidneys and ureter. The right ureteral stone causing complete obstruction was removed. Hypercalciuria, hypermagnesuria, and hypocitraturia were detected in his urinary examinations. Eye examination was normal. Results: C113Y mutation was detected in the CLDN-16 gene analysis sent by FHNCC. Supportive treatments and potassium citrate was started. Conclusions: Serum and urine magnesium examinations must be performed in children who are admitted with nephrocalcinosis and / or nephrolithiasis in childhood. In chronic renal diseases with unknown etiology, which are associated with nephrocalcinosis and nephrolitiasis, FHNCC should come to mind. Introduction: Multi-organ involvement is the hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinically significant hepatic disease is generally regarded as unusual in SLE, but studies showed that hepatic disease may be more common in SLE that was initially thought. Hepatic disease is not a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, but subclinical liver involvement is common. We aimed to determine if whether to classify our patient as having a primary liver disease with associated autoimmune features or having liver disease as a manifestation of SLE. Material and methods: We investigated a 14 years old boy who presented with one-year history of elevated serum aminotransferase and complaints of daily fever in the last month, polyarthralgia, swelling of the right knee, hepatosplenomegaly. Family history was negative for autoimmune or inherited liver disease, including Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and SLE. Results: SLE was confirmed by 4 clinical and 3 immunological criteria (according to SLICC Classification Criteria). Liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis with discreet inflammatory activity, no fibrosis, no interface hepatitis, no fatty infiltration, so no specific elements were identified. Renal biopsy revealed class IIIC kidney disease. Conclusions: The difference between the hepatic involvement in SLE and AIH has not been clearly defined due to similarities in the clinical and biochemical features. Lupus hepatitis is a SLE-related liver dysfunction and it has been described as hypertransaminasemia owing to the fluctuations in the levels of alanine transaminase that are consistent with the activity of SLE. We consider that our patient has SLE and lupus hepatitis. Children with liver dysfunction and SLE should be investigated for Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) as these two entities can occur together and their complications are different. AIH may lead to end-stage liver disease, while SLE may result in end-stage renal disease. Liver biopsy might be necessary to establish the diagnostic in SLE patients with persistent increase of liver enzymes. Introduction: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a multisystem disorder due to a ciliopathy with autosomal recessive inheritance. The cardinal features are pigmentary retinopathy, central obesity, postaxial polydactyly, mental retardation, hypogonadism and renal abnormalities.Renal involvement with progressive deterioration in renal function was recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Different renal histological pictures were reported in BBS including tubulo-interstitial lesions, focal segmental glomerulo-sclerosis and renal cysts. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of collapsing glomerulopathy with progressive deterioration in renal function in a child with BBS. Material and methods: A 9 year old girl with BBS presented with nephrotic range proteinuria and advanced chronic kidney disease. Her serum creatinine was 169 \u03bcmol/l (serum creatinine value recorded 6 months back was 79 \u03bcmol/l) giving estimated glomerular filtration rate of 23mls/min/1.73m 2 and urine protein/creatinine ratio was 467 mg/ mmol. Serum albumin was 27 g/l and serum cholesterol was high.Examination revealed minimal oedema with elevated blood pressure (146/102 mmHg). USS revealed normal renal sizes with markedly increased cortical echogenicity with loss of cortico-medullary demarcation. Her renal biopsy showed only 1/23 of viable glomeruli and 22/23 glomeruli with tuft collapse and peri-glomerular fibrosis. She was treated with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Results: After 6 months of treatment her urine protein/creatinine ratio has reduced to 87 mg/mmol. Last recorded blood pressure was 112/ 76 mmHg. But serum creatinine has increased to 184 \u03bcmol/l. Conclusions: Children with BBS are at higher risk of renal impairment. They can present with nephrotic range proteinuria and ACE inhibitors are effective in decelerating the progression. Collapsing glomerulopathy is a rare histological sub type in BBS which could be associated with adverse prognosis. Introduction: Primary lymphatic dysplasia (PLD) is a hereditary developmental abnormality of the lymphatic system, resulting in primary lymphedema. Some of the patients have generalized edema and hydrops fetalis. We report a case of a female patient with PLD with systemic involvement presented as nephrotic syndrome. Material and methods: Results: A three months old girl referred with generalized edema with severe abdominal distension and hypoalbuminemia. She was born to consanguineous parents at 34 weeks of gestation due to hydrops fetalis diagnosed at 3rd trimester. The patient was treated in neonatal intensive care unit for two months because of respiratory distress and sepsis. Physical examination showed abdominal distension due to ascites fluid, generalized edema including severe genital edema. Laboratory investigation revealed: serum albumin: 2.9 mg/dl, 24 h urine protein: 15 mg/m 2 /h. Renal functions, serum electrolytes, complement 3 and antinuclear antibody were normal. Metabolic screening tests and viral serology including TORCH, hepatitis B and C virus were negative, ascites fluid was serous. During the follow-up, serum albumin level of the patient was remained between 2.6-2.9 g/dl and she did not need regular albumin infusion. Based on clinical and laboratory findings, lymphatic edema was considered in differential diagnosis. Lymphoscintigraphy confirmed diagnosis and revealed primary lymphatic dysplasia. Figure 1 . Lymphoscintigraphy of the patients Conclusions: Primary lymphatic dysplasia should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of the patients presented as nephrotic syndrome without massive proteinuria and mild, stabile hypoalbuminemia. Generalized edema and hydrops fetalis may develop in these patients. Lymphoscintigraphy is widely considered the main investigative tool for establishing the diagnosis of PLD. Introduction: NC in children recognizes many causes, both endogenous and exogenous /iatrogenic nature (eg. Vit D intoxication, diuretics). Among the endogenous early onset causes there are inborn errors of metabolism including primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Material and methods: We describe the case of a two months and half infant with bilateral renal medullary hyperechogenicity we found occasionally during hips ultrasonography. Results: At the beginning, the patient showed good clinical conditions. The most common causes of nephrocalcinosis, including tubulopathy were excluded since we found good renal function, negative inflammatory markers, normal electrolytes, vitamin D and PTH. Urinary electrolytesmetabolites, proteinuria and amminoaciduria were normal too. Renal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of renal medullary hyperechogenicity. Computed tomography angiography showed multiple calicealhyperdense images. In order to find inborn errors of metabolism we dosed urinary organic acids which documented an increased level of oxalic acid and glycerine. In the suspect of type 2 PH, molecular analysis was carried out and confirmed the diagnosis. A hydropinic therapy was started continuing follow-up. Subsequent ultrasound evaluations documented the evolution towards a clear picture of nephrolithiasis. Actually the patient presents normal kidney function with regular height-weight growth. Conclusions: Type 2 PH is an extremely rare cause of nephrocalcinosis not so different from type 1; for that reason molecular analysis assumes a discriminating role. The importance of an early diagnosis derives from the possibility to start an early hemodialysis treatment that, in some cases, may prevent the rapid evolution of the pathology towards the widespread nephrolithiasis characterized by terminal renal insufficiency, systemic oxalosis and multiorgan damage. Introduction: Adrenal hemorrhage is a rare clinical entity in the neonatal period, with an incidence of 1.7-2.1 / 1000 births. It is more often diagnosed on the right side whilst bilateral hemorrhage occurs in 10-15% of cases. Material and methods: Clinical presentation shows a wide range of symptoms, from the signs of adrenal insufficiency to asymptomatic course of illness with incidental finding of changes on tests. Neonatal jaundice due to hemolysis of hemorrhagic content often is an accompanying sign. We present a male neonate born at term, with the early neonatal jaundice of unknown cause and without evidence of perinatal infection. Ultrasound of the urinary tract was made and it was seen a hypoechogenic formation in the upper poles of both kidneys, confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen. Results: Clinical and laboratory test results showed no signs of adrenal insufficiency. There was no confirmation of embryonic tumor or neuroblastoma. Conclusions: Ultrasound of the urinary tract, as an available and noninvasive test, has its place in the treatment of early neonatal jaundice of unknown cause. With ultrasound monitoring of regression of formation a further invasive treatment and unnecessary laparotomy can be avoided. Introduction: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be triggered by a viral infection or another immunologic mechanism. The management and study of this pathology might reveal an association with several underlying systemic diseases. Material and methods: NA. Results: A previously healthy, nine-year old boy, son of a nonconsanguineous healthy couple, presented to the emergency department with intermittent fever over the course of seven days, petechial rash and bruises on his legs. The platelet count was 63,000/\u03bcL, with normal hemoglobin and leucocyte count. Investigation showed frankly positive direct antiglobulin test, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), lupus anticoagulant test, anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta2-glycoprotein-I. These tests continued to be positive 12 weeks after the presentation. During follow-up, he continued to present sporadic but spontaneously resolving petechial rash. Four years after presentation, he was found to have cutaneous vasculitis on his hand and a positive anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody, thus meeting enough criteria for the diagnosis of systemic lupus eritematosus (SLE) with antiphospholipid syndrome. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine (6 mg/kg/day) and aspirin was initiated. Two years after SLE diagnosis, he was started on oral prednisone due to the finding of active urinalysis and elevated serum creatinine (1.07 mg/dL). These parameters normalized and no renal flare occurred since then. Renal biopsy revealed mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis (class II). Recently on ophthalmologic examination a retinopathy in bull's eye was observed and hydroxychloroquine was timely interrupted. Conclusions: In 15% of cases, ITP might be the first manifestation of SLE, antedating this diagnosis. The authors emphasize the importance of monitoring closely children with positive ANA and ITP, in order to allow the early identification of SLE manifestations. Bull's eye retinopathy is rare and its risk increases with high cumulative dosis of hydroxychloroquine. Nonetheless, in this patient case, it is not totally clear if it represents another manifestation of SLE rather than an iatrogenic consequence.",

The condition may be asymptomatic or result in urinary tract infection (UTI), postvoid dripping or obstruction. Although the etiology is not clear, vulvar irritation, poor hygiene or excessive cleaning may be responsible. Familial labial adhesion has not yet been reported in the literature. Material and methods: Case report: We present a three year old girl evaluated for recurrent UTIs and found to have labial fusion that did not disappear with topical estrogen. Surgical separation was needed after which UTIs stopped. Her 16 months old sister also had labial fusion without any symptoms that disappeared with topical estrogen. We do not know if this is a coincidence or not. Results: Discussion: Maternal estrogen insufficiency was previously believed to cause neonatal labial adhesions which disappear in puberty. However estrogen levels of children with and without labial adhesions were compared in a study demonstrating no difference, so hypoestrogenic theory is no longer accepted. Familial labial adhesion cannot be thought as an analogous of androgen insensitivity syndrome seen in familial hipospadias. As labial adhesions disappear with intense estrogen treatment, it may be speculated that there may be estrogen insufficiency or estrogen insensitivity in local tissues of these children. Androgen insensitivity is defined for testosterone but there is not a study concerning estrogen. Association of labial adhesion and familial phimosis that is not physiological is also not defined in literature too. As the presented sisters do not have a brother, we are not able to query about this. The mother of these children may had similar complaints in childhood but this is not stated by her. As a result, labial adhesion in two sisters has brought in mind a possible familial predisposition of the condition. Introduction: Renal function-based carboplatin dosing results in more consistent drug exposure than flat dosing. We aimed to validate the Newell dosing equation using estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and study which renal function marker most accurately predicts carboplatin clearance in children. Material and methods: In 30 children with a wide spectrum of solid tumours, 78 carboplatin clearance values were obtained from individual fits using NONMEM. Observed carboplatin clearance was compared with predicted clearance calculated according to the Newell dosing equation using three different GFR estimates, one creatinine-based (eGFR-Schwartz), one cystatin C-based (eGFR-CKiD1) and one based on creatinine and cystatin C (eGFR-CKiD2). Bias and precision of the predictions was examined. Results: Both CKiD equations were accurate with a bias of 1.7 (95% CI -1.7 to 5.1) and \u22123.3 (95% CI -7.0 to 0.35) ml/min for respectively eGFR-CKiD1 and CKiD2, whereas the bias of eGFR-Schwartz significantly differed from zero (\u221216.2; 95% CI -21.5 to \u221210.9 mL/min). eGFR-CKiD1 gave the lowest bias and imprecision, the other two eGFR equations showed overprediction of carboplatin clearance as reflected by negative bias and higher mean prediction error values. The proportion of variance in observed clearance that can be explained by the predicted clearance was lowest for Schwartz (R 2 = 0.58), the explained variance was 0.65 for both CKiD equations.",

Introduction: Nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerular disorder in childhood. Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for nephrotic syndrome in children as over 80-90% of patients achieves complete remission after prednisolone treatment. Yet, over 80% experience one or more relapses, necessitating repeated courses of corticosteroid therapy. This exposes patients to severe side effects and long term complications. No randomized controlled trials are available to determine the optimal corticosteroid treatment of an infrequent relapse of nephrotic syndrome. Recent studies show that treatment schedules for the first episode can safely be reduced. The hypothesis of the REducing STEroids in Relapsing Nephrotic syndrome (RESTERN) study is that a 4-week reduction of alternate day steroids is effective and safe, reduces steroid exposure by 35% on average, and is therefore preferable. Material and methods: The RESTERN study is a nation-wide, doubleblind, randomized, placebo controlled, noninferiority intervention study. Children aged 1-18 years with a relapse of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (n = 144) are randomly assigned to either the current standard therapy in the Netherlands (prednisolone daily until remission, than 6 weeks on alternate days) or a reduced prednisolone schedule (prednisolone daily until remission, than 2 weeks on alternate days, followed by 4 weeks of placebo on alternate days). Results: The primary endpoint of the RESTERN study is the time to the first relapse. The secondary end points are the number of relapses, progression to frequent relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome and the cumulative dosage of prednisolone during the study period of 48 months follow-up.",

Introduction: To compare kidney lengths, birth lengths and weights of healthy full-termed twins with singleton infants. Material and methods: Utrasonographic measurements of kidney lengths were performed on 1073 on time-born singleton infants (2146 healthy kidneys, 549 boys, 524 girls) (group A) and 87 twin infants (174 healthy kidneys, 46 boys, 41 girls) (TIG). Birth lengths and weights were measured in 309 singleton infants (167 boys, 142 girls) (group B) and in TIG and compared. Birth lengths were analyzed by T-test, while birth weights by Mann-Whitney U test. The average, minimum and maximum values (5% and 95% CI) and standard deviations were calculated by statistical program SPSS 16. Results: 4 different nomograms of kidney lengths in singletons and twins were presented according to the gender and side. Left and right kidneys were significantly longer in males than in females (p < 0.05) between the 2nd-6th months of life, but not between 7th-12th months of life (p > 0.05). Left kidneys were significantly longer than right kidneys in both sexes in the first year of life (p < 0.05). No significant difference in the kidney length existed between TIG and group A. Arithmetic mean birth length was 2 cm higher in males from group B than in TIG (t = 6.4; p\u02c20,001), while it was 2.4 cm higher in females in group B than in TIG (t = 6.4; p\u02c20,001). Median birth weight was 620 g higher in males from group B than in TIG (z = 6.9; p\u02c20,001), while it was 800 g higher in females from group B than in TIG (z = 7.3; p\u02c20,001). Conclusions: We present four nomograms of kidney size in the first year of life. Although the birth lengths and weights were significantly lower in twins than in singletons, kidney lengths were equal in both groups. Therefore, the same nomograms are useful for measurements of kidney length in both groups. Introduction: Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein Vaskulitis (HSV) is a small vessel vasculitis which is seen common in pediatric population.The incidence is 14-18 / 100.000 children per year. Renal involvement is the determinant factor in prognosis. Because it is known that neurominidase 1 (NEU1) gene, which is cellular lysosomal sialidase and responsible for the sialization of IgA molecule and the defects in the sialization steps cause IgA accumulation in the vascular wall, we investigated expression of NEU1 gene in our HSV-diagnosed patients and tried to clarify its role in the disease formation. Material and methods: Fifty patients with HSV renal involvement and 50 healthy control groups were included in this study. Patients were evaluated for demographics and NEU1 gene mutation. NEU1 gene analysis was performed by the PCR method. Results: Forty-nine comma 4 % of the patients were male and 50.6% were female. Seventy comma one percents' had renal involvement at different grades. The average age of the patients was 10.21 (\u00b1 3.95). The 40 % of control group was male and 60% was female. The average age of the control group was 11.24 (\u00b1 4.16). At the time of application, 41.4% of the patients had abdominal pain, 95.4% had rash, 2.3% had edema and 31% had arthritis / arthralgia. Patients were most frequently diagnosed during the autumn season with %31. Patients' 21.8% have passed the URI in the last two weeks. Presence of hypertension at the time of diagnosis was 6.9%. Kidney involvement was detected in 60.9% of patients, GIS involvement in 16.1% and scrotal involvement in 1 person. None of the patients had any abnormality in renal function tests and coagulation tests. Significant proteinuria was present in 66.7% of the patients and hematuria was detected in 73.6% of the patients. Skin biopsy was performed and all of the patients were found compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Renal biopsy was performed eleven patients and all of them were detected compatible with IgA nephropathy. When the biochemical laboratory parameters was evaluated between the patients groups and control group, no significant difference was found. The urine findings of the patients with renal involvement was significantly different from those without renal involvement (p < 0.001). No mutations were detected in the NEU1 gene in all HSV kidney-affected patients and the control group. Conclusions: Neu1 gene mutation was not detected in Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein vasculitis patients with renal involvement. In this study, there was no link between HSV kidney involvement and the NEU1 gene, which is a lysosomal sialidase and involved in the sialization of IgA. Introduction: Fluid overload, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are common in children on dialysis. In adults, HDF is shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality, but causes for this are not clear and data in children are scarce. Material and methods: We analysed the baseline data in prevalent dialysis patients from the HDF vs HD (3H) study to assess fluid status, BP and cardiovascular measures on HD and HDF.",

            "text": "Results: Of the 179 children (from 28 centres in 10 European countries) in the HDF vs HD study 69 were prevalent dialysis patients, 35 on HD and 34 on HDF, and are further described here. There was no difference between HD and HDF groups in age, gender, underlying renal disease, dialysis vintage (median 3.4 months), type of vascular access (AVF in 34 vs 29% on HD and HDF), blood flow or presence of residual renal function. On bioimpedance spectroscopy children on HDF were less likely to have fluid overload compared to HD (Rel OH 4.2 vs 9.8%; p = 0.016), and had lower 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP, 93 vs 87.5 mmHg; p = 0.04). Although there was no difference in interdialytic weight gain, children on HDF required fewer rescue sessions (4.1% HDF vs 19.9% HD; p = 0.008). The height-adjusted pulse wave velocity-SDS was lower in HDF vs HD (0.09 vs 1.33; p < 0.0001) and correlated positively with MAP, ultrafiltration and the blood flow rate. HDF patients had a lower left ventricular mass index (30.7 vs 43.5; p = 0.001). Incident dialysis patients from the same centre did not demonstrate a difference in Rel OH status or MAP between HD and HDF groups, suggesting that centre bias is unlikely and dialysis modality significantly influences the fluid status. Conclusions: Children on HDF have improved fluid control and cardiovascular measures compared to those on HD, and this effect is seen even with a short dialysis vintage of 3.4 months. Introduction: Our aim in this study was to examine longitudinal changes in left ventricular (LV) structure and function and to evaluate factors associating with LV adaptation in children on chronic haemodialysis. Material and methods: Retrospective longitudinal study in a paediatric dialysis centre over past 4 years. Children on chronic haemodialysis with \u22652 m-mode 2D echocardiograms and tissue doppler studies were included. Indexed LV mass (LVM) in g/m 2.7 , geometry and LV function were compared at baseline (dialysis start) with follow-up studies at least 6 months following commencement. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as indexed LVM > 51 g/m 2.7 . We estimated fluid volume status using averaged interdialytic weight changes over 4 weeks prior to echocardiography, and blood pressure (BP) was analysed using 24-h ambulatory monitoring and routine aneroid BP measurements preand post-dialysis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to assess factors associating with LVM index change. Results: 24 of 32 children <18 years were included (n = 6 < 5 years) with last follow-up scan performed following median dialysis duration of 19 months (range 6-64). The prevalence of LVH at baseline was 45.8% (12.5% concentric, 33.3% eccentric) compared with 20.8% (no concentric, 20.8% eccentric) on follow-up, with reduction in mean indexed LVM from 52.3 g/m 2.7 to 39.4 g/m 2.7 (p = 0.001); similar changes were observed for LV mass-for-height z-scores (0.71 vs. -0.43; p = 0.001). Mean fractional shortening changed from 37% to 38% (p = 0.51) and mean E/E' improved from 10.9 to 9.1 (p = 0.04). Multiple regression analysis identified improved systolic BP control and younger age at dialysis commencement as independent predictors for indexed LVM change (p = 0.017 and 0.042 respectively). Conclusions: We report improvement in LV structure and function in children despite being on chronic intermittent haemodialysis. Encouragingly, these findings suggest that cardiovascular health in this population does not always deteriorate but can be stabilised and indeed improved with good BP management over time. Introduction: Pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients depend on optimal dwell time for ultrafiltration and clearance. In clinical practice, most of the pediatric dialysis patients lack optimal dwell time resulting in suboptimal ultrafiltration. However, it is possible to lineate appropriate dwell time from the APEX (Accelerated Peritoneal Examination time), derived from a standardized PET (peritoneal equilibration test). The value of APEX is well recognized and appreciated in adapted peritoneal dialysis (combination sequences of short and long dwells within one peritoneal dialysis session). However, in nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) it may be a potential parameter in maximizing the ultrafiltration. Material and methods: It is a retrospective cohort study, where peritoneal dialysis details were derived from the digital memory card which is incorporated in the dialysis machine (Fresenius cycler-sleep safe (V2.2X). Both paper chart review (for patient data) and electronic chart review (for lab data) were assessed. Results: Out of 15 patients enrolled in our study, mean ultrafiltration significantly improved (p < 0.01) after calculated APEX ( Table 1 ). The mean (SD) were 189.4 \u00b1 44.7. Moreover, mean ultrafiltration remarkably improved (p = 0.006) both in low/low-average and high/high-average peritoneal transporters. In relation to clearance, Kt/V did not change (p = 0.16) before and after APEX ( Table 2 ). The mean (SD) were n = 15, 2.1 \u00b1 0.3. whereas in relation to creatinine clearance, significant improvement (p = 0.04) noted in our study ( Table 2 ). The mean (SD) were n = 15, 46.8 \u00b1 7. Results: At study entry, 24 h-MAP SDS differed significantly between HD (2.9 \u00b1 3.7 SDS), HDF (1.3 \u00b1 1.9), APD (2.1 \u00b1 3.6) and CAPD patients (0.9 \u00b1 3.7). Differences were explained by variation in daytime MAP. Nighttime MAP was more markedly elevated than daytime MAP (night: 2.1 \u00b1 2.5 vs. day: 1.3 \u00b1 3.1 SDS) and not different across treatment modalities. Nocturnal dipping was reduced (<10%) in 49% and even reversed in another 13.4% of patients, without differences between the treatment groups. Median (iqr) LVMI was lower in HDF (40.6 (20.3) g/m 2.16 ) than in all other treatment groups (medians 43.5-45.9 g/m 2.16 ; p = 0.022). In the multivariable longitudinal analysis, 24 h-MAP increased with age (0.5 \u00b1 0.1 mmHg/year;p < .001), decreased by 5.0 \u00b1 0.9 mmHg per L/m 2 daily urine output (p < .001) and was 5.2 \u00b1 1.9 mmHg higher in HD than in CAPD patients (p = 0.007). 24-MAP did not change with time on dialysis. Higher MAP was associated with the use of Ca-channel blockers ( + 4 . 6 \u00b1 1 . 1 m m H g , p < . 0 0 1 ) a n d b e t a -b l o c k e r s (+2.7 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg,p = 0.027). Nocturnal dipping was greater in patients with preserved urine output and higher with APD and HDF than with CAPD. LVMI increased with 24 h-MAP (+0.32 \u00b1 0.04 g/m 2.16 per mmHg, p < .001), BMI (+3.1 \u00b1 0.7 g/m 2.16 per SD,p < .001) and diminishing urine output (\u22123.2 \u00b1 1.6 g/m 2.16 per L/m 2 /d, p = 0.049), and was higher in CAPD than in APD (\u221210 \u00b1 2.5 mmHg, p < .001), HD (\u22129.2 \u00b1 3.5, p = 0.008) and HDF (\u221212.9 \u00b1 4.2, p = 0.002). Conclusions: After multivariate adjustment HD associates with higher 24 h-MAP, and CAPD with lower nocturnal dipping and higher LV mass.",

            "text": "Introduction: Haemodialysis trigger tools (HTT) have been proposed to enable regular monitoring of adverse events in adults during haemodialysis. There is currently no specific HTT available for children. We describe results of a pilot project to monitor adverse events during haemodialysis following development of a paediatric HTT. Material and methods: Prospective data collection was performed using a broadly applicable 'per-dialysis session' tool including 53 triggers across 6 domains. Each trigger was additionally evaluated for level of physical harm; allocation to harm categories was subsequently reviewed jointly by two authors to minimise subjectivity. Trained haemodialysis nurses completed the HTT at the end of designated dialysis sessions in <5 min. Results: The HTT was completed for 91 haemodialysis sessions of 17 children over an eight-week period, in which 139 triggers were identified. The 5 most frequent triggers included: failure to have nursing safety huddle during session (n = 23), need for additional fluid removal (n = 19), need for tissue plasminogen activator infusion (n = 13), need for line reversal and problems with dialysis machine failure (n = 8 each) and delayed reporting of abnormal laboratory results (n = 7). Sixty-three percent of triggers were categorised to have a potential to cause temporary harm and required intervention and others categorised to have no potential for harm. For an individual patient, the need for additional fluid removal was the most frequently cited trigger for potential harm. There were no triggers categorised to have potential to cause permanent harm. Conclusions: This pilot study provides evidence of the risks inherent to paediatric haemodialysis provision and the value of regular monitoring of adverse events using a paediatric HTT. Further cycles of modifications to the HTT with re-testing and continuing team education are ongoing. We would propose the use of paediatric HTT to be included as part of standard care by centres providing haemodialysis to children in the future. Introduction: This study aims to describe a single-center experience regarding the efficiency and longevity of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) created in children weighting \u226420 kg for haemodialysis (HD). Material and methods: We collected data of AVF created using microsurgery techniques between 1988 and 2015. Early failure was defined as the inability to use the AVF even once. Primary patency was defined as the interval time from VA placement until any intervention designed to maintain or reestablish patency and secondary patency as the interval time from VA placement until VA failure. Results: 48 AVF (35 distal, 13 proximal) were created in 41 children with a median weight of 13.5 kg (range 5.5 to 20). Small age and body weight at AVF creation were associated to the need for a second AVF (p = 0.046 and p = 0.019 respectively). Early failure was observed in 6 (12.5%) AVF due to 4 access thromboses and 2 no-maturations. Median time to first utilization in HD was 22 weeks. Cumulative primary patency rates (\u00b1 standard error) at 1 and 2 years were 54.2% (\u00b1 7.2) and 39.6% (\u00b1 7.1) respectively. Secondary patency rates (\u00b1 standard error) at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were 85.4% (\u00b1 5.1), 83.3% (\u00b1 5.4), 70.5% (\u00b1 6.6) and 64.1% (\u00b1 7) and 57.7% (\u00b1 7.2) respectively. The average number of interventions performed per initially functional AVF was 1.36 (range 0-5). One third of thrombosis after AVF utilization were observed at kidney transplantation peri-operative time.",

Time to first utilization is longer than in older children but secondary patency is excellent. Thrombosis rate is considerably high during transplantation surgery. Introduction: Fluid balance is pivotal in the management of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on dialysis. Although many techniques are available to assess fluid status, there are few studies in children. Material and methods: We performed a longitudinal study in 30 CKD children and 13 age-matched healthy controls (71 measurements) to determine a correlation between optimal weight by bioimpedance spectroscopy (Wt-BIS) and clinical assessment (Wt-CA). The accuracy of Wt-BIS (relative overhydration [Rel OH]) was compared against indicators of fluid status such as peripheral blood pressure, central blood pressure, N terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and cardiovascular end-points namely pulse wave velocity (PWV) Z-score for age, left ventricular hypertrophy end diastolic distance (LVEDd) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Results: There was poor agreement between Wt-CA and Wt-BIS among children on dialysis when compared to CKD5 or control subjects (p = 0.01). We developed a modified chart to plot Rel OH against systolic blood pressure (SBP) Z-score for the appropriate representation of volume status and blood pressure in children. A quarter showed SBP above 90th percentile but not with concurrent overhydration. Rel OH correlated with peripheral pulse pressure (p = 0.03; R = 0.3), higher NT-proBNP (p = 0.02; R = 0.33) and LVEDd (p = 0.05;R = 0.38). Central aortic mean and pulse pressure did not correlate with Rel OH but significantly associated with LVEDd. (p = 0.03;R = 0.47 and p = 0.01;R = 0.50 respectively). Systolic BP correlated with PWV Z-score (p = 0.04). Forty percent of children on HD and 30% on PD had increased LVMI. Conclusions: We report a marked discrepancy between BP and hydration status in children on dialysis, suggesting that an objective method for the assessment of hydration status of children on dialysis is necessary.",

There is limited data regarding its clinical utility in children. Aim: Our aim was to investigate the agreement of fluid assessment measured pre-dialysis using BCM-BIS with clinical judgement in children on chronic haemodialysis. Material and methods: Estimated dry weight (EDW) was calculated in all patients using a combination of clinical examination and observations during dialysis and history of symptoms and signs during and/or post dialysis of muscle cramps, dizziness, hypotension or hypertension. As per clinical judgement, the fluid volume to be removed at each dialysis session was calculated as the difference between pre-dialysis weight and EDW (FA clinical ). We analysed agreement of fluid assessment using BCM-BIS (FA bcm ) with FA clinical when the two were <0.5 l; 0.5-1 l; and >1 l with one another. We further analysed fluid assessment as measured by FA bcm with FA clinical as a percent change (gain or loss) of EDW.

Material and methods: Thirty two patients were enrolled in this study, 14 females and 18 males. Their age ranged from 5 to 17 years along with 15 age and sex matched healthy subjects as controls. The inclusion criteria were; the presence of renal anemia, adequate serum iron status with serum ferritin level of 100 ng/ml or more and a transferrin saturation of >20%, normotension or controlled hypertension and no history of valid heart disease or other systemic illness. We analyzed the laboratory and echocardiographic data before starting EPO treatment and after treatment in period of follow up ranged between 4 and 9 months with a mean of 5.8+/\u22121.5 months. Results: Hb level increased from 8.5+/\u22121.87 to 9.3+/\u22121.7 g/dl, Hct level increased from 25.78+/\u22126.59% to 28.88+/\u22125.5%, LVMI showd reduction from 108.8+/\u221241.97 to 97.13+/\u221243.9 g/m2, SV decreased from 59.58+/ \u221221.17 to 53.9+/\u221218.49 ml and finally CO decreased from 5.74+/\u22122.2 to 5+/\u22121.5 L/min. No significant change was detected regarding the HR, EDV, &ESV. LV systolic function was normal at the start of the work and remained so in the follow up examination. Conclusions: We concluded that in patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis, LVH regression can be obtained after partial correction of anemia with rHu EPO which can be also associated with reduction of the high CO encountered in these cases. Weather this regression would improve outcome in haemodialysis patients remain to be established.

Iron supplementation and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) have been recommended for improving anemia in hemodialysis patients. However, there are limited data on the optimal response to achieve sustained normal hemoglobin (Hb) level using maintenance regimen of intravenous iron supplementation in children. Material and methods: In this retrospective cohort study, data of two groups were retrieved from the medical records of pediatric patients on regular hemodialysis. Patients in both groups had normal hemoglobin and iron values (transferrin saturation and ferritin serum level). Group 1 (n = 47) were patients receiving two-weekly 2 mg/kgBW/dose of intravenous iron sucrose for 2 doses without adjusted dose; while group 2 (n = 27) did not receive any iron supplementation. Exclusion criteria included hemolytic anemia, bleeding manifestations, hemoglobinopathies, receiving red blood cell or whole blood transfusion, severely malnourished, evidence of active inflammation or infection and incomplete medical record. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with reduced Hb and TSAT levels. Secondary outcome was side effects of intravenous iron supplementation. Results: We retrieved data of 74 children from the medical records. No difference was found in clinical characteristics and mean values of hemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT between both groups. There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) on the percentage of patients with reduced Hb and TSAT levels between both groups. No clinical side effects was observed; however, iron overload occurred in 6/47 (12.77%) patients receiving intravenous iron.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the changes in the rate of surgical complications and the outcome of PD catheter in a tertiary center in Iran. Material and methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted between 1993 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were all children aged <=14 years with chronic kidney disease who underwent PD. Patients with acute peritoneal dialysis or follow up less than six months were excluded. eGRF was calculated using Schwartz formula. The surgical complications including catheter malfunction, leak, Dacron sheet extrusion, and hernia were considered. Catheter survival, rate of catheter changes, and rate of peritonitis calculated in two time period. P-value less than 0.05 treated statistically significant. Results: During a 19 year interval, 86 PD catheters were inserted in 50 patients, with a median (range) age of 22.5 months. The most common underlying diseases were CAKUT. Median eGFR at the time of operation was 7.8 (4-31.4 ml/min/1.73m 2 ). Catheters were inserted laparoscopicaly in 4.6%. Among surgical complications, 39% of patients developed hernia in median of five months after surgery, in addition catheter malfunction, dislocation, adhesion, or cuff extrusion developed in 22% of cases. The most common reasons for removal were catheter related (outflow failure, adhesion, cuff extrusion) (21%) and infection (peritonitis, tunnel infection) (17.4%). Reoperation for catheter related complication was required in 21 patients (42%). However, the number and the cause of catheter exchange and the outcome of patients were not statistically significant in two time periods; The rate of outflow failure (77% vs. 25%), peritonitis rate (1 per 7.5 vs. 56.9 patient-months) and catheter reinsertion rate (1 per 30.8 vs. 63.7 patient-months) improved significantly from the time period before 2005and afterward. The median (range) follow up of patients was 29 months (6-126 months). Almost 20% transplanted, \u221226% were still on CAPD, 6% switched to hemodialysis, renal function recovered in 10%,, and38% died. Conclusions: This study shows that although improvement in our technique has been accomplished and complications related to technique of insertion are declining; management and care of the catheter in order to reduce peritonitis is still lacking and more should be done to educate nurses and parents and care givers in this regard. Introduction: In pediatric patients on conventional hemodialysis (HD), morbidity is high and quality of life is poor. To overcome these shortcomings of conventional dialysis, intensified HD programs have been developed. The feasibility and outcome in children have been reported from few pediatric dialysis centers only. Material and methods: An online survey was carried out in all 221 pediatric dialysis centers participating in the International Pediatric Dialysis Network (IPDN) to assess, the attitude of pediatric nephrologists towards intensified HD, penetrance into clinical practice and respective barriers. Results: 134 (61%) of the centers replied to the questionnaire. Sixty-nine percent of the pediatric nephrologists recognize sufficient evidence in favor of intensified HD independent from the fact whether they offer intensified HD or not. Fifty percent consider daily nocturnal HD, 21% short daily and 10% intermittent nocturnal HD to offer the best overall patient outcome. Only 2% consider conventional HD to provide the best patient outcome. Eighty percent work in centers where new ideas are greeted, and institutional barriers are few. Fifty-seven percent of pediatric nephrologists always try to convince patients and care givers to apply the best available dialysis modality. Thirty-eight percent of the respondent pediatric nephrologists realize intensified HD in a subgroup of patients, mainly short daily HD. Thirty-six percent of these centers offer home HD. The most important organizational barriers to expand intensified HD programs were lack of adequate funding (66%) and lack of stuff (63%), whereas lack of expertise (21%) and of motivation (14%) were reported infrequently. Conclusions: The majority of nephrologists consider intensified HD as the best HD treatment for children, but a minority only applies it to some of their patients. Inappropriate funding represents the most important barrier for implementation of intensified HD into clinical practice.",

Annual average LTI, normalized protein catabolized rate (nPCR), body mass index (BMI), diuresis, haemoglobin and serum ferritin, albumin, bicarbonate, 25hydroxyvitamin D levels were calculated for each child. Results: 16 children (9 boys, 7 girls) aged from 5 to 17 years old were included. The median study period per child was 2 years (range 1-4). BMI z -score was <\u22121.5 in 6 patients. Total median LTI change of all patients was +5.07%. Total average LTI of each patient was not influenced by sex, age or diuresis status. A significant linear correlation was observed between BMI level and LTI and between BMI z-score and LTI (r = 0.593, p < 0.001 and r = 0.673, p < 0.001). We noticed that only 1 child presented a BMI z-score fall below \u22121.5 during the study period and was the only one who presented an LTI decrease more than 2%. A significant linear correlation was observed between nPCR level and LTI (r = 0.35, p = 0.031). Annual changes of nPCR level was related to those of LTI (Rho = 0.465, p = 0.029) and its annual positive or negative changes were related to similar LTI changes (p = 0.075). 25hydoxyvitamin D level was the only biochemical parameter significantly correlated with LTI (r = 0.331, p = 0.042).

The epidemiological studies of the pediatric ESRD in Algeria are few. The objectives of this study are: Determine the epidemiological characteristics of dialyzed children and Analyze the results of pediatric dialysis. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, we included all patients under the age of 19 years at the time of the ESRD, living in Gharda\u00efa, purified at least 03 months by hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (DP) during the period of ten (10) years: 01/01/2005 to 31/12/ 2014. Information was collected from the medical files, interrogation of patients and their parents. Results: During the period of study, twenty-five (25) children under the age of 19 years have reached the ESRD and have been dialyzed.The average age was 12 years (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , sex ratio (M / F) was 0.9. The calculated annual incidence of ESRD in the pediatric population in Gharda\u00efa was: 15.28 pmarp / yr. (Per million age related population). The prevalence is: 73.36 pmarp. The frequency was high for patients between 10 and 14 years of age (44%). Glomerular nephropathies remain the leading cause of pediatric ESRD in our study (36%). The cortico-resistant nephrotic syndrome (6 cases) is the chief of wire but renal biopsy was rarely practiced (2/6) likewise for the genetic study (2/6). Congenital malformations of the kidneys and the excretory pathwurinary tract (CAKUT) are frequent, dominated by obstructive uropathies (neurological bladder) followed by vesico-ureteral reflux.In 20% of the cases, the etiology was not found. Dialysis was in most cases urgent (68%), anemia was predominantly present at the time of dialysis (88%) and transfusion was necessary in 64% of cases. Hemodialysis is the first treatment method for incident (76%) and prevalent (70%) patients in our series. A very high mortality rate (20%) was founded mainly due to dialysis insufficiency, a very low school enrollment (40%) and a significant retardation of growth (60%). none of our patients was regularly followed in pediatrics during years of dialysis and none of patients benefited from treatment with growth hormone. The transplant rate (4%) is well below the national average (20%), Only 1 patient has been transplanted, obstacles to kidney transplantation are numerous, mainly the absence of donor (58%). Conclusions: Our study is the first work on ESRD of the child in southern Algeria; we have highlighted the following problems:-Late diagnosis of kidney disease-Absence of targeted screening programs-Lack of coordination among practitioners-lack urological surgery for complex CAKUT-Absence of genetic diagnosis in (CRNS, Oxalose, Nephronophtisis ... ..) A comprehensive management of the dialyzed child should enable them to achieve acceptable growth, good schooling and quality of life, require a good training of health care workers and close collaboration between the different treatment practitioners. Introduction: Continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) either as continuous venovenous hemofiltration(CVVH) or hemodia filtration(CVVHD) are used frequently in critically ill children. Many clinical variables and technical issues are known to affect the result. The factors that could be modified to increase the success of renal replacement are sought. As a contribution, we present the data on 104 patients who underwent CRRT within a seven years period. Material and methods:A hundred and four patients admitted between 2009 and 2016 were included in the study. The demographic information, admittance PRISM (Pediatric Risk of Mortality) scores, indication for CRRT, presence of fluid overload, CRRT modality, durations of CRRT and PICU stay were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: The overall rate of survival was 51%. Patients with fluid overload had significantly increased rate of death, CRRT duration and PICU stay. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome as the indication for CRRT, was significantly related with decreased survival when compared to acute renal failure and acute attacks of metabolic diseases. CRRT modality was not different between survivors and nonsurvivors. SMR (Standardized mortality ratio) of the group was calculated to be 0.8. Conclusions: CRRT in critically ill patients is successful in achieving the primary targets of therapy. It has a positive effect on expected mortality in high risk PICU patients. To affect the outcome, follow up should be focused on starting therapy in early stages of fluid overload. Prospective studies defining relative importance of risk factors causing mortality can assist in building up guidelines to affect the outcome.",

It was aimed to evaluate the impact of HC on patient-important outcome parameters including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and inflammation in pediatric dialysis patients. Material and methods: Records of patients followed-up in nine centers (2008-2013) were retrospectively reviewed. Biochemical parameters, complete blood count, CRP, echocardiographic data, monthly-Hb and albumin levels for the last one year were collected, where available. More than 1 g/dL decrease or increase in Hb level was considered as HC. Patients were divided into two groups according to 12-month Hb-trajectory as rare cycling (RC)(\u2264 3) and freuquent cycling (FC)(\u22654 fluctuation) as well as three groups based on time-averaged-Hb levels; <10, 10-11 and >11 g/dl. Results: 245 dialysis patients aged 12.3 \u00b1 5.1 (range: 0.5-21) years were enrolled in this study. Fifty percent of the patients had 1-3 cycling, 82% had 1-5, only 3% had no cycling. There were no differences between HC groups with respect to age, primary renal disease, dialysis modality, having anemia and hospitalization rate, while RC patients had higher urine output (p < 0.01) and higher CRP levels (p < 0.001). Echocardiographic data were available in 137 patients. Although LV mass index (LVMI) was higher in RC than FC group (65 \u00b1 37 vs 52 \u00b1 23 g/m 2.7 , p = 0.056), prevalence of LVH was not different between groups. Time-averaged-Hb levels were inversely correlated with ESA requirement (r = \u22120.497), mean arterial pressure (r = \u22120.213), LVMI (r = \u22120.471) and CRP (r = \u22120.443), but positively with urine output (r = 0.296) and albumin levels (r = 0.275). Patients with time-averaged-Hb levels < 10 g/dl had an increased risk of LVH and inflammation. Conclusions: Hb cycling is common among dialysis patients.Severity of anemia rather than its cycling has more significant impact on the prevalence of LVH and on inflammatory state.",

The aim of the study was to assess survival of children diagnosed with congenital neurogenic bladder in a cohort of patients treated with renal replacement therapy in Poland. Material and methods: A retrospective longitudinal analysis involving 1136 pediatric subjects receiving renal replacement therapy in period 2000-2015 was conducted. Cox proportional hazard method was used to analyse risk of death in children with neurogenic bladder compared to those with other etiologies. Results: 58 children (42 girls, 16 boys) with neurogenic bladder were identified. Hemodialysis was the dominant mode of initial therapy. Seven deaths were reported in this subgroup during 6659 patientyears of follow-up. After adjusting for age, the risk of death among patients with neurogenic bladder was significantly higher than that of all other causes: hazard ratio \u2212 2.95 (95% confidence interval 1.33-6.56). Subjects with neurogenic bladder were older at start of RRT compared to other children (13.85 years vs. 10.13 years, p < 0.001). Average age at death was higher than in the remaining group 15.2 \u00b1 6.9 year vs. 10.1 \u00b1. 7.5 year. The main causes of death were cardiovascular events followed by infections. Conclusions: 1. Children with neurogenic bladder have three time higher mortality on RRT compared to children with other etiologies of ESRD. 2. Age for both start of RRT and at death is higher compared to other children. 3. The main causes of death (cardiovascular and infections) are similar to that observed in the total cohort of children on RRT.",

The two methods were realised during the first 90 min of the same HD session and their results were compared to those acquired from the CDU performed in the same period in a non-HD weekly day. Results: Seventeen simultaneous measurements of AVF flow rate and recirculation with UD and thermodilution method and 17 CDU were realized in 16 patients with a median age of 14.5 and a median weight of 38.4 kg. The median AVF flow rate was 752 ml/ min (range 387-2520) corrected to 1292 ml/min per 1.73m 2 (range 614-3893) with thermodilution, 810 ml/min (range 350-3250) corrected to 966 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (range 513-3675) with UD method and 550 ml/min (range 310-2300) corrected to 750 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2 (range 471-2601) according to the measurement of the CUD. A significant linear correlation was observed between AVF measured with UD method and CUD (r 2 = 0.786, p < 0.001) and between AVF measured with thermodilution and CUD (r 2 = 0.232, p = 0.05).

Consequently some children travel large distances for their dialysis but at a significant cost to their schooling, psychosocial health and family dynamics. Home HD offers an obvious solution but it is not suitable for every family. Material and methods: Objective: We report the case of a 8 year old girl with complex medical needs whose HD was carefully transitioned to East Anglia Childrens hospice close to her home. Results: Patient K with VACTERL has a tracheostomy, colostomy, poor vascular access and renal failure. She travelled up to 3 h each way for incentre HD and had repeated, frequent admissions to hospital with acute, often infective, respiratory symptoms.. Peritoneal dialysis was not an option. Home HD was medically optimal but not possible at home. Therefore we approached the hospice familiar to the family that was providing respite care and proposed a package of care that eventually transitioned Patient K's dialysis care to them. They agreed in principle. Funding was secured from the local council. The NxStage \u2122 dialysis system was chosen as it required no water conversion and was mobile. A robust 3 month training programme was designed and executed for 4 hospice nurses to learn to provide HD in the hospice 4 times/week. A risk assessment and symptoms care plan was written for the patient's specific needs. We secured the hospice local medical support from her local General Paediatric consultant and a honorary contract was put in place which enabled the hospice nurses to dialyse patient K at the local hospital during admissions. The impact has been extremely positive. Patient K is free of dietary and fluid restrictions and is growing. She has made excellent progress at school with improved social skills with children her own age and for the first time mum has worked. The change in the quality of life for Patient K has been dramatic. Conclusions: We present the first reported case of assisted home HD that has been successful in improving a child's health outcomes and rehabilitating them back into school, social and family life. Mum-\"She sings on the way to the hospice and says it's where she goes for a holiday -it's such a relief for me\".",

Material and methods: Method: We describe our enhanced safety approach which enabled a 17 year old with a arterio-venous fistula to transition from in-centre HD to home HD, independently. Results: When planning the possibility of a young adult dialysing independently at home a number of unique safety issues need to be considered and mitigated against in addition to addressing common concerns such as non-adherence to treatment. We individualised the training programme, modifying the standard teaching to incorporate additional safety measures focusing on a heightened awareness and earlier recognition of potential complications. Technology such as medical alarm necklaces and watches, alarm amplifiers and blood leak detectors alerted the young adult or the local medical emergency teams of impending risks or complications. The speed and clarity by which the young adult communicated with the community medical support teams was improved utilising WhatsApp\u00ae and smart phones. After a stable and adverse incident free six months of treatment the young adult transitioned to a nocturnal home programme. Conclusions: A young adult can haemodialyse at home, independently provided strategies are put in place to ensure the safety of the patient in the community. Introduction: The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcomes of the very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates with acute kidney injury (AKI) treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Material and methods: A retrospective study has included 10 VLBW neonates treated with PD. Intravenous (IV) cannula and umbilical venous catheter were used for the peritoneal access. Results: Mean age in the moment of starting PD was 14.9 \u00b1 9.3 days. Mean body weight (BW) was 825 \u00b1 215 g. The average gestational age was 26.3 \u00b1 1.1 weeks. The average duration of dialysis was 20.5 \u00b1 14.7 h. The average ultrafiltration was 7.7 \u00b1 4.2 ml/kg/h. In the moment of starting the PD, the average BW was 302 \u00b1 317 g (22 \u00b1 13%) higher than at birth. The main cause of AKI was sepsis (n = 8/10). The dialysate leak was registered in two patients, one patient had peritonitis and the other one had a blockade of PD catheter. Six patients have died during the PD (severe sepsis), one has died due to hypoxic encephalopathy and coma and two patients have survived. One patient (with hypoxic encephalopathy and coma) has died 10 days after PD was stopped due to sepsis. The overall mortality was 80%. Conclusions: Acute PD is still an appropriate treatment choice for VLBW neonates with AKI. In VLBW neonates, PD can be performed by an improvised PD system and catheters.",

However, the presence of the main features varies in affected families. Material and methods: 0. Results: Here, we present a 16-year-old boy admitted to the Department of Nephrology at the Pediatric Clinic, University Clinical Center of Kosovo, Pristina, Republic of Kosovo because of severe renal in-suf ciency diagnosed 6 years ago, which progressed to end-stage renal failure. Clinical examination on readmis-sion showed a pale, lethargic and edematous child, with auricular deformity, pre-auricular tags and pits as well as bilateral branchial stulae. Laboratory tests revealed high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 15.96 mmol/L and serum creatinine 633.0 mol/L; low glomerular ltration rate (GFR) 12 mL/min./ 1.73 m2 and massive proteinuria 4+. Abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral kidney hypoplasia. A novel mutation of the EYA1 gene was con rmed. Daily hemodialysis is continuing until renal transplantation is done.

The aim of this work was to analyze tissue doppler velocities in a large cohort of children with CKD and to assess risk factors for LV dysfunction. Material and methods: A standardized echocardiographic examination was performed in 128 patients of the 4C Study aged 6-18 years with eGFR 10-60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Tissue doppler measurements included early (E') and late (A') diastolic and systolic (S\u2032) velocity at the mitral and septal annulus of the left ventricle. Measured values were normalized to z scores. Predictors of E'/A', E/E', S\u2032 and LVMI were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Tissue doppler diastolic E' velocity was reduced and A' increased at the mitral and septal annulus, resulting in a reduced E' to A' ratio (z-score \u2212 0.14, p < .0001), indicating diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic function (E'/A') was positively correlated with midwall fractional shortening (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). Reduced diastolic function was independently associated with declining renal function (p = 0.005), increased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.045) and pulse wave velocity (p = 0.07). LV filling pressure E/E' was increased (z-score 0.65, p < .0001) and inversely correlated with the E'/A' ratio. Patients treated by RAS antagonists had significantly lower E/E'. Systolic tissue doppler velocities were significantly decreased (z-score \u2212 0.24, p = 0.001) and inversely correlated to LV filling pressure (r = \u22120.40, p < .0001). The LVMI was not associated to systolic or diastolic tissue doppler velocities. Conclusions: eGFR, systolic blood pressure and the type of antihypertensive medications are significant predictors of diastolic function in children with CKD. Tissue doppler velocities are independent of LV mass and provide sensitive information about early LV dysfunction in this population.",

Studies investigating time-varying arterial load and instantaneous LV geometry as determinants of wall stress in children with hypertension have not been performed. Material and methods: Transthoracic echocardiographic imaging of the left ventricle was performed and endocardial and epicardial volumes obtained from Tomtec wall tracking analysis. Carotid tonometry during systole was used to estimate LV pressure and was calibrated by mean and diastolic blood pressure (BP). MWS was calculated from LV volume and pressure measurements. Eighty children (41 boys) aged 13.0 \u00b1 3.0 (mean \u00b1 SD) years (29 normotension and 51 hypertension) were studied. Results: Children with hypertension were older (Hypertension VS normotensive: 14.1 \u00b1 2.8 VS 11.0 \u00b1 3.3 years, p < 0.001) and have higher body mass index (BMI) (22.3 \u00b1 4.6 VS 19.4 \u00b1 4.3 kg/m 2 , p = 0.007), systolic (132 \u00b1 19 VS 103 \u00b1 11 mmHg, p < 0.001) and diastolic BP (72 \u00b1 16 VS 57 \u00b1 11 mmHg, p < 0.001) than controls.

Peak stress (Normotensive VS Hypertension: 338.8-18.5 VS 397.5-14.3 kdyne/cm 2 , p < 0.001) and mean stress (323.6-14.5 VS 411.7-13.8 kdyne/cm 2 , p < 0.001) was significantly elevated following adjustment for age, BMI and LVM index This relation disappeared after adjustment for blood pressure indices. Conclusions: In children with hypertension, despite evidence of LV geometry alteration, MWS remained elevated and was explained by high blood pressure alone. We would postulate that improved blood pressure control may improve LV remodeling.",

            "text": "Introduction: Obesity and high salt intake are the two most important modifiable risk factors for hypertension. Higher salt intake has been associated with higher systolic blood pressure (BP) in obese children, but not in non-obese children. The impact of dietary salt intake on BP is affected by consumption of potassium. The urine Na/K ratio is a stronger correlate of BP than either sodium or potassium alone. The aim of this study was to determine if there was a difference in salt and potassium intake between obese children with or without hypertension. Material and methods: A total of 34 obese children (22 male) aged 12.6 \u00b1 2.8 (6.9-17.2) years were evaluated. Anthropometric measurements and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring were performed. Estimated salt intake and potassium consumption were determined by 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion, respectively. Children with hypertension were compared with normotensive children with respect to gender, age, BMI z-score, urine Na,K, Na/K ratio and estimated daily salt intake. In addition, correlation of urine sodium and urine sodium/potassium to casual and ambulatory BP values were evaluated. Results: The average estimated salt intake was 9.6 \u00b1 4.3 g/day and it was not different between the hypertensive and normotensive children. Salt intake exceeded the upper limit of the US Dietary Reference Intake in 82% of children. Hypertensive and normotensive children were not different with respect to age, gender, BMI z-score, urine Na, K and Na/K ratio. Estimated salt intake and urine Na/K level were not correlated with ambulatory BP levels. However, office systolic BP measurements were correlated with estimated salt intake (r = 0.431, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate an extremely high salt intake among obese Turkish children. Although hypertensive and normotensive obese children had similar salt and potassium intake, higher salt intake was associated with higher casual systolic BP. Thus, dietary salt reduction interventions along with obesity control programs should be implemented as early as possible. Introduction: Blood pressure (BP) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has been reported to be lower than in the general population, but increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of BP phenotypes and possible differences in arterial stiffness in pediatric patients with sickle/beta-thalassemia compared with matched controls. Material and methods: We included in the study 16 pediatric S/b-thal patients and 16 controls matched for age and sex. Controls were otherwise healthy children and adolescents visiting our hypertension center for suspected hypertension. All patients underwent ambulatory BP monitoring, measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). Office hypertension was defined as office BP levels \u226595th percentile for age, gender and sex. Ambulatory hypertension was defined as daytime and/or nighttime BP greater than the 95th percentile for sex and height. Results: Mean age of the study population was 13.30 \u00b1 4.63 years (34.4% boys). Despite lower office systolic BP levels (115.43 \u00b1 10.03 vs. 123.37 \u00b1 11.92 mmHg, S/b-thal vs. controls, P = 0.05), there was no statistical significant difference in 24 h, daytime and nighttime BP. Twenty five % of the S/b-thal patients and 43.8% of the controls presented office hypertension (P = NS), while 18.8% of the S/b-thal patients and 25% of the controls presented hypertension by ambulatory BP levels (P = NS). All S/b-thal patients with office hypertension presented normal ambulatory BP values (white-coat hypertension). None of the S/b-thal patients had daytime hypertension, while all 18.8% presented nighttime hypertension with office normotension <90th percentile (masked hypertension). S/b-thal patients and controls presented equal prevalence of masked hypertension (19%). S/b-thal patients presented also similar levels of cf.-PWV with controls (7.1 \u00b1 1.25 vs. 7.25 \u00b1 1.43 m/s, P = NS) and an 18.8% of the patients presented cf.-PWV levels above the 95th pc for age and sex. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with S/b-thal present similar prevalence of BP phenotypes and levels of cf.-PWV with pediatric population referred for suspected hypertension. A significant number of children and adolescents with S/b-thal may have nighttime hypertension despite normal office BP levels.",

Prevalence of systolic or diastolic hypertension was 9.4% and 8.4%, respectively and frequency of AHI > 5 was 16.7%. Systolic hypertension was a significant predictor of moderate-to-severe OSAS (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1-4.1;P = 0.02), but diastolic hypertension was not (OR 1.2; 0.6-2.5; P > 0.05). The odds of AHI > 5 prior to considering systolic hypertension was 0.20 and after considering its presence increased to 0.40 (Bayes theorem), i.e. for every 6 children with snoring undergoing PSG, 1 had AHI > 5, while for every 4 children with systolic hypertension and snoring tested, 1 was found to have AHI > 5. Conclusions: In the context of systolic hypertension and snoring in an otherwise healthy child, referral for PSG to rule out moderate-to-severe OSAS seems to be clinically appropriate. Introduction: Increased arterial stiffness is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. One way to measure arterial stiffness is the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), which is the relationship between diastolic and systolic ambulatory blood pressure (BP) over 24 h. In this prospective study, we studied the difference in AASI between obese and lean children. Material and methods: AASI was calculated from ABPM in 53 obese children (33 girls) and compared with age-and gendermatched 42 healthy subjects (20 girls). AASI was obtained by performing a linear regression analysis of diastolic BP over systolic BP and subtracting the regression slope from 1. Hypertension was defined according to the criteria of American Heart Association. To evaluate inflammation, the blood level of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured. Results: The mean age was 10.6 \u00b1 2.83 years in obese children and 11.3 \u00b1 3.17 years in healthy subjects. Hypertension was determined in three (5.6%) obese children. AASI was significantly increased in obese children compared to healthy subjects (median, IQR: 0.43, (0.13-0.73) versus 0.28, (\u22120.05-0.85), p < 0.001).

In a univariate analysis, AASI was independently correlated with indexed casual systolic blood pressure (cSBP, p = 0.026), nighttime SBP-standard deviation score (p = 0.005), systolic (p < 0.001) and diastolic (p = 0.022) nocturnal dipping, and hsCRP (p = 0.02). In a multivariate analysis, AASI was independently predicted by indexed cSBP (p = 0.005) and systolic nocturnal dipping (p = 0.010).",

            "text": "Introduction: Accidental discovery of high blood pressure in children usually requires unnecessary consultation, admission and investigation. Most of accidently measured high blood pressure in the clinics or emergency is falsely labelled as \"hypertension\". Reactive or \"white coat hypertension\" is the most common cause of that medical staff and family worry. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is complex and expensive method to confirm this phenomenon. We invented a novel valid and reliable diagnostic score to use mainly for the newly discovered high blood pressure. This score is considered a simple, effective and rapid tool to avoid the unnecessary work-up and to objectively decide the next action. Material and methods: The diagnostic score is composed of 10 items with grades for each item 1, 2 or 3. The total minimum score is 10 and the maximum is 30. Score of 12 or less exclude the hypertension and requires no action needed. Score of 25 or more diagnose hypertension and requires consultation, work-up and treatment. Score from 13 to 24 needs monitoring (score 20-24) or reassessment after 48 h (score 13-19). The score is used prospectively in 30 children on their first consultation and or referral for high blood pressure reading (considering hypertension) and then validated to the final diagnosis to confirm or to rule out pediatric hypertension and its management. Results: The majority of the children (56.6%) have transient or false hypertension and they scored less than 13 with a mean10.9 \u00b1 1. Only 16.6% scored 25 or above (mean 26.4 \u00b1 1.3) and those are considered as hypertensive by the scoring system. 26.6% scored between 13 and 24; the majority of those (75%) are between 13 and 18 and 25% are between 19 and 22. Data is revalidated within 7 days to evaluate and compare the score to the final confirmation or exclusion of hypertension. Results showed 100% of the children scored 25 or above were diagnosed as hypertensive 80% started on medication. Eighty-eight percent of the children scored 12 or less (and one extra child was missed) have normal blood pressure started from the second or third day and confirmed on follow up outpatient clinic visit. 37.5% of the remaining group (score 13-24) had persistently high blood pressure on monitoring and follow up. Conclusions: The novel pediatric systemic hypertension diagnostic score showed a significant accuracy validity and reliability for the diagnosis and for the recommended further action. Because it is simple, cheap, fast, accurate and reliable, we recommend its mass use in practice at least as a screening tool to select the children require further work-up or management. Larger multicenter study is needed to give more evidence for this new scoring system. Introduction: The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of malignant hypertension (MHT) on left ventricular mass and mechanics using advanced echocardiographic techniques to quantify changes in left ventricular (LV) adaptation following management of hypertension. Material and methods: Children with MHT \u226416 years of age were identified. Left ventricular assessment was performed retrospectively using M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), in addition to 2D and 3D speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). Hypertension was defined according to the Fourth Report of the National Blood Pressure Education Program. LV mass (LVM) was calculated by Devereux formula and indexed to height (g/m 2.7 ). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as indexed LVM (LVMI) for height z-scores > 1.64SD. Results: 37 patients (age 9 \u00b1 6, years) with mean glomerular filtration rate (82.11 \u00b1 34.9 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) and mean SBP zscores (6.25 \u00b1 2.82), showed abnormal LVM and mechanics at presentation. The mean LVMI z-score was 2.1 \u00b1 2.4, with 22 patients (62%) exhibiting LVH at presentation. There were significant changes for 2DSTE longitudinal strain (LS) (\u221214.82 \u00b1 4.2 vs.-20.74 \u00b1 2.8, %; p < 0.001) and circumferential strain (CS) (\u221213.74 \u00b1 5.5 vs.-20.65 \u00b1 5.2, %; p < 0.001) between baseline and last visit. Similarly, significant changes were observed in 3DSTE LS (p 0.002), CS (p0.020) and radial strain (RS) (p.0.004). LVMI z-scores showed significant reduction (2.1 \u00b1 2.4 vs.01 \u00b1 2.1; p < 0.001) over time. These changes though were not related to extent of reduction in the blood pressure despite relatively strong positive association (r 2 = .6; p0.65). Adjustment for potential confounders (heart rate and type of antihypertensive medication) has changed the strength of association, but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Abnormal indices of LV mass and mechanics are evident in children with MHT with changes reversible on management of blood pressure. It is possible that other factors such as class of antihypertensive agent have an impact on LVM and deformation beyond reduction of blood pressure alone.",

Although the clinical value in children is not yet established its use is increasing in children and adolescents with cardiovascular risk factors.

The purpose of this study was to validate PWV assessment with novel oscillometric device (SphygmoCor XCEL) for use in children and adolescents. Material and methods: Children and adolescents aged 5-20 years were recruited subsequently. Carotid-femoral PWV (PWVton) was measured by applanation tonometry with the \"classic\" Sphygmocor device and by SphygmoCor XCEL device (PWVosc). Regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots were used for comparison of the tonometer-to oscillometric-based method. ARTERY Society guidelines criteria were used to assess the performance of the oscillometric device. Results: Sixty-eight children and adolescents with mean age 11.5 \u00b1 3.6 years, 32 (47.1%) male were included in the analysis.

The aim of our pilot study was to investigate their role in children and adolescents with cardiovascular risk factors -hypertension, obesity and hypercholesterolemia. Material and methods: 176 children and adolescents have been included in the study and divided in four groups: 31 children and adolescents with hypertension, 36 with overweight, 49 with hypertension and overweight and 70 with hypercholesterolaemia. They were compared to a control group of 50 healthy individuals. In each patient blood pressure, anthropometrical parameters, and pulse wave analysis (PWA) measurements using applanation tonometry technique were performed and calculations made, including SEVR and ER. Results: The results show a statistically significant difference in ED (p = 0.013), but not in SEVR (p = 0.074) in hypercholesterolemia group in comparison to control group. In other research groups, compared to control group, no statistically significant differences in both parameters have been found. In all study groups, SEVR correlated significantly with age and heart rate as well as with central mean pressure. In addition, the correlation between ED and both heart rate and age has also been comfirmed. Conclusions: In our pilot study the important role of SEVR and ED in early cardiovascular risk determination in children has not been confirmed. However, some results do indicate a potential role of both, at least in hypercholesterolemia, and should be further investigated. Introduction: Non-farmacological treatments of hypertension include lowering the salt load in the diet, consuming more fruits and vegetables, and less saturated fats. Recent research has shown that consuming sweet beverages could elevate blood pressure. It may be postulated that fructose might increase BP by influencing the uric acid genaration pathway. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of decreasing dietary fructose on arterial stiffness. Material and methods: This study was a prospective clinical analysis of the influence of decreasing the daily fructose load. Forty-one individuals aged 12-18 with elevated blood pressure (70% with hypertension, 30% with pre-hypertension) participated in this study. A questionnaire was used to assess the day-to-day diet. Blood pressure measurements and applanation tonometry were performed to assess arterial stiffness. A dietitian instucted participants to lower their fructose intake by 10%. After 6 weeks of a low-fructose diet, the same measurements were repeated. Patient adherence was validated by assessing the urine uric acid-tocreatine ratio (uUA/Cr).

Aortic systolic blood pressure was also lower (103 vs 100 mmHg, p = 0.02), with no changes in diastolic blood pressure. Augmentation index adjusted for heart rate tended to be lower after decreasing diatary fructose (5.0 vs 2,0, p = 0.07). There was a significant fall in the uUA/Cr after applying the diet (0.4 vs 0.07 mg/mg, p < 0,001) which confirmed the participants adherence to the protocol. Conclusions: Decreasing dietary fructose may improve arterial stiffness without affecting blood pressure. Our data suggests that a low-fructose diet could be a beneficial component of a non-pharmacological treatment in children with hypertension. Introduction: The incidence of accessory renal artery (ARA) varies between 4%-27% in general population. Although most of the cases with renal artery stenosis (RAS) are due to renal vascular involvement of systemic disorders, intrinsic renal vascular abnormalities such as accessory RAS also account an important percentage of renovascular hypertension (RVH) in childhood. The aim of this study was to investigate renovascular abnormalities with renal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in hypertensive children whose blood pressure was difficult to control with medical treatment. Material and methods: Clinical data and MRA findings of 49 treatment resistant hypertensive patients who were followed in our institution between 2015 and 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Forty nine patients diagnosed with essential hypertension were enrolled in this study. The ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM) of all had revealed increased blood pressure load despite of medical treatment with one antihypertensive drug. Mean systolic blood pressure load was 44.37 \u00b1 7,89 and diastolic blood pressure load was 21.08 \u00b1 3,41 and the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in patients with RVA were 139.6 \u00b1 3,2 and 82.7 \u00b1 2,8 respectively, despite of anti-hypertensive medication. The mean age of patients with RVA was 13.6 \u00b1 0,4 years old and 10 of 18 patients were male (55%). Eighteen of them (36.7%) were found to have renal vascular abnormalities (RVA) consistent with accessory renal artery, 7 were left, 7 were right and 4 were both sided. Plasma renin levels of 12 patients (66%) were within the normal limits. Renal arterial doppler ultrasound was normal in 10 patients (56%). Conclusions: Presence of accessory renal artery is a common finding in hypertensive children and MR angiographic investigation should be kept in mind even in the presence of normal plasma renin levels and renal doppler US. Introduction: The prevalence of hypertension in children with multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) varies between 0 to 8% based on casual blood pressure (BP) measurements. However; there is limited data on the prevalence of hypertension evaluated by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in these patients and the rate is up to 20%. The aims of the present study were to evaluate prevalence of and risk factors for ambulatory hypertension in children with MCDK. Material and methods: This cross-sectional single center study enrolled 31 children (16 male, aged 5-17 years) with MCDK and age, gender and BMI similar 20 healthy children. All subjects were evaluated by casual and ambulatory BP measurements. Ambulatory BP findings were classified according to the updated American Heart Association recommendations in children. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in all patients and controls. Renal ultrasound examinations were performed in the patient group. Total renal volume was calculated and adjusted to height (defined as renal volume index). Results: There were no differences in SD scores of ABPM values between the patient and the control groups. Three patients (9.6%) were diagnosed as hypertensive based on ABPM; two were classified as masked hypertension and one as sustained hypertension. In addition, two patients had white coat hypertension (WCH) and another two had prehypertension. In the control group, only one patient had WCH. There was no difference in PRA levels between the patient and control groups. Five patients (16%) had accompanying urological abnormalities in the contralateral kidney and 26 (84%) showed compensatory hypertrophy. None of the three hypertensive patients had contralateral urological abnormality; while only one did not reveal compensatory hypertrophy. There was no significant relationship between renal volume index and ABPM values. Conclusions: The mechanism(s) of hypertension in patients with MCDK is obscure. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify pathogenesis of hypertension in these patients.",

In the case of resistant hypertension (failure of medical therapy despite full dose of \u22653 drugs including diuretic), surgical techniques can improve control of blood pressure (BP). Material and methods: This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent combined medical and surgical in our clinic for renovascular hypertension (RVH) between 1999 and 2016. Results: A total of 9 children (7 boys, 3 months-14 years, median age 5.5 years) were underwent the complex of clinical, laboratory and instrumental investigations. All of them had normal glomerular filtration rate, different degree of microalbuminuria (30 mg/g > microalbumin/ creatinine < 150 mg/g) and second organ damage (heart -5/9, kidneys \u22126/9 and eyes -6/9). The BP level was above the 95th centile for age and height in all children (up to 180/120 mmHg). In clinic everyone were treated for resistant hypertension by different combined therapy. Seven children had renal artery stenosis (3unilateral, 4 -bilateral), 1 -had midaortic syndrome, 1had aneurysm of renal arterial. There was no children with vasculitis or Takayasu arteritis. The angiography was performed in all children, with separate detection of plasma renin activity in renal veins (in all children it was extremely high -10-20 normative values, in the case of bilateral lesionit was more than in 1.5 times higher than in the side of stenosis), also 3/9 patienthad underwent to the percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty during angiography, but it was unsuccessful. All patients received renovascular surgery on the renal arteries: 4unilateral, 2 -bilateral autologous surgery, 1reimplantation of renal artery and 1 -aortic reconstruction with a synthetic graft. One 3 year old boy with bilateral stenosis had undergo autologous surgery only in one side, because of severe total condition. Fibromuscular dysplasia was the most common morphological diagnosis (6/9). Post-operative complications were hemorrhage (1/9), that indicated repeated surgery (without nephrectomy) and 1/9 had failed hemodynamics, which required resuscitation (was successful). There were no peri-or postoperative deaths. BP was improved in all 9 children and of those 5 (4 -with unilateral, 1with bilateral RAS) were cured (havent antyhypertensive therapy in a 1-year after the operation). Conclusions: All children are needed to measurement the BP, because moderate or even severe elevated blood pressure (for example, as a result of RVH) often is unspecific or have no symptoms. If the case of RVHmedical treatment must undergo immediately, but if it is not enoughsurgery should not be delayed. In our exclusively pediatric population angioplasty safely improved blood pressure control in all of patients, more than half of which are cured.",

The objective of the present study was to assess the potential early effects of hypertension on the brain in children by evaluating neurocognitive test performance. Material and methods: We evaluated executive function in hypertensive children compared to normotensive ones in a cross-sectional study. All children and adolescents included in the study underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Hypertension was defined as daytime and/or nighttime BP greater than the 95th percentile for sex and height. BP index was calculated as mean BP divided by the 95th BP pc specific for each child. To evaluate executive function parents completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), a rating scale that evaluates different aspects of executive function behaviors in the home environment during child's everyday life. Results: The study population included 38 children and adolescents, mean age 12.18 \u00b1 3.26, 47.4% boys. Fifty % of the children had hypertension (88% secondary causes). Hypertensive children compared to normotensives had higher T scores (52.00 \u00b1 9.42 vs. 39.94 \u00b1 11.63, p < 0.05) and percentiles (60.82 \u00b1 25.31 vs. 30.17 \u00b1 25.98, p < 0.001) in the clinical scale of organization of materials. The statistically significant differences persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and e-GFR. When daytime and nighttime hypertension were examined separately children with nighttime, but not those with daytime hypertension presented significantly higher values in T scores and percentiles for organization of materials. BP elevation expressed by BP index presented significant correlations with BRIEF scales after adjustment for e-GFR, hemoglobin levels, age and sex. Systolic daytime and nighttime BP index correlated with monitor percentile (r = 0.72, p < 0.01, and r = 0.66, P < 0.05, respectively), while diastolic daytime BP index correlated with both monitor percentile and organization of materials percentile (r = 0.64, p < 0.05 and r = 0.63, p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusions: BRIEF scores were higher in the hypertensive children suggesting worse executive function compared with the normotensives subjects. Correlations of BRIEF scales with BP measures occurred even within the normal limits of the rating scale implying that early effect of BP on the brain may occur within the normal range of the neurocognitive measures. Introduction: 1) To determine prevalence of hypertension in children <16 years of age in Denmark. 2) To study aetiology of the hypertension and complication at start of pharmacological treatment for hypertension. Material and methods: Using nationwide health registries with ICD-10 codes from hospitalized and out-patient-clinic patients, we extracted data on all hypertensive children seen from 30th April 2014 to 1st May 2015. The prevalence of hypertension in patients <16 years in Denmark was calculated. Medical records of all hypertensive children from Central and Eastern Denmark, corresponding to approximately 55% of Danish population, were reviewed and patients with antihypertensive pharmacological treatment were included. Results: The prevalence of hypertension in children <16 years in Denmark is 0.03% (330/1.030.766). The prevalence of pharmacologically treated hypertension in children was 0.02% (126/553.784 ). Of the pharmacologically treated, 82% (103/ 126) had secondary hypertension. The most common cause was of renal aetiology (n = 68). Among the renal patients, 68% (46/68) had decreased glomerular filtration rate and 73% (46/63) had proteinuria. Baseline evaluation of target organ damage was done in most hypertensive children with primary or non-renal aetiologies (n = 58), echocardiography in 98% (57/58) of cases and retinal exam in 90% (52/58) of cases. Significantly fewer patients with renal aetiology received echocardiography in 63% (43/68) of cases, (p < 0.001) and retinal exam in 60% (41/68) of cases (p < 0.001). Among the examined patients, hypertensive retinopathy was found in 23% of patients and septum hypertrophy in 34% of patients irrespective of cause. Conclusions: Considering the low prevalence of hypertension in children <16 years in Denmark, Danish national guidelines for blood pressure screening in children should be revised. Furthermore, considering the large proportion of target organ damage efforts should be done to ensure that hypertensive children undergo thorough evaluation for target organ damage prior to initiation of pharmacological management.",

Material and methods: The study included 59 children, aged 7.5 \u00b1 1,9 years and follow-up of HUS 5.12 \u00b1 2,07 years. All patients underwent daily blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), determined daily urine losses of protein and albumin. Results: AH was diagnosed in 16 (27.1%) children (9 with antihypertensive therapy and 7 without it). According ABPM established the prevalence of different forms of AH in children after HUS: prehypertension in 10.2% of patients, white coat hypertension in 13.6% and masked AH in 6.8%. AH was detected with high frequency as those who received dialysis in the acute period of HUS, so without it (29.6% and 20%, respectively). High blood pressure was defined mainly at night due to systolic BP with high load and insufficient night dipping. In some patients obesity worsened the systolic hypertension, which persisted throughout the day. Microalbuminuria was found in 50% of children with hypertension and was closely correlated with the severity of renal damage in the acute period of HUS (r s = 0.4; p < 0.05) and AH (r s = 0,41, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Considering the predominantly nocturnal AH in children after HUS, 24 h monitoring of blood pressure is given a key role in its diagnosis. The detection of pathological microalbuminuria is the indication for carrying out ABPM, even if normal office blood pressure.

Material and methods: The 14-month-old girl was presented with polydipsia,poliuria,and fatigue.She had a history of having a brother who was being followed with the diagnosis of Bartter syndrome.Physical examination findings were normal except for her weight which was below 3rd percentile.Laboratory findings indicated hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis,hypostenuria and hypercalciuria.Urine output was high as 25-30 cm 3 /kg per hour.Although the diagnosis of Bartter syndrome was suspected based on those clinical and laboratory findings,low plasma renin activity (<0.1 ng/mL/h) and high blood pressure levels during the follow up excluded Bartter syndrome.Cortisol to cortisone ratio was found to be high in 24-h urine,indicating AME syndrome.Her brother was also using antihypertensive therapy and he had stage 2 hypertensive retinopathy and left ventricular hypertrophy.He was evaluated for AME syndrome;he had a low plasma renin activity and high 24-h urinary cortisol to cortisone ratio.His renal ultrasound showed bilaterally medullary nephrocalcinosis but the female case had normal renal ultrasound. Results: Both siblings were diagnosed as AME syndrome and the diagnosis was confirmed by steroid metabolites and homozygote mutations in 11 beta-HSD2 gene.They are being followed in a good condition under the therapy with oral potassium chloride, spironolacton and hydrochlorotiazide treatments.",

Introduction: The ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is not obligatory test for diagnosis of blood hypertension (BH) in children with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). But it know that about 1/3 of children with CKD has masked hypertension which associates with left ventricular hypertrophy. The aim was to determine the accuracy of casual clinic blood pressure measurement (CBPM) for diagnosis of blood pressure hypertension in children with CKD. Material and methods: Demographic, clinical, laboratory date including CBPM and ABPM were obtained in 359 children with CKD (mean age 12.68 \u00b1 3.13 years; F/M = 1.03; mean eGFR = 84.18 \u00b1 29,6 ml/min/ 1,73m 2 ). Normal casual blood pressure (BP) defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90th percentile for gender, age, height. Ambulatory BH was defiened as mean wake and/or sleep SBP and/or DBP levels \u226595th percentile for gender, age, height. White coat hypertension (WCH) was defined as casual clinic SBP and/or DBP \u226595th percentile for gender, age and height but mean wake and sleep SBP and DBP <95th percentile for gender, age and height. Masked hypertension (MH) was defined as normal casual clinic SBP and DBP and mean wake and/or sleep SBP and/or DBP \u2265 95th percentile for gender, age and height. Results: BH was revealed in 100 pts. (q = 0.28) and in 199 pts. (q = 0.55) by CBPM and ABMP, respectively. The 18 children (q = 0.05) had WCH; 99 pts. (q = 0.27) had MH. The most pts. with MH (n = 56; q = 0.57) had isolate sleep systolic and/or diastolic BH; 4 pts. (q = 0.04) had isolate wake systolic BH; whole day systolic and diastolic BH was diagnosed in 8 (q = 0.08) and 10 (q = 0.1) children, respectively; whole day systolic-diastolic BH was detected in 21 pts. (q = 0.21). Ambulatory BH was revealed in about 1/5 of children with normal casual BP and in more than 2/5 of pts. with casual BP = 90-95\u2030 (tabl.1). There was high incidence of overdiagnosis of BH by CBPM. The sensitivity/specificity of CBPM for the diagnosis of ambulatory systolic and diastolic BH were 0.6/0,82 and 0.5/0.78, respectively with positive predict value 0.5 for systolic BH and 0.42 for diastolic BH. Introduction: IgA vaskulitis is the most common vasculitis seen in childhood. Though kidney involvement is a major factor affecting prognosis, every organ on body might be affected. The aim of this study is to determine the organ involvement and clinics, to identify the risk factors that increase the nephritis and to determine the long-term prognosis of patients with IgA vasculitis. Material and methods: 415 IgA vasculitis patients who were followed in 1990 and 2016 in Erciyes University Pediatric Nephrology and Rheumatology Department were included into the study. Patients files were reviewed retrospectively. The patients presenting semptoms, organ involvement, treatment and long-term prognosis were determined. Results: In our study, 415 patients diagnosed with IgA vasculitis (HSP) were evaluated. Of the patients, 173 (41.7%) were female and 242 (58.3%) were male. The mean reference age was 8.3 \u00b1 3.1 years. Skin involvement was found 100%, joint involvement was 77.1%, GIS involvement was 58.6%, renal involvement was 38.3%, scalp edema was 10.1%, scrotal involvement was 5.3% and central nervous system involvement was 1.6%. Pulmonary involvement was detected in a child. One patient died from pulmonary involvement and one patient died from infectiuos complication possibly due to Eculizumab. When risk factors for nephiritis were assessed, it was found that gastrointestinal involvement was more frequent in those with nephritis (p = 0.01). Age, diastolic blood pressure and GIS involvement were correlated with renal involvement, and GIS involvement and diastolic blood pressure are found to be risk factors for renal involvement.",

The regional pathway recommends a six-month nurse led follow-up with stratification of children into either Standard pathway(SP) or Proteinuria pathway(PP) at one week after presentation with PP cohort at increased risk of renal involvement. Our objectives were to compare our local practice management with regional pathway and study its cost implications. Material and methods: A retrospective audit involving 50 consecutive children (33\u2642;17\u2640) diagnosed with HSP from 2011 to 14 formed the study cohort. The mean age at presentation was four years and one child was followed-up at a different organisation. At presentation blood pressure(BP) and urine analysis(UA) were undertaken in all 50 patients. Twenty-nine patients had normal UA and BP, 16 had abnormal UA and 4 had hypertension. All 49 patients were evaluated at one week and subclassified into SP (47) and PP (2), but additional 5 children in SP developed proteinuria during the study course. Results: SP cohort had far more than recommended number of health professional(HP) reviews, UA and BP but at random/ variable frequency. Majority of PP cohort missed the key intensive scheduled reviews. UA and BP was done at majority of the reviews but none had Primary investigations (urea and electrolytes, urine microscopy and urine protein creatinine ratio) potentially missing out on early identification of renal involvement. None of the seven patients in Proteinuria pathway developed any long-term renal sequelae. Altogether there were at least 171 HP reviews, and 15 inpatient admissions which were unwarranted and far more frequent UA monitoring. This created more anxiety/inconvenience amongst families and stretched HP resources.",

Recurrent eczema and diarrhea had been noted in the previous months. Laboratory results revealed nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, haematuria, anaemia and thrombocytopenia with normal kidney function. All immunological markers tested including ANA, ANCA, anty GBM antibodies, C3, C4, CH50 were normal. Regulatory T cell count was within reference range. Standard steroid therapy was prescribed and due to lack of remission after 4 weeks, cyclosporine was introduced. Due to onset of neurological symptoms cyclosporine had to be withdrawn. Results: Genetical testing confirmed the diagnosis of IPEX revealing a deletion in the terminal part of exon of the gene encoding FOXP3 (NM_014009).

Introduction: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis in children and skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys are involved. Renal involvement, range from asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to severe renal disease, is the main origin of the resulting chronic disease. It is believed that HSPN is an immune complex nephritis and the activation of the complement system appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology. Material and methods: In this case report, we discuss a patient with HSPN who had a complement system defect and did not give complete response to Eculizumab. Results: The nine years old girl presented with typical clinical picture of HSPN verified with kidney biopsy. Her complements levels were normal. She was given prednisolone, cyclosporine, AZA, cylophosphamide, PLEX and RTX. However, she did not give reasonable response to immunosuppressive medications. Repeated kidney biopsy showed sclerosis in 17 of 26 glomeruli and cellular crescent in the rest of the glomeruli. So, we decided to start eculizumab with an experience coming from IgA nephritis. Initially, she gave a partial response to Eculizumab. Finally, ESRD was developed. Homozygous mutation in Factor H gene was detected in a study of a complement system. While she was on peritoneal dialysis, she experienced with osteomyelitis on the left foot. She died possibly because of complication of osteomyelitis.",

The main symptom is a palpable purpura, but inflammation can also affect joints and multiple organs, especially the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys. Mostly the disease is self-limiting and has a good prognosis. In complicated cases, treatment is often guided by the degree of renal involvement. Material and methods: We report on a 3-year-old girl who presented with palpable purpura and abdominal colicky pain. Due to severe enterocolitis, therapy with prednisolone was started. But despite treatment recurrent episodes with acute abdomen including intraperitoneal bleeding and ileus occurred. She developed a nephriticnephrotic syndrome (macrohematuria, arterial hypertension, protein/creatinine up to 24 g/g and azotemia with blood urea up to 30 mmol/l) which was treated with mycophenolate initially and due to inadequate response, cyclosporine was added. Four weeks later, complex focal seizures occurred and EEG and cMRT showed severe pathological findings. After a skin biopsy proved IgA-vasculitis, therapy with methylprednisolone-pulse combined with rituximab treatment achieved a remission. In the next 4 months, she claimed about abdominal distension, intermittent abdominal pain and petechial lesions recurred. A further progress could be stopped by increasing the dose of prednisolone and continuing combined immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and mycophenolate. However, 6 weeks later she developed a severe relapse with acute abdominal pain and nephrotic-nephritic syndrome. Despite monitoring showed complete CD20 depletion in peripheral blood, rituximab treatment in combination with methylprednisolone pulses were again successful. Immunosuppression was continued with daily prednisolone, cyclosporine, mycophenolate and low dose methylprednisolone 200 mg/m 2 every 2nd-4th week. After 6 months during an upper airway infection, there was another episode with acute abdominal pain and nephritic syndrome but without purpura. We decided to stop the regular methylprednisolone infusions and continue rituximab treatment every 3-4 months despite no detectable CD20 in peripheral blood.

Conclusions: With respect to ALMS Trial, our study confirmed that choosing a treatment regimen does not influence induction. We note an improvement of SLEDAI2K when MM is associated with CT vs. when CYC is associated with CT vs. CT only for induction. We admit as limitations of the study the number of patients and that disease activity at diagnosis may bias the selection of agents to treat. Immunofluorescence detected IgG deposits in 11/13 with C3 in 10/13. In four, there were slight deposits of IgA (2) and IgM (2) and C1q (2) with chains lambda y kappa (1). Treatment included ACEI or ARA-II in 9, with prednisone 6. One was treated with acetylsalicylic acid. Nine received prednisone (6 NS and 3 NP). Two children with RF were treated with IECA, prednisone and cyclophosphamide. At mean 9 years of follow-up (1-11 years) : patients with NS: three complete remission; two proteinuria >1 g; two proteinuria <1 g (1 with RF and hypertension normalized blood pressure and glomerular filtration) and one are in chronic RF G3b stage without proteinuria. Patients with NP: two complete remission and 1 proteinuria <1 g. Patients with proteinuria <1 g: 1 developed NP and 1 proteinuria <1 g with chronic RF G2 stage. Conclusions: In childhood, the most typical presentation of idiopathic MN is nephrotic syndrome.

There are no experimental data to explain these clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cysteamine on bone cells. Material and methods: Osteoclasts were differentiated from circulating monocytes isolated from blood, in patients with nephropathic cystinosis (n = 7) and age-and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 7).Cells were treated with increasing doses of cysteamine (50-200 \u03bcM/L) during the differentiation process or after a normal differentiation process to evaluate the impact of cysteamine on differentiation and resorption, respectively. Osteoclast differentiation and activity were evaluated by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and bone resorption assays. Osteoblasts were differentiated from murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Differentiation was evaluated trough (Osteocalcin,Osterix,Collagen 1 time course expression), alkaline phosphatase and Von Kossa staining.

            "text": "In vitro low doses of cysteamine impair osteoclastic resorption and stimulate osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization. However when used at higher doses, an inhibitory effect on osteoblastic proliferation is observed. These results could explain, at least partly, the bone phenotype observed in patients receiving high doses of cysteamine. Introduction: As patients receive cysteamine and improve survival, bone impairment appears to be a novel complication of nephropathic cystinosis. Even though the exact underlying pathophysiology is unclear, six hypotheses are discussed: copper deficiency, bone consequences of severe hypophosphatemic rickets during infancy, cysteamine toxicity, abnormal thyroid metabolism, chronic hypoparathyroidism and/or direct bone effect of the CTNS mutation. The objective of this study was to evaluate bone status in the French Crystobs study. Material and methods: In addition to clinical data, bone status was evaluated with biomarkers (copper, ALP, PTH, 25-D, 1-25D), DXA (spine) and High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) at the tibia and radius. Results were compared to age-and gender-matched healthy controls (1:2 basis) from the local reference cohorts (OFELY in women, STRAMBO in men, and VITADOS in teenagers). Results are presented as median (range), and non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests were performed. Results: At a median age of 22.5 (10.2-34.6), 10 patients with nephropathic cystinosis were included (2 supportive therapies, 2 hemodialysis, 6 renal transplantation; 7 females; 2 diabetes, 0 tobacco exposure, 6 patients with a past/ongoing rhGH therapy): 7 out of 10 patients complained of a bone symptom (past of fracture, bone deformations and/or bone pains). Biochemicals and spine DXA did not show any significant abnormalities. Using tibial HR-pQCT, significant decrease in cortical area (81(53-120) vs 116(48-141) mm 2 , p < 0.05) and cortical thickness (850(520-1100) vs 1200(480-1680) \u03bcm, p < 0.05), with a trend towards decreased total volumetric bone mineral density, were observed in cystinosis patients in comparison to controls. There were no differences for trabecular parameters.",

Only 5 of these children (26.3%) had any data about abnormal prenatal USG, neither ADPKD nor PUV patients among them. Conclusions: Neonatal US is a key procedure in early diagnosis of CAKUT and other structural abnormalities of urinary tract even in the cases with normal intrauterine US. For it is safe, easy and cheap one could introduce US screening into routine examination of neonates, especially in regions with poor standard of prenatal care. Introduction: So far, many intronic variants have been detected in genes responsible for inherited kidney diseases.To test the pathogenic nature of these intronic variants, transcript analysis is necessary to see splicing abnormalities caused by these variants. However, mRNA is not usually available and in those cases, it's very difficult to prove these variants as pathogenic and therefore, an alternative strategy should be developed. In this report, we determined the pathogenic nature by both transcript analysis extracted from patients' samples and in vitro assays using minigenes in addition to the in silico analysis using Human Splicing Finder for two patients with inherited kidney diseases. Material and methods: Case 1 is a 35 year-old-man who was pathologically diagnosed with glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits. A novel variant of c.5888 -2A > G (IVS37-2A > G) was detected in FN1 gene by genome DNA sequencing analysis. RT-PCR using mRNA extracted from urine sediments and minigene assays were conducted.Case 2 is a 16 yearold-male who was clinically diagnosed with Lowe syndrome. A variant of c.940-11G > A was detected in OCRL gene (IVS11-11G > A) by genome DNA sequencing. RT-PCR extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and minigene assay was conducted.",

We report a 14 years old patient who was hospitalized to our clinic because of end stage renal disease (eGFR 10,1 ml/min/1,73 m2), and hypertension. Material and methods: The patient history was negative, the physical examination did not show any significant findings. Because of the unknown cause of the ESRD kidney biopsy was performed, and we have collected samples for genetic testing. The result of the kidney biopsy was focal, but dominantly diffuse glomelural sclerosis, with the fusion of the podocyte foot process, and chronic tubolointersticial nephritis. Introduction: PKD-related cellular defects are best understood genetically or in epithelial (cell) models analysing cell proliferation and signalling. Use of primary patient-derived renal epithelial cells provides a unique opportunity to study and quantify cell properties in epithelial function-related assays. Apart from the analysis of differences due to specific mutation, it appears interesting to correlate the severity of the renal disease i.e. GFR or organ size / morphology with alterations in epithelial cell function determined ex vivo. Material and methods: We culture urine-derived renal epithelial cells (URECs) of patients with genetically confirmed causes of PKD, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and nephronophtisis (NPH), and respective controls. Populations of primary cells obtained within 14 days of culture are being characterized by different criteria and tested in 3D cell culture conditions. Using micro-patterned adhesion chips, defined surface shape, size, and extracellular matrix coating allow quantitative analysis of epithelial spheroid formation, a measure of the cells' potential to perform epithelial morphogenesis. Results: URECs from two cohorts of patients (5-6 each) with ARPKD and NPH (mostly NPHP-1 mutation), respectively, are compared in cell culture to generate quantitative characteristics that can be correlated to clinical parameters and progress of PKD. Cells are tested with respect to their proliferation rates, formation of cell-cell junctions in monolayer, induced formation of cilia, and their capacity to build spheroids both in matrigel and when challenged by defined adhesion on chips allowing high content analysis of spheroid properties.",

Conversely, it has been reported that some cases with LAMB2 non-truncating variants tend to show milder phenotypes. Here we report 3 cases with atypically milder phenotypes including 2 siblings and 1 case with typical PS whose LAMB2 variants were detected by next generation sequencing (NGS). We identified biomolecular mechanisms for leading to milder phenotypes in PS. Material and methods: Cases 1-3 are milder cases and have not developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ocular abnormalities nor psychomotor retardation despite they are 4 years, 1 year and 2 years old, respectively. Case 4 showed the typical clinical signs for PS with development of ESRD at 3 months old. All 4 cases were identified LAMB2 pathogenic variants. Molecular study was conducted to clarify the backgrounds that lead to the clinical differences in those cases. Introduction: Our understanding of the genetic factors involved in many conditions is continually evolving, and the availability of genomic testing is rapidly expanding, creating a necessity for new services, new ways of working, and modified professional roles in order to maximise the benefit to patients and families. The multidisciplinary clinic is one model to achieve this and integrate genetics into mainstream medicine.

Therefore, mostly males are affected. In male patients a distinct genotypephenotype correlation could be detected. In female patients with a heterozygous mutation, a variable intrafamilial and interfamilial penetrance exists, resulting in a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from mild microhematuria to severe AS. In these patients genotype-phenotype correlation is less-well described so far. The type of mutation, genetic modifiers or the degree of mosaicism following lyonization of the X chromosome are discussed as possible causes for the phenotypic variability.

X-inactivation in peripheral blood cells as well as in renal progenitor cells/podocytes (urine; kidney tissue if available) will be investigated. III.

Introduction: Nephrocalcinosis (NC) due to inborn metabolic diseases is a very rare condition associated with progression to CKD during childhood. In recent years, multiple monogenic causes of NC have been identified. However, the prevalence of each monogenic gene in children with NC has not yet been studied. The arm of the study was to identify the structure and prevalence of monogenic causes of NC in pediatric cohort. Material and methods: 35 children (29 M/6F) with NC were examined. The median age of patients was 5.0 (IQR: 1.0; 8.0) years. We examined of blood electrolytes levels; urinary excretion of Ca, P, urate (Ur), oxalate. Ultrasound grades (G) of NC were as follows: G1 -mild echogenicity around medullary pyramid borders; G2moderate echogenicity around and inside pyramids; and G3 severe echogenicity of entire pyramids. Genetic analysis was performed in all children using by direct Sanger sequencing in 60%, next generation sequencing in 37.1%, and fluorescence in situ hybridization in 2.9%. Results: We identified 36 causative mutations of 13 inherited kidney diseases with NC, including 13 (36.1%) novel mutations. Most of them was detected in patients with HHRH (38%) ( Introduction: Only 2% of patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) are presented with early clinical manifestations, before 15 years of age. Out of that number, patients rarely present symptoms in perinatal period, which is clinically indistinguishable from Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease. PKD2 gene on chromosome 4q21 is responsible for 15%-20% of all ADPKD and generally has milder clinical presentation and prognosis than ADPKD caused by PKD1 gene. The huge clinical variability of ADPKD has been described within the same family. Material and methods: We ultrasonographically disclosed the female index case with early onset (EO) form of ADPKD whose clinical presentation started from the birth. During her pregnancy in 29th year of life, gynecologist noticed olygohydramnios and polycystic kidneys in fetus. The male premature newborn, was born cyanotic, with big belly and died after 1 h.

At the other hand, some other family members have not been affected or only minimally affected. This newly described mutation of PKD2 gene might be responsible for EOADPKD. In that sense, it would be useful to collect as much patients with EOADPKD as possible and make their genetic analysis in order to check whether they are caused by the same or similar mutations. Introduction: Atypical hemolytic uremic (aHUS) is an ultra-rare mostly genetic complement system disorder leading to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and acute renal injury. It may have a relapsing course leading to end stage renal disease. A variable spectrum of mutations reported in Europe and North America. Treatment with Eculizumab (anti C5 antibody) is promising but needs further studies. This study is the first to investigate molecular genetics of aHUS in Russia. Material and methods: Seventy one children aged 0.5-17 years were included. Diagnosis of aHUS was established by carefull exclusion of other TMA forms. Medical records and blood samples were collected during 3 years term. We investigated CFH, CFI, CFB, MCP and THBD genes mutations by new generation sequencing and CFHR1/CFHR3 deletions by MPLA technique. The case reports of children with aHUS were analyzed to find a possible relation of clinical and laboratory data during the onset and follow up to genetic data and Eculizumab efficacy.",

Introduction: Glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by accumulation of glycogen and fat in liver and kidneys leading to chronic kidney disease. Glomerular hyperfiltration is the first stage of renal dysfunction but tubular abnormalities due to lipid and glycogen accumulation have also been recently described with the apparition of cysts development. This study describes renal dysfunction in GSDI. Material and methods: We studied retrospectively 21 patients with GSDI (median age 22 years ) followed between 1976 and 2016. Renal function was measured with inulin clearance and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all patients.",

Introduction: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal disease. The description of the molecular basis of ADPKD in the last decade has led to the development of promising therapies in adults. Early diagnosis in pediatric patients allows for optimal anticipate therapeutics that could alter the natural history of disease. We review the morbidity of pediatrics patients with ADPKD and we try to identify predictors of renal deterioration.

Mutational analysis of the CLDN16, CLDN19, AE1, ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4 genes was negative. At the age of 16 with targeted next generation sequencing homozygous mutation in CYP24A1 gene (E143del) was detected establishing the diagnosis of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. Conclusions: Our patient had unusual clinical phenotype without hypercalcemic crisis in infancy and laboratory findings suggesting familial hypomagnesemia with hypecalciuria and nephrocalcinosis. The correct diagnosis was established owing to next generation sequencing of the panel of the nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis genes.

Material and methods: We have identified 255 AS and TBMN patients (age range 2-85) by search of patients' records and data registries. From all identified patients, we have collected clinical data regarding family status, gender and age, kidney function (haematuria, proteinuria, chronic renal failure or ESRD), hearing loss and ocular lesions. In all patients kidney biopsy was performed and histological diagnosis of AS or TBMN was made. Genetic counselling for first 11 selected patients (pilot study) was performed in three Croatian hospitals where patients were selected for mutation screening in the COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes by next generation sequencing (NGS). Results: First selected 11 patients (4 males, 7 females, age 3-47) belonged to 7 unrelated families. Four families had a mutation in the COL4A5 gene, one in COL4A3 gene and one had digenic COL4A3 and COL4A4 mutations. In one patient mutation was not found.

Although most of them were treated with oral cysteamine and symptomatically, the specific therapy was delayed, limited in time and dose and/or not correctly monitored. All of them have characteristic NC extrarenal complications. In contrast, the 2 youngest patients at the age of 6.1 and 8.6 years who are treated according to recommendations show normal growth and renal function. Unfortunately NC patients have still limited access to cysteamine eye drops and suffer from ocular problems.",

Genetic mutation can be detected in nearly 25% of the patients with SRNS. Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency-6 (COQ10D6) is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder due to COQ6 mutation. The main clinical manifestations are infantile progressive nephrotic syndrome leading to ESRD and sensorineural deafness. Material and methods: Herein, we report a girl diagnosed SRNS and sensorineural deafness with a COQ6 mutation. Results: A 9 year old girl was admitted to our hospital for genetic evaluation due to SRNS. She was diagnosed with SRNS at the age of seven and audiologic work-up revealed bilateral sensorineural deafness. Renal biopsy specimen demonstrated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Cyclosporine was administered after the renal biopsy. There was no response to cyclosporine therapy. Cyclosporine was discontinued and mycophenolate mofetil was added to the therapy. Despite immunosuppressive therapy, serum creatinine was increased and hemodialysis was indicated one year after disease onset. Living-donor kidney transplantation was performed at the eighth month of hemodialysis. Genomic DNA material, isolated from peripheral blood sample, analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing technology by Ion Torrent, with in-house designed panel-gene kit, embracing 30 nephrotic syndrome genes, covering all the coding regions, exon-intron boundaries and un translated regions Introduction: Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited disease characterized by excessive wasting of renal tubular magnesium and calcium, bilateral nephrocalcinosis and progressive renal failure. FHHNC is associated with mutations in CLDN16 and CLDN19. Material and methods: We describe a case of a well grown 11 year old boy with night blindness since childhood, born to consanguineous parents from rural South India. He has an 18 year old sister with night blindness who is otherwise asymptomatic. He presented with a 3 week history of anasarca and was noted to have CKD stage-V with signs of severe acidosis, hypertension and fluid overload. At a local hospital, investigations revealed bilateral obstructive renal calculi for which bilateral DJ stents were inserted and he was given 3 sessions of haemodialysis. On admission to our unit, he had the following laboratory findings:Creatinine-11.3 mg/dl, BUN-77 mg/ dl, PTH -207.6 pg/ml and Bicarbonate -9.1 mmol/lt. Due to renal failure, he had hypocalcaemia-8.3 mg/dl and hypermagnesaemia-3.1 mg/dl. A 24 h urine oxalate/creatinine ratio was normal; however he had hypercalciuria (0.23 mg/mg). Renal ultrasound showed bilateral slightly small sized kidneys, Grade III renal parenchymal changes, medullary nephrocalcinosis and non-obstructive calculi. ECHO was normal. Ophthalmological examination done in view of night blindness revealed features of retinitis pigmentosa. Blood tests for the mutations in the CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes have been sent and results are awaited.",

Addressing psychosocial factors is important to achieve better outcomes. Introduction: Neurological symptoms may be related to abnormalities in the structure or function of cortical neurons resulting from SMARCAL1 gene expression disorders (ischemic lesions, edema?). Material and methods: Authors describe the case of currently 11-year old girl with Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia with confirmed SMARCAL 1 gene mutation. Nephrotic range proteinuria with FSGS has been detected at the age of 4.5 y. Immunosuppression was ineffective and she started peritoneal dialysis at age of 8 y. Apart from kidney disease with severe hypertension, hypothyroidism, hypostature with osseous deformations, recurrent pericarditis and immunodeficiency the girl presents also recurrent neurological symptoms. Results: In February 2017 she rapidly deteriorated. In a few hours the child became sleepy, without logical contact, anxious, with pointless movements, and progressively confused. Neurological examination confirmed stiffness of the neck, lack of verbal communication. Right-side pyramid syndrome (Lovett III) was identified. Taking into account the clinical course and data on neurological symptoms in the Schimke syndrome available in the literature, the association of current neurological disorders with direct CNS infection was less likely. In the medical history, the girl had previous headache (beginning before 2013), diplopia episode with symptoms of dysarthria (2014, cerebrospinal fluid test -normal result), symptoms of right-sided paresis (2016). The onset of current neurological symptoms was associated with dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia Na:126 mmol/l). On MRI examination smoothing of cerebral gyri of the left brain hemisphere with thickening of the cortex of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes and right frontal area, narrowing of the subarachnoid space were found. The EEG record revealed numerous generalized, left side localized delta waves. The consultant neurologist recommended the introduction of valproic acid. Introduction: \"Hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome\" (HCS) and \"2p21 deletion syndrome\" are two recessive contiguous gene deletion syndromes associated with cystinuria. The deletions differ in size and number of genes involved. HCS is characterized by hypotonia, failure to thrive, severe growth retardation, growth hormone deficiency, characteristic facial dysmorphy and cystinuria. 2p21 deletion syndrome presents with HCS features in addition to mental retardation and respiratory chain complex deficiency. In HCS, SLC3A1 and PREPL genes are disrupted, while in 2p21 deletion syndrome, two additional genes (C2orf34 and PM1B) are deleted. Mutations in SLC3A1 cause cystinuria. The extended phenotypes are attributed to PREPL and C2orf34 PM1B deletions. HCS is described in 17 families, 2p21 syndrome only in one Bedouin family. An intermediate phenotype, resulting from deletion of SLC3A1, PREPL and C2orf34 has been reported twice and known as \"atypical HCS\". We describe a new case of \"atypical HCS\" and his genotype-phenotype correlation. Material and methods: We report the case of a 4-years-old girl from Libya with consanguineous parents. She presented generalized hypotonia and failure to thrive and developed severe growth and developmental delay. She showed cranial dysmorphy with pale scale, long face, bitemporal narrowing, frontal bossing, turned up nose, tented upper lip and slight ptosis. Brain MRI was normal, renal ultrasound revealed nephrocalcinosis and corraliform lithiasis. Urine amino acid chromatography confirmed cystinuria. Blood analysis showed low IGF-1 and elevated lactates. Because of this suggestive phenotype we explore a genomic imbalance by array-cgh in chromosome 2p21.",

Mutation in the NUP160 gene has not been described in early onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and FSGS so far. We described the clinical courses of three Saudi patients with early onset FSGS with novel mutation in this gene. Material and methods: We described three siblings of consangious parents.The first patient was eight years old girl who presented with hypertension and proteinuria without oedema and found to have urea 34 mmol/l and creatinine 412 micromol/l, her kidney biopsy showed sclerosed glomeruli and severe interstial fibrosis. She required peritoneal dialysis within three months and then she received a living-related kidney transplantation. Her brother was nine years old who had a similar presentation with hypertension and proteinuria, found to have urea 36 mmol/l and creatinine 1064 micromol/l and his kidney biopsy showed severe glomerulosclerosis and interstial fibrosis; he was maintained on chronic hemodialysis. The other brother is six years old and was found to have a 2+ protein in urine dipstick screening and urine protein/creatinine of 119 mg/mmol with normal blood pressure, renal profile and serum Albumin. We did a kidney biopsy for him and it showed FSGS. We sent genetic testings for them. Results: Whole exome sequencing revealed the homozygous splice site mutation c.1179 + 5G > A in intron 8 of the NUP160 gene, which was validated by Sanger sequencing. Both parents were heterozygous carriers. NUP160 is part of the NUP107-160 subcomplex of the nuclear pore complex. Mutations in NUP107 and other nucleoporins, but not NUP160, have been described in FSGS. To our knowledge, this aberration has never been described in the literature.It seems likely this homozygous mutation explained the clinical phenotype of the three siblings.",

It is an inborn developmental defect of the urethra, which may be associated with other congenital developmental disorders. Hypospadias are divided according to meatal location to anterior, middle, posterior, and hypospadias with chordee. The condition has a prevalence of 4-43/10.000 born children, and is most frequently observed in white population, less often in black population, and rarely in Asians and Hispanics.Many cases are of unknown etiology; the condition is most often caused by interaction of genes and multifactorial causes. Material and methods: Within the common genetic practice, we analyse karyotype in boys with hypospadias, no other gene panel associated with hypospadias is assessed routinely in boys with hypospadias in the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, other genes associated with hypospadias have been analysed in clinical trials performed abroad (WT I, SF I, BMP4, HOXA4 and others).Another proof of gene involvement may be deduced from known syndromes usually associated with hypospadias (WTI gene mutations are associated with Denys-Drash and Frasier syndromes), further also ZEB2-associated with Mowat-Wilson Syndrome, with more than 50% of boys suffering from hypospadias. Results: We have examined a boy with hypospadias at our nephrology clinic. Assessment of family history showed the presence of hypospadias in male members of the familyfather's siblings, the boy's father, and also mother's brother suffered from hypospadias.Seven per cent of hypospadias cases are familial; the risk of hypospadias development in brothers is 9-17%. Due to the occurrence of hypospadias in the family, genetic assessment of the whole family has been performed, with a family tree.",

Material and methods: A young child referred with renal cysts on ultrasound and a strong family history of ADPKD was identified, and blood and saliva samples were obtained from the family with written informed consent. High throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to explore the entire PKD1 and PKD2 coding regions extending up to 50 bp into the introns in each direction. SureSelect XT Target Enrichment capture of 2.6 Mb of the genome, including PKD1 and PKD2 was followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq4000. HTS data was mapped to GRCh37 as paired-end libraries using NextGENe software. A BED file was used to ensure mapping to PKD1 and PKD2 excluding their pseudogenes. To remove potential pseudogene contamination of the data, the mutation list was filtered against an in-house database of 90 control HTS datasets and by pairwise blast of PKD1 and relevant pseudogenes.",

Introduction: To rapidly make a diagnosis can be of paramount importance in the rare case of neonatal end-stage kidney disease. Material and methods: We present a girl born at 39 + 1 weeks of gestation to maternal primigravida without consanguinity. The antenatal ultrasounds were normal, including third trimester ultrasounds. She had a birth weight of 2.65 kg. At 21 days of age she presented with lethargy, poor feeding and anuria with the presumed diagnosis of sepsis. She had been breastfeeding well with an admission weight of 3.14 kg. She was intubated and mechanically ventilated and transferred to PICU where she was found to be anuric and hypertensive. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was started on day 22 of life and switched to peritoneal dialysis (PD) on day 25. Since no diagnosis had been made, blood was collected for DNA analysis in the patient and both parents as part of the rapid paediatric sequencing (RaPS) research project. Results: On admission on PICU her plasma creatinine was 504 \u03bcmol/L, urea 30.6 mmol/L and serum albumin 27 g/L. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral large and echobright kidneys, with reduced corticomedullary differentiation and multiple small cysts. Plasma oxalate was measured before dialysis initiation and primary hyperoxaluria was excluded. Given the early onset of renal failure, a genetic cause was suspected and she was recruited to the RaPS project. This showed a de novo heterozygous mutation in the WT1 gene and the diagnosis of Denys Drash syndrome was made.",

Labs revealed hyponatremia (125 mmol/l), hyperkalemia (6,9 mmol/l), metabolic acidosis (7.33; bicarbs 14.6 mmol/l) and hypercalcemia (3.0 mmol/l). Neonatal screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia was negative. Parenteral rehydration with 0.9% saline was started.

Conclusions: Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 presents as failure to thrive, dehydration and typical electrolyte disturbance (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis and/or hypercalcemia) in presence of resistance to aldosterone. Introduction: Hyperoxaluria -increased urinary excretion of oxalate exceeding 0,5 mmol (45 mg)/1,73 m2/24 h. The disease spectrum extends from kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis to end stage renal disease. There are three types of primary hyperoxaluria -different in severity and genetic cause. Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is the most common and severe (80% of the cases), autosomal recessive disease, caused by defect in the Vitamin B6 dependent hepatic peroxisomal enzyme, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). It results in increased synthesis and subsequent urinary excretion of oxalate and deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate in, among others, kidneys and urinary tract. The AGXT gene is located on chromosome 2q37.3. Currently more than 150 mutation have been identified. PH1 patients with inadequate response to conservative treatment, require kidney or combined liver-kidney transplantation.",

In contrast to the more common autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) clinical or biochemical risk markers are not established for the clinically highly variable ARPKD and defining primary end points for clinical interventional trials remains challenging. We have therefore recently established an international ARPKD registry study to gather longitudinal clinical data of a deeply-phenotyped cohort of ARPKD patients to lay the foundation for the development of clinical risk profiles. Material and methods: Clinical courses of ARPKD patients are documented in the international, multicenter, observational study ARegPKD using a web-based approach. The renal phenotype is characterized e.g. by data regarding kidney function and sonographic morphology as well as the symptomatic treatment options. Results: Since start of recruitment in 2013 more than 400 patients from 17 countries have been included with a median follow-up time of 3.4 years (0.1 to 29.3 years). Renal symptoms vary substantially, but hyperechogenic kidneys with decreased or abrogated cortex-medulla differentiation and cysts are observed throughout all age groups. Kidney pole-to-pole-length and total kidney volume, as determined by sonography, increase with age. Interestingly however, height-adjusted pole-topole-length decreases with age, while the ratio of kidney volume to body height remains relatively stable. Renal function shows variable courses depending on the age of presentation. Furthermore, the data suggests an association of larger kidneys with reduced kidney function. Renal survival after 10 years is about 85%, after 20 years about 60%. There is no gender-specific effect.",

Behavioural change is a frequent complication. This study aimed to undertake multi-parametric brain magnetic resonance imaging prior to, during and following completion of high dose prednisolone. Analysis included both anatomical structural assessment as well as cerebral perfusion at all three time points. Material and methods: Three boys and two girls aged 7-12y with relapsing SSNS (1-11 relapses) and no prior history of exposure to drugs other than prednisolone underwent brain imaging at the time of relapse, prior to commencement of high dose prednisolone (T0). Imaging was repeated on D21 of high dose prednisolone (T1) and again once prednisolone had been discontinued (T2). Imaging was performed on a 3 T Philips Achieva scanner. We acquired a whole brain T1 volume 0.9mm 3 MPRAGE for anatomical segmentation (FSL, Oxford, UK).

Renal perfusion and glomerular permeability were assessed by measuring clearance of para-aminohippurate and inulin. Vaso-active hormones (plasma renin activity, aldosteron) and urinary sodium and potassium were also measured. Results: Results: Subjects were grouped into low, normal, and high GFR groups based on reference values obtained from the control group. In the low GFR group hypovolaemia was seen as demonstrated by significantly lower renal plasma flow (p = 0.01), filtration fraction (p = 0.01) and higher UK/UK + UNa (p = 0.03) ratio. In addition, non significant higher plasma renin activity (p = 0.11) and aldosteron (p = 0.09) were also seen in the low GFR group compared to high GFR and normal GFR groups. Conclusions: Conclusion: A subgroup of patients in nephrotic syndrome has a decrease in glomerular filtration, apparently related to functional hypovolaemia which can be detected by an elevated urinary potassium to urinary potassium plus sodium ratio (> 0.5-0.6). In the clinical setting, this group will most likely benefit from albumin administration. born to a non-consanguineous pedigree, who presented at 5 years of age with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis together with poor vision, growth hormone deficiency and seizures.

His current estimated eGFR is 59mls/min/1.73 m2 with urine albumin/creatinine ratio measuring 834 mg/mmol with his medications consisting of angiotensin receptor blockade. SOD is characterized by the presence of two or more of the following: hypopituitarism with isolated or combined hormone deficiencies, optic nerve hypoplasia and/or midline brain defects including absence of the corpus callosum and septum pellucidum. The pathogenesis of SOD is multifactorial arising from either environmental causes, viral infections and alcohols.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is the common findings under various pathogenic microenvironments, contributing to the progression of various podocyte diseases. Abnormal protein accumulation associated with ER stress in the ER of podocytes produces structural and functional damage in the cells, which in turn leads to podocyte apoptosis and severe proteinuria. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PAN on ER stress and apoptosis in in vitro podocytes. Material and methods: We cultured rat and mouse podocytes and treated with various concentrations of PAN and evaluated ER stress markers by western blotting and apoptosis by FACS and TUNEL assays. Results: PAN treatment increased ER stress markers, such as, ATF6 and caspase-12 at 12 and 24 h, in a dose-dependent manner, which were improved by chemical chaperones, such as, sodium 4phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and TUDCA. PAN also induced podocyte apoptosis significantly in concentration-and time-dependent manners in FACS and TUNEL assays, which were improved by Nox4 siRNA, ATF6 siRNA, and chemical chaperones. LY294002, a PI3kinase inhibitor, exaggerated ER stress and apoptosis significantly. Therefore, PAN induced ER stress, thereafter, increased oxidative stress, subsequently induced podocyte apoptosis by the inhibition of PI3-kinase signaling.",

Introduction: Alport syndrome is an inherited glomerular disease caused by mutations in COL4A3,COL4A4 or COL4A5 encoding the type IV collagen \u03b13,\u03b14, and \u03b15 chains.The relationship between the various genotypes and phenotypes in AS has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we report underlying mutations in a family with Alport syndrome. Material and methods: We had analyzed four siblings(three girls,one boy) presented with hematuria and/or proteinuria. DNA isolation was performed using Qiamp kit from peripheral blood samples and COL4A3,COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes were analyzed with Next Generation Sequencing Multiplicom MASTR(Niel,Belgium) kit with 139 amplicons and sequenced at MISEQ platform. Results: Two sister and brother presented with microscopic hematuria and one girl with proteinuria. Renal functions were normal in all patients and father of the siblings has microscopic hematuria. The mutation detected at COL4A3 was; c.3644_3646delGAGinsAAA/ p.Arg1215_ Gly1216delinsGlnArg and was reported as \"pathogenic\" with a frame change and possible structural abnormality. In addition, the heterozygous variant identified at COL4A4 was c.3979G > A/p.Val1327Met which was reported as having conflicting pathogenicity due to its unknown effect on the glomerular basal membrane. The pathogenic mutation of COL4A3 was present in three sisters but absent in brother.

Introduction: Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is defined as a nephrotic syndrome occurring before 3 months of age. As many as 85% of the cases have a genetic basis for the renal disease and a poor outcome. There are other sydromes where CNS is associated with microcephaly and neurologic symptoms, for example Galloway-Mowat Syndrome, Arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, progressive encephalopathy-hypsarytmia-optic atrophy (PEHO) syndrome, primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency (COQ2 gene mutation) or carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein (CDG) syndrome. The pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is characterised by prenatal development of an abnormally small cerebellum and brain stem, which is caused either by specific gene mutations or it is secondary associated to chromosomal abnormalities, neurodegenerative or neurometabolic disorders. Material and methods: A hypotrofic newborn with perinatal asfyxia, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, microcephaly and facial stigmatisation manifested with CNS in 45. day of life without any reaction to corticotherapy. Later the oedema disappeared, the level of albumine was more than 25 g/l but there was still nephrotic proteinuria. Brain MRI showed the pontocerebellar hypoplasia.",

Introduction: Malaria (M), the first parasitic infection, is sometimes associated with nephrotic syndrome (NS) in tropical areas. Kidney involvement during quartan malaria is represented by immune-complex mediated glomerulonephritis (GN). Generally NS develops several weeks after onset of quartan fever and its clinical course proceeds slowly to endstage kidney disease (ESKD) even after eradication of the infection. Material and methods: A 17-year-old Ugandan boy was transferred in Italy, as part of a humanitarian project, to treat ESKD with onset 13 months before as NS. In Uganda, the patient received steroids and immunosuppressive therapy with poor results and some dialysis sessions. On admission in our department, clinical examination showed a pale, febrile and edematous boy with hypophonesis in the right hemithorax and a malodorous purulent secretion from exit site of central venous catheter.",

There is relative paucity of knowledge on the clinical outcome of idiopathic collapsing FSGS in the paediatric population. We describe the units experience with 4 cases of idiopathic collapsing FSGS in the past 6 years. Material and methods: The case records of 4 paediatric patients with histological diagnosis of collapsing FSGS were reviewed with regards to patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment, clinical course and eventual renal outcome. The primary endpoint for this descriptive review was the progression to end stage renal failure (ESRF). Results: The 4 patients were predominantly males (3:1) . Age of presentation varies from 2.3-12.3 years. The degree of proteinuria at presentation ranges from 2.90 g/L to massive proteinuria (13.9-20.7 g/L) and did not have a correlation to renal outcome. At the time of the review, 3 patients had developed ESRF. All patients had a full virology and immunological work-up done and results returned negative. All were started on prednisolone therapy. Two were late non-responders while the remaining two patients demonstrated steroid resistance right from the start. One patient demonstrated extensive tubulointerstitial injury with more than 50% global sclerosis on the initial renal biopsy performed three weeks into the presentation and developed rapid progression to ESRF. All patients were treated with prednisolone in combination with other immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil or rituximab). Two patients achieved partial remission. The remaining two who presented with elevated serum creatinine at initial diagnosis remained refractory to therapy and progress to ESRF within 3 years from initial presentation (0.08-2.25 years).",

Children aged 0 to 3 years, non-toilet-trained and presenting at the pediatric emergency department with a suspicion of UTI were eligible. Pain and experience of the procedure during transurethral catheterization or urine bag removal were assessed independently by nurses and parents using a questionnaire. The primary outcome was the mean pain score as assessed by the nurse using a visual analog scale (VAS, range of score: 0-10). A non-inferiority margin of 2 points on the VAS was chosen. Results: One hundred patients were included (50 per group). Mean age was 10.2 months \u00b18.2. The mean VAS score assessed by nurses was 1.9 \u00b1 2.1 in the TUC group and 0.9 \u00b1 1.5 in the UBC group. The difference of VAS between the groups was 1.0 point with an upper limit of the unilateral 95% confidence interval of 1.6. The pain assessed by nurses during catheterization was not significantly superior to the pain during urine bag removal. In the TUC group 84.0% of parents and 77.6% of nurses reported that the procedure went well or very well. Conclusions: Transurethral catheterization is not more painful than bag's withdrawal, with a good parental and nurses' experience of the procedure. This should encourage health professionals to follow the actual guidelines recommending to use TUC whose bacteriological superiority is well established.

Introduction: To review the data of children with nephrocalcinosis (NC) concerning aetiology, clinical manifestations, growth and renal function at presentation and outcomes of a paediatric population presented to a nephrology unit in an urban tertiary centre. Material and methods: The records of consecutive children (0-18 years) with NC were reviewed (January 2008-December 2016). Clinical features, aetiology, treatment and outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Thirty five cases of NC were identified, 24 of which alone and 11 associated with nephrolithiasis. The group was constituted mostly of girls (54%). Age at presentation (median 5,7 years) was below 2 years of age in 40%, 31% had between 3 and 9 years and 29% were older than 10 years; mean follow-up was 4,4 years (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . The most common presenting symptom was failure to thrive in the first year of life (43%) and flank or abdominal pain (20%); in 17% NC was an incidental finding and in 6% of patients had a systemic syndromatic disease. Renal function at diagnosis was normal in all children. The most frequent causes of NC were hereditary tubulopathies (26%), prematurity and diuretic use (20%) and iatrogenic, namely vitamin D treatment (9%) (one case with hipophosphatemic rickets); in 6 cases there was no identifiable cause. In a logistic regression analysis, sex, age of presentation and familiar history of NC showed no correlation with NC alone, NC associated with nephrolithiasis or genetic/metabolic aetiology. Conclusions: Despite the small sample, in this study, we confirmed that genetic and/or metabolic disorders are the main cause for NC and urolithiasis. Associated symptoms and comorbidities, such as growth retardation, intestinal absorption, or bone demineralization, should be evaluated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Preterm infants are a special risk population with high incidence of NC. Results: Patients were grouped as those with regressing/disappearing or stable stone disease (Group 1) and those with increasing stone size or requiring surgery (Group 2).

Troponin-T, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-MB were significantly increased. The second episode of cardiac arrest was irreversible to advanced CPR and a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was established to provide cardiac output. Declining cardiac pump function to a near noncontractile state with an ejection fraction below 10% was observed by echocardiography. This persisted during the following days. However, after seven days on the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, the myocardium slowly recovered function.

Stool samples were cultured from 22 (70%) patients and 9 (40%) were positive (5 Enteroaggregative, 4 Enterohemorrhagic E. coli). One patient was diarrhea negative but stool was positive for Enteroaggregative E. coli. Seven (22%) patients had neurologic manifestation. Nineteen patients had dialysis. Nine patients were treated with ECU with the indications of prolonged anuria, severe hematologic involvement and extra-renal complications. When we compare ECU (+) and ECU (\u2212) dialysis patients, maximum LDH value and duration of ICU were higher (p = 0.028, p = 0.021, respectively), red blood cell infusion was lower (p = 0.05) in ECU (+) dialysis patients (Table-1 ). There was no difference between groups for proteinuria, hypertension or eGFR in the last control. Mean duration of follow up was 8 \u00b1 3.5 months (n = 25). Complete renal recovery was achieved in 70% of the patients, hypertension persisted in two cases (8%), proteinuria persisted in 10 cases (40%), none of the patients were on dialysis at the last control. One patient with multi-organ failure and sepsis had died. Introduction: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is an orphan disease with severe relapsing course originating from complement system dysregulation with uncontrolled activation of alternative pathway leading to the production of membrane-attacking complex and consequent damage of endothelium again manifesting with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and renal failure. Treatment with Eculizumab so far is an only pathogenically aimed approach to aHUS. Material and methods: Medical records from 39 hospitals countrywide were analyzed. Molecular genetic analysis was performed using NGS method for CFH, CFI, CFB, MCP, and THBD genes, and MLPA for deletion at CFHR3/R1 locus. Results: We have selected and analyzed data from 71 children with aHUS. Eculizumab was used in 39 children including 20 with and 19 without mutations. Median time of treatment initiation was 4.5 and 2.0 months after the onset correspondingly. In most of the cases at that time the result of genetic study was not yet available. About 50% in each group elevated their GFR 25% and more within 6 months. Eight patients of 9 in the mutation group and 7 of 9 in non-mutation discontinued dialysis. Even if Eculizumab was started after 6 or more months after it onset, 7 patients with mutations markedly (>25%) improved their GFR. None of untreated patients after 6 months on dyalisis (5 children) stopped dialysis. Side effects as allergic angioedema in 2, dilating cardiomyopathy in 1 and non-viral hepatic disorder in 1 were reported. Conclusions: Eculizumab efficacy was compatible in patients with or without mutations, both improved renal function at least 25%. Treatment with Eculizumab despite needs a further study is likely to significantly improve prognosis even if it started months later. It has two anatomical appearances as anterior and posterior. Here, anterior-posterior NCS and left renal vein duplication (LRV) in a 15year-old adolescent who applied due to complaint of macroscopic hematuria was reported. Material and methods: Case: A 15-year-old female patient applied with the complaint of red colored urination for the last 2 days. There was no macroscopic hematuria at the time of application. She had no pain, urinary burning, high fever or vomiting accompanied with this complaint.",

Introduction: Idiopathic hypercalciuria is the most common identifiable cause of calcium kidney stone disease in children. Polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with a genetic susceptibility for the disease. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene is involved in the normal balance among renal calcium, phosphate, protons, and water excretion. The aim of the present study was the investigation of the CaSR gene polymorphisms in children with idiopathic hypercalciuria. Material and methods: The polymorphisms A986S, R990G and Q1011E (exon 7) of CaSR gene were studied in 27 children with idiopathic hypercalciuria and 67 normal children age and gender matched to the patients. The diagnosis of hypercalciuria was based on the urine calcium excretion value of >4 mg/Kg/24 h in two consecutive 24-h urine collections. Children with secondary hypercalciuria were excluded from the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood sample. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis of amplified segments were performed. Results: The frequency of the R990G and Q1011E in the patients did not differ significantly from that of controls (11.1% versus 1.5% and 7.4% versus 10.5% respectively). The A986S polymorphism in either the heterozygosity or the homozygosity state (genotype GT or \u03a4\u03a4) of the CaSR gene was found to be in a significantly higher rate in the patients (59.2%) compared to the controls (26.8%), p < 0.05%. The genotype GT was found in 55.5% of the patients and 25.3% of the controls, and the genotype TT in 3.7% and 1.5% respectively.",

Introduction: Using a proteomic approach, we assessed the differences in the urinary proteins between children with renal stones (RS), and healthy controls (HC), with particular attention to the proteins involved in oxidative stress and tubular injury. Material and methods: Quantitative proteomic comparison of pooled urine from RS (N = 30, 24 females, mean age 12.95 \u00b1 4.03 years) versus age-and gender-matched HC (N = 30), using liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Relative protein abundance was estimated using spectral counting. Proteins of interest were selected using the following criteria: 1) \u22655 spectral counts; 2) \u22652-fold difference in spectral counts; and 3) \u22640.05 p-value for the Fisher's Exact Test. Cytoscape was used to investigate the key nodes of unique proteins. Results: Of the 1813 proteins identified, 230 met the above criteria, with 163 proteins up-regulated in RS group and 67 up-regulated in HC. Function analysis revealed 23 inflammatory proteins, 8 proteins involved in oxidative stress, and 4 involved in tubular injury. Of those, NADPHoxidase, a major source of reactive oxygen species, was only found in RS group, while Glutathione S-transferase, an important antioxidant enzyme, was more abundant in controls (Table) .

Teaching is based around interesting cases, which is important as evidence shows that learning and discussion focused around a \"reallife\" work based problem, is more effective than didactic teaching. Results: Trainees are exposed to varied case-loads depending on local patient populations and this forum allows trainees to share expertise on the wide-ranging spectrum of patients seen across the UK. We also facilitate trainees fulfilling their RCPCH GRID curriculums. Documents are stored on Dropbox and provide trainees a resource to refer to or for those who could not attend. Conclusions: We present our feedback from #kidneyschool and demonstration of a session. We believe this trainee led innovation provides an excellent platform for teaching and education whilst building a successful peer network. Material and methods: nPTECs were isolated from urine samples of neonates of different gestational age (GA) and conditionally immortalized using a temperature sensitive SV40T antigen and human telomerase hTERT. The cell clones were characterized on gene expression level for PTECs markers such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), aquaporin1 (AQP1), and organic cation transport protein 2 (OCT2). In addition, protein expression and functional assessment were performed for P-gp and OCT2. Results: We established 101 clonal cell lines of cinPTECs derived from neonatal urine. Gene expression analysis confirmed the expression of the PTECs (P-gp, AQP1, and OCT2), similar to the expression in the adult control ciPTECs. P-gp was expressed in cinPTECs from the different gestational ages and exhibited similar functionality as the adult derived ciPTECs.

In children the obesity related glomerulopathy (ORG) is not fully understood in children. On the other hand, many congenital and hereditary conditions are associated with obesity are there but not gathered yet in any single study. Obesity and overweight are frequently induced by the interventions needed in pediatric nephrology as well. The purpose of this work is divided to two portions; the first is to review the studies included the effect of obesity on the renal diseases in children. The second portion is to gather all the congenital, hereditary and acquired renal conditions associated with overweight and obesity in children in one systematic review. Material and methods: The obesity related glomerulopathy including the effect of proteinuria, hypertension, nephrolithiasis and kidney cancer were thoroughly reviewed. Extensive search in OMIM; the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man came up with only seven obesity syndromes associated with renal disorders. The acquired obesity induced by the renal conditions intervention in children was categorized to malnutrition, drug-induced, peritoneal dialysis and issues related to hemodialysis and kidney transplantation. Results: The obesity related glomerulopathy is not studied well in children although obese children usually share the same squeals of ORG like adults. The most common of the seven obesity syndromes associated with renal disorders is Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Unless a pediatric dietician with experience in kidney problem is actively involved in the management of kidney diseases, many children will develop malnutrition towards overweight than underweight in developed countries. Glucocorticoid is the most common drug-induced obesity in pediatric nephrology intervention. Peritoneal dialysis and \"Let them eat\" is the beneficial strategy for hemodialysis.

Introduction: CKD is associated with significant morbidity, and mortality. A poor nutritional state can adversely affect its progression, and be reflected in anthropometric measures. Such measurements are poorly characterised outside those with the most severe disease, despite data being recorded and essential to identifying early changes to improve clinical outcome. The aim was to explore the feasibility of producing a report on the prevalence of under and over nutrition in children with CKD. The objectives to use the electronic systems to obtain data and explore relationships with kidney function. Material and methods: Children were identified using clinic codes. The first appointment recorded for weight, height, BMI and creatinine was used. Data was electronically transferred onto a specifically designed database and used to generate z scores and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The prevalence of under and over nutrition was estimated, and the relationship with kidney function explored. Results: 819 children were included. Weight and height were lower in the end stage programme (CKD stage 4-5) compared to general nephrology clinics (CKD2-3) (p = <0.001).

Disparity was found in the emotional domain between self-reported and parent-proxy questionnaires (p = 0.005), but on subgroup analysis by age-group, only remained in those aged 5-7 years (p = 0.046). Analysis of only those receiving conservative management demonstrated a similar pattern. Ten children had received functioning renal transplant. Comparison between those that had a renal transplant and those that did not, did not demonstrate any difference in scores in the self-rated questionnaire, but demonstrated lower parent-proxy scores in those with a graft.",

The reasons for this need exploration, but may be due to populations receiving different healthcare services, and/or the small, relatively homogenous population of this cohort. Parents tended to score their child lower than the child themselves in the emotional domain. This data contradicts previous literature that suggests that discordance should increase with the age. HRQoL tools have the potential to be used to evaluate services, as screening tools, and to identify areas to be explored during consultation. HRQoL assessment should be considered for introduction into clinical care for ongoing holistic care of children with chronic illnesses, including CKD. Introduction: We aimed to assess health related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or a kidney transplant (CKD-T) from the perspective of their parents (proxy ratings). Additionally, the parental life satisfaction was evaluated as well as its possible associations with HRQoL of their children. Material and methods: Sixty parents to children with CKD stage 3-5 or CKD-T participated. HRQoL in children was assessed by parent proxy versions of the generic instruments Kidscreen-27 and Disabkids-37. Parents own life satisfaction was measured by self-reported LiSat-11questionnaire.",

Introduction: Despite the variety of pathogenetic mechanisms of damage of renal tissue, the consequences of all these processes lead up to the formation of nephrosclerosis with the development of renal failure. The purpose of the study is to develop an algorithm for early diagnosis of the extent of kidney damage based on data of correlation analysis of morphometric changes. Material and methods: Material for the research included 29 specimens of renal tissue of children. Seventeen of them were obtained using in vivo biopsies and 12 autopsies from children suffering from kidney diseases at the age from 3 months to 16 years. All the children suffered from obstructive uropathy, the duration of illness in 70% of them were more than a year. At the statistical processing of the received materials the package of applied programs Statistica 10.0 in Windows 2010 are used.

Early indicators of renal parenchyma damage include: the presence of degeneration and/or tubular atrophy, lymphohistiocytic infiltration, angiomatosis of blood vessels. To more pronounced changes in the kidney tissue, to the early changes included: thinning of the parenchyma and thickening of the blood vessels walls. And the most severe pathological changes is the progression of atrophy, sclerosis of tubules, glomeruli, renal vessels with impaired cortical and medulla differentiation of the kidney substance. Statistical analysis are revealed correlations of different strength and direction of the morphometric criteria of nephrosclerosis with the degree of development of degenerative changes of glomeruli, tubules, vessels with outcome in sclerosis. Comparing the data of the statistical study of correlation and morphometric changes, there are 3 successive stages of development of nephrosclerosis. Conclusions: Statistics in medicine is one of the tools for the evaluation of experimental data and clinical observations. On the basis of statistical analysis the classification of nephrosclerosis stages are proposed with the indication the extent and depth of the renal lesions at the histomorphological study.

Introduction: To report the successful outcome of a staged surgical approach with bilateral native nephrectomies, haemodialysis and living related donor (LRD) renal transplantation in an infant with bilateral intrarenal aneurysmal disease secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) to avert the life-threatening risk of aneurysmal rupture. Material and methods: Retrospective 12 month post-transplant follow up data of a 2 year old boy with FMD who presented at 7 months of age with macroscopic haematuria (after aneurysmal bleeding) and renovascular hypertension (presenting systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 250 mmHg at 7 months) requiring five anti-hypertensive agents with normal renal function. Multi-disciplinary team discussions led to a planned surgical approach in view of intra-renal aneurysm size (1.5 cm) and the lifethreatening risk of rupture. He underwent bilateral native nephrectomies with histology confirming FMD, followed by haemodialysis with reduction to one anti-hypertensive agent. Three months later weighing 12 kg, he proceeded to LRD renal transplant from his mother (mismatch 1,1,0) with anastomosis of the renal artery and vein onto his aorta and inferior vena cava respectively. He underwent excisions of inferior mesenteric artery and right internal iliac artery aneurysms without complications. Results: 12 months post-transplant; he is on triple immunosuppression, normotensive with SBP of 104 mmHg and off all anti-hypertensive agents. He has had no biopsy-proven acute rejection nor significant infectious complications and has had no proteinuria nor donor specific antibodies. His renal allograft function remained stable (eGFR of 74mls/min/1.73m 2 ).

Patients with a complete pneumococcal vaccination status had numerically less lower respiratory tract infections during the first three years post-transplant than children without vaccination or with an incomplete status (16.4% vs. 27.7%, p = 0.081). Altogether, vaccine-preventable diseases post-transplant occurred 4.7-fold more frequently in unvaccinated (14/17, 82.4%) than in vaccinated patients (3/17, 17.6%) . By multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with an incomplete vaccination status were non-Caucasian ethnicity (OR 9.21, p = 0.004), chronic dialysis treatment before transplantation (OR 6.18, p = 0.001), and older age at transplantation (OR 1.33, p < 0.001) ( Table 1) .

Introduction: Exosomes are lipid membrane-bound nanoparticles (40-150 nm of size) released from different cells type. They could carry different types of cargo (e.g. miRNA, proteins) that reflect the physiopathological status of the cells and/or organ they originated from. For instance, the exosomes present in the urine called Urinary Exosomes (UExs) arise from all the different nephron cells. Thus, an accurate characterization of their content could be helpful to identify novel reliable non-invasive biomarkers for kidney allograft injury. However, due to their low amount, UExs concentration and characterization remain a challenge. This study aims to identify the most efficient UExs isolation method both for RNA profiling and proteomic analysis to discover novel renal transplant rejection biomarkers. Material and methods: UExs were isolated from urine samples using four different methods: three commercial kits (Norgen, ExoQuick and Qiagen) and the ultrafiltration. UExs were quantified by qNano. Total RNA, included small RNA species, was extracted using column kit. Biochemical assay was applied to extract proteins. The miRNA and proteins integrity and concentration were evaluated by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.",

Introduction: Chronic inflammation is mostly linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with progression of renal disease, cardiovascular disease and poor outcome. Renal transplantation (RTx) may improve this condition whereas it may also contribute to inflammation via oxidative stress due to ischemia reperfusion injury, acute rejection, graft dysfunction, hypertension and increased body mass index. In the present study, we evaluated inflammatory status in pediatric RTx recipients. Material and methods: A total of 24 RTx patients (17 males, aged between 5.0-18.6 years) with a functioning kidney [median (IQR) of eGFR; 66.5 (27) ml/min/1.73m 2 ] were enrolled in the single-center study. Control group consisted of 12 age, gender and eGFR similar patients with CKD. For the assessment of inflammatory status, Pentraxin-3, IL-6 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA method. Routine biochemical parameters and high sensitive (hs)-CRP were recorded from the patients' file. Twenty-four hour MAP was also recorded from the last ABPM within 6 months. Patients who had a 24-h MAP \u2265 2SDS were defined as hypertensive.",

Tacrolimus is one of the major immunsupresive agents and fluctuations of blood levels may lead to antibody development. The aim of the study was to investigate whether tacrolimus variability is an effective factor for antibody development and graft survival in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Material and methods: Pediatric living-donor renal transplant recipients followed-up at our center at the last two years and who were using tacrolimus were retrospectively evaluated. Patients who had pretransplant donor spesific antibodies (DSA) were excluded. Tacrolimus blood levels, serum creatinine and DSA were recorded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were calculated using Schwarz formula. Tacrolimus variability (Tac CV = standard deviation of mean/mean) was calculated separately at the first post-transplant 6 months, between 6 and 12 months and from the end of the first year to the last follow-up period.

Despite treatment with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the kidney function further declined over 2 years, and hemodialysis was started at the age of 14 years. She received a cadaveric transplant at 17 years and we chose an immunosuppressive treatment including one IV steroid pulse of 500 mg/m2, oral steroids over 3 months, tacrolimus, MMF and eculizumab (8 infusions over the first 2 months post-transplant). Biological follow up was done with weekly complement C3 level analysis and proteinuria. There was complete terminal complement pathway inhibitionno proteinuria recurred and eculizumab treatment was discontinued after 2 months. Protocol kidney biopsies were performed at M1, 4, and 11 without signs of disease recurrence. Graft function remained normal and proteinuria negative after eculizumab discontinuation. Conclusions: Eculizumab might be an interesting tool to prevent disease recurrence post-transplant in patients with DDD.

Risk taking behaviours and disengagement from the medical team is common, therefore delivering advice can be challenging. Many of these patients will never have received contraception advice before and many find the prospect of talking about it embarrassing and daunting. Providing appropriate advice can often be challenging due to co-existing learning difficulties. Our objective was to assess whether adolescents within the young adult transplant service had received accurate advice on contraceptive and pregnancy transplant safety. Material and methods: We designed and distributed patient experience questionnaire to all patients within the renal young adult service who had a functioning transplant. This focused upon two main issues: advice they had been given regarding contraception and the risks of pregnancy and current use of contraceptives. We also asked for their opinions of how to improve the information provided. Results: Nine responses were received from this small patient group. Only 55% had received contraceptive advice since transplant, with 67% wanting more information relating to contraceptive choices. Only 22% had received contraceptive advice at their paediatric centre. Only 55% of patients had received advice regarding pregnancy and transplant.

Introduction: Hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in the clinical setting in hospitalized patients. Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the leading cause of hyponatremia in most of the cases. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin type-2 receptor antagonist used for treatment of hyponatremia due to cirrhosis and congestive heart failure. There is limited data about tolvaptan usage in children for treatment of SIADH in the literature. Here we present an adolescent case of idiopathic SIADH that is treated successfully with tolvaptan. Sixteen year-old, female patient admitted with the complaint of headache and nausea. Physical examination and medical history was unremarkable. She was found to have hyponatremia (Na:110 mmol/l), hypochloremia (89 mmol/l), hypouricemia (1,4 mg/dl) with normal renal function tests, electrolytes and normal blood gas analyses. Serum osmolality was 276 ng/ml and urine osmolality was 565 ng/ml. Fractional excretion of Na was 1.9% with urine sodium level of 173 mmol/l, tubular phosphorus re-absorption was 78% and uric acid excretion rate was 834 mg/1.73 m2/d. She did not have any signs of dehydration and urine output was normal. Serum ADH levels during hyponatremia was also found to be decreased; 8.3 ng/mL. Her clinical and laboratory findings, led us to the diagnosis of SIADH. She didn't respond well to fluid restriction. Thus, Tolvaptan was started on the second week at a dose of 0.28 mg/kg (15 mg/d) once a day and titrated down. Her response to treatment was perfectly well without any side effects. Treatment was continued for 2 weeks. In conclusion, tolvaptan is a safe treatment and it should be emphasized that tolvaptan could be an effective treatment option for refractory cases with careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status of the patient. Results: Case I A 2-month-old boy, was admitted to our clinic with the complaints of upper respiratory tract infection. He was the first born child of consanginous parents. Laboratory findings revealed hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis was detected on abdominal ultrasound. His ophthalmologic examination was unremarkable. With hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, patient was considered to have FHHNC. Oral magnessium supplementation was initiated. Four years of follow-up has been completed uneventfully. Case II A 6-day-old term male infant was admitted with seizure. The patient was resistant to calcium and anticonvulsant drugs and the seizure activity could only be controlled after magnesium infusion. His parents were consanguineus and his 4-year old brother was being followed due to hypercalciuria by the pediatric nephrology department. Biochemistry profile revealed hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Calcium extraction was 11 mg/kg/day. Medullary nephrocalcinosis was reported on renal ultrasound. His eye examination, echocardiography, transfontanel ultrasound and electroencephalography were normal. Due to the triad of hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, and the medical history of his elder brother, he was diagnosed with FHHNC. After correction of the electrolyte abnormalities, he was discharged from hospital and is currently being followed-up without any problem.",

CKD evokes structural and functional cardiac changes such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), LV dilatation, LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Restoration of renal function after renal transplantation (RTX) disrupts the negative cardiorenal interplay and may reverse some of the cardiac changes seen with CKD. We presented the patients with high cardiovascular risk and the success of renal transplantation on the cardiac functions. Material and methods: Eleven RTX patients who had severe cardiac risk were evaluated by echocardiography before and after renal RTX. Left ventricular diastolic diameter, sistolic diameter, ejection fraction (%) were assesed by echocardiographic standart parameters.

Infants <10 kg of body weight, however, represent a small patient group which is often not considered suitable for RTx. The objective of this retrospective, matched cohort study is the comparison of short-term outcomes (for 2 years post-transplant) in low-weight children (<10 kg) and in a control group of children with 10-15 kg body weight at time of engrafting in order to refute or confirm the common current weight threshold (10 kg) for paediatric RTx. Material and methods: We conducted a multicentre, retrospective cohort study on paediatric renal transplant recipients with a body weight below 10 kg at RTx (low-weight group, n = 38) compared to a matched control group (cases matched with two controls each) with a body weight of 10-15 kg at RTx (control group, n = 76) from data entered into the Cooperative European Paediatric Renal Transplant Initiative (CERTAIN) Registry. RTx from non-heart beating donors and AB0-incompatible transplantations were excluded. The matching criteria were as follows: (1) primary renal disease group (defined by risk of potential recurrence of primary renal disease and/or systemic organ impairment), (2) graft source (living or deceased donor), (3) immunosuppressive therapy (including calcineurin-inhibitor (cyclosporine microemulsion or tacrolimus), antiproliferative agent (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine) with or without corticosteroids, and antibody induction therapy), and (4) number of HLAmismatches (with a maximum difference of 1). Outcome variables were categorized as follows: (i) variables related to transplant surgery and the immediate postoperative period, (ii) transplant function (eGFR), (iii) number of treated acute rejection episodes (ARE) and (iv) transplant-related viral infections",

The following diagnostic characteristics were compared among the 3 groups: demographic data, family history, age, growth, biochemical values, hearing assessment and image studies. Results: The three groups were not different in sex, ethnicity, severity of acidosis, growth retardation and the presence of nephrocalcinosis. Patients having mutations in SLC4A1 presented later onset (median and interquartile range) than the other two groups: 120 (45) months versus 7.50 (30) months and 3 (12) months in ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4, respectively.

Material and methods: We present four pediatric cases with unusual forms of thrombotic microangiopathy in the frame of systemic diseases. Results: Case 1: 5 years old, acute pancreatitis with complement activation and HUS-triad (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure). Early treatment with Eculizumab results in rapid hematological and renal remission. MRI shows anatomic variant (pancreas divisum) associated to high risk of spontaneous pancreatitis. Recurrence of pancreatitis under treatment with Eculizumab, with no signs of TMA. Genetic analysis shows risk haplotypes in CHF, MCP and CFHR3-CFHR1 deletion. Pancreatitis triggered aHUS or vice versa? Case 2: 2 years old, acute myeloid leukemia M5, after haploidentical BMT, complete chimerism. After BMT develops transfusion-dependent anemia, malignant hypertension and proteinuria. Transitory stabilization after suspension of cyclosporine. Progressive disease with two-fold increase of creatinine, renal biopsy shows TMA. Under treatment with Eculizumab normalization of blood pressure and renal function, no proteinuria. Hemoglobin recovery, no need for transfusions. Material for genetic testing from saliva (blood cells from donor), result pending. Case 3: 15 years old, previously healthy, presents with cholestasis and HUS-triad. Ocular evaluation shows Keyser-Fleischer Ring. Copper in urine and low ceruloplasmin confirm diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Hemolytic anemia only better under treatment with Trientine. Progressive recovery of hemoglobin and renal function. Marked complement activation, CFB-Antibodies and CFHR5 variant. Case 4: 10 years old, Wilson's disease. Three years after liver transplantation presents HUS-triad in the frame of viral infection.

The extrarenal involvements in aHUS are being increasingly characterized in the literature and occur up to half of all patients. In this study we aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic features and treatment of pediatric aHUS patients with gastrointestinal involvement. Material and methods: Clinical features of aHUS patients were obtained from the Turkish national aHUS registry. Results: This study included 170 children from the national aHUS Registry. The number of the patients with extraranal manifestations are 68 (23 male and 45 female). The most common type of extra-renal involvement of aHUS was neurological system involvement (n = 45 [66.2%]), followed by gastrointestinal (n = 19 [27.9%]), cardiovascular (n = 10 [14.7%]), and respiratory (n = 10 [14.7%]) involvement.Mean age was 7.9 years (2.5-14.7) in patients with gastrointestinal manifestations.Among the gastrointestinal manifestations, the most common clinical features were gastrointestinal hemorrahage in 4 patients, pancreatitis in 3 patients, non-bloody diarrhoea at presentation in 3 patients, epigastric pain in 3 patients, elevated liver enzyes in 2 patients, persistent vomiting in 2 patients, invagination in 1 patient, ischemic hepatitis in 1 patient and cholelithiasis in 1 patients. Of these 19 patients, 13 patients had other system involvement including neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Five patients with multisystem involvement died during the fallow-up. The genetic analyses revealed Factor H mutation in two patients and C3 mutation in one patient. The complement mutation analysis is under investigation in other patients.The patients were treated with eculizumab, with or without plasmapheresis/plasma infusion.Conclusions:In this study we demonstrated a rare manifestation of pediatric aHUS patients with gastrointestinal involvement. The results of this registry can give important clues about the rare manifestations of the disease and this can improve the diagnosis, management and prognosis of aHUS patients.P-252 RENAL INVOLVEMENT IN GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE TYPE I: A CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY Dolomanova Olga, Ene Lavina, Lemoine Sandrine, Fouilhoux Alain, Guffon Nathalie, Champagnac Jean, Dubourg Laurence Exploration Fonctionnelle R\u00e9nale, Groupement Hospitalier Edouard Herriot, Hospices Civils De Lyon, France",

As of 2015, the NAPRTCS has data on over 19,000 children with CKD, on dialysis and with renal transplants. Cystinosis is a rare genetic disease. There are little data on outcomes of CKD, dialysis and kidney transplantation in cystinosis pts. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of NAPRTCS database of registered cystinosis pts. with CKD, dialysis and renal transplant. Data on cystinosis pts. are compared to other pts. in NAPRTCS registry who have non-recurrent, ie non-immunologic forms of potential graft loss. Specific aims were to describe the natural history of cystinosis, to investigate potential differences in CKD, dialysis and transplant pts. Results: CKD data from 117 cystinosis pts. were compared to 2109 pts. with CKD from other causes. There was a statistical significance in growth delay in cystinosis pts. and use of growth hormone (rGH). Cystinosis pts. have significantly lower blood pressure (BP), poorer height Z-score, lower calcium, phosphate and higher alkaline phosphatase levels. Cystinosis pts. progressed to ESRD faster than other pts. with CKD. There were no statistically significant differences in gender, serum creatinine, bicarbonate, PTH level, anemia and erythropoietin use. Dialysis data from 95 cystinosis pts. were compared to 1472 dialysis pts. from other causes. There was statistical significance in BP, height and weight Z-score, growth deficit, the use of rGH, calcium and PTH levels. Dialysis survival was better in cystinosis pts. There is no statistical difference in gender, dialysis modality, anemia, erythropoietin use, albumin, phosphorus level and time to transplant while on dialysis. Data obtained from 231 transplant pts. with cystinosis vs. 2844 other causes, revealed statistical significance in height and weight Z-scores. There was no statistical difference in gender, graft survival, donor source (LRD vs. DD), preemptive transplant, time to first rejection, number of transplants. Conclusions: CKD and dialysis cystinosis pts. differ from other CKD and dialysis pts. Cystinosis pts. progress to ESRD faster than other pts., growth deficit in cystinosis pts. is significantly worse and rGH is more commonly used. Calcium and PTH levels are lower and alkaline phosphatase is higher in CKD cystinosis pts. Dialysis survival in cystinosis pts. is better.

An optimal balance of EC survival and CNI effect was obtained with CsA 10 mcg/ml for 24 h. CsA led to upregulation of CD46, CD55 and CD59, and decereased CFH surface cofactor activity. Scratch wound healing over 6 h was significantly impaired by CsA. Conclusions: CsA causes dose-and time-dependent increase in complement activation on EC with increased cell death and impaired repair. This effect was enhanced by serum starvation and by anti-CD59 antibody. We found that CsA led to decreased surface CFH cofactor activity and upregulation of surface-bound complement regulators CD46, CD55 and CD59. Our findings suggest a role for CsA-induced, complementmediated EC injury.Introduction: Although similar factors play a role in both postrenal transplant anemia (PTA) and anemia in CKD patients, additional mechanisms regarding immunosuppressive medications, antimicrobial drugs, episodes of rejections and altered inflammatory milieu exist in pathogenesis of PTA. The present study aimed at elucidating risk factors of PTA and comparing anemia and inflammation related parameters in RTx and CKD patients. Material and methods: Of the enrolled 68 participants in our singlecentered, cross-sectional study, 48 were RTx, who were transplanted before 18 years of age. The other 20 participants were with CKD and comparable to RTx group in terms of age, gender and eGFR. Data on primary renal disease, mode and duration of dialysis, donor and transplant properties, list of medications and certain laboratory findings were collected from patient records. Serum levels of erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin-25, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The ratio of EPO to Hgb was calculated to estimate endogenous EPO resistance. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of standard triple therapy with prednisolone, CNI and purine antagonists in 42 patients. Nine patients were on antiviral treatment. Results: One thousand fifty kidney transplant recipients (males 59%, median age at transplantation 13.2 years, preemptive transplantation 23%, median dialysis duration 18 months) have been included.",

            "text": "Introduction: Central blood pressure (cBP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) have not previously been reported in children with Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The aim of this study was to measure BP components[peripheral BP (pBP)  and cBP], carotidfemoral PWV (PWVcf), indexed left ventricular mass (LVMI) and microalbuminuria in children with ADPKD. This study found that children with ADPKD have higher peripheral and central BP than healthy children. We observed no evidence of increased arterial stiffening although children with ADPKD had higher LVMI and microalbuminuria than healthy children. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms of elevated BP in children with ADPKD and its influence on the evolution of target organ damage. Anthropometric data, medical personal/familial history and drug intake were collected at enrollment from all patients and healthy controls. A specific questionnaire on bone health, including previous fractures or bone deformities was performed. Blood and spot urine samples were collected from all participants. In a subgroup, a X-ray of the left hand and a dual-energy X-ray-absorption (DXA) were performed. Results: We included 92 children with ADPKD and normal renal function (52 males, mean \u00b1 SD age: 10.2 \u00b1 5.0 years) and 22 healthy controls (10 males, mean \u00b1 SD age: 10.3 \u00b1 4.1). Patients had significantly lower serum phosphate levels compared to healthy controls. Low TmP/GFR was observed in 24% of patients. Serum FGF23, PTH, calcitriol and Klotho levels did not differ between patients and healthy controls.Remarkably, ADPKD patients showed depressed bone alkaline phosphatase levels, suggesting low bone formation.Conclusions: This is the first report highlighting bone formation anomalies in early ADPKD stages. We demonstrated hypophosphatemia in combination with renal phosphate leak in ADPKD children with normal eGFR with an inappropriately high FGF23 and normal Klotho levels.Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and to investigate potential clinical consequences.Introduction: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare genetic condition that causes cysts to develop in the liver and kidneys. It is usually first diagnosed in infancy and affects approximately 1 in 20,000 live births. It is distributed amongst boys and girls and can cause death in the first month of life. As the condition has multisystem effects, a comprehensive care strategy requires a multidisciplinary team and detailed data collection.This abstract describes data collected by the ARPKD Rare Disease Group via the National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases (RaDaR) in the UK. Material and methods: Data is entered retrospectively from the patient's medical records following consent. The dataset is defined by the UK Renal Registry in association with over 20 Rare Disease Groups, made up of experts in each eligible condition. Data fields include demographics, blood and urine results, medications, transplant and dialysis history, genetics and co-morbidities. The inclusion criteria are open to all ARPKD patients including Congenital Hepatic Fibrosis and Caroli Syndrome with kidney malformation or cyst allowing comparisons between a long-term survivor subset and a cohort that included both neonatal survivors. Results: 108 ARPKD patients from 31 UK renal units have been consented to date with an age range of 1 week to 65 years. Introduction: Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein Purpura Nephritis (HSPN) progression to ESRD reached 20% in old series. In 2015 ESPN supported the European Registry on biopsy proven HSPN in children.Material and methods: Aim of the retrospective Registry is the identification of progression risk factors in children diagnosed and followed since 1995. The analysis on 203 children enrolled so far indicates a substantially improved prognosis. No renal histology was predictive of remission. Analysis of treatments modalities is expected to enlight the possible role in achieving better outcome.Introduction: Data on recovery of renal function after chronic dialysis at paediatric age are scarce. We examined the incidence of recovery of renal function and its potential determinants in a large cohort of paediatric dialysis patients in Europe. Material and methods: Data of 6597 patients commencing dialysis at an age of 15 years or younger between 1990 and 2014 were extracted from the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry. Recovery of renal function was defined as discontinuing dialysis for 30 days or more. We used a cumulative incidence competing risk approach and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models to study time to recovery. was detected in 76 infants, and 18 infants had severe hypercalcemia with ionized calcium of >1.49 mmol/L. Symptoms ranged from nonsymptomatic to reduced appetite, vomiting, irritability and failure to thrive. Treatment included hydration and dietary restriction of calcium and vitamin D3 in the milder cases and the more severely affected infants received additional potassium citrate, calcitonin, prednisolone and bisphosphonate. Despite of this severe nephrocalcinosis was seen.Conclusions: This outbreak illustrates the challenges of categorizing a potentially toxic substance as food supplement instead of registered pharmaceutical. The close cooperation between health authorities, academic societies and the press was crucial in the acute phase identifying and treating all infants at risk.O-80 USE OF HERBAL AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS IN CHILDREN WITH KIDNEY AND URINARY TRACT DISEASETugba Tastemel Ozturk, Elif Ozmert, Nuray Kanbur, Bora Gulhan, Fatih Ozaltin, Rezan Topaloglu, Ali D\u00dczova Hacettepe University Faculty Of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey Residential areas and the educational status of the parents had no significant effects. In both patient and control groups, main information sources for HDS were the friends-relatives and the internet; 12% had first acquired information for HDS from a healthcare professional. Among HDS users, 59% do not share with their doctors that they use these products; and 92% are aware of that HDS may have side effects.Conclusions: Considering possible side effects, the use of HDS should be questioned on routine visits in all patients, with a special focus on the ones with longer disease duration and total length of stay in hospital, and higher number of drugs used. Two years on, we undertook an evaluation of the resource to understand the potential for improving patient and family experience and opportunities for further development.Material and methods: We used Google Analytics to assess 'hits' on the infoKID website in the UK and worldwide. We held focus groups and clinic chats with 53 families and feedback from healthcare professionals to devise questionnaires that were piloted prior to developing the definitive surveys made available online in October 2016. 86%) of PPC familiar with the site reported preferred times of accessing information at diagnosis and with changes in the condition.",

Therapeutic drug monitoring studies of MMF suggest that area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values of MPA may be associated with clinical outcome in adults with lupus but data in children is scarce.Conclusions: Therapeutic drug monitoring leading to individualized dosing may improve the efficacy of MMF. An AUC of MPA >45 mg.h/L is associated with a better response rate and migt be considered as a target value in pediatric lupus nephritis. years were included in three French pediatric nephrology centres. There were 71 patients in the oral drugs group, 27 in the RTX group and 12 in the oral drugs and RTX group. 13.6% of patients had a steroid resistant form of INS (9.9% in the oral drugs group and 18.5% in the RTX group). The number of re-Quality of life in patients with oral and IV treatment in patients with severe forms of INS is not different. The treatment choice should include the opinion of the patient and his/her family. Neither clinical nor QOL parameters are sufficient to decide for or against RTX treatment.Results: Complement activation resulted in PM insertion of C5b-9 pores in control and VWD BOECs resulting in rapid Ca 2+ influx. In response, VWF was recruited to the EC surface via WPBs merging with the PM and releasing VWF multimers within 30-60 min. Importantly, control but not VWD BOECs resealed their PM within 30 min. In control BOECs known cellular mechanisms for PM repair (endocytosis, lysosomal recruitment) were not critically involved in PM repair. Conclusions: PM repair is a major strategy of ECs to overcome complement-mediated injury. Our study indicates a new mechanism: Ca 2+ -dependent VWF recruitment to the EC surface resulting in complement regulation and EC PM repair via WPBs. The understanding of the detailed mechanism warrants further investigation. severely affected patients with D + HUS but the efficacy remains undetermined. In addition, increasing evidence shows heightened activity of the complement in this condition. Material and methods: Methods:We searched the databases Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and LiLACS for reports describing the outcome of Eculizumab administration in D + HUS. We also selected additional references through bibliographies from identified articles. We restricted the search to articles in English and French with no restrictions concerning time of publication. Results: We retrieved 9 reports representing 363 cases of D + HUS patients (children and adults) treated with Eculizumab. Reports ranged from case reports to retrospective cohort studies with the largest study population emanating from the 2011 German outbreak. Outcomes were variable but consistently showed dramatic improvements in severe cases with neurological involvement when eculizumab was administered early in the course. Conclusions: The efficacy of eculizumab in D + HUS cannot be established or disproven based on the limited available data but current data suggest that Eculizumab administration early in the course of severe cases might be efficacious especially in case of neurological involvement.",

Material and methods: We examined 236 children aged from 1 year to 17 years with UTI. Patients underwent DMSA scan and US examination, microbiological investigations of urine, renal function on the sample Rehberg translated at the Schwartz formula. Examined patients were divided in 2 groups: Ichildren who received Canephron N (n = 117); IIchildren who didn't receive Canephron N (n = 119). Definition of indicators was carried out in dynamics of 1 year from the start of antirelapse therapy of UTI with antimicrobial and fitodrag Canephron N. The dose was adjusted to patients individually depending on age, weight of the child. Results: The main performance indicators of antirelapse therapy of UTI with antimicrobial and fitodrag Canephron N was decrease on 27% (\u0440 < 0.05) frequency and duration of UTI in patients who received Canephron N (n = 117). Conclusions: Antirelapse therapy of UTI with antimicrobial and fitodrag Canephron N as a measure of prevention of progression of UTI is effective. Evaluating the effectiveness of antirelapse therapy of UTI with antimicrobial and fitodrag Canephron N justifies the use of these groups of drugs as prevention of progression of UTI in children.P-094 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES IN INFANTS WITH URETEROPELVIC JUNCTION OBSTRUCTIONAntigone Pavlaki, Nikoleta Printza, Evangelia Farmaki, Anna Taparkou, Styliani Stabouli, John Dotis, Chrysa Gkogka, Fotios Papachristou Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki, 1st Pediatric Department, Greece Introduction: The management of patients with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) remains a controversial issue. The objective is the preservation of renal function through early selection of patients who will require surgical intervention as opposed to the others who will be monitored systematically by various imaging methods. Aim of the present study was to measure Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) levels in UPJO patients who were planned to undergo surgery using standard criteria and thus clarify if MMPs levels could serve as potential biomarkers of obstruction in hydronephrosis. Material and methods: Serum samples of infants with UPJO diagnosis who were planned to undergo surgery were compared to 17 serum samples of healthy age matched controls. MMP2 and MMP9 were quantified using immunoenzymatic (ELISA) assay. Results: 17 infants with UPJO diagnosis, 14 males and three females, median age 1.5 months (min: one month, max: 20 months), mean anteroposterior diameter in the hydronephrotic kidney 23.4 mm (min: 19 mm, max: 50 mm) and T \u00bd > 20 min in the MAG3 renogramm were recruited. MMP9 levels were significantly decreased in serum samples of UPJO patients (418.53 ng/ml +/\u2212 256.78 ng/ml) vs control levels (572 ng/ml +/\u2212 226.96 ng/ml) (p = 0.037). MMP2 values were higher in UPJO patients (502.2 ng/ml +/\u2212 64.2 ng/ml) vs controls (471.42 ng/ml +/\u2212 123.35 ng/ml). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.206).Conclusions: This study presents decreased concentrations of MMP9 in the serum of patients with obstructive hydronephrosis but the results should be tested in larger population samples and even be evaluated simultaneously with urine samples in order to delineate MMPs ability to serve as obstruction biomarkers.P-095 GIANT HYDRONEPHROSIS DUE TO URETEROPELVIC JUNCTION OBSTRUCTION: A CASE REPORT Ay\u015ee Seda Pinarba\u015ei 1 , Zubeyde Gunduz 1 , Varol Nal\u00c7acio\u011elu 2 , Ruhan Dusunsel 1 , Den\u0130z Dem\u0130rc\u0130 2 , Hakan Poyrazoglu 1 , Nihal Sah\u0130n 1 , Ismail Dursun 1 1 Erciyes University Faculty Of Medicine, Department Of Pediatric Nephrology, Turkey; 2 Erciyes University Faculty Of Medicine, Department Of Pediatric Urology, Turkey",

ADPKD is genetically heterogeneous: the genes involved are PKD1 and PKD2.The aim of this study was to investigate patients with ADPKD. Material and methods: We evaluated every child with ADPKD diagnosed between October 2002 and January 2017. The diagnosis was based on familiy history and ultrasound confirmation of cysts. The investigated demographic and clinical characteristics were gender, age at diagnosis, mode of presentation, parental inheritance pattern, renal function, and the existence of hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria, and pyuria. Follow up of patients were also noted. median: 14) months. Nine patients(15%) were diagnosed in the first year of life. Family history of ADPKD was known at presentation in all patients. The most common presentations leading to diagnosis of ADPKD were positive family history for 24 patients(39%), abdomainal pain or mass for 15 patients(25%), other causes for 12 patients(20%) and antenatal detection of cysts with USG for 4 patients(7%). Bilateral renal findings were present in 43(70%), HT in 6 patients(10%). Ninety-eight percent of the patients had normal renal function. Only one patient was followed as chronic kidney disease. Thirteen patients(21%) had persistent proteinuria, 10(16%) had pyuria, and 2(3%) had microscopic hematuria. One patient had hepatic cysts, and none of them had splenic or pancreatic cysts.Conclusions:The results of the present study are better than most other series. The majority of children with ADPKD in this study were found to have a good prognosis.P-101 CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE KIDNEY AND URINARY TRACT (CAKUT) IN THE ETIOLOGICAL STRUCTURE CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS Elena Lysova, Nadezhda Savenkova, Irina Kutyrlo Saint-petersburg State Pediatric Medical University, Russian Federation Introduction: To study the frequency CAKUT in the etiological structure CKD by children and adolescents. Material and methods: This study includes 80 children with CKD, 34 children of them had \u0421AKUT in age 9.4 \u00b1 5.4 years. Out of 34 children -22 boys (64.4%) and 12 girls (35.6%). Results: It is established that in the etiological structure of CKD in 80 children and adolescents is dominated by congenital and hereditary kidney diseases in 75% cases. \u0421AKUT was diagnosed in 24 (70.5%) patients in perinatal and infantile period. From 34 children with \u0421AKUT: 18 patients (53%) had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (single or double direction) stage IV-V, 1 patient (3%) had bladder extrophy, 7 patients (20.5%) had hydronephrosis stage III-IV, 8 patients (23.5%) had reflux-nephropathy. Patients with VUR had posteror urethral valve, bladder dysfunction, ureterohydronephrosis. Reflux-nephropathy stage C, D is manifested by proteinuria, hypertension, renal scarring. Urinary tract infectionhad 26 (76.4%) patients. Children with \u0421AKUT had eGFR 28.6 \u00b1 22.3 ml/ min on 1.73 m 2 . Out of 34 children with CKD was diagnosted stage V in 11 (32.4%) patients, stage IV in 13 (38.2%) patients, stage III in 3 (14.7%) patients, stage II in 4 (11.5%) patients, stage I in 1 (2.9%) patients.

Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the DMSA findings and medical records of pediatric patients with hydronephrosis and/or atrophy who were at follow-up between January 2013 and December 2016 in our center which is located in the south-east region of Turkey. months, p = 0.002). Only 19.4% of the our patients with atrophy had VUR. The rate of VUR was higher in the high-grade group than the mild-to-moderate grade group, although the difference was not statistically significant (80% vs 61%, p = 0.199). Patients wiht high grade hydronephrosis had more severe DMSA findings (73% vs 39%). On the other side, 79% of the patients with high grade VUR had severe DMSA findings. A total of 10 patients had both atropy and hydronephrosis all affecting the left side. Six of them had VUR. Severe DMSA findings were more likely in toddlers (age 24-72 months) (48%).This finding was abruptly lowered after 72 months of age. Conclusions: Ultrasonographic findings of atrophy should also be evaluated for vascular renal pathologies in additon to VUR evaluation. In cases of left side renal pathologies of hydronephrosis and or atrophy the patients should closely monitored and furter evaluated even there is no urinary tract infection. Lastly, DMSA may not be necessary in cases with high grade hydronephrosis before MCU.

Material and methods: Case presentation of a adolescent girl with Recurrent urinary tract infections. On examination: dysraphismus with spinal nevus. No walking or other neurological deficits. Ultrasound: kidneys normal, bladder large and large amount of residuals, which can't be emptied after double voiding. Urine: pathologic usually, and urine pH is 7.0, even without UTI; Labs: normal values. Results: Uroflow: On presentation: intermittent curve, >800 ml urine, >200 ml residuals, voiding time > 40s, max flow 30 ml/s;. Lumbosacral MRI normal. Cystometry: increased compliance 655 ml, no involuntary contractions, stress test negative. Voiding phase: low bladder contractions, max flow 14 ml, intermittent curve, and with residuals 50 ml. Voiding Observation: first observations were not done properly, what made us to go further with examinations. And after the examinations we did observation again at the clinic and resulted: voiding around 4 L of urine and drinks large amount > 5 L. Voiding frequency was normal, no wetting incidents. By thirst and dessmopresin test, which resulted good kidney concentration ability, we excluded insipid diabetes. Conclusion was: Polyuria after polidypsia. We recommended limiting liquid intake and regular bladder emptying every 4-6 h, with double voiding and with regular bowel regime. And the results were good so far, no infections, urine pH <6, and no residuals after 1 year fellow up. Bladder wall was thinner, also. Conclusions: Increased residual urine on post-void ultrasound increases the risk of UTI recurrence in children with voiding dysfunction. This residual can be as a consequence of increased intake, also. Because of increased voiding frequency needs attempts to avoid voiding voluntary. This continuously increase bladder capacity. Thus, voiding and defecation history, physical examination, voiding frequency charts and defecation diaries are all essential parts of urodynamics and urologic examination.

Material and methods: We assessed the effect of GCS on the relationship between estimated GFR using the Schwartz equation (eGFR) and measured GFR using a single injection inulin clearance (Cin) in children both in a paired analysis and a cross-sectional study. Primary outcome parameter was the difference between eGFR and Cin (DGFR). Paired analysis was done in 22 patients during and without GCS treatment (median GFR 114 ml/min/1.73 m2, median prednisone dose 35.5 mg/m2/d).In a cross sectional analysis in 50 patients, 31 of which received GCS (median dose of 12 mg/m2/d) a dose-dependent effect was explored using univariate linear regression of various variables including GCS dosage, with DGFR as dependent variable. Results: The paired analysis showed no significant difference in DGFR with or without GCS (\u221223 [SD 53] vs. -9 [SD 41] ml/min/ 1.73 m2, p = 0.203). Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between age and DGFR, while GCS dose was not related to DGFR.

Reducing hyperammonaemia by using extra corporal elimination (EE), along side with natrium benzoate and symptomatic treatment was a standard management of severe metabolic decompensation, especially during the first manifestation of neonatal BCHOA. Nowadays there is a new therapeutic option in a form of carglumic acid, a drug registered for the treatment of hyperammonaemia in N-acetylglutamatsyntase deficiency (NAGS) and in the organic acidurias. Material and methods: We report the single-centre experiences with treatment of acute hyperammonaemia by carglumic acid in comparison to EE in cohort of 6 children with BCHOA. Two neonates with propionic acidaemia (PA) presented with acute hyperammonaemia above 500 \u03bcmol/L in the first week of life were treated with carglumic acid in addition to carnitine, protein-restricted diet and high energy load. Concentration of ammonia significantly reduced after one dose of carglumic acid 100 mg/kg in the first 24 h of treatment and maintained in normal range during the next week. Seven years old girl suffered by the neonatal form of PA, with repeated attacks of hyperammonaemia crises was admitted in severe metabolic acidosis, ketosis and hyperglycaemia. Carglumic acid 200 mg was given because of rapid raise of ammonia (over 4 h with 200 \u03bcmol/L) in addition to carnitin, insulin and bicarbonate.Results: The efficacy of ammonium removal was compared with group of 3 cases treated by peritoneal dialysis. Conclusions: Carglumic acid reduces hyperammonaemia as effectively as extra corporal detoxication and has fewer side effects. Our data strongly support current recommendations to use carglumic acid immediately after raising a suspicion of organic aciduria caused by metabolic disorders of branched amino acids even instead of EE.P-331 MAY DECREASED COMPLEMENT 4 BE A PREDICT\u0130VE FACTOR OF DECREASED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE IN CHILDREN W\u0130TH ACUTE POSTSTREPTOCOCCAL GLOMERULONEPHRITIS?Beltinge Demircioglu Kilic 1 , Mehtap Akbalik Kara 1 , Mithat Buyukcelik 1 , Ayse Balat 2 1 Gaziantep University, Turkey; 2 Istanbul Aydin University, Turkey Introduction: Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is the most common postinfectious glomerulonephritis in childhood. It was aimed to determine the possible risk factor(s), responsible for decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in APSGN. Material and methods: The data of patients followed up with the diagnosis of APSGN in the Pediatric Nephrology Clinic of Gaziantep University Hospital between October 2014 and October 2016 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Total number of subjects was 75 (E/K: 42/33) with the mean age of 8.20 \u00b1 3.25 years. Most common presentations were edema (86.7%), macroscopic hematuria (82.7%), proteinuria (77.3%), and hypertension (73.3%). In laboratory examination, 28 children (37.3%) had hypoalbuminemia, 20 (26.7%) with increased C reaktive protein (CRP), while 74 (98.7%) and 12 (16%) had decreased C3 and C4, respectively. The number of children with GFR value <90 ml/min/per 1.73/m 2 was 22 (29.3%). The risk of decreased GFR was found significantly higher in patients with increased CRP (p:0.001, OR:3.58), hypoalbuminemia (p:0.006, OR:4.83), and decreased C4 (p:0.010, OR:11.53). Additionally, leukocyte count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher (p:0.02, p:0.006, p:0.004, respectively) in patients with low GFR. significant difference in terms of cyst size. None of the cases of cayceal diverticulum require surgical intervention. Conclusions: It should be kept in mind that some of the patients with simple renal cysts may be calyceal diveritculum. MR urography can be used safely with advanced imaging techniques in differential diagnosis.P-335 BABY PORT: WHY NOT?Patrizia Di Matteo 1 , Ugo Graziano 2 , Lucia Calise 2 , Anna Corcione 2 , Salvatore Ferraiuolo 2 , Simona Fecarotta 3 , Giovanni Severino 2 , Maria Immacolata Spagnuolo 3 , Simona Spadarella 3 , Carmine Pecoraro 1 1 Unit Of Nephrology And Dialysis, Children Hospital \"santobonopausilipon\" -Naples, Italy; 2 Unit Of Surgery, Children Hospital \"santobono-pausilipon\" -Naples, Italy; 3 Department Of Pediatrics, University \"federico Ii\" -Naples, ItalyIntroduction: Port is a totally implantable system which allows a reliable long-term vascular access. It respects the body integrity and causes fewer local and/or systemic complications in respect of tunneled venous catheters. Port implantation procedure requires a special practice for obtaining insertion techniques skill, specific know-how to manage medical staff, and care-givers compliance. Despite of this advantages, the insertion of Baby Port devices is not yet not a widespread procedure.Baby Ports and VADs small-sized availability prompts the authors to investigate prcaticalutilization of these devices, verifying their performance in chronic patients requiring venous accesses for treatment. Material and methods: In a period of 18 monthseight male children aged between 4 months and 8 yearswere enrolled. The youngest one was affected by Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome finnish type (CNS) Six requiredi.v. discontinuous substitutive therapy; two required daily Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Results: Baby Ports implant was successfully performed in all. In the child with CNS, Baby Port, used for the daily albumin i.v. infusion, had a permanence lasting 13 months without serious adverse events.Primary complications were not observed. Secondary complications were more frequent during the period of care givers training and reduced after completing learning period.The complications rate was 1.5 sepsis/ 1000 catheters day,and 2.0 reversible clotting occlusion / 1000 catheters day; this rate was as high as the number of care givers/units involved. Conclusions: Baby Port is a real reliable device that can be used also for pt. who need daily therapies. Important to highlight its use is possible only with an appropriate training of care-givers.P-336 A RARE CAUSE OF CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE: CONORENAL SYNDROM Eren Soyalt\u0131n 1 , Belde Kasap Demir 2 , Caner Alparslan 1 , Se\u00e7il Arslansoyu \u00c7amlar 1 , Elif Perihan \u00d6ncel 1 , \u00d6zg\u00fcr K\u0131rb\u0131y\u0131k 3 , Demet Alaygut 1 , \u00d6nder Yava\u015fcan 1 , Fatma Mutluba\u015f 1 1 Izmir Tepecik Training And Research Hospital, Pediatric Nephrology Clinic, Turkey; 2 Izmir Katip Celebi University Pediatric Nephrology Clinic, Turkey; 3 Izmir Tepecik Training And Research Hospital, Medical Genetic Clinic, TurkeyIntroduction: Conorenal syndrome (Mainzer-Saldino Syndrome) was reported with cone-shaped epiphyseal plates, retinitis pigmentosa, ataxia and nephronophthisis leading to chronic renal damage in the later period. In this report, a case with the diagnosis of conorenal syndrome was reported. Material and methods: A 5 year old girl admitted to our hospital with diffuse edema on the eyelids and lower extremities, bilateral basiller crackles and mild ascites. She had growth retardation. Laboratory tests at admission revealed metabolic acidosis and azotemia. The GFR calculated using the Schwartz formula was 8.59 mL/min/1.73 m2. The ultrasound scan showed that both kidneys were small for her age and increase at bilateral renal echogenicty. She had accepted Stage 5 chronic kidney disease and got involved peritoneal dialysis program. Examinations carried for the etiology of renal failure; there wasn't vesicoureteral reflu or different urological pathologies. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral diffuse choroidal and retinal atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa. During the fallow up period, noticed on traces striking asymmetry in her fingers. When the upper and lower extremity radiographs obtained in, detected symmetrical shortening of the ulna in both forearms, shortening all the phalanx and dilatation of proximal metaphyseal joints. The biopsy required to show the nephronophthisis in the kidney, while directing it to Senior-Loken Syndrome, could not be done due to end-stage renal disease. In genetic screening, the previously reported p.G212R homozygote mutation associated with the disease was detected in the IFT 140 gene. Results: Following a 3-month peritoneal dialysis program, the patient underwent kidney transplantation from her mother. Conclusions: Detection of primary disease in patients with end-stage renal insufficiency can be difficult due to the reduced probability of biopsy. However, in the studies to be done for etiology, detection of retinitis pigmentosa findings and detection of cone shaped fingers should suggest conorenal syndrome.P-338 EFFICACY OF TREATMENT WITH ECULIZUMAB IN CHILDREN WITH AHUS Alexandra Mazo, Petr Ananin, Alexandr Pushkov, Kirill Savostianov, Olga Zrobok, Alexey Tsygin National Scientific And Practical Center Of Childrens Health",

They may be congenital (associated with genetic disorders or not) or acquired. Material and methods: The aim of the study was the retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized in two-years period (2015-2016) with suspicion/diagnosis of renal cysts. Results: In the analyzed time 1604 patients were hospitalized, among them 49 children (aged from 1 month to 17 years) met the inclusion criteria. In 30 cases, pateints were admitted to the clinic for the first time, in other cases -again. Among children hospitalized for the first time, there were 14 infants (mean age 4.2 months). Positive family history was noted in 2 children, renal cystic disease were suspected prenatally in 5 cases. Final diagnosis was: autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) in 3 children, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in 1, multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) in 4, connected with ectopia of left kidney in 1, bilateral MCDK in 1, isolated renal cyst in 2, renal hypodysplasia with cysts in 2 children. In 16 older children (mean age 10.1) diagnosed for the first time due to hypertension or abnormality in abdominal USG, ADPKD was diagnosed in 11 children, right MCDK in 4 and left MCDK in 1. In 19 patients hospitalized again (mean age 9.5) the diagnosis was: ADPKD in 4, ARPKD in 6, MCDK right in 4, MCDK left in 3, ADTKD in 1 and medullary sponge kidney in 1. In cases of 23 (47%) described children, chronic kidney disease (CKD) in different stages was diagnosed, in 3 patients kidney transplantation was performed. Acquired cysts were not found. Conclusions: Renal cysts are not a common cause of hospitalization (3.1% of our patients), but they require early diagnosis and monitoring of patients due to the risk of CKD development in some cases.P-341 THE COMPLICATIONS OF PERCUTANEOUS KIDNEY BIOPSY: ONE CENTER EXPERIENCE Tugba Yilmaz 2 , Fatma Dem\u0130r 2 , Ceren Coskun 2 , Ayse Seda Pinarbasi 1 , Hakan Poyrazoglu 1 , Zubeyde Gunduz 1 , Ruhan Dusunsel 1 , Ismail Dursun 1 1 Erciyes University Faculty Of Medicine, Department Of Pediatric Nephrology, Turkey; 2 Erciyes University Faculty Of Medicine, Turkey",

Atypical HUS (aHUS) is usually caused by disorders in complement alternative pathway regulation or may be secondary due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or other causes. aHUS represents 5-10% of HUS in children. The disease has a poor prognosis -50-60% progress to ESRD. Material and methods: We present a single centre experience of aHUS. Results: 7 patients (2 girls, 5 boys) were treated in The Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno klinikos during the period of 2007-2016. The mean age at the onset of the disease -6.0 (2.5-13) years. Anti-CFH was diagnosed for two patients. Four patients had negative genetic test results. Genetic tests were not performed for 2 patients. Plasma therapy as initial treatment was prescribed for 5 patient, one received Eculizumab and 1 patient was treated for sepsis. Supportive treatment was prescribed for 3 patients: 2 received Eculizumab, one -Mycophenolate Mofetil with Ig-Immunoglobulin G. Four (57%) children developed Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). One of them was transplanted. Children treated with Eculizubam had good outcomes: one has normal renal function, the other improved renal function (chronic dialysis was stopped and the child has CKD st. 3).Conclusions: 7 children diagnosed aHUS during the period of 10 years. 1. Four (57%) children developed CKD. One of them was transplanted. 2. Causes of aHUS are different thats why clinical features and outcomes are different. 3. Treatment with Eculizumab significantly improved outcome of the disease. P-345 A SIMPLIFIED APPROACH TO THE CHILD WITH HEMATURIA Meesters Kevin 2 , Vande Walle Johan 1 1 Department Of Pediatric Nephrology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belg\u0131um; 2 Department Of Pediatrics, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belg\u0131umIntroduction: Hematuria is a frequent reason for consultation of pediatric nephrologists. However, hematuria in children is usually a less frequent complaint for consulting community medical settings. Furthermore, many cases of hematuria are tansient and do not recur. This frequently results in diagnostic dilemmas, as unnecessary investigations and treatment should be avoided. However, children suffering any serious renal or urologic disease, should urgently be referred to a pediatric subspecialist. In this abstract, we present our simplified approach to the child with hematuria. Material and methods: By means of a literature review and a review of charts of patients who were referred to pediatric nephrology clinic, we developed a structured and simplified approach to the child with hematuria. Results: A thorough history and complete physical examination should be the first step in all children evaluated for hematuria. However, children with any indication of traumatic hematuria, or signs of severy systemic illnesses such as sepsis, should urgently be treated according to applicable protocols such as APLS guidelines. In selected cases, different urinalyses are usually a rational next step in the diagnostic process. Other tests, such as radiology and lab tests, should be performed with clear indications. An adequate follow-up is mandatory for all children presenting with hematuria. Conclusions: The diagnostic work-up of hematuria can be simplified using a structured approach.P-346 PARTICULAR QUALITIES OF RENAL FILTRATION FUNCTION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH OBESITY Irina Balalaeva, Tatyana Stepanova Voronezh N.n.

This multi-informant assessment explores QoL (PedsQL\u2122 4.0 Generic Core), psychological problems [Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) / Teacher Report Form (TRF) / Youth Self Report (YSR)], attention [Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale (DBDRS)), and executive functioning (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)]. Results: Parents and patients both significantly (p < 0.001) reported a lower QoL (69 \u00b1 19 and 71 \u00b1 14, respectively) compared to control parents and healthy children(88 \u00b1 11 and 83 \u00b1 11, respectively). Regarding the CBCL/TRF/YSR, 15/36 parents scored their child in the (sub)clinical range of internalizing problems compared to only 6/20 children and 7/26 teachers. Externalizing problems in the children seems to be less present: 7/36 parents, 1/20 child and 6/26 teachers generated scores in the (sub)clinical range. (Sub)clinical scores for attentional functioning of children were found in 2/19 parents and 1/18 teachers. The executive functioning of children was considered as (sub)clinical by 3/26 parents and 3/20 teachers.Conclusions: The quality of life in children with CKD is impaired. Almost half of the parents are concerned regarding possible internalizing problems of their child. A multidisciplinary family-based therapy is therefore recommended.P-352 PARENTAL EXPERIENCE OF PAEDIATRIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATIONStacie Bowden, Cathy Gill, Amanda Richardson, Grainne Walsh, Joanna Clothier, Joanna Clothier Evelina London Childrens Hospital, UK Introduction: Kidney transplantation is life changing not only for the individual receiving the transplant but for the whole family/support network.",

Vitamin B6 levels are not routinely tested in paediatric dialysis patients and recent data is lacking in this patient group. K/DOQI guidelines recommend that children with CKD on dialysis receive a water-soluble vitamin supplement. This study investigated vitamin B6 concentrations in our paediatric dialysis patients. Material and methods: Retrospective review, including all children on maintenance dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, PD; home haemodialysis, HHD; intermittent haemodialysis, IHD), for vitamin B6 concentrations over a recent 24 month period. Results: 18 children (8 HD, 7 PD, 3 HHD) with mean \u00b1 SD age 8.4 \u00b1 6.3 years (15 boys). There were 14 white British, 3 Black and 1 Asian ethnicity. Vitamin B6 concentrations were within range (35.2-110.1 nmol/L) in 44% with the remainder above normal range (130-404.1 nmol/L). Eleven children were receiving enteral feeds, 8 had high vitamin B6 levels of which 6 were feed dependent (feeds provided 0.08-1.04 mg vitamin B6/d) (40-148% DRV). Half of these children were meeting their DRV for vitamin B6 from feeds alone. Four of the feed dependent children received a supplement containing vitamin B6 (1-11 mg vitamin B6/d) (1-12 times the DRV). Seven children were not tube fed, 2 had high vitamin B6 levels, 1 was receiving a supplement containing vitamin B6 (0.25 mg daily; 21% DRV). Conclusions: Children in our dialysis group, who were not receiving a tube feed had normal/high vitamin B6. The need for supplementation in children who are tube feed dependent needs to be reviewed as this is contributing to high vitamin B6 levels. Half of these children were already meeting their DRV for vitamin B6 from feed alone. Routine vitamin B6 supplementation is currently not indicated in our paediatric dialysis patients.P-355 AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN URINARY METABOLIC DISTURBANCES AND INFANT FEEDING IN CHILDREN WITH MALABSORPTION SYNDROMEElena Tush, Tatiana Lazareva, Olga Khaletskaya Nizhgma, Russ\u0131aIntroduction: Big affinity of functioning of plasmatic membranes of a kidney and bowel at transport of various elements, including oxalates and uric acid is noted. So, the aim of our study is investigate urinary metabolic disturbances at children with a malabsorption syndrome depending on character of food on the first year of life. Material and methods: 92 children with syndrome of malabsorption who are earlier not examined and not the treated concerning changes from an urinary system aged from 2 months up to 6 years have been examined. From them -42 (45.6%) patients with a celiac disease, 50 (54.4%) -with chronic enteritis. 51 (65.2%) of the patient had clinical manifestation of the main disease, 41 (34.8%) had a phase of incomplete clinical laboratory remission. The daily excretion of oxalates, uric acid, creatinine was investigated, character of food on 1 year of life was analyzed. Results: Direct correlation between metabolic disturbances in relatives and hyperoxaluria in the child is revealed (r = 0.42; \u0440 = 0.01). It is received that children early separated from a breast had incresed risk of hyperoxaluriya by 1.4 times (\u0440 =0.003). Children who separated from a breast up to 6 months had excretion of oxalates of urine 2.90 \u00b1 0.24 and after 6 months -2.33 \u00b1 0.21 mg/kg/days. Children who received meat up to 6 months had a statistically significantly higher daily excretion of uric acid (2.91 \u00b1 0.49 and 1.78 \u00b1 0.16 respectively, t = 2.605; p = 0.01), and uric acid/creatinine and calcium/creatinine index too. Conclusions: Character of food on 1 year of life has significant effect on a functional condition of kidneys. The early end of the breastfeeding and start of a meat feeding up has adverse effect.P-356 OBTAINING GROWTH DATA USING HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEMSCaroline Anderson 1 , Colin Newell 1 , Rodney Gilbert 1 , Stephen Wootton 2 1 University Hospital Southampton, UK; 2 University Of Southampton, UK",

We are currently sending questionnaires, devised by the authors to all children and their families who have undergone a kidney transplant in the last 5 year (approx. n = 60). We are looking at their experiences pre, during and post transplant in relation to the psychological support they received and require. Drawing on themes from the questionnaires we then plan to interview 3-4 families about their experiences. Material and methods: Questionnaire devised by authors and interviews with 3-4 families using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: Not known yet. Conclusions: We hope that the findings will enable us to revise the support Clinical Psychology offer to children and families undergoing kidney transplants at the RHC in Glasgow.P-360 ANALYSIS OF CILIATED PODOCYTES DURING NORMAL HUMAN GLOMERULAR DEVELOPMENT AND IN NEPHROTIC KIDNEYS Katarina Vukojevic 1 , Mirna Saraga-babic 2 , Natalija Filipovic 2 , Ivana Bocina 3 , Merica Glavina Durdov 4 , Marijan Saraga 5 1 Department Of Histology And Embryology, School Of Medicine, University Of Mostar, Mostar, Bosn\u0131a And Herzegov\u0131na; 2 Department Of Anatomy, Histology And Embryology, School Of Medicine, University Of Split, Croat\u0131a; 3 Department Of Biology, University Of Split, Split, Croat\u0131a; 4 Department Of Pathology, University Hospital In Split, Split, Croat\u0131a; 5 Department Of Paediatrics, University Hospital In Split, Split, Croat\u0131aIntroduction: Primary cilia are non-motile sensory organelles involved in the control of different cellular processes, including cell differentiation. The role of primary cilia has been implicated in numerous cystic kidney diseases. By now, primary cilia have been detected on the surfaces of tubular cells and collecting ducts in developing and postnatal human kidneys. In the present study we analyze appearance and percentage of primary cilia on the surfaces of developing human healthy and nephrotic podocytes. Material and methods: Kidney tissue were dissected from human conceptuses 8th-38th postovulatory week old, postnatal healthy and nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF) kidneys. They were stained by double immunofluorescent technique, using \u03b1tubulin as primary cilia marker and DAPI as nuclear marker. Cilia were counted on cell surfaces and their percentage was calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunns post-hoc test. Ultrastructural characteristics of podocytes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Results: Between the 8th and 10th developmental week, population of metanephric cup cells contained 24% of ciliated cells, immature glomeruli 47% and Bownam's capsule cells (parietal podocytes) 26%. Percentage of ciliated podocytes decreased to 10% in the 38th week and then to 3% in postnatal period. Number of ciliated cells in Bowman's capsule first increased to 32% by the 22nd developmental week, and postnatally decreased to 16%. Compared to healthy kidneys, CNF podocytes showed increased number of ciliated podocytes (12%) and Bowman's capsule cells (19%). Conclusions: Prospective human podocytes contain primary cilia already at the metanephric cup stage. During development, number of ciliated podocytes decreases in accordance with podocyte differentiation, while Bowman's capsule cells retain higher percentage of ciliated cell, thus indicating their potential in podocyte regeneration. Compared to healthy kidneys, both cell populations of CNF kidneys display higher percentage of primary cilia, pointing to their incomplete maturation.P-361 EXPRESSION OF CONNEXINS CX 43 AND CX45 IN DEVELOPING HUMAN KIDNEYS, POSTNATAL HEALTHY KIDNEYS AND IN CONGENITAL NEPHROTIC SYNDROME OF THE FINNISH TYPE (CNF) Department Of Anatomy, Histology And Embryology, School Of Medicine, University Of Split, Split Croat\u0131a; 2 Department Of Histology And Embryology, School Of Medicine, University Of Mostar, Bosn\u0131a And Herzegov\u0131na; 3 Department Of Biology, University Of Split, Split, Croat\u0131a; 4 Department Of Paediatrics, University Hospital In Split, Split, Croat\u0131aIntroduction: Connexins are transmembrane proteins that either form gap junctions, enabling cell-to cell communications, or form unpaired channels that allow communication between the cell and extracellular environment. In animals, Cx43 and Cx45 are found in renal vasculature, while Cx45 in vascular muscle wall and in glomeruli, including mesangial cells and podocytes. Cx43 expression decreases during epithelialto mesenchymal transition, while increases in chronic renal diseases. Here, we investigate changes in expression and distribution of Cx43 and Cx45 during human nephrogenesis, in healthy and nephrotic kidneys. Material and methods: Human kidney tissue was dissected from conceptuses 8th to 38th postovulatory weeks old, from postnatal healthy kidneys as well as from the CNF kidneys. Double immunofluorescence technique was used to detect expression and localization of Cx43 and Cx45, combined with DAPI nuclear stain. Their distribution and intensity of expression was presented semiquantitatively. Results: In the metanephric cup stage moderate expression of Cx45 characterized all cup cells; weak Cx43 expression characterized mesenchymal cells corresponding to developing vasculature. During progression of development, Cx45 expression increased in all glomerular cells (visceral and parietal podocytes and mesangial cells), while Cx43 expression was restricted to vascular (endothelial) cells and parietal podocytes. Postnatally, Cx45 was observed throughout glomeruli; Cx43 was observed in vascular cells and parietal podocytes. Stronger and changed expression of Cx45 and Cx43 characterizes CNF glomeruli. Coexpression of Cx43/Cx45 was observed in some glomerular cells and parietal podocytes. Conclusions: During human kidney development Cx43 predominantly appears in the endothelium of blood vessels indicating its role in vasculogenesis. Cx45 is expressed during the whole nephrogenesis, pointing to importance of cell-to-cell communication in differentiation of podocytes and mesangial cells. Changed expression of Cx45/Cx43 in CNF kidneys imply interference of defective cells signaling with chronic kidney disease.P-362 THE STAGES OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES AT T H E D E V E L O P M E N T O F N E P H R O S C L E R O S I S I N CHILDREN WITH OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHYAlexandra Krutova 1 , Valentina Luchaninova 2 , Elena Melnikova 1 , Olga Semeshina 1 , Oxana Perelomova 3 1 \"childrens Regional Clinical Hospital \u21161\", Vladivostok, Russ\u0131a; 2 North-west State Medical University By I.i.

Renal transplantation is recognised to produce significant survival benefits in patients with ESRF. Hypertension in the ESRF population is a known risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and is associated with poorer graft function. Material and methods: A retrospective review was undertaken of all paediatric patients receiving a renal transplant in Scotland from January 2001 to July 2014. During this period 119 patients were identified, aged 2.4 years to 20.3 years at time of transplantation. Data gathered included demographics, diagnoses, blood results, blood pressure and BMI (body mass index) over time. Results: 23 patients had pre-emptive transplants, 34 were on haemodialysis and 62 peritoneal dialysis prior to transplantation. On long term follow up 4 patients were deceased, 2 had moved out of area, 108 were in transplant clinic follow up and 5 were on haemodialysis. Our results demonstrate that posttransplant 15-39% of our patients had systolic blood pressures (SBP) of over 95th Centile during the 5 year follow up period, with a peak at 30 days post transplantation. During this period there were 17.6% to 31.0% of patients recorded to be receiving antihypertensive medication. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the different time points was recorded and whether antihypertensives were prescribed at these time points. Results showed that patients receiving antihypertensives tended to have higher eGFR, however this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates a peak of SPB 30 days post transplant which is in keeping with previous data. However overall our study population demonstrated a much lower level of hypertension than previous studies, which suggest 60-90% of patients are hypertensive after renal transplant. Interestingly we found that patients on antihypertensive treatment tended to have longer time with eGFR greater than 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m2, than those not receiving antihypertensives. This result was unexpected as we would expect those with hypertension to have poorer renal function. This positive association with antihypertensives and increased GFR may be a surrogate marker for compliance. An alternative explanation may be that we need to be more aggressive with hypertension management post transplantation aiming for a lower SBP.P-365 PREDICTORS OF POST-TRANSPLANT GROWTH IN PREPUBERTAL CHILDREN WITH END-STAGE CKDDoris Franke 1 , Reiner Rebling 1 , Kerstin Froede 1 , Leo Pavicic 2 , Jutta Gellermann 3 , Dominik M\u00dcller 3 , Uwe Querfeld 1 , Dieter Haffner 1 , Miroslav Zivicnjak 1 1 Department Of Pediatric Kidney, Liver And Metabolic Diseases, Hannover Medical School, Germany; 2 Rendiceva 28b, Czech Republ\u0131c; 3 Department Of Pediatric Nephrology, Charit\u00e9 University Hospital, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13,353 Berlin, GermanyIntroduction: Disproportionate short stature is a frequent complication of CKD. Here we evaluated post-transplant growth during childhood in renal allograft recipients who were enrolled in the CKD Growth and Development observational cohort study. Material and methods: Linear growth (height, leg length, and sitting height) was prospectively investigated in a cohort 207 renal transplant recipients aged 2-12 years with a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. Predictors of growth outcome after transplantation were evaluated by the use of linear mixed-effect models. Results: Pre-transplant mean SD scores (SDS) for all linear body dimensions were reduced (height, \u22122.32 SDS; sitting height, \u22121.49 SDS; leg length, \u22122.43 SDS), and sitting height index was increased (1.33 SDS) compared to healthy children (each p < 0.001), indicating disproportionate short stature. After transplantation mean standardized height continuously increased until the age of 12 years (\u22121.38 SDS, p < 0.01 vs. pretransplant). Leg length was the anthropometric parameter with the greatest plasticity after transplantation. The preferential stimulation of leg growth resulted in normalization of sitting height index by puberty in most patients. Beside living-related transplantation, use of growth hormone in the pre-transplant period, steroid exposure, and hemoglobin levels were identified as potentially modifiable significant predictors of post-transplant growth. Growth hormone treatment before transplantation showed the highest impact on stature and sitting height, whereas transplantation at a young age (< 5 years) showed the strongest association with leg growth and consequently the degree of body disproportion. Conclusions: Renal transplantation during childhood results in normalization of height in the vast majority of patients. Use of growth hormone in the pre-transplant period, living-related transplantation, transplantation at a young age, reduction of steroid exposure, and better control of anemia are promising measures further improving growth outcome.Material and methods: Biopsies perfomed annually for 5 years in kidney transplant recipient children between October 2007-April 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. Gender, transplantation age, donor types, mismatches, treatment modalities, follow-up durations were recorded. Indication biopsies(IB), inappropriate samples(IS,<7 glomerulus) and unaccesible materials(UM) were excluded. All biopsies were scored (0-3) for peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis, C4d staining, interstitial inflammation, tubulitis, intimal arteritis, vascular intimal fibrosis and arterial hyalinosis. Sum of the scores were notes as \"Banff score(BS)\". Complications, interventions, concurrent serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rates(GFR) and proteinuria levels were recorded and their relation with BS was evaluated. Results: A total of 205 biopsies were performed in 42 patients (M/F: 22/20) between above-mentioned dates. When IBs(n:45), ISs(N:26) and UMs(n: 16) were excluded, there were 118 PBs (29 implantation, 89 follow-up). Forty of the patients received basiliximab for induction and 38 received steroid + tacrolimus + mycophenolate for initial maintenance therapy. The number of follow-up biopsies at 5th-year,4th-year,3rd-year,2nd-year and 1st-year were 7,16,16,20 and 30, respectively. Abnormalities were found in 10(%8.5) of the PBs (bordeline: 6, subclinical rejection: 4) and an intervention was made in 4 of them. Negative correlations between GFR and BS were significant in 4th %0.8) were acceptable. There is no patient lost, 1 graft lost due to nonadherence and 2 patients with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL due to chronic allograft nephropathy all through the follow-up duration.Conclusions:The treatment protocol and follow-up with annual protocol biopsies seems efficient and safe in children. Better results may be attained when all our patients complete the five-year period.P -3 6 7 O U R E X P E R I E N C E I N E N -B L O C K I D N E Y TRANSPLANTATION INCLUDING PARTIAL BLADDER PATCH TECHNIC PATIENTS, INTO CHILDREN RECIPIENTS Caner Alparslan 1 , Eren Soyaltin 1 , Fatma Mutluba\u015e 1 , Se\u00c7il Arslansoyu \u00c7amlar 1 , Elif Perihan \u00d6ncel 2 , Demet Alaygut 1 , Belde Kasap Demir 3 , \u00d6nder Yava\u015ecan 1 , Cem Tu\u011emen 4 , Ey\u00dcp Kebab\u00c7i 4 , Cezmi Karaca 4 1 Izmir Tepecik Training And Research Hospital, Pediatric Nephrology, Turkey; 2 Izmir Tepecik Training And Research Hospital, Pediatrics, Turkey; 3 Izmir Katip Celebi University, Pediatric Nephrology, Turkey; 4 Izmir Tepecik Training And Research Hospital, Organ Transplantation Unit, Turkey",

However, the impact of recipient's age on transplant outcomes remains unclear. We investigated short-term outcome of estimated glomerular filtration rate (e GFR) in children after kidney transplantation based on their age at transplant. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of pediatric living donor kidney transplant recipients who were transplanted adult kidney in our department from March 2009 to October 2014. Forty two recipients were followed over two years. These recipients were divided into 3 groups based on the age at transplant: Low (2-5 years, N = 22), median (6-10 years, N = 19), and high(11)(12)(13)(14)(15) years, N = 18) age group. We compared the median eGFR of each age group at 1 month (P1), 4 months (P2), 12 months (P3), and 24 months (P4) after transplantation. The mean age and eGFR of donors at transplant were 41.5 \u00b1 7.9 years and 79.7 \u00b1 15.2 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Results: eGFR was calculated using a creatinine-based equation for Japanese children and adolescents aged 2-18 years. The changes of eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) in each age group were shown as follows: The changes of eGFR between points were examined by paired t-test.Low: P1-P2 (P<0.01), P2-P3 (P<0.01), P3-P4 (P = 0.51). Median: P1-P2 (P<0.01), P2-P3 (P<0.01), P3-P4 (P = 0.38). High: P1-P2(P<0.01), P2-P3(P = 0.125), P3-P4(P = 0.97). Conclusions: In the first two years after pediatric kidney transplantation, eGFR of the recipients deteriorated over time regardless of age. Furthermore, the slope of eGFR decline tended to be larger in younger age group and earlier period of post-transplant. P-369 MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT CMV VIREMIA SECONDARY TO A RARE VIRAL MUTATION IN PAEDIATRIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH ANTI-PROLIFERATIVE CESSATION AND IMMUNOGLOBULINS Rachel Folwell 1 , Grainne Walsh 1 , Helen E Jones 1 , Eithne Macmahon 2 , Jelena Stojanovic 1 1 Evelina London Childrens Hospital, London, UK; 2 Guys And St Thomas Nhs Foundation Trust, London, UKIntroduction: International Transplant Society for CMV Consensus Group advises ganciclovir, valganciclovir and foscarnet as treatment for CMV in transplant recipients. Viral DNA polymerase resistance mutations are rare but may be associated with cross resistance. We report a rare CMV mutation associated with resistance to all available medications in a CMV seronegative recipient treated with immunosuppression dose reduction and IVIG.Material and methods: Retrospective data analysis from medical records. Results: Sixteen year old girl with ESRD due to Alport Syndrome received deceased donor kidney transplant (mismatch 120, CMV Donor+/Recipient-, EBV Donor\u2212/Recipient+). She received basilixumab on induction and her maintanance immunosuppression included tacrolimus, azathioprine and prednisolone. As per our centre protocol, she was started on valganciclovir prophylaxis for 90 days. Two months post-transplant, whilst on valganciclovir prophylaxis, she developed CMV viremia. Viral loads continued to rise (highest log 5.41) despite the treatment dose intravenous ganciclovir. She was found to have a rare CMV UL 54 mutation (POL gene deletion 981/982), associated with multidrug resistance. She had no evidence of CMV disease and stable graft function, and was managed with cessation of azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). CMV IgM was positive at 4 months, with IgG seroconversion demonstrated at 9 months post transplant with CMV PCR not detected from month 9 onwards. She developed borderline T cell mediated rejection successfully treated with high dose of oral prednisolone. Eighteen months post transplant, patient is well with stable graft function (estimated GFR 69 ml/min/1.73 m2) on CNI inhibitor and daily prednisolone only. Donor specific antibodies are not detected. To date, cytotoxic T cell response to CMV is negative but CMV remains undetectable. Conclusions: We report a case of multidrug resistant CMV viremia in a transplant recipient with primary CMV infection, managed with IVIG and cessation of anti-proliferative agent only with excellent patient outcome including preservation of good graft function.P-370 MEDICATION NON-ADHERENCE IS A LEADING MODIFIABLE CAUSE FOR RENAL GRAFT LOSS IN CHILDHOOD -A LARGE CENTRE STUDYNabil Melhem, Nadeesha Mudalige, Stacie Bowden, Grainne Walsh, Helen Jones, Nicos Kessaris, Nizam Mamode, Jelena Stojanovic Introduction: Despite continued advances in transplantation, it has been observed that the rate of renal graft failure is disproportionately high amongst the adolescent population. This study looked into why grafts fail in children. Material and methods: Retrospective observational study in a single paediatric transplant centre between 2003 and 2016. All patients transplanted during study period and those transplanted previously and followed up during the study period were included. Results: During the study period, 171 paediatric kidney transplants were performed. Median follow up was 8 years (IQR 10 years).",

            "text": "P-371 RITUXIMAB AND PLASMA EXCHANGE DOES NOT PREVENT DISEASE RECURRENCE IN HIGH RISK FSGS FOLLOWING LIVING DONOR TRANSPLANTATIONMohan Shenoy, Amrit Kaur, Rachel Lennon, Nicholas Webb, Nicholas Plant Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, UK Introduction: For patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), disease recurrence (DR) following renal transplantation (RT) is a significant concern. Patients with rapidly progressive primary disease, negative genetic screening and those with previous graft loss secondary to DR are most at risk. There is no consensus regarding the prevention and management of DR. Material and methods: Four children with high risk FSGS, including 2 with previous graft loss due to DR, underwent living donor RT. All were managed with a uniform protocol of a single dose of rituximab (375 mg/ m2) 4 weeks prior to RT and 4 sessions of plasma exchange (PE) over the week prior to RT. DR was defined as urine protein:creatinine ratio > 200 mg/mmol on 2 consecutive days. Results: One child with previous graft loss (Pt 1) had immediate DR and received PE for 5 months post-transplant. Another had immediate DR as well as impaired graft function and following a partial response to PE, developed graft failure at 6 months. The third, who had previous graft loss (Pt 3) had DR at day 4 which responded to 5 sessions of PE. The fourth child had a comparatively late DR at 1 month and has continued on weekly PE 7 months.Immunosuppression Ba/T/MMF Ba/T/MMF Ba/T/MMF/P Ba/T/ Conclusions: In this small cohort of patients with high risk FSGS, rituximab and PE pre-RT, did not reduce the risk of DR. However, in children with DR, including 2 patients with previous graft loss, the disease responded well to PE. We are encouraged by our data to continue advocating the use of living donors for this difficult group of patients.P-372 PRESERVATION OF RENAL FUNCTION WITH EVEROLIMUS PLUS REDUCED-DOSE TACROLIMUS AND CORTICOSTEROID WITHDRAWAL-BASED REGIMEN IN DE NOVO PEDIATRIC RENAL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS: 12-MONTH RESULTS FROM THE CRADLE STUDYIntroduction: CRADLE (NCT01544491) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of everolimus with reduced-dose tacrolimus (EVR + rTAC) and early corticosteroid (CS) withdrawal regimen in pediatric renal transplant recipients (pRTxR). Here, we report the 12-month (M) renal function outcomes from the study. Material and methods: In this 12 M core + 24 M follow-up, phase III, multicenter, open-label study, pRTxR (\u22651-< 18 years) on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + standard-dose TAC (sTAC) + CS were randomized (1:1) at 4-6 weeks post-Tx to EVR + rTAC with CS withdrawal at 6 M (EVR C 0 :3-8 ng/mL; TAC C 0 :randomization [RND]-M3, 4-6 ng/mL; from M4, 2-4 ng/mL); or sTAC + MMF + CS (TAC C 0 :RND-M3, 7-10 ng/mL; from M4, 5-8 ng/mL). Co-primary objectives were to evaluate renal function (eGFR; updated Schwartz) and composite efficacy failure (biopsy-proven acute rejection [BPAR], graft loss, or death) at M12. Other objectives included overall safety. Results: Of 106 (EVR + rTAC, N = 52 and MMF + sTAC, N = 54) patients randomized, 65.4% in EVR + rTAC arm and 87.0% in MMF + sTAC arm completed study treatment. M12 adherence to TAC target C 0 was 50% in EVR + rTAC and 51.1% in MMF + sTAC arms; 38.9% patients in EVR + rTAC arm were above TAC target C 0 and 26.7% in MMF + sTAC arm were below target C 0 at M12. Mean eGFR was comparable between arms (Table 1). From RND to M12, mean eGFR numerically increased in EVR + rTAC arm, whereas it decreased in MMF + sTAC arm. Rates of BPAR were comparable between arms (Table 2) with 100% renal graft and patient survival. Overall safety including renal adverse events (AE; EVR + rTAC, 15.4% vs MMF + sTAC, 18.5%) were similar between arms. AE leading to study drug discontinuation were higher in EVR + rTAC vs MMF + sTAC arm. Most patients (EVR + rTAC, 72.5% vs MMF + sTAC, 78.3%) had mildly increased urinary protein:creatinine ratio at M12. One patient in EVR + rTAC arm discontinued study treatment due to proteinuria. Conclusions: Despite poor adherence to TAC C 0 , EVR + rTAC and CS withdrawal regimen preserved renal function while maintaining efficacy and safety in pRTxR up to 12 M post-Tx.",

Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a real time, non-invasive technique for monitoring oxygenation percutaneously. Validation of NIRS in real time monitoring of renal allograft perfusion by direct comparison to doppler ultrasound has not been reported. The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether tissue oxygenation indices from NIRS can reliably assess blood flow in established renal transplants. Material and methods: Paediatric renal transplant recipients (pRTRs) aged 1-18 years with stable allograft function were eligible. Participants underwent routine outpatient renal transplant ultrasound assessment of perfusion as per protocol including resistive index (RI) calculations at upper, and lower poles. NIRS data (Tissue Oxygenation Index-TOI) were recorded for 2 min with two NIRS sensors placed on the skin over the transplant poles as previously marked from ultrasound. Results: Thirteen pRTRs with median age 16 years (range 5.3 to 17.8) and median allograft age 44.7 months (range 6.4 to 148.7) were recruited. Fifty-4 % were male and 69% living donor pRTRs. NIRS monitoring was well tolerated by all participants with a 96-100% rate of valid measurements. Significant negative correlations were observed between TOI recorded with NIRS, and RI from doppler ultrasound for both upper and lower poles (r = \u22120.7 for both, p = 0.01 and 0.02 respectively). TOI measured with NIRS was a significant predictor of doppler ultrasound RI in adjusted linear regression models for upper and lower pole (p = 0.01 and 0.02 respectively).Conclusions: NIRS indices correlate well with doppler ultrasound graft perfusion parameters in established pRTRs. Further studies are warranted to extend NIRS use for continuous real-time monitoring of early posttransplant vascular complications.

We hypothesised that patients with complement activating DSA would have poorer renal allograft outcomes. Material and methods: 75 children developed DSA in the original study. The first positive DSA sample was subsequently tested for C1q and C3d fixing. Primary event was defined as 50% reduction from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Serial DSA positive samples were subsequently tested for C3d fixing and MFI results were correlated with eGFR using multi-level models.Results: Of 65 patients tested, 32 (49%) and 23 (35%) were positive for C1q and C3d fixing respectively. 13/32 (41%) C1q positive patients did not show concomitant C3d fixing. MFI values of original IgG DSA correlated poorly with complement fixing positivity [C1q: adjusted R 2 = 0.072; C3d: adjusted R 2 = 0.11, p < 0.05]. C1q + antibodies were associated with acute tubulitis [C1q + 0.75(\u00b1 0.18) v C1q-0.25(\u00b1 0.08) episodes per patient, p < 0.05] but not worse long-term renal allograft dysfunction [median time to primary event C1q + 5.9 v C1q-6.4 years, p = 0.58]. C3d + antibodies were associated with positive C4d histological staining [C3d + 47% v C3d-20%, p = 0.04] and significantly worse long-term allograft dysfunction [median time to primary event C3d + 5.6 v C3d-6.5 years, p = 0.04]. Changes in C3d MFI did not correlate with eGFR over time.Conclusions: Assessment of C3d fixing as part of prospective HLA monitoring can potentially aid stratification of patients at highest risk of long-term renal allograft dysfunction.P-377 BILATERAL NEPHRECTOMIES FOLLOWED BY LIVING RELATED DONOR RENAL TRANSPLANTATION IN A 2 YEAR OLD CHILD WITH INTRA-RENAL ANEURYSMAL FIBROMUSCULAR DYSPLASIA Ji Soo Kim (below 35) 1 , Kjell Tullus 1 , Andrew Lunn 2 , Neil J Sebire 1 , Pankaj Chandak 1 , Imran Mushtaq 1 , Colin Forman 3 , Nicos Kessaris 1 , Nizam Mamode 1 , Stephen Marks 1 1 Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK; 2 Nottingham University Hospitals Nhs Trust, UK; 3 Royal Free London Nhs Foundation Trust, UK",

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, clinical features and risk factors of BKV infection in pediatric renal transplant patients in our center. Material and methods: We retrospectively scanned the data files of 122 patients who had renal transplant. BKV values were recorded measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction test in urine and serum. Patients with and without Polyoma BK infection were compared to assess risk factors in terms of chronic renal failure etiology, donor types, immunosuppressive treatments, ureteral stent, acute rejection episodes and accompanying viral infection. Results: BKV infection were detected in 10 patients (8.19%). Ten patients (100%) developed BKV viruri; 7 (70%) BKV viremia; 4 (40%) BKV nephropathy. Acute humoral rejection was present in 3 of BKV nephropathy. Graft loss developed in 2 (1.6%) patients with BKV nephropathy. Patients with BKV infection gender, age of transplantation, donor type, etiology of renal failure, immunosuppressive treatment, ureteral stent, acute rejection were similar to patients without BKV infection. There was no significant difference between first year GFR of patients with BKV infection and those without BKV infection. Accompanying CMV infection were significantly higher in patients with BKV infection (p = 0.013). BK virus nephropathy had more acute rejection, ureteral stent, CMV association and higher rate of graft loss than BK viruri or viremia (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The risk of developing graft loss is high in patients with BKV nephropathy. Close monitoring, early detection have a significant effect on the prognosis of polyomavirus BK infection.P-379 CONVERTING IMMUNOSUPPRESSION FROM PROGRAF\u00ae TO MODIGRAF\u00ae IN PAEDIATRIC RENAL TRANSPLANT PATIENTS Georgia Malakasioti, Christine Booth, Stephen Marks Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children, London, UK",

As whole exome sequencing becomes cheaper, utilizing this as an early non-invasive investigation in children with CKD appears inevitable but will manifest new challenges. Introduction: Moderate deficiency of ADAMTS13 may occur in other microangiopathic syndromes, because this enzyme limits the growth of thrombi in microcirculation. We conducted a comparative evaluation of ADAMTS13 activity in patients with STEC-HUS and atypical HUS (aHUS). Material and methods: A total of 64 patients were diagnosed with STEC-HUS (mean age 2.65 \u00b1 2 years) and 41 patients with aHUS (mean age 5.2 \u00b1 4 years). The activity of ADAMTS13 was determined by the FRET method (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) using the fluorogenic substrate FRETS-VWF73 (PeptaNova GmbH, Germany) and expressed as a percentage (%). The interval of activity of ADAMTS13 in healthy patients was 80-122%.",

STEC-HUS in all cases was associated with acute intestinal infection. The manifestation of aHUS in 29% was associated with acute renal injury, 22% with diarrhea, 10% with vaccination, and 12% with no trigger. The severity of anemia (65.2 \u00b1 12.7 vs 62 \u00b1 13 g/l), thrombocytopenia (60 \u00b1 35.5 vs 56 \u00b1 29 \u00d7 109 / L) did not differ in groups, but the average values of azotemia, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer were in 1.5 times higher in patients with STEC-HUS (462.6 \u00b1 202 vs 300 \u00b1 211.5 \u03bcmol/L, 3864.6 \u00b1 2983 vs 2580 \u00b1 1831 U/L, 3554.5 \u00b1 2495 vs 2050 \u00b1 1268).

Also, patients with STEC-HUS were needed dialysis in 1.5 times, and in artificial lung ventilation -2 times more often (93.7%vs63%, 20%vs7%) compared with patients with aHUS. Central nervous system lesions (seizures, coma) almost 2 times more often detected in children with STEC-HUS (40vs24.3%). Cardiovascular complications developed more often in patients with aHUS (78vs21%, p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Moderate deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity is more common in patients with STEC-HUS than with aHUS (78.1%vs66%). The severity of the HUS correlates with the activity of ADAMTS13. Decreasing of ADAMTS13 activity in patients with STEC-HUS may be associated with its consumption caused by shiga toxin endothelial dysfunction. Introduction: A 14-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital after he had bloody diarrhea, weakness, nausea and abdominal pain. Laboratory test results indicated a thrombotic microangiopathy (MTA). Material and methods: We documented low hemoglobin and platelet level, high LDH and Creatinine serum (Cs) levels and the presence of schistocytes in periphereal blood smear. ADAMTS 13 activity was normal and direct Coombs test was negative. Our patient was initially treated with plasma exchnge (PE) and hemodialysis. Before to begin PE a complement dysregulation test for mutation on CFH, CFI, MCP, CFB, CF3 and for anti CFH antibodies was conducted. Stool culture for STEC was negative. Few days after the onset of MTA the diagnosis of atpical hemoltic uremic syndrome (a-HUS) was made, a mutation on MCP was documented, and the patient was switched to eculizumab, after antibiotc prophylaxis and antimeningococcal vaccination was done.",

Introduction: Renal calyceal diverticulum is a cystic formation related to the pelvicalyceal system which is rarely diagnosed in childhood age group and can be confused with other cystic diseases of the kidney. Due to the relationship with the pelvicalyceal system, it can cause clinical symptoms such as infection, stone formation and hematuria. Material and methods: The children with a diagnosis simple renal cysts and with detailed ultrasonographic findings and advanced imaging results of the renal cyst were evaluated retrospectively according the their age, sex, presenting symptoms, simple renal cyst features (size, location) and advanced imaging results.Results: A total of 22 cases (11 girls) were evaluated. Mean ages were 10.5 \u00b1 3.9 (5-18) years. Simple renal cyst was detected in 13 left, 7 right kidney and two both of the kidneys. The mean size of the cysts were 21 \u00b1 11.5 (10-58) mm. The location of the cysts were 11 corticomedullary, 4 cortical, 6 medullary, and 1 parapelvic. All of the cases had been evaluated with MR urography as advanced imaging. MR urographic results showed that totally 7 calyceal diverticulum (31%) in all of the patients . The other 15 simple renal cysts diagnosis were confirmed as renal cyst. The presenting symptoms of cases with calyceal diverticulum were; 3 with abdominal pain, 2 with microscopic hematuria, 2 with urinary tract infection. Other cases were asymptomatic. Ultrasonographic cyst sizes of patients with diverticulum detected by MR urography were 20.8 \u00b1 6.1 mm (10-30) in average and there was no Introduction: The kidney is the organ with the highest post-biopsy clinically-relevant bleeding risk, estimated at 1.5-10% in pediatric patients. Gelfoam slurry tract embolization may improve post-biopsy outcomes. Material and methods: Retrospective review of 13 biopsies performed in 12 patients. A fully-automatic core-biopsy needle was used coaxially in all patients, (19/20-gauge in one patient, 17/18-gauge in the rest). Gelfoam slurry was performed by agitating gelfoam pledgets with normal saline until achieving slurry consistency, and injected at the completion of biopsy. All biopsies were completed with real-time pathologic verification using 4 or less needle passes. All patients were admitted overnight with ultrasound follow-up the next day. Results: Biopsy and gelfoam administration was technically successful during all biopsy sessions. One hematoma (1/13 biopsies, 7.9%) occurred in a patient with acute renal failure (Cr 2.3) increased from 3 mm to 12 mm on post-procedure day 1 but was clinically insignificant and required no treatment. One episode of hematuria (mild to moderate severity, 1/13, 7.9%) occurred in a patient with acute renal failure (Cr. 2.7) but was self-limited and required no treatment. Hemoglobin levels remained stable after the procedure (pre versus post-biopsy hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL versus 11.6 g/dL, within the range of error of the laboratory machine, p = 0.0173 paired student t-test). Creatinine levels (available at both time points for 10 biopsies) did not show a statistically significant increase after biopsy (0.82 pre versus 0.9 post, p = 0.2576 paired student t-test).Conclusions: In this small pilot series, there were no clinically significant complications (complications that require treatment or an unplanned elevation in level of care) in the cohort of patients who received gelfoam slurry embolization. Furthermore, creatinine levels remained at safe levels in the immediate term (any longer term follow-up of creatinine would be confounded by treatment response for the renal failure). Introduction: Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) is the major immunological cause of kidney transplant failure also in the paediatric population. According to current knowledge, late AMR is classically caused by the development of donor specific antibodies (DSA) and the complement system plays a critical role in its pathomechanism. The aim of this work was to determine the levels of various complement activation products in kidney transplant recipients. Material and methods: 106 adult kidney transplanted patients who had detectable DSA after transplantation (DSA+, 189 days to 29 years posttransplantation) were involved in the study. One hundred six DSAnegative patients were matched as controls using 1:1 propensity score matching. Two patients were excluded due to poor sample quality. The levels of complement activation products (C3a, SC5b-9, C4d and Bb) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using EDTA plasma samples.Results: Activation product levels were compared between the DSApositive and negative groups. Introduction: To describe a case of successful kidney transplant in a patient with Dense-deposit-disease (DDD), without recurrence of the initial pathology after prophylactic treatment with eculuzimab.Introduction: To analyze the long term outcome of a group of patients with DRTA and GS diagnosed in pediatric age. The underlying gene defect had been identified in all cases. Material and methods: Six Gypsy patients with GS, aged between 18 and 37 years, and 5 patients with DRTA, from 19 to 40 years of age, were studied after 17.6 \u00b1 3.3 and 21.0 \u00b1 10.8 years (X \u00b1 SD) of follow-up, respectively Final height (Z-Score), renal function (FGE: CKD-EPI formula), comorbidities, therapeutic compliance and quality of life by the SF-36 questionnaire were analyzed. Results: Only 2 DTRA and 1 GS patient reached the final height according to their genetic potential. FGE was normal except in 1 DRTA case (57 ml/min). All DRTA patients revealed a good adherence to potassium citrate treatment and to annual follow-up by a nephrology unit. All DRTA patients had nephrocalcinosis and hearing impairment. Only 2 out of the 6 GS cases declared an adequate compliance with magnesium and potassium supplements. Two patients received spironolactone. Two patients had several hospital admissions because of syncopal crisis. The rest of GS patients had refused to follow medical follow-up visits and did not take the treatment on their own initiative. The analysis of the quality of life showed that while GS patients presented the lower values in physical limitations and corporal pain, DRTA cases had the lower scores in social and emotional roles.Conclusions: Most adults having GS and DRTA diagnosed in pediatric age do not achieve their genetic height potential. They usually maintain a normal glomerular function rate. The adherence to treatment is good in DRTA patients and poor in GS individuals. The impact on the quality of life was greater on physical parameters in GS whereas DRTA patients reported a low score in regard with psychological items. Introduction: Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome (TINU) is a rare disorder occuring in less than 2% of cases of uveitis. Diagnosis requires the presence of both TIN and uveitis. The most common signs and symptoms of uveitis include photophobia, eye pain and redness, eyelid edema and progressive loss of vision. Renal impairment is characterized by abnormal renal function and abnormal urinalysis, symptoms of systemic illness, including fever, fatigue and weight loss. Material and methods: Case report 14 -year old boy treated for acute anterior uveitis was admitted to our department because of increased serum creatinine level. On admission, physical examination was normal and uveitis was in remission with only persistence of mild visual impairment of the right eye. He had no other clinical symptoms except of polyuria (4000 ml /day) and associated polydipsia. Results: Laboratory tests confirmed increased serum creatinine (189 \u03bcmol/L), other biochemical parameters were within normal reference range. Urinalysis showed normoglycemic glycosuria, non-nephrotic glomerulo-tubular proteinuria and high levels of \u03b2-2 microglobulin. Renal biopsy was consistent with tubulointerstitial nephritis, with chronic inflammatory changes and tubular atrophy. To complete the diagnostic work-up of TINU, we excluded infection, systemic and autoimmune causes. Because of persistent impairment of renal function we decided to use oral corticosteroids, which resulted in renal function improvement. However, after tapering of corticosteroids the boy had recurrence of uveitis and nephritis with decreased renal function. Treatment with topic and oral corticosteroids led to uveitis control, but renal functions remain impaired.",

Introduction: Cystinuria (OMIM 220100) is an autosomal disorder characterized by impaired epithelial cell transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids (lysine, ornithine, and arginine) in the proximal renal tubule and gastrointestinal tract. It is a rare, but important cause of urinary stone disease, that has high recurrence rate. Material and methods: We present the clinical case of 6.5 year old boy with cystinuria and complicated treatment of nephrolithiasis. Results: The boy was observed by the pediatrician from 4 months with a bilateral nephrolithiasis without urinary obstruction. The family history for renal lithiasis was negative. In 1 year old (IX/2011) renal colic was noted, after which -only in the left kidney stones were visualized. Urinalysis revealed numerous red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic examination, in the absence of proteinuria. Urine analytes such as calcium, oxalate, and uric acid were within normal ranges, cystinuria was not detected. At the age of 4.5 year old (II/2015) he had the signs of a repeated renal colic, and imaging studies, including ultrasonography, computer tomography demonstrated bilateral large radiodense calculi in left major calyx and left pelvis. Urologist evaluated the patient and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) on the left side was performed. During few weeks steinstrasse and ureter dilatation was developed, and repeat ESWL with cystoscopy was held (IV/2015). Chemical composition of a stone showed 100% cystine. Urine aminoacid analysis revealed increased levels of ornithine and arginine. Medical treatment was initiated with sodium bicarbonate to achieve urine alkalinization to a pH of 7.0 and captopril in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, and high fluid intake and a low-sodium diet was suggested. Within 2 months the signs of obstruction were increased, imaging studies ",
