The main presentation in both cases consisted of flu-like symptoms manifesting as, fever, arthralgias and myalgias. The virus was isolated in one case from a throat swab and in another case following a bronchoalveolar lavage. Both patients received oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg orally twice day. The dose of oseltamivir was increased to 150 mg twice per day due to the lack of improvement or progression of symptoms. In one case, clinical symptoms resolved without sequelae. In the second case, pulmonary symptomatology continued to deteriorate, despite aggressive polymicrobial treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation and ultimately the patient died from respiratory failure. These cases highlight the potentially serious effect of the ongoing Influenza A/pandemic 2009/ H1N1 pandemic in this very vulnerable population and the urgent need to establish emergency preparedness strategies by oncology and bone marrow transplantation staff to face this serious healthcare challenge.",

The virus was recognized as a novel reassorted H1N1 (swine-flu), also known as Influenza A/pandemic 2009/ H1N1 or 2009 H1N1 Influenza A. Similar cases were subsequently reported worldwide [1] . By June 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert due to rapid spread of the virus [2] . By August 2009, over 254,206 cases worldwide had been reported, resulting in 2,837 deaths. Given that countries are no longer required to report individual cases, it is highly probable that the reported cases represent an underestimation of the actual incidence of this disease [3] . In contrast to seasonal influenza, mortality from Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 appears worse in infants and young adults and those with morbid obesity. In addition, pregnant women appear to be at higher risk of mortality [3, 4] . The French Institute for Public Health Surveillance epidemic intelligence team evaluated the characteristics of 574 Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1-related deaths showing that pregnancy and obesity are particularly concerning [4] .",

For instance, the patient in case 1 was treated within 24 h of presentation, whereas, the patient in case 2 was treated with levofloxacin before receiving oseltamivir. In fact, her CXR had shown signs of respiratory inflammation likely related to ongoing viral replication. Identification of Aspergillus (Case 2) also raises concern about prolonged immunosuppression and already existing lung damage. She died due to overwhelming ARDS. Machado et al. has described the beneficial effects of early administration of antiviral therapy in AHCT recipients showing that administration of oseltamivir up to 48 h from initial symptoms is likely to prevent influenza, albeit non-2009/H1N1 Influenza A, complications [9] .

[16] reported outcomes of 21 episodes of influenza (influenza A = 8, influenza B = 13) in 19 hematopoietic allograft recipients. In their series, 18 (86%) of 21 episodes were treated with oseltamivir 75 mg twice a day for a median of 11 (interquartile range = 8-14) days and all of them survived [16] . Kobayashi et al. described a patient who developed influenza A 5 days prior to hematopoietic cell allografting. Interestingly, despite oseltamivir treatment at a dose of 75 mg twice a day for 5 days, the patient had recurrence of influenza A (by rapid diagnostic test) on post-transplant day ?7 manifesting as upper respiratory symptoms accompanied by fever [17] . Subsequent treatment with oseltamivir for seven additional days resulted in resolution of symptoms and a negative influenza A rapid diagnostic test. The authors suggest that patients who develop influenza infections during the immediate pre-transplant period should be treated with antiviral therapy at least until successful engraftment is achieved [17] .",
