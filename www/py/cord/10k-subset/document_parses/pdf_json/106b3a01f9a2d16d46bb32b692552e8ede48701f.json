At this time, a total of 5 novel antibody therapeutics (romosozumab, risankizumab, polatuzumab vedotin, brolucizumab, and crizanlizumab) had been granted a first approval in either the US or EU, and marketing applications for 13 novel antibody therapeutics (eptinezumab, teprotumumab, enfortumab vedotin, isatuximab, [fam-]trastuzumab deruxtecan, inebilizumab, leronlimab, sacituzumab govitecan, satralizumab, narsoplimab, tafasitamab, REGNEB3 and naxituximab) were undergoing review in these regions, which represent the major markets for antibody therapeutics. Also as of November 2019, 79 novel antibodies were undergoing evaluation in late-stage clinical studies. Of the 79 antibodies, 39 were undergoing evaluation in late-stage studies for non-cancer indications, with 2 of these (ublituximab, pamrevlumab) also in late-stage studies for cancer indications. Companies developing 7 (tanezumab, aducanumab, evinacumab, etrolizumab, sutimlimab, anifrolumab, and teplizumab) of the 39 drugs have indicated that they may submit a marketing application in either the US or EU in 2020. Of the 79 antibodies in late-stage studies, 40 were undergoing evaluation as treatments for cancer, and potentially 9 of these (belantamab mafodotin, oportuzumab monatox, margetuximab, dostarlimab, spartalizumab, 131I-omburtamab, loncastuximab tesirine, balstilimab, and zalifrelimab) may enter regulatory review in late 2019 or in 2020.

In particular, we have focused on first transitions of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), (e.g., first approval in either the United States (US) or European Union (EU)) as a measure of innovation and success. This approach is stringent, as it necessarily excludes any subsequent development from the quantitative assessment. For example, if a product is first approved in the US, any subsequent approval in the EU or supplemental approval is not included in the product totals. By this measure, the number of antibody therapeutic products approved in 2019, as of November, (5 products) is the lowest since 2013, when only 2 products were approved.

Aducanumab (BIIB037) is a human anti-amyloid beta (A\u03b2) IgG1 mAb studied for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.

In September 2016 the FDA granted aducanumab Fast Track designation, and in April 2017 aducanumab was accepted into MHLW's Sakigake Designation System.
