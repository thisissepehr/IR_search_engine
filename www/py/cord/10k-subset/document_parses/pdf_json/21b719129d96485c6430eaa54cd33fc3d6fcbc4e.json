First, there is a wide range of literature (Borensztein et al. 1998; Yanikkaya 2003) which argues that trade openness and FDI increase economic growth significantly. If trade openness and FDI are positively related to GDP per capita, it will be beneficial for life expectancy as higher income helps to afford better food and nutrition, housing, health care treatment and investment in better living and working conditions that significantly increase life expectancy. Second, trade openness and FDI positively affect education levels, including literacy level of household which in turn positively influences health and life expectancy. The third channel is the technology transfer effect from developed countries to developing ones since pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) is highly concentrated in a small group of developed countries that export these goods to the rest of the developing world (Papageorgiou et al. 2007) . As many studies (e.g. Xu and Wang 2000; Ciruelos and Wang 2005) have found that trade openness and FDI are the means of technology diffusion, public health in a developing country can be improved through the increased access to new technologies for water sanitation, medical treatment and pharmaceuticals.

According to World Bank (2015), life expectancy (at birth) in Pakistan has improved significantly from 55 years in 1972 to 67 years in 2013. At the same time, the country has opened its economy and experienced a rapid growth in terms of trade. Furthermore, suffering various domestic and international wars, enormous political instability and the rise of numerous terrorist groups, Pakistan has managed to receive a large amount of FDI of US$1308 million in 2013 which is 78 times more than 1972. These points motivate us to examine the impact of trade openness and FDI on life expectancy in the case of Pakistan. This paper contributes in existing literature in the following five ways. First, this is the first study that employs long time series data to investigate the dynamic relationship between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy. Second, we apply both conventional and structural break unit root tests for examining the stationary properties of the variables. Third, in the presence of structural breaks, we employ the bounds testing approach to find whether cointegration exists or not and the robustness of cointegration is checked by applying combined cointegration. Fourth, the rolling-window approach is used for measuring the long-run impact of economic growth and FDI on life expectancy. Finally, the causal relationship between the variables is investigated by using the VECM Granger causality approach. The empirical results confirm the presence of cointegration amid the variables. The results also show that trade openness and FDI play positive roles in enhancing life expectancy. Finally, the unidirectional causality is found running from trade openness and FDI to life expectancy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The paper is organised as follows.

Plenty of theoretical literature is available which argues that trade may have a significant positive impact on life expectancy in developing countries. For example, Romer (1989) is one of the pioneer studies which argues that trade openness facilitates interactions among the nations that increase the general flow of knowledge which helps domestic producers to enhance their productivity and economic growth. The higher economic growth helps to increase household income and promote better access to health facilities. Stark (2004) claims that trade openness increases education levels and raises consciousness of health among the mass people which contribute to the improvement of their life expectancy. Moreover, Deaton (2004) emphasizes that the closer integration of an economy improves public health as openness transmits health-related expertise and knowledge. Hawkes (2007) contends that trade liberalization declines the proportion of child and adult undernourishment as it allows greater availability of highly processed, calorie-rich and nutritious food in developing countries. However, Bezuneh and Yiheyis (2014) have challenged the findings of Hawkes (2007) . From a panel data set of 37 developing countries, the study provides new evidence that trade liberalization has a negative effect on food availability which may have detrimental effects on public health in the case of developing countries. Papageorgiou et al. (2007) reveal that medical technology diffusion through trade openness is one of the important factors for recent health development in many developing countries. Employing cross-sectional data of 67 technology-importing countries, the study suggests that the importing of medical technology is a significant contributor to improved life expectancy in many less developed countries. However, Kawachi and Wamala (2006) suggest that economic integration through free movement of goods and capital may create a threat to public health through the faster spread of infectious diseases such as SARS and HIV. Blouin et al. (2009) have published a series of papers on 'trade and health' in 'The Lancet', one of the leading health journals, where the authors express a concern that, although trade may improve public health by raising the living standard and providing access to medical goods, it may be detrimental to public health in various ways, including economic distress, income inequality, environmental pollution and the availability of unhealthy products, such as tobacco, alcohol and canned foods.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 275, "end": 287, "text": "Romer (1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 630, "end": 642, "text": "Stark (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 826, "end": 839, "text": "Deaton (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 978, "end": 991, "text": "Hawkes (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1235, "text": "Bezuneh and Yiheyis (2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1281, "text": "Hawkes (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1550, "text": "Papageorgiou et al.

Wei and Wu (2002) is one of the pioneer studies that empirically explores the connection between trade openness and public health status. Considering a lower tariff rate as a proxy for trade openness, the study suggests that higher trade openness is linked to a longer life expectancy and a lower infant mortality rate. Levine and Rothman (2006) investigate whether openness to international trade affects children's health or not. They use cross-sectional data from 130 countries and report that trade openness helps to reduce infant mortality, child mortality and malnutrition. Subsequently, Owen and Wu (2007) examine the effect of trade on various health outcomes in a large panel data set of 219 countries across the world. From the fixed-effect model, the study provides empirical evidence that increased trade openness is related to lower rates of infant mortality and higher life expectancy, particularly in the case of developing countries. Moreover, they argue that trade openness is linked to sound economic policies which themselves are related to better health outcomes. Bussmann (2009) examines whether trade openness has any significant impact on health improvements in 134 countries. Using trade/GDP as a proxy for trade openness, their results fail to provide any evidence that trade openness has a significant positive impact on women's health and their life expectancy. However, this result might be questioned since the study has used interpolated data for missing years. As trade/GDP fluctuates from year to year, and changes in health outcomes likely evolve over a number of years, the interpolation is unlikely to capture any effects of trade on life expectancy. Stevens et al. (2013) have examined the relationship between trade openness and health in a large set of countries. They employ the fixed-effect model and conclude that trade has a significant positive impact on population health in the low-income countries. However, their analysis finds that the relationship between income and health is nonlinear. The effect of trade openness on health decreases as income level increases and becomes negative at high levels of income. Trade openness is positively associated with income and health at a decreasing rate to a certain threshold and after that, it has no significant impact on public health. This finding is supported by arguing that trade openness could be harmful to health in high-income countries where higher income is associated with long working hours, more mental pressure, less sleep and increased consumption of unhealthy products. Very recently, Herzer (2015) analyses the long-run impact of trade openness on population health by applying cointegration techniques to the US time series data for the period 1960-2011. Using various time series techniques, the findings of the study suggest that trade has a positive and significant long-run impact on population health measured by life expectancy. Nevertheless, Lin et al. (2015) investigate whether trade reduces infant mortality in the case of least developing countries (LDC) during the period of 1995-2012. From a panel of 48 LDCs, the study finds that trade does not help to decrease child mortality. Indeed, the study reports that trade could even increase child mortality through raising environmental pollution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 182, "text": "Wei and Wu (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 485, "end": 510, "text": "Levine and Rothman (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 759, "end": 777, "text": "Owen and Wu (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1264, "text": "Bussmann (2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1872, "text": "Stevens et al.

The bounds testing analysis seems to suggest the rejection of the null hypothesis of no cointegration because the calculated F-statistic is greater than the upper bound critical value at 1 % level of significance. It supports the alternative hypothesis that the valid long-run relationship exists between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy in Pakistan. Table 5 shows the results of long-run and short-run analysis. We find that trade openness and FDI are major contributing factors to increase life expectancy in Pakistan. The results show the positive and significant effect of trade openness on life expectancy in Pakistan. A 1 % increase in trade openness causes an increase in life expectancy by 0.364 %. This finding is consistent with Herzer (2015) and Owen and Wu (2007) who reported that trade openness increases life expectancy. FDI is positively and significantly linked with life expectancy. A 1 % increase in FDI improves life expectancy by 0.159 % keeping other things constant.

The rolling window analysis is a time varying technique which is used to analyze the behavior of regressors and models of different time periods. The rolling window analysis provides the coefficients of regressors for each year in the sample period. This technique helps to identify the behavior of considered variables throughout the sample period (year-wise). The results of rolling coefficients of considered regressors are discussed in Figs. 1 and 2. Figures 1 and 2 deal with the impact of trade openness and FDI on life expectancy, respectively. The results reported in Fig. 1 suggest that trade openness had a positive impact on life expectancy from 1979 to 2005. However, the effect became negative for 2 years between 2006 and 2007 and after that, it became positive again. Overall, the negative effect of trade openness is found only for 2 years while a positive impact is found for 33 years. This positive relation of 33 years shows that trade openness positively affects life expectancy for a longer time period. The highest contribution of trade openness on life expectancy is seen in 1995 with the coefficient of 0.4929 due to more liberalized economic policies regarding health, such as, the social action program (SAP) implemented in 1990s by the Pakistani government. This confirms that the contribution of trade openness on life expectancy remained positive over the last three decades in Pakistan. Figure 2 indicates that FDI has a positive impact on life expectancy over the period of 1981-1992 and 1997-2013. However, it has a negative effect over the period of 1993-1996. The negative effect of FDI on life expectancy is found for only 5 years compared to a positive impact of 30 years.

Figure 3 presents the results of CUSUM and CUSUM of square tests, respectively. The analysis indicates that the statistics of both CUSUM and CUSUM of square test lie within the interval bands at 5 % confidence interval. This suggests that there is no structural instability in the residuals of equation of life expectancy in Pakistan. We conclude that short-run estimates are stable and robust. The confirmation of cointegration between the variables leads us to investigate the direction of Granger causality between the variables. The Granger theorem suggests that there will be Granger causality in at least one direction if the cointegration relationship exists between the variables, provided that the variables are integrated of order one or I(1). Engle and Granger (1987) have cautioned that if the Granger causality test is conducted at first difference through vector auto regression (VAR) method, then it will be misleading in the presence of cointegration. Therefore, the inclusion of an additional variable to the VAR method such as the error correction term would help us to capture the long-run causal relationship. The VECM causality analysis provides three sources of causation if variables are found to be cointegrated such as (a) short-run Granger causality, (b) long-run Granger causality and (c) joint long-and short-run (overall) Granger causality.

Moreover, there is inadequate knowledge about the dynamic relationships between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy by using time series techniques. In this study, we have aimed to explore the dynamic relationships between trade openness, FDI and life expectancy in the case of Pakistan for the period 1972-2013. The combined cointegration approach of Bayer and Hanck (2013) has been used to examine the long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. Moreover, we apply the ARDL approach to measure the long-run and short-run impact of trade openness and FDI on life expectancy. The empirical evidence confirms the presence of cointegration amid the variables. Furthermore, trade openness increases population health measured by life expectancy. FDI has also a positive impact on life expectancy. The unidirectional causality exists running from trade openness and FDI to life expectancy. The results derived from this study have some important policy implications. The key findings suggest that trade openness and FDI contribute to life expectancy significantly in Pakistan. Hence, the government of Pakistan should use trade openness and FDI as economic tools not only for enhancing domestic production but also for improving health of its massive population. Therefore, we recommend that policy makers should introduce more trade liberalization and foreign investment friendly policies that will ensure the maximum economic and social benefits. We also suggest that the social benefits of trade and FDI will be more potent if the policy makers can ensure greater international trade and foreign investment particularly in the health sector. Hence, new developments of medical science including health care services and technologies should be traded without any tariff barriers. Moreover, foreign affiliates should largely invest in hospital and pharmaceutical sectors by bringing modern know-how and technology from their host countries which will directly benefit to the public health of the host countries.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 577, "end": 599, "text": "Bayer and Hanck (2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Policy Recommendations"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Co-integration, error correction, and the econometric analysis of non-stationary data", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Banerjee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Dolado", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Galbraith", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Hendry", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1993, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Combining non-cointegration tests", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Bayer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Hanck", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Journal of Time Series Analysis", "volume": "34", "issn": "1", "pages": "83--95", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Good for living?
