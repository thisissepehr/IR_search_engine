The glycoprotein D of HSV-2 (gD2) is a promising subunit vaccine candidate for the treatment of genital herpes. The aim of the present study was to express a biologically active recombinant gD2 in eukaryotic baculovirus system in quantities sufficient for further studies. Human cDNA encoding a gD2 protein with 393 amino acids was subcloned into the pFastBac HTb vector and the recombinant protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by high-density cell culture. In a stirred bioreactor, the key limiting factors including glucose concentration, glutamine concentration and dissolved oxygen (DO) were optimized for high-density cell growth. The Sf9 cell density could reach 9.6\u00d710 6 cells/mL and the yield of recombinant gD2 protein was up to 192 mg/L in cell culture under the optimal conditions of 15 mM glucose, 0.4 g/L glutamine and 40% DO. Production of significant amounts of pure, full-length gD2 opened up the possibility to investigate novel functions of gD2. Moreover, the purified recombinant gD2 protein revealed a partial prophylactic immune function in genital herpes of guinea pigs infected with HSV-2.",

Agitation rate was initially set to 50 rpm and progressively increased to 150 rpm. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was maintained at the proper range by regulating the flow of compressed and highly purified nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and air. The pH was controlled at 6.2 by adding 0.25 M HCl or 0.2 M NaOH. Nutrient solutions were composed from 15% (w/v) glucose solution, 2% (w/v) glutamine solution and amino acid solution (containing 50 mM cysteine, 50 mM lysine and 80 mM methionine). All were filtered with a 0.22 \u00b5m sterile filter. Samples were collected every 24 h for cell counting and metabolic analysis.

High-cell density fermentation offers many advantages including increased productivity, reduced cost, labour-saving technique allowing the elimination of hundreds of flasks and reduced risk of contamination compared with other traditional methods. As for the insect cell/baculovirus expression system, high cell density can guarantee the highly effective production of protein. We initiated this study for optimizing the cultural conditions of Sf9 cells at high cell density to produce a large amount of recombinant gD2. Because glucose, glutamine and DO are the most essential factors affecting cell growth and viability of Sf9 cells, these factors have been investigated with the aim of increasing the final cell density. In this study, the concentrations of glucose, glutamine and DO were optimized in the feeding process. Higher cell density could be achieved at the conditions of 15 mM glucose and 0.4 g/L glutamine. In contrast, lower concentrations of glucose and glutamine could not provide enough carbohydrate for cell metabolism and propagation, and higher concentrations of glucose and glutamine were not beneficial to cell growth due to the production of extra lactic acid or ammonia. A stable oxygen level is essential in insect cell culture. Good DO control ensures that cell growth is not limited by oxygen. Many studies have proven that different culture system including cell lines and medium have various demand of oxygen. Here, cell growth could be inhibited by oxygen at the middle and late phases of fermentation when the apparent concentration of DO was more than 40%. Maybe, excessive DO conditions can bring the formation of nascent oxygen, superoxide and peroxide which destroy cellular components and then destroy the cell growth.",

Our results indicated that the immunization of recombinant gD2 greatly increased neutralizing antibody level and highly reduced lesion scores in guinea pigs infected with HSV-2 when compared with the animals treated with PBS alone. Compared with the results by Fotouhi et al. (2008) , the neutralizing antibody titers were higher in our study, which might be due to the purified recombinant gD2 with stronger immunogenicity in our study and the crude cell culture with lower immunogenicity to immunize guinea pigs in Fotouhi et al. (2008) study. The immunity between the recombinant gD2-immunized group and the commercially gD2-immunized group did not exhibit a significant difference, which suggested that bioactive recombinant gD2 was expressed successfully.",

The baculovirus expression system and fed-batch cultivation provided a valuable and reproducible source to produce substantial amounts of purified, immunogenic and protective vaccine candidate of recombinant gD2 for genital herpes model of guinea pigs infected with HSV-2. Further studies focused on optimizing the vaccine protection of the gD2 with various adjuvants and doses are underway.",
