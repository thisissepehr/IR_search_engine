Sites of vulnerability on HIV-1 Env have been identified with bnAbs isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals [1] [2] [3] and passively administered bnAbs have prevented the infection of rhesus macaques by challenges with chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) [4] [5] [6] [7] . Subsets of bnAbs have long third heavy chain complementarity regions (CDRH3s) associated with poly-or autoreactive B cell receptors (BCRs) and can predispose B cells to immune tolerance control 8, 9 . Moreover, in addition to the HIV Env polypeptide backbone, many bnAbs also interact with Env host-derived glycans or viron lipids [9] [10] [11] [12] . Thus, the maturation of B-cell lineages towards bnAb activity can be hindered by immune tolerance controls 13, 14 .",

Comparative analysis of cohorts of HIV-1 infected individuals who make bnAbs vs. those who do not have demonstrated subjects who make bnAbs during HIV-1 infection have higher levels of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells 16, 17 , lower levels of T regulatory cells, and a higher frequency of auto-antibodies compared to those who do not make bnAbs 17 . Recently, we demonstrated the association of dysfunctional NK cells with the ability to produce bnAbs in the setting of HIV-1 infection 18 . Thus, immunoregulatory abnormalities are associated with bnAb development in HIV-1-infected individuals, suggesting that transiently recreating the HIV-1-modified immunoregulatory milieu at the time of vaccination may be crucial to the induction of clonal lineages of bnAb B cells with full neutralization breadth 13, 14, 17 .",

Overall, humoral responses become enhanced in the absence of CTLA-4 30 . However, studies in which PD-1 interaction with its ligands has been disrupted by gene deficiency or antibody blockade have given more complex results, with enhancement of Tfh responses and humoral immunity being observed in some cases 31 , but negative effects observed in others, perhaps due to the role of PD-1 in control of CD4 Tfr numbers and suppressive capacity 32 .

Cynomolgus macaques (n = 16) were immunized twice with a near-native CH848 gp140 stabilized SOSIP trimer with the asparagine (N) 301 glycosylation site removed to enhance V3glycan unmutated common ancestor antibody (UCA) binding, followed by sequential boosts with variants of the CH848 trimer designed to sequentially replace either N301 or V1 glycans (Fig. 1e ). Monkeys were co-administered CTLA-4 or control antibodies at weeks 4, 10, and 16 with SOSIP trimers (Fig. 1e) . Antibody binding to the CH848 wild-type (WT) SOSIP trimer with all of the glycans intact was measured by ELISA after 3rd, 4th, and 5th immunizations at weeks 12, 18 and 24, respectively. At each timepoint, CTLA-4 Ab-treated animals had trends for higher SOSIP trimer binding titers compared with controls, and statistically significantly higher titers at week 24 (P = 0.03, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney; Fig. 1f ). Similarly, CTLA-4 Abtreated animals had trends for higher average titers of antibodies that could block the DH270 bnAb binding to the CH848 Env at weeks 12, 18, and 24 after the 3rd, 4th, and 5th immunizations, indicating induction of antibodies that overlap with the DH270 bnAb epitope (Fig. 1g ). Lastly, we tested autologous neutralization against tier-2 (difficult-to-neutralize) CH848 10.17 DT virus at weeks 12, 18, and 24 after immunization. There was no neutralization detected above an ID50 of 100 after 3 immunizations, but after the 4th immunization, 2 of 4 CTLA-4 Ab treated animals had reproducible serum tier-2 autologous HIV-1 CH848 10.17 DT neutralization (mean ID50 titer of 237.8), while no neutralization was detected in any of the animals in the control Ab treated group (Fig. 1h) . After five immunizations at week 24, 3 of the 4 CTLA-4 Ab treated animals had detectable serum autologous tier-2 neutralization activity (mean ID50 titer of 652.0) (Fig. 1h) . When serum antibody binding, blocking and neutralization were combined into a serum antibody composite score, animals treated with CTLA-4 Ab had significantly higher scores at week 24 compared to control or other groups and averaged higher at weeks 12 and 18 (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney; Fig. 1i ). Although the sample size of each macaque study precluded individual measurements from reaching a statistically significant threshold of P \u2264 0.05 (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney), the trends observed for multiple measurements within two independent macaque studies suggested that during HIV-1 Env immunization in macaques, CTLA-4 blockade could increase the titers and change the quality of the neutralization response to Env by promoting induction of autologous tier-2 neutralizing antibodies.",

We identified 74, 120, and 92 transcripts that were significantly different in CTLA-4, PD-1 and CTLA-4 + PD-1 Ab groups compared to control monkeys, respectively with some differentially regulated transcripts being shared among groups (Fig. 3a, b ; Supplementary Data 1-3). Of 13 differentially-expressed transcripts that were common to the CTLA-4 and CTLA-4 + PD-1 Ab-treated groups, 11 were upregulated, 10 of which are involved in T cell proliferation and activation, including transcripts that encode KI67 (MCM5, BIRC5, MKI67, ZBP1, TK1, NCAPG, MYBL2, NBL1, CDT1, IFI27), plus 1 transcript involved in cell adhesion (MY01F), and 2 transcripts were downregulated, which have uncharacterized functions (FAM60A, ENSMMUG00000009155; Fig. 3b ). We also found other transcripts previously shown to be involved in T cell activation (RRM2, E2F8, TLR2, SECTM1, FOXM1) that were upregulated in either the CTLA-4 or the CTLA-4 + PD-1 Ab groups individually, when compared to control monkeys. These transcripts were more highly expressed than in control monkeys, and were also more highly-expressed relative to the PD-1 Abtreated animals. Moreover, PD-1 Ab-treated monkeys had upregulation of transcripts associated with decreased memory T cell responses (SLA) and T cell anergy (NDRG1) 39, 40 (Supplementary Data 2). Performance of enriched pathway analysis of the transcripts changed in the PD-1 treated animals compared with controls demonstrated significant upregulation of transcripts involved with cellular inhibition of activation ( Supplementary  Fig. 3B ). These data demonstrated that CTLA-4 Ab treatment increased transcripts associated with T cell proliferation and activation, while PD-1 Ab-treated monkeys had upregulation of transcripts associated with CD4 T cell inhibition of activation and proliferation (SLA, NDRG1, FOXP3, IFNG, OSM, SEMA7A, SERPINE1, TGFB1, VDR, CSF1, FASLG).",

Seven days after the second CH505 gp120 Env immunization and CTLA-4 or PD-1 Ab antibody co-administration, LN samples were collected from all monkeys (Macaque study no. 1). There were no significant differences in the proportion of germinal center (GC) B cells in the LN between CTLA-4, PD-1, CTLA-4 + PD-1 and control Ab treated animals with frequencies of GC B cells averaging between 1.7 and 2.7% of total B cells in each group (Fig. 4b) . There was also no statistically significant difference between the proportions of Tfh cells between the antibody treatment groups, with group average frequencies of Tfh cells between 1.5-2.3% of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4c ). Animals treated with PD-1 Ab had higher average frequencies (NS, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney) and animals treated with CTLA-4 + PD-1 Abs had significantly (P = 0.03, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney) higher frequencies of Tfr cells compared with control Ab treated animals with greater than 2.8-fold average frequency of Tfr in PD-1 or combination treated groups (Fig. 4d) . These data suggested that PD-1 blockade increased the proportions of T regulatory cells in draining lymph nodes. Ki67 is expressed on activated and proliferating T cells. Animals treated with CTLA-4, PD-1 and CTLA-4 + PD-1 all had significantly higher proportions of Ki67 + Tfh cells (*P < 0.05, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney; Fig. 4e ). Similarly, LN biopsies were obtained seven days after three immunizations and two antibody co-administrations from all animals in each group in the CH848 SOSIP trimer immunized animals (Macaque study no. 2). Similar to Macaque study no. 1, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of GC B cells, Tfh cells or Tfr cells between CTLA-4 Ab-treated and control Ab treated macaques (Fig. 4f-h) . Animals treated with CTLA-4 Ab had a trend of higher average frequencies of Ki67+ CD4 Tfh cells with CTLA-4 Ab-treated macaques just missing the significance threshold (P = 0.06, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Fig. 4i ). Thus, CTLA-4 Ab treatment did not significantly modify the proportions of GC B, Tfh or Tfr cells, but there were alternations in Tfr cell frequencies in the PD-1 Ab treatment group. Treatment with all immune checkpoint Abs resulted in higher average proportions of Ki67+ T cells after immunization. Measurement of overall health biomarkers during blockade. Immune checkpoint blockade using therapeutic antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-1 for cancer immunotherapy results in autoimmune clinical syndromes in a proportion of individuals 21, 43 . None of the macaques treated with CTLA-4 Ab had manifestations of clinical autoimmune disease or any adverse events related to drug or immunization administration during the study. One macaque in the PD-1 Ab treatment group had to be euthanized during the study after all immunizations were completed and histopathology revealed evidence of inflammatory ulcerative dermatitis in a tail lesion. Moreover, we performed blood chemistry and hematology tests throughout each macaque study, and most tests were within normal range with the exceptions noted below ( Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) . After vaccination at week 6, there were trends for lower red blood cell, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in all macaques with no significant differences detected between control Ab and CTLA-4 or PD-1 treated macaques indicating this trend was unrelated to Ab treatment and was likely due to frequent blood and tissue sampling during study (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Animals treated with PD-1 Ab had a modest reduction in white blood cell counts after vaccination that was significantly lower than control Ab treated animals (P < 0.03, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney; Supplementary  Fig. 4) .",

No animals had detectable pre-existing positive autoantibody titers to these antigens and control animals remained negative throughout immunization ( Supplementary Fig. 1H ). For monkeys treated with CTLA-4 or PD-1 Ab after one immunization, two CTLA-4 + PD-1 Ab-treated macaques were positive for Abs to a single autoAg (SCL-70 and RNP antigens, respectively), and after 2 immunizations, one PD-1 and one CTLA-4 + PD-1 Ab-treated monkey exhibited reactivity to a single autoAg (SCL-70 antigen). After 4 immunizations, 5 of the 8 animals treated with CTLA-4 or CTLA-4 + PD-1 Ab, respectively, had positive autoAg antibody titers to Scl-70, histone and RNP antigens ( Supplementary  Fig. 1H ). Thus, transient administration of CTLA-4 or PD-1 Ab treatment was associated with macaque plasma autoantibody seropositivity.",

To study VRC01-class, CD4 binding site bnAb development 44 , a mouse model was engineered to produce diverse repertoires of VRC01-like precursors. In this model, human VH1-2*02 segment can recombine with the whole set of mouse D segments and the human J H 2 segment to create a repertoire of diverse Ig heavy chains with a wide range of CDR H3s (Supplementary Fig. 6A ). This model is similar to a previously reported version, but with the additional replacement of the mouse J H segments with the human J H 2 segment 45 . Human J H 2 segment can contribute a conserved tyrosine residue in the CDR H3 of VRC01-class antibodies, and the incorporation of human J H 2 segment may increase the frequencies of VRC01-like precursors in this mouse model. The VH1-2 heavy chains pair with a rearranged germline form of the VRC01 kappa light chain (gl-VRC01-LC), which contains the signature five-amino acid CDRL3 of VRC01-class antibodies necessary for VRC01-like bnAb precursors (Supplementary Fig. 6A ). We utilized a stepwise immunization regimen to engage the VRC01-like germline precursors and to select for neutralizing capability, as previously described 45 . Specifically, we primed with eOD-GT8-60mer particles that have been demonstrated to engage VRC01-class precursors 46 , then boosted five-times with a series of immunogens starting with a 426c gp120 core Env with glycans deleted near the CD4 binding site (N276, N460, N463; degly3) multimerized on a ferritin particle; subsequent immunogens were the 426c core Env protein with serial additions of deleted glycans (426c-degly2 and 426c-degly1, the latter lacking N276 only) followed by the fully glycosylated 426c gp120 wt core and finally, the 426c-WT nativelike SOSIP trimer 45, 47 . Along with the last two immunizations of the 426c gp120 wt core and 426c-WT SOSIP trimer, we administered CTLA-4 blocking antibody (n = 4, Group 1), OX40 agonist antibody (n = 4, Group 2), or a control group that received isotype control antibody (n = 2); or saline alone (n = 2). These animals were combined as the control group. All animals were harvested a week after the last immunization with the 426c-WT native-like SOSIP trimer to measure blood and tissue immune responses (Fig. 5a) .",

We found that there were no significant differences in the distribution of CDR H3 lengths or median mutation frequencies of the mouse Ig genes between the antibody treatment or control groups (Supplementary Fig. 6D ). Next, we determined the frequency of mouse variable heavy gene segment usage in the GC B cells from each group, and we found that the control and OX40 Ab-treated group used a diverse array of IGHV segments with IGHV3-1 and IGHV2-6 being among the most frequent ( Supplementary Fig. S6E) . Surprisingly, 15.5% and 18.7% of the CTLA-4 Ab treated groups sequences utilized IGHV2-6 and IGHV3-1, indicating a more selected mouse Ig repertoire ( Supplementary Fig. 6E ). This is reflected in lower entropy value that is a measure of overall gene usuage diversity of 3.26 in the CTLA-4 Ab treated animals compared to control groups (3.66 Supplementary Fig. 6E) . Thus, treatment of VRC01 precursor KI mice with CTLA-4 Ab resulted in an altered GC B cell repertoire with increased usuage of select endogenous mouse heavy chain genes, whereas OX40 Ab treatment augmented somatic hypermutation frequency of the human IGVH1-2 bnAb precursor gene.",

Dimensionality reduction by tSNE and graph-based clustering identified 13 distinct transcriptional clusters (Fig. 7a) . By using known transcripts and determining significantly upregulated genes in each cluster, we were able to identify major populations of immune cells such as B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as less common immune cell populations, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils (Fig. 7b, c) . Cells within immune cell clusters from the CTLA-4 Ab (red) and control antibodytreated (blue) mice clustered near each other, indicating overall similarity of the individual cell transcriptional profiles (Fig. 7d) . In contrast, cells from the OX40 Ab-treated mice (green) formed distinct clusters in the B cell, CD4 and CD8 T cell immune cell clusters compared to control cells (blue), suggesting distinct transcriptional changes in OX40 Ab-administered mouse cells (Fig. 7d) Next, we analyzed genes in B cells (cluster 0, Cd79a positive) that were differentially expressed between CTLA-4 or OX40 Abtreated mice compared with control animals (Fig. 7f) .

While any clinical autoimmune side effects of such treatments will be unacceptable in the setting of vaccination of healthy individuals, it is possible that transient treatment with these or similar immunomodulators may allow for expansion of bnAb precursors by UCA-targeting Envs, thus allowing sequential Env immunizations to be more successful in selecting for affinity mature bnAbs. When CTLA-4 Ab is frequently administered over long periods of time when treating malignancy. Here, we show that CTLA-4 Ab treatment can enhance HIV-1 neutralizing antibody induction after only two or three administrations. We found that in the bnAb KI mouse CTLA-4 Ab treatment did alter the GC B cell repertoire and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 treated macaques were associated with increase in serum autoAgs. In contrast, OX40 treated mice did have an increase in GC B cells, they did not exhibit an increase in GC VH sequences that were not of bnAb origin. Moreover, OX40 Ab-treated mice had an increased fraction of GC VH sequences that had increased mutation frequency compared to control groups. While OX40 Ab treatment can facilitate tumor rejection in mice 71 , blockade of OX40 has been associated with a reduction in CD4-driven autoimmunity 72 . Thus, any use of CTLA-4 or OX40 Abs as adjuvants for Env vaccination will have to be used transiently and it will be important to clearly demonstrate that, as used, there is no induction of manifestations of autoimmune disease. Design of delivery systems to deliver or express CTLA-4 antibody or OX40 Abs locally in draining LNs may serve to localize and limit systemic effects of checkpoint inhibition.",

To produce biotinylated CH0848 10.17DT SOSIP gp140s, the envelope sequence was expressed with a C-terminal avidin tag (AviTag: GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE). After antibody affinity chromatography and eluate concentration, the envelope was dialyzed for 1 h in 10 mM Tris pH8. Envelope was biotinylated with the BirA biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit (Avidity). The ligation reaction was done by agitating 25 \u00b5M of SOSIP trimer at 900 rpm at 30\u00b0C for 5 h. The biotinylated protein was then concentrated to 2 mL for size exclusion chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography was performed with a Superose6 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing trimeric HIV-1 Env protein were pooled together, sterile-filtered, snap frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Eight Cynomologus macaques were immunized with sequential SOSIP trimers and coadministered antibodies in 2 groups (n = 4/group) with 10 mg/kg Ipilipumamb (Bristol-Myers-Squibb), or control CH65 anti-HA at 10 mg/kg by IV infusion. Monkeys were housed at Bioqual, Rockville, MD. The animals were maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and Duke University guidelines and all studies were approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.",

Non-specific binding of a preimmune sample was subtracted from each post-immunization IgG sample binding data. Data analyses were performed with BIA-evaluation 4.1 software (BIAcore/ GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Binding responses were measured by averaging post-injection response unit (RU) over a 10 s window; and dissociation rate constant, kd (second-1), was measured during the post-injection phase after stabilization of signal. Positive response was defined when both replicates have a RU value \u226510. Relative avidity binding score is calculated as follows: Avidity score (RU.s) = (Binding Response Units /kd) 80, 81 .",
