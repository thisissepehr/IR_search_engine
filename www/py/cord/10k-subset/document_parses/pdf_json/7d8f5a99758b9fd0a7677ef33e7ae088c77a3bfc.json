Clinically, PCV2 often causes disease through coinfection with other bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), and especially the highly prevalent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). The present study determined that continuous PCV2 infection in piglets down-regulates tight junction proteins (TJ) ZO-1 and occludin in the lungs. Swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) were used to explore the mechanisms and consequences of disruption of TJ, and an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model was established. Our results show that PCV2 infection in STEC decreases the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin and increases the permeability of the tracheal epithelial barrier, resulting in easier translocation of SS2. Moreover, Western blot analysis indicates that PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway. The disruption of TJ in SETC and increased permeability of the epithelial barrier induced by PCV2 could be alleviated by inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which indicates that the JNK/MAPK pathway regulates the expression of ZO-1 and occludin during PCV2 infection. This study allows us to better understand the mechanisms of PCV2 coinfection with bacterial pathogens and provides new insight into controlling the occurrence of PCVAD.",

It is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), a disease associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, reproductive disorders, enteric diseases and respiratory signs, which are responsible for great economic losses [1] . Horizontal transmission via the respiratory tract is one of the main routes of PCV2 infection [2] . Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is considered to be a commensal colonizer of the upper respiratory tract in swine, but it can also breach the epithelial barriers and cause infections, leading to arthritis, meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia and septicemia [3, 4] . A total of 35 serotypes have been reported based on capsular polysaccharide antigens, and serotype 2 (SS2) is frequently isolated from clinical diseased pigs [5] . In clinical studies, coinfections can often be determined among PCVAD cases [6] . The morbidity and mortality of PCVAD increases when PCV2 affected pig herds experience secondary infections or concurrent infections with other pathogens, such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [6, 7] . In recent years, PCV2 and S. suis coinfection cases have been frequently detected [8] ; however, there is poor understanding of whether/how PCV2 increases the risk of infection with S. suis.",

Both PCV2 and SS2 are pathogens that can cause disease through infection of the respiratory tract; thus, we hypothesized that PCV2 could promote SS2 translocation across the respiratory epithelial barrier. The respiratory epithelium is an important barrier to defend against foreign particles; dysfunction of the epithelial barrier is an important cause of pathogen invasions [10] . The integrity of the epithelial barrier is maintained by intercellular junctional complexes, including tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes [11, 12] . Tight junction proteins (TJ) are located at the apicolateral boundary of epithelial cells, and they significantly contribute to the barrier function of the epithelium [12] . However, the integrity of TJ could be disrupted during infection, resulting in the passage of microbial pathogens into subepithelial tissues [13] . The aim of the study is to investigate whether and how PCV2 infection disrupts TJ and contributes to SS2 translocation.",

The in vitro epithelial barrier models were infected with PCV2 at day 8. Compared with the control group, PCV2 infection significantly decreased the TEER at 36 h and 48 h after infection, and there was no differences at 24 h post-infection of PCV2 ( Figure 4B ). Measuring of the TEER has been widely accepted as a quantitative technique for monitoring epithelial barrier integrity [30] . Then, the numbers of SS2 penetrating across the epithelial barrier model were counted after 36 h and 48 h of PCV2 infection with SS2 infection times of 2 h. The number of translocated SS2 in the PCV2 infected group was greater than that in the control group ( Figure 4C ). Furthermore, compared to the SS2-infected alone, PCV2 and SS2 coinfection resulted in a greater TEER reduction ( Figure 4D ), indicating that coinfection increased the permeability of the epithelial barrier. Thus, we established an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model using STEC; PCV2 infection gradually reduced the TEER value and induced breakdown of the epithelial barrier integrity; PCV2 and SS2 coinfection induced increased-permeability and more SS2 translocation compared to SS2 infection alone.",

The results show that JNK was phosphorylated, indicating that JNK was activated in the process of PCV2 infection in STEC, while activation of p38 and ERK were not detected ( Figure 7A ). To determine the function of JNK on tight junction proteins, STEC were treated with inhibitor SP600125 to suppress the activation of JNK during the PCV2 infection period. The cell proteins were collected at 36 h and 48 h of PCV2 post-infection. Western blot analysis shows that inhibiting the activation of JNK would lessen the PCV2 induced reduction of ZO-1 and occludin protein levels to some degree ( Figure 7B ). Furthermore, we analyzed the epithelial barrier integrity by quantifying the amount of FITC-dextran crossing the Transwell chamber. Relative to the uninfected control, we found that the increased paracellular permeability caused by PCV2 infection were abrogated or partially abrogated by the JNK inhibitor ( Figure 7C ), providing further evidence that PCV2 induced disruption of the epithelial barrier occurs through the JNK/MAPK pathway. As shown in Figure 7D , the integrity of tight junction proteins is protected when treated with JNK inhibitor in PCV2 infected STEC. In summary, PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway; JNK phosphorylation plays an important role in disruption of TJ in STEC, and is related to the increased-permeability of the epithelial barrier caused by PCV2 infection.",

Significant differences in (B) and (C) were determined using one-way ANOVA analysis. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant. D Immunofluorescence staining of ZO-1 and occludin in STEC. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. The infection time of PCV2 was 48 h.",
