Most past research has examined how the effects of exposure to traumatic events influences whether someone meets diagnostic criteria for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); it has also suggested sequelae of disaster exposure depends on whether survivors are displaced from their homes. To capture the full range of the psychological impact of natural disasters, we examined the buffering effects of social support on depressive symptoms and cluster-specific PTSD symptoms, with consideration of displacement status. In a survey conducted 18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina, 810 adults exposed to the disaster reported the number of Katrina-related traumatic events experienced, perceived social support 2 months post-Katrina, and cluster-specific PTSD and depressive symptoms experienced since Katrina. Analyses assessed the moderating effects of social support and displacement and the conditional effects of displacement status. Social support significantly buffered the negative effect of Katrina-related traumatic events on depressive symptoms, B = \u22120.10, p = .001, and avoidance and arousal PTSD symptoms, B = \u22120.02, p = .035 and B = \u22120.02, p = .042, respectively. Three-way interactions were nonsignificant. Conditional effects indicated social support buffered development of depressive symptoms across all residents; however, the moderating effects of support on avoidance and arousal symptoms only appeared significant for nondisplaced residents.

McMillen, North, and Smith (2000) found that 48% of disaster survivors reported substantial reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive memories) and arousal symptoms (e.g., hypervigilance), but did not endorse avoidance symptoms and therefore failed to meet criteria for PTSD. Additionally, symptoms experienced for prolonged periods of time after a traumatic event could lead to the development of additional symptoms or worsening of current symptoms, thus placing an individual with subthreshold symptoms at risk for later full-threshold diagnostic status (Solomon, Horesh, & Ein-Dor, 2009 ). Given that subthreshold PTSD symptoms may fall within select symptom clusters and yield marked impairment, despite not meeting full diagnostic criteria (Stein, Walker, Hazen, & Forde, 1997) , it is important to understand whether the impact of disaster exposure and relevant psychosocial factors differs between symptom clusters.

One possible explanation is that social support may not directly affect the internal processes linked to the development and maintenance of reexperiencing symptoms (e.g., avoiding memories or thoughts about the event) in part because people willing to offer support may be less aware of the survivor's internal experiences, thus limiting their ability to offer support for those specific symptoms. Consistent with Joseph and colleagues' (1997) theory, social support may be more applicable to reducing avoidance symptoms because supporters could more easily facilitate increased engagement in activities and decreased isolation. Similarly, social support may buffer the development of arousal symptoms by encouraging or modeling emotion regulation skills. Further research is needed to better understand how specific mechanisms of social support impact the development of different PTSD symptom clusters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 791, "end": 820, "text": "Joseph and colleagues' (1997)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Results for the three-way interactions were nonsignificant when predicting all PTSD symptom clusters, which indicates that the buffering effect of social support was not statistically significantly different between displaced and nondisplaced residents when controlling for covariates and three additional interaction terms. However, exploratory analyses suggested some differences between groups when predicting arousal and avoidance symptoms, which may warrant additional research in the future, using larger sample sizes. Namely, exposure to traumatic events did not predict arousal and avoidance symptoms 18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina for nondisplaced individuals who endorsed medium-to-high levels of crisis-related social support, whereas there was no buffering effect for displaced residents. It should be noted that preliminary analyses indicated the two groups did not significantly differ in their mean levels of perceived social support. Because our assessment was limited to a brief self-report measure of social support, it is unclear why there were no differences between groups. Although there is a need for further research to better understand what factors may influence perceived support (e.g., types of support or idiosyncratic beliefs), similar levels across both groups suggests the role of social support on cluster-specific PTSD symptoms after a natural disaster could vary based on situational factors, specifically whether or not someone was displaced from his or her home. One possible explanation is that the type or quality of social support is different for displaced individuals, who may not have the same access to their typical social network and community (which might provide more meaningful support) as do nondisplaced individuals (i.e., differences in the helpfulness of their supporters), which may have been more likely to elicit buffering effects. This potential difference in the type of support may be especially important for reducing arousal symptoms if social support facilitates emotion regulation skills as previously described. Differences in avoidance symptoms could also be attributed to displaced individuals having greater opportunities to avoid external triggers, because they are not living in the same place where they experienced the disaster. Conversely, social support for nondisplaced residents may buffer the negative reinforcement of avoidance symptoms by encouraging individuals to engage with activities, people, and places in their community that remind them of the traumatic event. It follows that social support for displaced individuals might only have a direct effect on avoidance symptoms, consistent with previous studies (e.g., Pietrzak et al., 2010) , rather than impacting the specific association between Hurricane Katrina-related traumatic events and avoidance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2708, "end": 2730, "text": "Pietrzak et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Lastly, it should be noted that exploratory findings suggest the effects of crisis-related social support on cluster-specific PTSD symptoms may differ between displacement groups, whereas the significant buffering effects were consistent across both groups for depressive symptoms. These findings suggest the development of mental health outcomes could differ by displacement, and the role of social support may vary across mental health outcomes. In this study, discrepant results for cluster-specific PTSD symptoms of displaced residents could be attributed to the unique experience of other stressors after the hurricane (e.g., unsanitary living conditions, stress of receiving government or insurance payments), which may have explained a larger portion of variance in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms compared to depressive symptoms.

First, there was no baseline measurement of mental health symptoms or social support prior to the hurricane. This limitation is most relevant when considering the assessment of depressive symptoms, given that previous depressive and comorbid disorders could impact the experience of depressive symptoms following a traumatic event (Salcioglu, Basoglu, & Livanou, 2007) . Although it is possible that preexisting mental health concerns could have increased the likelihood of developing PTSD symptoms, it is unlikely the measurement of PTSD symptoms in this study captured symptoms related to previous traumatic exposure, because the assessment was directly linked to current hurricane experiences, consistent with previous studies (e.g., \"Did you deliberately try not to think or talk about Hurricane Katrina?\"; Tracy et al., 2011) . Also, there may have been differences in baseline social support or the availability of support within social networks, which could have influenced the amount of perceived support following the trauma itself.

Additionally, the CSS demonstrated lower reliability, which could have decreased the likelihood of detecting significant interaction effects. Second, the measures used to assess depressive and PTSD symptoms were brief and administered by trained interviewers, which may have led to over-or underestimation of symptoms. Also, brief measures that did not assess severity of each symptom may not have fully captured the level of impairment in participants who did not clearly meet full diagnostic criteria. However, it should be noted the data collected were a part of a larger epidemiological study with considerations of participant time and burden that prohibited the use of more detailed, clinician-rated assessments. Future studies would benefit from the assessment of PTSD symptom clusters and depressive symptoms in greater detail with consideration of the level of impairment associated with symptoms. Measurement of displacement status was also limited and did not include factors that could potentially influence distress associated with moving in the wake of a natural disaster. Future studies should incorporate a more detailed assessment of displacement factors such as voluntary or involuntary displacement, and immediate or delayed displacement.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Lastly, previous studies have suggested that large sample sizes (n > 500) and highly reliable measures (Cronbach's \u03b1s = .80 to 1.00) are needed to test three-way interactions with continuous moderators (Dawson & Richter, 2006) . Although there are limited guidelines for determining adequate sample sizes for a three-way interaction when including both continuous and dichotomous (i.e., displacement status) moderators, given the lower reliability of the CSS measure (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .73), this study may have been underpowered to detect such effects. Because three-way interactions were nonsignificant, tests of whether the moderating effects of social support on the association between trauma exposure and PTSD and depressive symptoms were conditional on participant membership in the nondisplaced group were exploratory and must be interpreted with caution. However, given the unique nature of this population and the difficulties associated with collecting longitudinal data from people who are both displaced and psychologically impacted by a natural disaster (e.g., Norris, 2006) , exploratory findings may still offer a significant contribution and highlight the need for additional research with larger sample sizes and highly reliable measures to better understand how displacement status and social support influence the development of mental health outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 202, "end": 226, "text": "(Dawson & Richter, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1085, "text": "Norris, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Despite limitations, the present study identified the unique impact of social support in both displaced and nondisplaced Mississippi residents following Hurricane Katrina, beyond the effects of previous traumatic experiences and post-Hurricane Katrina stressors.
