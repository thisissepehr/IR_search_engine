Even with currently available ventilatory support it re-tains a significant morbidity and mortality with one subgroup, those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), having a mortality rate of 40-75 % [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, it has also been suggested that much lower mortalities (< 10%) may occur in specific conditions such as respiratory syncytial virus-related ARDS [7] . In this setting, promising new interventions, including permissive hypercarbia, exogenous surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and perfluorocarbon-assisted gas exchange have been described with the purpose of 'rescuing' potential survivors from severe pathology. In order to evaluate effectively such therapies, clinical trials have adopted assessments of disease severity for patient recruitment. Such an approach is based on the hypothesis that the initial magnitude of acute severe physiological derangement equates with subsequent mortality. Thereby warranting the experimental intervention as well as providing a measure for verifying the similarity between treatment patients and control patients.",

Rather, in common with Sarnaik and colleagues [9] , who found in their pediatric study that response to an intervention better predicted intensive care outcome, we reported that greater improvement in oxygenation to an intervention (a standard dose of inhaled nitric oxide) was associated with improved outcome [8] . This suggests that with current clinical expertise, a test of potential ventilation-perfusion mismatch, shunt and lung injury reversibility is a more appropriate predictor of outcome than the status prior to any intervention. In an individual patient, such a response to intervention should be indicated by their best, rather than worst, measure of gas exchange, Therefore, the purpose of the present prospective, single institution study of AHRF in children was to assess whether the best, early respiratory indices in non-survivors were significantly different from those who survived.",

Between August 1 1995 and March 31 1997, all children older than 1 month and less than 16 years of age admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) were eligible for inclusion in this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were modified from the American-European Consensus Conference diagnostic criteria for ARDS [10] : a) acute onset of respiratory failure over less than 48 h, b) evidence of a severe defect in oxygenation (arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FIO2) of less than 200 mmHg) for at least six consecutive hours on the day of PICU admission, c) no evidence of left atrial hypertension and d) four quadrant interstitial shadowing on chest X-ray. Children without the characteristic chest X-ray appearances of ARDS, but meeting the other criteria for ARDS, were described as cases of AHRE Details of the patients' acute diagnoses as well as any underlying conditions were recorded. An electronic patient charting sys-tem (CareVue, Hewlett Packard) was reviewed daily and ventilator and physiological parameters recorded and stored on a separate data base. Every blood gas analysis performed throughout the patients' admissions was reviewed and the oxygenation index (OI = mean airway pressure (MAP) x FIO2/PaO2) , alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2), PaO2/FIO 2 ratio and ventilation index (VI = respiratory rate x PaCO 2 x peak inspiratory pressure / 1000) were calculated for each blood gas measurement. Analyses carried out used the best value obtained over the period under assessment. For the comparison with previously reported studies [2] [3] [4] [5] every blood gas was reviewed and the respective study criteria applied for patient selection.",

High frequency oscillatory ventilation was employed if oxygenation was inadequate with a MAP of 20 cmH20 or greater. The use of inhaled nitric oxide therapy throughout the last 12 months of the study was controlled by an institution approved multi-center randomisation protocol. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was employed when no stability could be achieved with the above techniques. Death or survival to discharge from the PICU were the end points of the study. In children who died, the mode of death was recorded: failed resuscitation, limitation or withdrawal of support or brain death. The clinical course of patients with AHRF was categorised according to the severity of disrupted gas exchange and whether or not improvement occurred within 3 days.",

One patient with AHRF died within 6 h of admission, having been inappropriately intubated and resuscitated: since treatment was limited from the time of admission, his respiratory indices data were excluded from analysis. Fifty-two children who fulfilled the full criteria for ARDS in addition to AHRF had a significantly higher mortality in comparison to the non-ARDS, AHRF patients: 36.5% (19/52) and 10.6% (7/66), respectively (p < 0.001). The ventilatory strategy in these patients is reflected in the group median PaCO2 and MAP for survivors and non-survivors for each day of the study (Fig. 1 ).

Survivors follow one of three clinical patterns: a course of mild disease only (pattern A: n--45), early improvement within 3 days (pattern B: n = 23) or later improvement longer than 3 days (pattern C: n --24). Non-survivors die with persistent, severe, hypoxemic, respiratory failure (pattern D: n --17) or during or following resolution of AHRF (pattern E: n --9). The majority of deaths occur in children with persistently severe abnormal gas exchange (pattern D). Of these children, none were previously healthy (ten were immunodeficient, three were ex-premature infants and the others had inherited metabolic disorders or major chromosomal abnormalities). Further, only six of these patients died whilst receiving full supportive treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the remainder had either support withdrawn (4/17) or a limitation of intensive care therapy (7/17) because of the severity of the associated conditions or co-incident organ failure. Therefore only six cases with AHRF reached a point of unsupportable respiratory failure, and none of these were previously normal children. The other children who died (pattern E) most frequently did so from severe cerebral injury (5/9 from brain death including the three previously normal children who died) with the other four cases having supportive treatment withdrawn or limited because of the severity of associated diseases.",

Further, when using a defined ventilatory strategy, which in our practice emphasises permissive hypercarbia and lung volume recruitment, severity of ventilatory parameters (i. e., high MAP) rather than indices of gas exchange, reflected better the likelihood of poor outcome. Most importantly, where the acute physiological parameters fail to differ between good and poor outcome patients, we propose that the presence of severe pre-existing disease or associated pathology, rather than severity of respiratory failure alone is associated with outcome in modern pediatric practice.

            "text": "The patients in our series exhibited one of five patterns in their clinical course. Deaths amongst children admitted in AHRF can occur with active and progressive lung disease (pattern D) or in spite of resolving lung disease (pattern E). In children who survive, recovery may be slow or fairly rapid. On inspecting the data, it is apparent that there are similarities in the initial respiratory indices in children who survive despite severe, prolonged gas exchange disruption (pattern C) and those who die despite improving or improved gas exchange parameters (pattern E). The relative proportion of the patients with these patterns in a population being studied will clearly determine the utility of gas exchange parameters in predicting survival: conversely, as is our experience when including patients with underlying immunodeficiency or other associated diseases, these proportions may confound their use. Of further note is the mode of death in children with persistently, severely abnormal gas exchange (pattern D): cases rarely reached a level of respiratory failure which was unsupportable by current techniques. Instead, in the majority of cases (11/17) treatment was discontinued or limited as a result of other aspects of the clinical situation. Worth re-emphasising in this context is the observation that no previously normal child died of unsupportable respiratory failure. Observations from adult intensive care studies of lung injury have indicated that outcome is not necessarily related to the level of arterial oxygenation [12, 13] . In contrast, many previous pediatric studies in defined populations have supported a contrary notion [1, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In the present pediatric study, we have observed that mortality from respiratory failure appears to be related to associated disease rather than the severity of initial gas exchange per se. The implications of such a hypothesis are wide. Firstly, is there much to be gained by refining further the techniques of respiratory support when mortality is frequently determined by non-pulmonary factors? Indeed, it has been suggested that mechanical ventilation should now be considered less a form of treatment than a form of organ support during disease resolution [14] .",

Perhaps the reported value of such pulmonary physiological predictors, with their institution specificity, are more a reflection of physician behavior, i. e. patient selection and local ventilatory strategy employed, than patient pulmonary pathophysiology. In this context, it is of interest that we found the presence or absence of AHRF in all PICU patients to be a discriminator. More recently developed non-linear, multiple logistic regression models that predict the risk of death for children less than 16 years of age (e. g., the 'Pediatric Risk of Mortality III'-PRISM IfI [15] and the 'Paediatric Index of Mortality' -PIM [16] ) may improve the outcome prediction since they incorporate both diagnostic and disease categories as well as acute physiological respiratory parameters. However, these two severity scoring systems do differ: not least in their ability, possibly, to be influenced by the ventilatory strategy employed. PRISM III utilizes pH, PCO2, POz and FIO2 and respiratory rate, whereas PIM utilizes PO2 and FIO2, and whether or not mechanical ventilation is being used.",

It is possible that a comparison between heterogeneous treated and control groups using only early respiratory parameters to confirm similarity of disease severity is invalid. In keeping with other reports [17] , the present series indicates that case mix should not be ignored, e.g., AHRF in an ex-premature infant with respiratory syncytial virus is not the same as AHRF in an infant with aspiration pneumonia -even if the respiratory indices suggest they are similar. Therefore, is it not time to reconsider disease-specific stratification criteria in any future treatment evaluation, even though this will inevitably mean that studies will take much longer to recruit sufficient patients. Finally, since death in a previously normal child is now an infrequent end point in AHRF, our data reiterates a previously discussed idea [18] , that other markers sought.",
