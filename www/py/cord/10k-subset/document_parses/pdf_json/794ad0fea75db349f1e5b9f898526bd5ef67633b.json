It was originally mainly used as volume replacement, mostly during World War II and the Korean War. Over the years, its indication has shifted to correct coagulation factors deficiencies or to prevent bleeding. Currently, it remains a frequent treatment in the intensive care unit, both for critically ill adults and children. However, observational studies have shown that plasma transfusion fail to correct mildly abnormal coagulation tests. Furthermore, recent epidemiological studies have shown that plasma transfusions are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Therefore, plasma, as any other treatment, has to be used when the benefits outweigh the risks. Based on observational data, most experts suggest limiting its use either to massively bleeding patients or bleeding patients who have documented abnormal coagulation tests, and refraining for transfusing plasma to nonbleeding patients whatever their coagulation tests.

These levels are deemed adequate for haemostasis. Pooled fresh-frozen plasma: As there is a high variability in coagulation factors between single donor units of FFP [3] , pooling plasma from many donors (of identical ABO blood group) provides a method to maintain a constant concentration of these factors. However, pooling donors increases the risks of transmission of infectious diseases. To reduce this risk, multiple pathogen inactivation methods are used, such as solvent/detergent (SD) treatment, methylene blue (MB), ultraviolet light with riboflavin, and psoralens (amotosalen). SD-FFP inactivates enveloped virus but has no effect on hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. SD-FFP also seems to reduce HLA concentrations and bioactive lipids, which could lead to fewer immunologic adverse effects [8] . MB-FFP has low factor VIII (FVIIII) and fibrinogen activity, whereas SD-FFP has reduced activity of VWF et FVIII as well as lower functional activity of protein S. Therefore, SD-FFP should not be used in patients with IgA or severe protein S deficiency. However, although FFP and SD-FFP differ in several aspects [9] , they are considered to be interchangeable in most European countries. Thawed plasma: FFP or FP thawed at 37\u00b0C (if thawed at 4\u00b0C, cryoprecipitate will form) and then stored for up to 5 days at 1 to 6\u00b0C [10] . The advantage of thawed plasma is its availability for immediate use. It therefore can be used rapidly, for example in massively bleeding patients. Nevertheless, it should not be used if either factor V or factor VIII is specifically needed because of the decline of their activity [1] . Furthermore, its usefulness and safety has not been demonstrated yet in neonates and infants. Cryoprecipitate: Cryoprecipitate is prepared by thawing frozen plasma at 1\u00b0C to 6\u00b0C, which causes some proteins to precipitate. This cryoprecipitate is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, factor XIII, and von Willebrand factor (vWF). It is then refrozen at \u221218\u00b0C and can be stored up to 1 year.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 58, "end": 61, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 62, "end": 64, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 233, "end": 236, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 872, "end": 875, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1194, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1402, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1690, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "What is the effect of plasma transfusions on coagulation test results?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What are the clinical effects of plasma?"}, {"text": "As plasma contains coagulation factors [3] , its most frequent indication is to correct abnormal coagulation tests [1] .
