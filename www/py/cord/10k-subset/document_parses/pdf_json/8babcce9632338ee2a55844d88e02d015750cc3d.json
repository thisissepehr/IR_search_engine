METHOD: Ig-deficient mouse embryos in a conventional environment were embryotransferred to specified pathogen free (SPF) dams. Neonatal growth, mortality, and health status of mice from both environments was recorded. Suspected presence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was tested by RT-PCR. Protective effects on neonatal mortality of milk containing different titers of anti-MHV antibodies were investigated in cross-fostering experiments. RESULTS: The SPF colony of Ig-deficient mice exhibited no breeding problems, whereas Ig-deficient neonates in the conventional environment suffered from lethal wasting syndrome. Serological screening of the mice kept in the two environments revealed that mice in the conventional room had high titers of antibodies against mouse hepatitis virus. Presence of MHV in runting neonates was confirmed by pathological examinations and RT-nested-PCR using MHV genome specific primers. Milk containing high titers of anti-MHV antibodies, when provided for 8 days or more, completely prevented Ig-deficient neonates from developing wasting syndrome in the conventional environment. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the neonatal wasting syndrome is associated with the presence of MHV and that neonates are efficiently protected by MHV-specific antibodies in the milk.",

Despite this, most neonates survive the postpartum period even though they are exposed to a variety of environmental pathogens. It has been suggested that during the first weeks of life, neonates are protected against a wide spectrum of pathogens by maternally derived passive immunity.'.' During midgestation pregnant mice begin to prepare for transmission of passive immunity to their fetuses by increasing the number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells.\" It is also clear that pregnancy proceeds without any complications in the absence of maternal immunoglobulin ~ecretion.~\" However, in a conventional animal house environment, it appears as if postnatal transmission of maternal immunoglobulins is almost essential for neonatal survival. This stems from the observation that normal and Ig-deficient neonatal mice nursed by Ig-deficient dams normally suffer from growth retardation and high mortality (wasting syndrome) if kept under conventional conditions.* However, if Ig-deficient neonates are nursed by immune dams, which provide them with passive immunity, neonatal development will be normal.* We also observed that highly purified monoclonal anti-collagen I1 IgG antibodies positively affected the resistance to runting.' These antibodies would be expected to have little relevance for protection against environmental pathogens.",

The pups nursed by P2microglobulin-deficient dams, which produce low anti-MHV titers, were not completely protected from infection, and by day 20 postpartum, mortality was 40%. Pups nursed by an immunocompetent C57BL/6J dam were completely free of any signs of acute infection.

By using embryo transfer methods, we studied Ig-deficient neonatal mouse development in the two environments. The Ig-deficient neonates nursed by Ig-deficient dams showed growth retardation and had a very high mortality in the conventional room, whereas pups nursed in the SPF environment were successfully raised during homozygous breeding. These results suggests that the wasting syndrome is caused by pathogens in the conventional room. Results from the health monitoring revealed pathogenic differences between mice kept in the two environments. Proteus mirabilis is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen that can remain latent in the intestinal tracts of and was present in mice from both environments. Mice in the conventional room had high titers of anti-MHV antibodies and were positive for Escherichia coli and Aspicularis tetraptera. Escherichia coli is not a major pathogen of micez3 and Aspicularis tetraptera is a common mouse parasite and infection is usually a~ymptomatic.'~ These results indicate that particularly MHV could be involved in the lethal wasting syndrome of neonates nursed by Ig-deficient dams in the conventional room. An influence of other unidentified pathogens could not be excluded. It can also be assumed that lg-deficient mice might have problems to completely eliminate this virus, since the mortality patterns of Ig-deficient mice kept under conventional conditions differ somewhat from time to time. but accumulated data from longer time periods often are amazingly similar. However, no persistent MHV infections have yet been described. It is also known that MHV causes a wasting syndrome in other immunodeficient mice, such as athymic (nu/nu) and SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) Intrauterine transmission of MHV may occur in infections of susceptible pregnant mice with polytropic MHV strains that are sufficiently virulent to induce disseminated infection in adult mice.26 However, infection at this stage results in abortion and the likelihood of fetuses born with active MHV infection is remote.26 In this study, the embryo transfer performed did eliminate the MHV infection, and if other pathogens were involved in the induction of the wasting syndrome it could be concluded that these hypothetical pathogens also were eliminated by the embryo transfer procedure.",

For instance, there appears to be a correlation between maternal titer of anti-MHV antibodies and protective effect on suckling neonates. C57BL/6J immune dams with high titers of anti-MHV antibodies provided complete protection if neonates were provided with milk for 8 days or longer. P2microglobulin-deficient mice, which lack surface expression of MHC class I expression as well as CD8 positive T cells, produced MHV antibodies of low C2 MUNKSGAARD. COPENHAGEN titer, and their milk provided marginal protection. The MHC class II-deficient mice which showed normal levels of immunoglobulins, but are unable to respond to T cell dependent antigens, lacked anti-MHV antibodies, and could not be expected to provide relevant passive immunity to any T cell dependent antigen. Despite this, their milk provided a low, but significant protection of Ig-deficient neonates. These results strengthen our previous observation that irrelevant immunoglobulins exert a weak low, but significant, health promoting effect on neonates raised under pathogenic pressure. These experiments also showed that the susceptibility of neonatal mice to MHV infection is unrelated to the lack of endogenous immunoglobulins and that only the immune status of the dam nursing the pups was relevant for the pups' survival,",
