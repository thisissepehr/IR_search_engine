Differences between typical and atypical manifestations are presented. Several features in radiological evolution are noted. Methods: Radiological evolution of 25 patients with PCP was studied and plain PA and l films were reviewed. Films were taken at different moments during the disease: a) before admittance, b) at admittance, c) before treatment, d) during treatment, and e) after clinical improvement. Results: Interstitial reticular or reticulo-nodular infiltrates are the most frequent pattern found in our study. There is a wide variety of other patterns, known as atypical, which, although less frequent, may appear during this disease. Several films of typical and atypical cases are shown, including atypical features like lobar consolidation, cavitation, apical infiltrates mimicking TBC, pneumatoceles, pleural effusion, a,s.o. Conclusions: Recognizing the different patterns of chest involvement is of great importance in suggesting diagnosis of PCP, as well as in differentiating this entity from other infectious or non-infectious diseases in AI DS-patients.",

Methods and Materials: 22 isolated lungs were fixed with a solution containing polyethylene glycol 400 and dried by air inflation applying a constant pressure of 25 mm Hg. HRCT scans were obtained in standard positions and gross pathological sections were prepared at exactly identical levels. A matrix was projected to CT scans and pathological sections to allow precise correlation between CT. macro-and microscopic findings. Results: The method applied, particularly with the matrix technique. allowed an exact regional HRCT-pathologic correlation. The patients studied included: ARDS, n = 4, pneumonia. n = 3. tuberculosis, n = 2. mUltiple lung abscesses, n = I, CO PD. n = I, pulmonary embolic infarction. n = I. intoxication, n = I, Goodpasture's syndrome. n = I. pulmonary metastasis. n -4. pulmonary lymphoma, n -2. We observed, that even with well established CT-phenomena complex differential diagnoses often had to be considered. Conclusions: Postmortem pathologic correlation of pulmonary HRCT applying the matrix technique allows precise characterization of radiologic findings. We therefore conclude that through these observations an optimization of in vivo pulmonary CT imaging can be obtained.",

We tried to evaluate its utility in diagnosis of seldom described metastases to adrenal glands and pancreas. Material of the work consists of 800 patients with histologically recognised lung cancer in whom 2150 ultrasonic examinations were performed. Intraabdominal metastases were found in 147 cases (18,4%) being encountered most frequently in the liver (84). adrenals (66) and abdominal lymph nodes. CT was performed to confirm US study results. The size of demonstrated adrenal tumors varied form 7-10 mm when located in the right gland and 10-14 mm in the left gland to several centimeters. Metastases were found in 37 out of 175 patients with small cell carcinoma (21 %). 14/143 cases of adenocarcinoma (10%). 7/305 cases of carcinoma planoepitheliale (2,4%) and 8/177 of other lung neoplasms. Out of 12 patients with metastases to pancreas 10 were affected with small cell carcinoma. Ultrasonic images of all smaller changes (under 2 cm diameter) presented hypoechoic, homogeneous well defined foci localized within pancreatic tissue. bigger metastases appeared as hypoechoic lesions with uneven echogenicity that were not affecting pancreatic duct diameter. CT proved to be superior in diagnosis of adrenal metastases (specially when localized on the left side) while US was better in pancreatic changes (CT failed to visualize 4 out of 12 tumors). Follow up studies of patients with small cell ca and adrenal metastases showed to be an useful indicator of chemotherapy effects.

It is discovered commonly as an incidental finding in young adults. In the past, the diagnosis was made surgically. Nowadays the condition is characterized by nearly pathognomonic radiologic features wich have significant implications in the patient management. The plain film and CT findings consists in a lobar hyperinsunation associated with bronchomucocele. Endoscopic examination is necessary for excluding other causes of mucoid impactation. If the diagnosis is supported by both radiological and endoscopic methods, conservative treatment is recommended.

Vicente de Vera; Barcelona Macleod (or Swyer-James) syndrome is often diagnosed with plain chest radiographs. Other radiological procedures are also very useful to confirm the suspected diagnosis. Features of distinct radiological procedures such as scintigraphy of the lung, angiography, bronchography and C.T in 7 patients with Macleod syndrome are presented and evaluated comparatively. Plain chest radiography shows a hyperlucent lung of reduced or normal size with diminished vascular markings and little change in lung volume during respiration. Pulmonary scintigraphy shows markedly decreased perfusion in the affected lung. The perfusion image alone does not exclude other vascular abnormalities. Ventilation-perfusion imaging is helpful in confirming the presence of this syndrome. C.T findings are: I. reduction of attenuation values of the affected lung 2. loss of normal anteroposterior gradient attenuation 3. diminishing of central and peripheric pulmonary arteries. Other associated findings, in C.T, include parenchymal changes such as bronchiectasis. Conventional or digital pulmonary angiography demonstrates the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to be smaller than normal with thin branches and diminished vascularity in capillary and venous phases.",

Palmer; Barcelona Purpose: To demonstrate that a dense azygos lobe that looks abnormal on the PA chest radiograph may be a normal variant. Methods and Materials: Eight patients with a dense azygos lobe on PA chest radiographs were studied with CT. Slices were 8 mm thick. with a 10 mm interval. Results: None of the patients had any pathologic process of the lung or mediastinum. All of them had a shallow azygos lobe and increased depth of the mediastinal soft tissues in front of it. We measured the depth of the mediastinal soft tissues and of the lung within the azygos lobe at the level of the sternoclavicular joint. The ratio soft tissue/lung was greater than one in all our patients, whereas it was less than one in ten other patients with normalappearing azygos lobes. The cause of the increased depth of the mediastinum was marked elongation of the great vessels in seven cases and tumor infiltration of the right chest wall in one. Conclusions: We conclude that the increased density is due to the combination of a shallow azygos lobe and increased depth of the mediastinum, caused in the majority of cases by elongated vessels. Characteristically. free pleural fluid has a lenticular shape and uniform density on CT studies. In the last two years we have seen several cases of pleural effusion that show atypical features. either in shape or in density. In some cases. free pleural fluid adopts a convex shape simulating encapsulation. In other cases, the fluid had a nodular appearance, mimicking pleural masses. In one case. fluid in an azygos lobe simulated a mediastinal mass. In all cases. the diagnosis was easily made with prone CT, that showed that the fluid moved freely within the pleural space. Increased density of the fluid may be secondary to bleeding. Localized dense areas suggest metastatic implants or primary tumors. Occasionally a dark transverse band within the fluid is seen, representing displaced extrapleural fat.",

Application of ultrasound to the guidance of aspiration biopsy of the peripheral pulmonary lesions currently become the method of first choice because of its simplicity and low rate of complications. We report our experience in ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsy in 40 patients who had peripheral pulmonary masses. The mass was analyzed with respect to the size. margin and internal sonographic pattern. Distances from the skin to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the mass were measured. We used a 22 gauge Chiba needle for the aspiration biopsy. Ultrasonically guided percutaneous needle biopsy of pulmonary masses in contact with the chest wall is a safe simple procedure. The lack of ionising radiation, the relatively low cost and wide availability, the ability to visualise the anterior and posterior wall of the mass and the ni:edle tip, which provides continuous guidance during the biopsy are advantages of ultrasound when compared with fluoroscopy and computerised tomography guided biopsy. Methods and Materials: PET studies were obtained using a whole-body PET scanner with F-18-labelled deoxyglucose (FOG) . Dynamic studies as well as endpoint measurements 15 post injection of 440 Mbq FOG iv. were obtained. Emission scans of 15 minutes and transmission scans of 5 minutes were obtained 50 minutes post injection. Tracer uptake concentrations lire quantified using the standardised uptake value. More than 150 PET studies of thoracic lesions have been performed. Results: All malignant untreated tumors showed significant FOG uptake with uptake values above 1.8 SUY. All benign lesions showed significant lower FOG accumulation with some overlap for patients with tuberculosis. PET shows a great potential in the preoperative evaluation of indetermined lesions with a high sensitivity and specificity for T-as well as N-staging. PET also shows tremendous potential in the evaluation of therapy response by correctly predicting the therapy success prior to midpoint of the protocol.",

All 203 cases were scanned sequentially from lung apex to base in inspiratory apnea, using contiguous 10 mm sections. Sections were partially obtained with collimation of 5 mm in 13 cases and 2 mm in twelve. Scanning was performed by tilting the gantry cephaladly to about 20 degrees with 5 mm collimation in 2 cases and 2 mm in 5 cases. Studies were performed with a TCT 60A or 70A (TOSHIBA; TOKYO). The present CP..::: in which pleural fissures were recognized not as the hypovascular zone but as the opaque density are discussed. By conventional scanning with 10 mm collimation, a bilateral major fissure was recognized in 36 cases and unilateral major fissure in 43 cases. Sixty-six cases showed linear or bandlike density of the major fissure. In 38 cases, the major fissure was demonstrated by the difference in pulmonary density between the upper and lower lobes. By thin scanning with 5 mm and 2 mm collimation, all cases showed linear density of the major fissure. It was quite difficult to detect minor fissure as opaque densitiy in conventional scanning, but 5 of 13 cases with 5 mm collimation and 10 of 12 cases with 2 mm collimation showed an opaque line. In 7 cases of thin scanning by tilting the gantry cephaladly, pleural fissures could be seen more clearly than in other cases of axial thin scanning. Thin scanning is thus shown useful of detecting pleural fissures and improving detectability not only of the major fissure but ofthe minor fissure as well by thin scanning tilting the gantry cephaladly within the possible range.",

There was evidence of distortion of secondary lobules eithout thickening of the intralobular interstitium. Thickening of interlobar fissure were frequently identified and subpleural line as well, typically described in Asbestosis and Pulmonary Fibrosis.

This study were undertaken to establish radiographic and CT features of CEP based on pathologic study. Methods and Materials: Open lung biopsy with informed concent was performed on 6 cases clinically diagnosed eosinophilic pneumonia which could not be confirmed by TBLB or which were difficult to distinguish from BOOP. Results: All the cases had eosinophilia in peripheral blood (9-75%) and BAL fluid (3-43%) . Chest radiographs and CT showed multiple alveolar shadows in the peripheral lung field (4 cases), both alveolar and interstitial shadows (I case) and only interstitial shadow (I case). Pathologically these radiologic abnormalities corresponded to infiltrate of eosinophils and other cell in the aveolar space and interstitial tissue of the lung (alveolar wall, inter lobular septum, peribronchiolar and vascular space and pleura), respectively. In 2 cases, typical organizing materials were found in both alveolar space and bronchiolar lumen, which was also responsible for airspace shadows. Conclusions: The most important pathologic features of CEP were a wide aspect of interstitial involvement of the lung in addition to airspace consolidation, while in BOOP interstitial involvement was confined to the alveolar septum.",

Methods and Materials: This system used digital image-processing techniques based on the information which were extracted from 266 chest radiograms (192 with a cancerous nodule and 74 normals). This system can a) detect nodules using a previously developed called as Directional Contrast Filter for Nodules which is effective for detecting nodules with obscure margins, b) eliminate false positive foci and c) classify radiograms by existing nodules. An experiment using 108 practical radiograms (30 with nodules and 78 normals) was performed. Each nodule on a chest radiogram is pathologically proven to be primary pulmonary carcinomas and less than 30 mm in diameter. Results: As a result, figures of76. 7% for sensitivity and 69.2% for for specificity of the system were obtained.

Methods: We present 8 male patients aged between 40 and 60 years with bronchoscopic diagnosis of centra bronchial epidermoid carcinoma. Posteroanterior and lateral thoracic radiography, CT with and without intravenous contrast, dynamic CT and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance were all performed in each patient. Arteriography was carried out in five. We compared our data with the surgical findings. We considered as criteria of invasion a contact angle greater than 90\u00b0, absence of fat-plane between tumour and vessel wall, and either concentric or non-concentric irregularity of the vessel lumen. Results: The most useful criteria of invasion was the irregularity of the lumen in both pulmonary and aortic invasion, being present in 100% of the surgical positive cases. Of the imaging techniques, NMR in axial slices for the pulmonary artery and axial and coronal slices for the aorta, were the most useful in the diagnosis of the irregularity and its extension, surpassing the arteriography in cases where invasion is excentric or there is adventicia I and perivascular affectation. Purpose: We show our experience in the radiological findings of bacterial pneumonias in HIV positive patients, findings about which little has been published because this pathology is less frequent than others typical opportunistic infections. Methods: We present a series of 13 male patients, all of them intravenous drug abusers in whom different causative agents were isolated, and two of them presented two concomitant germ ens. 2 died because the pulmonary infection and the remainder recovered completely.

Results: We found inferior lobes affected in 8 patients (mostly right and either diffuse or multiple alveolar infiltrates in 5 cases, cavitary lesions were present in 7 cases as an actual parenquimal destruction. Associated pleural effusion was observed in 6 cases. Radiological evolution to normal was found in 10 cases, included those with pulmonary parenchymal destruction, after a prolongate course.

Purpose: To study the feasibility of MRI for morphologic localization of arrhythmogenic tissue as defined functionally by magnetocardiographic and invasive electrophysiologic techniques a 3-dimensional orthogonal grid was developed, whose extrathoracic markers could be detected in the MRI (CUS04), Cine-Angiographie (lead) and the magnetocardiogram (inductioncoil) and were arranged within a 5 mm diameter capsule. Methods and Materials: In 12 patients with overt Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrome and preexcitation ofthe right (2) or left free wall (7) or the posterior septum (3) , the MRI of the heart (ECG-triggered Spinechosequence, TE = 12, TR = RR) was performed. The functional localization of ventricular preexcitation was defined by MCG (magnetic shielding. 37-channel SQUID-Magnetometer) and electrode catheter position at the side of the accessory pathway (Cine-film). All localization results were related to the constant grid position. Results: EP and MCG localization were comparable with a deviation of I cm. Both were projected at the A V groove in patients with free wall accessory pathway (AP) or at the os of the coronary sinus in patients with preexcitation syndrome (PS). Conclusions: Using a multifunctional precardial grid as a reference, cardiac MRI provides exact morphologic information on arrhythmogenic tissue, which is important for interventional electrophysiology (catheter ablation or antitachycardiac surgery). We performed a clinical evaluation of strecker stent. Twenty-one patients (23 extremities) with arteriosclerotic stenoses and occlusions of the iliac and femoro-popliteal arteries were treated with 30 stents measuring 4-8 mm in diameter. Indications were poor results with percutaneous transluminal angiopathy (PTA) in all cases. In two patients with femoro-popliteallesions the indication was a limb at risk for amputation.

Carlier; Lens But: Since the angioscopy specifies the pathological nature of the arteriopathy, it enables some intravascular procedures. Its development could give way to the \"ENDOLUMINAL SURGERY\". Methods and results: Since 1987, the authors have systematically associated the angioscopy with 290 cases of lower limbs arteries angioplasties, including 42 cases of endoluminal procedures. After instruments presentation, the results are described: -aspiration of three fresh clots unbedded in stenosis previous balloon angioplasty, preventing distal migration; -one altered clot extraction with dormia cage; -angioscopy monitoring of four severe stenoses, preventing laceration due to over inflation; six balloon catheters correctly driven into the true channel preventing false channel laceration; -four recanalisations by thermo-laser; -10 stents insertion under angioscopy control. Later endoscopy demonstrates the evolution is different according to the type and location of the stent; -successfully extraction of 6 atheromas. One example of every technique is displayed on video tape. Conclusions: Percutaneous angioscopy looks useful if not necessary previous angioplasty: WATCHING FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING. It extends recanalisation indications to iliac arteries occlusions (12% of iliac arteritis); femoral arteries procedures are carried out more safely and \";1 la carte\" according to the pathologic lesion: \"UNDERSTANDING FOR BETTER TECHNIQUE\".

Savastano, D. Miotto, A. Torraco, L. Castellan; Padova Purpose: To evaluate the histology of retrieved material, obtained during arterial recanalization with the Transluminal Extraction Catheter (TEe). Methods: 35 lesions (12 stenoses and 23 occlusions) were recanalized with the TEC in 27 patients. At the end of the procedure pathologic analysis was performed on the excised material in 20 cases; both usual and particular stains were used. Results: Histological examination revealed a whole plaque in one case; in all the others the retrieved material appeared disrupted and grinded. Fibrotic components were evident in all cases (20120), while atheromatous material was demonstrated in 5 cases. Thrombus, both fresh and organizing, was present in almost all specimens (19120): calcium components were found in 6 cases; in 7 cases elastic fibers from tunica media were present. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that the atherosclerotic plaque grows mainly by deposition and thrombosis, with subsequent fibrotic organization. Recent mural thrombosis is frequently found in complete occlusions (80%) also in patients with history of chronic disease, attesting the effectiveness of TEC in recanalizing such long lesions. The presence of fibrotic material, atheromatous components and calcium indicates the capability to remove also material often resistant to conventional PTA. The absence of adventitia confirms the sure intraluminal action of the instrument.",

In eight aortas, stents were delivered after balloon catheter-induced denudation of intima and in four out of the eight aortas, stents were also placed into the normal sites to compare neointimal thickness of the normal and denuded sites. Angiography, light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic examinations were performed lifter I week (n = I), 2 weeks (n = 6), 3 weeks (n = 5) and 6 weeks (n = 2). The patency rate and thrombosis rate were 100% and 35% in aortas and 100% and 60% in inferior venae cavae. The aortic stent wires were covered with thin fibrinous membrane, blood cells and scanty myointimal cells after I week. Nearly complete transparent neointimal covering was found in aortas and caval veins after 2 weeks. There was no significant difference in intimal thickness betweell the denuded and normal aortas after 2 weeks (p = 0.51) and 3 weeks (p = 0.56). In four dogs with caval vein stents, there were evidences of hemorrhagic infarction in lungs. The thrombosis rate of 12 stents with stent-artery ratio (SAR) 1.5 or higher was 41 %, while there was no thrombus on the four stents with SAR 1.2 or lower except one specimen after I week. The high SAR of aortic stents may be a cause of thrombosis due to prolonged damage to intima and media. It is suggested that stents with SAR 1.2 or lower are more suitable. The high thrombosis rate of inferior venae cavae may be related with slow blood flow.",

We met two patients with duplication of the inferior vena cava, two with transposition of the vessel, and one with retroaortic left renal vein. In four cases the diagnosis was confirmed through demonstration of venous flow within the imaged anomalous vascular structures using duplex Doppler equipment. The diagnostic capabilities of sonographic imaging and Doppler analysis of blood flow allow a non-invasive diagnosis of these vascular anomalies. In our opinion, contrast studies are needed only when retroperitoneal structures are difficult to evaluate by ultrasound due to obesity and/or overlying abundant intesti nal gas. Introduction: The purpose of our study is to test the variability and reproducibility of left ventricular volumes and functional parameters using Cine-MR. The introduction of Cine-MR as a routine procedure will be discussed. Methods: 16 volunteers were evaluated by MRT using a 1.5 Tesla equipment. The left ventricle was shown in different planes. We used a gradientecho-sequence (TE -12 ms; FL = 60; TR = RR). The calculation procedures (monoplane, biplane, 3-dimensional, reconstruction by adding the areas of each slice) were tested for their concordant results, The images were evaluated by two independant observers. The reproducibility was tested by follow-up examinations. Results: The 3-dimensional reconstruction of the left ventricle as well as the biplane calculation procedure showed a very low standard deviation (SD) of the means (stroke volume: SD< 16ml; ejection fraction: SD<2%). The standard deviation of the monoplane calculations were higher (SV: SD 20 ml; EF: SD 5%). Control examinations showed well reproducible (r> 0.75, p < 0.001). A low interobserver variability was observed (%variability < 5%). Conclusions: Cine-MR is a very accurate procedure in the assessment of left ventricular volumes and functional heart parameters. It should not only be used for follow-up studies but also for routine applications.",

Seventeen patients who had undergone cardiac operations, and were admitted for cardiac reoperation were investigated with CT and/or MRI prior to sternal reentry. Five patients were investigated with CT, ten with both CT and MRI and two with MRI only. Retrosternal adhesions were classified as present or absent, intrapericardial adhesions were classified; absent, minimal, moderate or severe at re-operation. A similar classification was applied to the findings at CT and MRI. In 14/15 patients, the findings at CT were in accordance with those found at operation regarding postoperative retrosternal extrapericardial adhesions in the cranial retrosternal space, and in 12115 in the caudal retrosternal space. CT could not detect intrapericardial adhesions. MRI was sensitive to metal artefacts from sternal sutures in both sequences and could therefore not be used to detect postoperative retrosternal extrapericardial adhesions. MRI with ECG-gated SE sequences confirmed intrapericardial adhesions in 44/57 locations. Absence of intrapericardial adhesions revealed at operation was shown in 13 locations.",

Results: A step-by-step approach to the application and the unique abilities of this new technology are illustrated in I. the diagnosis of vascular disease not evident by angiography; 2. accurate calculation of stenotic area; 3. sonographic characterization of pathologic deposits; and 4. effects in interventional procedures with special emphasis on intimal flaps and dissections after angioplasty. Conclusions: The broad spectrum of arteriosclerotic disease is within the reach and resolving power of catheter-based intravascular US.

The signs of changes in atherosclerotic obstructive disease and the advantages and handicaps of this technique are summarised in the poster. The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is closed with conical-shaped device which consists of polyurethane foam mounted on stainless steel frame. The plug is delivered into the duct through the transvenous Teflon sheath. Since 1981 till 1991 the procedure was undertaken in 262 pts. Permanent complete duct closure was achieved in 248 (94,7%). In 7 cases the occlusion was partial. The complications occurred in 10 pts. There were migration of the plug into the abdominal aorta in 4 pts, wrong fixation of the device in the left subclavian artery origin -2 pts, preliminary fixation of the plug on the wall of the descending aorta -I pt, migration of the plug into the pulmonary artery bed -3 pts. 7 of these failures were treated surgically. After 10 years of experience we consider the developed technique as very effective, safe and applicable in more than 80% of patients with PDA in the age older than 2,5 years.",

Knowledge of the potential vascular malformations and variants in the pelvis and legs is essential for the correct interpretation of US. Familiarity with such variations can provide a correct diagnosis and obviate the need of venography. The aim of this study was to evaluate these vascular anomalies with US using venography for correlation. In 145 patients (169 extremities) with clinically suspected DVT of the lower extremity a venography and an US were performed. In these examinations we have found some venous anomalies, such as bifurcation of the femoral or popliteal vein, and several pathological conditions, such as venous aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas, that may lead to diagnostic problems in patients with suspected DVT. Other potential diagnostic pitfalls of US are small nonocclusive thrombi, e1(traluminal compression of the deep veins caused by soft tissue abnormalities, positive compression US-test in some fresh thrombi, which may be slightly compressible, non-adequate performance of compression US in obese patients and other possible interpretative errors caused by technical limitations of the study.

The indication for operation was either recurrent pulmonary emboli Dr prophylaxis against emboli from pelvic Dr deep vein thrombosis. In 2 cases implantation of a caval filter was not attempted due to a low take-off of the renal veins. In the remaining 22 patients a Guenther caval filter was successfully placed. Seventeen patients could be followed with a mean follow-up of 14 months .. Results: In no patient was th~re clinical evidence of new pulmonary emboli after successful implantation of the caval filter. An occlusion of the inferior vena cava was found in one patient ahd a caudal dislocation of the caval filter in 6 patients. In one patient one of the fixation feet of the caval umbrella broke. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the Guenther caval filter has both a low complication rate and a high success rate with regard to the prevention of recurrent pulmonary emboli. The vascular wall of patients during the active phase of Takayasu's aortitis (T A) was investigated on CT. Four female patients, aging 12-22 years, were examined. Final diagnosis ofTA wa, made by both clinical findings and aortography. The vascular wall thickness and the ratio of the thickness to inner circumference of common carotid arteries and thoracic aorta were calculated. These items were compared with normal anatomic values. Findings of the vascular wall before and after the administration of contrast medium were also examined. The vascular wall thickness and the ratio to inner circumference were markedly increased in all cases. On plain CT, the vascular wall clearly distinguished from the vascular lumen by similar to or higher density than that of the muscle. Following contrast medium injection, the wall showed a \"double ring-like pattern\"; a poorly enhanced inside ring and a densely enhanced outside ring. The inside ring is considered to be mucoid or gelatinous swelling of the intima. while the outside ring be an active medial and adventitial inflammatory change with neovascularization.

The low-speed rotational transluminal angioplasty catheter system (ROTACS) is a recently available device for recanalization prior to PTBA. Heavily calcified occlusions and the presence of a large collateral originating proximal to the occlusion, constitute limitations for ROTACS. To avoid the entry of rotating catheter to the collateral, tip of the catheter is placed just proximal to the occlusion and the hard tip of a 0.020\" guide-wire is used to create an inlet by repeated small, probing movements carefully. Afterwards the tip of the ROTACS catheter is engaged in this inlet and started to rotate at low speed. When ipsilateral approach is not possible as there is no sufficient distance to place an introducer sheath between the puncture site and the occlusion, contralateral antegrade approach is considered. Follow-up angiographic examinations of the successfully recanalized and dilated 16 occlusions in 15 patients up to one year revealed 87.57% patency rate. We conclude that, creation ofa pilot inlet and cross-over S 239 recanalization will increase the number of candidates for the recanalization with ROTACS prior to PTBA.",

Methods: Forty-two patients aged from 15 to 71 years (average 48 years) were examined with contrast UFCT. Twenty patients had mitral regurgitation and \\0 patients had tricuspid regurgitation. Multislice cine mode UFCT scanning was performed to measure ventricular output with modified Simpson's method. Ventricular output (VO) was defined as follows: VO = stroke volume x heart rate. Flow mode UFCT scanning with bolus contrast injection was applied to measure cardiac output (CO) from time-density curve of the pulmonary artery and ascending aorta using Stewart-Hamilton's formula. Regurgitant fraction (RF) was calculated as follows: RF -(VO -CO)/VO. RF value was compared to the grade of regurgitation measured with cine angiography and/or Doppler ultrasonography. Results: Regurgitant fractions derived from UFCT scanning favorably correlated to the grade of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation measured with cine angiography and/or Doppler ultrasonography. Conclusions: Contrast UFCT could be used for precise quantitation of valvular regurgitation with combination of volumetry and densitometry. Furthermore, this method could separately measure the regurgitation of right and left side of the heart.",

Subsequently, these sections were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and than exposed to X-rays on high-resolution photographic plates. Slices of 5 11m thickness from these paraffin blocks were cut for histologic examination and correlated to microangiography. Results: In comparison to histology, microangiography visualizes cutaneous vascularisation in a greater volume. For this reason, microangiograms provide a nearly threedimensional overview of microcirculatory anatomy. Capillary loops in the papillae, the sub-papillary plexus, the glandular components (with the capillaries surrounding the sweat glands), the candelabra arterioles and the descending venous system in the cutis could be demonstrated over a prolonged course. Direct comparison between microangiographic and histologic pictures of the same tissue slice helps to differentiate artifacts from lesions. Results: -Initial results: disappearance of the claudication was noted in all patients with a mean 0,4 increase in the ankle-arm-index. A residual stenosis lower than 30% was noted in 16 cases (the severity of the residual stenosis was lower when the catheter used was a 9 french, and when the lesion was short and non calcified.

In case of intestinal infarction, angiography enables to distinguish occlusive from non-occlusive ischemia and can define nature and position of a lesion as well as the conditions of the distal vascular bed. Furthermore angiography represents an important method for both instrumental and pharmacological treatment. In the last decade we recorded in our Institute 40 cases of acute mesenteric ischemia. Nine patients underwent to global aortography and selective angiography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA); in 5 cases the examination was carried out by traditional technique (Dos Santos), whereas in 4 patients we performed digitalized angiography. The angiographic details of our cases are shown in the poster. We diagnosed in 4 cases embolism and 2 cases thrombosis of SMA main trunk, which later were surgically treated. One case of embolism of the distal branches of SMA and 2 cases of functional ischemia were successfully treated both by local and systemic conservative therapy. In this latter cases only the traditional angiography permits to display the morphology of the distal splanchnic vascular bed. In conclusion we believe that, in the angiographic diagnosis of the acute intestinal ischemia, it is still fundamental to combine traditional and digitalized angiographic techniques in order to supply a detailed map of the splanchnic circulation and therefore to suggest the most suitable therapeutic approach.",

Methods and Materials: 20 persons, including 6 healthy volunteers, 6 patients with impaired renal function and 8 patients with normal renal function were examined. The peak systolic, end diastolic and mean velocities were measured from a waveform of an interlobar artery. Pulsatility and Resistance Indices (PI, RI) were then calculated before and after the infusion of dopamine at doses of 2.5 and 5.0Ilg/kg/min. Results: The mean values of both indices were reduced during the infusion of the 2.5llg/kg/min dose and return to baseline levels during the infusion of the 5.0llg/kg/min dose. The reduction in the mean values of PI was statistically significant in all subgroups (p < 0.0 I-paired t-test). It has already been shown that dopamine at 2.5llg/kg/min increases renal perfusion in healthy subjects, so a reduction in indices was expected. However, similar changes produced in patients with and without renal impairement provides some new evidence that this also occurs in renal impairement. It was also demonstrated that the mean values of the indices were significantly higher in patients than in normals suggesting that renal vasoconstriction may occur in ICU patients with normal renal function. Finally, the use of Duplex Doppler Ultrasound as a non-invasive method for the clarification of renal haemodynamics' in humans it was clearly shown. The authors propose a new method of treatment of arterial hypertension by X-ray endovasular occlusion of the central adrenal veins. The use of the new method would help portalize adrenal venous blood circulation as well as to inactivate cathecholamines and aldosterone. The proposed method has bean successfully used in 34 cases of essential arterial hypertension as well as in cases of arterial hypertension caused by chronic pyelonephritis and glomerulonephrities. The results of the use of this method would make it possible to discuss at a new angle the treatment of patients of renindependent arterial hypertension complicated through secondary aldosteronism.",

Methods: Double-angulated multislice-multiphase images (using a 0.5 Tesla magnet) were recorded using spinecho TI and gradient echo sequences. MRI studies were analysed for right ventricular (RV) volumes, function, segmental wall motion, and diameters of pulmonary arteries and caval veins. These measurements were compared with pulmonary pressure measured within 48 hours of MRI. The underlying disease was in 3 pts. VSD, in 2 pts. ASD, 4 pts. suffered a drug induced pulmonary hypertension, 5 pts. had mitral valve disease, 2 pts. had multiple pulmonary embolism, and 5 pts. a dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition 10 healthy volunteers were studied. Results: Pts. with PH showed increased RV-volume indices and abnormal septal motion irrespective of severity of PH. RV function was reduced in 3 pts., tricuspid regurgitation was demonstrated in all pts. There was good correlation S 242 between pulmonary mean pressure and diameter of inferior vena cava (r = 0.82), right ventricular EF and volumes showed no significant correlation.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether platelets labelled with Tc-99m-HMPAO would allow evaluation of thrombogenicity shortly after intraluminal intervention. Autologous platelets, labelled with Tc-99m-HMPAO were re-injected an hour before angioplasty. Scintigrams were made before, as well as I and 4 hours after angioplasty. In 5 patients studies thusfar, accumulation of Tc-99m was found at all 6 sites of angioplasty one hour after intraluminal intervention.

These results demonstrate that this technique is a sensitive and rapid method to assessing the thrombogenicity of (damaged) endothelium and has a practical avantage above currently used methods because the total procedure (blood withdrawal-angioplasty-scintigraphy) can be performed within 4 hours.

A comparison was made of these results with cardiac function parameters determined by echocardiography, cardiocatheterization, cardiac blood pool scintigraphy. A study was then made regarding the evaluation of cardiac function by hANP. Methods and Materials: Measurement of serum hANP was performed by radioimmunoassay. Testing was performed on 58 subjects consisting of 23 cases of ischemic heart disease, 30 cases of valvular disease and 5 cases other related disorders. Results: In the elevated hANP group, left ventricular ejection fraction and cardia index were significantly lower in comparison to the normal group, and hANP renected a decrease in left ventricular function. Also in the elevated hANP group, left atrial diameter was significantly increased in comparison to the normal group, and a significant positive correlation was observed between hANP and mean right atrial pressure. It was concluded that hANP become elevated accompanying extension of the atrial wall, and a parameter which reflects decreased left ventricular function.",

Between August and October 1990, 10 consecutive patients underwent double localization and then surgery. The first localization is performed the day before surgery. placing by means of mammography a self-retaining anchor wire needle near the lesion; the second localization is performed immediately before surgery, injecting a Methylen Blue solution through a lateral-holed needle. This needle is introduced cannulating the previously placed wire. The Methylen Blue solution spreads through the lateral holes situated in the last cm near the point of the needle. making a dye track that leads to the lesion. In our 10 cases the dye track was always well visible. with a width until 1.2 em around the wire.

The radiographic lesion size ranged from 2 to 40 mm (mean 13 mm) and 15 cases had previous diagnosis of malignancy in the contralateral breast. Suspicion of malignancy was based on the presence of the following radiological patterns (given together with their Positive Predictive Value PPV): I/microcalcification alone (PPV 0.40). 21stellate opacities (PPV 0.64), 3/asymmetric densities (PPV 0.16), 4/regular border densities (PPV 0.27), and 5/microcalcifications associated with 2, 3 or 4 (global PPV 0.46). Neither the presence of microcalcifications in a pattern of stellate opacities nor its prensence in a pattern of regular border densities seems to yield a higher suspicion index than both patterns alone (PPV 0.62 vs 0.64 and PPV 0.20 vs 0.27 respectively). On the other hand, the higher PPV (0.50) of asymmetric densities with microcalcifications compared to that of asymmetric densities alone (0.20) should be taken with caution due to the small number of cases.

Arko; Helsinki Even nowadays, X-ray mammography (XRM) cannot always reveal small breast cancers in breasts rich in dense normal glandular and/or mastopathic tissue. Ultrasound (US) is very sensitive for soft tissue characterization. In this study we tried to evaluate the quality of the methods for our routine breast diagnoses in our hospital. This material has been collected during a year 1988-89. All XRMs and US examinations and fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of breasts performed to these patients, were collected. 489 female patients underwent XRM and 293 patients of these underwent also US examination and 88 patients FNAB, too. All cases, found cytological diagnoses PAPA Gr III-Y were operated. Results indicated, that 25% of malignant nodules would have been missed, if only XRM would be performed. The results also revealed, that the smaller nodule and/or denser breast tissue, the better visualization will be reached by US compared to XRM. This study also indicated, that only 20% of breasts, found malignant tumour, had calcifications of malignant type, whereas in S246 cases, whose breasts contained malignant type microcalcifications in XRM, the malignancy was found in 50%. We did not found any calcifications in quarter of the cases, found malignant tumour histologically. In conclusion we can present, that soft tissue breast examination by US must be performed always, especially, when dense normal glandular and/or mastopathic tissue is found in one or more quarters of a breast. That means. that number of unnecessary breast operations will be reduced and more sparing breast operations can be performed. Purpose: To evaluate the role of double-contrast ductography or pneumoductography in the diagnostic evaluation of small intraductal lesions that can be obscured by contrast material used in the routine single-contrast ductography Methods and Materials: After routine single-contrast ductography and evacu\u00b7 ation of the contrast material, we inject 0.5 to 2 ml of air using a small 2 ml syringe that is connected to a catheter inserted in the duct. Routine mammographic examination is performed prior to removal of the syringe and catheter in order to avoid air reflux. Results: We used double-contrast ductography in 25 patients with a mean age of 46.8 years. Pneumoductography showed two 3 mm elevated lesions that were not seen during routine single-contrast ductography. Intraductal papilloma was diagnosed in both cases by histologic examination. Also our doublecontrast technique allowed us to differentiate intraductal lesions from artifacts seen during routine single-contrast. All the patients tolerated well the procedure and we did not find any complication. We conclude that double-contrast ductography or pneumoductography is a complimentary technique to routine single-contrast ductography in the diagnostic evaluation of small lesions in the main duct. Pneumoductography allowed us a detailed view of the main duct walls and helped in differentiating true intraductal lesions from artifactual filling defects observed during routine ductography.",

Surgical procedures ranging from radical mastectomy to lumpectomy with or without radiation. When lumpectomy is achieved a wide variety of postoperative mammographic abnormalities may be found: skin changes parenchymal scar, fat necrosis, asymmetric glandular tissue defect and local recurrence imaging may be stood out. We searched 29 cases of breast carcinoma in last three years in whom lumpectomy was achieved in our institution. We show mammographic imaging of those postsurgical abnormalities and radiologic evolution. We emphasize differential criteria which can help distinguish benign scarring from malignant local recurrence. Study included 105 unselected breast cancer female patients diagnosed and treated at the Osijck General Hospital, Yugoslavia. All patients were over 30. The procedure included clinical examination. mammography. surgery with pathohistology and steroid receptor levels. The aim was to assess the reliability of parenchymal patterns in predicting the steroid receptor status and to correlate steroid receptor levels and mammographic patterns with age and menopausal status of the patients. No significant associations were observed between the steroid receptor content in the primary tumor and mammographic parenchymal patterns, suggesting that it is not possible to predict hormonal dependency from the mammographic pattern. P2 and Dy pattern were more frequent among premenopausal and patients under the ago of 50. (P2 44.2%, Dy 32.6%). Lower shares were observed in the group over 50 (P2 37.1 %, Dy 22.6%). Observation was not significant (t-values 0.37 for P2 and 1.12 for Dy: p > 0.05). Estrogen receptors correlated strongly with age (maximum at the age of 60; N -77: R = 0.37: p < 0.01). Progesterone receptors showed no significant correlation with age of patients but correlated with menopausal duration (maximum 20 years after menopause, N = 40: R = 0.39; p < 0.05).",

We studied 84 female patients admitted consecutively at a surgical department of an oncological hospital with mammographic suspicious lesions. All patients were subject to a standard physical examination, axillary view and ultrasound performed by independent physicians. 31.5% patients had a histological diagnosis of benignity. Of the remainder, 82% were subject to an axillary dissection and there were 40% of metastases in axillary lymph nodes. Physical examination presented the higher specificity (92.4%), but a very low sensitivity (45%). Ultrasound had the higher sensitivity, 80%, with 88.7% specificity. There were no false positives in patients with benign disease. However, all methods failed to detect lesions smaller than 5 mm.

Shapira; Kfar Saba 5 cases of various radiopaque foreign bodies in the breast tissue were found in mammography. All women presented with discomfort and pain. In two of them a mass was also palpable. In three of the patients unreported catheter was found to be for therapeutic purposes: no additional breast pathology was found. In the other two cases remains of previous surgical procedures causing the palpable masses were seen. These unexpected mammographic findings explained the patient's complaints and in fact mammography was the only study required to evaluate these women. Purpose: Breast sonography can be used to differentiate cystic from solid masses, and to characterize masses as an adjunct to mammography. The combination of mllmmography and sonography can characterize with liability a high percentage of breast disorders. However in some cases the differentiation between benign and malignant breast conditions is difficult. The purpose of our work is to evaluate the role of duplex-Doppler sonography in the evaluation of breast masses. Methods and Materials: All the women with solid breast masses assisted in our Service over a 9-month period, were included in the study. A real-time sonography unit with Dopper capabilities was used for the breast examination. A 7.5 MHz transducer (5 MHz for Dopper analysis) was employed. The range gate sampling was 2-4 mm. The lowest available filter of the Doppler unit (100 Hz) was selected. The scale of the velocity range of the spectral display was set at 0.25 m/sec. Fine-needle aspiration-biopsy was performed on all patients immediately after sonography. Results: In more than 50% of the patients with breast cancer there was positive tumor flow signals. No patients with benign breast conditions showed positive Doppler signal. Therefore, duplex-Doppler sonography can play an useful role, as an adjunct to mammography and sonography, in the evaluation of breast masses.",

We have tried to establish a correlation between the images obtained by mammography and those obtained by sonography. We have observed that the presence of nodules in the mammography, which we diagnosed as being small cysts or fibroadenomas, do not have sonographic reciprocity in certain cases. Moreover dense breasts, that have evenly fibrous aspect may have cysts of up to several mm of 0. We believe that sonography confirms the need of a new classification of breast fibrocystic diseases, the review of the concept of mastopathy and the normality, of many explorations diagnosed radiologically as diffuse intraglandular disease. The use of sonography and mammography together allows to establish a more precise diagnosis of benign breast diseases, and helps to confirm the presence or absence of nodules in dense breasts without palpable masses. We present a preliminary report on a breast cancer detection program in hospital workers, which was begun in January 1989, and it was controlled and carried out by the Radiodology Department and the Preventive Medicine Department in the General Hospital Vall d'Hebron of Barcelona. It was a part of the main general reviews in the feminine workers of the hospital. The program included the female hospital workers older than 45 and consisted in a physical examination and a double view mammogram. The patients that accomplished the revision were 336 (37.7% of the 892 who were convocated). An elevated incidence of carcinoma was confirmed, 4 cases representing a 1.2 %. It probably represents the high prevalence of the disease, a fact reported by many authors in their first examination. We made an ultrasonographic study in 169 breast lesions included under two conditions: I. Either clinical or radiological breast lump, and 2. Tumor bigger than 5 mm. All the lesions were studied by ultrasound (US) and by a two-view mammography. A new US maneuver is described and evaluated: The a. p. axis was measured and how it shortened under US probe-compression, classifying the lesions as probably malignant and definitively benign according to this sign alone. Three different patterns were observed: I. -Malignant pattern. Those tumors with an upper compression limit of I mm.

Fatty tumors (lipomas. hamartomas), and the biggest cysts (more than 2 cm). Not any malignant lesion was observed to diminish far more than I mm. Results: Based on generally principles of elasto-mechanics an infiltrating mammary carcinoma can be recognized by a concentration of structures resulting from the concentrated tension and elongation. This finding can be demonstrated arithmetically and by stress analysis. Further advantages of this Mammo-Elastogram are as follows: I. Better view of the retromamillary space. 2. Inclusion of the tissue which were contiguous to the pectoral wall into the x-ray beam. 3. Control of the mobility of suspect mammary inclusions regarding the compression of peritumoral structures. 4. Enlargement of the radiological projection of organs and thus a better view of detail. 5. Always the nipple marginally on the picture, giving a clear point of reference as to the localisation of the tumor. Conclusions: Analogous with the retraction phenomenon which we have clinically in cases of breast carcinomas and proved by stress analysis, these tension and elongation concentrations which can be visualised radiologically and which have been described above. turn out to be most reliable radiological signs of malignity.",

Our cOOlribution is concerning two cases both occurred in the elderly (above 80 y.). Mammographic pattern was characterized by a cluster of round or oval, smoothly circumscribed areas of density in one quadrant of a breast. In both patients, calcifications were found (finding not previously reported). Sonography revealed hypoechoic solid, smooth-walled abnormalities. In agreement with others (I), we believe that the diagnostic imaging of the breast may be suggestive for invasive papillary carcinoma. It is noteworthy that the presence of malignant calcifications cannot rule out the diagnosis of papillary breast carcinoma when the well-known pattern is shown at mammography. The mammographic check-up is developing more and more among people and it involves asymptomatic women, for whom the age represents an indication to the test. Mass media have certainly influenced this line of conduct, so that the number of patients now turning to the clinical mammography is getting higher and higher. The frequency of check-up shall depend on the \"kind\" of breast, i.e. its clinicalradiological characteristics, together with the careful evaluation of the risk factors. We have considered 20.000 women who underwent mammography; the under 35 have been excluded from this study, since this age class is not covered by the records. Normal cases were 17.100 (85.6%), neoplasias 120 (3.7%), while in 2.150 cases (10.7%) mammography gave suspicion data (Class R3) and required percutaneous or surgical bioptic checks. The diagnostic accuracy of the enquiries by image on the breast shall have the false positive as its term of comparison, which, more than the false negative, represents the real \"mistake\" in Senology.",

The youngest was a 12 year old and the oldest a 85 year old. The radiological findings were as follows: 137 cases af gynecomastia, three abscesses, three inflammatory mastitis, three epidermoid cysts, one simple cyst and a 18 years old boy with gynecomastia, two cases with intramammary lymph nodes, two myofibroblastomas, one leiomyoma of the nipple with breast tissue infiltration and six malignant breast tumors. We present the most relevant cases of these mammographic studies of male breast pathology with special mention on gynecomastia and those cases hardly reported on the literature such as myofibroblastoma and leiomyoma of the nipple with breast tissue infiltration. Purpose: Salmonella typhi splenic abscesses (SA) are classically a rather rare complication of typhoid fever (TF). The aim of this study was to stress the role of US and CT to the diagnosis and follow up for these patients. Methods: 400 patients with proven biological diagnosis ofTF were systematically examinated by abdominal US. 20 patients with either persistent or recurrent symptoms (despite adequate treatment) or presenting acute lower thoracic pain, were performed again by US and CT with contrast media. Results: In 8 patients, both imaging modalities revealed anomalies compatible with splenic abscesses; none of these patients had classical predisposing factors such as sickle cell disease. 1 patients were treated by splenectomy. In one case of small splenic abscess, repetitive US controls allowed follow up of total regression of abscess under medical treatment only. Conclusions: SA are not so rare as previously described. Non invasive imaging modalities like US combined with CT allow the exact diagnosis and improve the prognosis by preventing a possible fatal issue like splenic rupture and peritonitis.

The purpose of this exhibit is to evaluate the usefulness ofCT in gastric diseases and to present the different CT features and their correlations with gastric lesions. We reviewed the radiological findings in 52 cases of gastric process. Congenital, neoplastic and inflammatory etiologies are included. Barium studies, endoscopy, surgical and pathological findings are correlated with CT findings. Gastric wall thickening and mass effect are the most common findings. CT features in several cases can suggest the diagnosis and could be the only radiological sign of disease. Authors present 5 case reports illustrating the diagnostic and therapeutic problems in management of portal hypertension caused by abnormal arterio-venous anastomoses. In all cases US with Doppler studies and CT with angio-dynamic procedure were performed as a first, non-invasive method. These studies showed the placement, width and patency of vessels, direction and level of blood-flow. Angiographies, performed in all cases as the most specific method, showed the details of anatomy of anastomoses (fistulas). These enabled us to introduce the best way of treatment -embolization or surgical procedure. The studied material included 51 patients in whom for recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices 54 different porto-systemic shunts were performed (portocaval shunt in 31 cases, splenorenal shunt modo Linton in 6 cases, spleno-renal shunt modo Warren in 6 cases, mesenterica-caval modo Drapanas -4 cases, other types -3 cases). The anatomical condition of each shunt, direction of blood flow and collaterals were diagnosed by US with Doppler studies and CT with dynamic-angio procedure. Both methods allowed a simple and safe visualisation of porto-systemic anastomoses. CT is more sensitive and specific in diagnosis, especially of port-caval shunts, and can be used in early postoperative period. US is the useful method for long-term monitoring of the shunt condition.",

Methods and Materials: In the dynamic CT Toshiba CT 900S was used. We administrated non-ionic hypotonic contrast medium by bolus injection in normal volunteers (16 males, 14 females) to a slice that allows a simultaneous grasp of the abdominal aorta and main portal vein for dynamic CT. We constructed time density curves of the abdominal aorta and main portal vein on the basis of picturers obtained, named the ratio of area of each steep rise portal blood flow coefficient.

All proximal and distal anastomoses are well viewed. The average passage time from proximal anastomosis to the i1eocoecum is 20 to 30 minutes. (n = 15). 11 patients showed an increased time: 2 with diarrhoea. 6 patients showed a decreased time: I with obstipation. Jejunoesophageal reflux was seen in 26 patients (81 %). Only 7 needed therapy for esophagitis. The feeding loop was viewed in 19 cases. d) Barium double contrast examination seems to be useful for showing the feeding jejunal loop (56%) in case endoscopy fails. The high number of jejunoesophageal reflux and variable passage times do not correspond with clinical complaint. Methods: After the occasional observation in a nourished baby of good contrast delineation of the upper 01 tract, we tried a series of different commercial fresh and lyophilized milks both in experimental and in clinical tests. The laboratory evaluations were made with a .5 T while imaging was performed with an 1.5 T magnet. After the selection of the most effective lyophilized product, prepared in conformity with commercial intructions, we examined a group of patients with gastric and rectal cancer. Results: The most intense positive contrast effect, due to shortening of the TI relaxation time, was obtained with Nidina I (Nestle'). This attitude is related to the concentration of the paramagnetic ions (Mn-Fe) binded in the macromolecules of milk, such as casein. The best imaging sequence was a spin-echo Tl.w. After ingestion of milk a good delineation of the stomach with sufficient distribution in duodenum and in the very proximal bowel was achieved as well as a good depiction by enema of rectum and recto-sigmoid junction. Conclusions: The practical value of this paramagnetic complex depends on its non invasivity, economicity and acceptability thus we suggest the use of the lyophilized milk \"Nidina I\" in patients with gastric and rectum-sigmoid cancer in order to increase the diagnostic efficacy of MR.",

The pathological appearance of this rare entity is characterized by the presence of multiple permanent bloodfilled cysts of variable size. Methods: After US detection. CTwith contrast agent injection, DSA and MRI were used in all patients and the data correlated with the pathological findings obtained by aspiration cytology (n -2), percutaneous biopsy (n = I), and surgical biopsy (n = I). Results: US demonstrated nodular lesions, which were confirmed by CT as hyperdense lesions after contrast media bolus injection, without any finding in favor of malignancy or benignity. The MRI appearance evoked potentially malignant lesions based on the heterogeneous signal intensity without major increase on T2-weighted images. On the other hand. DSA appeared as the more adapted imaging modality to approach the right diagnosis. demonstrating an early opacification lasting at the venous phase. From these four patients. DSA could be suggested as the more specific imaging modality to orient the diagnosis and the pathological evaluation.",

Roberto Bonardi; Crema Purpose: This report shows the results obtained by US-guided PEl in 15 patients affected by small HCC (diam 3 cm). Methods: PEl consisted in 2 weekly sessions (max II for each nodule). The dye (2-4 cc per session) was injected by means of a US-guided fine spinal needle. In S250 addition to nodule US changes. the criteria confirming the success of this treatment were: a) absence of malignant cells at the final FNAB; b) lack of enhancement during the TC arterial phase and formation of a peripheric hyperdense ring. US, TC and the AFP levels were used for follow-up. Results: All patients are still alive and in only one case, recurrencies of the neoplasia were reported. The follow-up varies from I to 24 months. Nodules have progressively reduced and in some cases they have disappeared. US shows a nearly constant posterior acustic shadow revealing the postnecrotic fibrosis. Treatments have been usually well tolerated by all patients. Conclusions: Since surgery is influenced by the conditions of cirrhotic patients. PEl. being easily available, can be a successful alternative for small HCC. The main disadvantages of PEl are due to the site of the tumor and the hardness of the cirrhotic liver which might cause deviations of the fine needle. Five patients with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma were treated; four of them for a period of two years. The fifth patient who was treated for eight years underwent surgery several times. Four patients had insignificant clinical pictures. Computed tomography (Cn examination revealed typical irregular thickening of peritoneum and tumor of omentum. The diagnosis was later confirmed by the cytologic evaluation. In one case the MPM diagnosis was confirmed by histologic evaluation after surgery. All patients were treated with systematic cytostatic therapy combined with radiotherapy. The success of the therapy was monitored by ultrasound (US) and CT. The response to the treatment was satisfactory. The remissions were of different duration. Four of five patients died. The results of diagnosis of MPM with US and CT and the success of therapy for five patients are described. ",

We reviewed 10 cases of jejunum and ileum malignancies diagnosed from 1977 to 1989 in our institution, with histopathologic correlation. They were 4 men and 6 women. Ranging age from 22 to 82 years (mean 59 years). More usual clinical symptoms were abdominal pain and weight loss. Topographic localization was jejunum in 6 cases and ileum in 4 cases. Radiologic imaging was strongly suggestive of malignancy in 7 cases: 6 showed a typical annular \"napkin-ring\" configuration, one of them simultaneously presenting 2 lesions in jejunum; and the other displayed destruction of the mucosa with a large ulcerating lesion. In 3 cases radiological findings were atypical: mucosal diffuse involvement with gross folds of whole small bowel; lesion of terminal ileum suggestive of Crohn's disease, and one patient had no radiologically detectable abnormalities. Aim of our study is to define the different semiological aspects of the gastrointestinal ultrasonographic \"target\" sign. The purpose of this study is therefore to search for the various features of the \"target\" that can help in the differential diagnosis of disease that cause bowel thickening. The ultrasound examination was performed with 7 MHz linear probe. together with a plain XR of the abdomen in a large number of patients (over 100) with acute abdomen, intestinal occlusion or subocclusion. Ultrasonographic findings were afterwards compared to the radiological, surgical or artificial diagnosis. The \"target\" sign found in Crohn's disease, in lymphoma, in peritoneal carcinomatosis, in intestinal infarction, in volvulus. in intussusception, in acute appendicitis have different morphological features (radial target in lymphoma, irregular and thick target in carcinoma, etc.) that, together with clinical data, have shown a high diagnostic specificity. Purpose: The aim of this study was to present the CT and US findings of midgut malrotation, with and without volvulus, and to show by US a well known CT sign of volvulus in intestinal malrotation (whirl-like encircling loops of bowel around the mesenteric vessels). Methods and Materials: Five patients (age range: 16-31 years) with midgut malrotation (one of them with volvulus) were studied with CT and US .

Recently stainless steel biliary stents became a new alternative to the conventional endoprostheses because of the high frequency complication of the latter. We placed self-expandable metallic mesh stents for the treatment obstructions. Methods and Materials: Self-expandable mesh stents have been placed in 13 patients. Ten patients had malignant obstruction and 3 patients had benign strictures as a result of several surgical interventions to the biliary system. We placed Wall stents (Medinvent, Switzerland) with diameter of30 F when fully open. Results: No major complications observed. The mean follow-up period was 6 months and during the follow-up all the stents were patent. One patient died of his disease on the 39th day after ihe procedure. Conclusions: The initial result suggests that metallic stents can be used successfully instead of conventional endoprostheses which have relatively small diameter and high complication rate. Also the ability of the placement of Wallstents through a 7F catheter reduces the risks of the procedure. Our results are encouraging. We believe that further studies will clarify the long-term success.",

Septal appearance (thin < 3 mm and thick> 3 mm), parietal nodules \u00ab0) than 2 cm) and calcification frequency are also studied. We note other features like ascitis, bilaterality, good delimitations by capsule, etc. We show echographic features in each tumoral group: epithelial tumors (C.Ad., C.adca.), stroma gonadal tumors, germinal cell tumors (teratoma, etc.) mesenchymal tumors (fibromas, thecomas, etc.), metastasis, etc. As all of you know, echography is a high fyability method for detecting masses, but not so much for establishing a diagnosis. We propose you some echographic features that you can use in differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors. Purpose: To improve radiologic presurgical assessment of hepatic neoplasms we have evaluated technique, findings, accuracy and limits of CT angiography and portography. Methods: From January 1989 to December 1990 we have performed intraarterial CT in 33 patients affected by primitive or secundary hepatic neoplasms. 10 cases were porto-CT, 23 were arterio-CT. All patients previously underwent US and angiography, 23 patients Lv. angio-CT, 12 RM, 26 percutaneous fine needle biopsy. These methods did not exclude surgical treatment. Subsequently 15 patients underwent surgery or laparotomy; the remainders were periodically observed. Results: Interpretation of arterio-CT findings was difficult in 50% of cases: transient vascular contrast enhancement caused images not always demonstrated for localizing tumor set. The accuracy of portal CT has been superior to all diagnostic methods in regard to number, seat and size of lesions. The results of both methods decreased in patients with arterial anomalies. Intra-arterial CT has been useful to exclude surgery in 30% of patients not previously excluded by US or conventional CT. Conclusions: Intra-arterial-CT is useful in presurgical evaluation of hepatic tumor. Hepatic arterio-CT is better than porto-CT to recognize neoplastic nature of lesions; we prefer porto-CT in evaluation of size, number and seat of lesions. When angiography demonstrates vascular anomalies results of intraarterial-CT decrease.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and describe the US, CT and conventional radiological appearance of MA and other liquid space-occupying lesions of the right iliac fossa. especially in cases of difficult differentiation beween these lesions. Our report includes 20 patients: 3 cases of MA and 17 cases of other cystic masses in the right middle and lower abdominal quadrant. such as mesenteric cysts, Iymphoceles, benign ovarian cysts, malignant ovarian tumors (cystadenocarcinoma. malign cystic teratoma), abscesses, malignant coecum tumor, psoas pancreatic pseudocyst and hematomas. In all these cases the lesions showed similar US and CT features, so that the definitive diagnosis only by means of US/CT puncture or drainage and/or intraoperative could be established. In this scientific exhibit these cases are presented and discussed. I.

We studied thirty patients and evaluated each of them on hard copy, high resolution monitor and conventional radiograpbies. The images were assessed by three well trained radiologists. The identification of biliary tree and/or pancreatic duct was mad.e by endoscopy retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous cholecystomy or transhepatical cholangiography (TCP). 3. Our results show a quite good correlation between the digital images and the conventionals. The degree of diagnostic accuracy is high and comparable in both of them. However. the post-processing facility of the digital radiography improves image quality. affords greater flexibility in image display. yields always consistent contrast on images. avoids incorrect exposure repetitions, reduces exploration time. 4. Computed radiography seems to be a good alternative to conventional radiography for pancreatic-biliary examinations. Permanent archiving of images and their retrieval and reevaluation possibility is really useful. The digital system also conveys a remarcable lowering of the radiation dose.

Eighty-nine patients without pancreatic disease served as controls. Pancreatic disease cases included 23 pancreatic carcinomas with or without pancreatitis, 4 cholangiocarcinomas invading the pancreas, 4 extrapancreatic masses mimicking primary pancreas neoplasms. and 9 cases of pancreatitits. Axial TI-weighted (TR = 500-600; TE = 20), Proton-and T2-weighted (TR -2500-2700; TE = 30/S0) images using spin-echo sequences were obtained on a 1.5 T system. On TI-weighted images. imaging criteria were developed from measurements of pancreas size in eight sites. On T 1-. Proton-, and T2-weighted images. border definition, and signal intensity of the pancreas were compared with that of renal cortex, spleen, and fat to develop imaging criteria. Using this criteria, 21 of 40 pancreatic disease cases showed an abnormality of pancreas size. Total or partial obliteration of the pancreatic border was seen in 18 of 22 patients with evidence of pancreatitis on T2-weighted images. Signal intensities in tumor and pancreas were abnormal in 23 and 20, respectively. of the 40. All 4 extrapancreatic masses were differentiated from intra pancreatic tumors by T2-weighted images. M RI is useful in detecting abnormality of the pancreas. Purpose: We present our sonographic experience as radiologists-sonologists in the diagnosis of acute gynecologic diseases. Methods: A total of 49 abnormal sonographies were reviewed. Surgery was performed in 35 cases; the other 14 cases were resolved spontaneously. Our cases include: 23 ectopic pregnancies (E.P.), 8 pelvic inflammatory diseases (P.J.D.), 7 haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, 2 endometriomas. I ovarian torsion and I hematometra caused by an imperforate hymen. Conventional equipment (without transvaginal transducer) was always used. The sonographic signs were analyzed and integrated with clinic and biochemical findings. Results: Important signs in the diagnosis were: extrauterine gestational sac in E.P.; adnexal masses with septations, intracystic debris and/or high trough transmission in haemorrhagic masses or in P.LD. The sensibility in E.P. was 100%, specificity 80%, positive predictive value 88%, negative predictive value 100% and accuracy 92%. Conclusions: Sonography with conventional equipment has been very useful in the diagnosis of acute gynecologic pain.

Sonographic results were compared to histopathologic findings of surgical specimens. In this study a radial 7 M Hz and a linear array 5 M Hz transducer were used. Results: In this group of 54 patients intrarectal sonography proved to be accurate in 48 of 54 cases (accuracy 88%). The sensitivity for invasion of the perirectal fat was 94%, the specificity was 78%. The false negative results were influenced by transducer related artifacts and the experience of the radiologist. Two patients were understaged, four patients were overstaged. Patient selection and experience of the radiologist are necessary to reach high accuracy. Perirectal pathologic Iymphnodes could only be detected in a minority of cases (8) and the sensitivity was low (53%). Conclusions: Intrarectal sonography can give accurate preoperative information about extension of rectal carcinoma but is of limited value in detection of perirectal Iymphnode metastases.",

The catheter is inserted via Seldinger method into the nutrient artery of the tumour. We apply cytostatic drugs in form of the intraarterial slowly dripping infusion and partly in repeated injections. In most of the cases we try to carry out a microembolization with microcellulose which functions as the obliteration of the small arteriolas of a diameter 5-100 microns. We link cytostatic drug on the microcellulose and so we prolong the time of its effect in the pathological tumorous bed and partly the cytostatic effect is potentiated with induced ischemia. As far as the operation is not possible we repeated this way of treatment in intervals of6-8 weeks. With this therapy we treated 115 patients with colorectal carcinomas, 36 patients with tumours of kidney, 10 with hepatomas, 40 with metastatic tumours of liver, 7 with tumours of gallbladder and 15 with cancer of pancreas.

There is a large overlap in the C.T. appearances in most cases, although some conditions have features highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Some of the more unusual causes have been highlighted with illustrations, i.e. sub-capsular spread of hydatid cysts, mesenchymal hamartomas, cholangiocarcinoma, lymphoma. choledochal cysts, carcinoid tumours, and cystic haematoma.

Alomar; Barcelona CT and sonography have become the primary imaging methods for the detection of hepatic metastases and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, their success rate in detecting small lesions is low for planning surgery. New advances and increasing number of indications for hepatic resections have prompted the development of new methods with a greater sensibility. In recent years, several techniques, including CT with ethiodized oil emulsion (EOE-CT), delayed scanning, CT-angiography and Magnetic Resonance, have become available and are now frequently used to provide more complete information about the number of lesions, intrahepatic segmental location, and presence of portal vein thrombosis. CT angiographic techniques include CT-angiography (CTA), performed during contrast injection into the hepatic artery and CT during arterial portography (CTAP), the most commonly used. The purpose of this essay is to present the technique. results, and advantages of CTAP and illustrate the findings on hepatic tumors, particularly those that may be confusing. Several no reported causes of false positive or false negative CTAP scans are decribed. has allowed to avoid surgery in all cases. We had no complications. Large catheters allow a more efficient drainage, especially in case of thick debris. Thus, they may enhance the success rate and reduce the duration of percutaneous drainage. Purpose: To assess the usefulness of CT and MRI in diagnosis and management after liver transplantation. Methods: We reviewed the CT scans and MR examinations of 21 patients. The imaging studies were done between 2 days and 27 months after hepatic transplantation. MRI was performed at 1.5 T. All patients had state of the art CT examinations with iv contrast administration. Results: In all patients a periportal and pericaval edema due to disruption of lymphatic drainage was seen. This resolves, albeit slowly. The evolution and resolution of postoperative complications such as perihepatic fluid collections (N = \\1). hepatic perfusion defects (N =4) and hemorrhage of the right adrenal gland (N = 3) was documented. Several patients had biliary leaks, of which no evidence was seen on CT or MRI, confirming that these are not the primary imaging modalities for biliary pathology in hepatic transplants. Two patients received livers from child donors and another a \"reduced-size\" liver, i.e. only part of the donor liver was transplanted. Compensatory hepatic hypertrophy was visible as early as the seventh post-operative day. Conclusions: Many of the complications seen after liver transplantation are self-resolving, but monitoring with CT or MRI is useful to confirm resolution or reveal the need for therapeutic intervention. Duplex-doppler (DO) and most recently color doppler imaging (COl) have become established non-invasive imaging methods of the vascular compartments. Presently. MR is not yet considered diagnostic modality of choice to assess splancnic vessels thrombosis although being effective technique in evaluating flows. This prospective work was undertaken to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of doppler vs. fast MRI in making diagnosis of portal thrombosis (PVT). DO and COl was obtained respectively with Hitachi AU 450 and AU590 scanners with 3.5 MHz convex probes. MRI was performed with a 0.5 T apparatus using gradient echo sequences (70 ms TR; 13 ms TE, 70 FA) on breath-holding patients. Due to entry slice phenomena, this pulse sequence was very efficient in detecting portal flow andlor thrombosis with diagnostic resolution as far as the hepatic segmental branches. Flow within liver was assessed by axial plane. On the contrast, spleno-portal axis flow was determined by coronal sections. 12 patients with PVT (incomplete PVT in 2 cases; complete PVT in 3 cases; thrombosis of PV and its intrahepatic branches in 4 cases; portal cavernomas in 3 cases) were imaged with both techniques. Briefly, fast MRI demonstrated similar accuracy to doppler techniques in diagnosing thrombosis of the main PV but lower efficiency in detecting residual flow within incomplete PVT, canalized cavernomas and periportal collaterals.",

Materials were a total of 73 small HCC lesions less than 3 cm in 60 patients. In 44 of73 HCCs, clear dynamic MR images of HCCs were obtained. Diagnosis of the HCCs were confirmed surgically in 20 lesions, in 8 by biopsy and in 45 by various examinations including US, angiography, Dynamic CT, CT after Iipiodol infusion, CT during arterial portography, US under arterial infusion of CO2 micro-bubbles, color dopplering, and clinical data. Dynamic gradient echo MR images using fast low angle shot (FLASH) technique at 90\u00b7 pulse angle were obtained after bolus injection of Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol!kg) under suspended respiration. Eighty-two % of HCCs showed high-intensity on T2-weighted images. Ninetythree % of HCCs revealed enhancement of tumors at early phases after injection of Gd-DTPA on dynamic MR images. HCCs which did not reveal enhancement were highly differentiated HCCs, which showed high-intensity on TI-weighted images and iso-intensity on T2-weighted images. Dynamic MR) further increases the qualitative value of plain MRI diagnosis. The comparison with adenomatous hyperplastic nodules was also studied. Beh~et\"s syndrome is a multisystem inflammatory disorder, of unknown etiology, however some authors consider this entity as a vasculitis. Diagnosis focuses on clinical findings characterized by three major criterias: Recurrent aphtous oral ulcerations, genital ulcers and ocular inflammatory involvement. In addition Beh~et\"s syndrome can also involve many other organs and systems: Skin, vessels, gastrointestinal tract, etc ... Gastrointestinal tract involvement affects any location, predominating in colon and terminal ileum. Ulcers of varying size have the radiological appearance of a colitis. Differential diagnosis of Beh~et\"s syndrome must be carried out taking into account the possibility of inflammatory intestinal disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). In our study we present four patients diagnosed as having Beh~et\"s syndrome. Two of them developed gastrointestinal manifestations and radiologically severe pancolitis. The value of double contrast radiography of the esophagus, LES manometry and pH testing of esophageal reflux were comparatively assessed on 39 patients operated for sliding hernia. The time elapsed from surgery ranged from 2 to 9 years (mean: 5 years); in 7/39 patients clinical symptoms suggestive for disease recurrence were reported. X-ray examination showed a recurrent hiatus hernia in 4/39 cases (10%). Manometry revealed a LES in supradiaphragmatic position in the same 4 patients. PH testing did never demonstrate a gastro-esophageal reflux: however, an abnormal detersion time after acid test was observed in 4 different cases. There was a remarkable agreement between x-rays and manometric findings. The 4 patients with an abnormal radiographic and manometric picture were reoperated and the results of both investigations were confirmed by surgery. Double contrast examination of the esophagus and LES manometry may be considered the combined approach of choice for the diagnosis of recurrent sliding ernia and for the follow-up of operated cases. PH testing is a complementary procedure that can be useful for detecting the esophageal reflux which may be present without recurrent hiatal hernia.",

Methods and Materials: 98 examinations performed with 3.5-5 MHz external probes were reviewed with respect to 9 criteria including: unilbilaterality -size -echogenicity -wall and septa pattern -calcifications -fluid/fluid levelascites -metastases. These criteria were then used to predict benignity or malignancy of J 12 histological proven ovarian neoplasms. Results: Retrospectively, benign tumors (n = 25) are unilateral with anechoic or homogeneous solid pattern containing calcifications. Malignant tumors (n = 73) are more often bilateral with size exceeding 5 em and wall/septa are thick and irregular or predominantly echoic and heterogeneous solid pattern associated with ascites and metastases. Prospectively, ultrasound failed to diagnose 7 benign tumors (n = 37) and 9 malignant tumors (n -75). Conclusions: With an overall accuracy of 85.7%, a sensibility of 89% and a specificity of 75.6%, sonographic tumor type prediction with external probes is not enough reliable to affect the surgical practice to remove all ovarian masses. But the wide use of endovaginaJ high frequency probes should improve sonographic accuracy and specificity. Endoscopic extraction of common duct stones (CDS) is performed in patients who have had cholecystectomy and in other patients who are considered a poor surgical risk. In about 10% CDS cannot be removed, usually because the stone is too large to pass through the lower segment of the common bile duct. This paper describes our experience using a second generation lithotripter (Siemens \"Lithostar\") for CDS in patients in whom endoscopic extraction had failed or was not appropriate. With this machine no waterbath or general anaesthesia is required. Preliminary investigations to assess possible complications included: serum LFT's, U&E's. FBC, serum amylase, bile culture and urinalysis. Abdominal CTwas performed in the first 20 patients. 54 patients, 34-89 years old (mean 74.3 years), with common bile duct stones (6-36 mm) have been treated. All patients had nasobiliary catheters (52) or cholecystostomy tubes (2) in situ. Patients received 4000-6000 shocks per session over approximately 60 minutes. Seventeen patients underwent two ESWL sessions and two patients three or more sessions. Thirty-seven patients had one stone, ten had two and seven had three or more. Spontaneous clearance of fragments occurred in three patients and ducts were cleared endoscopically in a further 32 patients (total = 35 patients -65%). Fragmentation occurred in a further 9 patients but remaining fragments were large and have not yet been cleared. 10 patients stones remained unchanged. The response to lithotripsy was dependent on the size of stones, with number having little effect. ESWL was well tolerated without the development of any haematological, biochemical or CT abnormality. Second generation ESWL is a promising adjunctive treatment for CDS with a low complication rate, which compares favourably with elective surgery. when preliminary endoscopic extraction has failed. The position of the gallbladder (GB) was evaluated on 200 consecutive CT scans. 188 patients showed no significant hepatic abnormality and were used as controls to assess normal GB position. The GB angle was measured between the coronal plane and the axis of the GB. The normal range varied from 35\u00b0_75\u00b0 (mean 52\u00b0). The shortest distance of GB fundus to abdominal skin surface varied from 2-5 cm (means 3.2 cm). Although liver substance lay between fundus and skin surface in only 55% of controls, in no normal patient did the fundus project beyond the surface of the liver. Six of eight patients with cirrhosis, showed an abnormally positioned GB. In four, part or all of the GB projected beyond the surface of the liver. In two the GB fundus to abdominal skin distance measured more than 5 em. In all eight the GB angle remained within normal limits. Interposition of the colon between liver and anterior abdominal wall was also noted in 4. In two patients with lobar atrophy secondary to sclerosing cholangitis, the GB was malpositioned, although it maintained its normal position between the left and right lobes (GB angles 5\u00b0 and 20\u00b0). Two patients with large right intrahepatic masses, showed subsequent increase of the GB angle (90\u00b7 and 95\u00b0). These acquired mal positions of the GB due to cirrhosis. lobar atrophy and mass effect. have potential clinical implications with increased risk of inadvertent injury during percutaneous liver biopsy or interventional procedures and such procedures should be performed using image guidance.",

In this female patient. weighing 45 kilos, a diffuse increase of signal intensity was seen, ill-defined at the level of the hepatic parenchyma surrounding the gallbladder fossa. The alteration was related to contusive microtrauma (edema or microhemorrhages). Control study was performed at two weeks, and no residual alteration was evident.

Methods: 10 patients with hepatic malignancies undergoing angiography for different reasons were studied with MRAP. MR images were obtained with a 0.5 T superconductive equipment. Breath holding RASE sequences were acquired, with TR 230msec., TE 16msec., I Nex and 128 x 256 matrix. 6 slices are obtained in 30 seconds. Gd-DTPA was injected at a dose of 4 ml of 0.5 mmol/l solution, diluted in water. The injection was started 15 seconds prior to the beginning of the pulse sequences and lasted as long as the acquisition time (30 sec.). Results: Strong enhancement was observed in normal liver parenchyma, with values of Signal Enhancement over Noise (SE/N) of 9.5. The liver lesions did not present significant enhancement (measured value of SE/N -0.5). Distal to segmental portal vein occlusion no enhancement was observed in two cases. Conclusions: This technique provides selective hepatic enhancement. The use of RASE sequences is favourable because of the number of slice obtained and the high TI weighting. CT findings in 27 cases of surgically proved bowel ischemia are reviewed. Bowel ischemia is a common cause of acute abdominal pain. Clinical and laboratory data are unspecific and diagnosis is usually delayed, resulting in a high mortality. Radiologic diagnostic is also difficult. Barium studies and angiography are time-consuming, invasive or not specific. CT has been used increasingly to evaluate patients with acute abdominal pain, allowing identification of bowel ischemia findings. These include bowel changes (Fluid-filled loops, thickened wall, contrast mural enhancement and intramural low attenuation zones or air) and/or vascular changes (portal or mesenteric air. mesenteric vein thrombosis and mesenteric artery occlusion).",

Everyone were verified by surgery and/or biopsy. We have studied thirteen patients with cystic mesenteric tumors. Seven of them had real cysts, with revetment epithelium (3 serous cysts, I quilous cyst, 2 duplication cysts, I enteric cyst), three mesenteric pseudocysts which were not of pancreatic origin and three primary peritoneal echinococcus cysts. The most valuable criterions to diagnose them were established by CT and ultrasonography. They are: uni or multilocularness, wall thickness. evidence of calcium, fat density in CT and their location and relation with bowel loops. We have found twelve patients with primary solid tumors of the mesentery: 2 liposarcomas, 2 sarcomas, I peritoneal mesothelioma, 2 primary mesenteric lymphoma. 2 mesenteric desmoid.

Methods and Materials: Via a percutaneous needle (14 Gauge) a flat cleaved optical fibre (core diameter 600 m) was inserted into several sites of normal liver in four piglets under ultrasonographic guidance (5.5 MHz linear). To maximize lesion size. a low power (1.5 Watt) per lesion was administered during 600 s from a ND:Y AG laser (wavelength 1064 nm). Ultrasound lindings were correlated with histology at day 0, 7,14,21 and 28 and liver enzymes were tested at day 0, 1,2,7. 14,21 and 28. Results: During treatment ultrasound showed a growing echogenic zone with a maximum diameter of 2 cm around the fibre end which corresponded microscopically with a spherical coagulation zone. Central carbonisation in the lesion varied from I to 3 mm. Follow-up an inflammatory reaction with fibrosis, healing within 4 weeks and transient biochemical changes during the first week.

Previously a form of pulmonary tuberculosis had been diagnosed in these patienL~. All of them were subjected to CTscan: 5 to hepatic angiography and 20 to percutaneous biopsy of the liver under ultrasound guidance. In 25 subjects ultrasonography evidenced a nodular formation restricted to the liver whereas in the other 5 patients, besides at hepatic level. lesions were also present in the spleen. These formations were roundish with a diameter varying from 5 to 7 cm and presented a hyperechoic central area and a peripheral hypoechoic halo. Liver biopsy of the lesions under ultrasound guidance made it possible to evidence fact of inflammatory cells and more specific epithelioid cells in caseous necrotizing areas. Ziehl coloration revealed the presence of alcohol acid resistant bacilli. Treatment was started with Ethambutol 800 mg/day. pyridoxine 500 mg/day and INH 200 mg/day and was protracted from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 10 months. Patients rapidly improved and after a period of 5 to 9 months from the beginning of treatment. the ultrasonic and tomographic values returned to normal. Our results allow us to affirm that the hepatosplenic localization of tubercular disease is all but rare and must therefore be considered in differential diagnosis of space occupying lesions, at a hepatic as well as at renal levels, in the same way as other pathologies such as neoplasia, parasitic cysts etc. According to our data it is also possible to affirm that with adequate medical therapy the prognosis of these patients is good.

After i.v. administration of contrast medium, a slight to marked uniform enhancement was noticed. No calcifications were seen. Conclusions: The described CT-feature is not specific but highly suggestive of pancreatic involvement in NHL. Because of the different management of patients with NHL, neoplastic or inflammatory pancreatic disease, accurate and rapid diagnosis is essential. In the evaluation of postoperative complications of hepatic transplantation clinical and laboratory data usually do not provide a specific diagnosis. Thus imaging procedures are pivotal in characterizing parenchymal, biliary or vascular complications. The CT findings in the abdomen after liver transplantation as seen on 37 examinations in 33 allograft recipients are described. CT was most useful in the evaluation of parenchymal abnormalities of the allograft and in detection of extrahepatic fluid collections. Low density foci within the allograft parenchyma were seen in 18 patients (54%) and were associated with infection (4 cases), infarction and necrosis secondary to vascular insufficiency (6 cases), bilomas (7 cases) and one pseudoaneurysm that was causing a porto hepatic shunt. Localized extrahepatic fluid collections were present in 17 cases (51 %) corresponding to 6 bilomas, I hematoma and 7 free peritoneal fluid collections. 3 of the focal fluid collections were infected. Since the nature of these fluid collections could not always be determined by CT characteristics, fine needle aspiration wa.~ required in 8 cases for a specific diagnosis. Catheter drainage of fluid collections was performed using CT in 6 cases.",

The behavior of smooth muscle tumors of the intestine (leiomyoma, leiomyoblastoma, leiomyosarcoma) is of special interest because of the characteristics of their growth and dissemination. The aim of this communication is to assess the radiologic findings of their dissemination, both contiguous and distant, within the abdominal cavity. Thirty-five smooth muscle tumors of the intestine have been studied by means of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the features of the internal structure of the primary tumor and of the intraperitoneal metastases. They consist of one or more nodules formed by smooth muscle fibers and have a whorled appearance. Their marked tendency to degenerate at the center and the subsequent cystic transformation produce their known radiologic aspect. However, we demonstrate the frequency of the multi cystic transformation and the multi partitioned aspect that the primary tumors show on occasion. Nonetheless, the most interesting finding is that these masses grow by producing peripheral nodules which infiltrate neighbouring organs, detach and, by way of the peritoneum, are implanted far from the primary tumor. They also undergo cystic degeneration with one or more cavities, depending on the number of nodules. These US, CT and MRI findings are virtually pathognomonic signs, and can lead to the exact diagnosis of this type of abdominal tumoral process.",

We investigated if videol1uoroscopic studies of esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter yield results comparable to those obtained manometrically. Methods and Materials: Videofluoroscopy (Sirecord recorder) was performed in a standardized fashion with up to three swallows in the prone oblique and one swallow in the upright position. 29 patients (7m, 221) with dysphagia (n = 15). globus sensation (n = 5), noncardiac chest pain (n = 4) or scleroderma without symptoms (n = 5) were referred to radiography and manometry, carried out 0 to 64 days apart (median = Id). Data were analysed independently and without knowledge of the results of the respective other examination. Results: In 2 pts. manometry was not possible. Manometry was normal in 7 and abnormal in 20 pts. (Achalasia. 7; nonspecific contraction abnormalities, 7; hypo-or amotility in smooth muscle esophagus, 6). Videonuoroscopy had a sensitivity of 80% (16120 pts.) and a specificity of 100% (717 pts.). Videofluoroscopy identified 4 of 7 patients with achalasia. 6 of 7 with nonspecific contraction abnormalities and all with hypo-or amotility in scleroderma. Conclusions: It is concluded that videonuoroscopy is a valuable. although not perfect tool to screen for disordered esophageal motor function.

Purpose: To assess whether 31 P MR spectroscopy following a fructose load has potential as a clinical test of hepatic function. Introduction. The administration of fructose induces changes in the con centratk-:< of the phosphorous metabolites in the human liver. which can be monitored by means of 31 P MR spectroscopy. This has raised the expectation that 31 P MR spectroscopy following a fructose load might eventually constitute the basis of a test of hepatic function. In this study, we have assessed whether a number of prerequisites to the clinical use of the fructose load 31 P MR examination are met. Methods: IH image-guided 31P MR spectroscopy was applied. Reproducibility was assessed by repeating the fructose load 31 P MR examination 5 times on one particular healthy individual, over a period of several months. Biological variability of the 31 P M R response was evaluated on a population of 10 healthy individuals. Clinical applicability was verified by examining 10 patients suffering from cirrhosis. The 31 P MR spectra were measured sequentially, every 2 minutes. The spectral parameters were determined by fitting the 31 P MR signals by means of a model function.",

The cirrhotic livers generate reduced phosphate signal intensity, rendering difficult the interpretation of individual patient examinations. Conclusions: The accuracy and the excellent reproducibility of the 31 P MR response observed with the normal liver suggest that 31P MR spectroscopy following a fructose load has potential as a clinical test of liver function with hepatic disorders which do not cause a marked reduction in phosphate signal intensity.

For the 18 catheterisations of the hepatic artery, distal hyperselective catheterisation of the proper hepatic artery in order to avoid Lipiodol embolism to the gastroduodenal, gastric or other anastomic arteries could be achieved using conventional diagnostic catheters (5 cases), or, if this was not possible, using an easy to use and non-expensive coaxial catheterisation system (13 cases). Radiological follow-up of the lesions was performed by means of a C.T.-scan, obtained 24 hours and 6 weeks after chemoembolisation. Further CT follow-up studies were performed depending on the clinical evolution. We report the computed tomographical evolution of 12 patients, which had a CT follow-up of at least 6 weeks. It appears that hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas have a tendency to diminish in volume, especially those which retain Lipiodol after 6 weeks, and that the survival under IA chemotherapy is lesser in patients with hypovascular tumors that do not retain Lipiodol.",

MR findings were correlated to in vivo MRI and with macroscopic and histologic results. Results: Ex vivo MRI permitted the detection of 2 other small neoplastic lesions less than 5 mm in size and a small angiomyolipoma of 5 mm. The results demontrated also the value of T2-weighted images in the diagnosis of small renal tumors. Regarding the peripheral capsule, they showed a poor correlation between MR findings and histopathologic results. Conclusions: Ex vivo MRJ seems to be able to improve the effectiveness of extracorporal partial nephrectomy of small renal tumors avoiding uncomplete conservative surgery in case of another intrarenal neoplastic lesion. -20 patients were studied for morphological anomalies and 15 patients underwent a flow study (transplanted kidney in 5 cases).

James l. Fishback. Samuel J. Dwyer III; Kansas City, KS Purpose: To explain the echographic appearance of normal renal tissues in terms of the acoustic properties and microscopic anatomy. Methods and Materials: Tissue characterization techniques and a low-resolution acoustic microscope \u00ab 15 M Hz) were used to measure speed of sound, attenuation and backscatter coefficients, and the average size and number density of scatterers for excised human and dog kidneys. Data were obtained between I and 15 MHz in the medullary and cortical regions as a function of the angle between the transducer beam axis and tissue structures. Parametric images of acoustic parameters were obtained using clinical instrumentation for comparison with B-mode images. Results: The attenuation and backscatter coefficient values exhibit a significant directional dependence, which is more pronounced at frequencies > 5 MHz. Both measurements increased when the transducer beam axis was oriented perpendicular to structures such as the medullary rays. Backscatter anisotrophy was highly correlated with scatterer number density; the scatterer size and speed of sound measurements were isotropic. The dominant scattering structures below 5 MHz are the renal corpuscles. Above 5 MHz, scattering from renal tubules and blood vessels dominate, as indicated by greater anisotrophy and scatterer size measurements. Several of these methods may be used in vivo to identify anatomical changes associated with pathology. To obtain objective and reproducible results of prostatic size and echo pattern, patients must undergo transrectal ultrasonography. The painless, noninvasive examination can be done in a short time (about 10 minutes) without special treatment of the patient, except for cleaning the rectum by giving an enema at least I hour before examination. It is advisable to use a real-time. biplane, 5 MHz transducer, which can be handled easily after being painless inserted into the cleaned rectum of the patient. During the last four years transrectal sonography was performed in 724 men, in each case the seminal vesicles and prostata were evaluated. The average age of examined men was about 71 years. In 73%(n = 528) of examined patients the volume of the prostate increased up to 80 cc. Benign prostatic hyperplasia yields a heterogeneous sonographic pattern. In the sonogram stroma tissue is of echo-poor appearance, while glandular tissue show a dense, lamellar echo pattern. The sonographic results were confirmed by biopsy and clinical investigations. In 15% prostatic cancer was detected. Transrectal sonography of the prostate, for revealing benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most valuable noninvasive examination.",

Purpose: It is well known that there is a high incidence of the occurrence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with acquired renal cystic disease (ARCD) and it is considered to be difficult to diagnose RCC in ARCD by diagnostic imaging. No reports of the assessment of the diagnosis of RCC in ARCD by CT have been published. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to evaluate the capability of CT in the diagnosis of RCC in ARCD. 2. Methods and Materials: The subjects consisted of eight patients with pathologically proven RCC in addition to ARCD. Preoperatively, plain and contrast-enhanced CT was performed in all patients. Contrast enhancement was performed by the bolus injection technique. The CT findings were assessed retrospectively. 3. Results: The size of the RCCs ranged from 1.7 to 8 cm. Four tumors were solid and 4 were cytic. All tumors demonstrated contrast enhancement within the solid portion or the cyst wall, though the degree of enhancement tended to be less than that of tumors in normal kidneys. 4. Conclusions: We conclude that contrast enhancement is mandatory to detect RCC in patients with ARCD, and if a mass shows contrast enhancement the diagnosis of RCC should be considered.",

We have evaluated accuracy of CT and lymphangiography in nodal staging in a retrospective series of 95 patients. Methods: From January 1986 to April 198858 women were evaluated preoperatively by CT and lymphangiography (49 subsequently submitted to radical hysterectomy, the remainder underwent percutaneous fine needle biopsy). Other 37 patients previously treated were evaluated by CT for clinically suspected relapse. Results: In the first series accuracy was 91 %, sensitivity 88% and specificity 92.5% for lymphangiography; accuracy was 87.9%, sensitivity 72.2% and specificity 95% for CT. In the second group CT accuracy was 94%, sensitivity 100% and specificity 91 %. Conclusions: In early stages of the disease (I-II) lymphangiography gives better results than CT; in advanced stages and relapse CT gives high accuracy. This information is useful for avoiding unnecessary surgical exploration. We retain that CT plays a role in staging cervical cancer, recognizes lymph-nodal metastases in advanced stages and in treated patients, in early stages CT is complementary to lymphangiography and needs percutaneous biopsy.",

Most of these hernias are not clinically apparent prior to the commencement of CAPD, the increased intraabdominal pressure being an important contributory cause. We have recently encountered five patients on CAPD with inguinal hernias. Because of the considerable edema due to leakage of dialysis fluid associated with hernias, it is often diflicult or impossible to lateralize the side of the hernial sac, necessitating bilateral inguinal exploration. We describe a method of lateralizing the sides of origin of hernias by the simple procedure of adding technetium 99m-labelled DTPA to the dialysis fluid, and imaging over the groin area with the patient in the erect position. Representative images are demonstrated. Recently we have also demonstrated a leakage of dialysis fluid into the thorax causing recurrent effusion.

Methods and Materials: Retrograde urethral sonography was performed after the instillation of 6 cc. of sterile saline within the distal portion of the penile urethra, with the aid of a 7.5 MHz linear array transducer, that is applied over the penis. Voiding urethral sonography was also performed while the patient was voiding.

Sadik Bilgic;:, GOlden $ahin, Cemil Yagci, Meral Dogan, Neval Duman, BOlent Erbay, Uluhan Bark; Ankara Purpose: Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty has been used with success in the management of renovascular hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of renal angioplasty in the treatment of renal transplant arterial stenoses. Methods and Materials: Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty was performed in six renal transplant recipients aged 15-44 years. A contralateral femoral approach was selected in all patients. 4-5 F Balloon Angioplasty catheters (Schneider and Medi. tech.) 20 to 40 mm in length and 4 to 6 mm in diameter were used for dilatation. The patients were referred to angiography because of sudden onset of hypertension and/or signs of chronic rejection after renal transplantation. Significant renal artery stenosis (more than 50% of the original diameter) were determined on angiography. Transluminal angioplasty was attempted in the same session in three, and a week later in the remainder. Time for angioplasty was 2 to 24 months following transplantation. Results: Technical and early success were achieved in all patients. The stenotic segment was dilated up to 70 to 90% of original artery size. Restenosis occurred in one patient within three months and a second angioplasty was performed. No complications developed due to the procedure. Despite technical and early success, nephrectomy was performed in two patients with persisting chronic rejection signs and two patients underwent regular dialysis program for the same reasons developed in 2 to 6 months following the angioplasty. One patient remained symptomless for 10 months after the procedure. Transluminal renal angioplasty remains an alternative in the management of renal transplant arterial stenoses despite the relatively high late failure rates in this series. Results: All the procedures were successfully performed. CT ensured optimal choice of percutaneous access in every case, while fluoroscopy monitored all phases in real time; something no other imaging modality can do. The whole procedure was performed on the CT scanner table, operators' exposure to radiation was low. CTF increased the precision and speed of the maneuvers. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of M R imaging in the evaluation of bladder invasion of malignant pelvic tumor. Methods and Materials: Seventy-six patients, including rectal and sigmoid colon cancer (n = 22), uterine cancer (n = 25), malignant ovarian tumor (n = 28), and prostatic cancer (n = I) were studied. Imaging was performed at 0.5 T Toshiba unit using TI and T2 weighted spin echo sequences. Sagittal plane was obtained and coronal plane was added when necessary. Each image was studied as for intensity of the bladder wall, deformity of the bladder and existence of fat plane between the bladder and the tumor. Results: Bladder invasions were proved surgically in eighteen patients and MR imaging correctly identified 17 of these cases. These cases had deformity of the bladder and only I case showed abnormal intensity of the bladder wall. There were 8 false positive cases and these cases had relatively dilatated and thin wall bladder. Conclusions: MR imaging is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of the bladder invasion.

Various dilatation techniques, internal urethrotomy or open urethroplasty techniques may partly resolve this disappointing problem. We are presenting a new, self-expanding and self-retaining stent made of medical grade stainless steel alloy (Urocoil<lll). This stent was used in 55 patients who had recurrent strictures of various etiologies (traumatic, inflammatory or iatrogenic) and varying lengths (0.5-8.0 cm) along the urethra, from the external sphincter to the urethral meatus. The stent was inserted, under topical anesthesy of the urethra in reduced caliber under fluoroscopy after an adequate dilatation was made either by balloon dilatation or internal urethrotomy. This stent when released from its introducer to reach its maximal caliber (26/32 F) by radial self-expansion. The stents were left in the urethra up to 14 months and they could be removed without surgery. Mean follow-up is 14 months (range 3-24 months). All patients voided well and were continent after insertion of the stent. Distal migration occurred in 5 patients and repositioning was performed under fluoroscopy. During the followup period of6-16 months (mean II months) after removal of the stent 88% of the patients remained free of recurrent stricture. In failed cases a new stent was inserted. No tissue ingrowth or stone formation was observed during the followup period in the stents. This temporary stent which can be easily inserted as well as easily removed anytime is a very promising tool for the non-surgical treatment of recurring urethral stricture.",

Long-term catheterization is needed when patients are poor operative risk permanently or are recuperating after a cardiorespiratory or circulatory ailment waiting to become eligible for surgery. Despite the well known complications of long-term catheterization. the lack of an established non-surgical alternative for overcoming bladder outled obstructions leaves this manipulation as a widely used palliative treatment.

Jori; Tarragona Bone lesions in sarcoidosis are uncommon, and often their appears in chronic stage. Characteristically lesions are osteolytic without evidence of marginal sclerosis or periostal reaction and skull involvement are the rarest manifestations. We report a case of skull sarcoidosis: a 54 year old woman was diagnosticated pulmonar sarcoidosis in 1989. In March 1990 she noted headache. lymph nodes in lateral cervical region and subcutaneous nodul in right front-parietal region. Skull radiographs and CT showed numerous erosive lesions of varying size in the calvarium and in jaw. A Ga and Tc99 scan showed numerous areas of increased uptake. The interest of this case is to present iconography about skull sarcoidosis and the resolution with steroid treatment. The prognosis of bone lesions has been changed in the last ten years. result to the new techniques for bone tumors management. The radiologist's role now is the characterization of bone lesions, founding the extension, aggressivity and histological type. We have been studying 120 solitary bone lesions. with X Ray plain film, CT and MR. The sensibility for to establish the limits were different. The index for MR are 95% while the CT are 55% and X Ray plain film 27%. In the determination of the aggressivity the differences were less. The index is around 92% in all techniques. The new techniques don't provide new semiological information. For finding the histological type the CTwas superior, with 36% of index, while the X Ray plain film are 22% and the MR 29%. In the characterization of bone lesions the X Ray plain film has an important mission. although the correct treatment needs also to know the real extension. The new techniques give us this information. Purpose: Cervical spine involvement is frequent in rheumatoid arthritis (R.A.), but it is difficult to appreciate joint lesions except with roetgenograms. It is known that Gadolinium DOTA (Gd-DOTA) IV administration is taken up by inflamed synovium and we report the study with MRI and Gd-DOTA of 12 patients with cervical spine arthritis in R.A. Methods: The 12 patients had clussical of definite RA according to the ACR criteria. examined at our center in the years 1989 and 1990. All patients had clinical symptoms of cervical spine involvement (pain, stiffness, medullary or other neurological compressions). Plain radiographs are always performed (normal findings, erosions, subluxation, diastasis of CI-C2. inflammatory spondylodiscitis). MRI is realized on 0,5 Tesla Magniscan with a cervical coil in all patients: TI weighted sequences before and after Gd-DOTA; T2 weighted sequences in sagittal and axial planes. Results: MRI with Gd-DOTA IV administration seems very helpful in cervical spine of RA and allows better findings than T2 weighted sequences.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of diagnostic imaging in detecting popliteal masses in hemodialysis patients. By means of ultrasonography (US), popliteal cysts have been demonstrated in 12 (bilateral in 9) out of 37 patients (32.4%) dialyzed for more than 60 months (range 60-225, mean 122 \u00b1 48). In the 3 patients who were investigated by CT, cysts could be demonstrated to communicate with the joint cavity (Baker's cysts). In I case, immunocytochemical analysis showed diffuse 112Microglobulin-amyloid deposition within the synovial wall of the surgically removed cyst. The 8 patients with largest cysts (medium size> 20 mm) suffered some of the major features of ORA: carpal tunnel syndrome (7 cases), destructive arthropathy (5 cases), shoulder and carpal cystic radiolucencies (6 and 5 cases). In I patient, in association to Baker's cyst, MR showed two small extraarticular, subcutaneous masses (probably amyloid-tumors). These findings document the high prevalence of popliteal masses among chronic hemodialysis patients, often associated to ORA; the importance of US to detect popliteal masses must be stressed. Many long-time (> 60 months) hemodialysis patients develop a severe osteoarticular disease, termed \"dialysis arthropathy\", which is characterized by the deposition in bone and synovia of a new type of amyloid composed predominantly ofj32-microglobulin. In the present study, 45 patients (25 males, 20 females; age 56.7 \u00b1 12.6 years), undergoing chronic hemodialysis for 60-225 months (mean 115 \u00b1 49), were screened for dialysis arthropathy by means of clinical examination and radiological investigations (standard radiography and computed tomography). Twenty\u00b7four patients (53.3%) had radiographic evidence of dialysis arthropathy: geodes (shoulder 18 cases; wrist, 18; hips, 6; and knees, 2) and/or destructive arthropathies (cervical spine, 15 cases; dorsolumbar spine, 2; hands, 2; and hips, I). Within 24 months, these lesions were found to progress slowly in the majority of cases. Patients with dialysis arthropathy had been maintained on hemodialysis for longer periods of time than these without it (p < 0.001), and showed a significantly higher incidence of both carpal tunnel syndrome (p < 0.0005) and shoulder pain (p < 0.01).",

Methods and Materials: From June 1989 to February 1991 more than 150 exams of the knee have been performed with a 0.064 T unit (TOSHIBA ACCESS), having obtained with 3D partial flip angle (3dPF) sequences excellent results in term of quality of imaging and diagnostic capability. To prove these impressions we have decided to perform a double blinded prospective study based on 50 consecutive patients examinated both with MRI and arthroscopy. With MRI we are using the following imaging parameters: -Coronal 3dPF (TR 68ms, Te 24ms. FA45. 16 4.S mm slices in 4'25\") -Sagittal 3dPF (TR 68ms. TE 24ms.

The radiologic features are soft tissue swelling, periostitis with bone expansion and cortical destruction, diffuse uniform infiltration and localized osteitis. A positive chest radiograph for tuberculosis is more common in children than in adults. We report a case of a 24 year old woman who had been treated of pulmonar tuberculosis several years ago. She was admitted at our hospital and diagnosticated of miliary tuberculosis. Physical examination revealed circumscribed swelling over the palm of the right hand discharging purulent material. Roentgenograms showed localized osteitis of the distal phalanx of the third and fourth finger of the right hand. Chest radiograph was positive for tuberculosis. Cultures from the draining material of the hand and from bronchial secretions grew Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. The patient underwent a combined medical and surgical treatment and had a good evolution. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of ultrasound in the evaluation of suspected subcutaneous lipoma. Methods: 21 patients were prospectively evaluated with an Acuson 128 computed tomography unit equipped with a 5 M Hz transducer. The following parameters were studied: the size, the margins, the echogenicity towards the surrounding fatty tissue and the presence of distal sound enhancement or acoustic shadowing. MRI was performed in 4 patients with large masses with ill-defined margins. Surgery and pathological examination were performed in all patients. Results: The histological diagnosis included I epidermoid cyst, I liposarcoma and 19 benign lipomas. The patients have been classified in 3 different groups on the basis of sonographic features. The first group includes the 4 patients who underwent MRI: at ultrasound, all had large heterogeneous tumor with posterior acoustic shadowing or ill-defined margins. MRI demonstrated typical lipoma in 3 cases as proven by the pathological examination. The last case did not exhibit a lipoma pattern on MRI and corresponded to the liposarcoma. The second group included 3 patients wiht hyperechoic small subcutaneous tumors. All were confirmed to be lipomas. The last group included 14 patients with hypoechoic heterogeneous well-defined masses. 6 masses had distal acoustic enhancement, 5 were proven lipomas and one an epidermoid cyst that was indistinguishable from the other masses on the basis of sonographic criteria. The other 8 masses exhibited no acoustic enhancement and were all proven to be lipomas. Conclusions: Ultrasound is a useful method in the evaluation of small subcutaneous lipomas. For large masses, especially when the margins are ill-defined, ultrasound cannot make the differential diagnosis with other soft tissue tumors and MRI may be helpful. An avulsion fracture is a failure of bone resulting from the application of tensile force through a musculoskeletal unit or a ligament the weakness is commonly a reflection of the young unfused apophysis or a weak osteopenic bone of any cause. The panel attempt to study the different radiographic manifestations of these injuries helps the physician to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and leads to prompt and appropriate treatment for the patient. Understanding the mechanisms of injury knowledge of the specific tendons or ligaments involved. To show the many normal variants, commonly presents in the ossification center, same localizations this type of fractures, waking easy the differential diagnosis. Methods and Materials: We review all the avulsion diagnosed in 150.000 traumatic injuries attended in our Hospital between March 1983 and June 1990. We show a broad spectrum of avulsion fractures of the skeletal system. Some of then very incommon showing in some cases the radiological outcome and the normal variants that can lead to diagnostic errors. Our purpose was to describe a cystic form of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Patients were selected with peri-articular intraosseous cysts, without erosions, at their radiographs. The radiographs and medical histories were reviewed. Results: We found a cystic form of RA in 9% of 220 consecutive patients with RA. The mean follow-up time was 10 (1-39) years. The cysts were distributed symmetrically, often located at the proximal side of the joints and predominantly found around the PIP, MCP, and wrist joints of the hands, and the IP-I and MTP joints of the feel. CT showed a peripheral intraosseous cyst localisation. MRI showed that the cysts may contain fluid, inflamed synovia, or both. Radiological and clinical progression, during the course of the cystic RA, was far less compared to classic RA. Conclusions: -Cysts can be an important diagnostic feature, and a supplement to the ARA-criteria, in the diagnosis of RA.",

The purpose of this study was to compare traction-compression (I.c.) method with flexion-extension (f.e.) method for detection of segmental instability. Methods and Materials: F.e. and t.c. radiographs of 306 patients with clinically suspected lumbar spinal instability were analysed. The mean age of the patients was 43 years. In f.e. and I.c. films 4 mm or more forward/backward displacement and in f.e. films also excessive angular motion or signs of axial rotation of individual motion segments revealed instability. The chi-square test and statistic kappa were used as statistic method. Results: Up to 92 % (87/94) of the instability findings could be seen only on f.e. films, while 3% (3/94) of the instability cases could be diagnosed only on the I.e. films. In 4% (4/94) of the instability cases, signs of instability could be seen with both methods. For diagnosis of inst<lbility f.e. and I.c. tilms were not significantly interrelated, intertechnique agreement by statistic kappa remained fair. The usefulness of t.c. films in diagnosis of lumbar spinal instability is evidently very limited.",

Purpose: To study the influence of a cyclically changing stress on lumbar spine stability. Methods: Seven isolated lumbar vertebrae and 17 motion segments consisting of two adjacent lumbar vertebrae connected by their intervertebral disc were subjected to various modes of compression in vitro, thus simulating a narrow spectrum of everyday stresses on the lumbar spine. Magnification radiography and bone densitometry were done before and after testing. Preparations were halved sagitally and examined histologically for morphology of possibly present fractures. Stress testing consisted of I kN preload for I hour with a first cycle of 80 ms, I kN impulses and then a second cycle of 80 ms, 2 kN impulses superimposed. Dynamic stiffness was determined by sinusoidal 0.5 kN impulses at 12.5 Hz superimposed on a I kN preload. Results: The static deformation of an isolated vertebra after the first cycle was 70% of that experienced by a motion segment, after the second cycle there was no significant difference. Dynamic deformation of an isolated vertebra was only 45 % compared to a motion segment. Half of the preparations (417, 10/17) showed microfractures in their bony end plate. Conclusions: I. Static measurements do not sufficiently demonstrate the amount of deformity of a motion segment. 2. In a motion segment the disc is responsible to 55% for the elastic behaviour. 3. Elasticity loss of the disc results in a higher risk for vertebral microfractures.",

Genant; San Francisco, CA Purpose: Conventional radiography is limited in delineating inflammatory soft-tissue changes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated the use of unenhanced and gadopentetate-dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) enhanced MR imaging in 15 RA patients with wrist involvement. Methods: AP-, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the wrist were obtained in all patients. MR imaging was performed before and after i.v. administration of 0.1 mmollkg body weight Gd-DTPA (Magnevist\"', Schering, Berlin) (Precontrast: spinecho, TR = 600 msec, TE = 20 msec, T2-WI: gradient-echo, TR = 500msec, TE = 15 msec, 9 -30\u00b0; postcontrast: spinecho, TR = 600 msec, TE = 20msec). Results: MR imaging demonstrated twice as many erosions in the carpal and metacarpal bones than conventional radiography. In contrast to conventional radiography, MR imaging efforded direct delineation of inflammatory soft-tissue changes. In 4 patients, granulation tissue was demonstrated that infiltrated the sheath of the flexor tendons. Radiocarpal subluxation due to destruction of the radio-scaphoid-Iunate ligament was observed in 3 patients. In these patients, M R imaging demonstrated an erosion in the distal radius that was filled with markedly enhancing granulation tissue which extended 1-3 cm from the articular surface into the marrow. The erosive granulation tissue was thought to have caused the ligamentous destruction initially. Conclusions: MR imaging is unique in assessing inflammatory soft-tissue changes related to RA and may be used to recognize and prevent potential complications of RA such as tendon rupture or radiocarpal subluxation. Results: Radiological findings consisted of round and oval spots of increased density situated in the metaphyseal and epiphyseal areas of the shoulders and pelvis. The CT showed round and oval dense and homogeneous lesions grouped particularly in the femoral neck along lines of stress. Moreover lesions in the pelvis not seen on the X-ray were identified. The MRI showed the lesions as oval areas of low signal intensity on TI and T2 weighted images. Conclusions: The distribution of the lesions, the associated skin lesions, the radiographic appearances and those of the CT and MRI typical of multiple bone islands ruled out the diagnosis of metastasis and osseous dysplasias.",

Bigot: Paris AIM: To examine the appearance of stress fractures of the sacrum by CT scan. Methods: 7 cases of stress fractures reviewed retrospectively. Results: Two appearances were seen: interruption of the cortical bone of the lateral parts of the sacrum with discrete overriding of fragments, and linear areas of sclerosis either with or without clear images inside corresponding to the fracture. The diagnostic in 3 cases had been suspected clinically and on bone scan but never visualised on plain films. Conclusions: CT scan is the sole method to date capable of showing sacral fractures. This ability is however dependant on technique, requiring a detailed examination centred on the sacrum. Methods: The knee was involved in 2 cases and the elbow in one. TI and T2 weighted images were obtained at 1,5 Tesla with intravenous Gadolinium GTPA in I case. Results: The diagnosis was indicated in the 3 cases because of intra-and extraarticular soft-tissue masses containing low signal intensity masses at TI and T2 weighted images. The subchondral lytic lesions showed a low signal intensity TI and high signal intensity T2. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all cases. Surgery consisted of synovectomy in 2 cases and knee arthroplasty in I case. The low signal images in the sequences were explained by the presence of haemosiderin.

Asymmetrical weight distribution plays a very important role in the development of scoliosis because. acting on relatively fixed anatomical structures (discs, sacrum and developing vertebrae), causes asymmetrical narrowing of the disc space between L4-LS and LS-S I, asymmetrical lowering of the sacrum and axial asymmetry of L4 and L5. Such alterations, modifying the orientation of the resting surface of the sacrum and basal vertebrae, may cause spine deviations on the frontal plane. If it has been established between scoliotic deviation due to dysmetria and the lateral deviation due to asymmetrical weight distribution an acting synergism or a functional compensation, there will be respectively a progress or a reduction of the curve. Lasting the dysmetria, curves, initially mobile (para morphism), may increase and later be fixed (dysmorphism). Percutaneous needle biopsy of bone has become an alternative to the open biopsy for the diagnosis of bone lesions. It is a safe and quick procedure with satisfactory results. The mayor indication for this technique is suspected metastatic disease. Percutaneous needle biopsy can also be performed in almost any bone lesion (inflammatory or infectious disease, tumors or pseudotumors). We use two kinds of needles: aspiration type needles (18 to 22-gauge) which are more useful in biopsy of soft tissue areas of the lesion and in lytic lesions. The second type are trephine needles (12 to I 7-gauge) which can cut the bone itself. To the date, we have performed 37 C.T. guided percutaneous needle biopsies (metastatic disease (16), osteomyelitis, arthritis, hydatid cyst disease, chondrosarcoma, giant cell tumor, myeloma, histiocytosis X, Ewing sarcoma and lymphoma). In this exhibit we show the different techniques for percutaneous needle biopsy of bone in the different lesions and the results that we have had in our Service. Purpose: This work tries to contribute to the consolidation of the recently obtained role of the US in the evaluation of the Musculoskeletal System pathology. With this purpose we describe the sonographic semiology of the inflammatory, traumatologic and tumoral pathology of the Musculoskeletal System. Methods and Materials: We present selected images performed with real-time scanners using 5 MHz sector, 7'5 and 10 MHz trapezoidal and 7'Slinear transducers. We mainly study pathology of the periarticular structures of the shoulder, knee and ankle. We also include some descriptions of lesions such as tumors, injuries, inflammations and surgical sequels involving the muscles, tendons, subcutaneous tissue and bone which were examined in different anatomical regions. Results: We think that Sonography demonstrates that it can be a reliable tool for the diagnosis and evolutive evaluation of the Musculoskeletal System pathology. Besides, the advantages of its inocuity and easy availability can make of this technique the first diagnostic examination to consider in certain cases. has been used to exclude erosive osteoarthritis in distinction from psoriatic arthritis. However, previous studies have not controlled observer bias. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of bare area and subchondral erosions in the hands of patients with psoriatic arthritis and erosive osteoarthritis with control of observer bias. Methods and Materials: We performed a double blind retrospective study separately evaluating 690 interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints in 23 patients with psoriatic arthritis or erosive osteoarthritis. Classic definitions of bare area and subchondral erosions were used. An additional category of combined erosions was developed to reduce ambiguity. Results: This exhibit demonstrates that bare area erosions constitute 12 percent of erosions in erosive osteoarthritis and were identified in all patients. Subchondral erosions were seen in both disorders but were more numerous in erosive osteoarthritis. We conclude that bare area erosions are frequent in erosive osteoarthritis. The ability to distinguish psoriatic arthritis from erosive osteoarthritis lies in the relative predominance of erosion location.",

Abnormal radiographic alterations of bone graft failure from infection, fracture, nonunion and graft rejection are also stressed. The utilization of multiple modalities including conventional radiography and tomography, scintigraphy, CT and MR imaging are illustrated. Results: Knowledge of the radiographic techniques available and their appropriate application as well as an awareness of the roentgenographic appearance is imperative to evaluate osseous implants. This exhibit illustrates these features with conventional radiography as the foundation upon which diagnostic imaging is based. Indeed, radiographic assessment often provides the initial information of successful bone grafting procedures.

Bramble, Solomon Batnitzky; Kansas City, KS Purpose: Numerous pathologic conditions involve the sacroiliac joint and symptoms from these various abnormalities may be indistinguishable from mechanical causes of low back pain. Consequently radiologic assessment plays a major role in evaluation. This exhibit illustrates the radiographic appearances of these disorders in and about the sacroiliac joint. Methods and Materials: This exhibit will present the wide spectrum of pathology that involves the sacroiliac joint including the spondyloarthropathies, other arthritides, pyogenic arthritis, trauma, and secondary neoplastic extension. We will demonstrate and contrast the utilization of multiple modalities (conventional radiography and tomography, CT, MR imaging, and scintigraphy) in investigation of this interesting articulation. Results: Conventional radiography remains the primary screening modality for disease about the sacroiliac joint. Unfortunately the complex anatomy of the sacroiliac joint frequently makes interpretation of conventional radiographs difficult and findings are often initially subtle. CT and M R imaging are however, becoming increasingly important because of their high sensitivity enabling earlier detection of disease and their ability to accurately evaluate soft tissues in and around the sacroiliac joint. Purpose: Computed Radiography (CR) is a relatively new digital radiographic technique employing a photostimulable phosphor as the x-ray detector and is an evolution of conventional analogue radiography. This exhibit demonstrates our experience utilizing a 2K x 2K x 10 bit phosphor plate CR system for musculoskeletal examinations. Methods and Materials: This exhibit illustrates a wide spectrum of musculoskeletal applications (portables, spine series, scoliosis, pelvis, and extremities) and pathology using CR. Use of an interactive workstation and advantages and disadvantages of computed radiography technology are also demonstrated. An observer performance investigation comparing conventional radiographs to phosphor plate images was performed on 100 skeletal examinations with various levels of dose reduction. Results: The observer performance study suggests that the spatial and contrast resolution of our phosphor plate system is adequate for the vast majority of clinical applications in musculoskeletal imaging. Exposure dose reduction of 30-50% is possible without loss of diagnostic accuracy and the interactive workstation provides an effective method to modify display parameters and salvage improperly obtained images. We conclude that the 2K x 2K x 10bit CR phosphor plate system is an alternative to conventional film-screen images in evaluation of the musculoskeletal system without significant differences in diagnostic quality.",

Results: In all the patients, T2-weighted axial images demonstrated star-shaped decreased intensity lesion within increased intensity mass lesion. T2-weighted coronal and sagittal images clearly delineated longitudinally extension of the mass with decreased intensity area sandwiched between increased intensity areas. Correlation with histology revealed central decreased intensity area was dense fibrous tissue and peripheral increased intensity area was inflammatory granulomas. Gallium imaging study demonstrated increased uptake along longitudinally extended lesion, however, the detectability was lower than that of MR. CT showed poor tissue-contrast between mass and normal tissues. Angiography performed for a large sarcoid nodule showed non-specific hypervascular pattern.

This technique is not very well known even within the radiology specialists. We have edited a videotape intended to teach a systematic study of the shoulder joint by ultrasound, with normal anatomy, ultrasound and pathology correlation. In a step by step method the technique and the most usual pathologies are depicted. (Fluid collections, calcifications, tendinitis, tendon rupture, rotator cuff tears). The video includes cadaver dissection, animation schemas, and real-time video from normal volunteers and patients. The studies have been performed with 2 linear (5 MHz) transducers, with and without ultrasound pads. Methods and Materials: A total of 20 hemophiliac males and I female with Von Willebrand disease, aged between 12 to 70 years (mean 30), were followed in our hospital for a ten years period. All patients had osteoarticular complications, with a total of 60 joints affected. 15 had severe factor deficiency, and 6 had moderate deficiency. At initial presentation, 2 patients with moderate factor deficiency had a pseudotumor. One was intraosseous and developed without previous injury. All patients were studied with conventional radiography and those with pseudotumor were referred for scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. Results: The affected joints were: knee (17), ankle (16), elbow (16), hip (2), others (9). The main radiological findings were: erosions of joint margins (50), narrowing of joint space (48), sclerosis and osteophytoses (39), enlarged epiphysis (33), osteoporosis (22), and intraarticular effusion (II). Regarding patients with pseudotumor, the involved bone were: the radius and the femur. CT was able to detect blood density within the pseudotumor (HU: 77) and with MR many different combinations of signal intensities on TIand T2-weighted images were observed.

Therapeutic embolization was undertaken in 10 patients with aneurysmal bone cyst, I patient with giant cell tumor, 3 patients with intraosseous hemangioma and 2 patients with solitary metastasis from thyroid gland follicular carcinoma. Angiography to evaluate tumor process was performed prior to embolization, while embolization was done during the same session or later. Therapeutic embolization was performed with )valon, Marbagelan particles and Gianturco coils. The postembolization period was characterised by complete or marked pain relief in all cases. Also, all patients experienced subjective improvement as well as decrease in size of tumors. Patients whose follow-up was longer than 12 months had objective evidence of sclerosis and bone recalcification. There were no complications during therapeutic embolization procedure.",

We want to show that computed tomography offers an easy and reliable method for determining acetabular cup position. A phantom was constructed that allows positioning a metal ring corresponding to the rim wire of the socket in various combinations of lateral opening and version. On CT images this ring is represented by two points, which are well characterized by the coordinates x, y and z. After determination of those coordinates angles can be calculated. Conventional radiographs and CT images were reviewed in 50 patients, who had been examined because of suspicion of prosthesis loosening, with regard to the possibility of determining acetabular cup orientation. There was good correlation between the true and calculated angles in computed tomography and we could easily distinguish between ante-and retroversion. which is virtually impossible on a single radiograph. A method of metal artifact reduction makes possible routine employment of computed tomography even in diagnosis of metallic implants.

Our purpose is to compare the imaging of the different methods. For each technique we selected 15 patients affected by subacromial disease in order to delineate advantages, disadvantages and usefulness of each imaging technique. The results were correlated with surgical findings or clinical follow\u00b7up. On the basis of this study, our opinion is that each imaging technique we tested keeps its own indications in the evaluation of the subacromial disorders and no one of them is of absolute value.",

Methods and Materials: 39 patients underwent a V.S.P. from October 1988 to August 1990. 31 patients (25 Steffee and 6 Luque devices) were included in the study by means of the following sequence: plain AP and lateral films, 60 degrees oblique projections and C.T. scan series through the pedicles and vertebral bodies. Correct pedicular and vertebral cortex images were obtained in all patients, permitting the radiographic evaluation of success and failure in these techniques. C. T. metal artifact was diminished performing oblique transpedicular scans. Results: I J3 pedicles and 57 vertebral bodies were evaluated obtaining the following results: Purpose: To describe four new cases of pustulotic arthro\u00b7osteitis seen in our hospital between 1984-1990, emphasizing CT findings. Methods and Materials: All patients fulfilled palmoplantar pustulosis and/or swelling and tenderness on anterior chest wall with or without lumbosacral pain. Other conditions as traumatic, tumoral, infectious and HlA-B27 diseases were ex c1uded by means of a clinical questionnaire, a radiological study and laboratory tests. All patients were ellamined by CT scan performing contiguous scans (slice thickness 2.5 mm, slice increment 2-2.5 mm) with angulation of the gantry to a position perpendicular to the manubrium. Multiplanar CT images were obtained. Results: 2 patients (50%) were female and 2 (50%) male, mean age 42.2 (range 32-53). All patients were having anterior chest pain, half of them palmoplantar pustulosis and 3 (75%) lower back pain. B27 was negative in all patients and pathological studies showed chronic inespecifical inflammation. Hyperostosis, sclerosis and erosions over manubrium and first chondroesternal joints were the CT hallmarks in all patients. Furthermore, i1ial or sacral sclerosis always unilateral without narrowing of the joint space was seen in 3 (75%) patients. A sclerotic (ivory) vertebra was seen in one (25%) patient. Purpose: In a patient with arterial occlusive disease, dynamic CT was performed in order to exclude abdominal abscess after an aorto-bifemoral bypass operation. Patients and methods: A 59-year-old patient developed after an aortobifemoral bypass operation an acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis requiring hemodialysis. In addition to a myoglobinuria and increased levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine, serum creatine kinase was shown to be elevated immediately after the operation up to 81600 UII. Because of continuous fever, dynamic CT (Somatom Plus, Siemens, 100 ml Ultravist 370) was performed to exclude abdominal abscess. Results: In CT, no abdominal abscess was demonstrated. In contrast to preoperative CT, the muscles of the back and the gluteal region showed an irregular inhomogenous contrast enhancement as a correlate of rhabdomyolysis. This case was compared to other data already published.",

Computerised tomography scans in the horizontal and sagittal plaines of 22 \"antepositioned\" hips from 22 children operated on because of CDH were studied. Among those, 15 hips from children aged between 2 y 2 m and 8 y 3 m were primarily operated at our Clinic by open reduction with subtrochanteric varus derotation osteotomy with shortening of the femur and transiliac osteotomy described by Dega. There were 7 hips from children aged between I y and 2 y 6 m operated primarily at other hospitals where similar operative treatment was attempted. An evaluation of CT scans and clinical examination combined, made possible to differentiate homogeneous clinical appearance of so called femoral head anteposition and establish its one or several coexisting reasons: anterior dislocation of the hip, coxa magna after avascular necrosis, gluteal muscles fibrosis and periarticular ossifications. Purpose: To determine whether it was possible to distinguish between synovial fluid and inflammatory pannus by MRI with contrast enhancement, we evaluated patients with known rheumatoid arthritis. Methods and Materials: Fourteen patients (14 joints) with known rheumatoid arthritis were imaged with a 1.5 T M R system with surface coil. The scans were obtained in the coronal and sagittal planes with TI-weighted and T2-weighted images. Gd-enhanced TI-weighted images were also obtained. Results: Ten patients with symptom of pain and/or swelling of the knee showed collection of low signal intensity about the knee joint on precontrast TI-weighted images, and high signal intensity in the same area on T2-weighted images. Only Gd\u00b7enhanced TI-weighted images could make a differentiation between the pannus formation and the fluid as inhomogeneous enhancement and without enhancement respectively.",

We observed important accumulation of radioactivity in primary and secondary lesions in 11 patients with various benign and malignant soft tissue tumors. 2 patients with abdominal occult abscess surgically determined were slightly imaged. Tumors were relatively visualized already after I hr but the uptake was more intense at 2 hr. The targetto-nontarget ratios at 2 hr varies from 1.8 to 2.5. Biodistribution studies in mice and human showed that renal uptake was minute. It is concluded that 99mTc(v)-DMSA has a potential clinical use for the detection of soft tissue tumors.

To provide a rational basis the kinetics of non-ionic contrast media in brain metastasis of lung cancer has been studied. Methods: The kinetics of non-ionic contrast media (100 ml, 62% lopromide) after intravenous bolus administration (Flows: 40 mllmin.) in brain metastasis of bronchial carcinoma has been studied with dynamic computed tomography. The pharmacokinetic calculations and the compartiment-model analysis have been performed separately for blood, brain tissue and metastasis. Results: In normal brain tissue the kinetics of non-ionic contrast media can often be described best with a I-compartiment model (Maximum shortly after administration -monophasic decline of tissue iodine concentration). In brain metastasis the kinetics of non-ionic contrast media can frequently be described best with a 2-compartiment model (Maximum shortly after administration -biphasic decline of tissue iodine concentration). Conclusions: Non-ionic contrast media shows a different pattern of kinetics in brain metastasis compared with normal brain tissue. Considerable differences already appear in the early phase after administration. The ongoing investigation will clarify whether these differences are suitable for a rapid and sensitive detection of brain metastasis shortly after administration of non-ionic contrast media especially using modern, fast cycle CT-systems.",

In order to find out whether a certain SAH distribution -as seen on CT -corresponds to negative angiograms or not, the neuroradiological findings in 28 patients with SAH were evaluated. In all cases SAH was confirmed with CT, but the angiograms showed neither aneurysm nor angioma. In 20 cases angiography was repeated, and three patients had a third angiographic study (with re-angiography, an aneurysm was ascertained in two patients). I n most cases CT showed but a small amount of blood within the prepontine andlor the interpeduncular cistern, whereas hemorrhage in one or both Sylvian fissures was found in four cases only. Nearly all patients with prepontine or interpe-duncular SAH fully recovered. Patients with other SAH distribution had hypertension and lor angiographic findings pointing to arteriosclerosis. Based on our study, it is suggested that SAH confined to the prepontine or to the interpeduncular cistern may be rather seldom caused by an aneurysm. Hence, if CT shows such a pattern of SAH and the angiograms are negative, the question is raised, whether or not a second angiographic study should be carried out.",

Purpose: We have revised 194 patients with AIDS and neurologic complications, studied by CT and MRJ. 35 of these patients were diagnosed ofCMTB by CSF Ziehl staining or culture. This incidence is higher than the ones published in other series. Our purpose is to investigate if there exists some difference in the radiological findings in CT or MRI between patients with AIDS and non-immunosuppressed patients. Methods and Materials: We have performed CT in all patients, with i. v. contrast (iohexol), and MRI in three of them, following i.v. paramagnetic contrast injection (gadolinium DTPA). Results: We found hydrocephalus (51 % of the patients), meningeal enhancement (48%), parenchymatous lesions (34%) and vascular complications (23%). Imaging studies were normal in 23% of the patients. We have not found significant differences between AIDS and non-AIDS patients. The more frequent CT feature was non-obstructive hydrocephalus associated in 70% of the cases to meningeal enhancement. This finding is opposed to the one reported by other authors. This justified the absence of meningeal enhancement by a supposed lower immunedefense capability in AIDS patients. Finally, MRI has been very useful in showing meningeal enhancement in three patients with normal CT studies, providing a more precocious diagnosis and proper treatment.

Purpose: The purpose of this research work is to analyse the application of \"now-colour\" images as an addition to the cerebral angiography study in different pathologic processes.

The purpose of our study was to identify the criteria that permit a correct differential diagnosis between mal formative and acquired pathologies. We included in the study 61 subjects correlated by MR examinations in which cortical abnormalities were demonstrated. In 30 cases the pathologies were encephaloclastic. In the remaining 31 cases mal formative (7 schizencephaly. 6 polymicrogyria, 9 pachygyria, 9 neuronal heterotopia). In 15 cases there was surgical confirmation.

To verify the compensatory system efliciency and select patients for surgery, in the last two years we evaluated 127 pts with carotid occlusion by doppler continuous wave, TCD and CT; 33 pts underwent 99mTcHMPAO brain SPECT as well. The pts were divided into two groups according to the presence (group I) or not (group 2) of a CT stabilized ischemic S288 lesion. and into subgroups according to their neurological symptoms. All pts were classified on the basis ofTCD pulsatility index (PI) symmetry. Group I: agreement between PI asymmetry and SPECT hypo perfusion in all cases but for a patient with stroke (PI asymmetry, SPECT hypoperfusional area corresponding to CT lesion). Group 2:6 pts with PI symmetry showed SPECT hypoperfusional areas (2 pts had bilateral occlusion justifying PI symmetry) and 4 pts had significant TCD mean velocity asymmetry on middle cerebral artery territory. SPECT can reveal, especially when CT is negative, areas of insuflicient vascular flow not detectable using other techniques; TCD allows to identify the compensatory mechanisms and the haemodynamic situation to select patients for surgery. Results: MR did not usually enable a more specific histologic diagnosis than other imaging techniques.

Each patient received an initial injection of 0.1 mmollkg gadoteridol. followed 30 minutes later by an additional dose of 0.2 mmollkg. No clinically significant effects were noted. No significant difference in lesion contrast was noted between the images obtained immediately after the initial injection of gadoteridol and those obtained after 10 and 20 minutes. After the additional dose of gadoteridol. however, there was significant improvement in visualization (70171) Needle aspiration biopsy was done in 33 cases. Accurate diagnosis was revealed in 31 cases, hence the significance of this method was 94%. The rate of malignancy in cold solitary nodules was 22%. US and needle aspiration biopsy obtained better results especially when they were combined with the scintiscanning method. Nevertheless it should be remembered that the role of CAT is very important in malignant cases and in cases having suspicious evidence of malignancy.",

The first case appeared to be a minor salivary gland monomorphous adenoma. The second one was a squamous cell carcinoma of the epidermis, and the third one a cystic adenoid carcinoma or a minor salivary gland cilindroma. There was no defined border between the parotid gland and the mass in both cases of minor salivary gland tumor. In the other case there was a deep inliltration displacement of the pharynx fat to the inner, making impossible to separate from a parotid gland tumor. Computed tomography (CT) offers a consistently good examination for the involvement of the parapharyngeal spaces, and contributes to predict the origin of the tumor according to the displacement pattern of the bordering fatty planes. Innammatory disease of nose and paranasal sinuses is a common challenge in diagnostic imaging. Conventional radiography (RX) is mostly employed as a first step diagnosis. Alternatively a newly developed technique named computed radiography (CR) can be used: photostimulable phosphor imaging plates are employed with the following advantages: exposure dose reduction, digital conversion of x-ray image information with image processing capabilities, wide exposure and registration range. In this paper a comparison was made among RX, CR, CT and MRI in a series of 56 adult pts., using a craniostat (4 standard projections), a TCR 201 system, a high resolution CT (OM -10\u00b0 plane, 8-10 slices of 10 mm) and a 0.22 T resistive magnet (multi planar acquisition, 10-12 slices of 10 mm, TI-, PD-and T2-WI). The following aspects were considered: spatial resolution, dosimetry, time consumption, anatomical detail, costs and diagnostic outputs; a global performance index was derived (RX < I, CR -I, MRI = 2.2, CT = 7.3).",

In recent years Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brought the most sensitive diagnostic possibilities and became a gold standard in studying the paranasaI sinus abnormalities. In our study, we examined the effectiveness of Water's graphies in the detection of the acute and chronic sinus infections and had some conclusions about the conventional interpretation criterias. With this purpose 100 patients, who were diagnosed to have sinus infections on MRI were subsequently examined with Water's graphies with standard techniques. These radiographs were interpreted by five different radiologists blindly and independently. The results were correlated with MR findings and analyzed with Receive Operating Characteristics (ROC). Despite the high sensitivity of the Water's graphies, the accuracy in detection of the maxillary sinus infections was found as low as 56%. The accuracy rate for frontal and ethmoidal sinuses were even lower. Purpose: Study of the efficacy of sonography for the diagnosis of no-tumoral diseases of the salivary glands. Methods and Materials: Sonography of the parotid and/or submandibular glands was performed in 113 patients with clinical history of salivary pathology. The age of the patients ranged from 13 to 82 years. 46 were female and 67 were male. Histology, follow-up or sialography in other cases were performed as the gold standard.

Conclusions: In acute inflammation sonography helps to define abscesses, fistulas or sialectasia, but it is worse to detect chronic inflammation. Sonography is also very useful in salivary calculi in most cases, especially in concrements larger than 2-3 mm and intraglandular location. Diseases of the middle ear and mastoid can be reliably diagnosed and described by CT. Our intention is to demonstrate the high potential of CT in preoperative diagnostics of patients suffering from middle ear pathology by comparison of CT and operative findings. High resolution CT scans with I mm thick slices on SIEMENS Somatom DR were used to examine 22 adult patients. In 10 of them CT examination was followed by surgery. Clinical diagnoses ranged from suspected cholesteatoma to chronic middle ear inflammation with granulations and destruction of small ear bones. Attic cholesteatoma visible on CT scans was found in 6 patients. The smallest one occupied only the epitympani cal recessus while the largest one fulfilled the entire atticoantral space with tympanic cavity and propagated inflammatory process to the temporal cerebral lobe. Granulations were found in all cholesteatoma patients and majority of them had small ear bones destructed. One patient had isolated anvil destruction without cholesteatoma. Surgery confirmed CT visible pathology (granulations, liquid content, adhesions) in operated patients. Surgery planning was influenced by CT images in some patients, particularly in choosing appropriate approach or in prepairing reconstructive surgery for hearing improvement.",

Investigations of the struma reduction therapy with Iodine-131 have shown that an objective assessment of the result of the therapy is difficult. The goal of our study was to determine whether CT studies of these patients can provide additional information for an objective assessment of the result of the therapy. A CT study is able to image the intraluminal and extraluminal structures of the trachea non-invasively and without administration of a contrast medium. Comparability of CT measurements prior to and after radioiodine therapy is, however, impaired by the individual selection of the slices in the scout view. Even investigators with substantial expertise experience deviations of up to several millimeters when trying to reproduce the same slice. Such shifts lead to significant differences in the measurement of the tracheal lumen. For the quantification of the result of the therapy the CT study has, therefore, only limited usefulness. As a complement to the measurement of the circumferential of the neck, the determination of the thyroidal volume, and lung function studies, the CTstudy of the trachea can make a contribution to the documentation ofthe result of the therapy. It can, however, not provide any information which would be additional to a conventional radiograph of the trachea.",

In 12 patients PET studies were performed prior and after the first cycle with cisplatinum and 5-FU. Tumor and lymph node volumes were determined in CT cross sections and the growth rate was calculated. The images were analysed using a region of interest technique and the data were standardized to the injected dose and the body weight. FOG data were evaluable for 6 tumors and 8 lymph nodes, volumetric data for 5 tumors and 7 lymph nodes. All malignant lesions showed an increased FOG uptake as compared to normal muscle tissue. During therapy 50% had a decrease in FOG uptake, the rest remained unchanged or increased. Multiple lymph nodes in the same patient may show a different baseline value and also a difference in response to therapy. A high correlation between the change in FOG uptake and the growth rate was found with different regression functions for tumors and lymph nodes. These results demonstrate that early changes in tumor uptake due to therapy can be detected with PET. Radiological examinations included panoramic views. detailed images with narrow beam radiography and cross-sectional tomography. Methods: The radiographs were evaluated for bone resorption within the graft and under the plate, changes in graft size. integrity of reconstruction plate and bony union.

A male, aged 43 years, was referred for investigation following two episodes of meningitis. Neurology examination showed the patient to be lethargic. CT scan of the middle ear showed a soft tissue opacity in the right atticoantral area with evidence of a deficiency of the related tegmen. The other areas of the middle ear and mastoid air cell system suggested a chronic infection or a cholesteatoma. An MRI was performed, confirming the area of dehiscence and suggesting the presence of a small encephalocoele with a signal intensity similar to brain within the cavity. There was an abnormal inflammatory signal intensity in the adjacent mastoid air cells. On surgical exploration a soft pulsating brain mass was noted in the alticoantral region. covered with granulation tissue and thick dura mater. The intraoperative conclusion was that this was an encephalocoele occupying the alticoantral region, having prolapsed through a secondary tegmen dehiscence following a cholesteatoma.

In 60 patients with head and neck tumors, lymph nodes involvement was assessed by physical examination, CT and ultrasonography. Positive lymph nodes were detected with palpation in 26 patients (44%) and by CT and ultrasound scans in 34 (56%). Forty positive nodes were identified with S292 physical examination, 61 by CT and 10 by ultrasonography. CT and ultrasound can visualize deep metastatic nodes in the neck, difficult to discover with palpation, more over this cannot evaluate whether or not the jugular vein is truly thrombosed. Ultrasonography allows to distinguish a single enlargement in nodal masses and gives an accurate evaluation of the relations between nodes and vascular structures.

Our experiences suggest that CT is an essential method in the surgical indication of chronic sinusitis. In recent yrs an increasing interest on neck US and US guided FNA cytology in patients with DTC has been reported. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effective role of US in the follow-up of these pts, comparing US to TBS results. We considered 65 pts previously treated by total thyroidectomy for DTC and with elevated serum Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (Tg 3 nglml is considered pathologic in our laboratory for these pts). To search metastases (mts), they were studied by means of US, TBS, conventional radiology, CT scan and, in cases with lymph node (LN) Symptomatic TMJ dysfunction may affect about 25% of the adult population with a smaller, but significant percentage of patients suffering serious disability. From 1986 to 1989 102 pts with significant TMJ symptoms and with various TMJ diseases, were evaluated with conventional radiology and cJosedopen-mouth TMJ tomograms: 20 pts were submitted to CT and 5 to MR as well. SPECT and planar imaging were performed in 27 pts with a rotating gamma-camera equipped with a general purpose collimator. Transaxial, coronal, sagittal tomograms were reconstructed. TMJ increased radiotracer localization was regarded as a positive finding, and the intensity of TMJ activity was compared with that of adjacent calvarium using ROIs. Our results indicate that SPECT rather than planar imaging provides useful information for diagnostically difficult, symptomatic pts: CT although useful in assessing the TMJ structure and articular surfaces, is not always a good indicator of dysfunction: MR gives a more detailed image of soft tissue anatomy and may identity functionally significant TMJ abnormalities, but cost limits its application. Either MR or SPECT is suitable for non-invasive confirmation of the TMJ derangement clinical diagnosis, and if better joint diagnostic accuracy is desired both techniques should be employed.",

Since 1984, 78 procedures were performed in the Radiology Department of our Hospital using the percutaneous route with echographic and or radioscopic guidance. In 74 cases (94,8%) the procedure was correctly performed while in 4 cases (5,2%) this did not possible succeed: in 3 patients it wasn't possible to place the nephrostomic drain: in one patient the percutaneous dilatation of a stenotic uretherosigmoidostomy was functionally insufficient. Only in 2 cases (2,5%) there were complications (endopyelic bleeding during percutaneous nephrostomy) that resolved spontaneously. Jones; New Orleans, LA Computed radiography using photostimulable phosphor receptors allows dissociation of X-ray dose from film density. This permits diagnostic quality radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine to be obtained with doses as small als 5 to 10% of those required using conventional film screen techniques. When used for serial evaluation, this technique has the potential for significantly reducing the cumulative radiation exposure in young patients followed for observation and treatment of scoliosis. Over 1600 spine examinations in children ranging in age from 4 to 18 years have been performed using low dose techniques with computed radiography over a 5 year period. Records were reviewed to calculate the total savings in radiation burden resulting from the use of low dose techniques and the adequacy of diagnostic image quality in the serial evaluation of scoliosis. Our studies indicate that clinically useful studies can be routinely achieved at average exposure levels of less than 5% of those required for normal radiography, with significant reduction in cumulative dose to bone marrow and breast tissue in patients receiving serial examinations. Low dose computed radiography is recommended as the method of choice for serial evaluation of scoliosis in pediatric patients. ",

Nottingham. Methods: Detailed scans are usually carried out on fetuses at I g to 20 weeks gestation. A full anatomical assessment is made and in addition where possible transverse, coronal and profile views of the fetal face are obtained. All antenatal scans were reviewed as were pathological specimens and postmortem reports. Results: Facial abnormalities were seen in 20 fetuses. The most common finding was 6 cases of micrognathia and this was present in 4 out of 9 fetuses with Trisomy 18, one case of camptomelic dysplasia and one case of short rib polydactyly syndrome. The most striking appearances were seen in the 6 cases of alobar holoprosencephaly. 5 cases showed facial abnormalities ranging in severity from cyclopia with proboscis. cebocephaly. to hypothelorism, midline clefting and nasal hypoplasia. One case however demonstrated normal facial structures. Facial c1efting was present in 2 cases of Trisomy 13 and one case of Roberts Syndrome. Depression of the nasal bridge was seen in one case of thanatophoric dwarfism and typical facial appearances were seen in the S cases of anencephaly. Conclusions: We feel the visualization of the fetal face is essential in the assessment of intracranial abnormalities and in any situation where a chromosomal abnormality is suspected. It also provides additional information in the assessment of skeletal dysplasias. The poster will be presented in the form of the front page of that well known newspaper The Daily Scanner.

Eight male patients (mean age 55 \u00b1 5 years) with chronic renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/mn) undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization were enrolled in this study. Renal clearance study (inulin and PAH clearances) and enzymuria were carried out one day before and one day after loxaglate administration. The amount of contrast medium which was injected was 167 \u00b1 43 ml. None of the patients experienced any adverse reactions. All the patients had markedly depressed renal clearances values before angiography. Mean serum creatinine. glomerular filtration rate (GFR). effective renal plasma flow (EPRF) and urinary beta-2 microglobulin excretion were unaltered by angiography. Only one patient had an increase in serum creatinine of more than 10% (from 136 to 156 micromoles/l; 1.3 to 1.8 mg/dl) after the procedure with a decrease in GFR from 34 to 27 mllmn. In this patient serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate normalized within 72 hours. Purpose: To investigate the lung weights and histological changes induced by intravenous administration of ionic and nonionic contrast media in rats. Methods and Materials: A comparative study of non-treated. physiological saline, Diatrizoate, lohexol and loxaglate was carried out using male wister rats. Each contrast medium prepared in solution containing 6 g iodine per kg or corresponding volume of saline was administered at a rate of 1.5 mL per minute. Animals were necropsied 20, 60. and 120 minutes after the administration of contrast media. The lung was removed and weighed. Histological specimens were analyzed for further investigation of microscopic changes. Results: Although the lung weights were significantly increased after intravenous administration of all contrast media. no statistical significance was obtained in each material. Perivascular edema and dilatation of hilar lymph vessels were histologically confirmed in the contrast media groups. There was no statistical significance of perivascular edema gradings in each material. There were well proportional correlation between increased lung weights and perivascular edema gradings and dilatation of hilar lymph vessels gradings. The evaluation of cerebral perfusion by magnetic resonance imaging was impossible until now, because of the very long sequence acquisition time.",

In order to rule out a mechanical dilatatory effect of the CM, up to 20 cc of saline were injected prior to CM in 10 women, serving as a control group. The most important single finding observed was significant QTc prolongation in 2S (90%) out of the 28 women examined. QTc increased from 417\u00b1 18 msec to 4S1 \u00b130 msec (P<O,OOI). This effect disappeared within 2-3 minutes. QTc returning to the baseline values (414 \u00b1 18 msec). The QTc did not change significantly after saline injection (418 \u00b1 18 msec). The mechanism causing the QTc prolongation is unclear. Anxiety is obviously not the cause as QTc changed only during CM injection. Dilatation of the uterine cavity was ruled out due to the fact that saline injection did not cause the same effect.

Van Hecke (Presenter We report about a 40 year old patient who presented with febril temperature and left sided hemiparesis. In the history there was a lung resection because of tuberculosis 20 years ago. One of the diagnostic examinations was the MR-tomography of the brain. Supra-and infratentorial multiple circular lesion with central necrosis, perifocal edema and marginal contrast enhancement were seen. The histological result of the stereotactic biopsy represented a granulomatosis inflammation with central necrotic areas. There was no sign for metastasic genesis or other inflammations. Under tuberculostatic therapy there was a good regression of the radiological and clinical findings. Therefore retrospectively the diagnosis of cerebral tuberculosis is verified. This case does not agree with the well known manifestation of cerebral tuberculosis. MR-images demonstrate very clearly the exact location of the lesions and their regression after therapy. Ten patients with cystic pancreatic neoplasms, were explored on MR! after US and CT examination. Several criterias as signal intensity modifications of morphologic aspects were studied. for expose specific findings. These examinations were performed on a low field magnet in 4 ca.~es. and on a high field magnet\u00b7 in 6 cases, with transversal slices on these lesions in TI and T2 sequences. Those patients had serous cystadenomas in 3 cases, and mucinous tumors in 4 cases, but cystadenocarcinomas in 3 other cases. MRI allowed only measurements of these cysts and particularly their size, number, and also the thickness of their septas. However signal intensity, neither homogeneity of these cysts, were at all specific of a kind of tumor, or even different of some pancreatic pseudocyst. Diagnosis was essentially based on morphologic criterias well known, such as more than 6 lesions of less than 2 em for serous cystadenomas, and as less than 6 cysts of more than 2 cm for mucinous lesions. This study showed also, that signal modifications on MRI in TI and T2 sequences are not specific, and not sufficient for differentiated histologic type of cystic pancreatic tumors. Spontaneous regression of disk herniation in the lumbar spine has already been described as well as reduction or disappearance of acute back pain or sciatica after conservative treatment. None correlated on follow-up studies disk herniation evolution to clinical course of the disease. Moreover there are not series of patients followed after the radiological diagnosis of disk herniation large enough to assess a possible statistical analysis about the natural evolution of this disease. In the course of 1116 MR examinations performed in our Institution in the past three years the diagnosis of disk herniation was made in 286; out of these, 81 underwent the follow-up MR, performed 6to 15 months after the first one. A volumetric evaluation of disk herniation was performed on sagittal and axial planes. Based on the modification of the volumetric values obtained in the two MRs we classified the patients in 4 groups. The clinical evaluation was performed using a method stated by Pearce and Moll. Our data showed a high incidence of regression of herniated material (63%), a low incidence of progression (8%) and a tight correlation between morphologic and clinical findings. SPACE lID. is represented by a curve which is an estimate of the underlying physiological function, a factor image which is the associated spatial distribution and a contribution which quantifies the relative importance.

Frontal orientation results in the best overall contrast allowing the best delineation of the pulmonary trunk. Sagittal or oblique orientations are mandatory for hilar regions. Parallel travelling presaturation pulses in oblique orientation enable selective detection of pulmonary arteries and veins, whereas transverse presaturation avoids overlap of different vessels, making anatomical identification easier. An automized control procedure with instant image and individual continuation allows patient-monitoring and guarantees high quality angiograms. In MIP-postprocessing box size reduction and slice selection are used to create angiograms of interest (AOI) ensuring confident anatomical identification without overlap from neighbouring vascular structures. This technique allows display of the mediastinal vessels, the hilar arteries and veins as well as the more peripheral intrapulmonary and intercostal vascular structures.

We investigated the magnitude of the different relaxation processes such as chemical shift effects and inhomogeneous magnetic susceptibility contributing to the red-yellow marrow contrast on gradient-echo images. Methods: MR imaging (1.5 T, GE Signa) was performed in 4 patients with known hematopoietic hyperplasia of the knee. Spinecho images were acquired with TR = 600 msec and TE = 20 msec. Gradient-echo (GRE) images were obtained with TR = 250 msec and 9 = 90\u00b7 , TE was increased from 10-21 msec at I msec increments. Water-suppressed and fat-suppressed GRE images were generated with the same parameters using chemically selective presaturation pulses. Results: Red-yellow marrow contrast on out-of-phase ORE images may be related to chemical shift effects or intracellular iron in hematopoietic marrow causing inhomogeneous magnetic susceptibility and intravoxel static field variation. Signal intensities of red and yellow marrow demonstrated an oscillating pattern with increasing TE on GRE images. Red-yellow marrow contrast was minimal on in-phase images (TE = 9, 14, 18 msec); it was maximal on out-of-phase images (TE = 7, II, 16msec). When the fat or water component were suppressed, red-yellow marrow contrast was not greater on out-of-phase ORE images than on in-phase ORE or spinecho images. Conclusions: Improved red-yellow marrow contrast on out-or-phase gradient-echo M R images is primarily related to chemical shift effects resulting from the different fat and water content of hematopoietic and fatty marrow. Out-of-phase ORE imaging may be used to monitor distribution of hematopoietic marrow as a function of age and erytrocyte demand. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography was performed in ten patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome proved by polysomnography.

Methods: 12 patients with clinically small uterine cervical carcinoma have been studied with 0.5 T MRI; the surgical specimens were evaluated (FIGO criteria). Results: Pathologic examination indicated stage IA carcinoma in 5 patients and stage IB in 7 patients. MRI correctly staged 2 patients with IA cancer (40%) and 6 patients with IB disease (85.7%). 3 patients were overstaged and I patient understaged. The pathologic examination of the specimens of the patients who were overstaged showed the presence of dilated cervical glands that mimicked neoplasia in T2W sequences.

Local magnetic field inhomogeneities induced by paramagnetic contrast agents applied as a bolus lead to a transient signal loss in T2* weighted gradient echo images while the bolus is passing through the tissue. This loss of signal intensity is correlated to the regional tissue perfusion. In our prospective study 30 patients (15 with no cerebrovascular disease, 15 with vascular stenosis brain infarctions or cerebral neoplasms) were examined. The goal of our study was to examine whether this method leads to clinically relevant results concerning local brain perfusion. We have applied a series of fast T2* weighted gradient echo images (2.9 sec/image) during and after bolus application of GdDTPA. From this series of images the local changes in the signal intensity were computed pixel by pixel. From these data a perfusion image was calculated. These perfusion images show significant perfusion differences between white and grey mailer. Regions of cerebral infarctions can be clearly identified as regions with lower perfusion.

One of the main items of our development work was to achieve a user-friendly bottle with a design corresponding to the users demands. To get information about the demands we performed a marked research in France, England and Sweden. A survey of the production method, the conclusions from the market research and the results from the stability study will be presented in the poster.",

We report our experience about the use of Computerized Tomography (CT) imaging reformation programs in the clinical practice. Especially we emphasise the possibility to correct the image according to anatomical axes that is normally impossible with simple CT axial scans. We considered especially the application of continuous reformation that uses a single reference reformation image to create single or multiple reformation images along parallel planes to correct the parallelism between axial plane and intervertebral disk space in accentuated scoliosis or lumbar hyper-lordosis with optimum reconstruction of spaces and better visualization of herniated disk. The same program proved to be valuable in reconstructing from a regular axial scan sequence of the skull the complete sequence with correct inclination for tempera I lobe without excessive image degradation. We also studied the application of oblique reformation software that uses two member images to create a single or a multiple oblique image reformatted along parallel plaines. The program proved to be useful in the bronchial tree examination with better stenosis visualization and improved spatial appreciation of peri-bronchial lesions.",

The contrast and spatial resolution of digitized IOO-mm fluoroscopic radiographs displayed on a CRT were evaluated experimentally with use of a Burger phantom and a Hewlett chart. Modulation transfer function characteristics were studied to assess the quality of the CRT Image. Results: This system was used for routine mass screening of 5.000 cases for lung cancer. These 100-mm fluoroscopic radiographs of the chest from mass screening for lung cancer were digitized with a lOO-j.Lm pixel size and 12-bit gray-scale resolution. Radiologists evaluated the digitized images as displayed on a CRT. The diagnostic accuracy of this system was compared with that of conventional 100-mm fluoroscopic radiographs and was found to be better. Conclusions: The IOO-mm roll-film digitizer and the image processor are useful as a miniature picture archiving and communication system for the mass screening of patients with lung cancer.",

Aresu; Cagliari 30 patients (20 females and 10 males) between 25 and 50 years of age with hepatic and/or splenic localization of tubercular disease, were studied with ultrasonography. Previously a form of pulmonary tuberculosis had been diagnosed in these patients. All of them were subjected to CTscan: 5 to hepatic angiography and 20 to percutaneous biopsy of the liver under ultrasound guidance. In 25 subjects ultrasonography evidenced a nodular formation restricted to the liver whereas in the other 5 patients, besides at hepatic level, lesions were also present in the spleen. These formations were roundish with a diameter varying from 5 to 7 cm and presented a hyperechoic central area and a peripheral hypoechoic halo. Liver biopsy of the lesions under ultrasound guidance made it possible to evidence fact of innammatory cells and more specific epithelioid cells in caseous necrotizing areas. Ziehl coloration revealed the presence of alcohol acid resistant bacilli. Treatment was started with Ethambutol 800 mg/day, Pyridoxine 500 mg/day and INH 200mg/day and was protracted from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 10 months. Patients rapidly improved and after a period of 5 to 9 months from the beginning of treatment, the ultrasonic and tomographic values returned to normal. Our results allow us to affirm that the hepatosplenic localization of tubercular disease is all but rare and must therefore be considered in differential diagnosis of space occupying lesions, at a hepatic as well as at renal levels, in the same way as other pathologies such as neoplasia, parasitic cysts etc .. According to our data it is also possible to affirm that with adequate medical therapy the prognosis of these patients is good.",

Such tumours rarely concentrate radioiodine to an extent sufficient for therapeutic application. Astatine (At), the highest radiohalogen, though more amphoteric than iodine, exhibits some similar physio-chemical properties; it concentrates in normal thyroid tissue to a significant degree. Though the in vivo metabolism ofastatine in thyroid tissue is not entirely dissimilar from that of iodide, a precise intracellular biochemical mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. 211 At is most suited for therapeutic purposes as it decays by a-emissions of mean LET near optimal for radiotherapeutic effects. In order to exploit both its unique biochemical behaviour and nuclear properties, 211 At has been investigated as a potential S305 a-endoradiotherapeutic agent in a human thyroid tumour xenograft model in nude mice. Biodistribution and a-autoradiographic studies were carried out in euthyroid male MFI nu/nu mice, each bearing a single s.c. implanted human undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. Mice received a single i.v. injection of 370-740 kBq Na 211 At and were sacrificed at intervals over 48 h. The uptake of 211At into thyroid carcinoma xenografts was rapid, and sustained. A significant degree of 211At localization (11-28% injected dose 211At/g tumour) was achieved in 6/8 anaplastic and 2/2 undifferentiated follicular thyroid carcinomata. 211At was found to be homogeneously distributed within malignant cellular areas, with few a-tracks originating from stroma. None of these tumours concentrated radioiodine. Radiodosimetric calculations suggest that a tumoricidal high-LET quality radiation dose can be delivered to such tumours by endogeneously targeted 21 lAt.",

Wannenmacher; Heidelberg Subdiaphragmatic radiation therapy in malignant lymphomas usually include the paraaortic and parailiacal region, the splenic pedicle, the spleen and rarely the liver hilus and prominent lymphatic masses in other locations. Organs with low radiation tolerance like kidneys have to be protected. Purpose of treatment planning is to define an individual and reproductible target volume. We developed and employed a technique to visualize simultaneously abdominal organ and blood vessel anatomy in frontal view by using MRT and MRA. A computer program was created to superimpose an optimal coronar MR-Tomogram and MR-Angiogram. By using a subtraskope the MRT/MRA-superposition can exactly be projected on a simulation film in correct scale. This novel method was evaluated in 15 patients. The individual target volume could exactly be defined and thereby individual field corrections were possible. Especially significant protection of renal parenchyma was achieved. Treatment planning on simulation film using a subtraskope is simple and can be performed within a mean of 10 minutes. We assume that renal contrast examination, CT-planning and i.v.-DSA can be replaced by this method. The presented technique is an accurately non-invasive method to optimize and individualize treatment planning in subdiaphragmatic lymphomas.",

M. van Kampen; NOrnberg AIM: Our therapeutic concept in the situation oflocoregional recurrent breast cancer with macroscopical residual tumor is a combined radiation and chemotherapy to increase live quality by tumor control. Methods: 61 patients with 70 tumor areas (chestwall or/and lymphatic nodes) were treated during the last 12 years. Median follow up period was 24 months. The radiation was controlled by the rhythm of chemotherapy: 4 courses including 14 days of CMF-chemotherapy with simultaneous radiation followed by 14 days of interruption without any therapy. The overall treatment time is about 3 112 to 4 months. Results: The overall result is a 87% complete remission rate at the end of therapy and a 65% permanent local infield tumor control rate during the whole follow-up period (median 24 months). The result is depending on radiation dose. Doses higher than 60 Gy increase the complete remission rate to 93% and the permanent local tumor control rate (infield) to 86%. The rate of ipsilateral outfield recurrences is 6% and of contralateral tumors is 15%. The tolerance of this therapy is quite good. Acute side-effects (haematological, gastroenterological, degree I-II WHO) are reversible. The acute and chronical side-effects of the skin due to radiation are not more than degree I-II (EORIC). Conclusions: Considering the problems of the macroscopical persistent tumor the therapeutic control of locoregional tumor by combined radiation and chemotherapy is a reasonable treatment policy.",

In combination with IORT, postoperative external beam irradiation was applied to about half patients in doses ranging from 30 to 54 Gy (average 40 Gy). The median survival time of patients with carcinoma of the pancreas was about 12 months and those with carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system was 8 months. The actuarial survival of these patients was 50% at I year and 20% at 2 years on the former, and 37% and 24% on the latter, respectively. Patients treated by IORT in combination with postoperative irradiation survived longer than those treated by IORT alone (13 months versus 5 months median survival on carcinoma of the pancreas and I I months versus 3 months on carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary system). The treatment modality consisting of IORT plus postoperative irradiation was found to be the most important prognostic factor. After tumor resection, if possible, IORT with a dose of about 20 Gy combined with postoperative doses ranging from 40 to 48 Gy was considered to be feasible without causing severe adverse reaction.",

Since 198527 patients (22 females, 5 males, age 26-70, mean 50 \u00b1 13 years) were treated by ablative radioiodine therapy because of recurrent severe hyperthyroidism. Thyroid volume was determined by ultrasound; maximum storage and effective half-time by radioiodine test.

Post-therapy controls were performed after 3 months and thereafter in 3-6 months intervals. 3. After 3 months hyperthyroidism is eliminated in 93%. 2 patients still remained hyperthyroid without needing anti thyroidal drugs.

In conclusion achievement of local control in meningeoma appears to require whenever possible nearly complete or complete resection.

Methods: 175 consecutive patients who were referred for routine phlebography because of clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis (nVT) were also investigated with a new, simplified, computerized strain-gauge plethysmograph (Phlebotest, Eureka AB). An occlusion plethysmograph curve was obtained from each leg simultaneously. Different numerical parameters were defined and determined from curves with both fixed and variable time of cuff inflation. The parameters were correlated with the phlebographic diagnosis. Results: The diagnostic sensitivity of plethysmography with fixed inflation time was equal to that of variable inflation time. Two parameters of the outflow part of the plethysmograph curve correillted well with the phlebographic diagnosis, which proved correct in 60 patients without DVT, including 2 false negative cases, and in 36 patients with thrombosis. In 79 patients, plethysmography alone was not sufficient to establish a diagnosis.

New methods are only beneficial if they offer more information than previously obtained, or substitute other methods. The tendency in medicine has been to take up new methods in addition to other types. Methods and Materials: For the period from 1965 to 1989, the pattern of urinary tract examinations was registered retrospectively in six Norwegian hospitals: one university hospital, two central hospitals and three local hospitals. The registrations were performed by examining the hospitals' files and protocols by two radiologists. Results: Directly related to the introduction of CT in the various hospitals, the number of renal angiographies declined. The introduction of US and its almost linear increase reduced both the number of CT examinations and, more dramatically, the number of intravenous urographies (lVP). There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between the two modalities. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume, that at least in Norway, new diagnostic tools for medical imaging are substituting older modalities. (21), and cranial CT (21) were performed at presentation, and less frequently during follow-up. By January 1990,30 patients had died (complete autopsies 10 cases, partial 3). Results: Lymphadenopathy or visceral lesions were present in 29/45 (64%) cases at presentation. Visceral KS was radiologically presented as small nodules, and occasionally as larger masses. In the lung and liver, small KS nodules and tumoral bands were usually seen in a peribronchovascular (lung) or periportal (liver) location. In 1989 we changed film-screen-systems from blue to green sensitive. One goal has been to reduce radiation dose to patient without loosing image quality. Additionally we increased total filtering of the x-ray tubes from 2.5 mm AI to 4.5 mm AI.",

Histologic diagnosis was: diffuse large cell (4 cases), immunoblastic (3 cases), Burkitt (3 cases) and the other one was only reported as high grade lymphoma. 6 patients were clinically diagnosed as stage IV, 2 as IE, one as I and in the rest the clinical stage was unknown (one dead and other was lost to follow-up). 1 patients presented with B symptoms at the diagnosis time. Extranodal involvement was identified in whole series: 6 cases CNS, 6 cases liver and spleen, 5 cases bone marrow, 3 cases skin and mucoses, 2 cases pleuropulmonary and one case gastro-intestinal tract. There was nodal involvement in 2 patients. We present conventional radiologic and CT imaging and we compare with literature our results.",

Methods and Materials: Human ovarian and lung cancer cell lines which express CA 125 antigens were cultured with various concentrations of interferon-y, dexamethasone, or sodium butyrate. CAI25 release to the culture medium was measured and after 5 days exposure to drugs, cells were incubated with radiolabelled monoclonal anti-CAl25 antibody. Results: Interferon-y increased the release of CAI25 antigen and the binding of radiolabelled anti-CA 125 antibody to PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells, but decreased A549 lung adenocarcinoma and SHIN3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Dexamethasone completely suppressed the CAI25 antigen expression in three out of 9 cell lines examined at a physiological concentration. The number of antibody binding sites decreased without affecting affinity constants. On the contrary, sodium butyrate increased CAI25 expression of the same 3 cell lines more than 2-folds. Conclusions: Drugs remarkably regulated the CAI25 expression in some, but not all, cancer cell lines. These effects may be applied to improve the tumor uptake and biodistribution of radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies. Results: On unenhanced scans the nodes were of low attenuation \u00ab 30 HU) in 18 cases and of soft-tissue attenuation (>35 HU) in 20. Three postcontrast patterns of enhancement were found: A) Peripheral rim enhancement without or with low to moderate increase of attenuation at the center of the nodes (22 cases), B) homogeneous enhancement (8 cases) and C) non-homogeneous enhancement (8 cases). In 1 cases a combination of A and (B-C) patterns was seen at the same nodal group. The central enhancement was usually moderate (mean 30 HU) but in 3 instances strong enhancement (mean 60 HU) was found. Obliteration of peri nodal rat was evident in 13 cases most of them with A pattern.",

Although the \"nomograma\" gives us just a dose orientation, this is enough to verify the decrease of radiation received by the patient by using rare earth screens. The average obtained with different explorations shows us that the use of rare earth screens involves a reduction about 58,9% of the absorbed radiation by the patient without significative decrease of X-Ray quality. Due to the great volume of radiodiagnostic explorations in ambulatory patients, we must optimize the radiation dose suffered by customers, even more if we consider the check controls for chronical patients which represents a high percent of our explorations.",

All patients were male. the mean age was 32 years (range: 22-65). 14 patients (60.8%) were parenteral drug abusers, 6 (26.8%) homosexual males, and 3 (13%) belonged to other risk groups. Conventional radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography were performed. Results: 16 patients (69.5%) presented NHL and 7 patients (30.5%) HD. Characteristically, all the lymphomas were of intermediate or high-grade SUbtypes. 13 patients (75%) with NHL and 7 (100%) with HD had advanced disease (stage 3 or 4) at presentation. Extensive abdominal adenopathy (retroperitoneum, mesentery) was found in 4 patients (25%) with NHL and in 4 (57.1 %) with HD. 10 patients (62.5%) with NHL and 5 (71.4%) with HD had extranodal involvement.

Methods: In our hospital the post-operative follow-up of these patients is:periodical sonography of the liver. -and determination ofCEA blood levels. If one or both of these tests are positive, CT-portography is performed to establish the presence of metastases in the liver and subsequently be informed about the precise number of metastases and their localization related to the vascular and bile tree. Results: Of 15 patients are presented, 5 patients (33%) appeared to be inoperable on the basis of CT-portography. In 4 patients CT-portography demonstrated more metastases than was shown on US.

Gilabert (Presenter), C. Bru, J. M. Campistol, L. Bianchi, R. Vilana; BarcelonaA VGR is a severe form of acute graft rejection that requires early diagnosis and treatment. The aim of the study was to determine prospectively the utility of PO in monitoring graft response to OK-T3 or ALG in severe (steroid resistant) AVGR. The study group included 15 patients with AVGR, documented by renal biopsy, treated with OK-TI (8 p.) or ALG (7 p.) who were sequentially studied with PD. PO spectrum was obtained at all arterial renal levels and was quantified by the Resistive Index (RI). PO studies were done 48 hours postgrafting. in graft dysfunction episodes and in monitoring graft response to rejection treatment. All AVGR episodes coursed with abnormal PO studies: RI range: 0.89-1. with decreased, absent or reversal diastolic blood flow. Normalization of diastolic blood flow was documented prior to the decrease of serum creatinine in 12 patients who recovered from rejection. No RI improvement was found in the remaining 3 patients who did not recover their graft function. Conclusions: PO was a useful tool in the follow-up of AVGR. Prompt recovery of PO spectrum suggests a good prognosis. Mendelsberg, O. Oroz. B. Dufour, J. F. Moreau; Paris",

This anatomical description would appear to be essential as it has now been clearly established that chronic anterior lallity of the knee is due to destabilisation of the lateral condyle secondary to loss of the two principal stabilising elements of the lateral compartment: the anterior cruciate ligament and the popliteus within the posterolateral angle point. d) Conclusions: At present, MRI is the only non-invasive method which provides evidence, during the same ellamination, of both central pivot injury and peripheral damage, especially of the popliteal area, with great diagnostic accuracy.SPACE 1632MRI features of traumatic lesions of the posterior cruclate ligament (P.C.L.) B. Roger (Presenter). C. Grataloup, D. Folinais, P. Christel, M. Laval-Jeantet; Paris a) Aim of the study: lesions of the posterior cruciate ligament are less frequent than lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament and often pass unnoticed because of their relatively good tolerance and the absence of any early formal signs allowing establishment of the diagnosis. Therapeutic approaches also appear to be less well defined with a current tendency towards orthopaedic treatment by plaster immobilisation in slight flexion. The efficacy of treatment depends on how early it is instituted. b) Methods: For this study, the files of 25 patients who underwent an MRI examination for pel damage were reviewed. Mutual comparison of MRI findings with the clinical, arthroscopic and/or arthrotomic ellaminations was made. c) Results: By directly demonstrating the posterior cruciate ligament, with an elltremely sensitive analysis of the lesions, MRI is useful in minor forms in which the posterior luity is insufficient to conclude on the diagnosis or in complex forms associated with rupture of the central pivot. In recent lesions, the rupture is generally situated in the upper part of the ligament and is reflected by a high intensity signal on T2-weighted sequences. In the forms seen some time after the trauma, it is mainly the morphology of the ligament which is modified: distended, sinuous, of variable thickness with localised cicatricial intraligamentous signal changes. Injection of paramagnetic contrast agent (Dotarem\u00ae) provides more accurate analysis of injured ligaments. d) Conclusions: MRI of injured knees should therefore allow an earlier and faster diagnosis of lesions of the posterior cruciate ligament. of the study: The extrasynovial and intracapsular intercondylar notch is inaccessible to arthrographic investigations when the synovium remains intact. Under normal conditions, it essentially contains the cruciate ligaments and fatty connective tissue. b) Methods: Direct visualisation of this region by MRI enabled the authors to identify a disease poorly demonstrated by other investigation techniques in 14 patients. There is a modification of the signal of the intercondylar notch with no abnormalities of the cruciate ligament. c) Results: The lesion shows a low-intesity signal on T1-weighted sequences (less marked than that of the ligaments) and a very marked high-intensity signal on T2-weighted sequences. It is associated with loss of the fatty connective tissue and a convex appearance of the capsule due to the mass effect. The absence of intraarticular effusion confirms the extra synovial site of the lesion. In every case, the patient presents clinically with a posterolateral pain syndrome with discomfort during knee flexion. Both testing and the arthrographic assessment are normal. Two etiologies are detected: pseudocystic liquid lesion and a mixed, cystic and angiomatous degenerative lesion. Injection of paramagnetic contrast agent (Gd-DOTA, i.e. Dotarem\u00ae, Guerbet) allows differentiation between the two aetiologies. The signal of the pure cystic form does not vary between Tl-and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, while the cystic and angiomatous form is contrast enhanced. d) Conclusions: MRI is therefore valuable for the diagnosis of these lesions and for proposing simple treatment, particularly in the cystic form with puncture-evacuation under ultrasound guidance.SPACE 1634Rhabdomyolysls In computed tomography: a cese raport K.

The SS is a very uncommon cause of stroke that affects mainly women in their middle age. The radiological findings of SS lies mainly in cerebral angiography and computed tomography (CT). Purpose: We performed Magnetic resonance (MR) on ten patients with SS to compare the usefulness of MR findings with those of arteriography and CT in the diagnosis and follow up of the patients. Methods and Materials: MR imaging was performed on a RM Max GE unit of 0.5 T. T-I and T-2 weighted axial images were studied. Results: On MR three types of lesions were found: I. large and medium size infarctions in the territory of middle and posterior cerebral arteries. These lesions were seen as focal areas of low density on CT, and as intravascular occlusion on cerebral angiography. 2. Diffuse cerebral cortical atrophy, usually seen on CT. 3. A special MR finding was multiple areas of increased signal intensity in subcortical area, in the deep white matter and in the posterior fossa.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of TEE and MRI for the evaluation of non-rheumatic AR. Methods and Materials: An analysis was made 5 patients with acute and severe AR. Transthoracic echo cardiography (TIE) and angiogram were performed in all 5, TEE in 4, and MRI in 4. TEE was performed with color-doppler flow. MRI was obtained with 1.5 T on transverse and coronal images. Results: TIE failed to identify the precise cause of AR, but demonstrated pouch formation of non-coronary cusp (Neq in 2 patients. In 4 patients TEE disclosed aortic valve prolapse (AVP) manifested by 2 major findings; non-visualized coaptation of aortic valve and eccentric regurgitation flow with color-doppler in diastole. The pouch formation of NCC, due to Takayasu's arteritis and clinically diagnosed Beh,.et disease, was visualized more clearly on both TEE and MRI than TIE. MRI revealed invagination of the pouch into the ventricular septum in 2, and localized ascending aortic aneurysm in I. Surgery was performed in 2 patients, confirming AVP caused by myxomatous degeneration and aortic aneurysm. Conclusions: OUT preliminary results suggest that TEE may be the modality of choice to clarify the etiology and site of non-rheumatic AR. MRI offers a valuable information about the aortic root, especially on coronal images. examinations were carried out by color Doppler ultrasound. A reflux of the great saphenous vein was detected in 17 cases, of the small saphenous vein in 12 cases and of the femoral vein in 5 cases. 25 investigations were correlated with ascending phlebography. In all cases an excellent correlation was found obtained by both modalities. However, dynamic manoeuvres in color Doppler ultrasound contributed to a higher degree of confidence in diagnosis. 12 examinations by color Doppler ultrasound were correlated with clinical findings. There were no significant differences between the diagnoses obtained by color Doppler ultrasound and the clinical findings.",

All of the prosthetic cardiac valves used clinically have been implanted surgically. Our objective in this project is to construct and experimentally evaluate an alternative device which can be placed percutaneously, obviating the need for general anesthesia and open heart surgery. To date, eleven adult mongrel dogs have received our prosthetic valve. Results of these studies have led to several design modifications. At present, prosthetic valve is a ball-in-cage design. The valve system can be collpased and pushed through an II-French catheter system. Since the assembly is self-expanding, it opens as it exits the catheter. The final step is placement of the ball into the cage. Additional studies are now in progress to evaluate the current design with regard to thrombogenicity, hemodynamic function, durability and biocompatibility.Access to the subclavian vein for percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters is usually obtained by \"blind\" percutaneous puncture. Possible complications of this technique are pneumothorax, hemothorax, arterial punctures and nerve injury. We describe a new technique using ultrasound guided punc'ufte of the target vein and fluoroscopic control of the guide-wire and the catheter position. With ultrasound the subclavian vein and the surrounding anatomical structures. can be visualized, thereby minimizing the risk of the puncture related complications. Controlling the position of the guide-wire and catheter by fluoroscopy reduces the change of catheter malpositions. Using this combined technique we performed 82 catheter placements. Long term administration of chemotherapy for hematological malignancies was the most frequent indication to place the Hickman catheter. All punctures were successful and no puncture related complications occurred. We consider ultrasound guided percutaneous placements of Hickman catheters superior to other methods.",

Gangi; Sherbrooke, QuebecPurpose: To determine the contribution of US examination in the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Methods: From February 1987 to March 1990, abdominal sonography was performed in 96 patients with suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis. All those patients had underwent abdominal radiotherapy for malignancy. Peritoneal carcinomatosis were confirmed by clinical follow-up and/or pathologic findings at surgery or autopsy in 53 patients (62 percent). Results: Recurrence was detected by US examination in 19 patients (36 percent) on the presence of visceral metastases or adenopathies. Abundant ascites was present in 9 patients (17 percent). In 7 patients (13 percent) there were no US findings suggesting malignant recurrence. Sonographic examination detected peritoneal carcinomatosis in 18 patients (34 percent). These sonographic findings were: Fan shaped mesentery (4 cases) peritoneal nodules (5 cases), hyperechoic bowel wall (9 cases). There were 3 false positives among 33 patients with no recurrent tumor. The sensitivity of sonography was 81 percent and the specificity 90 percent with an accuracy achieved of 88 percent.

To the date, pseudocysts in 37 patients have been drained in our service. In this exhibit, we show the technique and indications for pseudocyst drainage. The management is as follows. Once a pseudocyst is diagnosed, we follow it with U.S. or C.T. for 2 to 4 weeks. If the pseudocyst remains larger than 4 cm or it is symptomatic, the intervention is instituted. First, we perform a fine needle (22-gauge) aspiration. Afterwards, a iodinated contrast or an isotope should be instilated in the cavity to demonstrate communication with the ductal system. An endoscopic retrograde pancreatography can be performed with the same purpose. I. If a communication is not demonstrated, the simple aspiration is considered adequate. 2. If the pseudocyst relapses after (I), a communication is demonstrated, or in every case when the pseudocyst is infected, a catheter has to be placed. (We use a tandem trocar-catheter insertion). The duration of the drainage ranges from I to 4 weeks in our experience. If the pseudocyst relapses, an open surgery is indicated.Color flow Doppler of visceral organs and non occlusive vascular disease Stanton J. Rosenthal (Presenter). Linda Harrison, Louis H.

Bosio, E. Juliani, F. Russo (Presenter). R. Zatteri; TorinoStrictureplasty is a recent surgical procedure that allows repair of chronic intestinal strictures due to Crohn's disease, without the need for bowel resection. This surgical treatment consists, as in pyloroplasty, of a longitudinal incision across the stricture and transverse suturing. Different surgical approaches, according to different pathological situations, are adopted: Heineke-Mikulicz, Finney, Judd and Mosche-Walske-Neumayer techniques. Twelve patients with fibrotic small bowel strictures secondary to long-standing Crohn's disease underwent a total of 32 strictureplasties from November 1985 to December 1990. At least one SBE was performed in all cases before and after surgery; radiological follow-up period ranges from I month to 4 years after surgery. Preoperatory SBE showed every single Crohn's stricture, as confirmed at surgery: furthermore early postoperative SBE demonstrated the euct sites of plasties and good results of intervention in all cases. 18 and 25 months after surgery SHE showed recurrence at strictureplasties' sites in 2 patients, who underwent reintervention.

Knopp (Presenter). Hans-Ulrich Kauczor. Stefan Delorme. Bruno Betsch. Gunther Layer. Wolfhard Semmler. Alois Knopp. Gerhard van Kaick; HeidelbergPurpose: To develop a reliable, standardized technique of contrast media application for CT and MRI with the use of a double peristaltic infusion pump. Greatest emphasis had to be placed on practicability. reliability and lowest financial cost. Methods and Materials: A double peristaltic infusion pump designed for intensive care treatment with a flow rate of 1-99 mllmin. was found to be the best practical choice. This pump was used in conjunction with a remote control. The original infusion bottle with the supplied infusion line was used with a \"Brauniile\" for Lv. puncture. CTcontrast media was prewarmed to body temperature. Results: In an initial evaluation the reliability and practicability of the infusion pump was evaluated. We found a reliability of99% in summary of all different procedures. Depending on the location of the patient no additional recurrent cost in addition to the supplied infusion line were realised except an additional extension line as necessary. Quantitative evaluation of contrast enhancement measured by H.U. showed an average enhancement of 348% compared to 280% using a manual bolus technique. The time of contrast in vascular structures in the thorax was prolonged by at least 35 %. The contrast enhancement as well as contrast homogeneity were significantly improved in studies of the thorax. head and neck, liver as well as pelvis. Conclusions: A double peristaltic infusion pump enables optimized application of contrast media for CT and MRI, improving enhancement, contrast homogeneity as well as time of contrast without any additional recurrent cost.MagnetIc resonance functional Imaging of cerebral perfusIon in the rabbit C.

Speck; LeuvenPurpose: MRI study of the pharmacodynamics and of the vascular enhancement capability of Od-DTPA Polylysine in the rabbit and the rat. Methods: MRI was performed at 1.5 T using a SE sequence (300/15 ms). Signal intensities of the liver, kidneys and muscle were measured before and up to 2 weeks after injection of 0.1 mmollkg Od-DTPA Polylysine in the rabbit (n = 3) and the rat (n -3). Additional rabbits were injected with 0.04. 0.2 and 0.4 mmol/kg to study the dose response. A 3-D inflow FISP MRA sequence was used to image the vessels. Results: The pharmacodynamics are similar in the rabbit and the rat. The liver intensity is enhanced by 60% and decreases with a halflife of about 60 min. The kidney medulla and cortex are enhanced by much larger factors (3 to 4) and the half life is about one day. The muscle intensity is not significantly affected. The 0.1 mmol/kg dose is optimal for the liver since T2 effects predominate at higher concentrations. Superb angiogrammes of the rabbit posterior limbs were obtained; submillimeter arteries and veins were visualised over the entire length of the limbs even at the low dose of 0.02 mmollkg. Conclusions: Od-DTPA Polylysine is a promising agent for MR contrast and MRA studies.Pulse sequence optimIzatIon In 100 patIents with urinary bladder carcinoma at 1.5 T Jelle O. Barentsz (Presenter). Sjef H. J. Ruijs. Leon J. T. O. van Erning. Chris J. G. Bakker; NIJmegenPurpose: To determine the optimal pulse sequence(s) for staging urinary bladder cancer (UBC). Methods: In 14 patients with UBC TI and T2 values of perivesical fat, bladder wall, urine. and tumor were estimated. On the basis of these values contrast matrices were calculated, from which the sequences with optimal contrast between these structures could be derived. Additionally, the changes in contrast between these structures were illustrated by synthetic imaging. To confirm the value of the found pulse sequences in Staging of UBC, they were applied for 100 patients with UBC. Results: Optimal staging of UBC requires at least 2 pulse sequences: I. A TI weighted pulse sequence (SFI750/IS) is optimal to determine tumor invasion in perivesical fat, and to recognise enlarged Iymphnodes and bone marrow infiltration. 2. A T2 weighted pulse sequence (SFI2100/30. 100) is optimal to determine tumor invasion in bladder wall, prostate. seminal vesicles or uterus. and to differentiate between tumor and fibrosis. The STIR sequence (IRI2000/17S/60) is superior to the SFI2I00/30, 100 sequence to recognise bone marrow metastases. Conclusions: Optimal pulse sequenced for staging UBC are SE17S0/lS and SF12100/30, 100. In bone marrow metastases the IRI2000/17S160 sequence has advantages over the SF12100120, 100 sequence.Disseminated cerebral tuberculosis P. Benz (Presenter), A. Seeliger. G. Hamann. B. Junk. U. Hau.

Methods and Materials: 3 patients underwent MRI of the liver because of lesions detected on sonography or computed tomography. One patient had a clinical history of neoplastic disease (breast cancer); all patients are clinically suspected of metastatic disease. MRI examinations were performed with 1.5 T system (Signa, General Electric) with various spin-echo sequences. Results: All lesions appeared hyperechoic on sonography, with low attenuation density on CT, and a high signal intensity on TI and T2 sequences, suggesting fat tissue. Conclusions: In our experience, MRI can resolve confusion between focal fatty infiltration of the liver and metastatic disease.Gd-DOTA enhanced MRI of renal tumors A. Denys (Presenter), O. Helenon, L. Rotkopf, E. Atlan, N. Lebo, Y. Chretien. B. Dufour. J. F. Moreau; ParisPurpose: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the contribution of Gd-DOTA in the MR diagnostic of renal tumors and for the staging of renal cell carcinoma. Methods and Materials: We explored 20 renal cell carcinoma (including 4 cystic carcinomas) and 6 benign tumors. We performed TI and T2 weighted SE sequences, and dynamic fast gradient echo sequences after bolus of Gd-DOTA. Results: MR results has been correlated to macroscopic and pathologic datas (26126). Gd-DOTA injection does not improve the MR staging of renal cell carcinoma. Dynamic sequences seem to can differentiate good prognostic papillary carcinoma from clear cell carcinoma. Gd-DOTA provides a better analysis of the wall of cystic carcinomas. The characterization of benign indeterminate tumors is not improved by Gd-DOTA. Conclusions: The use of Gd-DOTA does not improve the staging of renal carcinomas but is helpful to characterize cystic carcinomas and papillary carcinoma.Can dynemlc contrast-enhanced MRllmprove the differentiation of focal liver lesions?Ch. Ehrenheim (Presenter), H. Petersen, K. F. Gratz, R. Weimann, H.Hundeshagen; Hannover Patients and methods: 35 patients with liver tumors (hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia FNH, hepatocellular carcinoma HCC, metastases) underwent MRI of the liver before and after i.v. bolus injection of 0,2 ml/kg Gadolinium-DTPA in addition to other dynamic imaging methods (HBSS, RBC scan using Tc-99m-labelled erythrocytes). Dynamic MR studies using a gradient echo sequence (FLASH) were done in addition to conventionally acquired TI-and T2-weighted images. Two different dynamic studies with various delay times were applied depending on the presumptive diagnosis. Results: Characteristic kinetics and uptake patterns were found: Liver hemangiomas show the most intensive uptake of Gd-DTPA. In the dynamic study the negative tumor-liver contrast first increases, and subsequently the lesion shows a delayed centripetal filling in. This facilitates the differentiation hemangioma/malignant tumor being similar in native images. The demarcation of FN H is usually not influenced by late contrast-enhanced images as it almost behaves like surrounding normal liver tissue: again dynamic MRI reveals the characteristic hyperperfusion. so that this combination of findings makes the diagnosis. Finally, Gd-DTPA presents a mixed pattern of uptake and distribution in HCC and metastases with hyperperfusion as a common finding. The post contrast images usually show a moderate inhomogeneous e.g. ring-shaped enhancement. again the combined findings giving the diagnostic hint. Conclusions: Dynamic MRI is useful in the diagnosis of liver tumors and improves the differentiation of focal lesions.Dynamic Gd-DTPA MRI evaluation of breast lesions P. Ercolani (Presenter), G. M. Giuseppetti, E. de Nigris, S. Baldassarre, A. Segoni, A. Giovagnoni; AnconaPurpose: The purpose of this study is to define the diagnostic value of dynamic Gd-DTPA MR examination in the tissue characterization of breast lesion. Methods and Materials: 125 patients (53 years old) with different breast lesions (51 carcinomas, 18 fibroadenomas, 18 cysts and 44 treated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy) underwent MRI investigation after a mammographic and US examinations. 51 breast cancers had histopathologic correlation and the others were followed up for I year. SE TI -T2 pulse sequences and FLASH 20 were used. A dynamic enhancement series was obtained when nodular lesion was demonstrated. GE images (100112, FL = 70\u00b0) were performed before and after the intravenous injection ofGd-DTPA (0.2 mMol/Kg) at nineteen second intervals for eight minutes. Lesion parenchyma signal intensity ratio was calculated. Results: All histologically proved carcinomas showed a signilicative increase of MR signal intensity within the first minutes after i.v. injection of contrast agent and nearly a plateau level afterwards. In cases of benign lesions dynamic behaviour of signal intensity showed a lower and slower increase in comparison with malignant lesion and a plateau level after 8 minutes. Our results indicate the diagnostic value of dynamic Gd-DTPA MRI in all cases with an undefined clinical and/or mammographic findings.Computed tomography and magnetic resonance Imaging of the chest aHer surgery for bronchogenic carcinoma G. M. Favagrossa (Presenter); Leno 14 patients have been examined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 13 by Computed Tomography (Cn of the chest in the follow-up after surgery for bronchogenic carcinoma. The patients were undergone to pneumonectomy(2), lobectomy (II) and segmentectomy (I) for: 10 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 adenocarcinomas, I small cell carcinoma. MRI was performed using a 1,5-Tsystem in all patients; MRI included TI-and T2-weighted sequences on axial views in all patients. TI-weighted sequences were performed also on coronal views in 10 patients and on sagittal views in 3 patients. CTexamination was performed from 15 to 3 days before MRI; one patient did not performe CT because of intolerance to contrast media. MRI confirmed CT in 7 cases and was better in 6: in 3 cases of recurrence and in 3 cases of Iymphoadenopathy of mediastinum. MRI of the chest in the follow-up of bronchogenic carcinoma after surgery is useful when CT examination is not resolutive to identify a recurrence and/or a Iymphoadenopathy of the mediastinum, and often to distinguish a recurrence from postirradiated tissue.SPACE 1l!! MR follow-up of cirrhotic liver: tissue characterization of carcinomatous and non-carcinomatous focal lesions at 1.5 tesla F. Ferrozzi (Presenter), A. Rossi, R. Silva, L. Rossi; ParmaPurpose: with the current technical advances in imaging modalities. small focal lesions are now detected with relative case and increasing frequency in the cirrhotic liver follow-up. However the imaging findings of small HCC are often non-specific and the differentiation from non-cancerous spaceoccupying lesions, particulary adenomatous hyperplastic nodules. is difficult. We evaluated the role of MRI. Methods and Materials: findings on 50 patients affected by liver cirrhosis examinated by MR 1.5 T unit are reported. TI (TR 350-500. TE 20-30) and T2 (TR 1800-2000, TE 80-100) SE sequences were performed. Results: 30 histologically proven small HCC (121 15-35 mm) are detected. All the lesions were hyperintense on T2-weighted images, while TI images are not specific (hyperintense 5/30. isointense 18/30, hypointense 7/30). All the 5 adenomatous hyperplastic macronodules detected were hypointense on T2 images (215 hyperintense, 3/5 hypointense on TI). Regenerating siderotic micro-nodules are detected in 40/50 patients in form of hypointense focal lesions only on T2 images. The 2 false-negative cases are dependent to poor quality technique of the examen and a small size of the lesions (10 mm). Conclusions: results obtained demonstrated that MRI is a very useful technique in the differential diagnosis of focal lesions in cirrhotic liver.Purpose: The purpose of this work was to define the diagnostic possibilities of MRI in patient's monitoring after sphincter-saving anterior resection of the rectum. Methods and Materials: 23 patients (14 M, 9 F) who had undergone an anterior resection for recto-sigmoid carcinoma were studied. MRI investigation was performed by a tomograph 1.0 T (Magnetom). Multiplanar, multi slice SE TI and T2 pulse sequences were obtained. All patients were examined before and after retrograde colon filling using a paramagnetic contrast agent. 6 patients were studied after i.v. somministration of Gd-DTPA. 12 patients were studied I month post-up (group I) and II patients (group II) 6 months or more later from surgical treatment. MRI findings were correlated with traditional techniques and surgical or bioptic data. Results: In group I, 6 patients demonstrated MRI abnormalities not visualized by traditional imaging modalities. In group II, MRI identified local recurrence in 4 patients and to define the fibrotic nature of a presacral process misinterpreted by CT in 2 cases. Conclusions: MRI with contrast agent has proved its usefulness in follow-up after lower GI tract conservative surgical treatment.MRI In pra-surglcal evaluatIon of abdominal aortIc aneurysm Impending ruptura A.

Methods and Materials: 30 patients (23 M. 7 F) with abdominal aortic aneurysm impending rupture were studied. All patients underwent previously, abdominal US. MRI investigation was performed by a tomograph 1.0 T (Magnetom). One SE TI pulse sequence on axial plane as scout image (acquisition time = 22 sec) and two SE TI pulse sequences on coronal and sagittal planes (acquisition time = 1.30 min) were obtained. The investigation time resulted ranged between \\0 to 25 minutes. All patients underwent surgical treatment (I h. to 12 h. from MRI investigation). Results: MRI showed in 6 cases posterior parietal interruption with retroperitoneal bleeding, in \\0 cases a subrenal short aortic collar and in 14 cases an aortic collar under the left renal vein. Renal aneurysmatic involvement was shown in 4 cases; in one case, autoctone dissection of abdominal. subrenal. aortic aneurysm was identified while in 3 cases inflammatory aneurysms misinterpreted by traditional methods as CT, US and angiography were correctly demonstrated. Examination time shortening allowed to utilize successfully MRI in the evaluation of aortic abdominal aneurysms impending rupture.Colon enema with paramagnetic contrast agents In MRI evaluation of pelviC masses A. Giovagnoni (Presenter). P. Ercolani, M. Misericordia, D. Migliorini, E. de Nigris; AnconaPurpose: The purpose of this study is to define the diagnostic utility of colon enema with paramagnetic contrast agents in MRI evaluation of pelvic masses. Methods: 35 patients (25 F, 10 M)wilh pelvic masses (10 ovarian, 12 ulerine.13 retroperitoneal neoplasms) proved by traditional methods (US, CT, BE) were studied. MRI investigations were performed before and after retrograde rectosigmoid filling by 300 ml of paramagnetic contrast agent: 18 patients using Gd-DTPA acqueous solution (I mM), 17 patients using a home-made Fe-gluconate solution (J KA I). A superconductive 1.0 T Magnetom tomograph was used. Multiplanar, SE TI and T2 images were obtained. MRI findings before and after colon enema were evaluated independently by two observers. MRI findings were correlated with surgical or pathological data. Results: The colon enema with paramagnetic contrast agents provided a better identification of pelvic masses limits in 87% of cases, to evaluate in 4 cases' colon infiltration misinterpreted with no contrast MRI investigation was correctly demonstrated. In 6 cases lymph nodes were easy distinguished by bowel wall when intestinal lumen was filled. Conclusions: Our experience suggests the routine use of colon enema with paramagnetic contrast agents in MRI of the pelvis.Small MR Imagar and NMR spectrometer G. Gomiscek (Presenter), E. Moser, A.

Methods and Materials: 3IP-MRS of the liver was performed on 8 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with diffuse liver disease. (I case of acute hepatitis, 5 cases of chronic hepatitis, 5 cases of pre-cirrhosis, 9 cases of liver cirrhosis). Volume localization was fulfilled by using ISIS sequence. Peak values of phosphorus signals relative to p-adenosine triphosphate, intracellular hepatic pH, signal intensity, pattern of spectra and comparison histological diagnosis with 31 P-MRS about some cases based on clinical diagnosis of chronic hepatitis or precirrhosis were evaluated. Results: Chemical shift and pH show no significant differentiation in each group. Liver cirrhosis shows typical pattern of spectrum with attenuation of signal intensity and high phosphomonoester ratio. Alcoholic diffuse liver disease mimicked normal pattern of spectrum, which was though to become a non-invasive clue to differentiate from other type of diffuse liver disease.MR-Imaglng of an. agyrla B.

Mathieu (Presenter); Criltell Purpose: In order to evaluate the clinical potential of Snapshot Flash MR imaging in liver tumors. Methods and Materials: 65 patients with liver tumors including: metastasis (18), hepatocellular carcinoma(17), hemangioma (18), FNH (8), and adenoma (4) were imaged using this prospective protocol on a MAGNETOM SP 63 1.5 T: T2-weighted images, unenhanced and enhanced Snapshot Flash sequences after bolus IV injection of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DOTA, and finally delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images. Results: I. All the lesions were detected on unenhanced Snapshot Flash MR images, 2. On T2-weighted images no more lesions were depicted than seen on enhanced Snapshot Flash MR sequence, 3. Snapshot Flash imaging is better than T2-weighted images for differentiating hemangioma from hypervascular metastases. Conclusions: At 1.5 T, despite its low spatial resolution, subsecond dynamic Snapshot Flash MR imaging is a sequence as accurate as spin-echo T2 weighted in detection and characterization of liver tumors.Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (lH NMRS) of normoxic and Ischemic ranal tissueF.

Mali;Purpose: In vivo 31p MR spectroscopy is nowadays commonly used to investigate, non invasively, the metabolic state or viability of several organs. 31 P MR spectroscopy also could obtain information about the viability of transplant kidneys, and the effect on renal viability, when using different preservation solutions. Methods: lip MR spectroscopy was performed on twenty human transplant kidneys, 2 hours before transplantation, I till 24 hours after explantation. Six kidneys were preserved in Euro Collins (Ee) solution, six kidneys were preserved in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. whereas eight kidneys were preserved in HTK solution. Image guided, volume selective 31p MR spectroscopy, at O\u00b0C, was performed, using a 1.5Twhoie body spectrometer. Results and Conclusions: In the kidneys who were preserved in UW and EC, large phosphomonoester (PM) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) peaks could be observed. However, both peaks did not show any significant correlation both with the time after explantation and renal viability after transplantation. The 31 P MR spectra of kidneys who were preserved in HTK did show in addition to PM and Pi resonances also adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphodiester (PD) resonances. The intensity of these latter peaks showed a positive correlation with the viability of the transplant kidney, which was approved by renal viability after transplantation. Since renal A TP and PD peaks are absent when kidneys are preserved in UW or EC solution, 31p MR spectroscopy is not capable to predict renal viability after transplantation when kidneys are preserved in one of these solutions. However, when kidneys are preserved in HTK, 31p MR spectroscopy is a non invasive technique to predict renal viability before transplantation.Early cervical carcinoma (FIGO stage IA): diagnostic accuracy of MAl A.

            "text": "The purpose of this exhibit is to show different MRI manifestations and characteristics of hydatid disease. Fourteen (14) examinations were performed on a 1.5 T scanner using short TR/TE and long TRITE 2000/100 conventional SE pulse sequences. Slice thickness = 8 mm. NEX -4 (short TR/TE sequence) and 2 (long TR/TE sequence). Six (6) examinations were performed on a 0.5 T scanner. Results: I. The excellent contrast resolution renders M R I the best single test to study both cyst contents and reactive changes of the host tissue. 2. The characteristic but non-specific low intensity wall of the intact cyst represents both the endocyst (parasitic membranes) and the pericyst (host reaction). 3. Degenerative changes of the cyst wall and subsequent rupture can be directly visualized on MRI. 4. The multi planar imaging capability of MRI allows superior mapping of the spread of hydatid disease. 5. MRI is an excellent method to monitor the full effects of albendazole treatment on both the cyst and host tissue.6. Despite the fact that calcifications are better seen on CT, MRI may be considered the method of choice to image the spectrum of hydatid disease.Three dimensional MR angiography with 0.3 T vertical field MAl Hiroshi Nishimura, Shigeru Watanabe (Presenter), Shinji Kawasaki; Chiba Purpose: Our main purpose is to evaluate MR angiography for making effective visualization of vascular structure with 0.3 T vertical field M RI through comparison of 3 dimensional phase sensitive and sequential acquisitions of 2 dimensional inflow in 3 dimensional display. Methods: We have developed both 3 dimensional phase sensitive MR angiography obtained by sequence subtraction of dephasing gradient echo from rephasing (velocity-compensated) one, and 2 dimensional sequential inflow by rephasing gradient echo. M R angiograms were obtained with a ray tracing of the new modified maximum intensity projection at various viewing angles. These images are displayed on CRT in high speed cyclic mode to depict the front-rear relation of vessels for recognition. Results: Using Eddy-current\u00b7free magnet system, 3 dimensional phase sensitive MRA could depict crisp intracranial vascular structure and there was improved delineation of middle cerebral artery branches and arterior cerebral arteries at low !lip angle. Sequential 2D inflow revealed effective for cervical and abdominal vascular structures. Conclusions: We could obtain an excellent detectability of vascular structures by both 3D phase sensitive and 2D inflow even with 0.3 T vertical field MRI. Arteries and veins could be differentiated well with presaturation of upperstream.Assessment of cerebral blood flow with dynamic contrast-enhanced T2* weighted gradient echo Images Klaus U.

Siegel; Kansas City, KS Purpose: Faithful IiIm hardcopy reproduction by laser film printers of images displayed on high\u00b7resolution gray\u00b7scale workstations is diagnostically mandatory. This exhibit demonstrates a technique for accomplishing faithful reproduction on laser film printers. Methods and Materials: A gray-scale controller has been developed by our Department. The controller samples the viewing screen of the gray\u00b7scale monitor. This sample is processed and the results are used to automatically select the optimum lookup table for faithfully reproducing the displayed images. The gray\u00b7scale controller has been evaluated for CT, MRI, and storage phosphor plate images. Results: An evaluation of the gray-scale controller demonstrates that with careful selection of the display's assigned gray levels and with proper modification of the laser printer's lookup tables, the laser printed images faithfully reproduce the displayed images. The gray scale display is driven by 8 bit digital-to-analog converters. The laser film printer generates 12 bit pixel values. Our gray-scale controller enables the laser film printer to faithfully reproduce images presented on the gray scale monitors.",
