Anti-HIV drugs target HIV reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase or the coiled coil domain of gp41. Used in combinations of three or more, they are very effective at treating HIV infection: patients with advanced AIDS have shown dramatic albeit incomplete recovery of CD4 + T cell counts and immune function, though sometimes the revitalized immune response causes severe problems by reacting to previously silent infecting pathogens. Yet even when virus loads have become undetectable for several years, cessation of drugs results in rapid rebound of virus and return to the pretreatment levels 4 . This implies that patients need to take these drugs for life. But because of serious side effects and expense, indefinite treatment is not possible for most of the world. Drug resistance by virus mutation is well described 5 and although triple therapy reduces the risk substantially, imperfect adherence to treatment regimes may result in selection of resistant virus. As is the case for tuberculosis, this could limit treatment options in the near future. Transmission, however, can be reduced by 'safer sex' practices.

M. tuberculosis is protected by a recalcitrant cell wall rich in waxes and other glycolipids 7 , which is responsible for the unique staining characteristics of these microbes and contributes significantly to resistance against host defense. Infected macrophages and DCs, therefore, do not destroy their bacterial prey and thus serve as a mobile habitat, transporting the microbes to the lung parenchyma and eventually to the draining lymph nodes 8, 9 . Infected macrophages attract monocytes and a lesion develops. DCs in the lymph nodes present mycobacterial antigens to T cells.

It is now generally agreed that the best possible (rather than best regional) therapy should be offered to all trial participants who become infected; the unresolved questions are for how long and when, given that drugs may not be required for 5-10 years. Although it is desirable to insist on the highest safety standards for any vaccine candidate as defined by the FDA and the EMEA it may be worthwhile to carefully assess whether risk-benefit relationships differ for countries with low or high tuberculosis or AIDS prevalence. Side effects of new vaccine candidates may be tolerable for a vaccine that can prevent tuberculosis or AIDS mortality and morbidity in countries where incidences are skyrocketing, but not for countries with low tuberculosis or AIDS prevalence 118 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1009, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From animal models to clinical trials"}, {"text": "HIV and tuberculosis vaccine trials will probably need multiple sites.

Consequently development of vaccines against tuberculosis and AIDS will be most successful as joint public-private enterprise with support from governmental and nongovernmental funding organizations and philanthropic foundations. Such a consortium would be best equipped to bring forward vaccine development by a combination of 'push' and 'pull' programs. Although support for preclinical research will be best directed by classical push programs, incentives should be made available for alternative approaches 118 . The removal of roadblocks serves as a good example for a support strategy emphasizing innovation and not restrictive in the experimental approach.

In the absence of such incentives, even the best vaccine candidate may fail to reach the desired goal of unrestricted distribution in countries affected most by AIDS and tuberculosis. Lack of financial incentive may provide some unique opportunities for vaccine development against AIDS and tuberculosis. Notably, lowto-absent competition for financial profits can promote comparative clinical trials under the umbrella of governmental, nongovernmental or philanthropic organizations either alone or together with the aim first to select the most promising candidates, and second to proceed by 'learning by doing' (i.e., continuous vaccine improvement of candidates in iterative clinical trial processes). Analysis of the immune responses of vaccine trial participants may provide new information that can be further explored in experimental animal models and help to define the next clinical trial step.
