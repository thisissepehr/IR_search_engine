Although the clearance of an inhaled nebulised radioaerosol has long been employed as a measure of lung function, this test has not found favour in nuclear medicine units to the extent that might originally have been anticipated. In this review the theoretical basis of solute transfer is considered and the measurement of radioaerosol clearance discussed. Thereafter the various clinical applications of alveolar permeability measurement are outlined. Finally, possible reasons for the restricted clinical use of the diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid clearance technique are considered. It is concluded that the technique should provide a rapid screening evaluation of the HIV+ve patient presenting predominantly with chest symptoms.",

It also includes a film of fluid lining the airspace within which inhaled solutes are dissolved. Because they can penetrate cells directly, small lipophilic molecules, such as hexamethylpropylene amine oxime, rapidly penetrate the barrier [1] and the capacity for transfer from alveolus to blood is dependent on how rapidly they can be carried away from the barrier by pulmonary venous blood; i.e. their transfer rate is blood flow or perfusion-dependent. Transfer of hydrophilic solutes across the blood-gas barrier, on the other hand, is much slower as it depends on passive diffusion through the intercellular junctions of the epithelium and endothelium [2] [3] [4] ; the cross-sectional area of these spaces is miniscule compared with the total surface area of the barrier. Blood flow exerts a negligible influence on the transfer rate of a hydrophilic solute, which is said, therefore, to be perfusion-independent, or alternatively diffusion-dependent. Nevertheless, as blood flow decreases to low levels, diffusion-dependent transfer gradually becomes perfusion-dependent.",

Because of its availability and convenience, technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) has become established as the solute for this approach. Following inhalation, 99mTc-DTPA is cleared from the distal airway into pulmonary capillary blood and ultimately excreted in the urine.

Although the movement of gas in the airways beyond the 16th generation of bronchi is by molecular diffusion in air rather than convection [9] , there is evidence that aerosol particles penetrate to the distal airways and alveoli. Thus, whilst the half-time of 99mTc-DTPA pulmonary clearance in normal dogs is about 20 min, it is increased by ligation of the pulmonary artery but not of the bronchial arteries [10] . Occlusion of both pulmonary and bronchial flows greatly increases the half-time because collateral bronchial flow is responsible for the clearance after pulmonary arterial occlusion.",

            "text": "The clearance rate of a solute from distal airway is dependent on several factors related to the properties of both the solute and the lung. As already mentioned, lipophilic solutes are cleared very rapidly as a result of their ability to cross the epithelium by direct cellular penetration. Since their removal rate is perfusion-dependent, they have no value for the determination of epithelial integrity in the setting of radiolabelled solute clearance studies. Hydrophilic solutes, in contrast, exchange across the alveolar epithelium rauch more slowly at rates which depend on molecular charge and size. At normal levels of pulmonary blood flow, their transfer rates are diffusion-dependent and unaffected by changes in blood flow. The pores in the alveolar epithelium through which hydrophilic solutes diffuse are electrically charged and this explains why the transfer rate of a solute is dependent to some extent on its charge as well as its size. This was demonstrated by Barrowcliffe et al. [11] , who showed that neutral dextran has a shorter clearance half-time than similarly sized anionic or cationic dextran. The difference disappeared, however, following injury to the blood gas barrier induced by i.v. oleic acid, suggesting that the pore size and/or number increased and, additionally, lost charge. The pulmonary factors of potential importance in determining the rate of solute transfer, apart from disease itself, include regional surface area available for exchange, regional lung volume, intra-alveolar pressure, the composition and volume of the fluid in the alveoli, surfactant, and back-diffusion of solute from blood to lung interstitium.",

They were unable to distinguish between lung volume itself and the increase in surface area that accompanies an increase in lung volume, whether it was during or after inhalation of the solute. Expansion of the lung might be expected to stretch epithelial cells and pull them apart, thereby enlarging the diameter of the pores. Because of the arrangement of the alveolar septa in pleats, however, expansion in lung volume may not necessarily be associated with stretching of the alveolar walls [12, 13] .",

However, a biexponential curve is often seen when the clearance rate is markedly increased from any cause, raising the possibility of other explanations for the bi-exponential shape. These include firstly, deposition of aerosol more proximally in the airway, with slower clearance, and secondly, back-diffusion of tracer from blood to interstitium.

Immediately following the inhalation of aerosol, the count rate over the lung is continuously monitored with a scintillation probe or a gamma camera. Scintillation probes are more suited to the ICU, but a gamma camera is preferable if logistically possible. The curve recorded during the first 7-10 min in a normal subject is generally a straight line on a semilogarithmic plot but it then \"flattens off', partly because of recirculating intravascular tracer. When using a probe, the estimation of this blood background activity has conventionally been based on the count rate recorded from the thigh with a separate scintillation probe. The relationship between the thigh count rate and the pulmonary background signal is determined by giving an i.v. injection of a small dose of 99mTc-DTPA after the aerosol clearance rate has been measured. This approach assumes that the distribution of solute between intravascular and extravascular spaces is the same in the two regions. Since after i.v. 99mTc-DTPA, the pulmonay signal is predominantly an intravascular orte, while the thigh signal is an extravascular orte, this assumption is erroneous for the thigh. Use of a gamma camera to monitor pulmonary activity widens the scope of background correction since regions of interest can be placed over extrapulmonary tissues other than a limb. A useful background tissue is the liver since its extracellular space consists of intravascular and extravascular spaces of similar relative volumes as in the lung [24] . It is, furthermore, included in the field of view of the camera and projects a reasonably large area over which to place a region of interest. Conventionally, the i.v. dose of 99mTc-DTPA for calibration of background is given after the inhalation dose, but it is preferable to give it before because, as a smaller signal, it is more accurate to subtract it from the succeeding larger inhalation signal than the other way round. Indeed, it is not necessary to subtract the i.v. signal from the subsequent inhalation signal because since the liver curve has a shape identical to the intravascular background curve in the lung [24] it can be used for background subtraction at any stage of the lung curve, before or after inhalation. Indeed, it can be imagined that the i.v. dose has essentially the same effect as an early rapid transfer of 99mTc-DTPA from alveolus to blood. Irrational approaches to background correction may be the main reason why several authorities have concluded that background subtraction causes more error than it corrects. In any event background correction is probably unnecessary for routine measurements, provided the rate constant is based on no more than the first 10 min of data recorded after inhalation. In normal individuals, the clearance rate of 99mTc-DTPA is about 0.01 min -1, or 1% per min. It is, however, about 4% per min in normal cigarette smokers.",

In pigeon fancier's lung, 99mTc-DTPA transfer is abnormal [25] , and shows an increased clearance rate which is proportional to circulating antibody titre. Patients without circulating antibody but with a history of antigen exposure have clearance times faster than normal controls hut not as fast as those with detectable antibody. Pulmonary function tests are often normal in the presence of accelerated clearance rates. Similarly, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis or alveolitis associated with connective tissue diseases [26] is associated with an increase in the transfer rate of 99mTc-DTPA. In cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, serial measurements of 99mTc-DTPA clearance have been used to monitor therapeutic response [27, 28] . Labrune et al. [27] demonstrated that the clearance rate decreased following a positive clinical response to corticosteroids but not down to normal levels. This persistent increase in the clearance rate may be the result of irreversible stretching of lung units by fibrosis. Uh et al. [29] found that in patients with diffuse infiltrative lung disease, clearance rates were significantly fastet in all lobes compared with normal controls hut that, compared with late disease, early stage disease was associated with slower clearance in the upper and middle lobes. There was, however, overlap between the ranges in normals and those with disease such that it was difficult to use the test to identify patients with disease but with normal carbon monoxide transfer values. Thus, although the cle\u00e4rance rate is unlikely to be a diagnostic test, it may be used to monitor therapy and relapse.",

DTPA clearance can demonstrate the location of the main ven-tilatory abnormality before changes in the chest radiograph if there is a focal problem such as lobar pneumonia, segmental infection or pneumonitis. Thus in renal transplant recipients, PCP is associated with a rapid transfer rate of DTPA [38] . These changes, however, would also occur with CMV infection, which is common in transplant recipients, whereas fluid overload or a bacteriopneumonia would not cause significant abnormalities. The clinician can be directed towards a definitive invasive test, such as transbronchial biopsy, or an urgent induced-sputum examination.",

The technique has been used in PCP and other lung infections by a number of groups [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , all of whom have documented a rapid clearance rate. Studies have shown that in alveolitis, the clearance curve is biphasic with a rapid first component (half-time less than 4 min; 12.5% per min). The most likely cause of an alveolitis with this biphasic pattern in HIV-ve patients is still PCP but other causes include CMV infection, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis. The test has a high sensitivity and specificity for PCP in this patient population but false-negative results may occur [42] . Occasionally a biphasic curve is found in heavy smokers with HIV infection in the absence of an alveolitis and it is therefore suggested that baseline scans are obtained in all smokers (authors' experience). Transfer times are generally not biexponential in other bacterial infections with the exception of Legionella pneumophila [41] . Rosso et al. [40] have demonstrated that the DTPA technique has a higher sensitivity than gallium-67 scanning (92% compared with the 72%) for infectious pulmonary complications. This difference is more marked for patients with normal chest radiographs and normal blood gases. The combination of a normal chest radiograph and a normal DTPA clearance virtually excludes pulmonary infection/inflammation significant enough to require therapy. A recent review of DTPA transfer in HIV+ve patients has outlined an algorithm for its use in HIV infection [45] ; this will continue to be of use only while PCP is the most common cause of alveolitis in HIV+ve patients.",

The technique is cheaper than gallium imaging, with less revenue to the department and individuals performing the test. Tbis is unlikely in the current financial climate. 3. The clinician prefers to have definite histological proof and therefore opt for an induced sputum examination or bronchoscopy. The failure rate of induced sputum examination is high, especially in the presence of a normal or near-normal chest radiograph. Bronchoscopy is expensive, invasive and carries a definite risk. It is too expensive to carry out in all patients with a cough and fever, in whom there is a suspicion of PCR The DTPA technique should allow patient selection but the additional cost may not be favoured by the clinician who is capable of performing the bronehoscopy on his/her own patients. 4. Poor education of clinical colleagues by the nuclear medicine physicians. This may be true. 5. Patients with HIV are concentrated in major cities in Europe, the United States and Australia and thus limited numbers of hospitals see large numbers of such patients. Policies will be forged by previous experience and so changing from a technique such as gallium scanning, with which clinicians have become accustomed during the emergence of AIDS in the United States, will be difficult, in spite of the demonstration by Rosso et al. [40] of a higher sensitivity for the detection of lung pathology. 6. The technique is limited to the identification of problems in the lung parenchyma, particularly alveolitis. Certainly, gallium has the advantage that it may demonstrate other pathology in the lung and in lymph nodes. 7. Since the technique has to be made available every day at short notice, it is not compatible with the routine practice of nuclear medicine departments. Busy departments, where the test is likely to be offered, usually make provision for urgent investigations. 8. Clinicians, nurses and technicians are still inherently concerned about the potential infection hazard of HIV+ve patients and will be resistant to a scanning service in this patient group. Further reassurance may be necessary.",
