The cellular antiviral protein ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein) binds CpGs and inhibits HIV-1 replication when CpGs are introduced into the viral genome. However, it is not known if ZAP-mediated restriction is the only mechanism driving CpG suppression. To determine how CpG dinucleotides affect HIV-1 replication, we increased their abundance in multiple regions of the viral genome and analyzed the effect on RNA expression, protein abundance, and infectious-virus production. We found that the antiviral effect of CpGs was not correlated with their abundance. Interestingly, CpGs inserted into some regions of the genome sensitize the virus to ZAP antiviral activity more efficiently than insertions into other regions, and this sensitivity can be modulated by interferon treatment or ZAP overexpression. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the virus to endogenous ZAP was correlated with its sensitivity to the ZAP cofactor KHNYN. Finally, we show that CpGs in some contexts can also inhibit HIV-1 replication by ZAP-independent mechanisms, and one of these is the activation of a cryptic splice site at the expense of a canonical splice site. Overall, we show that the location and sequence context of the CpG in the viral genome determines its antiviral activity. IMPORTANCE Some RNA virus genomes are suppressed in the nucleotide combination of a cytosine followed by a guanosine (CpG), indicating that they are detrimental to the virus. The antiviral protein ZAP binds viral RNA containing CpGs and prevents the virus from multiplying. However, it remains unknown how the number and position of CpGs in viral genomes affect restriction by ZAP and whether CpGs have other antiviral mechanisms. Importantly, manipulating the CpG content in viral genomes could help create new vaccines. HIV-1 shows marked CpG suppression, and by introducing CpGs into its genome, we show that ZAP efficiently targets a specific region of the viral genome, that the number of CpGs does not predict the magnitude of antiviral activity, and that CpGs can inhibit HIV-1 gene expression through a ZAP-independent mechanism. Overall, the position of CpGs in the HIV-1 genome determines the magnitude and mechanism through which they inhibit the virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": ". However, the mechanisms by which CpG dinucleotides attenuate viral replication remain unclear.

CpG dinucleotides are suppressed throughout the HIV-1 genomic RNA (gRNA), and introducing CpGs into gag or env inhibits viral replication (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Furthermore, analysis of clinical HIV-1 samples found that mutations that create new CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 are twice as costly as those that do not and that increased CpG dinucleotide abundance in env may predict disease progression (17, 18) . There are at least four mechanisms by which CpG dinucleotides could inhibit HIV-1. First, CpG DNA methylation-induced transcriptional silencing could repress viral gene expression (12, 13, 19) . Second, introduction of CpGs into cis-acting elements or structures required for viral replication may render them nonfunctional. Third, CpGs could create deleterious cis-acting elements or structures. Fourth, they could act as a pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP) that is recognized by the innate immune system. Supporting the hypothesis that CpGs in viral RNA could be a PAMP, the antiviral protein ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein) has recently been shown to bind regions of HIV-1 RNA containing CpG dinucleotides and to inhibit HIV-1 with increased CpG content in env (16) . ZAP (encoded by the gene ZC3HAV1) was initially discovered as a cellular factor inhibiting murine leukemia virus (MLV) gene expression (20) . Subsequent studies have shown that ZAP also inhibits alphaviruses, filoviruses, and hepadnaviruses, as well as some flaviviruses and picornaviruses (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . ZAP inhibits viral replication by binding viral RNA and targeting it for degradation and/or inhibiting its translation (20, 21, (26) (27) (28) . It may also have other mechanisms of antiviral activity. However, ZAP does not restrict all viruses, and yellow fever virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, herpes simplex virus 1, vesicular stomatitis virus, and poliovirus are resistant to its antiviral activity (21, 24) . ZAP does not have enzymatic activity and interacts with other cellular proteins, such as TRIM25 and KHNYN, to restrict viral replication (29) (30) (31) . Why some viruses are sensitive to ZAP and others are resistant, and whether the CpG abundance and context in viruses determines this, remains unknown.

Because CpGs are highly suppressed in HIV-1, it is an excellent model virus to study the antiviral effects of the dinucleotide. In this study, we introduced CpGs into different contexts and regions of the viral genome and analyzed how they restricted viral gene expression and replication. First, we determined whether there was a position-dependent effect of CpGs on viral replication. Second, we analyzed whether there was a correlation between endogenous ZAP activity and the abundance of CpG dinucleotides. Third, we tested whether increasing ZAP abundance increased its antiviral effect. In sum, we found that CpGs in different contexts and locations inhibited viral gene expression through ZAP-dependent inhibition of gene expression and ZAP-independent changes in pre-mRNA splicing. Importantly, the number of introduced CpG dinucleotides did not predict the magnitude of their antiviral activity or inhibition by endogenous ZAP. ZAP appears to target a specific region in env containing introduced CpGs more efficiently than other regions in the viral genome, though high levels of ZAP can target most regions of the genome containing CpGs. Our results indicate that the context and position of CpG dinucleotides in the HIV-1 genome determine how they inhibit viral replication through ZAP-dependent and -independent mechanisms. previously shown, togaviruses show little CpG suppression, with \u03fe40 CpGs/kb and an observed/expected ratio of \u03fe0. 75 (1-5) .

Furthermore, it is important that the synonymous mutations introducing CpGs do not disrupt RNA elements that regulate viral replication. The HIV-1 open reading frames (ORFs) contain multiple cis-acting regulatory elements, including the programmed ribosomal frameshift sequence in gag (33) ; the Rev response element (RRE) in env (34) ; polypurine tracts in pol and nef (35) ; and splicing signals in pol, vif, vpr, tat, rev, and env (36) .

This analysis identified many of the known HIV-1 linear and structural RNA regulatory elements, including the region at the 5= end of gag required for dimerization and encapsidation, the ribosomal frameshift sequence required for Pol translation, the polypurine tracts required for reverse transcription, several splicing regulatory sequences, and the RRE (Fig. 2B to E; see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material).

An important experimental consideration when studying how CpGs regulate HIV-1 is that CpG DNA methylation-induced transcriptional silencing could potentially inhibit HIV-1 gene expression. However, CpGs in plasmids amplified in bacteria are not methylated when the plasmid is transiently transfected into mammalian cells (38) (39) (40) , and we have therefore used an experimental approach in which HIV-1 proviral DNA plasmids are transfected into HeLa or 293T cells. A region in env immediately after vpu does not contain any detectable cis-acting RNA elements, which makes it a good region to analyze the effect of introducing CpGs ( Fig.  2 ; see Data Set S2). It has previously been shown that introducing 36 CpGs into env nucleotides (nt) 86 to 561 (HIV-1 env86 -561 CpG) inhibits HIV-1 genomic-RNA abundance, Gag expression, Env expression, and infectious-virus production ( Fig. 3A , C, and E and Table 1 ) (16, 31) . Importantly, this restriction is eliminated in ZAP knockout cells (Fig. 3B , C, and E), indicating that it is due to the recognition of the CpG dinucleotides by ZAP. To further characterize how CpGs affect HIV-1 replication, we inserted 48 CpGs into env nt 611 to 1014 (HIV-1 env611-1014 CpG) ( Fig. 3A and Table 1 ) and analyzed their effect on HIV-1 genomic-RNA abundance, Env expression, Gag expression, and infectious-virus production. These CpGs inhibited HIV-1 infectious-virus production more potently than the 36 CpGs in HIV-1 env86 -561 CpG in the control CRISPR cells (Fig. 3C) . However, in the ZAP knockout cells, Gag expression, Env expression, and virion production were only partially increased for HIV-1 env611-1014 CpG, and infectious-virus production was rescued only \u03f32-fold (Fig. 3C ). This indicates that the 48 CpGs introduced into this region of env caused both ZAP-dependent and ZAP-independent suppression of infectious-virus production. Nef is expressed from fully spliced mRNAs that do not contain the env region with the introduced CpGs (36). As expected, the CpGs introduced into HIV-1 env86 -561 CpG did not decrease Nef expression (Fig. 3C) . However, there was decreased Nef expression for HIV-1 env611-1014 CpG, and this was not rescued in the ZAP CRISPR cells. This suggests that another mechanism, such as altered splicing, contributes to the CpGmediated decrease in infectious-virus production for HIV-1 env611-1014 CpG. Furthermore, genomic-RNA abundance for HIV-1 env611-1014 CpG was not fully restored to wild-type levels in ZAP knockout cells, indicating that the CpGs in HIV-1 env611-1014 CpG inhibit genomic-RNA abundance through ZAP-dependent and ZAP-independent mechanisms (Fig. 3E) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 442, "end": 446, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 447, "end": 451, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1034, "text": "(16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1038, "text": "31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 752, "end": 759, "text": "Fig.  2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1004, "text": "Fig. 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1027, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1115, "text": "(Fig. 3B", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1343, "text": "Fig. 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1355, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1628, "text": "(Fig. 3C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1843, "text": "(Fig. 3C", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2212, "text": "(Fig. 3C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2758, "end": 2767, "text": "(Fig. 3E)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "We also combined the two regions in env containing 36 and 48 CpGs for a total of 84 CpGs (HIV-1 env86 -1014 CpG) ( Fig. 3A and Table 1 ).

Therefore, it was important to determine whether ZAP inhibits these viruses, because this could confound the interpretation of results obtained under some experimental conditions. Specifically, we analyzed whether ZAP could restrict HIV-1 containing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by enhanced GFP (eGFP) (IRES-GFP) or Renilla luciferase (IRES-Renilla) ( Fig. 5A and Table 1 ) (41, 42) . Both IRES-GFP and IRES-Renilla introduced 96 CpGs into the viral genome. While both reporter viruses produced less Gag and infectious virus than wild-type HIV-1, ZAP depletion did not increase this production (Fig. 5B ). We also analyzed the effect of a Venus fluorescent protein-plus-inker sequence that introduced 64 CpGs as a fusion protein with Gag ( Fig. 5A and Table 1 ) (43) . Interestingly, this sequence did not sensitize Gag abundance or virus-like particle (VLP) production to ZAP (Fig. 5C ). Because a ribosome could displace ZAP bound to CpGs in an open reading frame as it moves along the mRNA, it is possible that CpGs in a 3= untranslated region (UTR) could inhibit HIV-1 gene expression in a ZAP-dependent manner more effectively than CpGs in a coding region.

Similar to previous reports, this consistently increased expression of the short isoform of ZAP (ZAP-S) by \u03f32-fold and had no substantial effect on expression of the long isoform of ZAP (ZAP-L) ( Fig. 6C ) (44, 45) .

Since the CpGs in the 5= region of gag reduced Env expression in all sequence contexts tested ( Fig. 8E and 9C ), we speculated that they could affect splicing. Therefore, we analyzed RNA abundance when progressively longer regions of codon-optimized gag sequence were added to the virus, which introduced 11, 18, or 26 CpGs (HIV-1 gag22-165 CM, HIV-1 gag22-261 CM, and HIV-1 gag22-378 CM) ( Fig. 10A and Table 1 ). We have previously analyzed these viruses and have shown that they are deficient for genomic-RNA abundance and Gag expression (15) . A comparison of the total RNA and the genomic RNA indicated that the abundance of both was decreased by the synonymous mutations (Fig. 10B) . To determine whether the decrease in viral RNA abundance is due to altered splicing, we used RNA-seq to sequence the transcriptome in each sample and determine which splice sites were used to produce the mRNAs for each virus (Fig. 10C and Table 2 ; see Data Set S3 in the supplemental material). This analysis showed that a preexisting cryptic splice donor (CD1) was activated. Importantly, this donor is outside the region into which the CpGs were introduced (Fig. 10D) . The frequency of use of the cryptic splice donor increased with the length of the codon-optimized gag sequence and coincided with a decrease in the utilization of canonical splice donor 1 (SD1). Activation of the cryptic splice donor increased the length of the first exon incorporated Journal of Virology into all of the spliced viral RNAs to include the gag sequence prior to CD1. This led to the incorporation of the Gag initiation codon in every transcript upstream of the canonical start codon for the encoded protein ( Fig. 10C and D) , which is predicted to result in inefficient translation of all HIV-1 proteins encoded by a singly or fully spliced mRNA, including Tat and Rev.

These CpGs have a dramatic effect on genomic-RNA levels, Gag expression, and Env expression by promoting the use of a cryptic 5= splice donor at the expense of SD1. Interestingly, the magnitude of this effect is modulated by the sequence identity immediately surrounding the CpGs. It should be noted that these experiments were done in the context of transiently transfected proviral constructs in HeLa cells, but previous studies have shown that the splicing patterns for HIV-1 are similar in transfected cells and infected T cells (51, 52) . The introduced CpGs do not directly enhance the strength of this splice site because they are upstream of the splice donor and do not affect the sequence itself. A previous report has identified that introducing synonymous mutations into the 5= end of gag promotes splicing at this cryptic donor, but the role of CpGs in this was not characterized (50) . We found that CpGs introduced into this region have multiple effects on viral replication, including decreases in genomic-RNA stability, Gag expression, virion production, and infectivity per genome (15) . All of these phenotypes are likely due to the decreased use of SD1 and the corresponding increase in splicing from the cryptic splice donor in gag. The CpGs introduced into the 5= end of gag could inhibit a preexisting exonic splicing silencer (ESS) or introduce an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). We favor the hypothesis that the CpGs introduced an ESE, because the synonymous mutations promote splicing at the cryptic splice donor in a length-dependent manner and the sequence within 5 nucleotides surrounding the CpG modulates the magnitude of the decrease in Env and Gag expression. However, further experiments will be required in order to characterize how CpGs modulate splicing. There are approximately 1,500 RNA binding proteins in the human genome, most of which do not have a well-characterized recognition sequence, though several have been reported to bind sequences that contain CpGs (53, 54) . Therefore, an unknown number of RNA binding proteins bind CpGs, and we do not yet know which protein regulates HIV-1 splicing in a CpG-dependent manner. In addition, introducing CpGs into the HIV-1 genome may affect its local or long-range RNA structures; posttranscriptional modifications, such as cytosine methylation; or other aspects of RNA biology (55) (56) (57) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 630, "text": "(51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 631, "end": 634, "text": "52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 985, "end": 989, "text": "(50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1195, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2095, "end": 2099, "text": "(53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2100, "end": 2103, "text": "54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2459, "end": 2463, "text": "(55)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2468, "text": "(56)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2469, "end": 2473, "text": "(57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Surprisingly, the magnitude of ZAP-mediated inhibition was not correlated with the number of CpGs introduced into the viral genome, and some regions of the genome can tolerate substantial numbers of CpGs. Thirty-six CpGs inserted into the 5= region of env had the greatest ZAP-dependent inhibitory phenotype. This corresponds to the observations by Takata et al., who first identified this region in a panel of viruses with large numbers of synonymous mutations in different regions of the HIV-1 genome (16, 50) . The introduction of 53 CpGs into pol or 60 CpGs into the 3= end of gag produced only a small amount of ZAP-dependent inhibition of infectious-virus production. KH-NYN overexpression also produced less inhibition of infectious-virus production when 53 CpGs were introduced into pol than when 36 CpGs were added to env. This supports our hypothesis that KHNYN antiviral activity is controlled by ZAP's ability to target the viral RNA (31) . Only when ZAP levels were very high due to overexpression from a cDNA plasmid did the 53 CpGs in pol mediate a level of repression similar to that mediated by the 36 CpGs introduced into env nt 86 to 561. This highlights the facts that this region in env is very sensitive to the endogenous levels of ZAP in HeLa cells and that the position or local context of the CpG is important for ZAP to inhibit the virus. Interestingly, the weak inhibition of infectious-virus production by the 53 CpGs in pol mediated by endogenous ZAP levels could be substantially enhanced by IFN-I treatment. Therefore, part of the anti-HIV activity mediated by IFN-I (58) may be to promote ZAP targeting CpGs in contexts where it normally does so inefficiently. The fact that there is only a small increase in ZAP-S abundance upon IFN-I treatment raises the question of whether this induction of ZAP is sufficient to explain the phenotype or whether increased abundance or activity of ZAP cofactors, such as TRIM25 or KHNYN, may contribute (29) (30) (31) 59) . Because HiV-1 strains containing reporter genes are commonly used research tools, we investigated whether the large numbers of CpGs in the EMCV IRES, GFP, or Renilla luciferase could sensitize these viruses to ZAP. Adding 96 CpGs to the 3= end of the genome in the context of IRES-GFP or IRES-Renilla luciferase did not sensitize the virus to the endogenous levels of ZAP in HeLa or HEK293T cells. Similarly, HIV-1 with GFP in place of nef has previously been shown not to be targeted by endogenous levels of ZAP in HeLa or MT4 cells (16) . While HIV-1-IRES-GFP and HIV-1-IRES-Renilla were not inhibited by ZAP after IFN-I treatment, they were inhibited when high levels of ZAP were present due to overexpression from a cDNA plasmid. Therefore, ZAP abundance can determine whether CpG-containing viral genomes are targeted, though it is unclear whether the ZAP levels produced from plasmid-based overexpression can be achieved in a relevant in vivo context. This suggests that these reporter viruses are useful tools that may not be affected by ZAP under many experimental conditions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 507, "text": "(16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 508, "end": 511, "text": "50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1975, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1980, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1985, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1989, "text": "59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2530, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "An important area of future research is to determine why CpGs in some contexts or regions are efficiently targeted by ZAP and others are not. To date, the primary evidence that ZAP directly binds CpGs comes from PAR-CLIP experiments (16) . The advantage of this technique is that it captures ZAP binding to CpGs in a living cell. However, other cellular factors present could modulate ZAP's binding specificity. Several groups have shown that the ZAP cofactor TRIM25 can bind cellular and viral RNA, and it has been reported to regulate ZAP binding to Sindbis virus RNA (29, 30, (60) (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) . Therefore, TRIM25 or other ZAP cofactors could bind specific motifs in viral RNA to determine the sensitivity of the RNA to ZAP-mediated antiviral activity. In addition, it is not known how many ZAP molecules are required to bind RNA to mediate antiviral activity or if they have to be clustered in a specific way. While structural and mutagenesis studies of the RNA binding domain in ZAP have shown that it is a dimer that may have two RNA binding cavities within a large RNA binding cleft, how it binds CpG dinucleotides remains unknown (66, 67) .

ZAP has recently been shown to be necessary for introduced CpGs to inhibit the picornavirus echovirus 7 (32). CpGs have also been shown to attenuate influenza A virus and to protect animals from lethal challenge by the wild-type virus (9) . However, the molecular mechanism of attenuation remains unclear, and the CpGs could inhibit via ZAP, altered RNA splicing similar to what we have observed in HIV-1, or other mechanisms. This highlights both a challenge and an opportunity for introducing CpG dinucleotides to create live attenuated vaccines. The multiple mechanisms of action, as well as the position and context dependence of CpG-mediated viral inhibition, pose a challenge to determining the engineering principles for attenuating viruses with a predicted magnitude and mechanism.
