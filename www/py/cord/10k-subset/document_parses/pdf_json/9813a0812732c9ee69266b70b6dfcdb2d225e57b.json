Patient with HIV-related illness are more likely to present with severe TB due to immunosuppression. Very few studies have explored HIV/TB co-infection in critically ill patients. The goal of this study was to analyze factors associated with long-term mortality in critically ill patient with HIV-related disease coinfected with TB. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in an infectious disease reference center in Brazil that included all patient with HIV-related illness admitted to the ICU with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis from March 2007 until June 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed based on six-month survival. Results: Forty-four patients with HIV-related illness with a confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis were analyzed. The six-month mortality was 52 % (23 patients). The main causes of admission were respiratory failure (41 %), severe sepsis/septic shock (32 %) and coma/torpor (14 %). The median time between HIV diagnosis and ICU admission was 5 (1-60) months, and 41 % of patients received their HIV infection diagnosis \u2264 30 days before admission. The median CD4 count was 72 (IQR: 23-136) cells/mm 3 . The clinical presentation was pulmonary tuberculosis in 22 patients (50 %) and disseminated TB in 20 patients (45.5 %). No aspect of TB diagnosis or treatment was different between survivors and nonsurvivors. Neurological dysfunction was more prevalent among nonsurvivors (43 % vs. 14 %, p = 0.04).

The score varies from 0 to 163 points, and the higher the SAPS II value, the less is the probability of survival.

It classifies a range of six organ dysfunctions: cardiovascular (hypotension or use of vasopressors); respiratory (PaO2/FiO2 rate); neurological (Glasgow Coma Scale); renal (serum creatinine level and/or daily diuresis); hepatic (serum bilirubin level); and hematological (platelets level). The score goes from 0 to 24 points, and it can be calculated on a daily basis, in order to evaluate the patient's improvement or worsening. SOFA also gives qualitative information about the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). For ease of interpretation, we also evaluated the initial SOFA score (day 1), since one score higher than 11 points is associated with less than 20 % chance of survival [20] .

As immunosuppression evolves, the TB disease spectrum changes from its classic pulmonary presentation of unilateral upper lobe infiltrate to a broad range of nonspecific signs and symptoms related to hematogenic spread of the bacillus. The myriad of presentations of TB in the population with HIV-related disease is associated with challenges in establishing the diagnosis and higher mortality [33] . Our high proportion of disseminated TB (45 %) is due to the advanced immunodeficiency status of our population, with median CD4 cell counts of 72 cells/mm 3 , which were lower than previously reported (109 and 112 CD4 cells/mm 3 ) [28, 29] . CD4 cell count is thought to be an unreliable predictor of ICU mortality, according to Morris and colleagues, when compared to other known risk factors, such as mechanical ventilation, low serum albumin and APACHE II score [11, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, others authors believe that CD4 cell count does have a correlation with a poorer prognosis [25, [38] [39] [40] . Low CD4 counts (<200 cells/mm 3 ) have been associated with ICU mortality in HIV patients with TB [41] . In the present study, we found that patients with higher nadir CD4 cell counts were more likely to be alive six months after hospital discharge. These data are supported by the idea that CD4 cell counts at ICU admission are a better marker of long-term prognosis [42] . We preferred nadir than recent CD4 cell count because opportunistic infections and concomitant acute infections can lower the CD4 cell count [45] . Alongside with the low nadir CD4 cell count, we wanted to emphasize that we also observed a low median CD4 count close to ICU admission meaning that our population represents a profoundly immunocompromised population. Also, nadir CD4 cell count it is better marker of prognosis and disease evolution in HIV infected population [43, 44] . We also found Fig. 2 Kaplan-Meier plot of six-month survival in critically ill patients with HIV-related disease and tuberculosis, based on nadir CD4 cell count less than 50 cells/mm 3 . Log-rank test p = 0.006 that recent HIV diagnosis was associated with protective effect for long term survival. This variable should be evaluated with caution: there is not an accurate correlation of the moment of first HIV positive serology and the time since HIV infection began. Some patients are admitted with recent HIV diagnosis and very low nadir CD4 count, although they were previously less exposed to bacterial and multilple oportunistic infections and to the HIV infection per se, than their peers with long known HIV diagnosis and non-adherence to cART.

This may be different from another study, which enrolled 46 HIV-TB patients, including suspected cases of TB, although we included only confirmed cases [10] . Finally, improvements in the care of critically ill patients, such as implementation of protective ventilator strategies with low tidal volume, conservative fluid strategy for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and early sepsis goals, have added benefits and have recently had an impact on lower mortality rates [28, 34, 55] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 200, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 201, "end": 204, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 205, "end": 208, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 840, "end": 843, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 844, "end": 847, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Risk factors for long-term mortality"}, {"text": "This study highlights neurological dysfunction as being an important marker for mortality among critically ill HIV-TB patients.
