Patients & methods: Generalized estimating equations analyses were performed to determine the genetic influence in parasitemia and/or gametocytemia clearance over treatment time in 164 patients. Results: An effect of CYP2C8 low-activity alleles on treatment was observed (p = 0.01).

In the present study, CYP2C8reduced activity alleles carriers showed lower rates of gametocyte elimination as compared with homo zygous wild-type allele *1A. CYP2C8*4 is a missense mutation, which promotes a lower enzyme activity in vitro than the wild-type allele *1A, and similarly CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3 also present a markedly decrease activity in vitro [36, 37] . In Africa, CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3 were associated with impaired meta bolism of the antimalarial amodiaquine while CYP2C8*4 was not identified [38] . CYP2C9-reduced activity allele carriers also showed a lower gametocytemia clearance rate during treatment period, although not significant after Bonferroni correction. CYP2C9 was not related to CQ or PQ metabolism, however, linkage disequilibrium between CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 alleles was already reported in the admixed Brazilian population where those genes constitute a haplotypic block [39] . Linkage disequilibrium or an overlap of these enzyme func-tions are possible explanations for the trend observed in CQ/PQ treatment outcome.

CQ has a major effect as schizontocides in erythrocytes, but is also effective against P. vivax gametocytes. PQ has major effect as gametocytocide and hypno zoitocide in liver and is not metabolized by those CYPs isoenzymes. Besides CYP2C8 alleles were associated with slow gametocytemia clearance in CQ/PQ-associated regimen, the effect of PQ probably was sufficient to reach an adequate gametocyte clearance for all patients after 4 days of treatment.
