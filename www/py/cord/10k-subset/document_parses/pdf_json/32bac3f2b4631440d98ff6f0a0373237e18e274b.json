By using clearly delineated endpoints, these models helped convince donors and the scientific community that the aims of the program were achievable [14] . As a result, mathematical models have retained a role in subsequent policy discussions [15] . Insights from mathematical models during the SARS epidemic helped determine how serious the epidemic might become, as well as the impact of proposed control measures. These models provided important guidance to public-health authorities at a critical time when little other information was available. Insights from the models showed that, if unchecked, the virus could cause a significant epidemic, but that basic epidemiological control measures -patient isolation, contact tracing, etc -could have a substantial impact on the extent of the epidemic. Subsequently, these control measures played a major role in limiting the spread of the 2003 epidemic [16] .",

Complex mediating models which themselves have explanatory power and which embody techniques of modeling can be refined and passed down to successor models [9] .

The technology allowed for interactive discussion, so speakers in Toronto faced questions from Second Life \u00ae participants all around the world, while Second Life \u00ae speakers had their Powerpoint presentations shown on a screen in Toronto (operated by their avatars in Second Life \u00ae and simultaneously by the organisers in Toronto), and faced questions from Toronto and other Second Life \u00ae participants. The size of the turnout in Second Life \u00ae demonstrated the effectiveness of virtual conferencing; many more people were able to attend the conference than would have been feasible otherwise.",
