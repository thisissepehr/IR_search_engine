Exchange transfusion is indicated in patients who are transfused chronically in order to prevent or delay the onset of iron-overload. Acute chest syndrome is the most common form of organ failure and its management should be agressive, including adequate ventilation, multiple antibacterials and simple or exchange blood transfusion depending on its severity.",

The sickle mutation is the result of a single base change (GAT \u2192 GTT) in the sixth codon of exon 1 of the \u03b2-globin gene responsible for the synthesis of the \u03b2-globin polypeptide of the Hb molecule (\u03b1 2 \u03b2 2 ). This change, in turn, results in replacement of the normal glutamic acid with valine at position 6 of the \u03b2-globin chain and the formation of sickle Hb. [6, 7] In a sense, the mutation is akin to a typographical Table I . Beneficial effects of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell anaemia Decreases the frequency of acute painful episodes Decreases the incidence of acute chest syndrome Decreases the blood transfusion requirement Decreases morbidity and mortality error where a change of one letter of a keyword of a manuscript ('punctuation mutation') corrupts the meaning of the intended message. Typographical errors in articles, however, are episodic and have a transient effect that is effaced with time. The sickle mutation, on the hand, is permanent and often afflicts a life with pain, disability and morbid existence.",

The first mechanism is the KCl co-transport pathway activated by acidification and cell swelling. [15] [16] [17] This pathway is most active in reticulocytes and is a feature of low-density sickle cells (Reversibly Sickled Cells -RSC). Reticulocyte dehydration appears to contribute to the generation of dense sickle cells directly without going through repetitive cycles of oxygenation-deoxygenation. [18] The second transport system that mediates cellular dehydration is the Ca 2+ -activated potassium channel or the Gardos pathway, which seems to be activated by Ca 2+ reflux-induced deoxygenation. [15] [16] [17] [19] [20] [21] Although much of the intracellular Ca 2+ in sickle cells is sequestered in endocytic ves-icles, [22] [23] [24] transient reflux of Ca 2+ during deoxygenation-induced sickling seems to be responsible for stimulating the Gardos pathway. Unlike the KCl co-transport, the Gardos pathway seems to be most active in the dense fraction of sickle cell anaemia RBCs. However, in most patients both transport systems are operative.",

Sickle RBC adhere to cultured endothelial cells in vitro under both static and dynamic conditions whereas normal cells do not. [25] [26] [27] [28] These findings suggest that sickle RBC have sticky surfaces that promote their attachment to monolayers of cultured endothelial cells. These in vitro observations have been documented to also occur in ex vivo perfusion studies in rats [29] and transgenic mice. [30] Both cellular and plasma factors have been reported to affect adhesion of sickle RBC to vascular endothelium. Thus, young deformable sickle RBC appear to be more adherent to vascular endothelium than are dense, rigid, irreversibly sickled cells. [28, 31, 32] Two receptors, \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 and CD36 are present on sickle cell anaemia RBC. The former has been shown to play a role in the adherence of sickle RBC to endothelial cells via vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1. [33, 34] Plasma factors that enhance adhesion include fibrinogen, factor VIII, fibronectin, hyperosmolality, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin and microparticles from activated platelets. [28, 31, 32, [35] [36] [37] [38] Thrombospondin released from activated platelets bridges the gap between endothelial cells and sickle RBC by binding to CD36 receptors on the former and CD36 receptor or sulfated glycan on the latter. [39, 40] Matsui et al., [41] have recently reported that when endothelial cells are activated, P-selectin, a glue-like molecule, moves from their intracellular environment to their outer surface where it binds to sickle cells. This is a novel finding that sheds new light on the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. Previous studies (vide infra) showed that activated P-selectin triggers clotting in platelets and helps leucocytes to adhere to endothelial cells, and they assumed that RBC did not bind directly to Pselectin. Matsui et al. [41] presented the first evidence that P-selectin binds to normal RBC and, to a greater extent, to sickle RBC. This finding suggests that inhibition of P-selectin should be considered as a novel approach for the treatment of acute sickle cell painful episodes.",

Evidence of reperfusion injury includes: (i) inflammatory response in the vascular bed of the transgenic mouse with increased leucocyte rolling, adhesion and emigration after 3 hours of mild hypoxia followed by reperfusion; (ii) local production of free radicals; and (iii) the complete inhibition of (i) and (ii) after the infusion of a monoclonal murine anti-P-selectin antibody, but not an anti-REselectin antibody, before reoxygenation. [45] The implication of this sequence of events is that restoration of oxygen to ischaemic tissue results in the generation of free radicals associated with inflammatory endothelial and tissue injury.",

The former MAb (73E) inhibits both \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 and glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa that bind primarily to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. LM-609, on the other hand, selectively inhibits \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 . Infusion of washed sickle cell anaemia RBC in the ex vivo mesocecum of the rat, pretreated with PAF, with or without a control antibody resulted in extensive adhesion of sickle RBC in venules associated with post-capillary blockage. Pre-treatment of the vasculature with either 73E or LM-609, but not with control antibody, inhibited the adhesion of sickle RBC in postcapillary venules. Whether the same sequence of events occurs in patients with sickle cell anaemia or not awaits carefully designed clinical trials with antibodies that inhibit the interaction of sickle RBC and endothelial cells.",

Available data suggest that treatment with these MAb after the onset of vaso-occlusion may not be effective. The abnormally high base-line leucocyte count both in patients with sickle cell anaemia and in the sickle transgenic mouse seems to be a marker of this proposed chronic inflammatory state of sickle cell anaemia.

Generally speaking, \u03b1 gene deletion is associated with milder anaemia, [52] and hence fewer complications associated with severe anaemia and less blood transfusion. The increased haemoglobin level associated with \u03b1 gene deletion, however, increases the blood viscosity, which is often accompanied by increased frequency of painful crises [53, 54] and vaso-occlusive episodes such as avascular necrosis. [55, 56] The effect of \u03b1 gene deletion on the clinical picture is best illustrated in patients with sickle cell anaemia with two \u03b1 gene deletions (\u03b2 s /\u03b2 s , -\u03b1/-\u03b1). Table III lists the unique features of this type of sickle cell anaemia. [57] [58] [59] [60] Noteworthy is that hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2) is elevated in sickle cell anaemia with two \u03b1 gene deletions, a finding that confuses this diagnosis with S-\u03b2-thalassemia that is typically also associated with elevated Hb A2 levels. This clinical picture, family history, haematological data and molecular diagnostics can differentiate the two diagnoses. [59] \u03b2-haplotypes refer to the nucleotide sequence 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the sickle gene. Three major types have been described in Africans and African-Americans. [61] These are the Senegalese (Sen), Benin (Ben) and Central African Republic (CAR) haplotypes. The significance of these haplotypes pertains to their effect on Hb F production. It has been established that the higher the Hb F level, the milder is the sickle cell anaemia. [54] The Sen haplotype, especially in the homozygous state, is associated with relatively high Hb F levels and, hence, milder disease. [50, 62] However, these conclusions are based on population data and may not apply to an individual patient.",

Moreover, Hb F seems to affect the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of RBC and coagulation activation. In vivo cycles of sickling/ unsickling with resulting membrane changes and microvesicle formation are one factor responsible for phosphatidylserine exposure.

Nociceptive sickle cell pain, typically, is sharp and/or throbbing in nature. Pain that is burning, shooting, lancinating or tingling in nature suggests the presence of a neuropathic component of pain that entails the utilisation of certain adjuvants as will be discussed in this section. [71, 72] Initial pain assessment establishes a baseline against which the effectiveness of analgesics in achieving pain relief can be compared. Subsequent assessment allows increasing the dose of analgesics to achieve desirable pain relief, tapering the dose of analgesics as the painful episode resolves, identification of adverse effects of therapy or the emergence of complications of the disease which allow intervention to modify the treatment plan as needed.",

They act primarily at the level of nociceptors where pain impulses originate and, hence, are often referred to as peripherally acting analgesics. They exert their analgesic effect by decreasing the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting COX enzymes, [78] thus, decreasing or abolishing the sensitisation of nociceptors by prostanoids. The traditional non-selective NSAIDs inhibit both the housekeeping COX-1 and the inducible COX-2 enzymes. Selective NSAIDs inhibit only the COX-2 enzyme and spare COX-1, which is needed to produce physiological levels of prostaglandins.",

They should not be administered to patients with renal disease or with history of peptic ulcer disease. It is advisable not to administer them continuously to patients with sickle cell disease for more than 5 days. Moreover, certain NSAIDs are associated with idiosyncratic (non-prostaglandin-mediated) reactions as shown in table VII. Most recent among these is immune thrombocytopenia resulting from sensitivity to metabolites of naproxen and paracetamol. [81] The antibodies described were mostly specific for GP IIb/IIIa and less often to GP Ib/IX/V. COX-2 inhibitors are associated with significantly less gastrointestinal and haemostatic adverse effects [79, 80] than the non-selective NSAIDs, but their effect on renal function seems to be the same. [82, 83] The concomitant administration of ketorolac with opioids was reported to exert an additional analgesic effect and decrease the amount of opioids consumed for the treatment of acute painful episodes. [84] Tramadol [85] is a synthetic centrally acting analgesic not chemically related to opioids. It acts as a weak agonist with preferential affinity to the \u03bc receptors. Moreover, it inhibits neuronal re-uptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, and stimulates the release of serotonin. Thus, functionally, it has properties of an opioid and an antidepressant. The initial enthusiasm that this drug is not associated with clinically significant respiratory depression or addiction potential [85] waned after reports indicating that seizures may be an adverse effect and an increasing abuse potential. Currently, tramadol is not a scheduled drug and it seems to be as effective as paracetamol with 30mg codeine with the added advantage of a tricyclic antidepres-sant-like effect. Tramadol may be administered by the oral or parenteral route, and it is available in slow-release form. Only the oral form is approved for marketing in the US at the present. Anecdotally, tramadol seems to be effective in the management of mild or moderately severe pain in some patients with sickle cell anaemia.",

            "text": "Opioid agonists are most often used in the management of sickle cell pain, especially in adults. They decrease or modify the perception of pain at the level of the central nervous system (CNS). They exert their effect by binding to \u03bc, \u03ba, and to a lesser extent, \u03b4 receptors. [86] Opioid agonists can be administered via several routes (orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, transdermally, etc.) and methods, including continuous intravenous drip, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump or intermittent injection. Pethidine (meperidine), morphine and hydromorphone are the major opioid analgesics used in the treatment of severe pain in the Emergency Department (ED) and hospital. Long-acting opioids, such as the oxycodone controlled-release (CR) formulation Oxy-Contin \u00ae1 (oxycodone CR) and morphine CR, are useful in the management of chronic pain and in combination with short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain. Adverse effects of opioid analgesics include itching, nausea, vomiting, sedation and respiratory depression. Seizures may be associated with op-ioids, especially with the prolonged use of pethidine, in some patients. Tolerance and physical dependence occur in some patients, but addiction is rare. [71] As a group, opioid analgesics have no ceiling effect (with the possible exception of codeine) and hence, the only limiting factor for dosage is adverse effects. Severe sedation and respiratory depression are the most important adverse effects. Hospitalised patients receiving opioid analgesics on a regular basis should be monitored for their respiratory rate and sedation level. A respiratory rate less than 10 per min and/or severe sedation justifies missing, decreasing or delaying the dose, or discontinuing the opioid in question until the depressive effects disappear. Opioid analgesics should be used carefully in patients with impaired ventilation, asthma, increased intracranial pressure and liver failure. The dosage of pethidine and morphine should be adjusted in the presence of renal failure. They are also histaminergic and histamine release may trigger bronchospasm or initiate an allergic reaction. Morphine is the most histaminergic of all opioids. [88] The presence of paracetamol in combination with codeine or oxycodone limits the daily dose that can be safely used so that the maximum allowable dosage of paracetamol is not exceeded. The use of paracetamol in conjunction with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause a severe adverse reaction characterised by excitation, hyperpyrexia, convulsions and death. [89] The co-administration of antipsychotics with pethidine may cause neuromuscular disorders including akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. [90] Adjuvants include antihistamines, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and anti-convulsants. These are heterogeneous compounds that potentiate the analgesic effect of opioids, ameliorate their adverse effects and have their own mild analgesic effect. The most commonly used adjuvants in the management of sickle cell pain are listed in table IX. The role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in sickle cell anaemia is not clear at the present. Adjuvants must be used with care and patients should be monitored carefully when receiving them. Adjuvants also have adverse effects, some of which precipitate or worsen some of the manifestations of sickle cell anaemia as is discussed later in this section. [71] Acute painful episodes of mild or moderate severity are usually treated at home using a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities. Home treatment of pain usually follows the three step analgesic ladder proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). [91] Mild pain is treated with non-pharmacologic agents alone or in combination with a non-opioid. More severe pain entails the addition of an opioid \u00b1 an adjuvant. Data from the Multi-center Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) [3, 4] in sickle cell anaemia showed that a oxycodone/paracetamol formulation was the opioid most often used for the home treatment of pain. [92] However, this report was before the advent of the new formulations of opioids such as oxycodone CR. Whether oxycodone/paracetamol continues to be the first in this scenario of pain management remains to be seen.",

These findings should encourage other metropolitan hospitals in cities with a large population of African-Americans to follow suit by establishing acute care facilities specifically designed for patients with sickle cell disease.

Specific indications for blood transfusion are listed in table X. [94] [95] [96] The goal of exchange transfusion is to increase or maintain a Hb level of about 10g% and to decrease the level of sickle Hb to <30%. [97, 98] In patients with stroke undergoing exchange transfusion to prevent recurrence of a cerebrovascular accident, a level of sickle Hb <50% seems to be acceptable. [96, 99] However, there are no controlled studies to show which target of sickle Hb is better in relief of the acute symptoms and prevention of recurrence. More blood units may be needed to decrease sickle Hb to <30% and thus, more exposure of the patient to donor blood. On the other hand, decreasing sickle Hb to <50% only may increase the fre-quency of blood exchanges required to keep sickle Hb at this level.",

            "text": "Blood selected for transfusion for patients with sickle cell anaemia should meet the criteria listed in table XI. Because the majority of patients with sickle cell anaemia are Africans or African-Americans and because they receive blood given by Caucasians, there is a high incidence of allo-immunisation in transfused patients with sickle cell anaemia. [95] The most prevalent allo-antibodies in patients with sickle cell anaemia include anti-C, -E and -K. Thus, the use of phenotypically matched blood, at least for these antigens, is highly recom- mended. [100] Some blood banks implemented programs to increase communication between the African-American community and medical facilities to ensure the presence of a blood supply from African-American donors directed for patients with sickle cell anaemia in order to reduce the incidence of allo-immunisation to those antigens that are prevalent in African-Americans. However, there are no data to show the desirable outcome, if any, of this practice. One concern about this practice (designated donations from African-Americans to patients with sickle cell anaemia) is that it may increase the incidence of transfusion-related graft versus host disease unless such blood is routinely irradiated. Some of the complications seen in patients with sickle cell anaemia are secondary to therapeutic interventions. Table XII lists some of these complications. Patients transfused before 1992, when a reliable second generation screening test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) was introduced in blood banks, are at a higher risk for transmission of HCV. Approximately 20 to 25% of adult patients who received a blood transfusion before 1992 are positive for HCV antibody. These patients should be followed-up regularly and the levels of hepatic enzymes monitored periodically. Increase in the enzyme level beyond what is expected in sickle cell disease is an indication for a liver biopsy. If the latter shows evidence of hepatitis, specific therapy with a combination of interferon and ribavirin [101] would be considered. Patients with sickle cell anaemia taking ribavirin should be monitored carefully because ribavirin may worsen their haemolytic anaemia. [102] The transfusion of leucocyte-reduced components decreases the chances for allo-immunisation and febrile transfusion reactions. The transfusion of phenotypically identical RBC also minimises the chances for allo-immunisation and haemolytic reactions. Iron overload is best monitored by periodic determination of serum ferritin levels in frequently transfused patients. [103] Serum ferritin levels >1500 \u03bcg/L in the steady state are suggestive of iron overload. To confirm the diagnosis of iron overload, a liver biopsy is indicated in order to quantitate the amount of iron per gram of tissue. Hepatic iron concentration >10 mg/g liver dry weight is diagnostic of iron overload and is an indication for chelation therapy with deferoxamine.",

Several acquired abnormalities render patients with sickle cell disease immunocompromised and hence susceptible to a number of infections that are a major cause of mortality and morbidity. These include immunomodulation secondary to blood transfusion and iron overload. [103] The increased susceptibility of patients to infection with polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae) is secondary to absence of splenic function. Cellular immunity may be compromised by transfusion-related iron overload and abnormalities in B cell immunity may explain antigen processing defects. Infections due to Escherichia coli are usually associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in adult patients. Patients with sickle cell anaemia are susceptible to osteomyelitis secondary to Salmonella typhimurium in addition to the usual causes of bacterial osteomyelitis such as Staphylococcus aureus.

Microaneurysms (commonly referred to as moya moya) involving fragile dilated vessels that develop as compensatory collateral circulation around areas of infarction seem to be responsible for haemorrhage in adults (figure 2). Unlike other vascular beds, large vessels rather than microvessels seem to be the site of occlusion with consequent infarction. Approximately twothirds of children with cerebral infarction (who are not transfused) may develop further ischaemic events within 3 years [9, 107] A major breakthrough in the management of CNS complications in children has been the prevention of stroke in patients at risk for this complication. [108, 109] Specifically blood transfusion prevented the occurrence of stroke in children who had abnormal results on transcranial doppler ultra-sonography (TCD).

Whether chronic transfusion therapy for adults with cerebral infarction secondary to vaso-occlusion is indicated or not remains unknown. Similarly, the appropriate treatment of an adult patient with cerebral haemorrhage has yet to be determined. A thorough search for aneurysms should be made and surgical intervention considered. Ware et al. [110] have recently suggested that some children with sickle cell disease and stroke may discontinue chronic transfusion and use hydroxyurea therapy to prevent stroke recurrence.

            "text": "Charache et al. [112] introduced the term acute chest syndrome to define acute episodes of fever, chest pain, increased leukocytosis and pulmonary infiltrates in adult patients with sickle cell anaemia, most of whom probably had pulmonary infarction. With time, the definition of acute chest syndrome has expanded to include hypoxemia, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chills and worsening anaemia. [113] Moreover, the current definition of acute chest syndrome stresses that the infiltrates must be 'new'. The signs and symptoms of acute chest syndrome vary from very mild to very severe and even life-threatening. Another feature of acute chest syndrome that is not included in the definition is the presence of blister cells in peripheral blood. [114] Acute chest syndrome is second to acute painful episodes as the most common cause of hospitalisation of patients with sickle cell disease and also the most common complication of surgery and anaesthesia. [115] Acute chest syndrome is the most common cause of death and is closely associated with acute painful episodes especially in adults. [116, 117] Although acute chest syndrome is usually self-limited and resolves with treatment, it can be associated with respiratory failure with a mortality rate of about 1.8% in children and 4.8% in adults. [118, 119] Risk factors for developing acute chest syndrome are listed in table XIV. [120] The incidence of acute chest syndrome is highest in sickle cell anaemia, followed by S-\u03b2 0 -thalassemia, Hb SC disease and S-\u03b2 + -thalassemia in decreasing order of frequency. The single most important preventive factor is a high level of Hb F due either to endogenous genetic factors or to exogenous induction with drugs such as hydroxyurea. [3, [121] [122] [123] [124] The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of RBCs, platelet count and \u03b1-thalassemia bear no relation to acute chest syndrome. [120] Aetiologies of acute chest syndrome include infection, especially communityacquired pneumonia, pulmonary infarction as a result of in situ sickling, fat-bone marrow embolism or pulmonary embolism. Infection is commonly caused by chlamydia, mycoplasma, respiratory syncytial virus, coagulase-positive S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma hominis, parvovirus and rhinovirus in decreasing order of frequency. [118] Adhesion of sickled RBC to endothelial cells of small or medium-sized pulmonary vessels may result in occlusion of microvascular flow and consequent pulmonary infarction. [39, 124, 125] This sequence of events is supported by dynamic imaging studies but confirmatory clinical data are not available. Pulmonary thromboembolism is uncommon as a cause of acute chest syndrome despite the presence of a hypercoagulable state in sickle cell disease. [126] It seems that this hypercoagulable state plays a more important role in stimulating cellular adhesion and activating the inflammatory system than in initiating the thrombotic cascade. [29, 127] Pulmonary fat-bone marrow embolism (figure 3) in patients with sickle cell anaemia appears to be more common than previously thought. [120, 126] The characteristic clinical picture is that of severe bone pain, usually in long bones, followed by dyspnea, hypoxia and fever. Tissue infarction of the bone marrow within the long bones seems to generate a source of fat and necrotic tissue that has been demonstrated on autopsy. At the same time, serum levels of secretory phospholipase A2, (sPLA2), an inflammatory mediator, increase in patients with acute chest syndrome [128] and liberate free fatty acids from membrane phospholipids of damaged tissue that are believed to cause damage to pulmonary endothelium culminating in a leak syndrome which, if severe, may be similar to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An elevated level of sPLA2 is both a marker and probably a predictor of acute chest syndrome.",

The diagnosis of fat embolism entails the identification of fat-laden macrophages in induced deep sputum, or better bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained by bronchoscopy. [119, 126] Blister cells have been described in the peripheral blood of patients with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome. [114] Management of acute chest syndrome includes oxygen, incentive spirometry, antibacterials, simple blood transfusion or exchange transfusion, judicious use of analgesics, careful hydration and possibly vasodilators. Incentive spirometry prevents splinting and atelectasis, and may actually prevent acute chest syndrome in patients who have rib infarction. [129] Intravenous antibacterials are indicated since it is difficult to rule out pneumonia or infected lung infarcts. A combination of a third generation cephalosporin and a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone (table XIII) should be used to cover typical and atypical pathogens. Simple transfusion or exchange transfusion is indicated in patients with worsening respiratory function. The beneficial effects of blood transfusion may not be due simply to decreasing the proportion of sickled RBC and other mechanisms may be involved. These include: (i) an immunomodulatory mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines [interleukin(IL)-8, in particular] bind to the Duffy antigen present on transfused RBCs, but often absent on RBCs of African-Americans; [130] and (ii) the albumin that is present in transfused units or used in blood exchange may bind free fatty acids, thus neutralising their damaging effect on the pulmonary endothelium.",

This recommendation should be considered carefully. Opioids have a few systemic adverse effects, and careful monitoring of their use ensures their safety. They should be discontinued if the respiratory rate is \u226410 per minute and their adverse effects can be quickly reversed with opioid antagonists. NSAIDs, on the other hand, have considerable systemic adverse effects that may not be readily obvious. NSAIDs decrease the levels of prostaglandins and prostacyclin, prostanoids that are essential in modulating the vascular tone of smooth muscle and renal blood flow. Thus, NSAIDs may worsen the clinical picture of acute chest syndrome as a result of vasocontrictive effects.",

Another recent investigational approach to treat acute chest syndrome includes the use of purified poloxamer 188, which is a non-ionic surfactant. It is hypothesised that this agent reduces blood viscosity, prevents adhesion of RBCs to vascular endothelium and improves microvascular blood flow. [134, 135] Because acute chest syndrome is relatively frequent in patients with sickle cell anaemia, and in view of the need to monitor arterial blood gases in its management, it is important to establish baseline blood gases and pulmonary function tests for all patients. These determinations will be of value in evaluating patients who present with acute onset of pulmonary signs and symptoms.",

The increased frequency of UTI in sickle cell anaemia may relate to renal infarction or to immunodeficiency. The hypoxic, acidotic and hypertonic environment of the renal medulla causes sickling of the RBC in the vasa recta and leads to infarction of the renal medulla, hyposthenuria and haematuria (gross or microscopic). Inability to acidify the urine after an acid load can also occur. These renal tubular defects (haematuria, hyposthenuria) occur not only in patients homozygous for the sickle gene, but also in patients who are heterozygous (for example, AS, SC, SD and SO).",

            "text": "Nephrotic syndrome, with or without hypertension, occurs frequently. Microscopic haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension and the nephrotic syndrome are markers of incipient end-stage renal failure. Proteinuria occurs in 25% of patients with sickle cell anaemia and elevated serum creatinine levels in approximately 7%. Proteinuria causes congestion of tubular endothelium as a result of tubular uptake of protein. Congestion induces growth factors which, in turn, lead to proliferation of fibroblasts that culminate in renal fibrosis and renal failure. The pathological lesion is usually glomerular enlargement and peripheral focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Treatment with enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) seems to reduce the degree of proteinuria in patients with sickle cell anaemia suggesting that capillary hypertension may be a pathogenic factor in sickle cell nephropathy. Once chronic renal failure sets in, patients require long-term haemodialysis and are candidates for kidney transplantation. [9, 10, 71] Priapism occurs when sickle cells congest the copora and prevent emptying of blood from the penis. It can result from tricorporal involvement (both of the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum) or bicorporal involvement (both corpora cavernosa). The latter is more common, especially in children, and is not regularly associated with impotence. There are two major clinical presentations of priapism: acute and chronic. [141] The acute presentation is characterised by a prolonged painful erection that persists beyond several hours, responds poorly to exchange transfusion and frequently requires surgical intervention. Acute priapism may be followed by complete or partial impotence. The chronic form of priapism is characterised by repetitive, reversible, painful erections called 'stuttering' priapism. It usually occurs after intercourse or it may awaken patients early in the morning. Stuttering priapism responds well to diazepam or pseudoephedrine. Patients who become impotent may benefit from psychological counselling and the insertion of penile implants. A practical and relatively simple approach to manage outpatients with priapism has been recently reported. [127] Specifically, aspiration of the corpora cavernosa followed by irrigation with a dilute epinephrine solution was effective in producing detumescence in most patients. Patients who do not respond to this approach are potential candidates for exchange transfusion and/or surgery. [142] Leg Ulcers Leg ulceration is a painful and sometimes disabling complication of sickle cell anaemia that occurs in 5 to 10% of adult patients. Severe pain may necessitate the use of opioid analgesics. Leg ulcers are more common in males and older patients, and less common in patients with \u03b1-gene deletion, high total Hb level or high levels of Hb F. [57] Leg ulcers seem to be more common in patients who are also carriers of the CAR \u03b2-gene cluster haplotype. [143] Treatment of leg ulcers includes wound care using wet to dry dressings soaked in saline or Burrow's solution. With good localised treatment, many ulcers heal within a few months. Leg ulcers that persist beyond 6 months may require blood transfusion or skin grafting, although results of the latter treatment have been disappointing. Because leg ulcers may recur after minimal trauma, protec-tive legging with non-elastic (special velcro) lower-extremity orthoses with ankle straps, to be worn during working hours, appears to be an effective preventive measure. [144] Principles of management of leg ulcers include education, protection, infection control, debridement and compression bandages. Efficacy of blood transfusion/exchange transfusion, hyperbaric oxygen and skin grafting is anecdotal in nature. Osteomyelitis may complicate chronic leg ulcers, especially those associated with deep wounds, and it is advisable to rule out this complication with a bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with gadolinium as needed. To date, there has been no controlled trial of the treatment of sickle cell leg ulcers to identify the best approach to management.",

The limited terminal arterial blood supply and the paucity of collateral circulation make these three areas especially vulnerable to sickling and subsequent bone damage. Patients with sickle cell anaemia and \u03b1-gene deletion have a higher incidence of avascular necrosis because the relatively high hematocrit increases blood viscosity and thus, enhances microvasculopathy in the aforementioned anatomic sites. [55, 56] The MCV and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are negatively correlated with avascular necrosis. [56] Medical treatment of avascular necrosis is symptomatic and includes providing non-opioid and/or opioid analgesics for pain relief, as well as minimal weight bearing. Advanced forms of the disease require total bone replacement. Core decompression (figure 4) in the management of avascular necrosis appears to be effective if done in the early stages of avascular necrosis. [149] Results of hip arthroplasty in patients with sickle cell anaemia are not as encouraging as results of arthroplasty performed for an arthritic hip. [150] Placement of an internal prosthesis may be difficult owing to the presence of hard sclerotic bone in patients with sickle cell anaemia. Other problems associated with hip arthroplasty in these patients include an increased incidence of infection, [151, 152] a failure rate of about 50% and a high morbidity due to loosening of both cemented and uncemented prosthesis. Recent techniques of arthroplasty may improve the life expectancy of hip prostheses.",

At least two-thirds of patients with sickle cell anaemia have hepatomegaly and 75% have cholelithiasis. About 90% of patients with cholelithiasis undergo cholecystectomy either prophylactically or after an episode of acute calculus cholecystitis. Most cholecystectomies are currently performed by laparoscopy, a much simpler procedure than laparotomy, and are associated with less morbidity. [153, 154] A genetic basis for the hyperbilirubinaemia pertains to mutations in UDP-glucoronyl transferase 1 (UGT 1A), the enzyme that catalyses bilirubin glucoronidation. It seems that genetic polymorphism of the UGT 1A enzyme affects the metabolism of bilirubin. The bilirubin level as well as gallstone formation appear to be significantly higher in patients with the 7/7 genotype compared with the 6/6 genotypes of the enzyme. [155] Similar findings were reported in patients with Hb E-thalassemia. [156] Hepatic crisis (also called sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis) is manifested by the sudden onset of right upper quadrant pain, progressive hepatomegaly, increasing bilirubin levels (mostly indirect), and prolongation of prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times. [157] The levels of liver enzymes [\u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3GT) and alanine amino transferase(ALT)] are also increased but not to those levels seen in acute viral hepatitis. Hepatic crises vary in severity from mi-nor episodes to severe life-threatening situations. Total blood exchange is a recommended form of therapy. Blood exchange is indicated if the total bilirubin level increases progressively to values greater than 50 g/L. At that level, the prothrombin time values are usually prolonged. Blood exchanged should be total in nature, that is, remove whole blood and replace it with red cells and fresh frozen plasma in order to correct the coagulation abnormality.",

Firstly, hydroxyurea was approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of crises. Secondly, the long-term effects of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease are not known, and finally, some patients do not respond to hydroxyurea.

This led to the discovery that butyric acid, sodium butyrate, and GABA inhibit the normal progress of haemoglobin switching in developing animal models and stimulate the production of Hb F in adult animals.

[168] The demonstration of specific neuropathological lesions in baboons receiving extended infusions of arginine butyrate at 4-fold the human dose, however, raised safety concerns about the use of butyrate in humans. [169] The prolonged use of arginine butyrate is limited because it has to be given intravenously and because it is rapidly metabolised by the liver. This generated efforts to find oral butyrate analogues for the induction of Hb F. Isobutyramide, a butyrate derivative, has been produced as an oral alternative and has been shown to increase Hb F production. [170] Sodium phenylbutyrate, an analogue of butyric acid, is an investigational drug currently undergoing investigation in a Phase III trial for the treatment of patients with inherited disorders of the urea cycle. Non-anaemic patients receiving sodium phenylbutyrate were found to have high levels of Hb F. [171] Because butyric acid and its analogues are short chain fatty acids, other compounds that belong to this category were considered as potential inducers of Hb F. Non-anaemic patients receiving valproic acid for epilepsy had increased levels of Hb F.

Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been shown to increase Hb F levels in erythroid cell cultures, and in non-anaemic baboons and macaques. The molecular mechanism by which rHuEPO augments Hb F levels seems to be the result of recruitment of F positive progenitor cells, primarily CFU-E derived from an influx of the more primitive BFU-E compartment. [173] Clinical trials in which high doses of rHuEPO along with iron supplementation were given to patients with sickle cell anaemia showed an increase in the percentage of Freticulocytes and Hb F. [174] Extreme caution must be exercised in giving growth factors to patients with sickle cell anaemia. The administration of G-CSF to three patients with sickle cell disease caused severe pain and multiorgan failure with a fatal outcome in one. [175] [176] [177] The administration of erythropoietin to patients with sickle cell disease on a regular basis without transfusion will increase the production of sickle Hb and the Hb level to 10g% or higher that, together, are associated with increased blood viscosity which, in turn, may accelerate vaso-occlusion.",

Major mechanisms by which water is lost from sickle cells include the Ca 2+ -activated potassium channel (Gardos channel) and the KCl cotransport channel. Activation of these channels results in K + and water loss from sickle erythrocytes with consequent dehydration. A decrease in the intracellular concentration of sickle Hb, even small decreases, can slow the polymerisation of sickle Hb to a point where RBCs can exit from the capillaries (decreased transit time) before the sickle Hb polymerises (increased delay time for polymerisation). Hydroxyurea achieves this goal by decreasing the effective concentration of sickle Hb and diluting it with Hb F, which does not participate in polymerisation. Another approach to inhibit polymerisation is to rehydrate sickle RBCs and restore their normal water content. [178, 179] Recently, a selective approach to specifically rehydrate sickle RBCs by inhibiting the Gardos pathway has been tried by using oral clotrimazole. [178] In five patients treated with 20 mg/ kg/day of clotrimazole, the RBC Gardos channel was inhibited, cell K + content increased, RBCs were rehydrated, and a very modest increase in haemoglobin levels was noted. The effects of clotrimazole on cellular rehydration, however, were very modest compared with those seen in hydroxyurea. Nevertheless, the advent of clotrimazole offers a novel and different therapeutic approach for the treatment of sickle cell disease. It warrants a larger long-term clinical trial to determine its efficacy in the primary treatment of sickle cell disease. Furthermore, a combination of hydroxyurea and clotrimazole may ensue in an additive beneficial effect in ameliorating the clinical picture of sickle cell disease. Similar results were found by the use of oral magnesium, [179] which inhibits the KCl co-transport channel.",

Although management of sickle cell anaemia continues to be primarily palliative in nature, there have been promising preventative and curative approaches to therapy. Pain management should be individualised and coupled with the proper utilisation of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in order to acheive adequate pain relief. Early recognition and treatment of organ failure minimises morbidity and improves outcome. The use of hydroxyurea decreases the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell disease. Cure is possible in selected children with bone marrow or cord blood transplantation. Future research seems to focus on refining the molecular and cellular approaches to therapy including gene therapy, and mechanisms that rehydrate sickle RBC and/or prevent their adhesion to vascular endothelium.",
