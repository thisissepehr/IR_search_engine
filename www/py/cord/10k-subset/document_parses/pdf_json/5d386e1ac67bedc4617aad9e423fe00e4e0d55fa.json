Three pairs were chilled; they soaked in hot baths and then stood about undried in bathing dresses in a passage for a hat.l hour or as long as they could bear it. In addition, they wore wet socks for some hours. Most showed a drop of several degrees in body temperature, and felt rather chilly and unhappy for a time. Finally. three other pairs received the dilute vints and the chilling treatment. The results were encouraging. Chilling alone produced no colds. Dilute virus produced mild colds in two subjects, and the combined treatments, colds in four, of which two were rather good ones. We were foolish enough to repeat this experiment with a contrary result. Again, chiUing alone did nothing but those with virus alone had on this occasion twice as many colds as those having the chilling treatment in addition to vints. So we have got to find a better technique for lowering resistance or else join the school of thought that dismisses the effects of draughts and wet socks as mere superstitions. 3 Douglas and associates tried this again in the United States, and reported their results in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 1968. u In these studies, subjects were exposed in a 4\u00b0C room and were seated in a 32\u00b0C water bath.

One such study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1991, used experimental nasal inoculation in volunteers after they completed stress evaluation questionnaries. 12 The authors of this study found an increase in both infection rates and symptomatic colds with increases in psychological stress. This study controlled for age, gender, education, allergic status, season, antibodies, smoking, alcohol, exercise, and other factors. In another inoculation study conducted at Stony Brook and reported the following year, infection rates were the same, but clinical colds occurred more often in subjects with a higher number of \"life events\" in the previous year. ~3 Nasal biopsy studies have shown little, if any, cell damage or inflammatory infiltrate.. 14 Therefore recent studies have examined the role of chemical mediators in the pathogenesis of the common cold. Kinins, prostaglandins, histamine, interleukins 1, 6, and 8, as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have all been implicated as potential contributors to cold symptoms. For example, high levels of the potent vasoactive peptide bradykinin have been found in nasal secretions of subjects with symptoms but not in those shedding virus without symptoms) 5, 16 In a recent study volunteers were inoculated with a rhinovirus, and nasal lavage specimens were examined daily to measure levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1), kinins, and albumin. 17 Results showed that 24 hours after nasal inoculation there is a striking increase in each of these followed by rapid declines over the next 48 hours. IL-1 levels were not significantly increased in subjects who were infected but asymptomatic, as had previously been shown for kinins. IL-1 can increase the responsiveness of some cells to bradykinin by up-regulating the expression of kinin receptors. IL-1 increases vascular permeability, and therefore could lead to increased plasma transudation and a consequential increase in albumin in nasal secretions.",

Studies of the risk of infection by site of initial inoculation show that the amount of virus needed to produce symptomatic infection follox~_ng inoculation onto the nasal mucosa or inside the nares is 1/10,000th the amount necessary following inoculation on the nose outside of the nares. 23 Other studies have shown the conjunctiva to be a hospitable place for rhinoviruses, with transmission efficiencies approximating those of the nasal mocusa. Rhinovirus infection is not believed to occur in conjunctival cells; rather, virus deposited in the eye is rapidly passed down the tear duct into the nasal passages, The mouth is not an efficient place for transmission, as has been demonstrated by kissing studies. In 1984, the Wisconsin group reported a study in which donors kissed recipients for 11/t2 minutes (two 45-second contacts). 2~ Subjects were instructed to \"use the kissing technique most natural to them.\" Only 8% of those kissed by infected donors got symptomatic colds.",

Hang your hat on a bedpost. Drhfl\u00a2 whiskey until you see two hats. In the morning you'll be much better, For the moment, cold treatment is primarily symptomatic. There is no role for antibiotics in the typical cold. Direct approaches to the virus include blocking agents to prevent the virus from binding to ICAM-1 or to give soluble ICAM-1 to bind virus before it reaches receptors. Agents such as these are under investigation, as but none are available. Antiviral medications have been studied including interferon and other agents. Interferon does work. Studies comparing interferon alfa with placebo show that interferon-treated subjects have a diminished rate and duration of virus shedding and decreased nasal secretion weights during the period of drug administration. 36 The problem with interferon alfa is that many subjects experience local adverse effects including nasal dryness, crusting, bleeding, and mucosal ulceration, aT, 38 A number of direct antiviral agents have shown good ability to inactivate rhinovirus in vitro. One such agent, pirodavir, was studied in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. 39 Those treated with intranasal pirodavir had less virus recoverable from nasal washes, but unfortunately there was absolutely no impact of the antiviral on any of the usual cold symptoms compared with those of placebo-treated patients.",
