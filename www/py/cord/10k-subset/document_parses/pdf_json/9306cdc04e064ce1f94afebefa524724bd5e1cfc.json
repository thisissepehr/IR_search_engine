Here, we report that the Arabidopsis HY5 functions as a novel DNA-binding tag (DBtag) for proteins. We also demonstrate that the DBtagged proteins could be immobilized and purified on a newly designed agarose/DNA microplate. Furthermore, we show three applications using the microarray: (1) detection of autophosphorylation activity of DBtagged human protein kinases and inhibition of their activity by staurosporine, (2) specific cleavage of DBtagged proteins by a virus protease and caspase 3, and (3) detection of a protein-protein interaction between the DBtagged UBE2N and UBE2v1. Thus, this method may facilitate rapid functional analysis of a wide range of proteins.",

The genomic information thus obtained so far and two other technologies in particular, DNA microarray and mass spectrometry, have largely helped advancing the analyses of transcriptome and proteome. In contrast, biochemical analysis of proteins has been hampered mainly because the traditional protein analysis methods are low-throughput in nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a highthroughput analytical tool, one analogous to the DNA microarray, for proteins. In the post-genomic era, the protein microarray is particularly promising in elucidating the biochemical properties of a large number of gene products [2] . Since the proteins found in a genome will have a wide variety of biochemical properties, it would be very useful to have several methodologies for making protein arrays.",

However, this method is yet to become a commonly used biochemical tool for the analysis of proteins [4] . Certainly there are rooms for further improvement before this technology could become a routinely used laboratory tool. For example, one of the problems is the difficulty in immobilizing a variety of proteins in their functionally active forms. Many proteins needed to be appropriately oriented for proper functioning [2] . However, it is not easy to control the orientation of the protein during its mobilization on the surface of the microplate. Another problem is that the high-throughput functional analysis requires freshly produced and purified proteins; however, unlike DNA, many purified proteins are not stable and thus, cannot be stored in active condition for long time. The development of functional protein microarrays for practical use, therefore, requires relatively easy methods for the functional immobilization and purification of freshly prepared proteins on the microplate. We recently developed a highthroughput method for protein synthesis using the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis and an automatic protein synthesizer [5] [6] [7] , and demonstrated that the automatic synthesizer is very useful for the production of freshly prepared proteins.",

For example, chemically synthesized or modified DNAs have been widely used in DNA sequencing, PCR amplification and DNA microarrays. This inspired us to apply the DNA technology to comprehensive protein analysis. Several types of conserved DNA-binding domains have been found in transcription factors and nuclear hormone receptors. One of them is the bZIP domain. As described previously, the Arabidopsis HY5 transcription factor having a bZIP domain was synthesized in good quality and quantity in the wheat germ cell-free system [5] . We thus examined whether the synthesized HY5 protein could bind to a DNA-conjugated column purchased from a commercial source. Interestingly, the HY5 protein bound to the column and was eluted at a high salt concentration (500 mM) (Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, the eluted protein appeared as the major band on a SDS-PAGE because most of the endogenous proteins in the mixture were washed out with a 200 mM salt solution. This suggested the possibility of using this DNA-binding tag to purity recombinant proteins. We also found that, among 35 human nuclear hormone receptors tested, only HY5 bound to and was recovered from the DNA-conjugated column (data not shown). Since the HY5 bound to a microsatellite sequence (CA or CAA repeat) that is the highest repeat sequence in eukaryotic genome, microsatellite-binding protein may function as DNA-binding tag.",

Newly designed agarose/DNA microplate for the immobilization and purification of DBtag-fusion proteins Miniaturized and arrayed assay systems are indispensable tools for large-scale and high-throughput biochemical analyses. Among them, microarrays are especially powerful tools because they are economic, and also because of the speed by which they could be used to interpret gene functions [2] . In the process of developing a protein microarray, we designed a new microplate that carries a thin layer of agarose gel containing DNA (agarose/DNA microplate) to immobilize and purify the DBtagged proteins on the microplate (Fig. 2A) . We hypothesized that a DBtag-fusion protein would be immobilized on the agarose/DNA microplate and the other proteins would washed out. To test our hypothesis, we fused 6\u00b7 histidine, GST, streptavidin, and DBtag to the N-terminal end of GFP to produce His-GFP, GST-GFP, STA-GFP, and DBtag-GFP, respectively. Those tagged GFPs were then spotted in an array on an agaraose/DNA microplate. Consistent with our hypothesis, subsequent washing of the plate removed all the spots except those of the DBtag-GFP (Fig. 2B) . Fluorescence from the red fluorescence protein (RFP), which was used as a marker endogenous protein, was found to be diffused, and was removed by washing (Fig. 2C ). This result suggested that the endogenous proteins from the cell-free system would most likely wash out. Also the DBtag can immobilize the GFP fusion even by treatment of high-concentration detergent buffer (5% Tween-20 or 5% NP-40) (Fig. 2D) . Quantification of the DBtag-GFP spots after wash revealed that 25 \u00b1 8% (average \u00b1 S.D.) of spotted DBtag-GFP remained immobilized on the microplate. This indicates that approximately The DBtag-GFP was immobilized on the microplate, while the RFP was washed out and no RFP fluorescence was observed. (D) GFP (untagged, upper spot) and DBtag-GFP (lower spot) were spotted on the microplate. The DBtag-GFP was immobilized on the microplate by 5% of detergent treatment (5% Tween-20 and 5% NP40 panels), while the GFP was washed out and no GFP fluorescence was observed. 160 pg of DBtag-GFP was immobilized, which compares favorably to existing method [2] . The concentration of the DBtag-GFP in the spot was calculated as16 pg/nl (see Section 2.6). This result suggested that the DBtagged proteins could be immobilized and purified on the microplate.",

Out of a large number of protein kinases that are known to exhibit autophosphorylation activity [22] , we selected 11 human protein kinases, which had exhibited autophosphorylation in an earlier experiment (data not shown). The selected kinases were synthesized as DBtag-fusion proteins using the wheat germ cell-free system and were then spotted in an array on an agarose/DNA microplate. After the plate was washed, a drop of [c-32 P] ATP containing reaction mixture was applied on each spot, and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Fig. 3 shows the results of a typical autophosphorylation assay where all 11 human protein kinases on the microplate showed positive activity. The background phosphorylation activity was very low (see DBtag spots on Fig. 3) . The low-level contaminants detected in the test were attributed to be due to the endogenous wheat germ proteins.",

The activity of most of the protein kinases tested was inhibited by staurosporine at a high concentration (Fig. 3, middle and lower panels) . MST2 was especially sensitive to the staurosporine treatment and its activity drastically decreased to less than 2% of the control value by treatment with 0.1 lM staurosporine (Fig. 3, middle panel) . The activities of PAK3 and DAPK3 were inhibited by 70% and 80%, respectively, when treated with 0.1 lM staurosporine, and by 97% and 98%, respectively, when treated with 1 lM staurosporine. Eight out of the 11 human protein kinases were inhibited by staurosporine in this microarray assay. However, staurosporine did not inhibit the kinase activities of CK1g3, CK2a1, and TTK in our assay. Non-inhibition of CK1 and CK2 was reasonable because inhibition of CK1 and CK2 by staurosporine was reported as 163.5 lM and 19.5 lM of IC50, respectively [25] . To our knowledge about inhibition of TTK by staurosporine, this is the first report. Our study suggested low sensitivity of TTK to staurosporine. Also staurosporine inhibition from non-tag form proteins synthesized by the cell-free system indicated the similar data (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that our newly designed protein microarray could not only immobilize proteins in active forms but could also be used as a platform for designing assays for inhibitor screening.",

For this assay, we used fluorescence-labeled proteins as substrates, which had been immobilized on the microplate. A TEV protease recognition site was inserted between the DBtag and biotin ligation site (bls) of these test proteins. The substrate proteins were fluorescence-labeled by co-translationally biotinylating them in the cell-free protein synthesis and then adding Alexa488-STA to bind with the biotin (schematically shown in Fig. 4A ). The labeled proteins and non-biotinylated proteins (negative controls) were mixed with Alexa488-STA and then the mixture was spotted in an array on a microplate. When the plate was washed, fluorescence of the non-biotinylated proteins disappeared, which indicated that only biotinylated proteins were labeled with fluorescence (Fig. 4B, middle panel) . When incubated with the TEV protease, the proteins having the TEV protease cleavage sites lost fluorescence, while the protein having other protease cleavage sites retained fluorescence (Fig. 4B, lower panel) . We next used the approach for detection of caspase-3 (casp3) cleavage. The casp3, a key protease in apoptosis event, activates PAK2 protein kinase by cleavage [26] . Like above substrate proteins, the PAK2 was labeled with the DBtag and the biotin on bls in N and C-terminals respectively (DBtag-PAK2-bls) and spotted with Alexa488-STA on the microplate. The microplate was incubated with casp3 and washed. Like the assay of TEV protease above, fluorescence of DBtag-PAK2-bls lost (Fig. 4C, middle  panel) , while DBtag-bls (negative control) or buffer without casp3 retained fluorescence (middle and lower panels). By Western blotting, the cleavage of DBtag-PAK2-bls by casp3 was confirmed (data not shown). Thus the lost of fluorescence indicated the cleavage of the PAK2. The data showed that the DBtag-protein-bls could function as a good material for substrate screening of protease. Thus these results suggested that this microarray system could also be used for screening substrate proteins that are specifically cleaved by proteases.",

This data showed that a protein-protein interaction between UBE2N and UBE2v1 was detected on the microplate. The interaction was reduced with high salt condition (>200 mM).

High-throughput protein production is a key issue for making the protein microarray. Although the existing methods using the microarray have mainly used the cell-based method such as yeast or E. coli cells [2] [3] [4] , a large number of protein productions by the cellbased method will definitely be of substantial works. Recently, the cell-free protein production system using extracts from the wheat germ or E. coli cells has been used for high-throughput synthesis of proteins because of the simple and effective methodology (see the review [6] ). Furthermore, a fully automated robot based on the wheat cell-free system, shown in this paper, could operate a considerable number of protein productions. In addition, the biotin-labeled protein was used for detection of the protein-protein interaction and the cleavage of substrate proteins. Like the biotin labeling with the tag, the reconstruction of protein design allows wide range applications for the microarray-based functional analysis. However, using the cell-based methods, the time-consuming steps such as new vector construction are needed with every redesign of protein. In contrast the cell-free system accepts a linearly-rearranged DNA template produced by the PCR method without the new vector construction, indicating no requirement of the time-consuming steps. Thus, the cell-free system seems to be especially suitable as a protein production method for the microarray-based functional analysis.",

With today\u00d5s technology, however, it is very difficult to control the directionality, because it requires a molecular-level control on the microplate. On the other hand, columns or beads traditionally used for protein purification have been widely used for functional assays like a pull-down assay, because they could preserve a three-dimensional space for proteins to react with molecules. Here, we explored a way to purify proteins on the microplate by mildly holding the freshly synthesized proteins in a three-dimensional space. This led to a protein microarray design in which the agarose gel formed a scaffold housing the DNAs (DNA-agarose matrix), which in turn were used for immobilizing the DBtagged proteins. This design was analogous to a flexible framework known as the nuclear matrix inside the nuclei [31] . The DNA framework in the agarose gel on a microplate was expected to keep a space around the immobilized proteins in the same way as the columns and beads do. Being a polymer, agarose could also insulate the freshly prepared proteins from the air, which we believe is important for the preservation of protein activity.",

In contrast, when the microplate was washed at a low salt concentration (<50 mM NaCl), many contaminating endogenous proteins were observed (data not shown). This high salt washing was one of the keys to the production of a low-background protein microarray.

The method we describe here would allow analyzing target proteins on protein microarrays without time-consuming protein purification steps.
