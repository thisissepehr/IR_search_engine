Simpli~ed models of the host immune response in critical illness have been proposed [1] [2] [3] [4] , but not tested or validated in a manner that permits them to be of use in clinical decision-making. The value of any proposed model is to provide mechanistic insights and to identify targets for intervention that can be manipulated in a predictable manner to achieve clinical bene~t. Trauma has been a popular model of the in_ammatory response since the onset of injury is well-de~ned, and the inciting insult readily identi~able. Patrick et al. [1] have described a two hit model of an initial dysfunctional in_ammatory response following major trauma, which contributes to the development of multiple organ dysfunction ( Figure 1 ). Sequential neutrophil priming plays a pivotal role in the genesis of remote organ injury. Faist et al. [2] have proposed a model relating monocyte/macrophage and T-cell interactions to the development of an anergic state following trauma; disruption of the normal balance between TH1 and TH2 lymphocyte subsets which serves as both a marker, and a potential mechanism for developing anergy (Figure 2 ). Both models describe early and late phases of the immune response: an early phase of systemic in_ammation that can be exacerbated by a secondary insult, with resultant progression to a later and potentially lethal immunosuppressed or anergic state. An important as-sumption of these models is that the exaggerated or prolonged early pro-in_ammatory phase triggers a compensatory anti-in_ammatory response which may shift the immune balance to a suppressed phenotype [5] . This anergic state not only predisposes the host to nosocomial infection, but previously immunocompetent effector cells such as granulocytes become injurious due to super activation [6] [7] [8] , uncoordinated function [9] [10] [11] and/or delayed apoptosis [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 307, "end": 310, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 311, "end": 314, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1062, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1828, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2016, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2020, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2024, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2053, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2058, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2063, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2093, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 944, "end": 952, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1355, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Models of trauma which delineate the course of immune competence, provide useful parallels in other clinical scenarios such as ischemia-reperfusion, or systemic infection.

We present here a novel method that uses the cellular response repertoire of neutrophils, as measured by whole blood chemiluminescence, to identify bacterial products and to assess the state of neutrophil activation within the milieu of the patients immunologic pro~le. Measurement of bacterial products (endotoxin) provides a measure of a major stimulus for the septic in_ammatory response.

Neutrophil respiratory burst activity can be measured in the presence of a lumiphor (light emitting reporter molecule) by the production of NADPH oxidase dependent oxidants such as H 2 O 2 , O 2 -(using lucigenin as the lumiphor) and myeloperoxidase dependent HOCL production (using luminol as the lumiphor). Other lumiphors such as pholasin allow detection of chloramines produced secondary to HOCL release [26] . The respiratory burst activity of normal unstimulated non-in_ammatory neutrophils is minimal and its induction requires stimulation with particulate or soluble agonists such as zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Using particulate stimulants such as zymosan, the choice of ligand dependent stimulation of respiratory burst activity and degranulation in PMN's can be achieved by varying the ligands bound to zymosan. Zymosan A alone stimulates both degranulation and respiratory burst activity via interaction with the glucan binding site on CD11b/CD18 (CR3) [27] . Opsonization of Zymosan A with complement fragments such as iC3b and C3b, leads to synergistic engagement of CR1 (CD35) and CR3 receptors. When IgG molecules are bound to zymosan A, engagement of neutrophil Fc receptors with stimulation of oxidative burst and degranulation occurs. Low concentrations of the soluble diglyceride analogue PMA (10 pmol/assay) can be used to activate the NADPH oxidase complex and cause degranulation of secondary granules while high doses (5 nmol/tube) activate the NADPH oxidase and trigger degranulation of both primary and secondary granules.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 80, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 81, "end": 84, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 495, "end": 499, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1072, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measurement of neutrophil response capacity by chemiluminescence"}, {"text": "Neutrophils from patients with circulating pro-in_ammatory mediators such as TNF-a, PAF, LTB4, C5a, and IL-8 are primed for enhanced respiratory burst activity and also manifest increased oxidant production under quiescent conditions.

Such priming is associated with an increased surface expression of CR1 and CR3 receptors and conformational activation of CR3 into a higher af~nity \"avid\" state [28] . The extent of surface CR1 and CR3 receptor expression can be estimated by comparing luminescence curves in the presence and absence of a maximal stimulatory dose of C5a (20 pmol/tube). The ratio of luminescence areas (without C5a divided by maximal C5a during the acceleration phase of neutrophil activation with complement opsonized zymosan), when subtracted from 1 gives the fraction of opsonin receptor reserve which is remaining on the neutrophil surface.
