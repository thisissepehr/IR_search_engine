Fear-related behaviors played an important role in shaping the outbreak. Fear-related behaviors are defined as Bindividual or collective behaviors and actions initiated in response to fear reactions that are triggered by a perceived threat or actual exposure to a potentially traumatizing event. FRBs modify the future risk of harm.^This review examines how fear-related behaviors were implicated in (1) accelerating the spread of Ebola, (2) impeding the utilization of life-saving Ebola treatment, (3) curtailing the availability of medical services for treatable conditions, (4) increasing the risks for new-onset psychological distress and psychiatric disorders, and (5) amplifying the downstream cascades of social problems. Fear-related behaviors are identified for each of these outcomes. Particularly notable are behaviors such as treating Ebola patients in home or private clinic settings, the Blaying of hands^on Ebola-infected individuals to perform faith-based healing, observing hands-on funeral and burial customs, foregoing available life-saving treatment, and stigmatizing Ebola survivors and health professionals. Future directions include modeling the onset, operation, and perpetuation of fear-related behaviors and devising strategies to redirect behavioral responses to mass threats in a manner that reduces risks and promotes resilience.",

Epidemiologists determined that the trigger event was the zoonotic infection of a small child in rural Guinea in December 2013, setting off multiple extended chains of infection [7] [8] [9] . EVD spread rapidly to neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. These three countries with widespread and intense transmission accounted for 99.9 % of the total EVD cases; however, several dozen additional cases were reported across seven other nations on three continents [5\u2022, 10] . This international geographic footprint, with cases diagnosed in a total of ten nations, qualified the outbreak as the only Ebola Bpandemic^in history. Given the unprecedented escalation in EVD cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on August 8, 2014 [11] , a designation that would remain in force for 20 months until it was discontinued on March 29, 2016 [12] .",

First, in some instances, the ill were left behind, abandoned without care or support, thus diminishing their chances for survival [39\u2022\u2022] . Second, some persons with acute illness chose to flee due to fear of being identified and transported to an ETU. These persons were infectious and invariably placed anyone with whom they traveled or lodged at high risk. Third, quite insidiously, population movements included an admixture primarily made up of persons who were well but with an occasional infected individual who started the journey asymptomatic while incubating the virus. These migrating groups unwittingly brought Ebola infection with them. Even as they attempted to escape from disease and stigma, these groups became vectors of infection, sometimes introducing EVD into new regions based on their movements. Ladner and colleagues conducted sophisticated genomic analyses demonstrating how populations migrating from Liberia actually Breintroduced^the Ebola virus back into Guinea in multiple waves [51] .

Survivors frequently encountered stigma, rejection, and shunning at the hands of their own family members and neighbors [8, 24\u2022, 29\u2022\u2022, 77, 78] . As Rabelo et al. summarized, Bwhen EVD survivors returned home, the experience of being alive was both a gift and a burden^ [29\u2022\u2022] . Although Bthey came back from the dead,^while they were in treatment many lost family members to EVD. They had not participated in the mourning rituals, and in the case of cremation, no gravesite existed to pay respects to lost loved ones. Stigma took many forms. Some recovered EVD patients returned to their communities to find personal property destroyed and homes looted or even burned to the ground [29\u2022\u2022] . Survivors were widely believed to harbor infection and the post-Ebola somatic symptoms reinforced this misperception [29\u2022\u2022, 52, 58, 76] . Based on misguided fear of contagion, some survivors lost their jobs or were unable to sell their products in the local marketplace [24\u2022, 29\u2022\u2022] . In some instances, discrimination escalated to levels where survivors were forced to divorce, banned from public places or religious gatherings, victimized by acts of interpersonal violence, or even banished from the community [29\u2022\u2022] . Heaped upon the trauma of experiencing EVD illness and the loss of family members to the disease, Rabelo and team [29\u2022\u2022] described a harsh homecoming marked by ostracism, rejection, isolation, humiliation, and exclusion. Unable to regain their lives and livelihoods, survivors were very likely to experience symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder [29\u2022\u2022, 75\u2022\u2022, 79] . Recognition of the extreme difficulties faced by persons attempting to return to their home communities following discharge from the ETUs, CDC and other humanitarian actors developed Breintegration^and support programs to assist survivors [80, 81] .",

Consider that once the random, singular spillover event occurred (Ebola virus transmitted from a wild animal reservoir to a young human child), the propagation of the remaining 28,000 outbreak-associated cases was driven by human behaviors. The expression of FRBs potentiated the spread of disease. How did FRBs play a role? With communicable diseases, the early cases exert disproportionate effects on the downstream cascades of infection. Therefore, some of the initial behavioral choices-to treat patients in home settings, to forego Ebola care at the treatment units, to avoid clinic-based care for non-Ebola conditions, and to continue hands-on funeral practices-contributed significantly to amplifying the magnitude of the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak.",

EVD survivors tell us that the early message that EVD kills everyone that gets it was one that contributed to the spread. 2. Recognize that communities that endured unresolved trauma are more likely to respond to the cumulative effects of traumatic events. In Liberia, the dead bodies in the street from EVD were eerily similar to dead bodies from the civil war. Peacetime is the time to address past psychological trauma. 3. Attend to the social fabric of the society. Evidence from SARS and the EVD outbreak shows that communities where social cohesion and trust were high did a good job of pulling together, following basic norms about keeping safe. Those communities in Liberia that didn't believe the government tended to be the ones that denied, often at their peril, the reality of EVD. 4. Create a robust health-care system that engenders trust and attenuates fear. The global health community ought to attend to those countries with weak health-care systems since they can and will end up exporting the next infectious epidemic. 5. Devise communication and awareness-raising strategies, behavioral interventions, risk governance, and community engagement approaches that can diminish the disease impact of FRBs in the future pandemics.",
