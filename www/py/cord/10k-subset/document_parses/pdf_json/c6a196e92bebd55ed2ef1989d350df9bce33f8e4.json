            "text": "Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-mediated exon skipping is among the more promising approaches to the treatment of several neuromuscular disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main weakness of this approach arises from the low efficiency and sporadic nature of the delivery of chargeneutral PMO into muscle fibers, the mechanism of which is unknown. In this study, to test our hypothesis that muscle fibers take up PMO more efficiently during myotube formation, we induced synchronous muscle regeneration by injection of cardiotoxin into the tibialis anterior muscle of Dmd exon 52-deficient mdx52 and wild-type mice. Interestingly, by in situ hybridization, we detected PMO mainly in embryonic myosin heavy chainpositive regenerating fibers. In addition, we showed that PMO or 2 \u2032 -O-methyl phosphorothioate is taken up efficiently into C2C12 myotubes when transfected 24-72 h after the induction of differentiation but is poorly taken up into undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts suggesting efficient uptake of PMO in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. Next, we tested the therapeutic potential of PMO for laminin-a2 chain-null dy 3K /dy 3K mice: a model of merosindeficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) with active muscle regeneration. We confirmed the recovery of laminin-a2 chain and slightly prolonged life span following skipping of the mutated exon 4 in dy 3K /dy 3K mice. These findings support the idea that PMO entry into fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on dystrophinless muscle membranes and provide a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.",

At present the precise mechanism of PMO entry into dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers is still unknown (11, 12) .

Next, we injected PMO 51Do (400 mg/kg body weight) into both tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mdx52 mice aged 3 -32 weeks to induce exon 51 skipping ( Fig. 1C ) and evaluated the extent of dystrophin expression by immunohistochemistry. Two weeks after the injection, the TA muscles were isolated and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers was 45% on average when PMO was injected at 4 weeks and approximately 20% when PMO was injected from 6 to 32 weeks ( Fig. 1D and E). We found that the percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers was highest when PMO was injected into mdx52 mice at age 5 weeks when muscle regeneration was very active.",

The percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 3B and C) and dystrophin expression level by western blotting ( Fig. 3D and E) peaked in muscles where PMO had been injected at 4 days after CTX injection.

First, f-PMO (400 mg/kg body weight) targeting the splice donor site of exon 51 was injected into each TA muscle of mdx52 mice at age 5 weeks. Two weeks later, TA muscles were obtained and analyzed by RT -PCR and immunohistochemistry. We found that both PMO and f-PMO could induce similarly efficient exon 51 skipping and dystrophin expression at the fiber membrane (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5A and B). We next investigated whether the f-PMO is taken up into eMHC-positive regenerated fibers after CTX injection into muscles of 5-week-old WT mice, followed, 4 days later, by injection of f-PMO (400 mg/kg body weight) targeting the splice donor site of exon 51 into each TA muscle (Fig. 4A) . Two hours later, the mice were killed and TA muscles were removed for microscopic analysis. Clearly, 4 days after CTX injection f-PMO had entered small-caliber-regenerated fibers of less than 35 mm, but not normal-caliber fibers with peripheral nuclei (Fig. 4B ). Next, PMO 51Do (320 mg/kg) targeting the splice donor site of exon 51 was injected into the tail vein of 5-week WT mice 4 days after injection of CTX into their TA muscles (Fig. 4C ). The mice were killed 2 weeks later and TA muscles were removed and analyzed by RT-PCR. The skipping ratios as evaluated by RT -PCR were 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 15.3, 8.9 and 4.3% at Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 after the CTX injection, respectively ( Fig. 4D and E) . These data show that small-caliber-regenerated fibers can take up PMO efficiently in WT mice with a strong preference at Days 4 and 5, the period of maximum myotube formation.",

Among the AOs examined, PMO 4B plus 4D were shown to be capable of inducing exon 4 skipping at a level approaching 80%, the highest among the combinations that we examined by RT -PCR ( Fig. 7C and D) . 4B and 4D were designed to target the exonic sites of exon 4. We therefore injected the combination of two AOs (400 mg/kg body weight) into the TA muscles of dy 3K /dy 3K mice at age 10 days. Fifteen days later, TA muscles were obtained and analyzed by RT -PCR and immunohistochemistry. We found by RT -PCR that 4B plus 4D could induce exon 4 skipping (Fig. 8A) . We confirmed correct exon 4 skipping by direct sequencing of the RT -PCR products (Fig. 8B) . Moreover, up to 20% of fiber membranes were laminin-a2 positive by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 8C ). After intraperitoneal injection (150 mg/kg in total) of the 2-PMO combination into dy 3K /dy 3K mice at postnatal at age 10 days, we found that 4B plus 4D could induce exon 4 skipping by RT-PCR (Fig. 8D ). Our study results showed a trend toward improvement in life span of PMO-treated dy 3k /dy 3k mice compared with saline-treated dy 3K /dy 3K mice (Fig. 8E) . These data suggest the potential of PMO-mediated therapy targeting myotubes for MDC1A.",

PMO, which has a neutral chemistry, provides greatly decreasing the chance of catastrophic off-target antisense effects, and minimizes interactions with cationic moieties of proteins (11, (18) (19) (20) (21) . These characteristics of PMO contribute to their extremely low toxicity and suitability for use in human.

But we still face issues of off-target effects or high toxicity in humans because of the nonspecific delivery-facilitated properties and the facilitated interactions with other proteins (37) (38) (39) (40) .

This finding conforms the 'leaky membrane hypothesis'. However, PMO was most efficiently taken up into eMHC-positive regenerating fibers at 4 days following CTX injection into TA muscles, which express dystrophin at the muscle plasma membrane in WT mice. The degeneration-regeneration process induced by CTX injection was well documented as follows: after CTX injection, satellite cell proliferation occurs within 2 days, myogenic differentiation is initiated within 3 days, new myotube formation is evident within 5 days and muscle architecture is largely restored within 10 days (41) . Taken together, our in vivo study by CTX injection suggests PMO uptake is more prominent during stages from myogenic differentiation to myotube formation than cell proliferation stage. We also showed that PMO and 2 \u2032 OMePS is taken up efficiently in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. These data suggest that the uptake mechanism is not simply attributable to a change in membrane permeability but also involves an unknown mechanism in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. It is reported that PMO internalization in uptake-permissive cells is specific, saturable and energy dependent, suggesting a receptor-mediated mechanism (22) . These data suggest that immature regenerated fibers, which are called myotubes, could take up PMO more efficiently than mature fibers. In consequence, we confirmed that there is already a leaky gateway into dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers. But more importantly, these findings provide a conceptual advance in that it supports the idea that PMO entry into muscle fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on an intrinsic defect in the dystrophin-deficient muscle membrane: the 'leaky-membrane' hypothesis. As such it provides a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.",

The dy 3K /dy 3K mice, with a pMC1neo polyA+ cassette in exon 4 of the Lama2 gene, are a null mutant for the laminin-a2 chain which is a major component of basal lamina in skeletal muscle and the peripheral nervous system (16) . In man, the laminin-a2 chain consists of six domains (I-VI) and exon 4 of the LAMA2 gene encodes a part of domain VI, which are predicted to form N-terminal globular (LN) structures (Supplementary Material, Fig. S7A ) (42) . The LN structures are essential for laminin aggregation into supramolecular networks and consequently for incorporation into basement membranes, thus mutations in this structures reduce the capacity of polymer formation (43) . Another merosin-deficient mouse, the dy 2J /dy 2J mouse, harbors a mutation in the LN structures which leads only to slightly reduced expression of a laminin-a2 chain partially lacking these structures and thus displays a relatively mild muscular dystrophy and peripheral neuropathy (44) . Therefore, we hypothesized that PMO-mediated exon 4 skipping could act to rescue dy 3K /dy 3K mice. In this study, we successfully confirmed the recovery of laminin-a2 chain by skipping of the mutated exon 4. Our data suggest that PMO, which was taken up into muscle fibers, may induce exon 4 skipping in dy 3K / dy 3K mice. More importantly, PMO-mediated exon 4 skipping has a real potential to become an effective therapy for MDC1A, since two nonsense mutations in exon 4 such as 547G . ANN166X and 677C . T/210X can cause MDC1A (45) . Furthermore, half of the patients with congenital muscular dystrophy in European populations have mutations of the LAMA2 gene (42), our data could offer a hope to patients struggling with the disease.",
