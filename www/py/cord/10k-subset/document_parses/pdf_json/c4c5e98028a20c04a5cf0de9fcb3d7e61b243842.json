The therapeutic effectiveness of nucleoside analogues can be dramatically improved by phosphorylation. The ProTide approach was developed using a phosphorylated nucleoside that is masked by esterification with an amino acid and phenol forming a chiral phosphorus center. The biological activity of the ProTides depends, in part, on the stereochemistry at phosphorus, and thus, it is imperative that efficient methods be developed for the chemical synthesis and isolation of diastereomerically pure ProTides. Chiral ProTides are often synthesized by direct displacement of a labile phenol (pnitrophenol or pentafluorophenol) from a chiral phosphoramidate precursor with the appropriate nucleoside analogue. The ability to produce these chiral products is dictated by the synthesis of the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The enzyme phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta is well-known for its high stereoselectivity and broad substrate profile. Screening PTE variants from enzyme evolution libraries enabled the identification of variants of PTE that can stereoselectively hydrolyze the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The variant G60A-PTE exhibits a 165-fold preference for hydrolysis of the R P isomer, while the variant In1W-PTE has a 1400-fold preference for hydrolysis of the S P isomer. Using these mutants of PTE, the S P and R P isomers were isolated on a preparative scale with no detectable contamination of the opposite isomer. Combining the simplicity of the enzymatic resolution of the precursor with the latest synthetic strategy will facilitate the production of diastereometrically pure nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrugs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "W ith more than 20 clinically available examples, nucleoside analogues have become the standard of care for viral infections and cancer (reviewed in refs 1 and 2). These compounds typically inhibit DNA and RNA polymerases or result in accumulated mutations and chain terminations, which further disrupt genomic replication. The specificity of these compounds, such as acyclovir, for viral polymerases over host polymerases has made it the standard of care for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus. 2 While the value of nucleoside analogues is well proven clinically, their use has been limited because of poor bioavailability, the need for active transport into cells, and the requirement for cellular phosphorylation to be therapeutically active (reviewed in refs 3\u22125).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The most successful method for overcoming the challenges of nucleoside analogues has been the development of the nucleoside phosphoramidate prodrugs (ProTides, prodrug and nucleotides). 1,2 For many nucleoside analogues, the limiting step in the cellular activation of these compounds is phosphorylation, resulting in the development of drug resistance by downregulation of the relevant kinases. 3, 5 The ProTides, such as Sofosbuvir and Tenofovir Alafenamide, overcome this deficiency by starting with a phosphorylated or phosphonylated prodrug (Scheme 1). The multiple negative charges on the phosphorylated nucleoside analogues, which would normally lead to poor bioavailability and cellular uptake, are masked in the prodrugs by amide and ester bond formation. 6 This strategy of masking the phosphate moiety significantly increases the hydrophobic nature of the prodrugs, which enables cellular entry via passive diffusion across the membrane, and gives the added benefit of substantially increasing the oral bioavailability, as well as overcoming resistance due to downregulation of the transporter. 7, 8 The success of the ProTide approach has led to the Food and Drug Administration approval of Sofosbuvir and Tenofovir Alafenamide for viral infections, and several other compounds are in clinical trials to treat HIV, hepatitis C, and Ebola, as well as two compounds being tested as cancer treatments. 1,2 Regardless of the condition being treated, all ProTides are delivered to the cell as prodrugs that must undergo intracellular activation to form the active compound. In the case of the nucleotide analogues, the mechanism of activation is fairly well understood. 9\u221211 In the first activation step, the ester group of the amino acid is hydrolyzed by a peptidase or esterase. The enzymes responsible for the in vivo cleavage of this bond are known to be stereoselective, leading to widely differing activities depending on the stereochemistry of the prodrug. 9, 10, 12, 13 For example, the S P isomer of Sofosbuvir exhibits activty that is 18-fold better than that of the R P isomer against hepatitis C. 14 Tenofovir Alafenamide shows a similar dependence, with the S P isomer being 12-fold more active against HIV than the R P isomer. 15 For both Sofosbuvir and Tenofovir Alafenamide, the S P isomer is more active. However, MK-3682, developed by Merck, is the R P isomer and is activated approximately 20-fold faster than the S P isomer. 16 MK-3682 was found to be highly effective in clinical trials, demonstrating that for some ProTides the S P isomer will be more active while with others the R P isomer is more desirable. 17 The ProTide approach is not limited to nucleoside analogues. There are currently efforts to apply the ProTide technology to deliver bioactive compounds for the treatment of osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, African sleeping sickness, and tuberculosis, making apparent the need to develop robust methods for the synthesis of diastereomerically pure ProTides. 18\u221222 The most common synthetic route for ProTides involves reaction of an O-aryl, N-amino acid phosphochloridate precursor with the desired nucleoside analogue (Scheme 2). 2, 23 The simple base-catalyzed reaction can couple the nucleoside to the 5\u2032-or 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, and the desired product is formed as a diastereomeric mixture. 23, 24 Various protection schemes have been employed to prevent side product formation, but the required deprotection is generally inefficient. 2,25 Merck has reported improved stereoselective syntheses using small molecule catalysts to enhance the yield of the R P isomers. 26 However, these methods are not universal for all nucleoside analogues and still face the difficulties of side product formation and the need to separate the two diastereomers. An alternative method was recently developed to generate a chiral phosphoramidate diester intermediate with a labile aromatic group (p-nitrophenol or pentafluorophenol), which allows for a crystallographic separation of the two isomers prior to base-catalyzed substitution of the labile leaving group resulting in diastereomerically pure ProTide products. 27 This strategy was further advanced by the use of Lewis acids to catalyze the substitution reaction to control the regioselectivity without the need for protecting groups (Scheme 3). 24 Using dimethylaluminum chloride as the Lewis acid, a wide variety of ProTides can be synthesized in good yields and with minimal side products.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 398, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 399, "end": 400, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 765, "end": 766, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1110, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1681, "text": "9\u221211", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1973, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1981, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1984, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2250, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2454, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2642, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3024, "end": 3029, "text": "18\u221222", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3200, "end": 3202, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3359, "end": 3362, "text": "23,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3363, "end": 3365, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3634, "end": 3636, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4169, "end": 4171, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4354, "end": 4356, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The current state of the art in synthetic methodology enables the production of various ProTides with high purities However, the ultimate obstacle to diastereomeric purity lies in the efficient diastereomeric separation of the chiral precursor.

Previous efforts have utilized differential crystallization or chiral column chromatography to prepare these chiral precursors. While these efforts have proven to be successful, they are difficult and time-consuming. As an alternative approach, diastereometrically pure precursors can be obtained by enzymatic resolution. In this approach, the undesired isomer is preferentially hydrolyzed by a stereoselective enzyme. The PTE mutant G60A-PTE displays an \u223c165-fold preference for the R P isomer of compound 1, allowing the S P isomer to be easily isolated. The In1W-PTE variant exhibits even higher selectivity with a 1400-fold preference for the S P isomer, making the isolation of the R P isomer relatively straightforward. The hydrophobic nature of compound 1 allows for the facile recovery of the desired isomer via simple organic extraction on a preparative scale. Combining this enzymatic methodology with the regioselective synthesis methods developed by others will greatly simplify the preparation of diasteromerically pure ProTides of either stereochemistry.
