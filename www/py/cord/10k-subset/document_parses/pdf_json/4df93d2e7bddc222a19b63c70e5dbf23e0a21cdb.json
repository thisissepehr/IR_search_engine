During the outbreak 80% of diarrheal and 50070 of apparently healthy calves excreted cryptosporidial oocysts in feces. The coincidence of infection with Cryptosporidium and clinical diarrhea suggested a causal relationship. Histologic examination of intestinal sections from a necropsied deer calf showed lesions consistent with field and experimental cryptosporidiosis in other species. The deer Cryptosporidium subclinically infected newborn mice; in indirect immunofluorescence tests, it could not be distinguished from a calf Cryptosporidium.",

Infection with Cryptosporidium has been reported among several species of mammals, birds, and reptiles [3] but has not previously been observed in deer. Although Cryptosporidium is classified with other enteric coccidia, it has some distinctive characteristics. It is an extracellular parasite that infects the brush borders of enterocytes [4] , has a rapid life cycle and lacks host specificity [5] , and is pathogenic for much younger animals than the age group generally affected by other coccidia. Features of cryptosporidial infections that make recognition difficult are that the oocysts are small (diameter, 4 urn) and they are excreted in small numbers. Cryptosporidium has been associated with diarrhea in several mammalian species. Outbreaks have been most commonly observed among calves [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , but there have been reports of similar occurrences among lambs [9, 9A] , and humans [10] [11] [12] . Experimental cryptosporidiosis in newborn lambs in-Received for publication February 3, 1981 [13] with severe histopathologic lesions [13A] . In contrast, experimental exposure of laboratory animals to Cryptosporidium induces only subclinical infection [13] .",

Within two weeks, a few of the calves developed diarrhea, and over the next four weeks 56 (68070) had diarrhea that lasted two to 14 days. Twenty animals (25070) died during this period.",

The diarrhea coincided with the period in which 80070 of the deer tested were shedding oocysts. If sampling had not been confined to a single collection, the infection rate may have been higher. It should also be emphasized that the method of detection of infection is not very sensitive -there are generally few oocysts in fecal smears treated with Giemsa stain, and often a positive diagnosis is based on detection of very small numbers. The clinical disease was similar to that observed in field outbreaks of diarrhea associated with Cryptosporidium in calves [14] , lambs [9A] , and experimentally infected, specific pathogen-free lambs [13] . Intestinal lesions in an affected deer were also similar to those observed in experimentally infected lambs [13A] .",

Initially the disease was thought to be confined to artificially reared red deer, as is the case in lambs [9A] , but the involvement of a few suckled deer suggests that in the latter group colostral protection was insufficient to prevent infection. A possible explanation for this lack of protection is that the organisms were introduced recently to the deer population. In past years and under the same system of management, diarrhea in young red deer had occurred only sporadically and less severely (W. Corrigall and G. A. M. Sharman, personal communication). Furthermore, the occurrence of an outbreak of diarrhea in suckled beef calves on the same premises six months earlier may have had important epidemiologic significance. Cryptosporidia isolated from those calves and from the deer both infected laboratory animals and were serologically indistinguishable by the indirect immunofluorescence method used.",
