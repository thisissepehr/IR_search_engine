Most experimental studies have focused on lesions developed at least 24 h after infection. Although cases of severe and often fatal pneumonia in naturally infected calves seem to develop rapidly, studies focusing on the pathogenesis of the initial lung lesions caused by H. somnus are not available. Moreover, the ultrastructural lesions related to in vivo H. somnus infection have not been described. However, THOMPSON and LITTLE (1981) observed widespread contraction and desquamation of endothelial cells with adherence of H. somnus bacteria in vitm when inoculated on bovine arterial endothelial cell cultures. Also, the possible expression of adhesion mechanisms, i.e. the formation of pili in vivo, has not been examined, whereas more in vitm studies have failed to demonstrate the presence of pili (STEPHENS and LITT1-1-1, 1981; THOMPSON and LITI'LE, 1981; WARD etal., 1984) .",

In the present study, H. somnus could not be demonstrated intracellularly in epithelial cells. This could be explained by the early stage of infection, or that the apparent intracellular location observed by immunohistochemistry was an optical artefact. P. cunis biovar 2 has previously been isolated from pneumonic bovine lungs (BISGAARD et al., 1991), and might (eventually concomitantly with the isolated M. dirpurand/or Unuplasmu spp.) be the causative organism of the chronic bronchopneumonia in the cranial lobes of calf no. 2. These chronic lesions might have enhanced the ability of II. somnus to colonize in the lung. However, the degree of influence seems to be minor as the inoculum was deposited in the diaphragmatic lobe in which the acute lesions developed. The mild neutrophilic infiltration in the tonsils and the few omasal microabscesses are considered as occasional observations (BARKER et al., 1993) without any significance for this study. As the number of animals was restricted to an absolute minimum, any general conclusions should not be drawn from the present study. However, valuable information o n the early pathogenesis has been obtained which might contribute to the understanding of the disease. ",
