Evidence has indicated that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potential method for the diagnosis of patients with cardiovascular injury. However, the efficacy of MRI in diagnosing patients with myocardial infarction requires to be improved. In the present study, a novel nano-size contrast agent, a chitosan/Fe 3 O 4 -enclosed albumin (CFEA), was introduced that was used to quantify blood volume and permeability in the infarcted myocardium. A total of 68 patients with suspected myocardial infarction were recruited to analyze the efficacy of MRI combined with CFEA (MRI-CFEA). All patients received diagnosis by MRI and MRI-CFEA. It was revealed that MRI-CFEA provided a higher signal intensity than MRI in the same patients. It was demonstrated that the diagnostic efficacy of MRI-CFEA for patients with myocardial infarction was higher than that of MRI (P<0.05). By MRI-CFEA, 50/68 of cases with myocardial infarction were diagnosed, providing a significantly higher diagnostic rate compared with the 38/68 of cases diagnosed by contrast-enhanced MRI (P<0.01). MRI-CFEA successfully discriminated the infarcted regions based on a decreased fractional blood volume and increased permeability-surface (PS) area product in the infarcted myocardium. A pharmacodynamics analysis indicated that CFEA was eliminated within 24 h in all individuals. In conclusion, the present study provided a novel method to diagnose infarcted myocardium for patients with myocardial infarction, providing an imaging biomarker for the assessment of endothelial dysfunction in the clinic.",

The dose of CFEA to achieve the optimum signal intensity for MIR detection was identified as 0.30 mg/kg (Fig. 1A) . The diagnostic efficacy of MRI-CFEA in patients with suspected myocardial infarction was then further analyzed. It was demonstrated that MRI-CFEA is more specific than MRI, as more patients were diagnosed with myocardial infarction (P<0.05; Fig. 1B ). By MRI-CFEA, 50/68 myocardial infarction cases were diagnosed, which is significantly higher than the 38/68 myocardial infarction patients diagnosed by MRI (P<0.05; Table II ). It was also indicated that MRI-CFEA was able to discriminate the infarcted regions based on a decreased fractional blood volume (FBV) and increased permeability-surface (PS) area product in the infarcted myocardium ( Fig. 1C and D) . A total of 42 patients were confirmed as having myocardial infarction and 20 patients were without myocardial infarction.

In the present study, the diagnostic efficacy of the nano-size contrast agent CFEA combined with MRI was investigated to quantify the blood volume and permeability in the infarcted myocardium in a total of 68 patients with suspected myocardial infarction. It was indicated that MRI-CFEA is an efficient method for diagnosing patients with suspected myocardial infarction. Of note, a pharmacodynamics analysis demonstrated that CFEA was easily eliminated from patients with myocardial infarction within 24 h. A previous study summarized the current knowledge of the pharmacokinetic principles of gadolinium chelates for enhancing the diagnostic value of cardiac MRI in the diagnosis of complications of myocardial infarction (25) . In addition, delayed-enhancement 3.0T MRI with 0.15 mmol/kg of contrast agent superparamagnetic iron oxide provides more accuracy in the assessment of chronic myocardial infarction (26) . The present study identified that the optimal dose of CFEA was 0.30 mg/kg to achieve the maximum signal intensity for MIR detection, which enhanced the diagnostic efficacy of MRI for patients with suspected myocardial infarction. A previous study also revealed that early assessment of myocardial contractility by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is inversely associated with the contractility after revascularization in patients after AMI (27) . It was demonstrated that the nano-size contrast agent CFEA improves the signal intensity for the localization of the myocardial infarction area and the accuracy of MRI in the diagnosis of clinical patients with early-stage myocardial infarction.",
