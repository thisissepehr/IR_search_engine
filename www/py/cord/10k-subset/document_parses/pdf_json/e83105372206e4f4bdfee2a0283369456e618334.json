Although benzodiazepines have been the mainstay therapy for sedation in critically ill patients, their use has declined in recent years, with favoring of nonbenzodiazepines, such as propofol and dexmedetomidine. This change in practice is based on studies demonstrating the association between the sustained use of benzodiazepines and increased mechanical ventilation (MV) duration, ICU length of stay (LOS), and development of delirium. A paradigm shift has therefore occurred in the management of patients' sedation in the ICU. Maintenance of light levels of sedation in adult patients in the ICU has been recommended to improve patient clinical outcomes, such as shorter duration of MV and shorter ICU LOS [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 814, "end": 817, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management in critically ill patients has developed among critical care physicians [2] . The 2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption (PADIS) guideline suggested low-dose ketamine as an adjunct to opioid therapy for reducing opioid consumption in post-surgical adults admitted to the ICU (i.e., conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence) [1] . In a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 93 ICU post-abdominal surgery patients, adjunctive ketamine was associated with a reduced intake of morphine. However, there were no differences in patients' self-reported pain intensity [3] . Ketamine was administered as 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) push followed by infusion of 2 \u03bcg/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) \u00d7 24 h, then 1 \u03bcg/kg/ min \u00d7 24 h (0.06 mg/kg/h). The incidence of side effects (i.e., nausea, delirium, hallucination, hypoventilation, pruritus, and sedation) did not differ between the ketamine and opioidalone groups. Based on this generally positive ICU RCT, the 2018 PADIS panel made a conditional recommendation for the use of low-dose ketamine as an adjunct to opioids to optimize acute post-operative pain management in critically ill adults (refer to Supplementary Table 1 : Previous ketamine trials in the ICU setting) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 139, "end": 142, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 442, "end": 445, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 706, "end": 709, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1355, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1359, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1363, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1367, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1371, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1375, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1379, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1383, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1388, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1393, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1297, "end": 1304, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Because of an increased focus on ensuring that pain is appropriately controlled in patients before using sedative-hypnotic medications (also known as the analgo-sedation approach), ketamine has gained attention for its unique pharmacologic properties that could address both the analgesic and sedative requirements. Ketamine could result in decreased duration of MV while providing optimal levels of sedation [12] . Similar to dexmedetomidine, ketamine has a non-GABAergic mechanism of action [13] . It induces rapid sedation and analgesia through dual mechanisms mediated by inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and activation of the opioid \u03bcand \u03ba-receptors [14] . Ketamine is also Saudi Food and Drug Authority (FDA)-approved for the induction of anesthesia and has been used for acute and chronic pain in sub-anesthetic dose, post-operative opioid sparing, rapid sequence intubation, and procedural sedation and analgesia [15] . Additionally, ketamine has favorable characteristics, including bronchodilation, preservation of cardiac output, increase in blood pressure, minimal effects on bowel motility, and maintaining of respiratory drive and airway reflexes while actively weaning from MV; these features make it an especially viable alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 409, "end": 413, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 493, "end": 497, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 670, "end": 674, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1326, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Although commonly used sedatives are effective, they have side effects including benzodiazepine-associated delirium, opioid-induced constipation, and the negative hemodynamic effect caused by propofol and dexmedetomidine [1, [16] [17] [18] . The most frequently observed adverse effects associated with ketamine when used to maintain sedation include tachycardia (6.7%), hypertension (6%), paradoxical agitation (up to 20%), and hypersalivation (12%) [12] . Although there is limited literature on adults, as many as 57% of pediatric patients who receive ketamine for continuous sedation experience the emergence phenomenon, including vivid hallucinations and delirium during or after ketamine use [19] . When ketamine is used for procedural sedation in adults (usually administered as a relatively high dose, 1-2 mg/kg repeated q5-15 min to maximum 100 mg), up to 20% of patients may develop the emergence phenomenon [20] . Risk factors for delirium with ketamine include prior history of psychiatric disorders, dementia, and the use of a high dose in procedural sedation [20] . The development of the emergence phenomenon can cause patients to transiently require higher amounts of other sedatives, usually benzodiazepines. However, ketamine-based analgo-sedation in MV patients administered as a subanesthetic/sub-dissociative/low dose results in similar numbers of delirium-and coma-free days as those in non-ketamine-based regimens, as shown in a retrospective cohort study conducted by Shurtleff et al. at an academic medical center [8] . Ketamine infusion in this trial was 5 \u03bc g/ kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h) titrated using 5 \u03bc g/kg/min every 5 min up to a maximum of 25 \u03bc g/kg/min (1.5 mg/kg/h). The authors found that the number of days alive without delirium or coma was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2-9 days) with ketamine and 4 days (IQR 3-7 days) with a non-ketamine medication (P = 0.351). Delirium occurred in 29 of the 39 patients (74%) with ketamine and in 34 of the 40 patients (85%) with the non-ketamine drug (P = 0.274).

The protocol promotes analgesia-first sedation (with fentanyl) and recommends propofol as the first-line agent when sedation is required. Patients receive a daily spontaneous awakening trial (SAT) paired with a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The RASS and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) are routinely used to assess the level of sedation and the presence of delirium, respectively. Ketamine, registered by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, is a KFSH&RC hospital formulary medication and is listed in the KFSH&RC ICU pain and sedation protocol as an option for patients with severe bronchospasm.

Most trials listed in Supplementary Table 1 are in surgical ICU settings, retrospective in nature, or are RCTs focused on comparing ketamine to placebo or two study drugs (e.g., ketamine vs opioid). However, most patients in the ICU are sedated with a combination of drugs. Moreover, most trials had a limited focus on patientcentered outcomes, such as duration of MV or ICU LOS, as the primary outcome favoring surrogate outcomes, such as sedation scores and changes in analgesics and sedatives [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . To help further delineate ketamine's role as a maintenance analgo-sedation agent in the ICU, further RCTs need to be conducted to compare the effects of ketamine to those of other analgesics and sedatives on reducing the duration of MV, ICU LOS, and delirium occurrence. Recently, there was a prospective, double-blinded, multicenter RCT (KeMiMof) in critically ill patients > 12 years old and requiring sedation for > 24 h in the ICU, in Uganda. Patients were randomized to receive either ketamine-midazolam or morphinemidazolam given as premixed 50-ml syringes for infusion. The primary outcome measures were duration of MV, incidence of hypotension, and incidence of delirium. The trial was terminated on 28 August 2019 with pending results.

The included studies describe dosing regimens up to 103.3 \u03bc g/kg/min (6.2 mg/kg/h), which is substantially higher than the doses prescribed in our cohort. As most patients in the review had a neurological injury, sedatives were administered to maintain deep sedation, and often with background benzodiazepine infusion or even barbiturate anesthesia [12] . On the other hand, Groetzinger and colleagues used continuous infusion ketamine for adjunct sedation in a population of mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults targeting light sedation; ketamine was infused at a median starting dose of 1.6-4.2 \u03bc g/kg/min (0.1-0.25 mg/kg/h) for a median of 2.8 days. The maximum doses of ketamine in individual patients experiencing adverse drug reactions (such as tachyarrhythmia) ranged from 2.08-20 \u03bc g/kg/min (0.125 to 1.2 mg/kg/h), necessitating discontinuation of the infusion [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 712, "end": 716, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1246, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We aimed to describe our experience using ketamine as an adjunct low-dose sedative in an era that emphasizes light sedation in a complex, mechanically ventilated, critically ill population, specifically patients with medical illnesses, or following complicated surgical procedures.

Another limitation is exclusion of patients in status asthmaticus or status epilepticus and patients placed on ECMO, as the dosing regimen of ketamine in those conditions is different than the regimen we used herein as an adjunct analgo-sedative agent.

Future trials addressing cardiac assessment and hemodynamic metrics in a more protocolized way would be a great addition. For example, studies could assess metrics such as measurement of cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), and stroke volume variation (SVV) estimated by arterial pulse pressure waveform analysis (e.g., with the Vigileo monitor) at baseline (prerandomization) and at 24 and 48 h afterward (post-randomization), considering other potential confounders and adjunct interventions to evaluate whether these findings are direct consequences of ketamine or independent changes related to the severity of critical illness and the cumulative effect of adjunct interventions (i.e., antimicrobials, steroids, fluid administration, and blood products).
