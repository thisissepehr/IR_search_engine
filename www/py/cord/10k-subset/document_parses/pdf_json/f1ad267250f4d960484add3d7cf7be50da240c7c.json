Interestingly, we observed a tendency of a decrease in peripheral blood cell values even in patients without cytopenias, with a median time to nadir similar to those patients with cytopenias. We did not randomly choose the HLH-04 criteria for defining the hematological abnormalities in the present study.

Although rarely, hemophagocytic syndrome has been described in patients with severe influenza virus infection, usually associated with a poor outcome and a high mortality rate [3, 27] . In Beutel's study of 25 critically ill patients with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus associated hemophagocytic syndrome, the absence of steroid therapy in the early phase of the infection might have contributed to the high incidence of HPS (9 out of 25 patients) and the rather poor outcomes [18] .

In our univariate analysis, both thrombocytopenia and anemia were significantly associated with poor outcome. To our knowledge, anemia as a poor prognostic marker in patients with influenza virus infection had not been previously described. Indeed, the two most notable aspects of our model are the presence of any hematological abnormality as a marker of poor outcome and the potential beneficial role of steroids in these patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 488, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 489, "end": 491, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An interesting finding in our study was the better outcome observed in patients who were already using steroids before admission, while the use of steroids during admission was associated with poor outcome. This paradox could be explained by two facts. First, as in other series [4, 18] , steroids were mostly prescribed for COPD exacerbations, asthma exacerbations or bronchospasms, but not as immunomodulatory therapy; therefore, time to treatment initiation, duration of treatment, and prescribed doses, were not always optimal. In fact, only one patient in our series received high.dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg/m 2 ) and that was for the treatment of hemophagocytic syndrome triggered by influenza virus infection with marked hemophagocytosis in bone marrow. Second, it is known that onset of influenza A viruses infections is very acute by triggering a cascade of immune responses and switching on almost all parts of the immune defense system [29, 30] . In fact, in the present study, hematological abnormalities presented early in the course of the infection in a large number of patients. We believe that steroid therapy before admission could have modulated the acute inflammatory response triggered by influenza virus infection in the early course of the disease, and with this, prevented an uncontrolled immune response [28] . This finding, if confirmed in properly prospective designed studies, may establish the utility of early use of steroids in some subgroup of patients with influenza virus who required hospitalization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 283, "end": 286, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 955, "end": 959, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 960, "end": 963, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1341, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "By using more restrictive criteria for the definition of cytopenias as compared to other series, our study might have underestimated the percentage of patients who presented with hematological abnormalities. Additionally, the observational retrospective nature of the study complicates the accurate assessment of the role of steroid therapy during admission, especially since it was mostly prescribed for other indications rather than the infection itself. This wide range of indications, although similar to other series, precludes a correct assessment of steroid therapy as a poor prognostic factor.

If severe cytopenias were observed, we consider that a systematic determination of ferritin, triglycerides and fibrinogen levels would be beneficial.
