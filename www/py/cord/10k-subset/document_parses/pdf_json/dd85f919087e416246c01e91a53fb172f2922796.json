The key process in this is the recognition of microbial agents by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), RNA helicases (RIG-I (retinoid acid-inducible gene-I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), and LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology gene 2)), C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic DNA sensors (DNA-dependent activator of IFNregulatory factors, absent in melanoma-2, interferon inducible protein 16 (leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1), RNA polymerase III, DExD/H box RNA helicases, and IFI16), which sense evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of microorganisms. 1 By detecting PAMPs, PRRs trigger sequential activation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to induction of a range of cytokines and chemokines that orchestrate the early host resistance to infection. Specifically, activation of NLRs results in the formation of a molecular scaffold complex (an inflammasome) that leads to the active release of interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-18 through caspase-1 activation ( Figure 1 ). These PRRs signaling also facilitate the differentiation of T cells and B cells to establish antigen-specific adaptive immunity. [2] [3] [4] Since the discovery of TLRs as a major family of PRRs, it has been of great interest whether or not they are functionally expressed in intestinal epithelial interface and what roles they have in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the unique nature of the gut where diverse microorganisms coexist, microbialsensing TLRs may have special roles in mucosal homeostasis. Among the 13 TLRs discovered, TLR1 through TLR9 have been identified as being expressed in human IECs. 5, 6 However, the functional consequences of these TLRs in healthy gut physiology have yet to be fully determined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1500, "end": 1503, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1507, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1511, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1987, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1359, "end": 1367, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although it has not been fully understood how the TLR responses in IECs are regulated in the face of commensal 1 bacteria in the human intestine, in vitro data has demonstrated hyporesponsiveness of IECs to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. 5, 6 The underlying mechanism of this observation comprises a decrease in TLR surface expression and the induction of an inhibitory molecule of TLR signaling after ligand stimulation. Antigenpresenting cells in the lamina propria also appear to be unresponsive to TLR ligands. 7 Other TLRs are normally expressed in endosomes (TLR3, TLR7 to TLR9) or basolateral membrane (TLR5), where these TLRs are not exposed to pathogens unless pathogens get into the cells or invade mucosa. NOD and NLRs are also expressed in the cytoplasm and thus do not recognize extracellular pathogens unless pathogens inject the cells' effector proteins ( Table 1) . On the other hand, constitutive activation of selected TLR signaling in IECs may be required for epithelial homeostasis. IEC-specific deletion of the downstream molecules of TLR signaling such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1, and nuclear factor-kB essential modulator in mice results in spontaneous intestinal inflammation. [8] [9] [10] TLR9 can be expressed on the apical or the basolateral sides of IECs, in which ligand recognition activates a tolerogenic or inflammatory responses, respectively. 11 In addition to IECs, many TLRs are expressed and have unique roles in Paneth cells, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells in the intestine.

Upon recognition of pathogens, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (mainly TLR4) induces transcription of IL-18 and IL-1b. Expression of mRNA for these genes produces pro-forms of IL-18 and IL-1b protein within the cytosol. At the same time, TLR signaling induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and following release of mitochondrial DNA, which activates nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). NLRs are also activated by detecting various ligands introduced via phagocytosis followed by lysosomal stabilization, bacterial type III secretion system, or intracellular metabolic and/or enzymatic activities. The activated NLRs are homo-or hetero-oligomalized to form multi-protein complex termed ''inflammasome'' that activate caspase-1.

Nevertheless, the lack of spontaneous phenotypes in most PRR-deficient mice suggests the possible involvement of compensatory mechanisms. As many pathogens carry multiple PAMPs, a pathogen can be redundantly recognized by multiple PRRs within a single cell of the host. Because PRRs share several key innate immune signaling pathways, intestinal immune homeostasis may be preserved by providing a sufficient host response to commensal microorganisms in most PRR-deficient mice ( Figure 2 ).

The spontaneous intestinal inflammation in TLR5 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice implies a distinct role of TLR5 in maintenance of mucosal immune response to commensal bacteria. Induction of colitis in TLR5 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice is inhibited by cross breeding these mice with TLR4 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice, indicating that the mucosal inflammation is TLR4-dependent without TLR5 regulation. 25 It is still unclear which cell types in intestinal mucosa are responsible for the TLR4-mediated induction of colitis. However, epithelial TLR4 signaling is unlikely to be involved, because constitutively active expression of epithelial TLR4 does not induce mucosal inflammation in the villin-TLR4 transgenic mice. 21, 28 Though, selective deletion of MyD88 in IECs results in spontaneous inflammation of the small intestine, 8 MyD88 signaling in myeloid cells is required for the development of intestinal inflammation during colonization of RAG2 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice with Helicobacter hepaticus. 29 Consistently, TLR4 signaling in myeloid cells has been implicated with mucosal inflammation during enteric Citrobacter rodentium infection. 30 Therefore, TLR signaling in the myeloid cell compartment has more significant roles than epithelial TLR signaling in induction of mucosal inflammation in the intestine. Dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been implicated as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 31 Given the importance of mucosal PRR signaling in the maintenance of commensal flora in the normal intestine, PRR deficiency may alter the composition of commensal flora that may be involved in the pathogenesis of colitis. The colitic TLR5 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice show increased intestinal bacterial burden and variability of commensal flora compared with non-colitic TLR5 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice. 25 An increase of the Enterobacteriaceae composition has been shown during chemically induced colitis in mice, which correlates with the severity of intestinal inflammation. 32 The extent of this shift in commensal composition during colitis is less in TLR2/TLR4 double-deficinet mice than WT mice. 32 In addition, the TLR2/ TLR4 double-deficient mice have significantly less burdens of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Enterococcous species in the intestine compared with WT mice. 32 However, the alteration of composition of commensal flora in TLR-deficient mice is limited at baseline and mostly dependent on maternal transmission rather than TLR regulation of host-commensal interactions. 33 IL-10 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mouse is a well-established model of colitis as they develop spontaneous colitis due to uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to commensal flora. 34 In fact, different types of commensal bacteria cause intestinal inflammation with different onset, location, and degree in IL-10 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice. 35 Interestingly, nullifying MyD88 in IL-10 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice results in the prevention of colitis induction. 36 There are conflicting reports regarding inhibition or acceleration of colitis in TLR4/IL-10 double-knockout mice, which may be explained by differences in flora across various facilities. [37] [38] [39] Cross breeding IL-10 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice with TLR2 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice have shown exacerbation of colitis, but crossing IL-10 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice with TLR9 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice did not alter intestinal phenotype of IL-10 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice despite both TLR2 and TLR9 signal through MyD88. 37, 40 Nullifying MyD88 in other commensal-dependent spontaneous colitis models, such as IL-2 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice or Tbx21 \u00c0 / \u00c0 Rag \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice both show similar severity of colitis as their MyD88-sufficient counterparts. 36, 41, 42 Interestingly, treatment of TLR4/TLR5 double-knockout mice with IL-10 receptor neutralizing antibody (IL-10R mAb) results in development of colitis but IL-1R-deficient TLR5 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice does not show signs of colitis in response to IL-10R mAb treatment. 43 Because IL-1R shares MyD88 signaling with other TLRs, these results indicate that IL-1 and MyD88 signaling may have a role for induction of colitis seen in TLR5 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice, although in another study IL-1R \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice displayed worse colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). 44 These conflicting results suggest that the role of MyD88 in comensal dependent colitis may differ depending on its upstream inputs and cytokine profile.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 836, "end": 839, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3240, "end": 3244, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3245, "end": 3249, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3250, "end": 3254, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3499, "end": 3502, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3712, "end": 3715, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3716, "end": 3719, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The role of TLRs in intestinal inflammation"}, {"text": "Demand for PRR signaling becomes higher in the setting of epithelial damage than homeostatic conditions in the gut. Regardless of the cause, disruption of the epithelial barrier integrity leads to exposure of mucosal immune system to the mass of commensals. During epithelial damage, PRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns that are released from host tissues. 45, 46 Mouse DSS-induced colitis is a well-established colitis model specifically relevant to investigate intestinal innate immune responses to epithelial injury as this model is induced by chemical damage of the epithelium and does not require adaptive immunity. 47 In the DSS-induced colitis, it has been shown that germ-free mice demonstrate worse colitis compared with conventional mice, but similar severity of colitis has been noted between conventional mice and the commensal-depleted mice that are orally supplemented with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. 48, 49 Consistently, TLR2 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and TLR4 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice show increased severity of DSS-induced colitis. 49, 50 MyD88, but not TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF)-deficient, mice also demonstrated more severe disease than WT mice in this model, suggesting the importance of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling in protection against mucosal damage. 50,51 However, the underlying mechanisms of protection differ between TLR2 and TLR4. TLR2 signaling in IECs induces tight junctional protein ZO-1 through activation of protein kinase C, which strengthen epithelial barrier integrity and resists cell apoptosis. 52 ,53 TLR2 signaling also induces cytoprotective trefoil factor production. 54 By contrast, TLR4-mediated MyD88 signaling in IECs and subepithelial macrophages induces cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) that amplifies mucosal prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) synthesis, supporting epithelial survival. [55] [56] [57] [58] TLR4 signaling in IECs also induces expression and release of amphyregulin and epiregulin that activate epidermal growth factor receptor. 59 Therefore, multiple cytoprotective functions in IECs are covered by several TLRs signaling, but defects in different aspects of the cytoprotection may result in similar manifestations in the intestine. The DSS colitis model may rely on different mechanisms to induce acute vs. chronic inflammation. For example, TLR9 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice have shown to be more susceptible to acute DSS colitis, but they demonstrate less severe manifestations of colitis during repeated cycles of DSS treatments compared with WT mice. 11,60 Suppression of TLR9 signaling by adenoviral oligodeoxynucleotides, which is known to block the effect of bacterial cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides, have demonstrated a suppressive effect of intestinal inflammation in various mouse models of chronic colitis. 60 Therefore, bacterial DNA from commensal flora is one of the factors inducing intestinal inflammation through activation of TLR9 during chronic colitis.

[63] [64] [65] Furthermore, NLRP6 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice have significantly elevated expression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) chemokine in the colon compared with WT mice, suggesting that NLRP6 has an important role for the negative regulation of CCL5 to maintain intestinal host-commensal homeostasis. 27 Interestingly, the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and upregulation of CCL5 in NLRP6 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice is associated with alterations of commensal composition (especially high prevalence of genus Prevotellaceae and group TM7 bacteria). 27 Co-housing with NLRP6 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice and hence adopting similar flora, WT mice experienced upregulation of CCL5 in the colon.

Although precise mechanisms underlying initiation and/or promotion of the inflammation-associated intestinal cancer have yet to be fully determined, frequent cycles of injury and repair of the epithelium in the presence of tumorigenic cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins may predispose to genetic mutations, which increases neoplastic risk. 96, 97 As conventionalization of germ-free animals accelerates epithelial proliferation in the intestine, PRR signaling may have an important role in regulation of epithelial proliferation. 98 It has been reported that TLR-mediated MyD88 signaling in subepithelial macrophages regulates crypt stem cell differentiation and epithelial proliferation through expression of COX-2 and PGE 2 . 57,58 TLR4 stimulation has also been shown to induce proliferation of human IECs via induction of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands. 99, 100 The inflammatory milieu may enhance surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4, leading to IECs responsiveness to their ligands. 101, 102 These results suggest that abnormal TLR signaling, especially TLR2 and TLR4 in both IECs and subepithelial macrophages, may induce aberrant epithelial proliferation and thus may contribute to cancer development in the setting of chronic inflammation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 500, "end": 503, "text": "93,", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1305, "text": "96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1833, "text": "99,", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1964, "text": "101,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TLRs AND NLRs IN INFLAMMATION-ASSOCIATED COLORECTAL CANCER"}, {"text": "Recent reports regarding PRR phenotypes in mouse models of colitis-associated (AOM-DSS) and spontaneous multiple intestinal (Apc/Min) neoplasia appear to show some important pathways in the regulation of intestinal tumorigenesis ( Table 3 ).

Extensive studies in animal models of colitis have provided several key points of the contribution of individual PRRs and their effector pathways in the pathogenesis of colitis. Epithelial PRR signaling mainly promotes mucosal protection through induction of pathways that leads to cell proliferation and survival or cytoprotection in response to mucosal injury. By contrast, it is likely that PRR signaling in hematopoietic cells is responsible for induction of local inflammation in response to invading pathogens. These PRR signals may be enhanced during chronic inflammation in the intestine. Continuous activation of abnormal PRR signaling leads to the development of neoplasms. In this regard, PRR signaling is involved in multiple aspects of intestinal tumorigenesis as well as host antitumor immunity. Manipulation of PRR signaling as therapeutic strategies of human diseases has just begun.
