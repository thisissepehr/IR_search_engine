Our studies suggest that a receptor-targeted approach to preventing coronavirus infection is worthy of further study.

Couch RB. Rhinoviruses The frequencies of antibody development so far reported in patients treated with different interferons (IFNs) are not readily comparable because of differences in treatment regimens and assay methods. Thus the frequency of neutralizing antibody development was analyzed in a large sample of sera derived from a relatively homogeneous group of patients treated with different IFN-a preparations. The frequency of developing neutralizing antibody to IFN varied according to the IFN given. Particularly, the seroconversion frequency was significantly higher in patients treated with recombinant IFN-a2a (20.2%) than in patients treated with either recombinant IFN-a2b (69%) or IFN-aNl (1.2%), a lymphoblastoid IFN-a.

This agrees with reports of the successful use of natural IFN mixtures in patients who relapsed after forming neutralizing antibodies while under treatment with an rIFN-a2 preparation [11, 12] .At this time it is difficult to explain the different immunogenicity of the types ofIFNs used in this study. Several hypotheses have been considered. (1) It is possible that natural IFN, which is a mixture of at least 18 homologous subtypes, may be less immunogenic than rIFN since any subtype is actually present at a lower concentration than in an equal dose of rIFN, which contains only a single molecular species. (2) Since the rIFNs we used have different amino acid sequences, it is tempting to speculate that the tertiary structure and thus immunogenicity of the molecule is influenced by the specific amino acid substitutions that have been introduced into IFN-a2a and", "cite_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 481, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 482, "end": 485, "text": "12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
