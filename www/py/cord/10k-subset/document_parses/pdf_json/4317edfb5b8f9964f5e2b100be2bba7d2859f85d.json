Three cystinuria types can be distinguished by the mode of inheritance (true recessive or intermediate) and by the pattern of the intestinal amino acid transport. In the present study phenotypes were assessed by the urinary excretion of amino acids related to creatinine, the percentage tubular amino acid reabsorption and the urinary excretion of polyamines as a possible indicator of the intestinal transport defect. However, our thorough phenotyping did not reveal more than two cystinuria types. Genotypes were examined in linkage analyses and single-strand conformation polymorphism-based mutation identification. The SLC3A1 mutations M467T and T216M were disease causing in our homozygous patients of type I cystinuria. We can show the association of type I cystinuria with SLC3A1 and of non-type I cystinuria with a yet unidentified gene on chromosome 19q13.1. Our phenotype and genotype analyses provide evidence for only two types of cystinuria in the investigated patient cohort.",

Cystinuria may be transmitted either as a true recessive (type I) or as an intermediate trait (non-type I = type II and III) [1] . In the latter state heterozygotes excrete the affected urinary amino acids in larger quantities than normal but less than in the homozygous state. Double heterozygotes with alleles of both the true recessive and the intermediate type excrete cystine and dibasic amino acids in amounts as high as homozygotes [2] . Rosenberg et al. [1, 3] observed differences in the intestinal amino acid resorption, which led to the differentiation between type II and III. Up to now two cystinuria loci have been published: SLC3A1 (2p16.3) [4, 5] and a locus on chromosome 19q with a Zmax of 13.11 for D19S225 [6, 7] .",

The aim of our study was to describe the different cystinuria phenotypes and their genetic correlates as precisely as possible by the use of minimally invasive methods. We investigated 17 cystinuria-families with altogether 117 probands. The renal transport defect was assessed by urinary amino acid excretion and percentage tubular amino acid reabsorption (%T aa ). To estimate the intestinal transport defect, the urinary excretion of the polyamines cadaverine, putrescine, spermidine and spermine was determined as a pos-sible marker. We analyzed the corresponding genotypes by haplotyping the marker loci D2S119 and D2S177 linked with SLC3A1 in 80 probands (10 families). In those families in which an association of the SLC3A1 markers with the cystinuria phenotype was not excluded (the two families with type I cystinuria and both double heterozygous families), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)-based mutation analysis of this gene was performed. A search for the possible locus of nontype I cystinuria was then initiated in the remaining six families (54 persons).",

Amino acids were determined by ion exchange chromatography on a Biotronic amino acid analyzer LC 5000 [2] . Polyamine analysis was performed on a modified Biotronic amino acid analyzer LC 2000, using a K + -gradient instead of a Li + -gradient and fluorescence detection with o-phthaldialdehyde instead of photometry with ninhydrin. Using this method polyamines could be detected in urine samples at concentrations as low as 0.01 \u00b5mol/l. Creatinine was determined by a kinetic Jaff\u00e9 reaction. Urinary amino acids and polyamines were corrected per gram of creatinine. The determination of %T aa , originally performed with inulin as marker of glomerular filtration rate [9] , was modified to creatinine and based on spot urine samples [10] . This method required simultaneously collected blood and urine samples. The time gap between venipuncture and void never exceeded 30 min. The %T aa was calculated by the following equation:",

Our data of 48 non-type I heterozygotes show large variations over a wide range. In repeated measurements, urinary excretion rates varied from day to day to such an extent that, according to Goodyer's classification, the same proband would have been assigned to type II on one day and to type III on another.

In two other families recombinations were observed: in family IX D19S414 and in family VII D19S416 were shown to mark the centromeric border of the possible gene location (Fig. 5) . Comparing our results with those of previous studies [6, 7] , the most probable gene location of non-type I cystinuria lies between D19S416 and D19S425, a region spanning about 1.5 cM. The isolation of one or more cystinuria genes in the 19q13.1 region and genotyping, as well as a careful phenotyping of cystinuric patients (including their intestinal amino acid resorption) will help to finally resolve the question about the number of different cystinuria types.",

The amount of polyamines formed by bacterial decarboxylation of dibasic amino acids in the gut depends on the amount of protein uptake. However, polyamines do not solely originate from bacterial decarboxylation of dibasic amino acids, they are also formed in the human body and can be found in all tissues [37] . Embryonic, neoplastic and other rapidly growing tissues contain polyamines in particularly high concentrations [37] . Elevated amounts were observed in the urine of patients with malignancies [38] , liver cirrhosis [39] or ARDS [40] . Some authors interpret the urinary hyperexcretion of polyamines as a marker of catabolic metabolism in general [41, 42] .",

With this highly sensitive method, putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and spermine were found in the urine of most of our probands, including the healthy controls. The urinary excretion of putrescine and cadaverine was moderately higher in homozygotes and double heterozygotes than in non-type I heterozygotes and controls, but in multivariant analysis the mean value differences between these groups turned out to be not significant. Spermidine and spermine were excreted in similar amounts by cystinurics and controls. Thus, the urinary excretion of putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and spermine turned out to be of little value for the assessment of the intestinal amino acid transport defect associated with cystinuria. To verify the phenotype definition of Rosenberg et al. [1] , the resorption defect would have to be investigated by more subtle and specific means. Suitable methods for this purpose may require invasive diagnostic techniques, like endoscopy for double lumen perfusion or jejunal mucosa biopsies.",

The genetic analysis of our patients confirmed this differentiation. Considering the great variability in cystinuria phenotype expression, we found no basis for the differentiation of more than two genetically distinct cystinuria types. We identified maternal demographic, behavioral, and medical history factors that predict bacteriuria (that is, symptomatic and asymptomatic urinary tract infection) at prenatal care initiation. We applied logistic regression modeling to data from all prenatal care recipients who delivered during 1990-1993 and resided in selected North Carolina counties (n = 8037), omitting those with di-abetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus, or structural urologic abnormalities. The two strongest predictors of bacteriuria at prenatal care initiation were an antepartum urinary tract infection prior to prenatal care initiation [for whites, adjusted prevalence odds ratio (POR) = 2.5, 95% CI 0.6-9.8; for blacks, POR = 8.8, 95% CI 3.8-20.3] and a pre-pregnancy history of urinary tract infection (POR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2). For white women only, education beyond high school and age greater than or equal to 30 years were inversely associated (POR less than or equal to 0.6). Sickle cell hemoglobin nearly doubled the prevalence odds for bacteriuria among African-Americans (POR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.5), whereas African-Americans with normal hemoglobin had reduced prevalence odds compared with whites (POR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9). This study suggests predictors not considered before, including race controlling for sickle cell disease or trait and antepartum urinary tract infections prior to prenatal care.",
