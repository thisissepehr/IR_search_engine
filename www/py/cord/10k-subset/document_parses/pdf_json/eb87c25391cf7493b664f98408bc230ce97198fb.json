However, in human monocytic ehrlichiosis, respiratory signs are common and signs of interstitial pneumonia are well known. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is classified based on the underlying disease and its treatment is aimed at reducing the clinical signs and, if possible, addressing the primary disease process. PH is often irreversible, but can be reversible if it is secondary to a treatable underlying etiology. CME is currently not generally recognized as one of the possible diseases leading to interstitial pneumonia and secondary PH in dogs. Only one case of PH associated with CME has been reported worldwide.",

The dog previously lived in the Cape Verdean islands. Physical examination showed signs of right-sided congestive heart failure and poor peripheral perfusion. Thoracic radiography showed moderate right-sided cardiomegaly with dilation of the main pulmonary artery and a mild diffuse interstitial lung pattern with peribronchial cuffing. Echocardiography showed severe pulmonary hypertension with an estimated pressure gradient of 136 mm Hg. On arterial blood gas analysis, severe hypoxemia was found and complete blood count revealed moderate regenerative anemia and severe thrombocytopenia. A severe gamma hyperglobulinemia was also documented. Serology for Ehrlichia canis was highly positive. Treatment with oxygen supplementation, a typed packed red blood cell transfusion and medical therapy with doxycycline, pimobendan and sildenafil was initiated and the dog improved clinically. Approximately 2 weeks later, there was complete resolution of all clinical signs and marked improvement of the PH.",

In patients with interstitial pneumonia, gas exchange is often impaired due to ventilation-perfusion mismatching, intrapulmonary shunting, and decreased diffusion across the abnormal interstitium with arterial hypoxia as a consequence. In contrast to the systemic vasculature that responds with arterial vasodilation to better perfuse hypoxic tissue, the pulmonary vasculature constricts in response to hypoxia. Besides pulmonary vasoconstriction, hypoxia also causes proliferation of the smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall. Both phenomena lead to a decrease in luminal cross-sectional area and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance index with pulmonary hypertension (PH) as a consequence.",

A negative result from a PCR test can occur when organisms in circulation are below the level of detection, as may happen when infections are chronic. It has been demonstrated that dogs can be PCR negative on blood samples, but PCR positive on splenic aspirates [21] . It is hypothesized that the E. canis are sequestered in splenic macrophages to avoid immune elimination. Unfortunately, in the present case, the owners declined fine needle aspirates of the spleen due to the potential risks and stress involved, e.g. internal bleeding, aggravation of the dyspnea. Paired serology samples can also provide useful information about antibody kinetics, which may point to current status of infection. A fourfold increase in IgG antibodies over time is suggested to be evidence for an active infection [24] . Antibody titers will decrease gradually after appropriate treatment, but may persist for months to years even after full clinical recovery [23, 25] . In this case, the Ehrlichia IgG titer was still very high 17 days after initiation of doxycycline therapy, probably due to the short time between start of the treatment and retesting; IFAT was unfortunately not repeated on day 50.",

This could explain the pulmonary changes found in this dog and the clinical and radiographic improvement after treatment with doxycycline. However, recently, acute resolution of patchy pulmonary alveolar infiltrates has been described after sildenafil therapy in dogs with idiopathic PH and PH secondary to idiopathic lung fibrosis [30] . Therefore, sildenafil therapy might also have contributed to the improvement of the radiographic changes in this case. Another explanation for the radiographic abnormalities and the improvement on doxycycline therapy that cannot be excluded is that the dog suffered from a bacterial pneumonia.",

In people, it is increasingly recognized that patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension have dysregulated coagulation and antithrombotic homeostasis, which may contribute to a prothrombotic state [33] . Unfortunately, we did not perform diagnostic investigations such as D-dimer concentration [34] , computed tomography pulmonary angiography [35] or thromboelastography (TEG) [36, 37] to investigate if the dog suffered from PTE or a prothrombotic state.

If the PH is not controlled by primary disease therapy or if the PH is idiopathic, treatment with pulmonary arterial dilators may be implemented. In veterinary medicine currently, only phosphodiesterase inhibitors are used. Sildenafil is a highly selective phosphodiesterase five inhibitor that has been used in veterinary medicine with encouraging results [30, 40] . Pimobendan, a calcium-sensitizing agent with phosphodiesterase three inhibiting actions has also been used, especially when left heart disease is a contributing cause [41] . In the present case, a dual therapy with pulmonary arterial dilators was initiated, because we hoped this would ameliorate the very severe PH and clinical signs faster than a monotherapy with sildenafil. Although recovery has been described in a similar case with just a monotherapy with doxycycline [19] , we believe that the symptomatic support with pulmonary vasodilators was justified in this dog. Mild to moderate improvement of tricuspid regurgitation gradient by sildenafil therapy has been described in some dogs with PH [30] , but not in others [42] . Consequently, we cannot rule out that the improvement of the echocardiographic changes could also be partially explained by the use of the vasodilating drugs. Ideally, another echocardiogram should have been performed after discontinuation of the vasodilator therapy. However, the improvement was so dramatic, that we do not believe that this could be solely explained by the vasodilator therapy.",
