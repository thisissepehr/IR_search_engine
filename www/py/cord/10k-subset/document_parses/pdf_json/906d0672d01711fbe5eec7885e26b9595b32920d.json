So far, the expression of capsid and envelope proteins in infected cells has been considered an absolute requirement for alphavirus budding and propagation. In the present study, we show that Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus lacking the capsid gene can propagate in mammalian and insect cells. This propagation is mediated by the release of infectious microvesicles (iMVs), which are pleomorphic and have a larger size and density than wild-type virus. iMVs, which contain viral RNA inside and viral envelope proteins on their surface, are released at the plasma membrane and infect cells using the endocytic pathway in a similar way to wild-type virus. iMVs are not pathogenic in immunocompetent mice when injected intravenously, but can infect different organs like lungs and heart. Finally, we also show that alphavirus genomes without capsid can mediate the propagation of heterologous genes, making these vectors potentially interesting for gene therapy or vaccination studies. The minimalist infectious system described in this study shows that a self-replicating RNA able to express membrane proteins with binding and fusion properties is able to propagate, providing some insights into virus evolution.",

Among alphaviruses, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SIN), and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEE) have been characterized as the most representative members of this genus. Although SFV and SIN are able to infect and produce disease in humans, VEE and other closely related alphaviruses can cause lethal encephalitis and are considered a significant public health threat in many areas of South, Central and North America. However, massive outbreaks of the SFV-related alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV) in Indian Ocean islands and Asia, and more recently in the Americas, has produced a high morbidity, drawing worldwide attention to this type of viruses [1, 2] .",

            "text": "Alphaviruses contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 11-12 kb that is packaged into a nucleocapsid (NC) of icosahedral symmetry (T = 4) formed by 240 subunits of the capsid protein [3] . The NC is enveloped by a lipid bilayer containing 240 heterotrimers of glycoproteins E1 and E2, which mediate virus entry into target cells [4] . Viral entry takes place through endocytosis followed by low pH-mediated fusion of viral envelope and endosome membranes, disassembly of NC, and release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm (for a review see [5] ). Upon cell entry, viral RNA is translated to produce the replicase (Rep), formed by four nonstructural protein subunits (nsP1-4), which is able to synthesize a complementary minus-sense genomic RNA (-RNA) during the early phase of infection. Then, Rep uses this -RNA as template to amplify viral genomes and to synthesize a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), which is translated to produce a large structural polyprotein (capsid-p62-6K-E1). The capsid protein contains a serine protease activity, which is responsible for its auto-proteolytical cleavage from the nascent chain. The rest of the polyprotein is processed in the ER into three envelope proteins (p62, 6K, and E1), which are then translocated to the plasma membrane. p62 and E1 associate to form heterotrimers and at a late stage of the transport process p62 is cleaved by the host enzyme furin, thus generating the E2 form and a small glycoprotein called E3. E2 and E1 constitute the mature viral spikes [5] . E3 is lost in SIN, but remains on the virion surface in SFV. In both SFV and SIN, the initial 100-200 nucleotides of the capsid gene function as a translation enhancer, leading to very high levels of viral structural proteins in infected cells [6, 7] . The generation of new viral particles (VPs) involves two processes that have been studied in great detail: (1) packaging of viral RNAs into NCs and (2) budding of NCs at the plasma membrane. The capsid protein can assemble into NCs through specific interactions between capsid monomers and between these monomers and genomic viral RNA [8] [9] [10] [11] . Neither the -RNA nor the sgRNA are usually packaged into VPs, because they lack a specific packaging sequence located within the Rep gene.",

To construct pSFV-spike and pSFV-enh-spike, a fragment of 3.9 or 4.2 kb containing the sequence including ''subgenomic promoter ? p62-6K-E1 ? 3 0 UTR'' was obtained from pSFV-helper-E [22] or pSFV-helper-S2, respectively, by digestion with Xba I ? Spe I and inserted into pSFV-1 digested with the same enzymes. pSFV-spike has the same structure as the one previously described [17] . In pSFVenh-spike, the ORF p62-6K-E1 is fused to the sequence coding for the first 34 amino acids of the capsid (translation enhancer b1) using the foot and mouth disease virus 2A autoprotease as a linker [22, 24] . To construct pSFV-enh-spikeD6K, plasmid pSFV-enh-spike was digested with NdeI and the 2.1 kb fragment spanning from position 708 in p62 to position 1171 in E1 genes was substituted by a synthetic fragment (Genescript, Piscataway, NJ) of 1.9 kb covering the same area, but in which the 6K sequence was completely deleted, as previously described [23] . To construct pSFV-enh-spike-GFP, we first generated an intermediate plasmid containing a multiple cloning site (mcs) between the end of the E1 gene and the 3 0 UTR (pSFV-enh-spikemcs) (information available upon request). A PCR fragment spanning the sequence from the subgenomic promoter to the end of 3 0 UTR was obtained from pSFV-GFP (kindly provided by Prof. P. Liljestr\u00f6m, Karolinska Institute, Sweden) and cloned into pSFV-enh-spike-mcs digested with Avr II (present in the mcs) and Spe I. To construct pSIN-spike, a PCR fragment containing SIN p62-6K-E1 sequence was obtained using primers 5 0 -TCTAGACCACCATGTCCGCA GCACCACTGGTCAC-3 0 (forward) and 5 0 -GGGCCCTCA TCTTCGTGTGCTAGTC-3 0 (reverse), using plasmid DHBB(5 0 SIN) as template [21] . In the forward primer, an ATG (underlined) and a ribosome-binding site (bold) were included, since they are not present in the p62 sequence. The 2.9 kb PCR fragment was digested with Xba I and Apa I (in italics in the forward and reverse primers, respectively) and cloned into the same sites in pSINrep5 [21] . A pSin-Rep5 vector expressing GFP was used for in vitro transcription of SIN-GFP RNA (kindly provided by T. Furuta, Kyoto University, Japan).",

            "text": "An SFV vector containing the sequence of SFV envelope proteins (p62-6K-E1) fused to the minimal SFV capsid translation enhancer (SFV-enh-spike) was initially constructed as a tool to generate a polyclonal antiserum against SFV envelope proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This vector was packaged into VPs by co-transfecting BHK-21 (BHK) cells with SFV-enh-spike and SFVhelper-C-S219A RNAs, the latter lacking the SFV packaging signal and providing the capsid gene in trans [22] (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In this last RNA, the S219A mutation in the capsid abolishes its proteolytic activity, preventing the processing of the structural polyprotein if a full-length genome is generated by recombination [22] . Unexpectedly, SFV-enh-spike VPs were able to mediate the spreading of viral protein expression in monolayers of different mammalian cell lines including BHK, Hep3B, HuH-7, and the mosquito cell line C6/36 ( Fig. 1 ). This effect was not due to the generation of replication-proficient virus (RPV), since no RPVs were detected by a plaque-forming unit (PFU) assay. In addition, propagation of this vector was not as efficient as that of wtSFV (Fig. 1b) . However, to rule out that recombinant genomes containing all or part of the capsid gene could have been generated during the packaging of SFV-enh-spike, BHK cells were electroporated only with SFV-enh-spike RNA, and co-cultured with non-electroporated cells at a 1:20 ratio (Fig. 2a) . As shown in Fig. 2b , SFV-enh-spike was able to propagate from transfected cells to neighbouring cells, reaching most cells in the monolayer at 36 h. p.i. This effect was not observed in a co-culture of cells electroporated with SFV-LacZ RNA (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), which gives a pattern of individual cells at all analysed time points (Fig. 2b ). As observed with infected cells, the propagation of wtSFV from transfected cells was also more efficient than that of SFV-enh-spike (Fig. 2c ). Fig. 1 Propagation of SFV devoid of capsid in different cell lines. a SFV RNA genomes devoid of capsid (SFV-enhspike or SFV-spike, abbreviated in the diagram as SFV-DC) were packaged into VPs by coelectroporation of BHK cells with a helper RNA able to provide the SFV capsid in trans (SFV-helper-C-S219A, abbreviated as SFV-helper-C). SFV-LacZ VPs were generated by co-electroporation of BHK cells with SFV-LacZ RNA and two helper RNAs providing the SFV capsid and envelope proteins in trans, respectively [22] (not shown in the diagram). VPs were collected at 24 h postelectroporation and used to infect monolayers of BHK cells (b) or the indicated cell lines (c) at MOI 0.05. Cells were fixed at the indicated times and analysed by immunofluorescence (IF) with a polyclonal antiserum specific for the nsP2 subunit of SFV Rep (a-nsp2) (b), or with a polyclonal antiserum specific for SFV envelope proteins (aspikes) (c). Images correspond to a representative experiment from at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate with similar results. Magnification of images: 9200 (except for images of C6/36 cells that were taken at 9400). Scale bar in all images: 50 lm SFV-enh-spike expresses the first 34 amino acids of the capsid, which according to many studies are insufficient to form functional NCs [8] . However, to discard any possible implication of capsid fragments in propagation, we constructed an SFV vector that expresses the envelope proteins without any capsid sequence (SFV-spike, Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). The absence of capsid expression from this vector, as well as from SFV-enh-spike, was confirmed by Western blot analysis of cells electroporated with their respective RNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). SFV-spike was able to propagate after electroporation of vector RNA into BHK cells co-cultured with non-electroporated cells, demonstrating that propagation of SFV can take place in the complete absence of capsid sequences (Fig. 2b) . This process was also observed in cells infected with SFV-spike VPs packaged as described for SFV-enh-spike (Fig. 1b) . Propagation appeared to be more efficient when using the SFV-enh-spike RNA, indicating that overexpression of To assess whether this phenomenon takes place in other alphaviruses, a SIN vector expressing its envelope proteins and with the whole capsid sequence deleted was also constructed (SIN-spike, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). SIN-spike was also able to propagate very efficiently in co-cultures of vector RNA-electroporated and non-electroporated BHK cells (Fig. 2d) . In contrast, a SIN vector in which the structural genes were replaced by GFP, used as control (SIN-GFP, Supplementary Fig. 1) , was unable to propagate. The small 6K envelope protein was also dispensable for propagation, since an SFV-enh-spike vector RNA in which the 6K sequence had been deleted (SFV-enh-spikeD6K, Supplementary Fig. 1 ) was also able to propagate in cocultures of vector RNA-electroporated and non-electroporated BHK cells (Fig. 2e) . This vector was able to express levels of spike proteins that were similar to those of SFVspike ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ), but did not express 6K (data not shown). These results show that propagation of alphavirus can take place even if only Rep and spike glycoproteins p62 and E1 genes are present in the viral genome.",

The role of envelope proteins was supported by the fact that transmission of the SFV-enhspike vector was inhibited by incubating infected cells with a murine polyclonal antiserum against the SFV envelope proteins, a phenomenon that was also observed in cells infected with wtSFV, used as positive control (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, in both cases, propagation was not inhibited when cells were incubated with preimmune serum, used as negative control. Since the spike proteins are able to mediate the fusion of membranes, one possible mechanism for the propagation of SFV without capsid could be the fusion of cells expressing the envelope proteins with neighbouring cells. However, the fusogenic activity of SFV-spike proteins requires a pH \\ 6 [33] , which was not detected in the extracellular medium of infected or transfected cultures (data not shown). Additionally, syncytia were not observed in cell monolayers infected with SFVenh-spike in which the vector had propagated (Fig. 3b) . This result was confirmed by labelling cellular plasma membranes with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with a fluorescent dye (Supplementary Fig. 3) . Nevertheless, when these monolayers were incubated at pH 5, during a few minutes syncytia were induced very efficiently, suggesting that fusion does not take place under normal cell culture conditions (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 3) . A similar outcome was observed in cells infected with wtSFV, although in this case viral propagation to most cells led to a general fusion of the monolayer at pH 5. As expected, syncytia were not observed in cell monolayers infected with SFV-LacZ when incubated at pH 5.",

We analysed the presence of infectious material in the supernatant of mammalian or mosquito cell lines transfected with an SFV RNA devoid of the capsid. As shown in Fig. 4a , all cell lines electroporated with SFV-enh-spike RNA were able to produce infectious material at a level of 10 3 -10 5 infection units (IU)/ml/24 h, with the highest titres being produced by HuH-7 cells. Interestingly, the infectious material produced by transfected cells was also able to propagate after infection of new cell monolayers, as shown by a dramatic increase in the number of cells expressing the spike proteins between 6 and 40 h p.i. (Fig. 4b) . No infectious material was detected in cells electroporated with SFV-LacZ. Furthermore, the infection material was able to transfer SFV RNA into infected cells, with cellular viral RNA levels increasing approximately 15-fold between 6 and 24 h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 4) , while viral RNA levels in cells infected with a non-propagative SFV vector expressing GFP (SFV-GFP, Supplementary Fig. 1 ) did not show a significant increase. As observed earlier, propagation was more efficient in cells infected with wtSFV, in which cellular viral RNA levels increased [3000 fold during a similar time interval. These data conclusively demonstrate that SFV devoid of capsid can propagate in a way similar to an infectious virus.",

While RNAse treatment had no effect on their infectivity, both proteinase K and Triton X-100 were able to almost completely block infectivity (Fig. 4c) . These data suggest that the infectious material contains viral RNA within an envelope that has the spike glycoproteins on its surface. For this reason from now on, we will refer to this material as infectious microvesicles (iMVs). Furthermore, the infectivity of iMVs was strongly inhibited in the presence of a lysosomotropic agent (20 mM NH 4 Cl), which is able to accumulate in lysosomes (Fig. 4c) . If this agent was present only during a 60 min viral adsorption period, iMV infection was inhibited by 88.2 %, which was comparable to wtSFV infectivity inhibition (96.8 %). This inhibition was even higher if NH 4 Cl was present during the adsorption and a 4-h post-infection period, reaching[99 % for both iMVs and wtSFV. However, if NH 4 Cl was added after the adsorption period, the infectivity was only modestly inhibited (23.7 and 26.2 % inhibition for iMVs and wtSFV, respectively). These data suggest that iMVs use a mechanism of entry that requires acidification of endosomes in a similar way to wtSFV [34] .",

Interestingly, iMVs produced a much stronger signal for E1 and E2 than SFV VPs (notice that in Fig. 5a , the gel was loaded with 5 9 10 7 VPs of SFV-LacZ and 10 5 IU of iMVs to obtain a comparable signal).

In contrast, enrichment in iMVs of Na ? K ? ATPase, a ubiquitously expressed oligomeric plasma membrane complex, indicates that they are likely generated at the cytoplasmic membrane ( Supplementary  Fig. 5a ). To confirm this possibility, we transfected HuH-7 cells with SFV-enh-spike RNA, labelled them with [ 35 S] methionine-cysteine, and performed cell surface biotinylation as described [36] . We then allowed the release of iMVs from cells during 18 h and incubated the supernatant with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 , we were able to visualize SFV-spike proteins only in streptavidin-retrieved supernatants derived from cells in which we had performed cell surface biotinylation, strongly suggesting that iMVs are generated at the plasma membrane. To obtain additional evidence of iMVs budding at the plasma membrane, we performed thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of cells transduced with SFV-spike. These cells showed some 100-to 150-nm spherical structures that sometimes appeared to be attached to the cell surface by a small ''neck'' and that could represent iMVs budding from the plasma membrane ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . wtSFV-infected cells used as control showed numerous VPs of 60-70 nm on the cell surface.",

A sample containing 10 6 purified SFV-LacZ VPs was used as positive control (VP).

The density of each fraction was calculated by measuring its refractive index (dashed line, right Y-axis scale).

Pretreatment of iMV samples with Triton X-100 resulted in almost complete elimination of SFV RNA upon RNAse treatment, confirming that the viral RNA is included in a lipid vesicle (Fig. 5b) . The relative amount of protected SFV RNA in iMVs was about 60-fold higher than that observed in SFV VPs used as control, probably due to a higher particle-to-infectivity ratio in iMVs (for this analysis, we used the same amount of infectious units for both types of materials). To our surprise, the protected SFV RNA was also detected in the material purified from cells electroporated with SFV-LacZ, although at lower levels. This suggests that microvesicles containing viral RNA could be produced in the absence of spikes, although in this case they would not be infectious, as spike glycoproteins are required for propagation. iMVs mostly contained plus-strand SFV RNA, as determined by strand-specific RT-qPCR ( Fig. 5d ) although minus-strand RNA was also detected in iMVs. However, the relative levels of minus-strand RNA were low and comparable to those present in transfected cells. In fact, the plus-strand/minus-strand RNA ratios in cells and iMVs were not significantly different (p = 0.057), suggesting that the minus-strand RNA is not enriched in iMVs. Moreover, cellular mRNAs corresponding to GAPDH and b-actin were detected in purified iMVs before RNAse treatment, but only the latter one, which seemed to be more abundant in cells (Fig. 5c) , was detected in RNAse-treated iMVs, suggesting that the cellular level of an mRNA could determine its inclusion into iMVs.",

To test if the SFV genome devoid of capsid was able to allow the expression and transmission of foreign genes, the ORF coding for GFP was cloned into the SFV-enh-spike vector downstream of a second subgenomic promoter (SFV-enh-spike-GFP, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). SFV-enhspike-GFP RNA was efficiently packaged into VPs when co-transfected into BHK cells together with SFV-helper-C-S219A RNA. When these VPs were used to infect cell monolayers at low MOI, the number of GFP-expressing cells increased along time leading to both spike and GFP expression in a high proportion of cells at 30 h p.i. (Fig. 8a) . In contrast, a non-propagative SFV-GFP vector used as control resulted in a pattern of individual GFPexpressing cells at all times tested. Accordingly, flow cytometry analysis showed a considerable increase ([5 fold at 24 h p.i.) in the percentage of GFP-positive cells when they were infected with SFV-enh-spike-GFP (Fig. 8b) , indicating that this vector was able to transmit the GFP gene in cell monolayers. A similar result was observed in a co-culture experiment performed with cells electroporated with SFV-enh-spike-GFP RNA mixed with non-electroporated cells (data not shown). This result indicates that alphavirus genomes without capsid can incorporate foreign genes and propagate their expression together with viral genes.",

            "text": "The role of the nucleocapsid revisited It has been previously shown that propagation of alphaviruses requires expression of envelope and capsid proteins in the same cells [17] . It was later demonstrated that specific interactions between NCs and the cytoplasmic tail of E2 protein were necessary for budding of VPs and propagation [43] . In the present study, we have demonstrated that alphaviruses devoid of capsid sequences can also propagate in cell monolayers. For this purpose, we engineered alphavirus genomes in which the whole capsid gene was deleted (SFV-spike and SIN-spike), or in which the first 34 amino acids of the capsid (translation enhancer) were fused in frame with the sequence coding for the envelope polyprotein (SFV-enh-spike). This last strategy, which was used to increase the expression of envelope proteins, led to a more pronounced propagation of the vector. Although SFV-enh-spike is able to express a small capsid fragment, we can rule out that this peptide could mediate the formation of functional NCs, since it lacks all domains necessary for NC assembly and budding. These missing domains include most of the amino-terminal domain (residues 1-118), which mediates binding of capsid to viral RNA, and the carboxy-terminal domain (residues 119-267) needed for NC assembly and budding [14] . Although the amino-terminal domain can tolerate large deletions [8] the carboxy-terminal domain is essential for NC assembly and budding [43] . Furthermore, the fact that both SFV-spike and SIN-spike were able of propagating in cell monolayers demonstrates that no capsid sequences are involved in this phenomenon. Interestingly, the propagation of SFV-spike had not been observed previously, even though this vector had been used in early studies to show that both envelope and capsid proteins are necessary for budding and production of VPs [17] . A possible explanation of these apparent antithetic results lays in the fact that in those studies, cells infected with SFV-spike VPs were analysed only at early times post-infection (8-10 h), when propagation was still not evident (Fig. 1b) . 6 Electron microscopy of iMVs. Purified iMVs were incubated with an antiserum specific for SFV envelope proteins, followed by incubation with a gold-labelled secondary antibody and visualized by negative staining (a-g). Representative images of iMVs present before sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (a, b) or in the indicated fractions after gradient purification (c-g) are shown.

            "text": "The propagation of alphavirus genomes without capsid sequences seems to be mediated by the expression of envelope proteins, since the vector was unable to propagate in the presence of an antiserum raised against these proteins. The envelope proteins include the E1 and E2 mature proteins that form the viral spikes and the small 6K protein, which is not necessary for spike formation but is involved in the correct assembly and release of VPs [23] . A possible contribution of 6K to the propagation of SFV genomes without capsid sequences was discarded when we observed that an SFV genome lacking both the capsid and 6K proteins (SFV-enh-spikeD6K) was also able to spread in cell monolayers. This vector, which was engineered by fusing the p62 and E1 genes as previously described [44] , was able to express levels of spike proteins comparable to those of SFV-spike ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , indicating that the mutated polyprotein was correctly processed. A formal possibility for the propagation of capsiddeleted alphavirus could be the fusion of cells expressing functional spikes with neighbouring cells. However, we did not observe fusion events under normal cell culture conditions (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It has been described that SFV-infected cells can fuse to each other, but only when they are exposed to an acidic pH [45] . We were able to reproduce this phenomenon by incubating infected or transfected cell monolayers at pH 5. This result confirmed that these cells were expressing functional spikes on their surface, since only correctly folded spikes Fig. 7 Analysis of iMV pathogenicity and infectivity in mice. a, b For pathogenicity studies, C57BL/6 mice were intravenously injected with 10 6 IU of iMVs, 10 5 PFU of wtSFV or saline (n = 5).

            "text": "Thus, propagation of alphavirus genomes devoid of capsid can be explained either by some sort of cell-to-cell transmission process, or by the release of infectious material to the extracellular medium. Regarding the first possibility, it has been recently shown that cell-to-cell transfer of SIN VPs can be mediated by filopodia-like extensions induced in infected cells [46] . However, this kind of transmission required interactions between spike and capsid proteins, making this process unlikely in the absence of the latter protein. Furthermore, in our study we demonstrate that cells transfected with SFV devoid of capsid are able to produce infectious material in different cell types. This material is formed by heterogeneous microvesicles that contain protected viral RNA and display spike proteins on their surface. Interestingly, these iMVs infect cells using the endocytic pathway, in a similar way to wt alphavirus (Fig. 4c) and are able to propagate from initially infected cells to neighbouring cells (Fig. 4b) . However, the production of iMVs is not very efficient, reaching a maximum titre of 10 5 IU/ml in HuH-7 cells, which is about three-four orders of magnitude lower than the reported production of wtSFV VPs in mammalian cells [47] . This low titre could explain why propagation of vectors without capsid is much less efficient than that of the wt virus (Figs. 1b, 2b, c, Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Despite the low production of iMVs, both quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot experiments indicate that the amount of viral RNA and envelope proteins per infection unit is higher in iMVs compared to SFV VPs (Fig. 5a, b) . The higher RNA level/infection unit in iMVs could indicate that each iMV incorporates several copies of viral RNA, but alternatively it could also indicate that the ''particle-to-infectivity ratio'' is higher for iMVs. The higher envelope proteins level/ infection unit in iMVs might be a reflection of the larger size of iMVs compared to VPs, but it could also be due to a higher ''particle-to-infectivity ratio'' for iMVs. Although further studies are needed to clarify these possibilities, we cannot discard that a proportion of iMVs produced by transfected cells might be defective in infection. Previous studies had shown that an SFV vector devoid of all viral structural proteins, but expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein could also propagate in cell culture [48] . This chimeric SFV-VSV vector was also able to release infectious vesicles containing viral RNA and expressing VSV-G protein on their surface. Recently, using an elegant in vitro evolution assay, it has been found that the appearance of several mutations in the SFV Rep increases the production of infectious SFV-VSV-G vesicles [49] . Interestingly, vesicles produced by these mutants are derived from viral RC spherules that get trapped on the cell surface. Whether these mutations could also increase the production of iMVs derived from SFV genomes devoid of capsid deserves further investigation.",

However, these microvesicles would be unable to infect cells, since they lack the glycoproteins necessary for binding and fusion to cell membranes. SFV packaging of viral RNA into VPs requires specific interactions between the capsid and a packaging signal present in viral RNA, and between the capsid and the E2 cytoplasmic tail. Since none of these interactions are possible in the absence of capsid, the inclusion of RNAs into iMVs should be therefore mediated by a different mechanism. The observation that b-actin RNA was detected in iMVs at low levels (Fig. 5b) suggests that packaging might be nonspecific and only highly abundant RNAs are efficiently incorporated into iMVs. The fact that envelope proteins from a different virus, like VSV-G [48] , can also mediate this incorporation excludes specific interactions between RNA and SFV-spike glycoproteins.",

We also evaluated the possibility that iMVs could derive from RCs. However, this hypothesis was not supported by several observations: (1) we were unable to significantly detect nsPs 1, 2, 3, and 4 in iMVs ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ), suggesting that the whole Rep complex, which is an important component of RCs [40] , is not present within iMVs; (2) iMVs contain mostly plus-strand RNA, with very low relative minus-strand RNA levels (Fig. 5d) , suggesting that double-stranded RNA, an intermediate product of RNA replication that is generated in RCs, is not abundant in iMVs. These data strongly support that the novel infectious vesicles described in this study, unlike those produced by SFV-VSV [49] , are not derived from RCs, suggesting that alphavirus genomes could use different mechanisms of propagation in the absence of capsid.",

We were able to show that this was the case by introducing the GFP reporter gene into SFV-enh-spike genome. These results, together with the fact that iMVs can infect different organs in vivo, suggest that this kind of new vectors could be useful for vaccination or gene therapy. In particular, alphavirus-derived iMVs could be interesting for vaccination against pathogenic members of this group of viruses, like CHIKV, given Fig. 9 Schematic model of alphavirus propagation in the absence of capsid. Once the alphavirus RNA genome without capsid (alphavirus-DC) is delivered to the cytoplasm of a cell, it will replicate leading to the production of many genomic (gRNA) and subgenomic (sgRNA) copies. The envelope glycoproteins E1 and p62 will be translated from sgRNAs at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they will form heterodimers that will be transported to the plasma membrane through Golgi. In late Golgi, p62 will mature to E2 by furin cleavage, rendering the spikes functional for fusion. iMVs will form when gRNAs get trapped inside pleomorphic microvesicles which are generated by budding at the plasma membrane. These iMVs, which have functional spikes on their surface, can interact with alphavirus receptors on neighbouring cells and enter them through endocytosis. The low pH of endosomes will trigger conformational changes on the spike glycoproteins, leading to the fusion of the iMV membrane and the endosome, resulting in the release of gRNA to the cytoplasm the fact that they can express very high levels of their own envelope proteins. In fact, it has been recently reported that a CHIKV vector based on a viral genome lacking the capsid gene (a construct very similar to our SFV-spike construct) was able to induce anti-CHIKV antibody and T cell responses similar to those obtained by single immunizations with wtCHIKV [61, 62] . It is enticing to consider that the potency of this type of vaccine vector could also lie in the production of iMVs, which would increase the number of infected cells and hence also antiviral immune responses.",

This low production of iMVs could, however, be circumvented by packaging SFV vectors carrying spike and heterologous genes into VPs, providing the capsid protein in trans (as described in ''Materials and methods'' for the production of SFV-enh-spike-GFP VPs). These VPs are produced at much higher levels than iMVs (we routinely obtained [10 8 VPs/ml for SFV-enh-spike-GFP), can infect and mediate the propagation of heterologous gene expression in cell culture (Fig. 8) , and could be used to deliver propagation-competent alphavirus vectors in vivo in a more efficient way.",

This remarkable phenomenon allows spreading of a self-replicating RNA through the production of pleomorphic microvesicles that are assembled at the plasma membrane. These microvesicles contain spike glycoproteins on their surface and are capable of infecting neighbouring cells through endocytosis in a similar way to wt virus (Fig. 9 ). Although this new mechanism of viral transmission is less efficient than the one used by the parental virus, it could also contribute to its propagation. In addition, we speculate that this minimalist infectious system resembles a primitive alphavirus ancestor not yet complemented by an NC, providing some clues for virus evolution.",
