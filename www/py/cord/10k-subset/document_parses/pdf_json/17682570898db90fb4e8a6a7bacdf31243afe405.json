As might be expected, identical strains have also accounted for less serious infections, such as cellulitis, pharyngitis, and even asymptomatic carriage.

            "text": "As remarkable as the emergence of invasive group A streptococcal infections has been, the persistence of such infections worldwide is equally unusual. The increased incidence of severe group A streptococcal infections during the later part of the 1990s suggests that the prevalent strains, largely M-1 and M-3 strains, have the ability to persist in the human environment for indefinite periods. In fact, these strains have been widely distributed for decades as causes of simple pharyngitis and asymptomatic carriage. Thus, much of the world's population has been exposed to these strains, likely on numerous occasions. Despite this exposure and the type-specific immunity that should be generated, the increasing prevalence of M-1 strains in certain regions is troubling. For example, in Norway 4 and Sweden, 5 the recent prevalence of M-1 strains among invasive streptococcal infections, as well as pharyngeal isolates, has increased to greater than 70%. From the theoretical perspective, the high prevalence and persistence of such strains could be due to an absence of protective immunity in a significant portion of the human population, or could be due to changes in protective epitopes in the organism analogous to antigenic drift among influenza viruses. There is some data supporting the latter hypothesis. Although restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of M-type 1 strains suggest that these strains have remained identical over a 10year period, biophysical studies imply that this may not be the case. For example, de Malmanche and Martin, 6 using functional studies of opsonophagocytosis, demonstrated that immunity may only be strain, and not M-type, specific. In some of these strains, marked differences in the amino acid sequence of M-1 strains was apparent, despite the fact that these strains were serologically typed as M-1. In addition, Villasenor 7 has demonstrated that, among 75 strains of M-1 group A streptococci, susceptibility to opsonophagocytosis in the presence of a single polyclonal anti-M-1 sera followed a normal distribution curve, and that some M-type 1 strains were no better opsonized than heterologous, non-M-1 strains. Representative strains, selected on the basis of their susceptibility to phagocytosis, had differences in the sequence of M-protein in both the hypervariable region and the A-repeat regions of the molecule. Clearly, these changes did not affect the structure enough to alter the serologic M-type, but were sufficient to affect opsonization with convalescent sera. Thus, subtle differences in the surface structure of M-1 protein render some strains resistant to immune sera, suggesting that antigenic drift could account for the high prevalence and persistence of M-1 strains for the past 15 years.",

M-protein, streptolysin O (SLO), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and B (SPEA, SPEB) have been implicated as important virulence factors. However, none of these has been associated with all invasive cases. For example, although M-types 1 and 3 have been most common, M-types 12, 28, and non-typeable strains have been also associated with invasive streptococcal infection. 8 Similarly, in the United States, M-type 1 strains containing the gene for SPEA have been commonly associated with StrepTSS; however, only about 50% of these strains produce SPEA. 9 Thus, no single surface component or extracellular toxin has, thus far, been identified that correlates with the recent increase in virulence in group A streptococcus. In 1997, we reported a strong association between isolates from invasive disease, regardless of M-type, and the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADase). 10 In contrast, isolates that are most commonly associated with rheumatic fever, i.e., Mtypes 5 and 18, did not produce NADase. 10 Throat isolates associated with uncomplicated symptomatic pharyngitis were most commonly M-types 1, 12, and 4, 8 and 100% of these isolates from the early 1980s to the present time were NADase producers. 10 This is not surprising, because the source of bacteria in invasive streptococcal infections is frequently the throat.",

Our genetic analysis demonstrated that all strains of group A streptococci, regardless of their ability to produce NADase, possess the NADase gene, nga, and that all isolates examined were more than 96% identical in nga and upstream regulatory sequences. 15 Further, because NADasenegative strains did not produce any immunoreactive protein or peptide fragment, we concluded that additional regulatory element(s) control NADase production. 15 Taken together, these findings suggest that, in the early 1980s, serotype M-1 underwent a stable genetic change, resulting in the ability to produce NADase. Further, acquisition of this trait occurred in temporal association with the emergence of M-type 1 group A streptococcus as the predominant serotype associated with severe invasive infections. 8, 16, 17 NADase's role in pathogenesis is currently under study.",

It is most common following hemolytic streptococcal infections caused by groups A, C, and G streptococci. Red streaks beginning at the margin of skin infection and extending proximally are easily recognized and may extend several inches per hour. Thus, lymphangitis associated with a softtissue infection is likely a marker for a more aggressive strain of streptococci, and its recognition should prompt aggressive antibiotic therapy and close observation for evidence of bacteremia. attributed to streptococci, other organisms, including anaerobic and aerobic mouth flora, commonly contribute. Still, the group A streptococcus was found alone or in combination with other organisms in 100% of tonsils removed from 45 different children. 20 In some cases, extension of infection from the tonsil to adjacent cervical nodes, the peritonsillar soft tissues of the neck, or the retropharyngeal space results in necrotizing infections or abscess, which require surgical drainage or debridement. Peritonsillar abscesses are readily cured with penicillin plus needle aspiration. 21 Like streptococcal pharyngitis, retropharyngeal abscess is most common in children less than 6 years to age. These infections may be caused by group A streptococcus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, or Staphylococcus aureus. Aggressive imaging of the neck, with computerized axial tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and emergent surgical consultation, are critically important because of the likelihood of upper airway obstruction, bacteremia, and extension of infection along complex fascial planes.",

Several years later, Meleney 33 described 20 patients with hemolytic streptococcal gangrene in China, and he argued that this entity was different from erysipelas and should have a different name. These cases were probably caused by group A streptococci as we now know them, although at that time they only characterized the organism as hemolytic streptococci. Subsequently, \"necrotizing fasciitis\" has become the term that is preferred, because bacteria other than streptococci, such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria can produce a similar pathologic process. Meleney's descriptions of the progression are clinically useful and are summarized as follows:",

Within 24 hours of the initial lesion, there is aggressive development of swelling, heat, erythema and tenderness with rapid spreading proximally and distally from the original focus. During the next 24-48 hours, the erythema darkens, changing from red to purple and then to blue, and blisters and bullae form which contain clear yellow fluid. On the fourth or fifth day, the purple areas become frankly gangrenous. From the seventh to tenth day, the line of demarcation becomes sharply defined and the dead skin begins to separate at the margins revealing extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue. Up until this time, the patient continues to be febrile, prostration increases and the patient becomes more emaciated. In more severe cases, the process advances rapidly until several large areas of skin have become gangrenous, and the intoxication renders the patient dull, unresponsive, mentally cloudy or even delirious. Subsequently, the patient may develop metastatic abscesses, bronchopneumonia or lung abscess. (Adapted from reference 33 ",

In addition, the progression of modern group A streptococcal infections is much more rapid than Meleney described, and frequently patients may die within 48-96 h of the onset of symptoms. 16 Further, these necrotizing processes are more likely to destroy skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, and underlying muscle. For example, in one study, 16 myonecrosis was present in about 50% of patients who had necrotizing fasciitis. These data suggest that modern strains are more virulent.",

Adams et al. 34 documented only 21 cases that had been reported from 1900 to 1985, and Svane 35 found only 4 cases among over 20 000 autopsies. In our series of 20 patients with invasive group A streptococcal infection, 16 1 had myositis alone, 3 had myositis as well as necrotizing fasciitis, and 5 had necrotizing fasciitis alone. Recently, deep soft-tissue infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis and myositis, have also been described in reports from Norway, 4 Sweden, 36 and Canada. 37 Although group A streptococci can infect viable muscle via a direct penetrating injury or surgical incision, in approximately 50% of cases there is no history of such an event. These cases develop spontaneously, or secondary to very minor blunt trauma or muscle strain, and most patients deny antecedent symptomatic pharyngitis or tonsillitis. 4, 16, [34] [35] [36] 38, 39 Thus, translocation of group A streptococci likely occurs from the colonized pharynx to the site of muscle injury via hematogenous or lymphatic spread. Severe pain may be the only presenting symptom, and physical findings early may demonstrate only swelling and erythema, although patients may rapidly develop muscle compartment syndromes. 4, 16, [34] [35] [36] [38] [39] [40] In most cases, a single muscle group may be involved; however, because patients are frequently bacteremic, multiple sites of myositis can occur. 16, 34 Distinguishing streptococcal myositis from spontaneous gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens or Clostridium septicum 41 may be difficult, although the presence of crepitus or gas in the tissue would favor clostridial infection. 39 Distinguishing necrotizing fasciitis from myositis is easily done anatomically from surgical exploration or incisional biopsy. In streptococcal cases, many patients may have evidence of both necrotizing fasciitis and myositis. 16, 34 In published series, the case fatality rate for necrotizing fasciitis is between 20% and 50%, whereas group A streptococcal myositis has a fatality rate between 80% and 100%. 16, [34] [35] [36] 38, 39, 41 Aggressive surgical debridement is of extreme importance, because of the poor efficacy of penicillin that has been described in human cases, 16, 34, 35, 38, 39 as well as in experimental streptococcal models of myositis 42, 43 (see section on antibiotic efficacy). Of note, the term \"myositis\" connotes \"inflammation\" of muscle; however, in most cases of streptococcal myositis, frank necrosis is present, with only a paucity of infiltrating inflammatory cells. Thus, a better term would be \"myonecrosis\".",

            "text": "Epidemiology Several population-based studies of StrepTSS have documented the annual incidence of 1-5 cases per 100 000 popu- 44 with most cases being sporadic in nature; however, larger epidemics of invasive group A streptococcal infections have also been described in some settings. In 1994, an epidemic of related invasive infections occurred in Wannamingo, Minnesota, 2 with an annualized prevalence of 24 cases per 100 000 population. In Missoula, Montana in 1999, the incidence of invasive infections reached 30 cases per 100 000 population. In addition to community-based infections, invasive group A streptococcal infections have also been described in hospitals, convalescent centers, and among hospital employees and family contacts of patients with invasive infections. 9, 45, 46 Some of these studies have documented the same M-type and identical RFLP patterns in strains from primary and index cases. 9, [45] [46] [47] In addition, carriage of group A streptococcus by healthcare personnel has been associated with the spread of life-threatening group A streptococcal infections in the obstetrics/gynecology and ear-nose-throat wards of American hospitals. 31 Such infections have also originated in outpatient surgical settings and within the home environment. It has been estimated that the risk of secondary cases may be approximately 200 times greater than the risk among the general population. 48 There is ample data from studies conducted over several decades that group A streptococcus is quickly and efficiently transmitted from index cases to susceptible individuals, and that transmission may result in colonization, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, or invasive group A streptococcal infections. The risk for secondary cases is likely related to close or intimate contact and crowding, as well as host factors such as: (1) active viral infections such as varicella or influenza; (2) recent surgical wounds and childbirth (author's unpublished observations); (3) absence of type specific opsonic antibody against the group A streptococcus causing the index case; and (4) absence of neutralizing antibody against pyrogenic exotoxin A or B. 1",

Surgical procedures, such as suction lipectomy, hysterectomy, vaginal delivery, bunionectomy, and bone pinning provide a portal of entry in some cases. Numerous cases have developed within 24-72 h of minor nonpenetrating trauma resulting in hematoma, deep bruise to the calf, or even following muscle strain. 16 Virus infections such as varicella and influenza have provided portals in other cases. 16 In some cases, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may have either masked the presenting symptoms or predisposed to more severe streptococcal infection and shock. 16 Most cases of StrepTSS occur sporadically, although outbreaks of severe group A streptococcal infections have been described in closed environments, such as nursing homes, 49, 50 and hospital environments. 45, 46 Symptoms and signs Twenty percent of patients have an influenza-like syndrome, characterized by fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 16 Fever is the most common presenting sign, although hypothermia may be present in patients with shock. 16 Confusion is present in 55% of patients, and in some, coma or combativeness are manifest. 16 Pain -the most common initial symptom of StrepTSS -is abrupt in onset, severe, 16 and usually precedes tenderness or physical findings. The pain usually involves an extremity, but may also mimic peritonitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, or pericarditis. 16 Eighty percent of patients have clinical signs of soft-tissue infection, such as localized swelling and erythema, which progresses to necrotizing fasciitis or myositis in 70% of cases, requiring surgical debridement, fasciotomy, or amputation. 16 Of the 20% of cases without soft-tissue findings, a variety of clinical presentations were observed, including endophthalmitis, myositis, perihepatitis, peritonitis, myocarditis, and overwhelming sepsis. 16 A diffuse, scarlatinalike erythema is uncommon, occurring in only 10% of cases.",

Dombeck et al. 60 then demonstrated that a clonal variant of M-1 group A streptococcus linked to invasive infections (designated M1inv\u03e9) demonstrated high frequency internalization of cultured HeLa cells, and that this was dependent upon M-protein. In contrast, others have demonstrated that M-1 strains adhered to and invaded epithelial cells less efficiently than other M-types. 61, 62 In addition, Molinari and Chhatwal 61 have demonstrated that, regardless of M-type, strains isolated from invasive cases (blood isolates) exhibited poorer attachment and internalization of epithelial cells than strains isolated from throat or skin.",

            "text": "As described under the discussion on bacterial adherence and penetration, M-protein may serve as a ligand in specific strains of group A streptococcus. Recent studies by Jadoun et al. 70 suggest that both M-protein (M-6) and SfbI may participate in the adherence and invasion of epithelial cells. This is supported by the observation that type-specific sIgA and IgG antibody prevented the adherence and invasion, respectively, of human pharyngeal cells challenged with M-6 strains. 71 In summary, the adherence and penetration of epithelial cells by group A streptococcus is a very complex process, and it is dependent upon the cell type, state of differentiation (e.g., keratinocyte), strain of group A streptococcus, the immune status of the host, and the inflammatory milieu of the host environment. The importance of these latter points is substantiated by the observation that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) reduce the adherence of group A streptococcus to keratinocytes, 72 and by the demonstration that SfbI-vaccinated animals showed 80% and 90% protection against homologous and heterologous intranasal challenge with viable group A streptococcus. 73 Finally, SfbI and SfbII were found in 64% and 36% of strains in the Northern Territory in Australia, and high levels of IgG antibody were found in the sera of 80 subjects with defined streptococcal infections. 74 Mechanisms of shock Pyrogenic exotoxins induce fever in humans and animals, and also participate in shock by lowering the threshold to exogenous endotoxin. 17 Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and B induce human mononuclear cells to synthesize not only TNF\u03b1 75 but also IL-1 76 and IL-6, [76] [77] [78] suggesting that TNF could mediate the fever, shock, and organ failure observed in patients with StrepTSS. 16 Pyrogenic exotoxin C has been associated with mild cases of scarlet fever in the United States (author's observations) and in England. 79 The roles of newly described pyrogenic exotoxins, such as SSA 56 and MF, 58 in the pathogenesis of StrepTSS have not been elucidated.",

            "text": "There is strong evidence suggesting that SPEA, SPEB, and SPEC, as well as a number of staphylococcal toxins (TSST-1, and staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, and C) act as superantigens and stimulate T-cell responses through their ability to bind to both the class II MHC complex of antigen-presenting cells and the V region of the T-cell receptor. 80 The net effect is induction of T-cell proliferation (via an IL-2 mechanism), with the concomitant production of cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF\u03b1, TNF , IL-6, and interferon [IFN]\u03b3) that mediate shock and tissue injury. Recently, Hackett and Stevens 81 demonstrated that SPEA induced both TNF\u03b1 and TNF from mixed cultures of monocytes and lymphocytes, supporting the role of lymphokines (TNF ) in shock associated with strains producing SPEA. Kotb et al. 82 have shown that a digest of M-protein type 6 can also stimulate T-cell responses by this mechanism. Interestingly, quantitation of such V T-cell subsets in patients with acute StrepTSS demonstrated deletion rather than expansion, suggesting that perhaps the lifespan of the expanded subset was shortened by a process of apoptosis. 83 In addition, the subsets deleted were not specific for SPEA, SPEB, SPEC, or MF, suggesting that perhaps an as yet undefined superantigen may play a role in StrepTSS. 83 Cytokine production by less exotic mechanisms may also contribute to the genesis of shock and organ failure. Peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, 84 and killed organisms 85, 86 are capable of inducing TNF\u03b1 production by mononuclear cells in vitro. 17, 86, 87 Exotoxins such as SLO are also potent inducers of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1 . SPEB, a proteinase precursor, has the ability to cleave pre-IL-1 to release preformed IL-1 . 88 Finally, SLO and SPEA together have additive effects in the induction of IL-1 by human mononuclear cells. 81 Whatever the mechanisms, the induction of cytokines in vivo is likely the cause of shock, and SLO, SPEA, SPEB, and SPEC, as well as cell wall components, etc., are potent inducers of TNF and IL-1. 9 Finally, a cysteine protease formed from the cleavage of SPEB may play an important role in pathogenesis by the release of bradykinin from endogenous kininogen and by activating metalloproteases involved in coagulation. 89 The mere presence of virulence factors, such as Mprotein or pyrogenic exotoxins, may be less important in StrepTSS than the dynamics of their production in vivo. For example, Chaussee et al. 9 have demonstrated that, among strains from patients with necrotizing fasciitis and StrepTSS, approximately 40% and around 75% produced SPEA or SPEB, respectively. In addition, the quantity of SPEA, but not of SPEB, was higher for strains from StrepTSS patients compared to with patients with findings in non-invasive disease. 9 Recently, Cleary et al. 90 have proposed a regulon in group A streptococcus that controls the expression of a group of virulence genes coding for virulence factors such as M-protein and C5a-peptidase. Using DNA fingerprinting, Cleary et al. 91 showed differences in M-1 strains isolated from patients with invasive disease compared with M-1 strains from patients with non-invasive group A streptococcal infections. Such strains of group A streptococci could acquire genetic information coding for SPEA via a specific bacteriophage. Multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis demonstrates two patterns, which correspond to M-1 and M-3 type organisms that produce pyrogenic exotoxin A, a finding that fits epidemiologic studies implicating these strains in invasive group A streptococcal infections 54 in the United States.",

In contrast, the timing of pre-treatment with SPEA is crucial, because, as shown by Stevens et al., 94 the pretreatment of mice with SPEA 96 h prior to LPS challenge resulted in protection from LPS-induced shock, probably due to the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10. Finally, Sriskandan et al. 95 have demonstrated that animals immunized with recombinant SPEA have a higher mortality when challenged with a SPEA-producing strain of group A streptococcus than animals that are sham immunized. 95 Further Sriskandan et al. 96 have demonstrated that animals challenged with a SPEA knockout strain of group A streptococcus had greater mortality and greater tissue destruction than animals challenged with the wild-type parent strain.",

            "text": "Thus, the roles of the pyrogenic exotoxins in the pathogenesis of severe group A streptococcal infections are complex and remain to be fully elucidated. However, the importance of cytokine induction in group A streptococcal infections cannot be denied. Hackett et al. 85 have shown that cell wall components from killed invasive and noninvasive strains of group A streptococci elicit significant TNF\u03b1 production by mononuclear cells, exceeding that elicited by SPEA, SPEB, or SLO. 85 Further, viable SLOdeficient, but not viable wild-type, group A streptococci stimulated high levels of TNF\u03b1, suggesting that SLO suppresses the induction of this cytokine, perhaps, in part, because of its cytotoxic effects on host cells. Cytokine induction by cell wall components of the group A streptococcus has also been demonstrated by Muller-Alouf et al. 86 An important role for TNF\u03b1 in the shock associated with severe group A streptococcal infections is also suggested by the remarkable efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against TNF\u03b1 in an experimental streptococcal bacteremia model in non-human primates. 97 The survival of animals was increased by 50%, and markers of organ failure, such as serum creatinine and lactate, were also significantly improved. 97 Other mechanisms of shock and organ failure Recently, Chatellier and Kotb 98 demonstrated that the CG rich motifs of emm1 functioned as superantigens and induced T-cell proliferation. Sriskandan et al. 99 have also demonstrated that inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) may play a role in the shock associated with a group A streptococcal necrotizing soft-tissue infection. In that model, Nmonomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) administration reduced nitrate levels in serum, but did not reduce mortality. 99 The role of streptokinase in invasive group A streptococcal infections has not been extensively studied; however, recent studies demonstrate that certain alleles of streptokinase (ska2) have three energetic folding units which change the tertiary structure of ska into a more lipophilic molecule with high affinity for glomeruli. Only ska2 isogenic mutants are capable of causing kidney lesions with polymorphonuclear lencocyte (PMNL) influx into the glomeruli, as well as deposition of C3. 100 Streptolysin S (SLS) has been known for a long time to be a potent cytotoxin for many different cell types, although it has only recently been implicated as a significant virulence factor. Betschel et al. 101 have demonstrated that insertional activation of the gene controlling SLS resulted in reduced virulence in a mouse model. Recently, Nizet et al. 102 have demonstrated that SLS production is controlled by a contiguous nine-gene locus, sagA to sagI, and that the SLS gene product likely has a structure similar to the bacteriocin family of microbial toxins.",

Nonetheless, clinical failures of penicillin treatment of streptococcal infection do occur, and penicillin fails to eradicate bacteria from the pharynx of patients with documented streptococcal pharyngitis in 5%-20% of patients. [103] [104] [105] Finally, more aggressive group A streptococcal infections (such as necrotizing fasciitis, empyema, burn wound sepsis, subcutaneous gangrene, and myositis) respond less well to penicillin and continue to be associated with high mortality and extensive morbidity. 4, 16, 17, 34, 55, 106, 107 For example, a recent report of 25 cases of streptococcal myositis reported an overall mortality of 85% despite penicillin therapy. 34 Studies in experimental infection have demonstrated that penicillin fails when large numbers of organisms are present. 42, 43 For example, in a mouse model of myositis caused by S. pyogenes, penicillin was ineffective when treatment was delayed for 2 h or more after initiation of infection. 43 Mice receiving clindamycin, however, had survival rates of 100%, 100%, 80%, and 70% when treatment was delayed 0, 2, 6, and 16.5 h, respectively. 43,108 Eagle 42 suggested that penicillin failed in this type of infection because of the \"physiologic state of the organism.\" This phenomenon has recently been attributed to inoculum effects, both in vitro and in vivo. 109, 110 It has also been observed that penicillin and other -lactam antibiotics are most efficacious against rapidly growing bacteria. Early in the stages of infection, or in mild infections, organisms grow rapidly in vivo but are present in rather small numbers. With delays in treatment, higher concentrations of group A streptococci accumulate, and growth begins to slow to a stationary phase. That high concentration of S. pyogenes accumulate in deep-seated infection is supported by the data from Eagle. 42 Why should penicillin lose its efficacy when large numbers of group A streptococci are present or when they are making the transition from logarithmic to stationary growth? Because penicillin mediates its antibacterial action against group A streptococci by intimately interacting with the expressed penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), we compared the PBP patterns from membrane proteins of group A streptococci isolated from different stages of growth, i.e., mid-log-phase and stationary-phase. The binding of radiolabeled penicillin by all PBPs was decreased in stationary cells. In fact, PBPs 1 and 4 were undetectable at 36 h. 109 Thus, the loss of certain PBPs during stationary-phase growth in vitro may be responsible for the inoculum effect observed in vivo, and may account for the failure of penicillin in both experimental and human cases of severe streptococcal infection.",

Radiographs and CT and MRI scans in patients with StrepTSS show soft-tissue swelling and an absence of gas, thus providing clues to the site of the deep infection. Prompt surgical exploration through a small incision, with visualization of muscle and fascia, and timely Gram stain of surgically obtained material provide the earliest and most definitive etiologic diagnosis. 40 Because of intractable hypotension and diffuse capillary leak, massive amounts of intravenous fluids (10-20 l/day) are often necessary, and about 10% of patients have significant clinical improvement. Pressors such as dopamine are used frequently, although no controlled trials have been performed in StrepTSS. In patients with intractable hypotension, vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine have been used, but frequently, symmetrical gangrene of digits results (author's unpublished observations).

A doubleblind study using IVIG is currently underway in northern Europe. Because cytokines are important mediators of shock in StrepTSS, strategies to inhibit or neutralize their effects may provide useful treatments. Recently, a monoclonal antibody against TNF\u03b1 showed promising efficacy in a baboon model of StrepTSS. 97 Finally, anecdotal reports suggest that hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful; however, no controlled studies are underway, nor is it clear if this treatment is useful.",
