We sought to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with lung injury contained mediators that would activate procollagen I promoter and if this activation predicted important clinical outcomes. Design: Prospective controlled study of ALI/ARDS. Setting: Intensive care units and laboratory of a university hospital. Patients and participants: Acute lung injury/ARDS, cardiogenic edema (negative controls) and pulmonary fibrosis (positive controls) patients. Interventions: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected within 48 h of intubation from ALI/ARDS patients. BALF was also collected from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with a procollagen I promoter-luciferase construct and incubated with BALF; procollagen I promoter activity was then measured. BALF active TGF-b1 levels were measured by ELISA. Results: Twenty-nine ARDS patients, nine negative and six positive controls were enrolled. BALF from ARDS patients induced 41% greater procollagen I promoter activation than that from negative controls (p<0.05) and a TGF-b1 blocking antibody significantly reduced this activation in ARDS patients. There was a trend toward higher TGF-b1 levels in the ARDS group compared to negative controls (1.056 log 10 \u20ac 0.1415 vs 1.505 log 10 \u20ac0.1425) (p<0.09). Procollagen I promoter activation was not associated with mortality; however, lower TGF-b1 levels were associated with more ventilator-free and ICU-free days.

Several groups of investigators have detected procollagen I [12, 20, 21] and III [10, 11, 13, 22] in the BALF of patients with ARDS in the first 1-3 days following injury.

To address this question, we developed a bioassay using the full length human PIP in primary human lung fibroblasts. The use of primary cultured cells minimizes the effect of aberrant signaling mechanisms that may be present in immortalized cells. The use of the full length promoter allows for responses to both stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines that may be present in the BALF. Therefore, this system provides direct evidence for factor(s) in BALF from ARDS patients that can activate the PIP and also for the absence of significant inhibitors of this activation. Our bioassay differs from that used by Fahy et al., who transfected the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter [24] driving luciferase into mink lung epithelial cells.
