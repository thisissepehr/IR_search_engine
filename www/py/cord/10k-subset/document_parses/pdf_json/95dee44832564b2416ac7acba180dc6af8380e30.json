However, the monolayer of infected cells treated with 60 g/mL ribavirin remained as intact as that of mockinfected cells. These data indicate that ribavirin prevents virusinduced CPE. The antiviral and protective effects of ribavirin were tested in vivo by assessing its ability to reduce mortality and morbidity in EV71-infected mice. Mice were intraperitoneally infected with M2 and then treated with ribavirin (100 mg/kg) once daily. All infected mice given PBS developed hind limb paralysis with signs of encephalitis manifested by hunched posture, lethargy, ataxia, and anorexia, and only 27% of mice (3/11) survived (figure 3A). The infected mice treated with ribavirin showed a marked reduction in mortality, with a survival rate of 70% (7/10), significantly higher than that in PBS-treated mice (P \u03fd .05, log-rank test). Ribavirin-treated mice did not show obvious symptoms on day 5 after infection, whereas PBS-treated mice began to develop paralysis in their hind limbs (figure 3B). The hind limbs of ribavirin-treated mice were slightly paralyzed, but the severity was significantly less than that in PBS-treated mice from day 5 to day 30 after infection (P \u03fd .05, Wilcoxon test).

            "text": "It has been shown that the brain stem and spinal cord are the main targets of EV71 in severe cases of human infections [1] . Our previous study showed that high levels of virus were detected in the mouse central nervous system on day 5 after infection [13] . Accordingly, we next investigated the viral loads in the mouse central nervous system on day 5 after infection. Our data showed that ribavirin treatment reduced the viral loads in the brains (without brain-stem region), brain stems, and spinal cords of EV71-infected mice (figure 3C). Additional experiments showed that the virus harvested from the tissues of mice receiving ribavirin treatment was still sensitive to ribavirin treatment (data not shown).",

This is the first report that ribavirin, which is currently used to treat several RNA virus infections in patients, has antiviral activities against EV71 in vitro and particularly in vivo by reducing viral loads in tissues, mortality and morbidity during acute infection, and subsequent sequelae in infected mice. This finding is particularly important, because there is no effective antiviral drug currently available for the prevention, treatment, and control of fatal EV71 infection in humans.",

            "text": "Our in vitro experiments showed a direct anti-EV71 action by ribavirin in both human and mouse cell lines. The IC 50 of ribavirin for EV71 is \u03f365 g/mL (266 mol/L) in both RD and SK-N-SH cells, which is lower than that found for other neurotropic viruses, such as Nipah virus, West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (IC 50 values of 100, 71, and 134 g/mL, respectively) [14, 15] . Previous studies showed that 80 -400 mg/kg ribavirin daily reduces the mortality in rats with encephalitis induced by Junin virus [11] , in rhesus monkeys with encephalitis induced by Rift Valley fever virus [12] , and in mice with myocarditis induced by coxsackievirus B3 [6] . On the basis of these studies, 100 mg/kg ribavirin was chosen to treat EV71-infected mice, and this dose showed a protective effect. In our study, ribavirin was given to infected mice during the viremic phase (data not shown). Further studies are needed to test the efficacy of ribavirin therapy beginning later in the disease course in mice. For Nipah virus, despite the IC 50 of ribavirin being higher than that for EV71 and the fact that the drug fails to prevent the deaths of infected hamsters [14] , ribavirin treatment significantly reduces mortality in patients with encephalitis without inducing the adverse effects (such as anemia, jaundice, and teratogenic effects) commonly associated with a 6 -9-day regimen of oral ribavirin, starting with a loading dose of 2000 mg daily, or with a 7-day regimen of intravenous ribavirin, starting with a loading dose of 94 mg/kg daily [10] . Under these regimens, the plasma concentration of ribavirin is \u03f32.5 g/mL, which is comparable to that found in HCV-infected patients treated with the drug [7] . The concentration of ribavirin in cerebrospinal fluid is \u03f370% of that in plasma in humans [16] . Interestingly, the IC 50 of ribavirin for Nipah virus is \u03fe40 times higher than the clinically achievable concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. For HCV, the IC 50 of ribavirin is 230 mol/L (56 g/mL), \u03fe22 times higher than the plasma concentration [17] . In fact, the IC 50 of ribavirin for almost all viruses for which the drug shows therapeutic efficacy in patients-including measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, La Crosse virus, hantavirus virus, and Lassa virus [5, 8, 9, 18 -21] -are much higher than the plasma concentrations. Evidently, ribavirin inhibits viruses more efficiently in vivo than in vitro.",

In addition, the dose of ribavirin that effectively protects mice from EV71 infection is close to the initial dose of the drug used intravenously to improve the conditions of patients with encephalitis induced by Nipah virus [10] . Collectively, these data demonstrate that ribavirin could be a potential anti-EV71 drug. Our previous study showed that type I interferons also reduce mortality in EV71infected mice [22] . Alternatively, the combination of ribavirin and interferon, which has a synergistic effect and is used as a standard therapy for HCV-infected patients, could be considered for the treatment of potentially fatal EV71 infection.",
