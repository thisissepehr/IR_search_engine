Granulocytes in the tissue undergo apoptosis during the resolution of inflammation to prevent bystander tissue injury occurring from the release of potentially toxic cellular contents 8 . Removal of apoptotic neutrophils prompts a switch from a pro-to an anti-inflammatory macrophage pheno type, which is a prerequisite for macrophage efferocytosis and egress via the lymphatic vessels 9 .
