Mortality rate (0.03%) for hospitalized patients, with confi rmed Infl uenza A H1N1 infection is comparable to data available from WHO and does not change with H1N1 negative patients [4] . Since patients admitted directly to ICU are not included in the study, the overall mortality rate is probably underestimated, as other sources state that mortality rate of patients in ICU is signifi cantly higher (14-36%) [4] . Th is mortality rate is in accordance with mortality rate of H1N1 patients transferred from normal ward to ICU. NS-non-significant. Most (66.7%) H1N1 positive patients were admitted between week 47 and 51; this is slightly later than the peak of confi rmed cases in Slovenia and other countries of EURO region of WHO [9] .
