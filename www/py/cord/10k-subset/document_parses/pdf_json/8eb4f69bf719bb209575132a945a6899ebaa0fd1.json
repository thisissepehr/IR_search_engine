We conducted a regional retrospective study in the ATL endemic area of Okinawa, Japan. Of 62 ATL patients, 21 received allo-HSCT in CR and 41 in non-CR. The 3-year overall survival (3yOS) rate and median survival time for the whole cohort was 25.6% and 7.7 months, respectively. The 3yOS of Pt-non-CR was significantly lower than that of patients in CR (Pt-CR) (16.8% vs. 43.6%, P = 0.005). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher in Pt-non-CR than in Pt-CR (46.3% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.025), while there was no significant difference in disease-associated mortality (DAM) between Ptnon-CR and Pt-CR. Multivariable analysis for Pt-non-CR revealed that poor performance status (poor-PS) and higher sIL-2R level (high sIL-2R) adversely affected OS. Poor-PS was associated with higher TRM, but not with higher DAM in Pt-non-CR. High sIL-2R did not affect TRM or DAM in Pt-non-CR.

In that study, non-CR at transplantation was also identified as a risk factor for diseaseassociated mortality (DAM). Although disease status at transplantation is known to be an important factor associated with outcome after allo-HSCT for ATL, it is often difficult to achieve CR in ATL patients. As a consequence, some ATL patients are compelled to receive allo-HSCT despite their non-CR status.

Patients with aggressive ATL who do not receive allo-HSCT in Okinawa Prefecture show poorer clinical outcomes than those patients in other areas of Japan [30] . The difference in clinical outcomes between patients with ATL in Okinawa and those in other areas of Japan might be partly attributed to the different distribution of the HTLV-1 tax genotype in Okinawa from mainland of Japan [31] . Further study is needed to clarify the impact of geographical factors and/or genetic backgrounds of ATL patients on transplantation outcomes after allo-HSCT in Okinawa.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 148, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 395, "end": 399, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 627, "end": 631, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Since this study was an observational retrospective study and included a small patient population, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about factors affecting the outcomes of allo-HSCT in all ATL patients. However, our study included all patients with aggressive ATL who received allo-HSCT in Okinawa Prefecture during the study period. Therefore, the results of our study reflected actual conditions of allo-HSCT for ATL in Okinawa. Because patients received transplantation without strict transplant eligibility criteria, patients with poor ECOG-PS were included in this study. Indeed, there was one patient with an ECOG-PS of three in Pt-CR and four patients with an ECOG-PS of three in Pt-non-CR. No patients had ECOG-PS 4 in either group. Even after excluding patients with ECOG-PS of three, similar results were seen in these patients ( Fig. S5 and Table S4 ). In this study, 41 Pt-non-CR included 20 patients with partial response, 6 patients with stable disease, and 15 patients with progressive disease at transplantation (Table 1) .

However, it is difficult to complete planned treatments because of toxicity and/or loss of effectiveness of the chemotherapy [8] . In cases of dismal outcomes after intensive chemotherapy in ATL patients, hematologists often consider allo-HSCT as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL in non-CR. Indeed, in the current study, and in other retrospective studies of allo-HSCT for aggressive ATL, the number of Ptnon-CR tends to be more than double that of Pt-CR [15, 27] . Since the early application of allo-HSCT is considered to reduce TRM and improve overall survival in patients with aggressive ATL, we should consider both the disease status at transplantation and the optimal timing of allo-HSCT.

Our findings suggest that not only treatment for disease control but also intensive management to prevent transplant-related complications is required in order to improve the success rate of transplantation in ATL patients who cannot achieve CR before allo-HSCT.

One-year overall survival rates in patients with ECOG-PS 0-1 and those with ECOG-PS 2-4 were 42.9% (95% CI: 24.6-60.0%) and 7.7% (95% CI: 0.5-29.2%), respectively (P < 0.001). Solid and dashed lines indicate survival curves for the patients with ECOG-PS 0-1 and ECOG-PS 2-4, respectively. b Kaplan-Meier curve for non-CR patients according to sIL-2R level (sIL-2R < 2000 U/mL vs. sIL-2R \u2265 2000 U/mL) at transplantation. One-year overall survival rates in the patients with sIL-2R < 2000 U/mL and those with sIL-2R \u2265 2000 U/mL were 50.0% (95% CI: 25.9-70.1%) and 21.1% (95% CI: 6.6-41.0%), respectively (P = 0.020). Solid and dashed lines indicate survival curves for patients with sIL-2R < 2000 U/mL and sIL-2R \u2265 2000 U/mL, respectively.
