We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on 123 NHL patients who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy between 2009 and 2016 in order to describe the incidence, etiologies and effect on survival of respiratory complications defined by new or worsening respiratory symptoms requiring diagnostic work-up or hospitalization. Thirty patients (24%) developed respiratory complications during a follow-up time of 825 (555-1338) days after chemotherapy. They had a higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and lung or pleural involvement at diagnosis as compared to patients who did not develop complications. Overall, 58 episodes of pulmonary complications were observed after median (interquartile) times from the first and last rituximab doses of 205 (75-580) days and 27 (14-163) days respectively. Infectious etiologies accounted for 75% of the respiratory complications, followed by heart failure exacerbation, lymphomatous involvement, and ARDS. Two Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonias were observed, and no complication was ascribed to rituximab toxicity. Respiratory complications required ICU admission in 19 cases (33%) and invasive mechanical ventilation in 14 cases (24%). Using a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, we observed that the occurrence of respiratory complications was associated with a 170% increase in death hazard (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.60-4.40, p = 0.001).

Clinical trials have reported that pulmonary complications are frequently observed in NHL patients receiving chemotherapy [2] [3] [4] ; for instance, about 40% of elderly patients treated with R-CHOP regimen experience pulmonary complications which can be severe in 10% of patients [2] . In lymphoma patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplant, respiratory complications were found to be a major source of morbidity and mortality (33 and 65% mortality rates for infectious and non-infectious complications respectively) [5] . However, similar information in patients outside of the bone marrow transplant setting is lacking, as respiratory complications described in clinical trials were only reported as adverse events and were not specifically investigated. Yet, in NHL patients, acute respiratory failure is a leading cause for ICU admission [6] , which is associated with decreased survival [7] . Respiratory complications may result from infections developing after chemotherapy, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonias.

For patients developing respiratory complications, overall survival after the first complication was plotted using a Kaplan-Meier curve. To analyze the impact of respiratory complications on mortality, we used Cox models with time-dependent covariates as recommended by Therneau et al.

For this, a time-dependent predictor was created, which denoted, at any time t, the number of respiratory complications that occurred before time t for any subject. This predictor was always zero if the subject had no respiratory complications. If the subject had one respiratory complication at day d, this predictor was then zero for t < d and one for t > =d. A standard Cox proportional hazards model was then fitted on this time-dependent predictor and on other static covariates selected based on univariate analysis (age, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), NHL stage, and lung/pleural involvement at diagnosis).

This incidence is higher than reported in clinical trials [27] , one reason might be a longer follow-up in our study. This result, however, is consistent with the study by Coiffier et al. which reported that 65% of 202 NHL patient developed infections within 2 years follow-up after receiving R-CHOP, 12% being graded as severe (sources of infections were not reported though and may have included non-respiratory infections). Seymour et al. reported 4% of pneumonias classified as serious adverse events among 386 patients receiving R-CHOP for diffuse large B cell lymphoma [27] . Most of the infections that we observed were bacterial pneumonias, but viral infections or co-infections were also very frequent, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonias developed in 2 patients. The spectrum of infectious complications was somewhat different than reported after autologous bone marrow transplant, as Aspergillus, CMV, and Herpes simplex virus infections were common in the study by Jules-Elysee [5] and not observed in our population. An association between rituximab administration and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia has been suggested in two retrospective cohort studies [19, 20] , and another series reported an incidence as high as 13% in NHL patients receiving rituximab [24] . We observed a much lower incidence of less than 2%; however, clinicians should certainly consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia when evaluating a patient developing respiratory complications after chemotherapy for NHL. Although numerous case reports or small series of rituximab-induced interstitial lung disease have been published [10, 14] , none of the complication observed in our relatively small series of patients was ascribed to rituximab. We were particularly careful in our evaluation for potential rituximab toxicity, only including patients with pre-and post-chemotherapy chest CT scans available; this suggests that rituximab lung toxicity remains a rare event, as recently shown in a retrospective cohort study of 560 patients, where the authors reported that computed tomographic abnormalities were frequent in NHL patients regardless of rituximab administration, and that rituximab only marginally increased the risk of developing interstitial pneumonitis (3.9% versus 1.3%, p = 0.07) [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 220, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 330, "end": 351, "text": "Coiffier et al. which", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1153, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1334, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1338, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1437, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1780, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1784, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2444, "end": 2447, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "None of the complications reported here was related to acute pulmonary embolism, which is likely due to the small population included; even though a higher incidence of thromboembolic events has been described in patients with lymphoma, these events were mainly deep vein thromboses and only 2% of patients developed acute pulmonary embolism in a large cohort study [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition to lung or pleural involvement at diagnosis, our study suggests that pre-existing CHF may be a risk factor for developing respiratory complications, even from non-cardiac origin, after chemotherapy, and that CHF exacerbations account for a significant part of respiratory complications.
