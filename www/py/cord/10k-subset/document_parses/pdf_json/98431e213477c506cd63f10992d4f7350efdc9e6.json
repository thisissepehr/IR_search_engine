In the current study, we investigated the presence and cellular distribution of Ang-(1-7) and the Mas receptor, the expression of Mas and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) messenger RNA (mRNA), and the enzymatic activity in the rat ovary following gonadotropin stimulation in vivo. Immature female Wistar rats (25 days old) were injected subcutaneously (SC) with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 20 IU in 0.2 mL) or vehicle 48 hours before euthanasia. Tissue distributions of Ang-(1-7), Mas receptor, and ACE2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, along with angiotensin II (Ang II) localization, while the mRNA expression levels of Mas receptor and ACE2 were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we determined the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP), prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), and ACE by fluorometric assays. After eCG treatment, we found strong immunoreactivity for Ang-(1-7) and Mas primarily in the theca-interstitial cells, while Ang II appeared in the granulosa but not in the thecal layer. Equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment increased Mas and ACE2 mRNA expression compared with control animals (3.3-and 2.1-fold increase, respectively; P < .05). Angiotensin-converting enzyme and NEP activities were lower, while PEP activity was higher in the eCG-treated rats (P < .05). These data show gonadotropin-induced changes in the ovarian expression of Ang-(1-7), Mas receptor, and ACE2. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) branch formed by ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas, fully expressed in the rat ovary and regulated by gonadotropic hormones, could play a role in the ovarian physiology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Folliculogenesis is a continuous process that comprises the growth, development, and differentiation of ovarian follicles until they ovulate or undergo atresia. In addition to the well-established control by gonadotropins and gonadal steroids, an intraovarian regulation of folliculogenesis has been described, in which several peptides and growth factors regulate ovarian functions. 1, 2 Many studies point to an involvement of the ovarian renin-angiotensin system (RAS) as a paracrine/autocrine regulator of follicular development, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and atresia. Prorenin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II), and Ang II receptors have been identified in the ovary, as reviewed by Yoshimura. 3 In spite of these studies, data regarding the role of Ang II in ovarian physiology are very discrepant. Studies related to ovulation showed that saralasin, a nonspecific antagonist for Ang II type 1 (AT 1 ) and Ang II type 2 (AT 2 ) receptors, blocked gonadotropin-induced ovulation in rats 4 and rabbits. 5 Kuji et al 6 demonstrated inhibition of ovulation in rabbits by PD123319, a specific AT 2 blocker, an effect not produced by CV11974, a specific AT 1 blocker. In contrast, captopril, an ACE inhibitor, does not affect ovulation in rats 7 or rabbits. 8 Other studies of RAS and steroidogenesis in ovaries revealed a stimulatory effect of Ang II on estradiol, 9, 10 androstenedione, 11 and testosterone production. 12 However, captopril does not have any effect on estradiol and progesterone secretion in rats, 13, 14 suggesting the possibility of other RAS peptides involvement in these actions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 386, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 387, "end": 388, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 765, "end": 766, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1059, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1074, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1325, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1434, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1437, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1457, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1489, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1586, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1589, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Angiotensin-(1-7) ] is a biologically active member of the RAS, formed by an ACE-independent pathway, that may have similar or opposite actions to Ang II. 15 It can be generated from Ang I by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), or from Ang II by PEP. 16 In addition, it can be inactivated by aminopeptidases (AMPs) or by ACE, generating smaller fragments. 17, 18 Recently, an Ang-(1-7)-forming enzyme homologous to ACE was discovered and named ACE2.

However, whether Ang-(1-7) is released and binds to the Mas receptor located in the theca and interstitial cells remains to be determined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 846, "end": 849, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 850, "end": 852, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The discrepant findings about the role of Ang II in the ovary 4,7 contribute to our idea that some roles attributed to Ang II could actually be played by Ang- (1-7) . In this study, we demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) and its forming enzyme ACE2 are present in the rat ovary. A cautious perfusion of the ovaries was done to exclude the possibility of contamination by peptides from circulation and strengthens the evidence that these peptides are locally produced. It should be noted that granulosa cells of antral and preovulatory follicles were negative for Ang- (1-7) . Using a different model, Pepperell et al 42 have shown the presence of Ang-(1-7) in luteal cells, but no effect on progesterone production was observed on exogenous administration of Ang-(1-7). In the current work, we have used immature eCG-treated rats with no corpora lutea. Follicular granulosa cells were rich in Ang II, similarly to that observed by Palumbo et al 43 in granulosa cells of antral and preovulatory follicles of gonadotropin-stimulated human ovaries. However, a recent study showed strong immunoreactivity for Ang II in mid-luteal corpora lutea from unstimulated human ovary, whereas occasional weak staining was observed in follicles of every stage. 37 This suggests an integrated local RAS species-specific system involving different sources, targets, and ovarian status for each active peptide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 609, "end": 611, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1240, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 164, "text": "(1-7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 560, "end": 565, "text": "(1-7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Several RAS components have been described in the ovary, including renin, 44 angiotensinogen, 45 ACE, 46 AT 1 , and AT 2 receptors. 13 The presence of Ang-(1-7), Mas receptor, and ACE2 completes the panel of RAS members in the ovary and leads to the natural question of how this system works. Figure 4 shows an upto-date scheme of the possible formation and degradation of the main components of the RAS in the ovary. On the basis of the current findings, showing that Ang-(1-7) and Mas are located in the theca-interstitial cells, while Ang II predominates in the granulosa cells; and considering previous evidence that both peptides are able to stimulate ovarian steroidogenesis, 12, 20 it is plausible that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas complex could modulate androgen production in the theca-interstitial compartment, while Ang II promotes the conversion of androgen to estradiol in granulosa cells. We have previously shown that Ang-(1-7) and Ang II had similar effects on estradiol and progesterone production, indicating that some effects attributed to Ang II could be due to its conversion to Ang-(1-7). 20 The Ang-(1-7) antagonist A-779 blocked the progesterone production induced by Ang II but had no effect on the estradiol production, indicating that Ang II and Ang-(1-7) could play complementary roles on steroidogenesis. Even though we had not analyzed the effect of Ang-(1-7) on the ovulatory process in the current study, we could suppose that the failure of several laboratories to obtain complete control of ovulation, while blocking with saralasin could be accounted for the effect of locally produced Ang-(1-7).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 76, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 102, "end": 104, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 132, "end": 134, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1102, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 301, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the rat ovary expresses the active peptide Ang-(1-7) and its receptor Mas, which are located mainly in the theca cells of antral follicles and in the ovarian stroma.
