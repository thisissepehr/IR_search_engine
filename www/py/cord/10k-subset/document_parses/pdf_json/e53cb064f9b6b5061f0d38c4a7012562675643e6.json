However, the importance of airborne transmission in the spread of influenza is unclear, in part because of a lack of information about the infectivity of the airborne virus. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of viable influenza A virus that was expelled by patients in aerosol particles while coughing. Sixty-four symptomatic adult volunteer outpatients were asked to cough 6 times into a cough aerosol collection system. Seventeen of these participants tested positive for influenza A virus by viral plaque assay (VPA) with confirmation by viral replication assay (VRA). Viable influenza A virus was detected in the cough aerosol particles from 7 of these 17 test subjects (41%). Viable influenza A virus was found in the smallest particle size fraction (0.3 \u00b5m to 8 \u00b5m), with a mean of 142 plaque-forming units (SD 215) expelled during the 6 coughs in particles of this size. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A release small airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment. Although the amounts of influenza A detected in cough aerosol particles during our experiments were relatively low, larger quantities could be expelled by influenza patients during a pandemic when illnesses would be more severe. Our findings support the idea that airborne infectious particles could play an important role in the spread of influenza.",

            "text": "I nfluenza is of great concern to the occupational health community because of the annual burden of seasonal outbreaks and the potential for newly emerging strains to cause a severe global pandemic. During a pandemic, health care workers would be at tremendous risk for exposure to the virus as they care for a surge of infected patients. To implement effective infection control measures in health care facilities, the pathways by which the disease spreads from person to person need to be identified so that transmission can be interrupted. Although influenza is known to infect people through contact with respiratory secretions containing the virus, it is possible to transfer this infectious material between people in many different ways, and the importance of different routes of infection is not yet known. (1) One possible mode of influenza transmission that is of particular concern is infection by the inhalation of airborne particles that are produced by infected patients as they cough, sneeze, speak, and breathe. If influenza is disseminated to a significant degree by airborne transmission, this would suggest that interventions in health care facilities such as improved ventilation and filtration, air disinfection, patient isolation and cohorting, and the use of respirators or other personal protective equipment might be required to reduce its spread, especially during a pandemic. However, the role of aerosol particles in the dispersion of influenza has not been clearly determined. Some investigators have concluded that transmission by airborne particles accounts for a significant fraction of influenza cases, (2) (3) (4) while others believe that it rarely, if ever, occurs. (5) The likelihood of someone becoming infected with influenza by inhaling virus-laden aerosol particles depends in part upon the amount of aerosolized virus to which the person is exposed and the size of the particles carrying the virus. (6) Several studies have shown that airborne influenza viral RNA can be detected in a variety of health care facilities. (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) Airborne particles containing influenza RNA were found up to 1.8 m from hospitalized patients with influenza (10) in one study, and up to 3.7 m away from patients at home in another study. (11) Two studies measured airborne influenza in a hospital emergency department and an urgent care outpatient clinic, and determined that about half of the influenza viral RNA was contained in airborne particles less than 4 \u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter. (12, 13) Aerosol particles in this size range (called the respirable size fraction) are of particular concern because they can remain airborne for an extended time and are easily inhaled, and because they can reach the deepest regions of the lungs.",

(14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) Multiple respiratory viruses, including influenza, were found in particles \u22645 \u00b5m that were collected during breathing (80% of samples) and coughing (82%) from 12 adults and 41 children with symptomatic respiratory infections. (18) In another study, influenza patients were found to exhale about 19 viral copies/minute in particles <5 \u00b5m. (17) During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, influenza virus RNA was detected in the cough aerosol particles from 81% of influenza patients in an outpatient clinic, and 65% of the influenza RNA was found in respirable particles. (16) Although these studies have demonstrated that patients do expel influenza virus in airborne particles, a frequent criticism has been that the potential for the virus in the aerosols to infect someone is unknown, because PCR-based methods cannot distinguish between viable and non-viable virus. Only four studies have reported detecting viable influenza virus in airborne particles, and these results were limited. Lindsley et al. (16) were able to culture influenza virus from aerosol samples collected from 2 out of 20 influenza patients during voluntary coughs. Similarly, Milton et al. (17) detected viable influenza in the fine particle fraction (<5 \u00b5m) from 2 of their 37 patients. Lednicky and Loeb (11) detected viable airborne influenza virus in particles from 1 \u00b5m to <0.25 \u00b5m up to 3.7 m from their patients. Hatagishi et al. (19) detected viable influenza in droplets and aerosol particles collected on dry gelatin filters from 3 of 56 influenza patients. These studies demonstrate that at least some influenza patients do eject aerosol particles containing viable influenza virus into the environment, but because of the limited sample numbers, many questions remain. It is not clear what fraction of influenza patients release infectious virus in aerosols, how much infectious virus is released, or how much this varies depending upon the stage or severity of the illness or the strain of the virus.",

The largest amount of viable influenza A was detected in the media of the aerosol sampler, which collects the smallest particles (0.3 to 8 \u00b5m). These results are consistent with previous studies. (11, 16, 17) Since the collection efficiencies of the sampler elbow and droplet tray have not been measured, it is not clear if the differences in the amount of virus detected occurred because no viable virus was present in the larger particles, virus collected on the dry surfaces of the elbow and tray but then lost its viability, or if these particles were not collected. However, the fact that viable influenza A was detected in the smallest particles is quite important, because the smallest aerosol particles are also the ones that remain airborne the longest (an 8 \u00b5m particle takes about 13 min to fall 1.5 m in still air, and the settling time rapidly increases as particle size decreases). (26) Small particles also are easiest to inhale, and can deposit most deeply in the respiratory tract. Thus, airborne influenza A virus was detected in the small particles that are most likely to cause airborne transmission.",

            "text": "The amount of viable influenza A virus detected in the small airborne cough particles was relatively low, with a mean of 142 PFU in six coughs. However, the dose of influenza required for inoculation by the aerosol route is also quite low; one study found that inhalation of an aerosol containing approximately 0.7-3.5 PFU of influenza was sufficient to cause seroconversion in 50% of the human subjects tested. (27) In contrast, the infectious dose by intranasal inoculation in two other studies was 89-224 PFU, which is considerably higher. (28, 29) Aerosol inoculation also is reported to result in more severe symptoms, presumably because aerosol particles are able to deposit deeper in the respiratory tract than droplets administered by intranasal inoculation. (30) The amount of influenza A virus detected in cough aerosols in this study was probably much lower than would be seen in a severe influenza pandemic. First, studies of nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with naturally occurring influenza infections have shown that influenza viral shedding typically peaks on or around the first day of acute respiratory illness. (31) (32) (33) Patients in our study typically presented at the clinic the day after their symptoms developed, which was after the expected peak in nasopharyngeal viral shedding. The amount of influenza A virus in nasopharyngeal swabs is only weakly correlated with the amount in cough aerosols, but both are reported to decline rapidly over time. (17, 19) In addition, the test subjects recruited for this study were young, otherwise healthy ambulatory outpatients. Patients who are more severely ill cough more and have higher viral loads, which would likely increase the amount of virus in the cough-generated aerosols. (34) This would be especially important during a pandemic, when much larger numbers of severely ill patients would be expected. Finally, our informal observations indicated that the sickest and most symptomatic patients were least likely to volunteer for the study. All of these limitations suggest that the amount of airborne influenza virus that would be expelled by patients during a pandemic would be significantly higher than was observed here.",

More studies with larger numbers of patients and with a broader range of medical conditions will be needed to fully understand the amount of viable airborne virus that is projected into the environment by patients. Second, our experiments focused on viable virus released during coughing. However, this does not mean that infectious virus is not released during other respiratory maneuvers such as breathing and speaking. Third, we asked the study participants to inhale deeply and cough using as much of the air in their lungs as possible. This produced a deeper and more forceful cough than would be seen during natural coughs, which may have increased aerosol production. Lastly, although our results show that patients with influenza A expel small airborne particles carrying viable influenza A virus into the environment, they do not show that transmission actually occurs by the airborne route, nor do they indicate what the relative risk is that the virus could be spread by the airborne pathway compared to other means. More work will be needed to determine the likelihood of airborne transmission in real-world environments and the necessity of interventions to prevent it.",

The cough then flowed through a valve and into the piston spirometer, displacing the piston to the right. The droplet tray collected any large drops that impacted it. When the subject finished coughing, the valve was closed and the SKC BioSampler was turned on. The cough aerosol was pulled out of the spirometer and collected by the aerosol sampler. Airborne droplets larger than about 10-15 \u00b5m collected in the sampler elbow, while smaller particles were collected in the sampler collection media.
