Adenoma of the pars distalis of the pituitary gland was perhaps the only notable neoplasm. This low incidence of neoplasms for this strain can be viewed favorably in comparison to that observed in the widely used Fischer 344 rat, which shows a high incidence of pituitary adenomas (Coleman et al., 1977; Maeda et al., 1985) and mononuclear cell leukemia (Coleman et al., 1977; Losco and Ward, 1984) . However the relatively low median life span observed in the GRC of Wistar rats colony may have prevented a greater incidence of neoplasms. Among the longer-lived Lobund-Wistar strain, tumors do not usually appear until about 18 months, with most not found until 30 months of age. However, among the outbred Sprague-Dawley strain, which tends toward great body size and adiposity compared to other strains, a high incidence of tumors is notable at ages more in line with the shorter life spans observed in GRC Wistar rats (Ross and Bras, 1971) . Tumor incidence was again very responsive to diet manipulation in this strain. Instead, several other major pathologies could be used to characterize GRC Wistar rats raised under the environmental conditions imposed. Among them would be chronic cardiomyopathy. Hyperplasia was notable in several sites and organs, including bile duct, parathyroids, and adrenal medulla. It remains to be determined if the hyperplasia represents a disease or a normal aging process similar to the thymic atrophy observed. Other sites more suspicious for disease processes would include the chronic inflammation of the preputial gland, and lymphoid infiltration and granulomatous inflammation of the lungs. These conditions could perhaps be altered by changes made in the pathogen environment, such as the impact of PVM on lung function. Major pathology to sensory organs was restricted to the eyes, where cataracts and histiocytic infiltration of the ciliary body were noted and to the areas where axonal degeneration of the cauda equina was observed. Light exposure as well as other possible environmental factors might be responsible for the incidence of cataracts.
