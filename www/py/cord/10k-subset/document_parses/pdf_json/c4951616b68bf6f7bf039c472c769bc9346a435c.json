HCWs in this study could, therefore, be divided according to their vaccination status of seasonal vaccinations for 4 years (repeated) and <4 years (occasional). Despite over half a century of seasonal influenza vaccination use, the long-term impact of annual vaccinations on antibody responses remains unclear. We found that H1N1pdm09-specific HI antibodies were boosted after each IIV, and the seroprotective titers were maintained over 12 months post-IIV in both the repeated and the occasional groups. The lack of significant differences in HI antibodies between these 2 groups suggests that repeated vaccination with the same H1N1pdm09 virus was not better than occasional vaccination. However, other immunological parameters, such as the quality of antibodies or memory B-and T-cells, which were not accessed here, have been shown to be improved after repeated vaccination [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Others have found that repeated vaccination did not lower protection [17, 18] and was beneficial at reducing viral shedding and infection, similarly to first-time vaccinees [19] . Furthermore, as the A/ H3N2 and B strains, which are also included in the seasonal vaccine, undergo more frequent antigenic drift, it is important to have immunity against these more-frequently changing viruses. Therefore, we support the continuation of annual seasonal vaccination, even with the same vaccine antigen, to provide better protection in HCWs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 965, "end": 969, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 985, "end": 989, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1065, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1069, "text": "18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "HCWs are at a significantly higher risk of influenza exposure and infection compared to adults working in other sectors [20] . We found that 21% of HCWs had detectable antibodies to H1N1pdm09 prior to pandemic vaccination, suggesting considerable exposure or asymptomatic subclinical infection. Indeed, as previously reported [6] , compared to other departments in the hospital, working on the infectious disease wards, where infected patients were treated, was a risk factor for detectable preexisting H1N1pdm09 antibodies. These findings show the risk of influenza infection in HCWs who choose not to be vaccinated and who may, therefore, pose a risk of influenza transmission to patients and other HCWs. Furthermore, higher pre-pandemic vaccination H1N1pdm09-specific antibodies were observed in HCWs who had previous seasonal vaccinations compared to those never before vaccinated. In meta-analyses, pre-2009 IIV provided moderate cross-protection before the pandemic vaccine was available [21] . Our data show that HCWs who had a previous habit of seasonal vaccinations were more likely to continue to choose vaccination. Worryingly, only 33/250 (13%, including 6 LRs) of HCWs were annually vaccinated over the 5 years of this study. There is an urgent need to improve vaccination uptake, particularly in frontline HCWs, and this requires effective strategies to initiate a habit of annual vaccination in HCWs. In the future, the next generation of influenza vaccines should provide robust antibodies and long-lasting protection, while not causing prolonged AEs to overcome the requirement of annual vaccination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 124, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 326, "end": 329, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 994, "end": 998, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "HCWs are an important target group for influenza vaccination, as well as for well-kept records of influenza vaccination and self-reported influenza-like illnesses.
