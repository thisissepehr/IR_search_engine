It is characterized by the uncontrolled activation and proliferation of T cells and excessive activation of macrophages, resulting in persistent high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe cytopenia, serious liver disease, intravascular coagulation, and neurological involvement. SoJIA constitutes about 10%-20% of all cases of JIA. However, more than two thirds of deaths in JIA patients are due to SoJIA. MAS, also a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with SoJIA. [1] Two recent research reports give a mortality of 8%-22%. [2, 3] Hence, earlier diagnosis and treatment of MAS are important to decrease the mortality of children with SoJIA.",

            "text": "The term MAS has been used almost exclusively to describe this condition in association with rheumatic diseases. It is most commonly seen with systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and is also associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis, and Kawasaki disease. In 1985, Hadchouel et al [5] described 7 patients with systemic onset of JRA who developed this complication during the course of their disease. In 1993, the term MAS was used to defi ne this clinical manifestation, and since then, MAS has been widely used in rheumatic diseases, especially in SoJIA. [6] In our study, all patients were diagnosed as having SoJIA complicated by MAS. Clinicians have suggested MAS is HLH related rheumatic diseases. Although MAS bears clinical and biological similarities to other rheumatic diseases mentioned above, it is unique in three distinct ways. [2] First, MAS appears to occur with varying degrees of severity, ranging from the moribund child with persistent high grade fever, signifi cant hepatosplenomegaly, icterus, and laboratory parameters showing pancytopenia, coagulopathy, hepatic, and renal disorders to the unwell child with persistent fever, no signifi cant organomegaly, a relative drop in blood cell counting, and mild if any coagulopathy. The biology behind these varied changes is poorly understood. Second, MAS occurs in systemic rheumatic diseases, primarily SoJIA, which is an infl ammatory disorder with hematological abnormalities refl ecting this. Thus, anemia, leucocytosis, and thrombocytosis with a raised ESR and C reactive protein are typical indexes of active disease. A signifi cant drop in these laboratory parameters, even though technically not in the range of thrombocytopenia or leucopenia, cannot be dismissed as irrelevants. It may well represent the onset of MAS in the correct clinical setting, as was seen in our patients. A \"relative\" change in counts may in fact be a key to early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. Third, early and aggressive immunosuppression is likely to benefi t these patients, unlike in familial HLH where bone marrow transplantation is the cure.",

We therefore emphasized that HLH should not be excluded for some clinical features not meeting the HLH criteria, and that repeated examinations were necessary in some suspicious patients. Otherwise, some patients in the early stage would be excluded. Hemophagocytosis is an important index in the diagnosis of MAS.

Serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are not included in the 1991 HLH criteria, but more attention should be paid to their laboratory examinations. In a study of secondary HLH, hyperferritinemia (ferritin >1000 g/ L) was found in 90% and elevated LDH (LDH >1000 iu/L) in 89.7% of patients whereas hyperglycemia and hypofi brinogenesis in 50% and 57.4%, respectively. [7] Despite their poor specifi cities, serum ferritin and LDH are sensitive indexes for the diagnosis of HLH. In our study, cases of hyperferritinemia and cases of elevated LDH accounted for 55.5% and 88.9% respectively. Hence, the new 2004 criteria set forth by the International Histocyte Institute included 3 new indexes: decreased or lack of natural killer (NK) cell activities, hyperferritinemia, and evaluated soluble CD25 (>2400 U/ml). [8] In China, however, the 1991 HLH criteria are still widely used. The detection of NK cell activity can help to differentiate primary from secondary HLH. In the primary HLH, the decrease of NK cell activity is prolonged. But in the secondary HLH, the abnormal condition will disappear soon after the recovery of the patient. [9] [10] [11] Triggers of MAS can be divided into two types: infection factor and pharmaceutical factor. [12] Infection factors include bacteria, virus, parasite and fungi. Pharmaceutical factors include non-steroid antiinfl ammatory agents (e.g., aspirin), anti-epileptic drugs, gold preparation sulfasalazine, MTX, parenteral nutrition, TNF-antagon, and CD52 antagon. In our study, viral infection occurred in 3 patients. Drugs as triggers were not found in our study. Recent studies have indicated that the mechanism of MAS might be related to cytokines caused by the abnormal expression of the perforin gene and functional disorder of NK cells. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Abnormal function of cytotoxic lytic activities of NK cells of SoJRA with MAS was reported to be associated with decreased perforin expression and the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Abnormal cytotoxic cells might fail to provide appropriate apoptotic signals for the removal of activated macrophages after infection is cleared. These immunologic abnormalities are due to mutations in the gene encoding perforin, a protein that mediates the cytotoxic activity of NK. [19] A91V is the most common amino-acid substitution identifi ed in perforin, with an allele frequency ranging between 3% and 17% in the general population. [20] But in our study, the perforin A91V (NCBI:SNP rs35947132) gene in 6 SoJIA patients with MAS were normal. MAS has been reported to respond to corticosteroids alone or in appropriate supportive management. In a recent case series, remission was induced in 15 of the 21 episodes of MAS by steroids alone. Patients with a suboptimal response to corticosteroids have been well with the addition of cyclosporin A. [7] Only a few reports focused on patients with MAS who were treated with other agents including etoposide. Plasmapheresis was also effective in some cases. [21] Mouy et al [22] described that 5 cases (4 SoJIA and 1 polyarthritis type JIA) responded to cyclosporin A effectively. Kounami et al [23] held that cyclosporin A may be the choice of fi rst-line treatment. In our study, administration of corticosteroids along with VCR and/or VP16 worked effectively. In an episode, the child did not respond to the therapy with dexamethasone plus cyclosporin A and gammaglobulin, but after the combined administration with VP16, the patient recovered rapidly. In another patient, ARDS, MODS and pneumonorrhagia occurred during the episode, and plasmapheresis together with pharmaceutical treatment helped the patient to pull through. Thus the agents for the treatment of patients consist of corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, plasmapheresis, and gammaglobulin. Once MAS occurs, the patients' condition will deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment of MAS are essentially important to a better outcome.",
