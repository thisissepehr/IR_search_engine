More than 11 million children under the age of five die every year and an overwhelming majority of these cases arise from preventable or easily treatable conditions [2] . In fact, over 70% of global child deaths can be attributed to diarrhea, malaria, neonatal infection, pneumonia, preterm delivery, or lack of oxygen at birth. [3] Most child deaths occur in developing countries, which play host to contributing factors such as marginalization, conflict, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, and lack of safe drinking water and sanitation. Children in the developing world are ten times more likely to die before age five as compared to their counterparts in developed countries [2] . In fact, in the ten countries with the highest child mortality rates, almost 1 of every 5 children dies before age five [2] .",

About 20% of the disease burden in children under age 5 is tied to poor maternal health and nutrition, as well as the quality of care children receive in the first year of life [3] . Every year, 8 million babies die before or during delivery and during the newborn period, while others left motherless have a 10-fold risk of dying within 2 years of their mothers' death. Maternal mortality is also at a critical level as nearly 550,000 women die each year from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, including hemorrhage, infection, obstructed labor, hypertensive disorders, and unsafe abortion practices [4] . The vast majority of these maternal deaths occur in the developing world. Sadly, they are also due to preventable causes including pregnancy and childbirth at an early age, closely spaced births, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and complications during child birth [5] . When it comes to the indicator of mortality risk, women in developing countries experience the largest disparity of any health indicator when contrasted to women in richer, developed countries. Compared to a 1 in 4,000 risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth in the developed world, a woman in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, faces a 1 in 16 chance of death [3] .",

As these problems continue to escalate naturally, strategic, cost-efficient programs are necessary to curb them and to improve the state of global child and maternal health. In fact, research demonstrates that with the use of cost-effective, evidence-based healthcare interventions, 6 million child deaths can be prevented [3] . Examples include immunization programs, antibiotics, insecticidetreated bed net distribution, micronutrient supplementation, and improved family care and breastfeeding practices [3] . In order to design, implement, and evaluate such programs that purport to decrease the under-5 mortality rate and achieve improvements in overall health in the developing world, public policy is needed. Legislating international strategy will mobilize stakeholders and appropriate funding in order to implement effective programs for sustainable change. This is precisely the task of Senate Bill 1966 (S. 1966) which seeks to improve the health of infants, children, and mothers in the world's poorest nations [6] .",

            "text": "While U.S. health policy pertaining specifically to global child and maternal health is a relatively recent development, several significant policies preceded S. 1966 in an attempt to create foreign assistance structures for the improvement of international health. After World War II, Europe's requests for assistance resulted in the international community's establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1945. The U.S. responded in 1948 with the enactment of the Economic Cooperation Act and creation of the Marshall Plan which sought to stabilize Europe through temporary emergency assistance [7] . After the end of the Marshall Plan in 1951, Congress passed the first Mutual Security Act which paired military and economic programs with technical assistance as new foreign aid policy. In 1953, the Foreign Operations Administration was established as an independent government agency to consolidate international assistance. This agency merged into the International Cooperation Administration in 1954, which gave aid for the purposes of economic, political, and social development but remained quite limited in autonomy. In response to this shortcoming, the second Mutual Security Act was passed in 1954 while the Food for Peace Program introduced food aid in the same year [7] . Congress approved a revised Mutual Security Act in 1957 and despite great development of foreign aid policy by this time, there remained a need for a long-term foreign development program. This gap in policy contributed to the increasing dissatisfaction among the public and Congress with the U.S. foreign assistance structures already in place [7] .",

The FAA separated military and non-military aid and mandated the creation of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to promote and administer longterm assistance programs for the economic and social growth of developing countries [7] . The impact of current programs run by USAID is significant and has undoubtedly worked for the improvement of infant, child, and maternal health around the world. The U.S. has invested over $6 billion over the past 20 years in child survival programming run by USAID which has had great impact on child health [5] . For example, 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that USAID provided with assistance, experienced a decline in under-5 mortality by an average of 33% between 1996 and 2006, while some countries experienced as much as a 50% decrease in under-5 mortality [5] . While the FAA remains the prevailing and most effective foreign assistance legislation, disparities in child and maternal health in developing countries persist.",

The leaders declared that by 2015, the state of global health would be measurably improved with active progress by the international community towards the 8 key goals that are geared mainly towards children. Commitments to improving infant, child, and maternal health are reflected in MDG 4, to reduce child mortality by two thirds and MDG 5, to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015 [3] . With the deadline fastapproaching, maternal mortality has only declined by 5% between 1990 and 2005, while 91 developing countries are far behind their target of reducing child mortality and many have actually experienced a rise in rates since 1990 [3] .

Another component of this first goal calls for President Barack Obama to ''develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce mortality and improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries'' [5] . This part of the bill would be accomplished by compiling mortality data, assessing causes of mortality, assessing necessary investments for programs, and describing specific goals and objectives for improving infant, child, and maternal health among many more activities.

As S. 1966 does not detail funding appropriations by fiscal year, this information can be extrapolated from S. 1418, the U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007. This bill mandated an increase in funding to expand child and maternal health interventions including $600 million for fiscal year 2008, $900 million for 2009, $1.2 billion for 2010, and $1.6 billion each for 2011 and 2012 [14, 15] . As S. 1966 is very similar to its counterpart in 2007, it is reasonable to expect that the cost of the activities outlined in it will be similar to these figures. The lack of this type of information in the bill document poses a great barrier to its comprehensiveness and acceptance by Congress. Another issue concerning the authorization of appropriations is that the bill does not delineate possible sources of funding for the activities it describes. Along with the lack of funding context, the omission of funding sources and strategies weakens the persuasive power of the bill.",

While there is no doubt that U.S leadership in improving maternal and child health in developing countries will eventually require a multifaceted and complex approach, it is reasonable to expect that a bill that is too comprehensive may not appear feasible. Taking a lesson from the recent health care reform process, Congress tends to deal with smaller-scale bills more openly while maintaining transparency and wideranging input in the committee and floor procedures [16] . Taking smaller, more incremental steps that allow for experimentation and evaluation of results may be the only feasible approach to big problems such as global health disparities [16] . The current version of S. 1966, with its numerous activities, may very well be deliberated upon in committee for a long period of time and expire by the end of the current session of Congress just as its previous versions did.",

As it currently stands with its multiple activities towards achieving MDGs 4 and 5, S. 1966 may meet more success through more focused and incremental change. We suggest that the bill be revised to focus on a few key areas to help reduce infant, child, and maternal mortality. The areas of interest should be limited to breast feeding education initiatives, supplement distribution, and immunization programs. These three critical components have proven to positively impact maternal and child health. Breast feeding education initiatives are imperative for expecting and new mothers. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that ''if all babies and young children were breastfed exclusively for their first 6 months of life and then given nutritious complementary food with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age, the lives of an additional 1.5 million children under five would be saved every year'' [21] . With regards to low-cost supplements, the Global Action for Children notes that ''supplements given two to three times per year can prevent blindness and lower the risk of death from diarrhea, malaria and measles'' [22] . Although each capsule costs only two cents, an alarming 28 percent of children in developing countries are not receiving this preventive treatment [22] . Immunization programs are also cost-efficient and can drastically improve the lives of infants, children, and mothers by protecting them from diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis, tetanus, and polio. According to the WHO, ''more widespread use of low-cost vaccines could prevent 1.6 million deaths a year among children under the age of five'' [23] . By focusing the goals of S. 1966 on these three main components, it is more likely that it will progress through Congress successfully so that the U.S. can partner with developing countries to make significant improvements to health.",

The first clear benefit of enacting S. 1966 and investing in global health is that it would work to protect national security [24] . This is especially true when it comes to the spread of infectious diseases as demonstrated by the threat of recent outbreaks of SARS and H1N1 virus [24] . The Global Health Council describes disease as being potentially broad and borderless, as increased travel and trade mean that people and goods are carrying endemic pathogens to new places and populations [25] . Trade in agricultural products is just as high as international travel and has made foodborne illnesses and illnesses of animal origin more prevalent [25] . Stopping an outbreak when it emerges is more efficacious and cost-efficient than allowing it to become a global threat, and that requires stronger health services in developing countries where infectious disease is highest [24] . Another benefit to the U.S. that will result from enacting S. 1966 is that, just like the activities under the Global Health Initiative, it would be a ''tool of public diplomacy'' [24] . By giving mothers and children in developing countries care and support through the activities of S. 1966, the United States will send a more powerful message about the country's values and commitment to the international community.",

            "text": "By helping to reduce health disparities in infant, child, and maternal mortality through the actions of S. 1966, the U.S. will demonstrate sensitivity to other countries' needs in addition to those at home. When it comes to assisting developing countries, President Obama holds that ''We cannot simply confront individual preventable illnesses in isolation'' and that the interconnected world ''demands an integrated approach to global health'' [20] . S. 1966 calls for the development and establishment of a comprehensive strategy and a task force that will provide such an integrated approach to improvements in maternal and child health. The revisions suggested by the authors including clarity in funding options, a more narrowed focus, and evidence of local as well as global impact, will lead to S. 1966 being more likely to pass into law and leave a lasting legacy of collaboration and compassion. Bob Corker, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes that ''We have an opportunity through [S. 1966] to save the lives of more children and improve the health of mothers in developing nations'' [26] . Corker also holds that ''Maintaining U.S. investment in proven, cost-effective programs to combat poverty and disease overseas helps bring stability to unstable and often dangerous regions of the world, ultimately supporting our security interests both at home and abroad'' [26] . A revised S. 1966 will therefore empower the U.S. to improve international health and strengthen the global community.",
