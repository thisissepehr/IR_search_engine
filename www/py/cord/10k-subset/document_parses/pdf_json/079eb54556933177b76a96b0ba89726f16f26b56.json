The replication of vRNAs and the transcription of viral mRNAs are catalysed by the viral polymerase complex, which is composed of the PB2, PB1 and PA subunits. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity is encoded by the PB1 protein. The PB2 protein binds to the cap structure of host pre-mRNAs; the endonuclease activity of PA then cleaves the cap structure and the adjacent nucleotides from cellular pre-mRNAs, thereby creating short, capped mRNA primers that are elongated by PB1 for viral mRNA synthesis. All three polymerase subunits, together with the nucleoprotein (NP), are required for efficient influenza virus replication.",

In recent years, there have been large-scale outbreaks of avian influenza viruses in humans. Since their emergence in China in 1996, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses have caused 826 confirmed cases of human infection, resulting in 440 fatalities (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/ data as of 31 March 2015) . In 2013, H7N9 influenza viruses emerged in China and have since infected 4571 individuals, causing 212 deaths (http://www.who.int/entity/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/RiskAssessment_H7N9_23Feb20115.pdf; data as of 23 February 2015) . Rare cases of human infection have also been caused by avian influenza viruses of the H9N2, H6N1, H7N7, H10N8, H7N2 and H7N3 subtypes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] ; of these, human infections with H7N7 and H10N8 viruses have been fatal.",

            "text": "The haemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein and the polymerase complex affect the host range of influenza viruses [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The HA proteins of avian influenza viruses bind preferentially to a2,3-linked sialic acids, which are predominantly expressed on epithelial cells in the intestinal tract of aquatic birds 8 . By contrast, human influenza viruses bind preferentially to a2,6-linked sialic acids, which are prevalent on epithelial cells in the upper human airway 8 . In addition to HA-mediated host range restriction, the polymerase complex of avian influenza viruses is often restricted in its replicative ability in mammalian cells. This host range restriction may be a consequence of polymerase interactions with host-specific cellular proteins, and/or temperature differences between the intestinal tract of birds (38-41\u00b0C) and the upper respiratory tract of mammals (33\u00b0C). We 13 and others 14 identified the amino acid at position 627 of PB2 as a major host range determinant of influenza A viruses. In addition, the amino acids at positions 591 (refs 15,16) and 701 (refs 17,18) The significance of the influenza viral polymerase complex for host range restriction is now well established, primarily based on studies that compared viruses of high or low virulence in mammals. Although such studies led to the identification of host range determinants such as PB2-627, -591 and -701N, there may be additional, currently unknown amino-acid changes in the polymerase proteins that affect host range. The testing of all possible amino-acid changes in the polymerase proteins is not feasible; hence, no systematic efforts have been undertaken to catalogue potentially mammalian-adapting mutations in the viral polymerase complex. Therefore, in the present study, we implemented a high-throughput, reporter gene-based screening approach that allows the testing of large numbers of polymerase mutants. By using this approach, we identified several mutations in an avian H5N1 polymerase complex that increase polymerase activity in mammalian cells and virulence in mice.",

The replication of this virus is restricted to a cell line that stably expresses the HA protein. The TY93/H5N1 PB2 protein of this virus (termed TY93/ H5N1 GFP-627E) encodes glutamic acid at position 627, which restricts the replicative ability of avian H5N1 virus polymerase complexes in mammals 13 . As a control virus, we generated TY93/ H5N1 GFP-627K encoding the PB2-E627K mutation known to increase the replicative ability of avian influenza virus polymerase complexes in mammalian cells 13 . The replication-incompetent TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E and -E627 K viruses can be propagated in cell lines expressing the WSN-HA protein, but do not replicate in wild-type cells (Fig. 1b) .

Five hours later, we subjected cells to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. As expected, TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E replication was restricted in human 293-HA cells, resulting in low levels of GFP expression; by contrast, the PB2-E627K mutation conferred efficient replication and higher levels of GFP expression to TY93/H5N1 GFP in human 293-HA cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a,b) .

For PB2, we mixed the three libraries possessing mutations at positions 1-207, 208-394 and 395-587, resulting in a PB2 plasmid library with mutations at amino-acid positions 1-587. The C-terminal library encoding mutations at positions 588-759 of PB2 was not combined with the other three PB2 libraries because many of the mutations known to enhance the polymerase activity in mammalian cells (such as PB2-Q591K, -E627K and D701N) are located in this region. By using reverse genetics (Fig. 1b) , we then used the complementary DNA libraries to generate four different virus libraries that possess several random amino-acid mutations in PB2(1-587), PB2(588-759), PB1 and PA (Fig. 2 ).

Six hours later, we performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR Replicative ability of selected mutants in the genetic background of a low-pathogenic H5N1 variant. Our screens identified an appreciable number of mutations in the polymerase and NP proteins of TY93/H5N1. For further analyses, we focused on mutations that fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: (i) Mutations with a prevalence of Z30% based on deep-sequencing analysis (Supplementary Tables 2-5 ); (ii) Mutations identified in human H5N1 virus sequences deposited in the Influenza Research Database (http://www.fludb.org; accessed 1 September 2012); or (iii) Mutations located outside the region targeted for mutagenesis (for example, a mutation in PA isolated from the TY93/H5N1 PB1 mutant virus library). Based on these criteria, we selected 96 single, double or triple mutations in the polymerase and NP genes (Supplementary Data 1) for further characterization. Our GFP-FACS screens were carried out with HA-deficient virus maintained in HA-expressing cells. To test the effects of the selected mutations on influenza viruses that could replicate in normal cells, we introduced the mutations into a recombinant H5N1 virus. For biosafety reasons, the recombinant H5N1 virus possessed the TY93/H5N1 polymerase and NP genes in combination with the HA, NA, M and NS genes from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus; the HA gene of this virus has been modified to replace the multibasic sequence at the HA cleavage site with a single basic amino acid that renders the virus low pathogenic. We were able to introduce 85 of the selected mutations into replicating virus; however, 11 mutants could not be generated (Supplementary Data 1). To test the replicative ability of the 85 mutant viruses in mammalian cells, we infected human 293 cells (used because the GFP-FACS screens were carried out in this cell line) at an MOI of 0.001, and incubated them at 33 and 37\u00b0C (that is, the respective temperatures of the upper and lower respiratory tract of mammals). At 24, 48 and 72 h post infection, supernatants were harvested and viral replication was assessed by means of plaque assays in MDCK cells. Most mutations that conferred increased replication to the recombinant H5N1 virus in human cells were located in the C-terminal portion of PB2 (Supplementary Data 1), consistent with the role of this region in the host range and virulence of influenza viruses 15, 18, 26 . Among these mutations were the known mammalian-adapting PB2-Q591K, -E627K and -D701N changes; however, we also identified additional mutations in this region (such as PB2-E627V and -D701V) that increased the replicative ability of the recombinant H5N1 virus in humans cells. Moreover, several mutations in PB1 and PA increased the replication of the H5N1 virus in human cells at 33 and/or 37\u00b0C (Supplementary Data 1). Based on the viral growth properties in human 293 cells, the following 11 mutations were selected for further characterization: PA-T97I, PB1-N105S, PB2-E192K, -Q591K,  -E627K, -E627V, -D701N, -D701V, -K702R, -D740N and  -I758T (the PB2-Q591K , -E627K and -D701N mutations are known to enhance the replicative ability of avian H5N1 viruses in mammals [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 27 but were included here for comparison with the potentially novel markers of mammalian adaptation).",

To further assess the biological significance of the 11 selected mutations, we introduced them into authentic TY93/H5N1 virus and measured viral replication kinetics in three human cell lines: 293 cells, human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and human bronchial epithelial (Calu-3) cells ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Wild-type TY93/H5N1 virus did not replicate to detectable levels in A549 cells at 33\u00b0C (Fig. 3a) , underscoring the limited ability of avian H5N1 viruses to replicate in human cells at the temperature of the upper respiratory tract. By contrast, several mutations conferred this ability, demonstrating their growth-enhancing effect in mammalian cells. At 37\u00b0C, the PB2-627V and -701V mutants replicated to significantly higher titres than wild-type TY93/H5N1 virus at 24 h post infection ( Fig. 3a and Table 1 ). The PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N mutations are known to facilitate adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammals 13, 18, 26 , but the replication-enhancing effect in mammalian cells of the PB2-627V and -701V residues had not been described. In 293 and Calu-3 cells, TY93/H5N1 virus replicated to appreciable levels at 33 and 37\u00b0C ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ); similar to results obtained in A549 cells, most mutations increased the replicative ability of TY93/H5N1 at one or both temperatures tested (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Table 1 ).",

In mammalian cells, the higher virus titres detected for these mutants ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ) typically correlated with higher polymerase activity in minireplicon assays at 33 and/or 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4a,b and Table 1 ). The PB2-K702R and -D740N mutations did not have appreciable effects on polymerase activity in minireplicon assays, even though they conferred higher virus titres in A549 cells ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ). The relative increases in mammalian cells compared with wildtype TY93/H5N1 replicative ability were greater at 33\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C, most likely as a consequence of the low polymerase activity of TY93/H5N1 in mammalian cells at 33\u00b0C ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In avian DF-1 cells, several mutations including PB2-E192K, -Q591K, -E627K and -D740N conferred increased polymerase activity at 33\u00b0C compared with TY93/H5N1 ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ); however, these increases in polymerase activity did not result in increased virus titres in DF-1 cells (Fig. 3b and Table 1 ). Together, these data indicate that there is not always a strict correlation between replicative ability in minireplicon assays (which assess viral RNA replication and transcription) and virus titres (which reflect the entire viral life cycle). This is consistent with our earlier findings 19 and suggests that some of the mutations may affect steps in the viral life cycle other than vRNA transcription and/or replication, such as the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes.",

Our in vitro data identified several mutations in the TY93/H5N1 polymerase proteins that increased virus replication in mammalian cells. Next, we tested whether these increases translated to higher virulence in mice. Animals were infected intranasally with different doses of wild-type or mutant TY93/H5N1 viruses and observed for survival to determine the amount of virus required to kill 50% of the infected animals (mouse lethal dose 50; MLD 50 ; Table 6 ). All mutant viruses (with the exception of TY93/H5N1 PB2-D740N) had a lower MLD 50 value than that of the wild-type virus, demonstrating increased virulence in mice compared with TY93/H5N1 virus. The greatest virulence in mice was detected for the PB1-N105S and PB2-E192K mutants, for which infection with one plaqueforming unit (p.f.u.) resulted in such severe clinical symptoms that all (for PB1-N105S) or two (PB2-E192K) of the infected mice had to be euthanized. The PB1-N105S mutant did not significantly increase the TY93/H5N1 polymerase activity in minireplicon assays (Fig. 4) , again suggesting that the polymerase mutations influence steps beyond vRNA replication and transcription. We also found that the newly identified PB2-627V and -701V mutations had MLD 50 values identical to those of the known PB2-627 K and -701 N mutants, respectively (Supplementary Table 6 ). Mice infected with these viruses succumbed rapidly to infection (Fig. 5 ).",

The PB2-740N mutant was not isolated from nasal turbinates, even though it replicated efficiently in the lungs of infected mice. Virus titres in the brains of infected mice differed greatly on day 5 post infection, ranging from undetectable to 410 6 p.f.u. per g for mice infected with PB2-701N, and 410 7 p.f.u. per g for a mouse infected with PB2-701V. Collectively, these data demonstrate that some of the mutations identified through our high-throughput screening approach increased the virulence of an avian H5N1 influenza virus in mice. ",

            "text": "By using a high-throughput screening approach, we identified several mutations in an avian H5N1 influenza virus polymerase complex that increase the replicative ability and virulence of the virus, and may facilitate avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Previous studies to identify mutations that promote mammalian adaptation and increase the virulence of avian influenza viruses have typically relied on the experimental and/or computational identification of signature amino-acid mutations found in natural isolates [28] [29] [30] , or on sequential virus passages in mice 24,31,32 , ferrets 33 or swine 34 (an approach known to increase virulence). However, sequential passages of avian H5N1 influenza viruses in mammals often lead to the selection of the dominant PB2-E627K (refs 35-37) mutation, which may mask the emergence of other adaptive mutations. The identification of host-adaptive mutations through sequence analysis is typically challenging because the observed mutations may be random and not associated with any adaptive advantage. To circumvent these potential drawbacks, we utilized a random mutagenesis approach to create a large pool of diverse mutants, followed by a screening process for variants that replicate efficiently in mammalian cells. This approach led us to identify specific mutations in the polymerase complex that, to the best of our knowledge, have never been reported as mammalian-adapting mutations, namely PB2-E192K, -E627V, -D701V, -K702R and PB1-N105S. Glutamic acid is typically found at position 627 of PB2 in avian influenza viruses. Most human influenza viruses, with the exception of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses, encode lysine at this position. Replication of avian influenza viruses in mice or humans frequently leads to the emergence of the PB2-E627K mutation 26, [38] [39] [40] [41] . Lysine at position 627 is part of a basic patch at the surface of PB2, which is disrupted by a glutamic acid residue at this position 42, 43 . This patch may be essential for the interaction of PB2 with host factors. The valine residue at position 627 of PB2 would result in a slightly basic surface patch. The PB2-627V mutation increased viral replication in mammalian cells and virulence in mice compared with PB2-627E; in fact, the replicative ability and virulence of TY93/ H5N1 encoding PB2-627V were comparable to that of the virus encoding the mammalian-adapting PB2-627 K residue. A recent study found that the PB2-627V mutation slightly reduced replicative ability in vitro compared with PB2-627K (ref. 44); however, this study was carried out in the background of the cell culture-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. Although we found that TY93/H5N1 viruses encoding PB2-627K or -627V have comparable replicative ability and mouse virulence, the PB2-627V variant is rarely found in natural influenza isolates. To date, it has only been detected in a single H7N9 human isolate (A/Hong Kong/5731/2014), five H1N1 swine isolates, a single H7N1 avian isolate (A/Pekin robin/California/30412/1994) and in several H9N2 isolates from poultry farms in Egypt and Israel between 2000 and 2013; ref. 45) . We speculate that the type of nucleotide mutation may contribute to the selection of PB2-E627K over PB2-E627V: glutamic acid can mutate to lysine with a transition mutation in the first position (G to A); by contrast, the conversion of glutamic acid to valine requires a transversion mutation (GAG to GTG). Transition mutations are (de)aminations, whereas transversions require an exchange between a pyrimidine and a purine structure. Consequently, the transition:transversion ratio is reported to be B10: 1 (refs 46,47) . This result highlights an advantage of our approach: by starting with error-prone PCR-generated virus libraries possessing random mutations, we were able to identify a novel putative mammalian-adapting mutation that had not been identified through surveillance or virus passages, likely due to its rare occurrence.",

Similar to the PB2-E627K and -627V mutations discussed earlier, the commonly found PB2-D701N mutation can be achieved through a transition mutation, whereas the PB2-D701V mutation requires a transversion, possibly explaining why it is rarely found among natural isolates. Based on computational analyses, position 702 in the PB2 protein has been suggested as a host marker [50] [51] [52] . Most human influenza viruses encode arginine at this position, whereas avian influenza viruses typically possess lysine. The finding of seven human H5N1 viruses that encode PB2-702R (AF258843, AF258845, EU146728, CY014356, CY014359, CY014360 and AF258849) may further suggest a mammalian-adapting function for this residue. Our experimental data support this concept: TY93/H5N1 encoding PB2-702R replicated efficiently in mammalian cells and in the lungs of infected animals, and its MLD 50 value was lower than that of wild-type TY93/H5N1 virus (encoding PB2-702K). Given that this residue is located adjacent to the known mammalian-adapting marker at position 701 (see previous paragraph), the amino acid at position 702 may affect virulence and host range by modulating the interaction of PB2 with a-importins 27, 48 .",

First, a multisegment RT-PCR comprising 25 cycles was performed for each sample. Next, nested PCR reactions comprised of 28 cycles were performed to generate two overlapping amplicons for each polymerase segment and a single amplicon for the NP segment. All primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 7 . Nested amplicons were then combined into an amplicon pool, which was purified by using AMPure Beads (Beckman Coulter). The purified amplicon pool was processed with the Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies) to generate sheared, barcoded and size-selected Ion Torrent PGM 200-base libraries, and then amplified in eight additional PCR cycles to increase the number of barcoded library fragments. Final pools for sequence analysis were constructed by combining equimolar amounts of the individually barcoded libraries (which correspond to a single isolate). The pools were then sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM with 314 chips. Basecalling was performed by using TraceTuner 59 , and the resulting sequences were quality-trimmed and then assembled using the merger utility from the EMBOSS software suite 60 . All processing steps were integrated into a reproducible Galaxy 61 workflow and are available upon request. The resulting assembled sequences were analysed by using the Galaxy bioinformatics suite 61 and the Integrative Genomics Viewer 62 .",

Next, we built a contrast matrix to compare the strains in a pairwise fashion at the same time points. The P values were adjusted by using Holm's method to account for multiple comparisons.

Staff working in BSL3Ag wear disposable overalls and powered air-purifying respirators that filter the air, and shower out on exit from the facility. The BSL3Ag facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was designed to exceed the standards outlined in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (5th edition; http://www.cdc.gov/ biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf). Features include controlled access, entry/exit through a shower change room, effluent decontamination, negative airpressure, double-door autoclaves, gas decontamination ports, plus HEPA-filtered supply and double-HEPA-filtered exhaust air, double-gasketed watertight and airtight seals, airtight dampers on all ductwork, and the structure is pressure-decay tested regularly. The University of Wisconsin-Madison facility has a dedicated alarm system that monitors all building controls and sends alarms (B500 possible alerts). Redundancies and emergency resources are built-in to the facility including two air handlers, two compressors, two filters in each location where filters are needed, two effluent sterilization tanks, two power feeds to the building, an emergency generator in case of a power failure and other physical containment measures in the facility that operate without power. Biosecurity monitoring of the facility is ongoing. All personnel undergo Select Agent security risk assessment by the United States Criminal Justice Information Services Division and complete rigorous biosafety, BSL3 and Select Agent training before participating in BSL3level experiments. Refresher training, including drills and review of emergency plans, is scheduled on a regular basis. The principal investigator participates in training sessions and emphasizes compliance to maintain safe operations and a responsible research environment. The laboratory occupational health plan is in compliance with the University of Wisconsin-Madison Occupational Medicine Program. Select Agent virus inventory, secured behind two physical barriers, is checked each month and documentation is submitted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Select Agent Program Manager. Updates on virus inventory (which is carried out every month) are submitted 1-2 times per year to the file holder in the Select Agent branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The research programme, procedures, occupational health plan, documentation, security and facilities are reviewed annually by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Responsible Official and at regular intervals by the CDC, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Select Agent Program.",

The mutant virus libraries were generated similarly but we replaced the wild-type pPolI plasmid for PB2, PB1 or PA with the corresponding mutant plasmid library. Mutant virus library stocks were generated in 293-HA cells, and titres were determined by plaque assay in MDCK-HA cells.

At 1 h post infection, virus supernatant was removed and replaced with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/MEM infection media. At 4 h post infection, cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in 0.3% BSA/MEM. FACS was carried out using a FACSAria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) equipped with the FACSDiva software suite (BD Biosciences). A baseline fluorescence level was determined by analysing 10,000 cells infected with parental TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E virus. The cell sorting gate was then set to capture cells infected with a mutant virus library that expressed GFP at higher intensity than that observed for TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E. The cell sorting gate was adjusted every hour by analysing 10,000 cells infected with TY93/H5N1 GFP-627E virus. Single cells with increased GFP expression levels were sorted into 96-well plates seeded with 1.5 \u00c2 10 5 MDCK-HA cells per well and incubated at 37\u00b0C.
