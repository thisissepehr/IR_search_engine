It is known that chronic sleep deprivations is associated with poorer developmental outcome, overweight and behavioral disturbances. Clinicians should incorporate questions about sleep into their routine health assessment, and the assessment of insomnia should follow a medical approach. Primary and secondary contributing factors should be assessed, as well as maladaptive behaviors related to sleep. In order to identify childhood insomnia clinicians must be willing to observe children and listen to them closely. Symptoms of pediatric insomnia may include: difficulties falling asleep, episodes of waking up in the night with inability to go back to sleep or waking up early in the morning. Patients may be chronically tired or show academic or behavioral difficulties, with hyperactive components.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A careful examination of sleep/wake schedule, abnormal movements or behavior during sleep, and daytime consequences of sleep disruption or deprivation is mandatory. Sleeping environment and bedtime routines should be examined to identify behavioral issues related to sleep. Polysomnography is not routinely indicated for children with insomnia, but actigraphy can give an objective estimation of sleep parameters. All medical treatments for chronic pediatric insomnia are off label, but advances in clinical evidence are emerging; behavioral therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy provide non-pharmacologic alternatives that help rewire disrupted sleep patterns and sleep hygiene should be implemented. The aim of the present talk is to summarize recent advances in the field of clinical pediatric sleep medicine: a phenotype-based classification of pediatric insomnia, based on both genetic and clinical aspects is proposed; clinical evaluation, short time and chronic sequelae are described; several tools for clinical assessment and treatment options of paediatric insomnia, useful in the daily clinical practice of pediatricians, are presented. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only currently available treatment that targets the etio-pathophysiology and may modulate the natural history of IgE-mediated diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Childhood represents the best timeframe to influence the immune system and alter the progression of allergic diseases during the early phases of respiratory allergic diseases [3, 6] . There is evidence that AIT constitutes a suitable therapeutic option to be considered in patients suffering from allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (AR) due to grass pollen and wishing to take advantage of AIT's long-term effect (at least one year after cessation of AIT course) on AR and its potential preventive effect on asthma development [1] . AIT might be a strategy to prevent the development of new sensitization(s) [3, 6] . Furthermore, a growing body of evidence support the use of oral immunotherapy as a promising treatment option in children with persistent IgE-mediated food allergy [2, 5] . The efficacy of AIT is under investigation also in patients with extrinsic atopic dermatitis, currently with controversial results. Overall, the interest and the attention to AIT treatment are currently fervent and increasing. However, there are still some methodological criticisms and gaps to be filled in the current body of evidence: a) the regimen of administration and the amount of the maintenance dose are both largely variable; b) the protocols of administration are not standardized; c) the description and classification of side effects is variable among studies and needs to be standardized; d) quality of life and evaluation of health economics are overall missing. All these aspects make difficult to compare each study with another. In addition, the content of major allergen(s) remains largely variable among manufacturers and the availability of AIT products differences among countries. The development of integrated care pathways incorporating (educating and training) primary and secondary care, as well as the availability of high quality AIT products and global actions aimed to develop a harmonized international approach to regulate AIT products are awaited in order to implement AIT in clinical practice. Well-designed studies are awaited in the near future in order to overcome the current gaps in the evidence and furtherly promote implementation strategies with the final goal of a \"precision medicine/prevention\", tailored on each specific clinical sub-group.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1325, "end": 1328, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1332, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1336, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1340, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1344, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1348, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1529, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1532, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1876, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1957, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1960, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2130, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2133, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The improvements in the sanity field have led to an increase of chronic diseases in spite of acute ones.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition of childhood with significant associated morbidity. The comprehensive evaluation of children who present with suggestive symptoms involves the overnight recording and assessment of both sleep and respiration by polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. The common symptom of pediatric OSAHS include snoring, restless sleep, struggling to breathe, abnormal paradoxical chest/abdomen motion, mouth breathing, failure-to-thrive. Obesity and excessive daytime sleepiness are present. The studies demonstrate that pediatric OSAHS are characterized by partial upper airway obstruction, more or less apnea and associated with staged desaturation. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI), lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2) and desaturation index below 90% (SIT90%) are very important factors to measure about serious degree of pediatric OSAHS. Physical examination, subjective symptoms and clinical history, these three items were used to create a sleep clinical score (SCS).

The negative effects that endocrine disruptors have on health are multiple: from prenatal damage during the development of the central nervous system with consequent cognitive and behavioral impairment, to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Scientific evidence also indicate endocrine disruptors as substances that can reduce fertility through a reduction in sperm count, cause anomalies in the development of external genitalia in males (cryptorchidism), and alter the morphology of the penis (reduced dimensions or anomalous urethral opening). In females these substances seem to contribute to precocious breast development (thelarche), which has been evidenced in several countries including Italy. It is therefore important for the Pediatrician to transmit concrete information regarding this subject to patients and families in order to apply correct behaviors that may reduce exposure to endocrine disruptors. The development of a new vaccine aims at meeting medical and public health needs, making use of scientific knowledge and technological achievements [1] . Inactivation and attenuation still remain the main processes of vaccine production, but different modern techniques in molecular biology and genetic engineering led to the development and manufacturing of new inactivated antigens and attenuated pathogens [2] . Vaccine manufactured with new technologies are used in the immunization practice for some time. Hepatitis B vaccines produced in yeast by recombinant DNA technology have now been available for over twenty-five years, replacing those based on purification of plasma of infected individuals, and consenting the implementation of large vaccination programs [3] . Recently, other recombinant vaccines have been created (HPV, malaria, Herpes Zoster and others). Moreover, the sequencing of microbial genomes allowed the identification of new protective factors and the expression of the predicted genes in bacteria: the resulting proteins can be used to immunize against specific diseases (reverse vaccinology) [4] . Also, vectored vaccines were developed utilizing non-pathogenic viruses as carriers that incorporate and express the gene for a pathogen [5] (Dengue, HIV, etc.). Despite these attainments, production of some vaccines extensively employed in public health programs, such as measles, remains anchored to \"old\" technologies, and development of vaccines against important still non-preventable pathologies has been unsuccessful so far, although several new projects are ongoing. The pharmaceutical and clinical development of new vaccines lasts several years or indefinitely [6] . Indeed, their development represents a sort of continuum: following the marketing authorization, effectiveness studies, post-marketing surveillance and phase IV clinical trials may lead to changes in the pharmaceutical formulation and to applications for new indications. In the recent history, different examples show how the scientific and technological progress has allowed researchers and producers not only to develop new vaccines, but also to re-develop those needing improvement, thus increasing the potentialities and benefits of vaccination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1172, "end": 1175, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1436, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1796, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2145, "end": 2148, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2288, "end": 2291, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2725, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Sepsis is associated with substantial morbidity in hospitalized children, remaining one of the leading causes of death, even in advanced countries. [1] Data from 15 Italian Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) reported mortality as high as 50% in children with septic shock. [2] To improve such dismal outcome, specific protocols for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have been adopted by several centers worldwide. Most of these protocols are derived from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines (SSCG), which were first released in 2008 and regularly updated since then. [3, 4] Key elements for appropriate treatment of sepsis are similar both in adults and children, including early recognition and rapid establishment of early goal-directed therapy. A small set of evidencebased practices, such as optimal fluid resuscitation, administration of broad spectrum antibiotics and use of inotropic or vasopressor agents, constitute a \"sepsis bundle\", a tool to be timely applied adopting specific algorithms. [5, 6] Indeed, implementation of sepsis bundles by quality improvement strategies have been associated with improved outcomes in the emergency department (ED), such as reduced mortality and length of hospital stay. [7, 8] However, implementation and maintenance of adherence of SSCG are not easy tasks. Workman et al. evaluated the association between timely delivery of therapy (three elements of a bundle, to be accomplished within 1 hour) and development of multiple organ failure in 321 children presenting in ED with septic shock. [9] Of note, only 36% of patients received all bundle measures within 1 hour. Interestingly, the majority of remaining patients did so within 3 hours, showing comparable primary and secondary outcomes, raising doubts about the need to keep the \"septic shock clock\" always so strict. [10] In a prospective study, Paul et al. investigated adherence to SSCG in their pediatric ED, looking at five time-specific goals, i.e. early recognition, vascular access, fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotic administration. Of note, just a minority of patients were treated according to the SSCG. Yet, after launching vigorous quality improvement initiatives among their ED staff, they achieved an impressively higher and sustained adherence to the SSCG algorithm. [7] In conclusion, early recognition and rapid protocolized treatment are essential for children with septic shock. A timely application of sepsis bundles may markedly improve performance in the management of these very sick patients, potentially ameliorating their outcome. Further studies are needed to provide stronger evidence about the effectiveness of sepsis bundles, as well as to consistently increase the overall adherence to the new sepsis guidelines. Respiratory failure is a condition of inadequate gas exchange. There is a wide range of causes, in children, leading to acute or chronic respiratory failure due either to progressive lung disease, or to respiratory pump function deficit that can be grouped into three main categories: a loss of central respiratory drive to breathe; ineffective thoracic musculoskeletal function; disorders of the respiratory tract [1, 2] . The latter group includes children with progressive neuromuscular disorders (NMD). These patients undergo major respiratory complications for many reasons including inspiratory muscles weakness and ineffective cough; scoliosis due to decreased muscle support; decreased spontaneous movement, which reduces the normal redistribution of ventilation; high prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux and weakness of the facial, oropharyngeal, and laryngeal muscles that can result in a compromised swallow and secretion clearance. It has been reported the effect of upper respiratory tract infections on reductions in respiratory muscle strength and, consequently, cause symptoms like shortness of breath, reduction in vital capacity, and acute hypercapnia. Low respiratory infections increase respiratory load, increasing the stiffness of the lung (as atelectasis) and increasing respiratory rate. [3, 4, 5] . All NMD patients must learn appropriate airway clearance techniques and introduce cough-machine. Patients with limited respiratory function must also be trained in Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). It is important to intercept, treat and prevent respiratory infections because the rate of them affects the child and family's quality of life. Discussions about prognosis and how far treatment should go in the event of deterioration should take place in every progressive NMD and patient with progressive chronic respiratory failure, with active involvement of the patient and family [6, 7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 151, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 595, "end": 597, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1029, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1032, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1244, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1247, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1849, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1898, "text": "Paul et al. investigated", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2312, "end": 2315, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3189, "end": 3192, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3195, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4090, "end": 4093, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4094, "end": 4096, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4097, "end": 4099, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4683, "end": 4686, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4687, "end": 4689, "text": "7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Receiving support from a multidisciplinary care medical team can make a difference in the life of the patient with respiratory failure and his/her family.

Tall subjects having an abnormal appearance can be divided into proportionate and disproportionate syndromic patients. Before initiating further investigations, the clinician needs to perform both careful physical examination and growth evaluation. To exclude pathological conditions, the causes of pathological tall stature need to be considered, although most children are healthy and generally do not require treatment to cease growth progression. In specific cases, a familial tall stature subject can be treated by inducing puberty early with the aim of inducing early complete fusion of the epiphyses and achievement of final height. Referrals to a pediatric endocrinologist for assessment of a child with tall stature are much less frequent than for short stature. This is because tall stature has a wider social acceptance. Child tuberculosis (TB) is a silent epidemic involving about one million children each year; of those, nearly one in four die. Children with TB rarely die if they receive standard treatment, but 90% of them worldwide are left untreated. This widespread neglect means the loss of a million children every four years, a not acceptable tragedy if we consider that TB is a preventable, treatable and curable disease. Considering that equal access to medical care is a basic human right, the continuing medical neglect of child TB constitutes a real human rights violation. This neglect can no longer be excused nor accepted not only by political institutions, but also by medical organizations and by every single doctors, particularly pediatricians. Ending the child TB epidemic requires local interventions, sensitive to social and cultural context, to reach at-risk children using simple tools for active screening and diagnosis. Even in resource-limited areas, projects like DETECT Child TB are demonstrating that medical professionals diagnose and treat TB in children, even at the community level. Screening households where an adult is diagnosed with TB to see if children have been exposed in the home must become the standard implemented everywhere.

Revision of the available diagnostic methods described in English Literature for pathogen identification. Polymerase chain reaction methods can identify pathogens in approximately 6 hours directly from biological fluids, some kits disclosing the presence of genes related to antibiotic resistance. Identification is not influenced by the antinfective therapies prescribed, however it is limited to the kit pathogen panel and both false positive (e.g. contamination) and false negative results (e.g. poor pathogen load) may be obtained [1, 2, 3] . Mass spectrometry is performed on positive cultures: pathogen identification may be accelerated of about 48 hours compared to traditional methods. \"Protein spectres\" are compared to those encoded in the kit library, so that identification is limited to the species here collected. Methods to identify resistance profiles through mass spectrometry are in progress [4] . Traditional methods as standard identification from cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing are based on EUCAST guidelines [5] . Pathogen isolation and susceptibility testing on positive cultures remain the gold standard for microbiological diagnosis in infectious diseases. However, mass spectrometry and polymerase chain reaction methods could be adjunctive diagnostic tools for an early diagnosis. [1] . The comparative studies have confirmed that the first traces of humans have appeared in the Northern Tanzania and that the migration process known as \"out of Africa\" has started from that area of the world for further colonization of all lands of the planet. Skin color is one of the most conspicuous ways in which humans vary and has been widely used to define human races. Recent studies have definitely proven that the variations in skin color are adaptive and related to the regulation of ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetration in the integument and its direct and indirect effect on good health [2] . The earliest members of the mankind lineage probably had a mostly unpigmented or lightly pigmented integument covered by dark black hairs, similar to that of the modern chimpanzee [3] . The evolution of a naked, darkly pigmented skin occurred early in the evolution of the genus Homo. A dark epidermis protected sweat glands from UVinduced injury, thus insuring the integrity of thermoregulation. Of greater significance in individual reproductive success was that highly melanized skin protected against UV-induced proteolysis of folate, a metabolite that is essential for normal development of the embryonic neural tube and spermatogenesis. As hominides migrated out of Africa, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UV-induced synthesis of previtamin D3. Generally speaking the impact of UV-eradiation on skin increases by latitude and decreases by altitude. Recent observations explain the apparent exceptions to the general rule, like the Ituin group in Eskimo population. In general, females require a lighter color of the skin to synthesize more amounts of Vitamin 3, necessary during pregnancy and location [3] . Thus skin coloration in humans is adaptive and labile. Skin pigmentation levels have changed more than once in human evolution (similar to the alternation of glaciation and desertification). Because of that, the skin coloration should not be considered of value in determining phylogenetic relationship among modern human groups. An ongoing research project supported by two Italian ONLUS Associations (\"Friends Raising\" and \"Alpha-1-antiyrypsin\") is aimed to search in the population of Northern Tanzania the pathogenetic mutations that have been detected in Europe, Asia, America, Oceania and to verify their role ibn the development of cryptogenic cirrhosis and HCC [4] that carry a high incidence in that area of the world. The background of the project is based upon two robust points: the \"out of Africa\" migration process and upon the finding of pathogenetic mutations in black Americans (Afro-Americans) [5] who have moved from the black Africa to America in more recent years for reason other than the original \"out of Africa\".

It does not require particular instruments, but only of a regular systematic approach which is the essential prerequisite for a longitudinal analysis. A child is in good health if her/his growth complies with her/his genetic potential in accordance to normality parameters, namely according to percentiles and z-scores for age and sex.

Functional forms are much more common than organic ones. Diagnosis and therapy of functional UI are based on noninvasive diagnostic evaluation. Urotherapy is the most important therapeutic cornerstone. Phytotherapy has ancient origins but despite this, even today, its use for health purposes is widespread in both adults and children. Many food supplements on the market, contain, among their components, plant extracts. This aspect is particulary relevant in Italy, where the use of food supplements containing plant extracts (botanicals) prevails compared to herbal medicines, unlike what happens in other European Countries. However, there is a marked difference, both from a regulatory point of view and sales to the public, between botanicals and herbal drugs. The main differences, however, concern their clinical use: food supplements can in fact maintain, optimize or support a function, but cannot boast a therapeutic action, that is the sole competence of drugs [1] . It should however be pointed out that plant extracts, whether they are drugs or food supplements, have important biological/pharmacological actions, interactions and even possible adverse side effects [2] . In the pediatric environment, there are plants or their extracts, which cannot be used or have age limits, others that require a dose reduction or caution. [3] It is therefore necessary to have a phytotherapy approach based on criteria and scientific evidence (Monographs, RCTs, clinical studies), exactly as for the medicine that uses synthetic drugs, always having in mind the need to operate according to \"science and conscience\" and the always valide principle \"primum non nocere\". To disseminate these concepts, in 2015, the Italian Federation of Pediatricians (FIMP) published the document \"Linee guida di fitoterapia\" [4] . The purpose of this report is to provide pediatricians with the skills to be able to advise, according to criteria of safety and effectiveness, the use of plant extracts in child care. Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common tumors of infancy with a prevalence of 2.6-4.5%. IHs are benign vascular tumors. They are characterized by a typical clinical history: they manifest within the first weeks of life, followed by a rapid proliferative phase during the first 5-6 month, a stabilization phase at approximately 8-10 months of age and a successive spontaneous involution over the next 6-7 years. Oral treatment is indicated for ulcerated IHs, IHs at risk for life, those with potential functional or relevant aesthetic sequela [1] . During the last 10 years, treatment of IHs significantly changed after the accidental discovery of efficacy of oral propranolol, a betablocking drug, already used in cardiology [2] . The European Consensus of 2015 defines propranolol as the first line therapy for IHs, especially during proliferative phase of IHs, between the second and the fifth month of life.

What paediatricians should do: catching early signals to identify difficulties of the adolescents; during health state evaluation at a 12-14 year-old, making simple questions to eventually identify inconveniences, e.g.: How are you? Tell me something about what you do every day? Have you got friends? Carefully observe behaviours, just as a listener, avoiding expressing judgements, following the pace of the patient without imposing pressure and finally avoiding devalueing or trivialising the distress, understanding whether there are specific synptoms (depressed mood, melancholy, weeping, irascibility, loosing of interests or anger crisis); looking for alterations in sleepiness (hypersomnia, insomnia), nutrition (lack of appetite or bulimia nervosa), level of energy (fatigue) or will to undertake new activities; noticing whether melancholy is replaced by rage, as often happens, being the only way adolescents can express their distress.

The definition of short stature may vary, but it is commonly defined as a height is 2 standard deviations (SD) or more below the mean for children of that sex and chronologic age (and ideally of the same racial-ethnic group). The first thing first that a paediatrician must rule out is whether the short stature is a variant of normal growth or caused by a disease. When diseases like inflammatory bowel diseases, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, thyroid or adrenal diseases are excluded, then the most frequent causes of short stature are familial short stature (FSS), idiopathic short stature (ISS) and constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP). The diagnosis of the causes underlying short stature sometimes is not easy and availability of growth velocity and growth trajectory is very important for a proper evaluation of a child with short stature. Assessing the severity of the short stature is also important to facilitate decisions about intervention, when appropriate. In recent years research has given a major contribution to facilitate the deciphering of short stature, with particular reference to discovering of new genes regulating the secretion of GH, IGF-1, ALS, etc. and new molecular mechanisms underlying growth and growth defects (ACAN, PAPPA-2, etc.). When a diagnosis is made, then the decision to treat or not to treat with GH must be taken; children with GH deficiency, Turner syndrome, SGA, may respond very well to treatment and increase their final height significantly. In other children the outcomes are less advantageous. The incomparable protective importance and highly favorable cost/ effective ratio of immunizations is particularly evident in preterm newborns, who, due to complications of prematurity, are more vulnerable to the harmful consequences of infectious diseases preventable by vaccination. Preterm infants, especially those with birth weight < 1500 g, may present a reduction of immune response as compared to term infants. Nevertheless, several studies, carried out to evaluate response to vaccination, suggested that they showed a satisfactory response to immunization and developed protective serum antibody levels, including the PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 pneumococcal vaccine, although slightly reduced as compared to term infants [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In those at higher risk, an additional booster dose may be warranted in order to ensure a similar response to that of term infants, as in the case of hepatitis B vaccine in infants with birth weight <2000 g.

A series of strategies can be carried out in order to create organizational models that aim to increase vaccination coverage. Among these, especially with regards to the developmental age and adolescence, there are health education interventions and the administration of vaccinations in alternative settings. The School, for example, represents the ideal setting for the development of such actions [1] .

Similarly, the organization of joint assessment meetings of vaccination coverage for a single pediatrician, led to an average increase in vaccination coverage of about 10%.

It is difficult to estimate its incidence because not all the abused children reach the medical system [9] . For these reasons, long since the scientific community is working hard to identify certain data in order to reach accurate diagnosis of AHT. Several studies have demonstrated programs are effective in reducing the incidence of the syndrome. Starting from a national network of centres of excellence equipped with a protection team at five main teaching third -level hospitals, coordinated by the no profit organization Terre des Hommes, the prevention strategy, the target population and the main message were defined, according to the evidence derived from the international literature review combined with the expert in-the-field experiences. A prevention TV video spot and few synthetic parents-friendly information was provided in the first Italian dedicated web-site [www.nonscuoterlo.it]. This campaign represent an important step towards the prevention of SBS/AHT. In 2008 were published the first recommendations for the use and interpretation of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in children [1] . In the American guideline for screening and Management of high blood pressure, published in 2017, the rule and importance of ABPM in children was emphasized [2] . ABPM is more accurate for diagnosis of Hypertension (HTN) than office-measured blood pressure (BP), is more reproducible than home BP and more predictive of adult BP than office BP. In addition ABPM is superior to office BP to identify patients at the highest risk for target organ damage. ABPM values correlates with left ventricular hypertrophy and carotid intima media thickness, known cardiovascular risk factor. Data provided by ABPM consist of the mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure values recorded during 24 h and, separately, during daytime and nighttime. The suggested frequency of the measurements is 3-4 per hour during daytime and 2-3 per hour during the night. At least 1 or 2 valid readings should be obtained per hour to consider an ABPM interpretable. According to Guidelines ABPM is useful to confirm HTN in children with office elevate BP values and permit to identify white coat HYT (elevated office BP, normal BP on ABPM) or masked HYT (normal office BP, elevated BP on ABPM). ABPM make it possible to verify the efficacy of therapy, especially when clinic or home BP measurements indicate insufficient BP response. Finally it is useful for the assessment of BP variability, the circadian BP decline from day to night called \"dipping\" should be > 10% and BP load. BP load excess of 25% is considered abnormal. The American Guidelines recommend routine use of ABPM in children with high-risk conditions: secondary HYT, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, solid-organ transplant, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and in some genetic syndrome (neurofibromatosis, Williams). As we reported in a recent publication [3] however, some critical points concerning its use. In particular, the lack of solid reference values for normal subjects within an age range of 5-16 years and the use of appropriate cuff size and validated monitors. In conclusion in the last years the use of ABPM is increasing. ABPM was recognized useful to identify and classify children with HTN, but we need more normative ABPM data across sex, race and age.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 162, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 324, "end": 327, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 433, "end": 436, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1458, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1621, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3278, "end": 3281, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A27"}, {"text": "Network treatment of childhood obesity: family-school-healthcare systems Vita Cupertino 1 , Rita Tanas Treatment of pediatric/adolescent obesity is of interest for the entire community in terms of multifactoriality and comorbidity. All isolated strategies result less or at all efficacious [1] [2] . The child interacts with the environment. Besides family, other microsystems play a role in his development: school, work, church, recreation and sports [3] . Family is the main actor of changes, at least until age 10-12 years, but it is not enough to work only with it during the adolescence. The adolescent should be sustained in his maturation and need of autonomy, ensuring support for motivation, self-esteem and self-efficacy [4] . School (peers, teachers and the entire system) is decisive for relationships, and, therefore, it is a privileged place for implementation of prevention and treatment. In healthcare a network of services is necessary. Different professionals should be involved with shared training and a life-course approach. Professionals should be trained to work on different levels with a shared method and to cooperate in teams. Food and sport lifestyles should be approached with therapeutic education and motivational interviews [2, 5] . In the first healthcare level the primary care pediatrician represents the main reference for child/adolescent with obesity and his family. Besides prevention and identification of children who should undergone treatment, his task is to motivate the family towards treatment and support them in time, act as a mediator, participate in decisions when a superior level intervention is required [6] . The second level should receive secondary, severe, already complicated or unresponsive patients [7] . It should be organized by health districts and requires a multidisciplinary team, which includes a pediatrician, a dietitian and a psychologist with documented experience. The role of the team is to define the patient's clinical picture and activate a personalized multidisciplinary therapeutic intervention. If severe comorbidities persist, patient should be sent to third level care in specialized centers for the evaluation and treatment of comorbidities on a multidisciplinary basis, including a possible surgical approach [5] . The main obstacles to success of this model, that currently needs to be created or completed in most Italian regions, are the persistence of prejudice on obesity as an exclusive personal responsibility, the failure to recognize obesity as a chronic disease and the lack of coordination among healthcare levels, especially between primary care and multidisciplinary teams. Coordination must be created, maintained and adapted to family's and patient's needs. [8] Genetic syndromes are complex conditions characterised by the association of congenital abnormalities with dysmorphisms, and in which staturo-ponderal growth problems, psychomotor delay, intellectual disability (ID) and behavioural disorders are frequent. Patients presenting these characteristics are often referred to specialist paediatric neurology: clearly, those operating in such settings need to possess specific diagnostic expertise, not only in order to ensure targeted therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions , but also to be able to inform families as to the risk of recurrence. [1] Diagnosing these syndromes means following a rigorous procedure in which the first step is collection of a detailed history of the family and of the patient himself: pre-natal, neonatal, physiological and pathological. This is followed by clinical investigation which involves primary neurological examination, including exploration of intellectual and behavioral aspects. Neurologic exam allow to identify neurological signs expression of involvement of central nervous system (pyramidal, extra-pyramidal or cerebellar) or peripheral nervous system. Assessment of cognitive functioning is another important step for identification and characterization of ID that often complicates a genetic syndrome. ID is a condition characterized by an intellectual functioning significantly below the mean, with concomitant deficiencies or impairments in adaptive functioning developing before 18 years of age. It is encountered in 3% of the population. In early infancy, and the first five years of life in particular, the term developmental delay defines a clinical condition coinciding with a performance at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for chronological age in at least two of the following areas: global and fine motor control, language, cognition, personal/social, and activities of daily living, estimated to affect 5 to 10% of children. [2] The severity of ID can be classified on the basis of the intelligence quotient (IQ) that emerges on administering standardized tests. Values below 70 (i.e. 2 standard deviations below the mean) identify individuals suffering from ID, which can be distinguished as mild (IQ 50-70); moderate (IQ 30-49); severe (IQ 20-29); or profound (IQ <20). Cases of mild ID form the largest group, accounting for 85% of all cases of ID. Finally an assessment of behavioral phenotype is necessary as a clinical observation of child's behavior during natural interaction with parent or examiner, in a comfortable setting, in order to collect information about relation, communication, affective and motor modulation. In some cases it's possible to use also tests for specific aspects of behavior. [3] Actually, the double burden of malnutrition is characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition (stunting, wasting, vitamin and mineral deficiency) along with overweight, obesity or diet-related NCDs. To define the nutritional problem of a targeted population, it is necessary to measure its nutritional status. Nutritional status assessments enable to determine whether the individual is well nourished or undernourished. Nutritional status assessments of individuals make use of measurable criteria. These criteria reflect physical, physiological and biochemical changes as a result of inadequate food intake (quality and quantity) and diseases. Nutritional status can be assessed through anthropometric measurements, clinical examination and biochemical testing [1] . Among the evaluation measures, body mass index (BMI) is the most frequently used to characterize the nutritional status of young people and adults. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) developed cut-offs to classify the nutritional status based on BMI, considering age and sex [2, 3] . Different nutrition screening tools are available for use in children of different ages in different care settings [4] [5] [6] [7] . The classification of malnutrition risk of the assessed children by the different tools shows a substantial variation in the different tools [8] . Therefore, screening tool selection requires careful consideration of a wide range of issues, such as the purpose of the tool, its reliability and validity and practical issues associated with its implementation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 294, "end": 297, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 732, "end": 735, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1260, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1263, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1661, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1763, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2293, "end": 2296, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2757, "end": 2760, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3356, "end": 3359, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4707, "end": 4710, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5492, "end": 5495, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6263, "end": 6266, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6593, "end": 6596, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6597, "end": 6599, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6717, "end": 6720, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6721, "end": 6724, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6725, "end": 6728, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6729, "end": 6732, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6876, "end": 6879, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 102, "text": "Tanas", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A29"}, {"text": "One of the most accurate indexes to assess demographic wellbeing and quality of life of a population is neonatal mortality (defined as the number of deaths occurring in the first 28 days of life for every 1000 live births) and infant mortality (number of deaths occurring in the first year of life for every 1000 live births). In the last few years, there has been a significant decrease in infant mortality, even surpassing the rates recorded in the most developed Western countries, but neonatal and infant mortality have not decreased homogeneously. The most recent data from the Italian Statistic Bureau (ISTAT), referring to the 2015 census, show higher neonatal and infant mortality rates in the South compared to North and Central Regions. Neonatal mortality for every 1000 live births was: in Italy: 2.0; in North West: 1.8; in North Est: 1.5; in Centre: 2.0; in South: 2.3 and in Islands: 2.5. Infant mortality was in Italy: 2.6; in North West: 2.1; in North Est 2.0; in Centre: 2.2; in South: 3.3 and in Islands: 3.6. There are several reasons for this disparity: in addition to the wellknown differences in social and economic conditions, a decisive role is played by the inadequate organization of perinatal care. An additional kind of inequality at birth involves babies born to immigrant women. Today in Italy, the foreigners represent 8% of all Italian population. The same recent data from ISTAT referring to the 2015 census show higher neonatal (3.0 vs. 1.8/1000) and infant (4.5 vs 2.6/1000) mortality rates among foreign children living in Italy compared to Italian children (Italian residents). Among babies born to immigrant women, higher infant mortality was seen in children born to women coming from Central Africa (8.6 /1000). Social, economic, cultural disadvantages, heavier work conditions with scanty social security benefits, inadequate nutrition, poor hygienic living conditions, delayed and inadequate obstetric care of immigrant women during pregnancy, are all causes of the increase in morbidity and mortality risk in the newborn. There are also marked differences in infant health care among Italian regions, in terms of neonatal expanded screening, palliative care and health care of babies born to immigrants with irregular judicial status. There is therefore urgent need for a political and social plan focusing on infancy. The extraordinary discoveries of Genetics in recent decades have brought about radical consequences and changes not only in the medical field, whose scope is still to be fully assessed in their fullness, but also in the social and cultural sphere. The result is the feeling that \"genetic syndromes\" and rare diseases are in reality only current conditions, of the modern and contemporary world and closely related to our environmental context. This approach involves the belief that in the past they could not exist or anyway that a person with a genetic condition could not have the possibility of existence, survival or collocation (human / social / economic) in its context. If all this is true of some peculiar realities (such as Sparta in ancient Greece) or some historical phases in which ideological degenerations have prevailed (such as Nazism in Germany), careful analysis reveals and unveils an unexpected and spectacular world . In fact, the genetic conditions have always existed and have always accompanied man on his way since the beginning of humanity. The artists over the centuries have simply, rigorously and copiously, documented them. We also discover how different and multifaceted is the motivation of these representations that, depending on the circumstances, could be the simple \"photographic\" testimony of an objective fact, as a reporter or a reporter does; or it could be determined by the need to explain events on a religious or mythological basis, or to represent the \"whimsical\" touch of an artist; or the involuntary description of a morphological variant or finally the deliberate and intentional transfiguration of a morphological variant intended to convey a message, to make an allegory or to express an artistic genre. What is striking is that traces and testimonies of them can be found in all times, in all cultures and in all latitudes. Unexpectedly, we discover that the feeling that prevails is not of rejection or exclusion but very often of wonder and acceptance. Diabetic children and adolescents with satisfactory metabolic control have a similar rate of illness or infections as compared to healthy children. There are few reliable data about intercurrent illness in type 1 diabetes, and overall run in adulthood, but nearly all of them are in agreement with this statement. These patients may have altered immune function, increasing susceptibility to and delaying recovery from infections. Some papers describe also impairment in leukocyte function in young patients with poorly controlled diabetes. Patients and families should be provided with clear information on how to manage diabetes during intercurrent illnesses as well as to reach emergency medical personnel, overall diabetes team telephone contacts. Periodical recall of education on the topic should be done. The most dangerous complications to avoid are dehydration, hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, and ketoacidosis. Ongoing monitoring of blood glucose and of urine or blood ketones should be increased. The latter are to be preferred over urine ketones. Insulin should be never suspended also in the case of hypoglycaemia. Vomiting may be not only a sign of intercurrent illness but also of possible ketoacidosis. Fever usually causes hyperglycaemia requiring more insulin dose. In particular, when blood glucose is increased in absence or in presence of only small amount of ketones the total daily dose should be increased by 5-10% as short or subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin. If blood glucose is increased and moderate or large amount of ketones is detected suggesting a increased risk of ketoacidosis, the total daily dose should be increase by 10-20%. The increased need for insulin may persist for some days after recovery likely due to insulin resistance. On the other hand, illness associated with vomiting and diarrhoea may lower blood glucose increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Decreased food intake and poorer absorption with overt diarrhoea may contribute to hypoglycaemia. In this case, the insulin dose often needs to be decreased, but should not be lowered to the extent that ketones are produced. A specialist advice should be obtained when the illness is not clear or last-long, or vomiting and weight loss persist, or persistent hypoglycaemia becomes dangerous, or ketonuria or blood ketones are too high, or neurologic status changes. A special attention should be paid to younger children. Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is the systematic evaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health-care technology. It may address the direct and intended consequences of technologies as well as their indirect and unintended consequences. Its main purpose is to inform technology-related policy-making in health care. HTA is conducted by interdisciplinary groups using explicit analytical frameworks drawing from a variety of methods [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 7238, "end": 7241, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A29"}, {"text": "The first response to decision-makers' questions about the uncontrolled diffusion of costly medical equipment was provided by HTA, that began and developed its activities in the early 1970s [2] . Nowadays, the diffusion of HTA knowledge is being a usual part of healthcare services. it is an important tool that can support policy makers and managers working at different levels of health systems (micro, meso and macro) [3] . This process is made possible thanks to the contribution of professionals with different skills. They aim to analyze the main dimensions relative to innovative health technologies (from scientific and industrial research available on the market) that qualify their adoption (cf. effectiveness, safety, costs, ethical and organizational impact) in health facilities, by using the best available evidence [4] . It is necessary to estimate the needs for both health and healthcare assistance, to prioritize, to start evaluation processes and to promote the dissemination and the knowledge transfer. In this context, the role of the Italian Health Technology Assessment Society (SIHTA), founded in 2007 as a multidisciplinary and multi-professional scientific society, is crucial. Different stakeholders (people and organizations) involved in the evaluation of health technologies (central and regional institutions for the government of health, scientific societies, universities, industries, patients/citizens and their associations), are involved into the SIHTA (www.sihta.it). Its aim is to measure the value of the innovation effects on patients and on health care system. The main communication tools for the dissemination of HTA topic and knowledge, are the Italian annual meeting, health policy forum, training course, etc. Ensuring the high quality and robustness of evidences and divulged news are considered the principal purpose of the Italian Society.

Starting from 2007, the Emilia-Romagna region launched the \"Progetto Bambini e Antibiotici\" (ProBA project ) to improve appropriate antibiotic use in children: ProBA 1 lasted from 2007 to 2013, ProBA 2 from 2013 and is still ongoing. The project included the development of two regional guidelines for common paediatric infections: acute otitis media and sore throat. Guidelines were firstly published in 2007 and updated thereafter in 2015 [3, 4] . Main recommendations for sore throat treatment were: diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis using an algorithm based on Mc Isaac score and rapid diagnostic test (RAD) only for score 3 and 4; antibiotic treatment of RAD positive cases or score 5 children using 50 mg. amoxicillin in two daily doses for 6 days [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 389, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 833, "end": 836, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 837, "end": 839, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1154, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A29"}, {"text": "Other activities also included in the ProBA project were: public informative campaign on appropriate use of antibiotics, dissemination of evidence on common paediatric infections, periodical production and publication of regional reports on antibiotic prescription in primary paediatric care and, finally, individual reports of antibiotic prescriptions available for family paediatricians via website and via app for Android. [5] Temporal trends of two main indicators of appropriate antibiotic prescriptions based on European experience showed a statistically and clinically significant reduction in total antibiotic prescriptions in paediatric population (0-14 years old) and an increase in the ratio of amoxicillin to amoxicillin-clavulanate acid prescriptions (i.e. ratio of first choice to second choice antibiotics for most common paediatric respiratory infections), thus showing an impact of the ProBA project on appropriate antibiotic prescriptions [6, 7] [ Figure 1 ]. Traumatic experiences determine psychic reactions that are almost always proportional to the entity of the event suffered. What generally occurs, as an immediate response to the trauma, is the division of the affective dimension from the memory of the event. The pain linked to the traumatic experience would, in fact, be intolerable for the individual and therefore the psyche splits itself allowing access to memory only through the sensorial channel in the form of flash-backs that are repeated without allowing a complete memory of the event.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 426, "end": 429, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 961, "end": 963, "text": "7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 966, "end": 974, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "A29"}, {"text": "When the traumatic experience, as in the case of abuse, undermines trust in the relationship, it is possible that the defense mechanism of the split is deeper ten preventing any access to memory. Unlike traumatic events resulting from environmental factors, such as an earthquake, the abuse, as an act of violence perpetrated by a human being, activates more archaic and intense defenses, threatening the child's attachment style and general functioning. In these cases the impact of the traumatic experience can determine important regressions and favor inhibitions of the energy available for growth, triggering behavioral disorders and / or cognitive organization. The traumatic event of abuse can also reactivate previous experiences of inadequate care, thus determining a more complex psychopathological picture that must be seen as a cumulative effect of previous distortions and current responses. Post-traumatic stress disorder therefore requires special attention in childhood for all the components of development and the environmental dynamics that have accompanied the development of the child, especially if the abuse involves important reference figures within the family unit or school environment. It often happens that behavioral problems or delays cover unprocessed levels of distress due to the removal of traumas. It is necessary a great competence, as well as a total ability to listen, to frame the origin of the difficulties of the child and go back, sometimes, to traumatic conditions not yet highlighted by the environment. The elaboration of a trauma such as abuse requires a specific path that allows the reintegration of affective contents to the sensory ones and a reconnection of warm and cold memories to resume the thread of one's autobiographical narrative. Within a psychotherapeutic process, which considers the integration of these aspects central, can also be useful trauma-specific interventions that also use the body dimension for the reconstruction of the story but always within a significant relationship that can give meaning to the events remembered.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A29"}, {"text": "The Progressive changes in heart anatomy and physiology, taking place between birth and adolescence, result in differences between the normal adult pattern and paediatric ECG [1] .

In general, it is defined bradycardia, at rest or awake, a heart rate <100 bpm in children up to 3 years old, < 60 bpm in patients 3-9 years old, <50 bpm in patients 9-16 years old and < 40 bpm for patients older than 16 years. Tachycardia is defined as a sequence of three or more beats at a rate >25% of the sinus rate at the onset of the arrhythmia (usually 120 bpm). Supraventricular extrabeat: generally idiopathic and clinically silent, it usually disappears during the first year of life; no treatment needed. Ventricular extrabeat: usually idiopathic, with no symptoms. A structural cardiopathy or more complex arrhythmias must be excluded; in general, they disappear spontaneously. Paroxystic supraventricular reentry tachycardia (SVT): the most common arrhythmia in children (82%). Often, preschool children can describe palpitations as \"precordial pain\". Main reentry tachyarrhythmias are: SVTs due to accessory pathways: atrioventricular re-entry tachycardias (AVRT). A particular type of AVRT is the permanent junctional re-entry tachycardia (PJRT); Re-entry in the AV node: atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT). It is rather rare in paediatric age (13-16% of all SVTs). Nowadays, very safe and effective ablation techniques exist for its treatment (such as cryoablation with 3D mapping system guide) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Ventricular tachycardias (VTs): rare in paediatric age (5-10% of all tachyarrhythmias). They can be idiopathic or expression of a structural heart disease, a cardiomyopathy, a myocarditis, cardiac tumours, electrolytes disorders, channelopaties. Secondary forms are more frequent than idiopathic ones. Atrioventricular block (AVB): first degree AV block is characterized by a prolongation of the AV conduction. Second degree AV block Mobitz 1 consists in a progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a P wave is not followed by a QRS. Second degree AV block Mobitz 2 is an intermittent and sudden block in the AV conduction. In third degree AV block there is a complete interruption of the AV conduction and pacemaker implant can be necessary [12] [13] [14] [15] . Third degree AVB can be isolated, usually congenital, or associated to congenital heart disease. In 70-80% of congenital isolated AV block, maternal autoantibodies are present [16] [17] . Puberty is the results of reactivation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. The beginning of puberty involves a shift from a predominantly inhibitory to an excitatory control which results in diurnal activation of pulsatile GnRH release leading to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility, the first endocrine manifestation of puberty. The change in pulsatile GnRH release results from activation of excitatory networks operating in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, with kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons playing a central role [1] . The timing of puberty varies significantly in the general population and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors [2, 3] . Data from studies within ethnic groups, and between monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins suggest that 50-80% of the variation in pubertal timing is determined by genetic factors [4, 5] . There is also strong evidence of environmental effects on the timing of puberty, as well as of secular trends [7, 8] . A marked trend towards an earlier age at menarche has been observed over the last 150 years [9] . In many countries the age at menarche has been progressively decreasing at a consistent rate of around 3 years for every hundred years (3.6 months/decade) [9] . European data from the last 50 years have shown variable rates of earlier age at menarche, with both faster and slower rates. This heterogeneity is related to social class, income, urban versus rural background, education and family size [3] . Furthermore, nutritional changes play an important role as reflected by positive correlations between age at puberty onset or age at menarche and body mass index [10] . The effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) on pubertal timing have been addressed in a number of studies which indicated that pubertal timing can be affected through exposure during different periods of life. The resulting changes depend on the EDC, the period of exposure and the endpoint chosen for evaluation of puberty [11] . Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms seem to play a significant role in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive axis through a switch from transcriptional inhibition to transcriptional activation [1] . The timing of puberty has been also associated with various adult diseases and linked to the potential development of depression and anxiety, eating disorders, risky sexual activity, and aggressive and antisocial behavior at an early age [12] [13] [14] . Family-based and peer-focused preventive interventions may improve parent-child relationships, communication about puberty, and foster healthier peer interactions. 14 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 68, "end": 71, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 72, "end": 75, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1410, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1414, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1418, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1422, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1426, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1430, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1435, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1440, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2193, "end": 2197, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2202, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2212, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2395, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2400, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 2976, "end": 2979, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3111, "end": 3114, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3117, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3301, "end": 3304, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3305, "end": 3307, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3420, "end": 3423, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3426, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3521, "end": 3524, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3682, "end": 3685, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3926, "end": 3929, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4094, "end": 4098, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4433, "end": 4437, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4640, "end": 4643, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4884, "end": 4888, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4889, "end": 4893, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4894, "end": 4898, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5065, "end": 5067, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A38"}, {"text": "Children living in residential child care, like foster care, have still serious deficiencies in their overall health and wellbeing, particularly in emotional health and behavior and vaccine coverage.

The benefits of a well-planned transition include improvements in clinical, educational and social outcomes for young people. Transition clinics should begin by 12 years of age, with age-appropriate information, discussion and objectives. The staged approach should allow the patient to feel secure with their new medical team before full transfer to adult services around 16-18 years of age. When successful it should empower them to take control of their own health and provides a platform for optimal disease management throughout their adult life [3] . A poor transition risks alienating young adults from healthcare providers with subsequent poor compliance, loss to follow-up and substandard medical care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 581, "end": 584, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1614, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and Conclusion"}, {"text": "Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are common (about 30% of the malformations) [1] and severe (the main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the pediatric age) and a predisposing factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease [2] .The acronym CAKUT includes a heterogeneous spectrum of pathologies: from simple, asymptomatic morphological variations, to serious diseases, which put the patient's life at risk.

Unfortunately, the epidemiological study showed that precocity of diagnosis and therapeutic aggression did not modify the outcome of CAKUT [3] , because their natural history varies only slightly by solving the hydraulic problems of obstruction or reflux. For this reason, research has shifted its attention to genetic and molecular origin of CAKUT [4] [5] . And because of this, clinicians should plan a diagnostic program commensurate to the expected benefit: minimizing radiobiological risk, patient discomfort and economic burden. In this context, a large space must be reserved for US, which allows for a detailed evaluation of number, shape, position, volume and structure of the kidneys; for many CAKUT, US may be the only necessary for diagnosis and also for follow-up. It is the US responsibility to distinguish the clinical situations of low and medium risk from those in which other diagnostic techniques are indicated. The main limitation of US is that the result is closely related to the skill and experience of the operator, therefore maximum effort should be made to guarantee quality of the performance for all patients, through accreditation systems for sonographers, and to offer to pediatricians, who practice US, adequate training [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 468, "end": 471, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 678, "end": 681, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1584, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and Conclusion"}, {"text": "Other imaging techniques play a much more limited role in diagnosing CAKUT: voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), is often supplanted by US even in the morphological study of urethra and anatomical details of bladder, its only indication remains the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Cystosonography or cystoscintigraphy [7] [8] are always valid alternatives to VCUG and respectively they cancel and limit the radiobiological risk. When US shows a severe dilatation and an obstruction is suspected, the diagnosis of the CAKUT can be completed by sequential renal scintigraphy (with MAG 3 or DTPA) which supplies the functional data of each kidney and, completed with the diuretic test, provides the differential diagnosis between dilatation and obstruction [9] . DMSA scintigraphy will be used if it is necessary to \"visualize\" and \"quantify\" the functioning renal parenchyma or to evaluate the function in percentage terms. A role limited to complex and rare situations is reserved for Uro-RM or TC. Despite medical progress in diagnostics and therapeutics, sepsis remains a major cause of mortality and hospitalization in the pediatric age, both in developed and developing countries [1, 2] . Sepsis may be defined as a systemic inflammatory syndrome determined by an underlying infectious process [3] . Septic shock is the progression toward a state of inadequate delivery of oxygen and metabolic substrate to tissues. Early identification and appropriate treatment of sepsis is crucial for a positive outcome [4] . In such setting, biomarkers whose levels significantly change in response to an infectious insult may serve as an helpful tool for screening and diagnosis of sepsis/severe infections, risk stratification, monitoring of response and rationalizing antibiotic use. A panel at the National Institute of Health defined a biomarker as any \"characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention\" [5] . In clinical practice, the term \"biomarker\" is generally referred to a test performed on body fluids that easily provides information about the patients on a specific situation or process (such as serious infection or sepsis). Acute phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein, have been largely studied, whereas data on the performance of newer biomarkers of sepsis are relatively scarce in children. Creactive protein is an easily available low-cost test, but is hampered by a low accuracy for distinguishing infection from inflammation and a long latency after the inflammatory trigger. Procalcitonin peaks earlier and has higher specificity for bacterial infections than Creactive protein, but has also higher costs and its levels may be affected by renal dysfunction. Slow Medicine is a transcultural movement inside the larger international \"slow \" culture, comprehending Slow Food, Slow Cities, also \"Slow Music\". As well as Slow Food (Good, Clean and Fair Food) our mean key words are \"Measured \"-doing more does not mean doing better -\"Respectful\" -people's values expectations desires are different and inviolable, \"Equitable \"-appropriate and good quality care for all-. Slow Medicine promotes a change of the current paradigm of medicine from mechanical to a complex systemic view. We think that a quality care needs the integration of new visions, knowledge, behaviour, relation, integrity, and reduce the influence of market forces over health care organisations, clinics and care. Slow medicine promotes: better lifestyles, better workplaces, better food and water, better relations inside the community, better relations between human communities and environment; better clinical independent patient outcomes oriented research, without conflict of interests; evidence based medicine: the best literature, the best knowledge of patient's values and wishes and the best medical experience; better patient care, less \"cure\", promote an alliance between citizens and institutions, between patients and doctors, nurses and midwives (not just providers but healers); choosing wisely the right care only if necessary, fair and appropriate; Recognise the Disease Mongering in its features, pushers, corruption, side effects; promote health: a person is not just his/her disease but it's a complex living system with many healthy parts and potentials that can help his/her healing even if he/she is very ill; mutual knowledge between patient and doctor: every healing relationship cannot be good without an initial introduction of doctors/nurses/midwives with their patients : \"Hallo, my name is..\"; all of this needs a Slow Management, a Slow Organisation. A basic international activity of Slow Medicine is the alliance with the Choosing Wisely movement. In 5 years we involved 45 medical and nursing scientific societies, to choose each one 5 possibly inappropriate medical and nursing practices to be discussed with patients before prescribing them. This happens with the participation of the Federations of Medical and Nursing Colleges, Altroconsumo and Mario Negri's Institute \"Partecipasalute\" project . The practices have been inserted into the new national guidelines plan of the National Health Institute and in the EBSCO worldwide documentation system. We also collaborate with some regions, hospitals and health units in the project \" Slow Hospitals and health units\" to promote our principles and practices at local level. An illustration of the main inappropriate paediatric practices choosen by the paediatric societies will follow. in Europe, representing a major burden for developed countries. The incidence and prevalence of childhood-onset IBD has risen rapidly over the past two decades. While previously considered rare in children, IBD has emerged as a global disease in developed and developing nations. A clear north-south and west-east gradient exists in incidence of pediatric IBD in northern hemisphere, higher for example in the northern state of the US than southern and in Scotland than the rest of the UK. The increasingly early onset of CD and UC raises important questions regarding the role of early-life factors in the pathogenesis of IBD (mode of delivery, breastfeeding, antibiotics therapies, smoking, etc..). These same factors can explain the observation that children of immigrants assumed the IBD risk of incidence of the hosting Country, indicating that the underlying risk is activated with earlier life exposure to \"west environment\".", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 329, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 330, "end": 333, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 762, "end": 765, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1194, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1197, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1308, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1521, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2047, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and Conclusion"}, {"text": "Based on clinical criteria, major malformations are defined as defects causing functional impairment and therefore needing medical or surgical treatment. Defects that do not produce functional impairment and do not require medical intervention are termed minor malformations if their prevalence at birth is less than 4% and phenotypic variants when the birth prevalence is higher. Major and/or minor congenital malformations are frequently associated; apparently isolated defects may be associated with malformations that are not clinically evident at birth [1] . Therefore, most minor malformations may be isolated and should not generate any specific alert for future health issues, others may be part of a more complex phenotype with a more severe prognosis, these must be recognized early and investigated carefully. The birth of a baby with congenital malformations is the starting point of a clinical process that is aimed at making a precise diagnosis. This leads to appropriate clinical planning and definition of prognosis and counselling of the parents [2] . Different causal pathways may lead to a similar phenotype and the diagnostic process may be long and difficult, requiring follow-up to establish the natural history of the disorder. The diagnostic process includes an accurate history, description of the phenotype, with appropriate imaging and laboratory tests [3] . Improvements in informatics have led to the development of computerized systems to improve diagnostic accuracy. The history should include consideration of the whole family (with the definition of a genealogical tree and the identification of risk factors (consanguinity, multiple abortions, stillbirths, advanced maternal and/or paternal age), the preconceptional period and environmental factors (infections, maternal metabolic diseases, diabetes mellitus, drugs, alcohol) and the pregnancy [4] . Analysis of the phenotype [5] is aimed at the identification and description (with photographic documentation) of structural defects (isolated and multiple, major and minor) and should include a description of clinical associations with genetic syndromes, such as neuropsychomotor retardation, growth restriction [6] , disorders of sexual differentiation or pubertal development. Genetic counselling is defined as the non-directive process of communicating with and giving information to a family (usually the parents) to enable the making of decisions relating to patients with genetic diseases that are considered, responsible and rational. The main factors that determine a need for genetic counselling are the presence of an index case with a congenital malformation or of genetic disease in the family as well as the presence of parental risk factors (consanguinity, advanced maternal age, recurrent abortions, mutation carrier). The rationale for routine HPV immunization at 11 through 12 years of age is twofold. First, optimal vaccine efficacy is derived if the vaccine is administered before onset of sexual activity. Second, antibody responses are highest at ages 9 through 15 years. Immunization of males provides direct benefit to males, including prevention of genital warts and anal cancer. In addition, immunization of males is expected to provide indirect benefit for females through herd immunity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 558, "end": 561, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1066, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1383, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1882, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1914, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2201, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and Conclusion"}, {"text": "Since 2015 in Italy it is available a new nine-valent vaccine for prevention of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, which are responsible for 89% of cases of HPV-related cancers and more than 90% of genital warts and almost all cases of juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The National Vaccination Prevention Plan 2017-2019 recommends the free-of-charge and active immunization against HPV for all males and females 11-through 12-year-old children as part of the adolescent immunization platform. [3] Practices on vaccine efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness as well as programmatic considerations supports this recommendation. [2, 4] The vaccine is offered in 2 doses to healthy 12 years old adolescents. The first dose is given at any time. The second dose is given 6 to 12 months after the first dose. The vaccine is also given in 3 doses to adolescents > 15 years of age. The first dose is given at any time. The second dose is given 1 to 2 months after the first dose. The third dose is given 6 months after the first dose. [5] The HPV 9-valent vaccine represents the new standard for the largest and universal prevention of HPV-related pathologies. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic viral hepatitis in children. Before 1992, when the universal screening of blood products began, hepatitis C was spread commonly through transfusions and organ transplants [1] . Nowadays, worldwide, children can acquire the infection from mothers with hepatitis C or through the use of blood-contaminated objects (syringes and other equipment). Transmission from mother to child is the major source of acquisition of HCV infection in children [1, 2] . The exact timing and the ultimate mechanism of mother-to-child transmission of HCV infection are unknown. Understanding the mechanism of motherto-child transmission is an unsolved challenge. Following mother-to-child transmission of HCV about 20% of the children present spontaneous clearance of the infection while the remaining develop chronic hepatitis and, if untreated, will become HCV infected adults [3] . Interferon-based therapies, which have a low efficacy and a burdensome safety profile [4] , have been substituted since 2014 with the highly effective and safe new combinations of direct-acting antivirals active against HCV. Recently, in July 2017, the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and the combination of sofosbuvir with ribavirin have been approved by the European Medicines Agency for treatment of children older than 12 years with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 and 2 or 3 infection, respectively. Preliminary results on the use of direct-acting antivirals in children are available for sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in children aged 6-17, for sofosbuvir and ribavirin for children older than 12 years, for the combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir, with or without ribavirin for children older than 12 years with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 4 infection, and for the combination of sofosbuvir with daclatasvir for children with hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection [5] . All the results available showed excellent efficacy and optimal safety profiles of the different combinations of direct-acting antivirals. With the approval of the new drugs, indications to treatment of children with chronic hepatitis C virus have changed. Nowadays, direct-acting antiviral therapy is recommended for all the adolescents with chronic hepatitis C virus infection independent of treatment history and disease severity. As soon as directacting antivirals will be approved for younger age cohorts, all hepatitis C virus-infected children older than three years will benefit from antiviral therapy [6] . The goal of elimination of HCV infection as a public health threat requires inclusion of all affected populations, including children. . Among migrant students it has been reported school difficulties due to the late and inadequate learning of Italian language, recent migration and psycho-social-cultural disadvantage (32.9% in foreign students versus 10,5% in Italian students). But also, recently, it has been registered an increasing number of migrant students with disabilities (12%). Therefore, adequate education policies are needed, including promotion of early language learning and educational activities, as well as training for teachers in issues related to migration and the presence of cultural mediators in schools. Nowadays, Italy guarantees free foreign children's access to pediatric health services as well as their National Healthcare System registration, independently from legal status of their parents. Nevertheless, informal barriers, in turn added to health policies, hinder access: language and intercultural communication problems, lack of social network and of knowledge about the health care system, as well as lack of cultural mediators in most primary paediatric health centers [2] . At least, international adoption presents unique challenges that require support for the adoptive families throughout all the adoption process, because of a growing number of international adoptions involve kids who are older and have special needs, and in order to avoid adoption crises or \"failures\". Greater understanding of the elevated risk posed by migration to disabled migrant children is needed along with strategies to mitigate risks. The particular vulnerability of migrant minors due to social fragility and inadequate reception, impose multidisciplinary and transcultural approach [3] , increasingly widespread. Delivering healthcare is a collective activity to increase public awareness and combine efforts of disabled people, their families and communities, as well as relevant governmental agencies and NGOs, educational and social services, within a framework where social inclusion, equal opportunities, and, as a consequence, a good quality of life of disabled people prevails. Nasal cytology is a simple and safe method that allows to evaluate the possible inflammatory state of the nasal mucosa. From a technical point of view it consists of a delicate passage with a tool (nasal scraping) on the mucosa of the inferior turbinate, the deposition of the material on a slide and the subsequent coloring with May Grumwald Giemsa. The preparation will then be read with a 100 X microscope according to a semiquantitative and descriptive reading (table I) . (1) The reading allows to distinguish the cells of the nasal mucosa and the inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells) as well as the presence of fungi and bacteria. This diagnostic therefore becomes important as a diagnostic tool in allergic forms with minimal persistent inflammation, typical of mites, (2) or in the differential diagnosis of overlapping rhinitis (allergic and Nares) (3) and in the diagnosis of non-allergic forms such as Nares, Naresma or Narma, (Fig 1,2,3) in which the diagnosis can not be a simple exclusion of allergic sensitization but must be circumstantiated with the presence of eosinophils or mast cells. Nasal cytology therefore becomes an important tool for precision medicine (4) thus allowing targeted therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 652, "end": 655, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 656, "end": 658, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1056, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1407, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1678, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1681, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2094, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2183, "end": 2186, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3136, "end": 3139, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3752, "end": 3755, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4967, "end": 4970, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5567, "end": 5570, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 6435, "end": 6444, "text": "(table I)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6932, "end": 6943, "text": "(Fig 1,2,3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "HPV vaccine"}, {"text": "Immunogenicity Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy in childhood, affecting 2-7 % of children [1] . The mainstay of treatment of CMA is strict avoidance of cow's milk proteins. Breastfeeding, if still possible, is the first choice for CMA patients. In the absence of breast milk, international guidelines recommend the prescription of a substitute formula until at least 2 years of age, in order to fulfill the nutritional requirements of young children [1] . This type of formulas should be adequate in terms of allergic efficacy and nutritional safety. Substitute formulas include extensively hydrolyzed formulas (EHF) based on caseins or whey proteins, amino acid formulas (AAF), and non-cow's milk-based formulas based on soy and rice proteins [2] . As the allergic condition may expose the infant with CMA to early growth impairments, the macronutrient composition of substitute formulas should reasonably be taken into account. The current literature supports the nutritional adequacy of available cow's milk substitutes both during the first and second semesters of life, with some differences between products [1] . With particular reference to protein hydrolysates, some studies also demonstrated a hypoallergenic immunomodulating effect, favoring the induction of tolerance towards cow's milk proteins [3] . Therefore, an ideal substitute formula for CMA should be well tolerated, lead to remission of allergic symptoms, and allow proper and even catch-up growth of the affected children. In a growing child a normal growth pattern usually indicates absence of chronic disease. Thus, regular measurement of weight and height is of paramount importance in daily pediatrics care. Height and weight need to be measured at least every year in school-aged healthy children, and more frequently in newborns and toddlers. Appropriate growth charts help the paediatricians in the evaluation of normal or abnormal growth. Therefore, it is essential to know how to interpret the growth curve and recognize when the growth pattern is abnormal. Besides weight and height measurements, other parameters like height velocity, target height, pubertal status, body mass index (BMI), and body proportions need to be considered. The anthropometric measurements should be as accurate as possible, best done with the same instrument at each visit, in order to avoid wrong interpretations of the results. Short stature, under or overweight, and abnormal body proportions are the most common growth abnormalities found in the general pediatric setting. Short stature is defined as height <2 standard deviations from mean height of healthy children from the same population. Short stature can be associated with growth failure. Deceleration of growth even in a normal statured child is always an alarm signal, and the child needs to be promptly investigated. Short stature can be due to a variety of conditions and in every short child first line blood testing and bone age assessment are warranted. National guidelines indicate the criteria to perform growth hormone secretion studies. Idiopathic short stature (familial) and constitutional delay of growth and puberty are the most common causes of short stature, but in most children pathological causes need to be excluded.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 117, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1141, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1335, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A54"}, {"text": "Overweight and obesity are a major health problem also in children, due to the high frequency and the high rate of complications and comorbidities.

An older child is defined overweight when BMI is \u226585 th percentile, and obese if BMI is \u226595 th percentile. Obese children need to be screened for possible comorbidities (dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose tolerance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Obesity is seldom caused by an endocrine disorder (Cushing disease, hyoithyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, genetic syndromes). Endocrine investigation should be reserved to selected cases. Since weight loss in the obese child is a difficult task, early identification of overweight children is of primary importance to prevent obesity and its complications. Life expectancy is now longer than ever before. In Italy, it is now 80.6 years for men and 84.9 years for women (Istat, 2017). However, while public health policies and interventions have led to the almost total eradication of most acute diseases, chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and degenerative conditions are on the rise, due in part to factors such as unhealthy lifestyle and unfavourable environmental conditions. In conventional medicine, chronic diseases are essentially treated by controlling their symptoms, with the aim of ensuring the patient's quality of life.

This disease, later named \"old BPD\", was histopathologically characterized by intense airway inflammation, heterogeneous lung injury, and parenchymal fibrosis [2] . Since its first description, the definition of BPD has undergone several revisions. Currently, BPD is most often defined using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consensus criteria based upon oxygen requirement (\u226528 days), gestational age (<32 weeks vs \u226532 weeks) and severity (mild, moderate, severe) depending on oxygen use and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks postmenstrual age or at 56 days of postnatal age [3] . Nevertheless, efforts are being made to refine this definition [4] . Many advances in neonatal-perinatal medicine (prenatal steroids, surfactant replacement, and gentler ventilation strategies), shifted the demographic characteristics of BPD to extremely preterm infants, born with structurally immature lungs and underdeveloped pulmonary vasculature [5] . The early disruption of normal lung development by preterm birth would evolve into aberrations in both alveolarization and pulmonary vasculogenesis. These abnormalities have defined the concept of \"new BPD\" which is histopathologically characterized by simplification of the parenchyma and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature [6] [7] [8] [9] .

For many pathogens, peripheral colonization usually precedes systemic infection, however many episodes of sepsis are actually caused by a breakthrough, pathogenic microorganism. Sepsis in neonates, especially when preterms, are associated with cytokine -and biomediator-induced disorders of respiratory, hemodynamic, and metabolic processes. Neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit feature many specific risk factors for bacterial and fungal sepsis. Prematurity is the most important risk factor, since the incidence rates of sepsis are linearly associated with decreased gestational age and birth weight. In addition, loss of gut commensals such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli spp, as occurs with prolonged antibiotic treatments, delayed enteral feeding, or nursing in incubators, translates into proliferation of pathogenic microflora and abnormal gut colonization.

These two factors often determine an overuse of antibiotics (either in number of infants exposed, or in duration of exposure in single patients). This overuse is associated with a number of potential adverse outcomes, such as selection of multidrugresistant organisms, invasive candidiasis, necrotising enterocolitis, increased costs, modification and disruption of the normal development of the gut microbiota potentially impacting on late gut health and immunity. A wide range of measures can be implemented in order to prevent overuse of antibiotics nonetheless preventing neonatal infections. Improvement in diagnostic skills is mandatory, and this goal can be pursued by implementing the use of novel diagnostic methodologies like the heart -rate frequency characteristics, and the gradient in central vs. peripheral body temperature. Withdrawal of unnecessary exposure when empirical use has been performed is equally advisable, meaning that antibiotics may be suspended if the infection is not clinically and microbiologically confirmed after 48-72 hrs. Shorter courses may be also envisaged when infection is confirmed. A wide range of preventative measures can be implemeneted, since overuse of antibiotics may obviously be limited by preventing infections. Promotion of breast-feeding andmore generallynutritional and feeding strategies enhancing the role of human fresh milk are of utmost importance. Hygiene measures are a key step, as the greatest proportion of infections in neonates are acquired nosocomially. Adoption of a cautious central venous catheter policy, including DVC bundles, is critical to decrease the frequency of catheter-associated infections (CLABSI). Enhancement of the enteric microbiota composition with the supplementation of probiotics, medical stewardship concerning H2blockers with restriction of their use, all of this translates into a better chance for the neonate host to develop a competent enteric microbiota thus enhancing some defensive mechanisms at gut level. Use of drugs or bioactive substances in prevention is also important, and its usefulness has been consistently underlined in the last decade.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, peripheral artery disease represent the main cause of mortality in developed Countries [1] . Several epidemiologic studies have proved that family history of CVD, age, gender, perinatal factors, overweight, tobacco exposure, hypertension, dyslipidemia represent risk factors for development of CVD [2] . Vascular lesions that produce CVD may be detected by laboratory investigations (e.g. hypercholesterolemia, microalbuminuria, etc.) or instrumental investigations (e.g. pulse wave velocity, wall thickness, myocardial ultrasound, etc.). Vascular lesions have also been found in children and have been related to some risk factors [3] . Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic renal failure, obesity in adults are clearly associated with CVD [4] and children affected by these disease develop CVD earlier than adults. Furthermore, new chronic diseases in children have been associated with the risk to develop CVD such as : Endocrine diseases (Hyperthyroidism, Cushing disease, Hyperaldosteronism, Hyperpatathyroidism); Cardiovascular diseases (Kavasaky disease, cardiac valvular diseases, large artery malformations); Metabolic diseases ( hyperomocisteinemia, glycogenosis); Neoplastic diseases (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma); Autoinflammatory diseases (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis); Organ Transplantations; Migrane; Psycosis [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Several mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the vascular damage in those diseases including genetic background, physical inactivity, wrong diet, chronic inflammation, and drugs.

They are usually treated with observation and parental reassurance. However, a number of cases are related to pathologic entities due to both focal and systemic processes. There is great controversy about the role that flat feet play in health, and disagreement on the indications for treatment. In asymptomatic flexible flat feet, the use of orthotics is generally over-rated and incorrect information is easily found online by parents.

The clinical picture, approach and outcome can vary widely depending on the site (low or high urinary tract), on associated morphological abnormalities of the kidney or of the urinary tract, on whether the patient is a newborn or a child, on whether the patient also suffers from a dysfunctional bladder, and on whether the patient is immunosuppressed or not. As a result, antibiotic treatment or need for prophylaxis depend on all the above-mentioned factors. Different guidelines on urinary tract infections in children have been published (National Institute of Clinical Excellence -NICE, American Academy of Pediatrics and the Italian guidelines on urinary tract infections). A European survey performed in 10 different countries showed that compliance with these guidelines is very limited. This talk aims to review the literature, discuss the epidemiology of UTIs in children, antibiotic treatment and the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing UTI-related renal scarring, and, finally, to provide some basic advice on evidence-based management of UTIs in children (treatment, prophylaxis, route of administration). Other aspects discussed include the main risk factors for antibiotic resistance in E. Coli (the germ most commonly involved in UTIs in children), and its implications for healthcare costs. In conclusion, even though a gold standard for the treatment of UTIs is not yet available, we now can manage UTIs to the best of our current knowledge. The number of new genetic disorders with a molecular characterization is significantly growing. The poor specificity of clinical presentation and the difficulty obtaining appropriate biological samples are the peculiar diagnostic challenges of genetic disorders with neonatal onset. The rapid development of next generation sequencing (NGS) is leading to considerable diagnostic progress. The application of NGS technology could have a key role in complex diagnosis issues since it potentially avoids ineffective treatments, justifies targeted therapy, limits complications with an overall reduction in hospitalisation and costs [1] . However, it raises several ethical issues related to incidental findings frequently associated with pathologies with adult onset or carrier status; identification of genetic variants of uncertain significance; privacy data protection [2, 3] . Some countries already have a universal consensus about whether to reveal or not the incidental findings to the family. In Italy the patient or their tutor instead has the utmost discretion in this decision. Both options have limits. A complete and comprehensive informed consent on which genetic variants should be disclosed, could be a solution. In the most restrictive case, only those variants of immediate and crucial implication in therapy and management of the patient and their family would be notified. Therefore, the variants of uncertain significance, the predisposition to adult pathology or the carrier status would not be revealed to the patient or recorded in their medical records. However, the involvement of an independent ethical committee would be recommended in extraordinary cases. Furthermore, privacy and data protection implies an investment in the technologies for the anonymization and encrypting of all data. The Italian Societies of Neonatology, Pediatrics, Human Genetics and Genetic Pediatric Diseases and Disability have issued an intersociety policy statement to define specific guidelines for the application of NGS technology in neonatal medicine. They suggest its use in critically ill newborns with an undefined clinical presentation compatible with a monogenic or genetically heterogeneous disease [4] . In these cases, an accurate genetic diagnosis is of utmost importance, since it indicates the appropriate surveillance and monitoring program, it predicts long-term complications, it provides the rationale for a targeted therapy and analyses the recurrence risk in prospective future reproduction choices. The application of NGS technology avoids numerous invasive, nonspecific and inconclusive tests and prevents possible complications caused by diagnostic delays. Moreover, the early diagnosis of a disease with a poor prognosis could significantly impact the decision process and management of the patient.

(Table 1) In a Lazio pediatric hospital were enrolled infants admitted for VRS bronchiolitis during the last 3 seasons. In 2015/2016, 152 patients were collected, 137 (90,1%) RSV type A positive: 65 (42,7%) developed acute respiratory distress (ARDS), 65 (42,7%) were treated with oxygen, 6 (9,2%) with HFNC and 3 (4,6%) were transferred into a pediatric intensive unit. In 2016/2017 season 101 patients were hospitalized for bronchiolitis. The distribution of Respiratory Syncytial virus changed, in fact 37 (36,6%) were positive for RSV type A, 63 for RSV type B (62,3%) and 1 for RSV type A+B (0,9%). Furthermore 52 children (51,4%) developed ARDS, 52 (51,4%) were treated with oxygen, 17 (32,6%) with HFNC and 9 (17,3%) were transferred into a pediatric intensive unit (PICU).

Infants have high nutritional needs for growth and development, with a lot of evidences supporting the importance of early life nutrition on long-term health outcomes: protein intakes in children from 1 to 3 years of age are excessive, while vitamin D, iron, \u03c9-3 PUFA and iodine are below requirements. Cow's milk is commonly consumed among infants, contributing the highest percentage of energy intake; it is a rich source of Calcium, protein and fats, but it is low in certain micronutrients important for growth and development, such as Fe, vitamin D (8, 9) and \u03c9 -3 essential fatty acids; however an excessive consumption of cow's milk may cause a high protein intake. The WHO suggests using fortified foods when children are not achieving adequate nutrient intake from their diet [1] . Young child formulae (YCF), term who included Toddler's milk, growing up milk or formula for young children, are milk-based drinks or plant protein-based formulae intended to partially satisfy the nutritional requirements of young children aged 1 to 3 years, in detail for Fe, vitamin D and \u03c9-3 essential fatty acids.

Fortified milk had minimal effects on weight gain compared with control milk. The risk of anaemia was reduced in fortified milk groups compared with control groups. There were no significant effects on height gain, changes in body composition or Hb concentration [4] . In recent years, the intake of plant-based beverages (PBBs) in the first years of life has increased. The main reasons for this change are preference for plant foods, aversion to the use of cow's milk, and prevention or treatment of cow's milk allergy, as part of strict vegetarian diets or as a consequence of the advice of alternative medicine practitioners. In the first years of life the exclusive consumption of mainly soy, rice, almond or oat PBBs results in nutritional risks [5] . Based on available evidence, YCF can be used as part of a healthy diet for children aged 1 to 3 years. The natural history of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is characterized by recurrent episodes of respiratory infection causing a progressive pulmonary damage, with decay of long-term lung function leading to death. In CF patients, spirometry shows a 2% reduction every year of Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) over time. In case of pulmonary infection, an early antibiotic treatment helps to prevent more serious complications, limiting consequently the long-term pulmonary damage. Since 2001, in CF Centre of the Pediatric Hospital Bambino Ges\u00f9 in Rome, we used Telemedicine (TM) to facilitate the home follow-up of patients. Fev1 was monitored at home, in the aim to early recognize pulmonary relapses. The project has involved 78 patients affected by CF, followed at our Unit with telehomecare (THC) in addition to the usual therapeutic protocol, for a period of 15 years. The balance of enrolment showed a drop-out of 33%, the main cause was poor adherence (65%). We used various and different equipment in this period, also following the progress of technology in this field. To investigate the possible role of THC in follow-up of CF at home, we monitored the activities of THC treated patients from 2011 to 2014 toward a similar control group. The design of the study was case control -open label trial. THC was applied in addition to the standard therapeutic protocol. The endpoint was the annual mean Fev1 over time. We found that THC patients improved their FEV1 values with a significantly better trend than the one reported in the control group. Later, we extended the observational period, by monitoring the activities of same patients until 2016. Our results showed once more that THC treated patients improved their FEV1 values with a trend significantly better than the one reported by controls. The possible meaning of the results is discussed. We conclude that the application of telemonitoring in CF, while not able to treat the disease radically, could reduce, through a better identification of relapses, the lung damage secondary to respiratory exacerbations, allowing a better respiratory stability and therefore a better quality of life. Background Vaccination has strikingly reduced morbidity and mortality due to childhood infectious diseases in developed countries and also protected infants too young to be vaccinated. Nevertheless, parents may be still hesitant to get their children vaccinated due to lack of knowledge of the seriousness of the disease, skepticism about vaccination benefits, and fear of adverse events following immunization. Declining vaccination rates could facilitate the spread of illness and death from vaccine preventable diseases and could increase costs for society, both as direct health care costs and indirectly through lost productivity.

This is probably due to multiple factors, among which an increasingly worrying environmental and atmospheric pollution stand out as they favor an early exposure of children to various types of allergens, with the consequent sensitization of their airways. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a public health problem that affects adults, adolescents, and children. Epidemiological studies indicated that in developed and industrialized countries the prevalence of AR increased progressively over the last three decades. AR currently affects up to 40% of the world population, with prevalence variations between adults and children and between different countries. It is estimated that in Italy the prevalence of AR in individuals aged 6 to 14 years is 33-35%, with an incidence that in the last five years showed an increase of 5%. Airway obstruction associated to AR is a risk factor for the development of malocclusion. According to many authors, any obstacle to the normal nasal airflow leads to non-physiological oral breathing, which determines postural changes such as open lips, low or frontal tongue, and lower posterior rotation of the jaw. This involves a modification of the pressure that the soft tissues exert on the teeth and on the facial bones, creating a situation of disequilibrium that negatively affects the normal growth of these structures. Although most authors recognize this correlation, other scholars do not associate the respiratory functions with dentofacial development, arguing that it is not possible to establish a direct relationship between the two factors. They emphasized the importance played by genetics in the manifestation of craniofacial alterations, emphasizing for example how \"longface\" subjects have a greater tendency to develop oral respiration compared to normal individuals. The therapeutic approach to these malocclusions is multidisciplinary and requires the intervention of the allergist and of the otolaryngologist together with that of the pediatric dentist and of the orthodontist in order to implement combined therapeutic protocols with the aim of restoring the airway patency through orthodontic-orthopedic therapy and myofunctional therapy. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children represents a broad spectrum of respiratory disorders characterized by partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway. Primary snoring (PS) identifies its mildest clinical manifestation. Evolving through progressively more severe forms, it can lead to the complete obstruction of the upper airways with cessation of the airflow, known as Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). Prevalence of OSAS in the pediatric age varies between 1 and 3% and its diagnostic approach is multidisciplinary.

Routinely, we tend to ascribe it to diabetes mellitus (DM), but there are many causes to be considered in the differential diagnosis and a thorough work-up will be needed in most cases.

As concern DM diagnosis, if symptoms are present, urinary 'dipstick' testing for glycosuria and ketonuria, or measurement of glucose and ketones using a bedside glucometer, provides a simple and sensitive screening tool.

Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity were considered to be mutually exclusive conditions. When considering patient with Primary Im-munoDeficiency (PID) we know that he is predisposed to recurrent and severe infections (hallmark of immunodeficiency). However, increased understanding of the complex immune regulatory and signaling mechanisms involved in immune system, is revealing the complex relationships between PIDs and autoimmune diseases. Many researchers have studied the pathogenesis of immune dysregulation can lead to autoimmunity/inflammation in the context of PIDs. These mechanisms include impaired production of flogistic citokynes (type I interferon or IL-1), defective negative selection of self-reactive T (APECED), defective editing of the B-cell receptor in the periphery, defective peripheral (self)-antigen-induced cell death (ALPS), gain of function of B-or T-cell activation/effector molecules, defective regulatory T cells (IPEX and IPEX like syndromes), homeostatic expansion of self-reactive T lymphocytes. Recently, Fisher et al. demonstrated that autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases are much more frequent by a factor of at least 10 in the cohort of patients with PID than in the general population. The spectrum of autoimmunity in PID is broad, but the increased risk is extremely high (by a factor of 120) for autoimmune cytopenia (anemia and thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal disease, or arthritis. These data suggest that patients with autoimmune anemia, thrombocytopenia, or both should be screened for PIDs during childhood. Moreover, the presence of autoimmunity or autoinflammation worsens the outcome for patients with PID, complicating the clinician therapeutic strategies. To find a balance among immunosuppressive therapy in patients and their susceptibility to infections is a clinical challenge.

Even so, the five-year survival has improved greatly in the last two-three decades, increasing up to 84% for tumours diagnosed in 2005-11. Currently, despite the extensive implementation of clinical trials and multidisciplinary approaches, survival outcomes for childhood malignancies have plateaued and a number of survivors live with long-term disabling sequelae through adulthood. The introduction of novel therapeutic agents, for relapsed patients and even into frontline treatments, could be the breakthrough needed in this landscape. [1] Novel anticancer agents comprise different drug classes, including immune-checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. anti-PDL1 for solid tumours and lymphomas), monoclonal antibodies (e.g. blinatumomab for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) or the newest gene-therapy with CAR-T cells. [1] [2] [3] These new agents act against the tumour together with the patient's immune system, keeping or enhancing its innate anticancer activity. This emerging approach is part of the precision medicine process; in fact, targeting different pathways specific for each kind of tumour, can help to achieve remission in larger cohorts of patients and, at the same time, can theoretically reduce the burden of toxic effect mediated by chemotherapy against healthy tissues. [4] Results are particularly encouraging in the field of acute lymphoblastic leukemia wherein fast-track approvals have been already granted by competent authorities. Several additional trials are attempting to get similar results in acute myeloid leukemia, in chronic leukemias and solid tumors. As often happens with new therapies also risks and side effects are emerging and could contribute to hamper the potential success of these agents when applied in the clinical practice such as the cytokine release syndrome and B-cell aplasia related to CAR-T cells therapy. Long-term consequences of these iatrogenic syndromes cannot be currently predicted.

[6] Vitamins are chemically unrelated families of organic compounds that need to be taken through diet because humans cannot synthesize them in adequate quantities. Each vitamin has unique functions in the body, including hormone regulation, cell proliferation, tissue growth and differentiation, and antioxidant effects; vitamins also serve as cofactors for multiple metabolic pathways [1] . Vitamins A, D, E, and K are lipid-soluble, whereas vitamin B complexes and vitamin C are water-soluble. A large amount of literature data supports the association of childhood gastrointestinal diseases and dysvitaminosis. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies have been described as either cause or effect of short bowel syndrome (SBS), which is the predominant underlying cause of intestinal failure (IF) usually after intestinal resection for congenital (intestinal atresia, malrotation with volvulus) or acquired (necrotizing enterocolitis, vascular thrombosis, or trauma) disorders [2] [3] [4] . Terminal ileal resection with gastric acid blockade significantly rise the risk of hypovitaminosis B12 in children with SBS. Another condition associated to dysvitaminosis is the transition, in SBS, from parenteral to full enteral nutrition [4, 5] . Maternal/neonatal hypovitaminosis D can be associated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) risk in premature infants supporting evidence that vitamin D plays a very important role in the intestinal homeostasis [6] . Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent (up to 35%) among pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [7] . Although low bone mineral density has not been attributed to dietary vitamin D deficiency, but rather to the inflammatory processes, attaining adequate vitamin D status in children with IBD is recommended [7] . Notably, the evidence in adult population suggests that vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with lower health-related quality of life and greater disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), but not those with ulcerative colitis (UC) [8] . Children with chronic diarrhea may present with deficiency of selected micronutrients such as vitamin A, and folic acid. Historically, celiac disease has been associated with many micronutrient deficiencies, particularly the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), since in the past celiac disease was usually diagnosed late following a period of prolonged diarrhea. Many studies have demonstrated that fatsoluble vitamin deficiencies are uncommon in modern-era pediatric celiac disease, probably because of earlier diagnosis, the routine use of vitamin supplements or fortification of cereal products with vitamins [9] . For all of the adult patients with a new diagnosis, the expert opinion recommends checking for vitamin D, vitamin A, zinc, copper, folic acid, and ferritin [10] .

Usually, an infant ingesting 150 ml of milk /Kg/day receives 10 g of lactose/Kg/day, which ensures at least 4 mg/Kg/min of glucose, considered as an optimal rate [2] . One of the mainly roles of lactose is to prevent rickets increasing the absorption of calcium and the galactose is essential to the production of cerebroside, which contributes to the CNS development [3] . Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are the third largest component in breast milk. Their concentration is about 10 times greater than in cow milk [2] .

HMOs act as prebiotics by providing a metabolic substrate for the growth of potentially beneficial bacteria. The structure-dependent effects of HMOs depend on the infant and mother. Two genes are important for the HMO profile that the mother produces, the Secretor and Lewis blood group genes. HMOs have protective effects against infectious agents [4] , inhibiting the link with the carbohydrates present on intestinal epithelial cells.

The scientific community interrogates itself on how to manage the situation. In the past years new approaches have been proposed [4] : teach professionals new strategies to promote changes, work in networks and face the stigma of weight [5] . For the first point we proposed therapeutic education (TE) [6] , a treatment method born in France and adopted by the World Health Organization to manage chronic diseases; the USA, Spain and other countries propose the motivational interview (MI), borrowed from addiction care. The two approaches have been included in various guidelines and recommendations [7] , but not in daily clinical practice in primary and second and third level healthcare [8] . These methods share several points: a good therapeutic relationship between professionals and patients, peer cooperation among the first, experts of the disease, and the second, experts of their own disease. However, such methods do not reconcile with the persistent managerial attitude of the professional [9] . Despite numerous currents that invite professionals to put the patient and his empowerment/engagement at the center of treatment [10] , professionals continue to prefer an increasingly technological medicine. Chronic diseases, like obesity, which involve the whole person and his experiences in both causes and consequences, are the most penalized and, when stigmatized, the worst treated [11] .

It is a responsibility to share with all caring figures that rotate around the child and with pediatric specialists. All the figures should work in synergy. No one should ignore the weight problem, nor judge and stigmatize the family [13] . many countries, although lacking in strong evidence of efficacy [1, 2] . Developed for addictions, the MI is a transversal instrument for treatment of several diseases, especially those in which the active involvement of patients and their families is irreplaceable, as obesity. In the 2007 document, a 15 minute example interview was added to facilitate adaptation to the primary pediatric healthcare clinic for the lifestyle improvement. Later, the professionals evidenced difficulty in adopting it with families with a consequent feeling of inefficacy and failure of both professionals and families [3] [4] . Fear of failure pushes professionals to exploit families' feelings of guilt, stressing the metabolic and cardiovascular risks of obesity. However, learning through negative emotions is not efficacious: everyone learns more with the teacher's smile and the student's alliance, than with fear of error [5] . In fact the MI does not easily adapt from treatment of addictions in adults to the pediatrician and the dyad parents-children with obesity. Some experts, like Dyane Tyler, tried to facilitate adaptation associating the principles of MI to those of Brazelton's collaborative negotiation, otherwise well known to many American pediatricians [6, 7] Her work has suggested the idea of using a simulation to train primary care pediatricians (Table 1 -2). In fact, only these pediatricians can exploit the alliance with parents and children and transform motivation from apparent Precontemplation to Determination, bringing to a project of Action (Table 3 ) [8] . If these pediatricians, although adequately formed, withdraw from their role, they become an insurmountable barrier to treatment, that no skilled team can overcome. Reviews of literature are with modest results [9] [10] . The scientific community interrogates itself on the correct allocation of resources. It would be useful to invest in adaptation of these approaches to childhood; push primary care pediatricians to treat obesity with more confidence and determination; form them to a MI reduced to its principle: \"absolute respect for patient's freedom of choice\", and to simple tools: open questions, simple and complex reflective listening, which should be respectful and prudent, while continuing to be pediatricians.

Extremely preterm infants (born \u226428 weeks of gestation) have 25-50% of risk for altered brain development, and subsequent abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used for the assessment of neonatal brain injury and development. However, MRI is expensive and does not allow bedside sequential monitoring. Therefore, other early biomarkers for prediction of brain injury and maturation are needed. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and multi-channel EEG may be useful tools to monitor brain function abnormalities in this high-risk population [1] . I will present a study aiming to investigate the relation between early brain activity and structural (growth of the cortex and cerebellum) and white matter microstructural brain development. Materials and methods: Thirty-three preterm neonates (gestational age 26\u00b11 weeks) without major brain abnormalities were continuously monitored with electroencephalography during the first 48 h after birth. The rate of spontaneous activity transients per minute (SAT rate) and the inter-SAT interval (ISI) in seconds per minute were calculated using an in-house developed program (SignalBase \u00ae ). Infants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging around 30 (mean 30.5; min: 29.3-max: 32.0) and 40 (41.1; 40.0-41.8) weeks of postmenstrual age. Increase in cerebellar volume, cortical gray matter volume, gyrification index, fractional anisotropy (FA) of posterior limb of the internal capsule, and corpus callosum (CC) were measured. Results: SAT rate was positively associated with cerebellar growth (p value=0.01), volumetric growth of the cortex (p value =0.027), increase in gyrification (p value =0.043), and increase in FA of the CC (p value =0.037). ISI was negatively associated with cerebellar growth (p value =0.002) [2] . Conclusions: aEEG/EEG can play an important role in monitoring brain development. Increased early brain activity is associated with cerebellar and cortical growth structures with rapid development during preterm life. Higher brain activity is related to FA microstructural changes in the CC, a region responsible for interhemispheric connections. The present study underlines the importance of brain activity for microstructural brain development. In the future, the opportunity to combine aEEG/EEG with other physiological data and additional tools will provide clinicians a wider overview of brain health status in the neonatal population. Phytotherapy consists in the usage of the plant as a whole (phytocomplex) with the purpose of curing diseases that affect children and adults. The active substances contained within the phytocomplex act in synergy, rather than in isolation, with the known specific functions [1] (i.e.Acetylsalicylic acid).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2101, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3021, "end": 3024, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 100, "text": "Tataranno", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A87"}, {"text": "As expert phytotherapy pediatricians, we strive to avoid that our patients retrieve their knowledge from sources of information such as family, community and social media [2] .

Spectrum of gluten-induced pathologies includes celiac disease, IgE-mediated wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity [1] . The first two conditions are well characterised as pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical spectrum, diagnostic biomarkers and follow-up are condidered. The third condition, in the absence of effective specific biomarkers, is still uncertain as for prevalence and nosologic autonomy; this is true mostly for gastrointestinal clinical presentations, whose limits with gastrointestinal functional disorders remains undefined. There are further conditions for which a gluten-free diet has been invoked, e.g. neurological diseases, autistic spectrum disorders, psoriasis, fibromyalgia and schizophrenia, but in many of these cases the evidences for gluten-free diet efficacy are, at best, weak [2] . Gluten-free products present a different composition in terms of macro and micronutrients; they contain less iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium, selenium, folates, vitamin B12, vitamin D and fibers. They also present an increased glycemic index and a higher content of carbohydrates and lipids rather than their gluten-containing equivalents [3] . Most important informations on nutritional values of gluten-free diets come from studies conducted on celiac subjects among which a higher amount of saturated fats and simple sugars with a lower intake of fibers and folates has been observed [4] . Despite these issues and a higher cost of this group of dietotherapeutic products, gluten-free diet has been popularly recognized as \"healthy\". Recent datas suggest that 30% of Americans would reduce or completely cut gluten from their diets. A special category of individuals is represented by athletes who, on the basis of some examples, have chosen gluten-free diet in order to improve their performances [5] . Gluten-free market is expected to raise more than 15 billions of dollars in 2018 [6] . Despite this growing demand, the evidence of beneficial effects totally lacks. For instance, no effect on weight loss ability has been demonstrated yet [6] . The induction of a glycemic prophile improvement has been claimed but, in fact, gluten-free products, losing their component of whole grains in their processing, are responsible of a postprandial glycemic higher increase [7] and ultimately of a minor protection against cardiovascular diseases [8] .

The differences in respiratory physiology between children and adults explain the higher susceptibility of infants to more severe manifestations of respiratory diseases, leading in some cases to blood oxygen desaturation. In children with non hypercapnic hypoxaemia, supplemental oxygen therapy is essential to maintain good level of blood oxygenation. In cases of more severely ill patients with significant respiratory distress and heavy work of breathing, highflow nasal cannula (HFNC) treatment can be offered to patients. The mild heated and humidified air pressure on a continuous basis allows to keep the airways open, prevents alveolar collapse with the final effect of recruiting more alveoli. Moreover, the heated humidification of the respiratory gas facilitates airway clearance. Thanks to all these mechanisms, HFNC improves patient's oxygenation, gas exchange and reduce the work of breathing which is extremely important in infants affected by LRTI. HFCN consists in the administration of heated and humidified mixture of air and oxygen at a flow rate higher than the patient's inspiratory flow [1] . The definition of high flow still need to be defined even though, in infants, high flow rates are considered >2 L/min, while in children, >6 L/min [1] . In clinical practice, some authors suggest to adjust the flow rates on body weight and recommend using 2 L/kg/min, which provides a degree of distending pressure and reduces the work of breathing [2] [3] [4] . HFNC should be initiated just if the following conditions are satisfied: 1) paediatric setting with a close monitor of the patient's clinical course 2) a sufficient number of staff that is well trained to recognize the early signs of failure. Accurate and frequent monitoring during HFNC treatment is very important to ensure its effectiveness and safety. The level and type of monitoring should be proportional to the patient's clinical condition. For patient being treated acutely in-hospital, continuous monitoring is indicated with a pulse-oxymeter or a multichannel cardio-respiratory monitor. A strict clinical observation is also mandatory and it must always assess respiratory rate and fatigue, level of dyspnea, signs of possible respiratory asynchrony, or shortterm possible complication of HFNC (i.e. gastric distension, nostril irritation etc...). Arterial blood gas analysis should be assessed after 1-4 h after HFNC is establishment. The Law inverted the trend of reduction of the coverage rates of vaccinations of the last years, as resulted from the epidemiological data of National Superior Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, the 'ISS'). The Law classified 10 vaccines as 'mandatory' instead of 'recommended' , as provided within the previous classification. Moreover, the Law has introduced some new immunizations and has recommended some others, as suggested by international literature and scientific evidences. A recent survey from the ISS shows that the coverage rates of vaccinations have been improved over the whole Italian territory, after the first year from the entry in force of the Law. Nevertheless all the doctors shall take in consideration the feelings, the fears and consciousness of caregivers to reduce hesitancy and conflicts concerning the immunizations, thus improving the implementation of the Law and of PNV. Creating a good relationship between caregivers and doctors is the best way to achieve the goal of children's health. In order to change people's opinion about the risk of vaccination is important to underline the benefits of the latter. In order to make easier for caregivers to understand the relevance for their babies to get immunized, preventing the risks of some preventable illness, the systemic counseling skills seem to be necessary. These skills include \"active listening\", the decrease of \"communication barrier mode\" (as described by Gordon [1] ), \"the three steps movement\", how to investigate the fears of the caregivers and how to assurance caregivers about the vaccination's benefits. This approach is not spontaneous and it has to be learnt by the healthcare professionals. This presentation wants to underline also some theoretical aspects of the Systematic Counseling Communication Theory (for instance, the Prochaska-Di Clemente Cycle [2] ), the verbal and non verbal communication, the level of relationship and contents of the communication. This presentation wants to be a starting point for medical doctors, pediatricians and health professionals to improve their communications skills with particular regard to vaccinations of children. The first 1000 days, from conception to completion of the second year, are fundamental for the future health, both physical and mental. The newborn should find an environment responsive to his needs and attentive to his vulnerabilities in order to best express his potential. In the first two years the bases of future personal and social skills are developed: from protocommunication to language, from intersubjectivity to relationship, from sensoriality to perception, from early mimetic-imitative mechanisms to praxic organization, from the first experiences of autonomy to the neuropsychological and learning functions, from regulation to behavior. Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) and in particular the pervasive ones, which include Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), can be identified in terms of specific vulnerabilities and through early indicators already in the first two years of life. The intervention, as a diagnostic-therapeutic process, but above all as assistance (servicesschool-family) will be individualized.

During the past decade, advances in genetic research have allowed genome-wide discovery of chromosomal copy-number changes and single-nucleotide changes in patients who developed NDD in childhood. These technological advances -which include array comparative genomic hybridization, single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays and, next generation sequencing -have transformed the approach to the identification of causative genes and genomic rearrangements and, they are currently applied in the clinical diagnostic arena [2] . However, only the most recent acquisitions i.e. the whole exome/whole genome massively sequencing technologies -have transformed our understanding on genomic variations and their relevance to health and disease, enabling the further rapid discovery of several single-gene causes in neuroscience as well as across disciplines [3] . Expanding the neurosciences' knowledge represents one the future major goals in research since these conditions have been highlighted among the most frequent reasons for medical referral and/or diagnostic workup. Indeed, in Western countries NDD -which include according to the DSM-5: attention deficit hyperactivity, autism spectrum, communication, intellectual developmental, motor and specific learning disorders -have an incidence of 1 in 66 to 1 in 100 children and, taken together, they represent one of the main population-wide health burdens [4] . Early diagnosis and appropriate access to interventions have been the only so far demonstrated to gain better long-term outcomes and, to reduce lifetime costs for individuals, families and society [5] . However, despite substantial progress on understanding the role played by deleterious genomic variants and their effector proteins on pathological mechanisms of cognitive disorders, few therapeutic interventions have been proposed so far [6] . Hence, connecting NDD's clinical and functional data represents a fundamental step in research since only through their physiopathological characterization, we will access on the dynamics that constantly shape and reshape our central nervous system. This approach will bridge the existing gap into their etiologic factors' incomplete knowledge, and will allow researchers to achieve consistent blueprints to widen the scope of new reliable diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Vitamin D is a key hormone in the regulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Moreover, the recently suggested role of vitamin D in the development of several non-skeletal diseases reinforced the interest in the promotion of an adequate vitamin D status during pediatric age. Skeletal actions of vitamin D: nutritional rickets represents the iceberg of vitamin D deficiency. The clinical presentation of rickets is variable but is more likely to be seen during periods of rapid childhood growth, such as infancy and adolescence. However, vitamin D deficiency may present with a spectrum of clinical pictures, representing a continuum ranging from asymptomatic/subtle conditions to overt rickets/osteomalacia [1] . Vitamin D status also represents an important lifestyle factor that influences bone mass acquisition, up to the achievement of peak bone mass [2] . Indeed, long-lasting unrecognized vitamin D deficiency during pediatric age may affect bone health, possibly predisposing to osteoporosis later in life. Extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: besides its historical skeletal functions, in the last years it has been confirmed that vitamin D plays socalled extraskeletal actions, directly or indirectly regulating up to 1,250 genes. Particularly, vitamin D status has been linked to the pathogenesis of several pathological conditions, including infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases [3] . Particularly, two recent metaanalyses showed that vitamin D supplementation protected against acute respiratory tract infection [4] , and significantly reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids [5] .

Subsequently, supplementation should be individualized on the basis of the presence of risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Particularly, supplementation is suggested from the end of fall to the beginning of spring in children and adolescents with reduced sun exposure during summer, while continuous supplementation should be proposed in cases of permanent risk factors for deficiency.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 433, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A96"}, {"text": "Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined by the presence of TSH levels above the upper limit of the reference range, in the presence of normal FT4 values. The incidence of SH in the pediatric population is about 2,9% [1] . The first diagnostic step in evaluating the thyroid function tests (TFTs) results is to use the correct reference range for age. In fact, the TSH and FT4 values are different according to the age of the patient. In the neonatal period, the TSH and FT4 values are much higher than subsequently. Second, the methods to measure TSH can be different and there are also intra-individual variations. For these reasons, it is important to obtain at least two different TFTs in order to make diagnosis of SH.

SH can be defined as mild (TSH 5-10 mcU/ml) and severe (TSH values >10 mcU/ml). The next important diagnostic step is to research the etiology. We need to take familiar anamnesis and patient's medical history, to test anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-tireoperoxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies) and to do a thyroid ultrasound. We have to differentiate between autoimmune and nonautoiummune forms. Autoimmune SH presents a higher risk of evolution toward overt hypothyroidism compared to non-autoimmune SH (39,1% versus 13,6% after a 3-year follow-up) [2] . Non autoimmune SH can be due to persistent neonatal hyperthyrotropinemia, genetic defects (TSHR, DUOX2, Thyroglobulin variants), iodine deficiency, drugs (anti-epileptic drugs, caffeine..), syndromes (Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Di George syndrome, Pseudohypoparathyroidism), and obesity. SH in obese children is usually reversible and should be managed with lifestyle measures that encourage weight loss. Finally, when all the known etiologies have been excluded, we talk about idiopathic SH. Idiopathic SH rarely evolves toward overt hypothyroidism. Wasniewska et al. showed that 88% of patients with idiopathic SH normalized or maintained unchanged their TSH [3] . Idiopathic SH in children seems to be a benign and remitting process, with a low risk of progression to overt thyroid dysfunction [4] . Currently, there is no evidence to recommend treatment for all children with mild asymptomatic SH. The management of a child with SH should be individually tailored on several factors, such as the degree of the TSH elevation, the etiology, the presence of symptoms and risk factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 689, "end": 692, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1364, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1500, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A96"}, {"text": "Every year, thousands of adopted children arrive in Italy from all over the world: over 2000 in 2014 and 2015, 1872 in 2016, 1439 in 2017. These children mostly come from the Russian Federation, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Hungary, Poland, Vietnam and China. According to CAI (Commission for International Adoptions) [1] , in the first quarter of 2018, 181 out of 273 adopted children (66%) had special needs: congenital malformations, genetic diseases, or infections (hepatitis, CMV, HIV) that are reported before adoption. When adopted children arrive in Italy, it is necessary to re-evaluate their health conditions and to verify their vaccination status. For this reason GLNBM-SIP has organized a network of 22 centers in Italy specializing in international adoption where children's health is evaluated according to a special adoption protocol and targeted to the area of origin [2] . In 2016-2017, GLNBM's hospitals evaluated 2516 children (76% of the 3310 adopted minors who arrived in Italy during the same period). Many of these children were affected by malformations, had outcomes of congenital infections, parasite infestations or TB disease; several cases reach early puberty soon after adoption. The majority of adopted children were inadequately vaccinated. In addition to the health evaluation of adopted children, 10 Centers perform training activities for adoptive parents that focus, in particular, on health risk evaluation as well as consultancies for interested institutions, and for local social assistant services. More recently, in order to respond the increased number of requests from adoptive parents and institutions, some co-workers of the GLNBM started to offer long-distance consultations in cases of children with Special Needs and pathologies declared only at the time of meeting with the adoptive parents. A network of hospitals, territorial services, Courts for minors, CAI and other agencies is required to effectively accommodate the needs of children and adoptive families. At present in Italy only some Regions and Autonomous Provinces have established regulations concerning the health care of adopted children, however, at the national level there has yet to be any legislation on this. The Italian Society of Pediatrics together with the CAI can play a key role in helping launch concrete actions to promote legislations aimed at protecting the health of adopted children as well as offering training and support to couples in their difficult parental roles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 319, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 883, "end": 886, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A96"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Laparoscopic appendectomy in the elderly", "authors": [{"first": "Y", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Yang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Chung", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Jeng", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Surg Endosc", "volume": "20", "issn": "", "pages": "887--88", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "References 1.

Amongst the different types of images, that of Mary breastfeeding or about to breastfeed Jesus stand out for their peculiarity, highlighting both the humanity and divinity of Christ. In several cases the two characters are represented alone, painting an intimate, tender scene, at the time of breastfeeding. In others, the breastfeeding scene is part of a wider context that includes other characters, as in the works representing the Holy Family, the Flight into Egypt, the Sacred Conversation. In others, the act of breastfeeding elects the Virgin Mary as a mediator between the worshippers and God. The most ancient known effigy of Mary dates back to the II/III Century and it is in fact a Nursing Madonna located in the Catacomb of Priscilla in Rome. The official start of this iconography of Mary dates back to the Council of Ephesus (431 AC) which declared the dogma of Mary as the Mother of God and not only of the God-Man Jesus. In subsequent times this iconography would mostly develop within Byzantine art, in church paintings, where Mary would often be represented frontally, sitting on a throne, with the Baby resting on her knees, and in icons. The latter differentiate in many typologies of images, with increasingly affectionate representation such as that of Mary breastfeeding. In the early 300, the iconography of the Virgin Mary evolved greatly, especially in Tuscany. The representations, developed at the same time, of pregnancy and breastfeeding convey a desire to humanise the holy sphere with a new conception of Mary, seen as a woman within a family environment. To the earlier Paleochristian and Byzantine representations, typically solemn and sacral, this period juxtaposes representations of Mary displaying a simple and spontaneous attitude, intimate and very natural in her maternal duties. The restrictive guidelines of the Council of Trent had great impact on religious representation and on the representation of Nursing Madonna as well. Devotion for the iconography was heartfelt, but it was an expression of the Apocryphal Gospels, in which popular fantasy enhanced many of the narrations of the Canonical Gospels.

Its incubation period is 7-10 days and course usually is divided in catharral stage (1-2 weeks), including malaise, sneezing, rhinorrea, lacrimation, mild cough, paroxysmal stage (several weeks) characterized by coughing spells occurring in succession, for difficulties in expelling thick mucus from airways, and resulting in emesis, cyanosis, bulging eyes, lacrimation, distension of neck veins; characteristic is the high-pitched inspiratory whoop following prolonged cough attacks. Infants can show bradycardia, apnea and feeding difficulties. Adolescents can present weight loss (33%), urinary incontinence (28%), syncope (4%) and rib fractures (4%). Convalescent stage begins when paroxysmal attack wanes and lasts 2-3 weeks, but any other respiratory infection can exacerbate pertussis symptoms. Infants hospitalized for pertussis show apnea (50%), pneumonia (20%), seizure (1%) and death (1%) as main complications [1] . Laboratory test used for diagnosis is time-sensitive: in fact, culture and PCR sensitivity decreases from 70% and 80% a 10% and 21%, respectively, from the first two weeks of coughing to the period following the second week from the cough onset. Serology has a low sensitivity during the early stage of the infection; this method is useful mostly for epidemiological purposes [2] . A Cochrane review established that antibiotics neither reduce mortality, nor significantly modify the course of the disease, or prevent complications, but reduce transmission of the disease to other persons. eradicating the bacteria from the nasopharynx, as long as it is administered within six weeks of the onset of cough in younger patients (<12 months), and within three weeks in all other patients. Macrolides are first line antibiotics, cotrimoxazole and clyndamicin are further options. Corticosteroids, bronchodilators, antitussives, and antihistamines are not generally recommended [1] . The current prevention is entrusted to an acellular vaccine containing several major antigenic proteins (pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin (PRN), and 2 fimbrial agglutinogens) , but perplexities about its immunogenicity are increasing owing to a progressive rising of pertussis incidence in many countries, maybe for reduced ability of this vaccine to induce mucosal immunity, fundamental in reducing the duration of nasopharyngeal carriage of B. pertussis and limit personto-person transmission, although recent data shows that pertussis resurgence is not universal and the geographical variation in trends does not support a single explanation, such as the transition from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines [3] [4] [5] .Recently, the Interregional Board \"Immigrants and Health Services\" of The Italian Regions Conference, together with the contribution of various Ministries, Scientific Societies, and stakeholders (UNHCR, Save the Children, Caritas), set up a \"Protocol for the identification and the holistic multidisciplinary age assessment of foreigner, unaccompanied children\". The produced protocol respects the European directives on human rights and gives clear indications for age assessment (AA), unifying the previous, diverse methods performed in Italy, which mostly used invasive procedures (unethical according to International law courts' opinions) as ionizing X-rays for bone or dental age.The protocol underlines the role of the pediatrician of the \"National Health Service\" in this AA procedure, but also the important and indispensable contribution of professions such as social workers, cultural mediators and child neuropsychiatrist and / or developmental psychologists. This multidisciplinary method avoids that the determination is only based on the degree of physical and pubertal maturation of the alleged minor but also takes into account his/her psychological, social and cultural maturity and also considers the administrative investigations, if the safety of the child and/or his family at home is not endangered. In addition, invasive procedures (X-rays) are always discouraged and allowed only in a few specific cases, well motivated by the examiners. The AA performed only through medical methods could not give an exact response and, if in the 95% of the cases the possible error is + 2 years, in the remaining 5% could be also + 3-4 years. This range of variability is not acceptable, especially in ages near the legal limit of 18 years. Moreover, this method guarantees to the alleged minor the respect for his person and his legal protection, and it seems to be the best system, even if the result could be not completely correct because any form of AA is not an \"exact science\". Also with this method it is important to indicate a range of the possible age (average plus/ minus 2 standard deviations) and it is sufficient that only the lower age (-2sd) falls below 18. The protocol in comparison with other international ones and with what was done before, confirms its scientific nature and the respect for human rights, providing recourse to invasive tests only in extreme situations and always with the informed consent of the subject. The \"Italian law 47/2017\" refers to this \"multidisciplinary method\" as the best way to perform AA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1086, "end": 1089, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1471, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2068, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2814, "end": 2817, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2818, "end": 2821, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2822, "end": 2825, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
