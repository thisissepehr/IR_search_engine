The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila encodes for six proteins that contain the OmpA-like domain, among them the highly conserved uncharacterized protein we named CmpA. Here we set out to characterize the CmpA protein and determine its contribution to intracellular survival of L. pneumophila. Secondary structure analysis suggests that CmpA is an inner membrane protein with a peptidoglycan-binding domain at the C-teminus. A cmpA mutant was able to replicate normally in broth, but failed to compete with an isogenic wild-type strain in an intracellular growth competition assay. The cmpA mutant also displayed significant intracellular growth defects in both the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii and in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, where uptake into the cells was also impaired. The cmpA phenotypes were completely restored upon expression of CmpA in trans. The data presented here establish CmpA as a novel virulence factor of L. pneumophila that is required for efficient intracellular replication in both mammalian and protozoan hosts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Legionella pneumophila is the bacterial pathogen that causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia that if left untreated can lead to death McDade et al. 1977) . L. pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium, which is found ubiquitously in the environment as a parasite of protozoa (Fields 1996) . It is considered an accidental opportunistic human pathogen, because it can cause disease in immunocompromised individuals, but cannot be transmitted between individuals (Yu et al. The transport mechanism of the Dot/Icm secretion system is not well understood, with limited structural data available (Kubori et al. 2014) , and largely undefined substrate selectivity (Nagai et al. 2005; Burstein et al. 2009 ). One of the Dot/Icm components, DotK/IcmN, has been implicated in playing a role as a cellwall anchor of the Dot/Icm secretion system through the binding to peptidoglycan (Nagai and Kubori 2011) . The DotK/IcmN protein is one of six L. pneumophila proteins containing the domain called OmpA-like, or OmpA-C-like, annotated as Pfam F00691 (Finn et al. 2013) . The OmpA-like protein domain denotes homology to the C-terminal portion of the canonical Escherichia coli outer membrane porin OmpA. Proteins containing an OmpA-like domain are predicted to bind to peptidoglycan at the cell wall, and are important for the virulence of a number of intracellular pathogens, including Francisella tularensis (Mahawar et al. 2012) , Leptospira interrogans (Ristow et al. 2007) and Coxiella brunetii (Martinez et al. 2014) . Of the six L. pneumophila proteins containing an OmpA-like domain, the best studied is DotK/IcmN, which is encoded within one of the two dot/icm loci. The dotK/icmN gene is dispensable for intracellular replication within human macrophages, but is partially required during replication in the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii (Segal and Shuman 1999) . Three other OmpA-like proteins are predicted to function as structural components of the flagella: MotB, MotD and Lpg2962. The lipoprotein Ppl/PAL is a surface exposed protein (Ludwig et al. 1991; Hoffman, Ripley and Weeratna 1992) , and has been explored as a possible diagnostic tool, as it can be detected in the urine of patients with Legionnaires' disease (Kim et al. 2003; Gholipour et al. 2014) . Finally, the OmpA-like protein that is encoded by open reading frame Lpg0657 is a highly conserved protein within the Legionella genus, but has not been studied to date. Here we set out to characterize the potential role of the Lpg0657 OmpA-like protein in the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila. We find that the Lpg0657 protein, which we renamed CmpA, is required for efficient intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in both the protozoan host A. castellanii and in primary murine macrophages, but not in broth. The importance of the CmpA protein may be in part due to its contribution to bacterial uptake into host cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 163, "text": "McDade et al. 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 284, "end": 297, "text": "(Fields 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 470, "end": 480, "text": "(Yu et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 600, "end": 620, "text": "(Kubori et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 667, "end": 686, "text": "(Nagai et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 687, "end": 707, "text": "Burstein et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 881, "end": 904, "text": "(Nagai and Kubori 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1066, "text": "(Finn et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1429, "text": "(Mahawar et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1475, "text": "(Ristow et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1520, "text": "(Martinez et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1879, "text": "(Segal and Shuman 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2078, "text": "(Ludwig et al. 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2113, "text": "Hoffman, Ripley and Weeratna 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2260, "text": "(Kim et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2283, "text": "Gholipour et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "All bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 .

All experiments were repeated three times, and a representative experiment of each is shown. Figure 4 . The cmpA mutant has an intermediate salt resistance phenotype. The ability of the different strains to grow in the presence of 100 mM NaCl was assayed by spotting bacteria on plain CYE plates (control) or CYE plates supplemented with 100 mM NaCl. Plate grown cells were scraped, resuspended in H2O and adjusted for OD600 nm . Ten-fold serial dilutions of the wild-type strain CR39 (WT), mutant strain SN272 (cmpA) and dotA-deficient strain CR58 ( dotA) were plated and allowed to grow at 37 \u2022 C for 3 days. A representative experiment out of three repeats is shown. . Uptake into mouse macrophages is reduced in the cmpA mutant. The efficiency of uptake into bone marrow-derived A/J mouse macrophages was tested using a gentamicin protection assay. L. pneumophila strains were used to infect macrophages at an MOI of 100, uptake was allowed to proceed for 10 min before the cells were treated with gentamicin to eliminate extracellular bacteria and cell lysates plated for CFU. CFU recovered from the cells infected with wildtype strain CR39 (WT), mutant strain SN272 (cmpA), dotA-deficient strain CR58 ( dotA) and the wild type and cmpA strains harboring plasmid pIG1 (WT pCmpA and cmpA pCmpA, respectively) are plotted. Uptake of the cmpA strain is reduced by roughly 50%, and is restored to wild-type levels in the complemented strain. Values represent the mean number of viable bacteria recovered from triplicate wells \u00b1 standard error of the mean.

The CmpA protein is one of six L. pneumophila proteins that contain an OmpA-like homology domain, often associated with virulence. CmpA is highly conserved within L. pneumophila. Nevertheless, a cmpA mutant replicates as well as wild type in broth; therefore, the CmpA protein is unlikely to serve a housekeeping function under these conditions. The strong conservation of the CmpA protein, together with the inability of the cmpA mutant to compete against the wild-type strain in an intracellular growth competition, highlights the evolutionary importance of the cmpA gene as it pertains to intracellular survival. Secondary structure analysis of the CmpA protein sequence suggests that it is an inner-membrane protein, with two transmembrane helices. The presence of a predicted OmpA-like domain strongly suggests that CmpA has the capacity to bind to peptidoglycan at the cell wall. None of the other L. pneumophila proteins containing the OmpA-like domain are predicted to span the inner membrane twice; therefore, CmpA is likely to have a structure and a function that are distinct from those of the other L. pneumophila OmpA-like proteins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Salt resistance of the cmpA mutant was assayed in order to determine if CmpA could play a role in the maintenance of the bacterial envelope. Interestingly, we found that not only does the cmpA mutant not display a defect growing in the presence of salt, but growth of this mutant was actually better than that of the wild type under high-salt conditions (Fig. 4) . Salt resistance in L. pneumophila has been strongly correlated with mutations in the Dot/Icm secretion system (Vogel, Roy and Isberg 1996) , presumably due to decreased leakiness of the Dot/Icm system in these mutants. The cmpA mutant shows an intermediate salt resistance phenotype, with resistance that is higher than that seen in the wild type, but lower than that observed for the dotA mutant. This data suggest that the CmpA protein may interact with the Dot/Icm secretion system, or with another transport apparatus, contributing to the overall flow through that system. For example, CmpA could function as part of a larger complex, and may help anchor that complex to the cell wall, similar to Escherichia coli MotB (DeRosier 1998), which also contains an OmpA-like domain and several transmembrane helices.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 475, "end": 503, "text": "(Vogel, Roy and Isberg 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 362, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Obtaining a clean deletion mutant of cmpA could not be achieved, possibly due to a polar effect that such a deletion would have on neighboring genes.

To exclude the possibility of a polar effect in the transposon mutant studied here, a com-plementation vector was used for the expression of CmpA under the control of the Ptac-inducible promoter. Both the intracellular growth defects and the uptake defect seen with the cmpA transposon mutant were completely restored upon complementation in trans.
