These pandemic influenza strains then persistently circulate in the human population and cause seasonal epidemics. For example, H3N2 viruses have continuously circulated in human population since the 1968 pandemic. Influenza A viruses contain eight gene segments, which include PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS [2] . Antigenic shift is caused by reassorting of gene segments while antigenic drift is caused by an accumulation of mutations in genes during virus evolution. Under the pressure of host immunity and the environment, viruses which can survive with new mutations, may keep circulating and potentially become a major public health threat [3] . Consequently, although specific anti-viral drugs as well as vaccination strategies have been developed and applied, annual seasonal epidemics still result in millions of severe cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, it is essential to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms of influenza A viruses.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the homo-oligomer formation and RNA binding are crucial for virus replication and a single amino acid mutation can reduce the polymerase activity [5] [6] [7] [8] . In regards to function, NP contains an RNA binding domain, a PB2 binding domain, a homo-oligomer binding domain and a nuclear localization signal domain (NLS) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Many studies further observed that NP interacts with many host factors to promote viral replication, escape immunity, or regulate apoptosis [11] .",

            "text": "Most previous studies on influenza A have focused on the change of viral surface proteins, HA and NA. For instance, A(H3N2) viruses have been monitored for antigenic variants and different vaccine strains have been selected based on their novel antigenic characteristics that can be mapped by hemagglutination inhibition [12] , and also identified by their HA gene sequences. However, the evolution of internal genes, such as NP, also plays an important role in viral fitness and pathogenicity, but has generally lacked attention. We hypothesized that in the evolutionary history of a relatively conserved protein, mutations arising over time might also be meaningful. Thus, we evaluated the influenza virus NP, a major multifunctional protein in the virion, to identify novel evolutionary or functionally important determinants of viral replication. Previous studies have shown that the evolution rates of viral genomes in influenza A are different with the rate in H3N2 greater than in H1N1 and also than influenza B viruses [13, 14] . Clinical reports also showed that the H3N2 viruses led to high mortality in the 1991-1998 and 2003-2004 influenza seasons, in which the latter was associated with an unusually high number of fatalities in children. In addition, several studies also demonstrated that the H3N2 caused more severe diseases than H1N1 and influenza B viruses [15] [16] [17] . In Taiwan, H3N2 influenza viruses were monitored as the main circulating subtype, its epidemic rate was higher than H1N1, and the HA gene was consistent phylogenetically with H3N2 viruses reported elsewhere [18, 19] . Thus, in our study, clinical isolates of H3N2 viruses that were kept from surveillance samples at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital were used to examine novel determinants on NP that may play a role in influenza virus evolution.",

Since every year was analyzed independently, we could observe the changes in amino acid sequence types through the year, and the most dominant one could be the same in different Table 1 The dominant NP amino acid sequences of each year from 1999 to 2018 a The sequence types, their number and the proportion to total sequence collected in the same year were analyzed and calculated. Only percentage over 5% in each year were listed in this table The residues in bold in Table 1 defined as sporadic substitutions because they only existed in dominant types in several years and did not become conserved. The number of any amino acid sequence type with a sporadic substitution was calculated and the percentage in total sequence number was obtained (Fig. 2) . Table 1 showed the dominant sequence types with their percentage, while Fig. 2 showed the amount of sporadic substitutions in each year, which may be identified in various sequence types even in those that were not listed in Table 1 (< 5%).",

The most dominant sequence in each year (the percentage showed in Table 1 ) was also included in the phylogenetic tree and showed similar time distribution among clades as Taiwan isolates. When comparing protein variations, the backbone of NP in majority showed significant change before and after 2004 ( Table 1) Other than those residues that composed the major sequence backbone, another 15 amino acid changes were observed. Although these changes, we defined them as sporadic substitutions, did not remain conserved in major backbone they appeared in some periods during evolution. Figure 2 showed the percentage of these changes from 1999 to 2018; among these, 31R, 377G, and 450S had been over 50% while each was dominant in a different year. The 31R was dominant in 2000 (53.64%) and was 15% in 2001 while showed low frequency in other years (from 0 to 5.28%) (Fig. 2) .

Therefore, substitutions at residues 31, 377 or 450 that appeared to have had a higher frequency in NP evolution history were further investigated.

Alanine mutation at residues 208 and 416 served as negative controls according to previous studies [5, 23] . To examine whether genetic variations at these three positions altered polymerase activity, A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP (31 K-377S-450S) was used as a backbone to generate mutations for analysis. Polymerase genes from A/Taiwan/ 3446/02 strain were used as backbone for this assay. By site-directed mutagenesis, single, double and triple Table 1 were further calculated their percentage in total global sequences in each year from 1999 to 2018. The percentage of more than 10% of residues 31R, 377G and 450S were labeled (31R in red, 377G in blue and 450S in green). To easily observed the curve of 31R, 377G and 450S, all other residues colored in gray but with different symbols mutations at residues 31, 377 and 450 of NP were generated. The relative polymerase activity pattern between different NPs were similar both at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C ( Fig. 3a and b) . Amino acid change at residue 450 (from G to S) statistically decreased polymerase activity as shown when comparing NP 31 K-NP 377 S-NP 450 G (KSG) with NP 31 K-NP 377 S-NP 450 S (KSS) and NP 31 K-NP 377 G-NP 450 G (KGG) with NP 31 K-NP 377 G-NP 450 S (KGS). The single substitution at residue 377 (when comparing KSS with KGS, and RSG with RGG at both temperatures; KSG with KGG at 37\u00b0C and RSS with RGS at 33\u00b0C) did not result in a significant change of activity. Although it showed no significant difference when comparing KSS with RSS, polymerase activity between KSG and RSG as well as between KGG and RGG showed statistical differences that demonstrated the effect of substitution at residue 31 (from K to R). Thus, we concluded that residues 31 and 450 modulated the polymerase activity and NP with 450G had a higher activity while 31R downregulated polymerase activity. To further investigate the role of residues 31, 377 and 450 of NP on polymerase activity, alanine substitutions were analyzed. Both 31A and 450A, but not 377A, statistically decreased polymerase activity when compared with A/Taiwan/3446/02 NP both at 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C ( Fig. 3c and d) . Thus, we suggest alanine substitution at 31 and 450 of NP dramatically decreased the RdRP activity. Because either mutation in residues 31 or 450 would significantly decrease the polymerase activity, except residue 377, both residues 31 and 450 were critical in regulating the polymerase activity.",

To achieve this goal, a reverse genetics system was used to produce viruses with specific mutations on NP. In this system, the A/Taiwan/3446/02 strain served as genetic backbone that provided the other seven gene segments to rule out other gene effects on virus replication. To examine the viral growth properties of viruses with variant residues at 31 and 450 of NP, onestep replication and multi-step replication cycles in A549 cells were examined at a MOI of 1 and a MOI of 0.01, respectively ( Fig. 4a and b) . The results indicated that viruses with 31K-450G had higher viral titers than 31R-450G, 31K-450S, and 31R-450S from 4 h post-infection in one-replication cycle as well as 24 h post-infection in multi-step growth curve. These findings demonstrated the substitutions found in the NP evolution changed viral growth properties that may act via regulation of the polymerase activity. Reverse genetics viruses with alanine mutation at residues 31, 377 and 450 were also analyzed. We observed that virus with 31A or 450A statistically decreased viral growth, whereas 377A had similar growth kinetics as rg-A/Taiwan/3446/02 virus (Fig. 4c) .",

However, crucial residues may exist at sites that have yet to be identified. Via alanine mutation and reverse genetics system, 74 conserved residues among influenza viruses were analyzed and their impact on virus replication or RNA incorporation were identified [10] . For example, R208A and R416A, which served as negative control in the mini-genome assay were shown to have very low polymerase activity and failed to rescue as reverse genetics viruses. There have been several evolutionary analyses focused on the NP gene segment in recent years [24, 25] and by phylogenetic analysis, separate clades from human, avian or swine origins can be identified. Some positive selection sites on NP were found, one of which was residue 450 [16] . The 31R substitutions identified here was also observed by the Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan, however, the effects of substitution have not been investigated until now [19] . Owing to the multiple roles of NP, there is no specific assay for analyzing the functional variability or the Fig. 4 Variations on NP-31 and NP-450 residues affected viral growth kinetics. A549 cells were infected with reverse genetics with different amino acid composition as indicated at (a) MOI of 1 and (b)(c) MOI of 0.01 at 37\u00b0C.

The mini-genome assay is used widely to investigate the impact on virus replication, and the major role of NP in virus infection and replication. Therefore, we applied this assay to screen the evolution of genetic variations and further demonstrated their effects on virus replication by examining these changes in viruses generated by reverse genetics. In this study, genetic variations of NP observed in evolution were further analyzed and we demonstrated that NP-31 and NP-450 may have important effects on virus replication.",

In our ferret study, neither the body temperature change nor the weight loss showed any comparative differences. The rgNP-31K-450G virusinfected ferrets did however show slower gain in weight post-challenge and shed virus for a day longer compared to the rgNP-31K-450S virus challenged ferrets. To investigate whether this enhancement of viral properties correlated with larger influenza outbreaks or disease severity, we looked at the human seasonal influenza (H3N2) epidemiology for Taiwan. Notably, viruses with NP-450G was the dominant circulating strain since 1968, whereas in the 2006-2007 influenza virus season, NP-450S appeared temporarily in Taiwan (Additional file 2). The excess morbidity of H3N2 was reported as being low in 2006-2007, with only 0.98 per 100,000 population, compared to 2003-2005 with an average range value of 3.06-6.01 per 100,000 population [26] . Thus, the effect of the evolutionary variations that we investigated in vitro can also reflect on the ferrets in vivo study, which can also in turn reflect on human epidemiology. Here, we tried to correlate with epidemiology reports, whereby NP-450S reduce morbidity in the 2006-2007 influenza virus season, however, there are still many concerns and/or parameters that could not exactly be filtered out, therefore, further study is required.",

Amino acid differences at residues 50 and 98 on NP have shown to result in high intracerebral pathogenicity in chicken by a duck origin, low pathogenic H7N1 influenza virus [27] . Positions 105 and 184 of NP contribute to virus replication and pathogenicity of avian H5N1 influenza virus [28, 29] . The substitution NP-D375N of 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus resulted in better adaption to mice [30] . These studies indicated that genetic variations on NP affect not only the pathogenicity but also host adaptation. In other studies, the changes in pathogenicity by NP-D101G and NP-N109T substitutions resulted in the modulation of polymerase activity [31, 32] . Thus, in addition to NP residues identified to date, more work is required to better understand the role of NP in human influenza evolution and fitness. Avian influenza infection is a great threat to humans and it is important to understand the mechanism of host adaptation. The E627K substitution of PB2 is a well-known case where a single mutation contributes to enhancing replication of avian influenza in mammals [33] . The NP-N319K mutation affects the interaction of NP with host factor importin-\u03b1 and leads to an increase in virus replication [34] . Although there were a few adaptive mutations identified to date, further investigation of NP may reveal more novel aspects that NP plays in host adaptation since NP has multiple roles in virus replication and interacts with various host factors.",

In our phylogenetic data, clade 1, where sequences were similar to A/Sydney/5/97, there was a clade separated from the other clades 2-6.

A previous study showed that mutated phosphorylated residues reduced viral titer [38] , and the same effect was observed in our study whereby 377G slightly decreased the polymerase activity. Thus, the post-translational modification may also have some functions and participate in NP's evolution.",

            "text": "Epistasis, which is a term used in genetics and evolution, is defined as some mutations being tolerated only after the occurrence of others that can have either positive or negative effects [39] . In evolution, epistasis may play a key role in immune escape and drug resistance [40] . Epistasis was found in the NA protein of influenza H1N1 virus and contributed to the emergence of resistant strains [41] . Gong and Bloom predicted the evolution trajectory of H3N2 viruses from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007 strain by computational analysis and Fig. 6 Weight, temperature change and viral shedding in nasal wash of ferrets. Ferrets were infected intranasally with 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 500 \u03bcL of viruses with NP substitutions. a Temperature and (b) weight changes were monitored. Nasal wash specimens were collected and expressed as 50% log10 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50). In (c) viral shedding curve and (d) viral shedding dot plot, viruses with different substitutions were separated by colors and shapes; each dot represents the viral titer in nasal wash of each ferret. Two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons with Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 found that the epistatically constrained variations were destabilizing and had required another mutation to stabilize the NP [42] . They demonstrated three single mutations (L259S, R384G, and V280A) which decreased polymerase activity, but the gain of other mutations before these mutations had occurred can rescue their deleterious effect. Some of the residues of NP backgrounds before and after 2004 that we had identified by the global evolution were included in their predicted trajectory and the V280A was demonstrated to be under the control of epistasis. In this study, we focused on those sporadic substitutions which were not analyzed by previous studies and showed that 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity and they may need other mutations to stabilize and to support conservation through evolution.",

NP-31 and NP-450 were identified as possible sites that affect polymerase activity and also had an effect on viral replication, transcription, translation, growth kinetics, and in a ferret infection study. In conclusion, we demonstrated that two NP protein substitutions acquired from evolution appear to have an impact on some influenza viral properties. Hence, we suggest that the evolutional genetic variations of NP should be continuously monitored, and their effects determined.",
