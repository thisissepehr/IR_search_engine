Haplotype analysis of the HNF1B region harboring the genome-wide significant associated SNPs. The rs numbers are given across the top. Eleven haplotypes were observed with a frequency of 2% or greater. The haplotypes are color-coded based on the allele found on the most common haplotype (black). The serous ovarian cancer single SNP P -values and odds ratios are given below the haplotypes followed by the indication of which allele was modelled for the single SNP risk analysis. The single SNP clear cell ovarian cancer P values and odds ratios are given below. The serous and clear cell associations with each haplotype are given to the right of the haplotypes. The most common haplotype was set as the reference group and each haplotype odds ratio is given relative to the most common haplotype. The 10 th and 11 th haplotypes were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of serous ovarian cancer. Both of these haplotypes carry eight of nine genome-wide significantly associated SNPs and haplotype 11 also carries the ninth, rs61612821. The r2 between rs61612821 and the top associated serous SNP, rs7405776, is only 0\u00b722 because rs61612821 only falls on one of the three haplotypes carrying rs7405776. This haplotype structure demonstrates that the signal between these SNPs cannot be disentangled. Haplotypes four and eight are also associated with increased risk of serous ovarian cancer, but did not reach statistical significance and they are uncommon. Both of these haplotypes carry at least one of the genomewide significant serous SNPs. Figure S7 . HNF1B promoter methylation is unlikely to be a passenger event by global DNA methylation changes. We compared the DNA methylation level at 104,033 CpG loci that are unmethylated (beta value <0\u00b72) in the 10 normal samples, in 254 serous tumors to 17 clear cell (Mayo panel) with two-sample t-test. The raw p values are adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method and the -log10 adjusted p values are plotted as the y axis in the volcano plot, against mean beta value for clear cell minus mean beta value for serous, as the x axis. The non-shaded area indicate adjusted p<0\u00b705, absolute difference in beta value > 0\u00b72. A subset of 1,003 is used for Figure 3 , with an even more stringent cut-off of the adjusted p value <0\u00b7005, indicated by the dashed line. The red stars indicate the HNF1B loci. We can see that while clear cell tumors generally have far more hypermethylation, HNF1B is one of the few genes hypermethylated in the serous subtype. This argues against the possibility that HNF1B hypermethylation in the serous subtype is a passenger event with global hypermethylation. and red indicate high methylation (Beta value=1) for each of the loci interrogated by HM450 at this region. The heatmap is subdivided into six subpanels, to separate samples (rows) with the three different genotypes (star indicates the risk allele) at rs11658063 (position indicated with a red arrow), and CpG loci (columns) as upstream and downstream of the transcription start site. We can see that the genotypes at rs11658063 (location indicated with an red arrow) influences overall DNA methylation level, but the influences are more pronounced for the upstream promoter region. Plotted as the y axis is the log intensity (a,b) or log ratio (c) for SPP1, and the x axis that for HNF1B. The platform information, Pearson Correlation value and p value testing for linear correlation is given in the title for each panel. While SPP1 is a downstream target of HNF1B in EEC and clear cell ovarian cancer cell, its expression does not seem to correlate with HNF1B expression in the serous tumors. -value  rs3744763  0\u00b756  1\u00b713 0\u00b791 -1\u00b740  0\u00b726  0\u00b707 0\u00b795  0\u00b745 -2\u00b701  0\u00b789  0\u00b733  0\u00b777 0\u00b764 -0\u00b793  0\u00b701  17-36092841  0\u00b734  1\u00b711 0\u00b787 -1\u00b741  0\u00b740  0\u00b753 1\u00b723  0\u00b782 -1\u00b785  0\u00b731  0\u00b740  0\u00b787 0\u00b772 -1\u00b704  0\u00b713  rs7405776 0\u00b729 ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 60, "end": 69, "text": "Figure S5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1650, "text": "Figure S7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2308, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3731, "end": 3946, "text": "-value  rs3744763  0\u00b756  1\u00b713 0\u00b791 -1\u00b740  0\u00b726  0\u00b707 0\u00b795  0\u00b745 -2\u00b701  0\u00b789  0\u00b733  0\u00b777 0\u00b764 -0\u00b793  0\u00b701  17-36092841  0\u00b734  1\u00b711 0\u00b787 -1\u00b741  0\u00b740  0\u00b753 1\u00b723  0\u00b782 -1\u00b785  0\u00b731  0\u00b740  0\u00b787 0\u00b772 -1\u00b704  0\u00b713  rs7405776", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Tagging SNPs (tSNPs) were selected in the HNF1B region using the program SNAGGER 34 from the International HapMap Project CEU population (White) in order to cover all SNPs in the region with a minor allele frequency of 0\u00b705 with an r2 of 0\u00b780.
