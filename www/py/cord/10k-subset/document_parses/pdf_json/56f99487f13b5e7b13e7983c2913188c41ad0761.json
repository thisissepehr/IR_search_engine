            "text": "The proteasome is a central regulatory hub for intracellular signaling by degrading numerous signaling mediators. Immunoproteasomes are specialized types of proteasomes involved in shaping adaptive immune responses, but their role in innate immune signaling is still elusive. Here, we analyzed immunoproteasome function for polarization of alveolar macrophages, highly specialized tissue macrophages of the alveolar lung surface. Classical activation (M1 polarization) of primary alveolar macrophages by LPS/IFN\u03b3 transcriptionally induced all three immunoproteasome subunits, low molecular mass protein 2 (LMP2), LMP7 and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1, which was accompanied by increased immunoproteasome activity in M1 cells. Deficiency of LMP7 had no effect on the LPS/IFN\u03b3-triggered M1 profile indicating that immunoproteasome function is dispensable for classical alveolar macrophage activation. In contrast, IL-4 triggered alternative (M2) activation of primary alveolar macrophages was accompanied by a transcriptionally independent amplified expression of LMP2 and LMP7 and an increase in immunoproteasome activity. Alveolar macrophages from LMP7 knockout mice disclosed a distorted M2 profile upon IL-4 stimulation as characterized by increased M2 marker gene expression and CCL17 cytokine release. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of IL-4-responsive genes and of genes involved in cellular response to defense, wounding and inflammation in LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages indicating a distinct M2 inflammation resolving phenotype. Moreover, augmented M2 polarization was accompanied by amplified AKT/STAT6 activation and increased RNA and protein expression of the M2 master transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 in LMP7 \u2212 / \u2212 alveolar macrophages. IL-13 stimulation of LMP7-deficient macrophages induced a similar M2-skewed profile indicative for augmented signaling via the IL-4 receptor \u03b1 (IL4R\u03b1). IL4R\u03b1 expression was generally elevated only on protein but not RNA level in LMP7 \u2212 / \u2212 alveolar macrophages. Importantly, specific catalytic inhibition with an LMP7-specific proteasome inhibitor confirmed augmented IL-4-mediated M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages. Our results thus suggest a novel role of immunoproteasome function for regulating alternative activation of macrophages by limiting IL4R\u03b1 expression and signaling.",

Specific inhibition of the catalytic activity of LMP7 with a novel proteasome inhibitor revealed an extended function for immunoproteasomes in autoimmunity. 2, [4] [5] [6] Studies with immunoproteasome subunit knockout mice indicated that immunoproteasomes also regulate composition and activation of lymphocyte subsets and maturation and differentiation of B and Th17 cells, which may relate to the altered transcriptional profile and cytokine expression of immunoproteasome-deficient immune cells. [7] [8] [9] [10] These data suggest that immunoproteasome function affects both adaptive and also innate immune cell homeostasis. 11, 12 We here investigated immunoproteasome function in alveolar macrophages, which in the lungs express particularly high levels of immunoproteasomes. 13 These cells are highly specialized tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the respiratory surface of the lung and are essential for the pulmonary host defense against inhaled pathogens but also for resolution of tissue damage. [14] [15] [16] [17] Similar to the well-studied bone marrow-derived macrophages, alveolar macrophages are highly plastic within a multi-dimensional spectrum of pro-and anti-inflammatory activation states depending on the cytokine milieu. 18 Upon acute infection or injury, alveolar macrophages are activated into a classically activated M1 phenotype, and potently secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines to initiate recruitment of inflammatory cells. 19 M1 polarization involves LPS/IFN\u03b3-mediated activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors promoting expression of classical M1 marker genes and enhanced pathogen phagocytosis. Following the acute inflammatory burst, however, alveolar macrophages can remove cell debris and apoptotic inflammatory cells by so-called efferocytosis and polarize into alternatively activated M2 macrophages. 20 In response to IL-4/-13 or IL-10 signaling, alveolar macrophages then acquire an anti-inflammatory state characterized by metabolic changes, activation of anti-inflammatory signaling factors, expression of M2 marker genes and the production of anti-inflammatory and growth-promoting cytokines. [21] [22] [23] Otherwise, at certain disease conditions, M2-derived repair factors may also promote Th2 inflammatory settings and may thus have profibrotic activity. [24] [25] [26] Here, we show that alternative M2 but not classical M1 activation is regulated by the immunoproteasome as revealed by augmented M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages upon genetic deficiency of LMP7 and specific catalytic inhibition of LMP7.",

To investigate, whether immunoproteasome activity of alveolar macrophages is of any functional relevance for macrophage polarization, we polarized primary cells from wild-type (wt) and LMP7 \u2212 / \u2212 mice toward M1 or M2 phenotypes, respectively. LMP7 disruption did not affect viability during polarization (Supplementary Figure S3A ) and had no effect on M1 marker gene expression such as Nos2, Tnf, Il1b and Il12b (Figure 2a ). In accordance, gene expression levels of some of the transcriptional activators of M1 polarization such as Nfkb1, Rela and Irf5 were not altered by LMP7 deficiency (Supplementary Figure S3B) . Intriguingly, LMP7 deficiency enhanced the IL-4 effect on alternative M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages (Figures 2b and c) . Gene expression of the major M2 marker Arg1, as well as the Th2 cytokine Ccl17 were clearly increased in LMP7 \u2212 / \u2212 compared with wt cells. In addition, Retnla mRNA expression was considerably elevated in LMP7 \u2212 / \u2212 cells, whereas Mrc1 expression was not altered. For Arg1 expression, this effect was already evident at lower doses of 1-5 ng/ml IL-4 (Supplementary Figure S3C) . Secretion of CCL17 into supernatants of polarized alveolar macrophages was also significantly enhanced in M2-polarized cells from LMP7 \u2212 / \u2212 mice as determined by ELISA. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that expression and activity of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 is of functional importance for alternative M2 activation of alveolar macrophages.",

Increased expression of IRF4 in LMP7-deficient M2 macrophages was confirmed by qRT-PCR in a kinetic analysis from 6 to 72 h of IL-4 stimulation (Figure 4c ). We also confirmed M2-specific mRNA induction of IRF4 in different primary cells from C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice and in the MH-S cell line (Supplementary Figure S4C) . At the protein level, IRF4 increased up to 72 h only after IL-4 stimulation (Supplementary Figure S4D) . Moreover, shortterm stimulation of alveolar macrophages with IL-4 revealed elevated levels of IRF4 after 180 min in LMP7-deficient cells ( Figure 4d ). This coincided with aggravated phosphorylation and thus activation of STAT6 and AKT, the two major signaling hubs for IL-4-induced M2 polarization (Figures 4e and f, Supplementary Figures S4D and E) . 22, 23 Our transcriptomic and signaling data thus corroborate that LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages have intrinsic differences that govern a differential signaling response to IL-4 toward M2 macrophage polarization.",

Elevated IL4R\u03b1 expression by LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages thus represents a plausible explanation for augmented IL4R signaling and enhanced IL-4/-13-induced M2 polarization.",

To confirm the role of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 for M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages and also to validate LMP7 as a drug target for modulation of IL-4 receptor signaling, we made use of the recently developed LMP7-specific immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX-0914. 6, 31 This inhibitor has been shown to discriminate between the standard 20S \u03b25 subunit and its immunoproteasome counterpart LMP7 and thus specifically inhibits LMP7. We first proved specificity of ONX-0914 for LMP7 using MH-S cells and an ABP pulldown assay. 32 Quantification of affinity-purified \u03b25 and LMP7 proteasome subunits by western blotting revealed that LMP7 was specifically lost by 50% and 80% when cells had been treated with 0.1 or 0.2 \u03bcM ONX-0914, respectively, whereas \u03b25 was decreased only to a minor extent (~30%) at the highest dose of 1 \u03bcM (Figure 7a ). Specificity of ONX-0914 for the LMP7 immunoproteasome subunit was also confirmed by direct western blotting of cell lysates of ONX-0914-treated cells (Figure 7b ). Here, inhibitor-bound versus unbound active subunits were differentiated by a mobility shift of LMP7 and \u03b25. In a next step, we treated MH-S cells with ONX-0914 and analyzed IL-4-mediated signaling and M2 marker gene expression. MH-S cells were pretreated with 0.2 or 1 \u03bcM ONX-0914, for a total of 5 h and stimulated with IL-4 for 180 to 15 min (see treatment scheme, Figure 8a ). Very similar to the genetically depleted LMP7 macrophages, specific inhibition of LMP7 or enhanced IL-4-dependent STAT6 phosphorylation and resulted in elevated levels of IL4R\u03b1 (Figure 8b) , which was most prominent at high inhibitor doses. Importantly, the LMP7-specific inhibitor significantly increased expression of the M2 polarization markers Arg1, Irf4 and Mrc1, which was particularly evident for 1 \u03bcM of ONX-0914 and was reproducibly observed in primary alveolar macrophages (Figure 8c ). In summary, our results reveal that LMP7 immunoproteasome activity is crucially involved in IL4R-driven alternative polarization of alveolar macrophages, most likely via limiting the expression of IL4R\u03b1.",

The absence of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 augmented the ability of alveolar macrophages to respond to IL-4 and to polarize toward the M2 phenotype, but did not affect classical M1 activation. Accordingly, the M1 expression profile of well-known pro-inflammatory transcription factors of classical macrophage activation, for example, NF-\u03baB1 (p50/p65) and Irf5, was not altered in LMP7-depleted cells. Although the role of immunoproteasomes for canonical NF-\u03baB1 signaling has been controversially discussed, 35 we conclude that LMP7 is not required for p50/p65 signaling during M1 polarization of alveolar macrophages.",

These have been shown to have altered enzyme kinetics that may account for the distinct phenotypes of the single immunoproteasome Immunoproteasome regulates macrophage polarization S Chen et al knockout animals. 9, 12, 37, 38 In order to exclude that the presence of mixed immunoproteasomes in LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages accounts for augmented IL-4 signaling and M2 polarization, we specifically inhibited the catalytic activity of LMP7 in alveolar macrophages using the LMP7specific inhibitor ONX-0914 and assayed for M2 polarization. This approach also allowed us to investigate the druggability of immunoproteasome-dependent alternative activation of alveolar macrophages. ONX-0914 is the first of a novel class of site-specific immunoproteasome inhibitors that preferentially binds to the LMP7 catalytic site as demonstrated by crystal structure analysis of mouse immunoproteasomes 4 and active site-based ELISA. 6 It has been shown to provide potent in vivo anti-autoimmune activity in several mouse models. 6, 5 Here, we used an activity-based pulldown to prove increased binding specificity of ONX-0914 to LMP7 over \u03b25 and thus preferential inhibition of LMP7. Importantly, pretreatment of primary as well as MH-S cells with ONX-0914 increased IL-4 triggered M2 polarization. Again, IL4R\u03b1 expression and STAT6 signaling were considerably augmented by impairment of LMP7 function.

            "text": "Since the initial recognition of IL-4-mediated alternative macrophage activation, 39, 40 numerous studies have investigated polarization mainly of bone marrow-and monocytederived macrophages. The finding that tissue macrophages are of different origin and self-renew throughout life, [41] [42] [43] however, has stimulated research on the polarization capability of alveolar macrophages as a specific set of tissue-resident macrophages. 23 The essential role of alveolar macrophage plasticity for the maintenance of respiratory health is well established. 23, 27 Proinflammatory M1 alveolar macrophages not only fight invading pathogens but also contribute to tissue damage of infected airways. 44 In a similar manner, M2-polarized cells are not only required for proper resolution of airway inflammation or pulmonary wound healing, 16 but excessive M2 activity also contributes to the pathology of chronic lung diseases characterized by increased tissue remodeling as evidenced for asthma but also suggested recently for pulmonary fibrosis. [45] [46] [47] Specifically, isolated macrophages obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis reveal an alternatively activated phenotype, produce high levels of the Th2-related chemokine CCL18 and stimulate fibroblast collagen production. 25 In contrast, in the Th2-driven inflammation and fibrosis model of helminth infection, alternatively activated macrophages have been shown to counterbalance acute inflammation, inhibit Th2 cell differentiation and cytokine production thereby contributing to reduced fibrosis. 48, 49 The specific role of alternatively activated macrophages thus appears to be disease-dependent and may be further influenced by the origin of the macrophages as tissue-resident alveolar macrophages or inflammatory blood-derived macrophages. In support of this notion, inflammatory monocytes facilitate progression of pulmonary fibrosis, whereas alternatively activated lung macrophages have a resolution-promoting potency during the reversible phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. 24 In the same model, the inhibitory cell surface receptor, paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B), which is abundantly expressed on myeloid cells of fibrotic lungs, was shown to inhibit pulmonary fibrosis and alternative macrophage polarization, suggesting that PIR-B inhibits the profibrogenic properties of alternatively activated alveolar macrophages. 50 In this context, recent research indicates that M2-skewed alternative activity of lung macrophages and in particular, M2-mediated induction of CCL17, enhances their profibrotic program, and/or causes a Th2-prone pathological setting thus paving the way for pulmonary fibrosis or asthma. [51] [52] [53] Augmentation of alternative macrophage activation by immunoproteasome dysfunction most likely has important consequences for homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli of the pulmonary tissue. Intriguingly, there is not much known about regulation of immunoproteasome expression and activity in respiratory disease. A recent study suggested elevated expression of immunoproteasome subunits in alveolar macrophages in patients with sarcoidosis. 54 Preliminary data of our group also suggest increased protein levels of LMP7 in BAL cells isolated from fibrotic lungs of bleomycin instilled mice. Future studies using LMP7-deficient mice will investigate the functional relevance of LMP7 activity for the course of bleomycin-triggered pulmonary fibrosis. Immunoproteasome function in macrophages has also been reported to be affected by alcohol and virus infection. 55 Our own data indicate downregulation of immunoproteasome function in the lung by cigarette smoke. 56 These data support the notion that immunoproteasome function in macrophages is affected by environmental stimuli and possibly altered in the course of pulmonary fibrosis. Promoting pro-resolving M2 macrophage polarization represents a promising strategy to alleviate excessive inflammatory conditions as exemplified by corticosteroid treatment of patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in case of acute exacerbations. [57] [58] [59] Under more severe inflammatory conditions of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury, however, therapeutic application of steroids remains controversial as these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome during late stages of ARDS. 59, 60 Alternative strategies of macrophage modulation that protect against acute lung injury include deletion of Akt2 kinase to effectively enhance M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages in mice while completely abrogating M1 polarization. 61 However, protection was limited to aseptic ARDS conditions, as the complete blocking of classical macrophage activation impaired innate immune response of alveolar macrophages to live bacteria, which is required for effective bacterial clearance. Therapeutic strategies that augment M2 activation but retain M1 plasticity may thus be more favorable for the treatment of acute lung injury. Immunoproteasome-specific inhibition may represent according to our results a more favorable approach for the treatment of pneumonia-or sepsis-related ARDS.",
