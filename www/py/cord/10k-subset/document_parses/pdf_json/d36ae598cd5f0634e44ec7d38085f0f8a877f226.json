            "text": "Major life-threatening complications following blood transfusion are rare and human error remains an important aetiological factor in many. The infectious risk from blood transfusion is predominantly hepatitis, and non-A, non-B and hepatitis C (HCV) are the most common subtypes noted. The risk of posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) appears to be decreasing and this is attributed to both deferral of high-risk donors and more aggressive screening of donated blood. Screening for HCV is expected to decrease this risk further. The risk of HIV transmission following blood transfusion is negligibly small. There are data to suggest that perioperative blood transfusion results in suppression of the recipient' s immune system. Earlier recurrence of cancer and an increased incidence of postoperative infection have been associated with perioperative blood transfusion although the evidence is not persuasive. Microaggregate blood filters are not recommended for routine blood transfusion but do have a role in the prophylaxis of non-haemolytic febrile reactions caused by platelet and granulocyte debris in the donor blood. Patients shouM be advised when there is likely to be a requirement for perioperative blood transfusion and informed consent for transfusion shouM be obtained. Epidemiological linkage between blood transfusion and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was postulated in 1983 and established in 1984.1.2 Although the risks and complications of blood transfusion had been well documented before the association between AIDS and blood transfusion was confirmed, many physicians had been slow to incorporate this data into their clinical practice. The advent of AIDS and the patient/consumer activism that has resulted has forced a re-evaluation of the risk factors relating to the adverse effects of blood transfusion. Not only has is it become necessary to establish a need for blood before each transfusion, but it is mandatory that the physician be aware of the risks of transfusion and be able to communicate these to the recipient. The purpose of the following discussion is to review the mostrecent data available in order to allow an accurate assessment of the risk of blood transfusion. Table I provides a list of complications related to homologous blood transfusion and will provide the basis for the following discussion.",

Immediate haemolytic reactions, although rare, continue to be a concern as they are the major cause of transfusionassociated mortality. Walker estimated that acute haemolytic transfusion reactions occurred at a rate of one per 25,000 units transfused and 51% of the transfusionassociated deaths reported to the US Food and Drug Administration were as a result of acute haemolysis. J'4 The acute or immediate haemolytic reaction is almost invariably due to ABO incompatibility resulting from a type-mismatch between the donor and recipient. In the past this reaction was largely attributed to clerical error with the donor blood being mislabelled at some stage of processing. However, Honig has reported an increase in errors classified as \"blood given to wrong patient. ''5 Although physician error alone was implicated in only about 20% of the deaths resulting from such errors, the most common site of physician error was the operating room and the anaesthetist was the physician implicated most frequently. Protocols should be in place within operating theatres that allow for the proper identification of blood and recipient in order to eliminate such errors.",

            "text": "The quantity of antibody in the acute haemolytic reaction appears to determine the resultant morbidity and mortality. Group O recipients have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies distributed throughout their plasma volume and t.o a lesser extent, their extravascular space. If group O recipients receive type A, B or AB blood, the biological consequences of this incompatibility to the patient are greater than after a smal~ volume of donor plasma containing antibodies directed against the recipient's cells is transfused (i.e., group O to a recipient of group A). Consequently, 81% of the transfusion-associated deaths due to acute haemolysis reported from 1976 through 1985 occurred in type O recipients receiving type A, B or AB blood. 4 The antigen-antibody interaction activates the complement cascade and this results in lysis of the donor cells. 6 Haemoglobin released from the lysed cells is bound to haptoglobin and albumin but these binding proteins are quickly saturated, The remaining free haemoglobin is cleared by the kidneys. Complement activation results in release of complement fragments which are potent vasodilating compounds as well as thrombin generation and platelet activation. These processes lead to hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Renal damage is a consequence of multiple factors including glomerular deposition of fibrin, reduced renal blood flow and deposition of Ab-Ag completes. Free haemoglobin does not directly damage the kidney but can contribute to renal failure if it is precipitated in the renal tubules. The most commonly cited signs and symptoms of an acute haemolytic reaction, each occurring in at least 20% of the cases reported to the FDA were: (1) haemoglobinuria, (2) disseminated intravascular coagulation, (3) haemolysis, (4) oliguria with subsequent renal failure, and (5) hypotension. 4 In the anaesthetized patient, symptoms may be less variable and hypotension, urticaria and abnormal bleeding are common. 7 If a haemolytic reaction is suspected, the transfusion should be stopped. The blood should be rechecked to ensure that the patient is receiving the correct blood and then returned to the blood bank for re-typing and microbiological assessment. Blood should be drawn from the patient to verify the ABO group, to look for free haemoglobin, to assess the coagulation status and for microbiological assessment. Patient management emphasizes support of the circulation with aggressive fluid therapy. 6 Renal function should be maintained by adequate fluid therapy and the use of osmotic diuretics. Renal morbidity may be lessened if urine volumes in excess of 60 ml. hour -~ can be maintained. Administration of platelet concentrates and plasma may be necessary to treat the intravascular coagulation. Plasma exchange has been recommended to remove the free haemoglobin in the event of large volume administration of incompatible blood. 7 Delayed haemolytic reactions occur within one to two weeks of the transfusion of previously \"compatible\" blood. Most such reactions are characterized by the reappearance of an antibody directed against donor erythrocyte antigens that was initially and remotely produced in response to a pregnancy or previous transfusion. The antibody-coated donor erythrocytes are eliminated in the spleen and have a shortened survival time. The laboratory findings of the delayed haemolytic reaction include a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin test. Although delayed haemolytic reactions are not widely believed to be of serious consequence, 10% of the transfusion-associated deaths reported to the FDA were attributed to delayed haemolysis by the reporting physician. 4 Alloimmunization occurs after red cell transfusion. The recipient may produce antibodies directed against antigens on the red cell membrane. Fluit reviewed 186 patients who received at least six units of blood, s Twenty-two patients produced antibodies and although the risk of alloimmunization increased with the number of units transfused, most patients were immunized after two or three transfusions. This phenomenon has implications for both difficulty in future crossmatching and perhaps an increased incidence of delayed haemolysis with future transfusion.",

            "text": "The most common immunological reactions to leukocyte antigens can be characterized as troublesome rather than clinically serious. The interaction of recipient leukocyte antibodies with donor leukocytes and phagocytosis of donor leukocyte fragments stimulate host macrophage production of endogenous pyrogens and result in a febrile, nonhaemolytic reaction. A more serious reaction is that of transfusion-associated acute lung injury, manifest as noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, occurring during or within six hours of a transfusion. This reaction is estimated to occur in one in 10,000 transfusions. 3 The mechanism is considered to be a reaction between passively transferred antileukocyte antibodies and recipient leukocytes which are degraded particularly in the pulmonary circulation. 7' 9 Fifteen percent of transfusion-associated mortality is attributed to acute pulmonary injury. 4 Alloimmunization to platelet antigens following transfusion of platelet concentrates appears in about half the patients subjected to repeated platelet transfusions (i.e., for replacement in bone marrow depression after chemotherapy). The result is an antibody-dependent elimination of the platelets in the liver or spleen and a lack of therapeutic response to subsequently transfused platelets. Posttransfusion purpura is a rare syndrome occurring about one week after platelet transfusion. It is speculated that donor platelet glycoproteins complex with recipient platelet glycoproteins and that recipient antibodies are bound to native platelets. The platelet aggregates are then destroyed in the liver and spleen.",

            "text": "In 1943 Beeson described \"several cases of jaundice one to four months after transfusion of whole blood or plasma.\"~~ Since then post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH) has become well recognized as an important complication of blood transfusion. Although we do not know the true risk of acquiring hepatitis as a result of a blood transfusion, the available data do allow some conclusions to be drawn. Most cases of transfusion associated hepatitis are both anicteric and asymptomatic and the incidence of PTH derived from series of patients in whom serum transaminase levels are repeatedly sampled after transfusion may be 100-fold greater than when the incidence is derived from cases of reported clinical PTH. ~ The incidence of PTH appears to have declined over the last decade. This is a result not only of the implementation of screening tests (Table II) to eliminate donated units contaminated by hepatitis B (HBsAg) but also of the more recent exclusion of donors from the donor pool who were at increased risk for carriage of blood-transmissible disease. Nine percent of potential volunteer donors in Canada are deferred after completion of a screening questionnaire (personal communication, National Office, Canadian Red Cross Society). The incidence of PTH was estimated at between 6-38% before the implementation of HbsAg screening in 1972 and between 30-55% of PTH cases were attributed to hepatitis B virus) 2 Over the next decade, although hepatitis B-attributed PTH cases decreased to 10% of the total cases of PTH, there was little change in the overall incidence of PTH. This is presumed to be a result of the implementation of more intensive surveillance of patients after blood transfusion resulting in the more frequent diagnosis of asymptomatic and anicteric cases of PTH. Also, hepatitis B was probably overemphasized in earlier reported series of PTH because of the failure to diagnose a large number of the anicteric cases of PTH. Nevertheless, there appears to be a decrease in the incidence of PTH over the last decade in studies that emphasized careful and prospective surveillance of patients following blood transfusion. 13\"14 Although most of the data collected on transfusion-associated infectious disease was collected on patients receiving red cell transfusion, it is generally assumed that the risk associated with other components is similar. Derivatives prepared from large donor pools (i.e., factor concentrates) or components from multiple donors concurrently administered (i.e., platelet concentrates) are associated with a higher risk of disease transmission. Although there is not a linear relationship between disease transmission and transfused volume, a relationship between the number of units transfused and the incidence of PTH has been reported. Is Early studies failed to distinguish between volunteer and commercial blood donors but, given that the risk of disease transmission was as much as six-fold greater with commercial donations, this may have influenced their observed incidence of PTH) s A more recent report by Koziol documented an increased incidence of FTH with higher volumes of blood transfused) 6 However, the increased incidence of PTH was attributed to the increased likelihood of receiving an hepatitis C antibody (anti-HBC) positive unit with the higher transfused volumes rather than the increased volume per se. ~ The incidence of PTH must be related to the prevalence in the donor population and therefore the incidence of PTH in one geographic region does not reliably predict the incidence in another. Finally, there is a background incidence of hepatitis in hospitalized, non-transfused patients of 0.14-2.2% and though it is not likely that this background occurrence accounts for a large proportion of transfusion-associated hepatitis, it cannot be discounted. 17.~a Hepatitis non-A, non-B (NANB) is the most frequent type of PTH, hepatitis B (HBV) is next and hepatitis as a result of hepatitis A virus (HAV), CMV or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) occurs rarely. Dienstag 19 concluded that there was little evidence that HAV played an important role in PTH and Lindholm 13 reported only two cases of PTH as a result of HAV over an eight-year period with 360,000 transfusions assessed. Blood banks do not screen for HAV because it is rarely a factor in PTH, there is no HAV carrier state, and the infectious period for HAV is usually limited to a one-to-two-week viremic period. 2~ Sirchia reported one case each of PTH resulting from CMV and EBV in a four-year prospective surveillance of 2959 surgical patients, accounting for 3.8% of the total cases of PTH in the series reported.t4 Koziol labelled CMV as the responsible agent in seven cases of PTH, accounting for 12.5% of the cases and occurring in 1.4% of patients who received transfusion.~6 Transfusion-associated CMV infections are usually benign and self-limited but may result in serious, even fatal, infections in immunocompromised patients. 2~ Recipients of bone marrow transplants and premature infants have been described as groups at risk for serious transfusion-associated CMV infections and CMV seronegative units have been recommended for these two groups. 21 ' 22 Hepatitis B virus continues to be an important aetiological factor in PTH. Hepatitis B develops in 0.3 to 1.7% of transfusion recipients and accounts for 7 to 17% of PTH cases although screening of blood donations for hepatitis B surface antigen has been carried out since 1972. 23 The reported incidence of HBV-associated PTH varies and is probably accounted for by the varying prevalence of the carrier state in the donor populations.t3'23'2* The incidence of HBV-seropositivity in donated blood in Canada (1990-91) is 0.03% of all donated units (personal com-munication, National Office, Canadian Red Cross Society). It is not clear why PTH type B continues to occur despite screening but Hoofnagle has proposed the following hypotheses: (1) mistakes are made in the screening of blood, missing HBV+ve units; (2) transmission occurs by means other than transfusion and the transfusions are inappropriately implicated because of a temporal relationship; (3) an infectious donor is in the incubation period of acute hepatitis B (one to six weeks from infection until appearance of HbsAg); and (4) a seronegative infectious donor who is a carrier of low-level HBV donates blood) 3 Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBC) appears in the serum of patients eight weeks after infection with hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis B is more frequent after transfusion with anti-HBC positive blood than with anti-HBC negative blood. J3.23.25.~6 The recent implementation of screening for anti-HBC may further reduce the incidence of PTH secondary to HBV.",

            "text": "The dominant aetiological agent in PTH is non-A, non-B virus (NANB). Once again, there are regional differences in the reported incidence of PTH in patients receiving blood transfusions with recent series documenting incidences of 2.4--4.6% in Scandinavian countries, 4.3% in Italy and 7.2% in the United States. ~3' t4'6 The variability in the incidence is likely a reflection of the background prevalence in the population. The majority of the cases will be both anicteric and asymptomatic and diagnosis is based on prospective studies of serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the documentation of persistently high or high fluctuating levels of ALT. Despite its relatively mild presentation during the acute infection, NANB PTH has a disturbing tendency to progress to a chronic state marked by a persistent carrier stage. Persistent hepatitis occurs in about 50% of patients and cirrhosis occurs in 10-20% of patients with persistent hepatic disease) 3'19 NANB hepatitis has been recently renamed hepatitis C because both a viral particle and a plasma antibody to that virus have been identified. Blood banks are now routinely screening for hepatitis C. The incidence of HCV-seropositivity in donated blood in Canada ( 1990-91) is 0.08% of donated units (personal communication, National Office, Canadian Red Cross Society). Concern remains that NANB hepatitis may be a result of more than one virus and because the hepatitis-C screening test does not become reliably positive during periods of peak elevation of hepatic enzymes, there continues to be a role for surrogate NANB screening (serum transaminases) in order to eliminate donor units capable of transmitring NANB hepatitis. However, the recent report by Sirchia documenting a 50% reduction in the incidence of PTH, following the implementation of HCV screening in their institution, is encouraging. It has been demonstrated previously that antibody to HIV appears in the blood between six and fourteen weeks after infection with HIV. 28 However, Wolinsky reported that HIV infection could remain silent for up to 42 mo and Imagawa recently reported persistent seronegativity in patients at high risk for HIV infection, from whom the virus itself could be recovered. 29' 3~ Haseltine has hypothesized that this may occur when the virus fails to stimulate the immune system to elaborate antibody or when a brief period of seropositivity is followed by an absence of antibody) j The phenomenon of delayed seroconversion has been reported only in individuals at high risk for HIV infection and transfusion-associated HIV infection has not resulted in such circumstances. 3~ However, there have been 11 reported cases of transfusion-associated AIDS from screened blood where there were other recipient risk factors not related to blood transfusion or where the donors were confirmed to be seronegative. 2s While the presumption has been that another mode of transmission was responsible in these cases, the possibility that some donors were antibody-negative but infected with HIV remains. It should be acknowledged that appropriate self-disqualification among high-risk donors would have prevented virtually all of the documented cases of HIV transmission by seronegative donors to date and that aggressive educational programmes may be of more value in reducing or eliminating the problem than more extensive blood testing. 2s Finally, it should be recognized that, because of aggressive donor screening and blood testing by the blood banks, HIV transmission by blood transfusion is negligibly small and that hepatitis remains the dominant clinical concern.",

            "text": "There are a number of complications related to the transfusion of large volumes of blood (> one blood volume) at rates of infusion of 90 ml. rain-' or greater. These complications result from the constituents of the preserving solutions used in blood banking and the temperature (4 ~ C) at which blood is stored as well as the effects of storage on solutions of red cells, most notably progressive hyperkalaemia and acidosis of the plasma fraction. Hypothermia may result from rapid transfusion of large volumes of cold blood. Hypothermia has been associated with increased mortality in traumatized patients and preservation of normothermia may enhance survival in critically ill trauma patients. 35 This topic will be discussed under the heading of blood Warmers. Progressive hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia and acidosis may result from the transfusion of large volumes of stored blood. Clinically important metabolic acidosis as a result of transfusion is seen only in patients who have received blood at rapid rates of transfusion (1.2 ml. kg -1. rain-l). 36 Although it is difficult to separate the component of the metabolic acidosis that is a result of the rapid transfusion from that caused by lactate production in injured patients with hypotension and inadequate tissue oxygenation, rapid transfusion and restoration of circulating volume and blood pressure is likely to reduce endogenous lactate production and improve the outcome in critically injured patients. 35 ' 37 The exogenous lactate administered with the blood is likely to be well tolerated if circulating volume and blood pressure are maintained. 36 There is considerable excess calcium-binding capacity given the current volumes of citrate anticoagulant added to stored blood and following rapid transfusion of large volumes of stored blood, serum hypocalcaemia may result. 36\"3s The hypocalcaemia is transient and there is little evidence that it is an important clinical concern in most patients. 36 However, myocardial dysfunction has been reported during rapid transfusion and has been attributed to low serum calcium concentrations. 39 Hyperkalaemia has long been recognized as a potential but uncommon complication of rapid transfusion: ~ However, recent reports have documented considerable, albeit transient, hyperkalaemia during rapid blood transfusion for hypovolaemia and lethal arrhythmias have been attributed to the elevated serum potassium concentration. 36' 42-*~ It is likely that these complications were not commonly reported in the past due to the technological limitations which prevented very rapid blood transfusion. However, technology has progressed so that it is possible to transfuse 500-1000 ml. min -! and to replace greater than four blood volumes per hour. '~'45 These rates are well in excess of the 90-120 ml-min -~ that have been reported to be associated with hyperkalaemia. 36' 46 In a recent case report of a lethal hyperkalaemic intraoperative arrest it was documented that the patient received blood replacement of packed cells containing 23.6 mmol. L -~ to 34.4 mmol. L -I of potassium at infusion rates of 420 ml-min -! or greater. 44 It was later calculated that the patient received 9.9 mmol. min -t of K \u00a7 At the time of arrest the serum K \u00a7 concentration was 10.7 mmol. L -I. This suggested that such rapid infusion rates of hyperkalaemic packed cell solutions fail to provide sufficient time for redistribution of the potassium load throughout the extracellular space which results in high potassium concentration in the central compartment, myocardial toxicity, and cardiac arrest. 42-4 Wall has suggested that hypothermia, shock, acidosis and aortic crossclamping may decrease the volume of the central compartment and promote further elevations in serum potassium as well as enhancing the toxicity of the hyperkalaemia? 2 This potential fluctuation of the central compartment and the resulting modification of the volume of distribution may explain the lack of a consistent correlation between the rate of transfusion and the degree of hyperkalaemia in patients receiving rapid and massive transfusion. 36' 42 Linko has demonstrated that the hyperkalaemia is transient, that potassium redistribution occurs rapidly, and that serum potassium concentrations measured following rapid transfusion events (>90 ml. min -~) have returned to normal, baseline values. 36 A number of conclusions may be drawn from these reports. A sustained rate of blood transfusion greater than 90 ml. min -~ is probably required to produce clinically important hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The hyperkalaemia is transient but will produce characteristic ECG changes and if extreme (>9 mmol-L -t) can produce lethal myocardial toxicity. Hypothermia, shock and acidosis are likely to enhance hyperkalaemic toxicity, are often present in patients requiring such massive transfusions and contribute to the high mortality. 35\"37 It is recommended that the EGG be monitored closely in such circumstances and if hyperkalaemia occurs, that it be treated aggressively. There are no good data to support the routine use of calcium supplements during or following massive transfusion.",

This \"transfusion effect\" led to the widespread practice of deliberate preoperative transfusion of kidney transplant recipients. Although graft survival was increased about 20% by this manoeuvre, some patients did become immunized to their designated organ and were unable to be transplanted. 55 Over the last decade the benefit of blood transfusion before transplant has become steadily less demonstrable and this is primarily because of improved graft survival in non-transfused patients. 56-s This is presumed to be related to the widespread use of the immunosuppressant agent, cyclosporine-A, after organ transplantation.

Subsequent reports have noted poorer outcomes in patients who have been transfused perioperatively and have undergone surgery for cancers of the lung, breast and colon and metastatic cancer of the colon. 48'~-~8 Studies in which multivariate analysis was employed to reduce the likelihood that a confounding variable, rather than blood transfusion, was responsible for the earlier cancer recurrence and which demonstrated an effect of blood transfusion on adverse outcome are presented in Table III . 4s'to-6s In these studies blood transfusion was linked to earlier recurrence of cancer independent of: duration of surgery; histological tumour stage; tumour location; level of preoperative anaemia; and age. However, caution must be exerted in the interpretation of multivariate analyses in which a high degree of intercorrelation among variables exists. The question whether blood transfusion is a surrogate marker for one or more clinical factors predisposing to tumour recurrence remains unanswered. For example, preoperative anaemia, a state likely to result in an increased requirement for perioperative blood transfusion, is independently associated with a decreased five-year survival rate. 6~ Transfusion is associated with longer operations, higher blood loss and lesser preoperative haemoglobin concentrations. 62' 69 Thus, transfusion cannot be termed an independent variable in predicting recurrence risk in such circumstances. Not all studies have reported an increased incidence of adverse outcomes following blood transfusion 63\"7~176 and in some studies there were different outcomes registered among subgroups within the study populations. 6s' 8~ Adjuvant therapy was more often given to patients with breast cancers who had been transfused and these patients had more advanced disease than those patients who were not transfused. 68 Increased recurrence rates in patients with high grade sarcomas were seen only in those transfused patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy as well. s~ The increased use of adjuvant chemotherapy in these subgroups may imply either higher grade or more extensive tumours and again this may be the relevant variable predicting outcome, rather than the blood transfusion per se. Patients with colorectal, cervical or prostatic cancers who received three or less units of packed red cells had similar outcomes to patients receiving no blood transfusions. 82 Both groups had better outcomes than those patients, with similar cancers, who had received more than four units of packed red cells or even one unit of whole blood. Patients with Duke's B or C colorectal carcinoma who received plasma-containing blood products, either whole blood or plasma, had an increased rate of recurrence compared with patients receiving either no blood or packed red cells. 83 Administration of red cells alone did not appear to confer a higher risk of recurrence than no blood transfusion.",

In fact, it would require the calcium contained in the equivalent of 900 ml of Ringer's lactate (RL) to saturate the citrate present in a unit of packed red cells, an amount of crystalloid far in excess of that used clinically to dilute packed cells (100-200 ml) .~16 Edwards reported that blood-RL solutions containing up to 70-90% RL by volume developed clot only after 45 min at 37 ~ C. TM Parlow demonstrated that blood-RL mixes have to be greater than 70% RL by volume before clot formation occurs and that it takes 30 to 60 min for clot formation.* Cull documented clot formation when blood-RL mixtures containing 50 vol% or greater of RL were made but noted that 15 minutes or more were required for clot formation. There was no clot formation for more than two hours if less than 50 vol% of RL was contained in the final mixture. It can be concluded from the available data that there is an increased likelihood for clot formation if RL is used as a diluent compared with normal saline. This clot formation is most likely to be seen when the final blood-crystalloid mixture contains more than 50 vol% of RL and will require 15-120 minutes to become manifest. Little clot formation can be expected in the setting of rapid transfusion when less than 1:1 ratios of blood:crystalloid are used. Use of normal saline as a diluent will result in no measurable clot formation. The residual blood in the intravenous set following transfusion could form clot ifRL is subsequently infused through the same set. 113 Flushing the system with a volume of normal saline sufficient to clear the system or changing the intravenous set after blood administration effectively eliminates the problem of clot formation. 113 Finally, there is no evidence that the clot formation that occurs when RL is used as a diluent for red cells results in any pathophysiological sequelae in patients during or after the transfusion.",

This is very different from the shocked and bleeding patient receiving 20 units of packed cells over 60-90 minutes. If this transfusion occurs with cold stored blood, energy expenditures as great as 300 kcal may be required to maintain normothermia.

            "text": "Iserson and Huestis have recently reviewed current techniques of blood warming to which the reader is referred (Table V) . TM Although they do not recommend the use of warmers for routine, minor transfusions (1-2 units) on the ward or in the operating room, they encourage the use of warmers for all more intensive transfusion events. However, because heat loss in the operating room is a multifactoral problem, any and every effort should be made to conserve patient energy and maintain normal body temperature. ~22 For this reason, this author recommends the use of blood warming techniques even for minor (1-2 units) intraoperative blood transfusions. Maintaining normothermia reduces the incidence of postoperative shivering thermogenesis and although, for most patients, this will be little more than an unpleasant postoperative experience, in some it can cause morbidity. 122 A problem in the preoperative care of the traumatized patient is that blood warmers are often not used during the early resuscitative phase, the result being that the patients arrive in the operating theatre already hypothermic. A technique of mixing cold stored blood with warmed (45-70 ~ C) saline has been described that allows for rapid wanning of stored blood and requires only an incubator to warm and store the saline. 123-125 Saline temperatures as high as 70 ~ have been demonstrated to be safe, not only with respect to red cell integrity but also with respect to the final temperature of the admixture. Saline temperatures greater than 70 ~ result in increased osmotic fragility and higher supernatant concentrations of both free haemoglobin and potassium. An advantage of the saline admixture technique is that the use of an in-line warmer is not required and thus very high flow rates may be achieved even without the use of a high capacity blood wanner. This makes the technique ideal for the early resuscitative phase of trauma patient care. Further, the fact that no equipment or set-up is required means that this technique can be rapidly established and used on multiple patients in a busy emergency room without significantly increasing team efforts. In situations where lesser flow rates are adequate, Zorko has described a technique of saline admixture where the cold stored blood is mixed with saline warmed only to 45 ~ C, then passed through an in-line wanner.lZ~ The end-product is nearly normothermic, being warmer than blood that has been either admixed or passed through an in-line heater and achieving a higher flow rate than blood that has not been admixed. Whatever the technique employed, it is clearly advantageous to warm all stored blood either before or during transfusion. As the magnitude of the transfusion event increases, blood warming may move from being desirable to being lifesaving.",

            "text": "~4 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION Blood banks discouraged blood donation from individuals at high risk for the acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS) in 1983 and, in 1985, following identification of HIV, began screening for the virus. Although there are 3,345 cases of transfusion-associated AIDS in the United States, excluding haemophiliacs (Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, April 30, 1990) and 226 in Canada, 27 since the implementation of HIV-1 screening there have been only 14 cases of transfusion-associated AIDS in the United States. 2~ The National Office of the Canadian Red Cross Society is aware of two possible HIV seroconversions associated with transfusions (personal communication, National Office, Canadian Red Cross Society). This must be measured against the 15 million blood and blood products transfused since the implementation of HIV screening in Canada. Ward investigated 13 patients, seropositive for HIV, who had received blood from seven donors screened as seronegative for HIV at the time of donationfl The seven donors were found to be infected with HIV on subsequent testing. Six of the seven donors reported risk factors for HIV infection and five had engaged in high risk activities within four months of their HIV-seronegative donation. Ward concluded that these donors had been infected only recently before donation, were seronegative at the time of donation and seroconverted thereafter. It was further concluded that the reasons for deferral of donation need to be communicated more effectively to blood donors who are at high risk for HIV infection. Based on the incidence of HIV antibody of 0.012% in repeat donors and 0.04% in first time donors (USA) and an eight week incubation period for development of HIV antibody, Ward estimated that the rate of HIV transmission by seronegative blood would be 26 instances per million transfusions. 2s This estimate is much larger than the number of reported cases of HIV infection linked to seronegative blood transfusion at this time. For comparison, the incidence of HIV-seropositive blood donations in Canada (1990-91) was 0.004% of donated units (personal communication, National Office, Canadian Red Cross Society).",
