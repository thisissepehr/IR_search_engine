However, in many cases, such cryptic species are undetectable by systematists dealing only with morphological characters (Mayr & Ashlock 1991) .",

This approach, coupled with various population genetic models, is an especially powerful tool for the elucidation of non-random reproductive systems, and thus is most useful in detecting sympatric cryptic species that may not be revealed by examining variation in morphological characters, or in maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA markers.",

These entities, while genetically strongly differentiated from each other, exhibited extreme morphological similarity, sharing all of the character states that have been regarded as diagnostic of G. hokouensis . In this paper, we document this extreme example of discrepancy between morphological and genetic divergences, and discuss its taxonomic and evolutionary implications. 6, Nago; 7, Nakagusuku; 8, Chinen; 9, Agunijima; 10, Tokashikijima; 11, Akajima; 12, Tonakijima; 13, Kumejima; 14, Yamagawa; 15, Kuchinoshima; 16, Amamioshima; 17, Ishigakijima; 18, Taipei.

Specimens from each island, except those from Okinawajima, were treated as a single sample on the basis of the assumption that individuals occurring on a small island belong to a single interbreeding population. Because of the large size of Okinawajima (1.192 km 2 ), groups of specimens collected from five localities within this island (each <3 km \u00d7 3 km) were designated as five separate samples for the analysis. Five other samples of G. hokouensis , representing populations from southern Kyushu, the northern Ryukyus, the Amami Group of the central Ryukyus, the southern Ryukyus and Taiwan, were also examined for comparisons ( Fig. 1, Table 1 ).",

Heterozygotes were completely absent in these samples at six to eight loci, despite the presence of two kinds of homozygotes in each. Based on the differential patterns of alleles possessed at these loci, individuals in each of the four samples were grouped into two subsamples without any conflict: no individuals possessed a combination of alleles characteristic to both subsamples simultaneously, and genotype frequencies in each subsample satisfied Hardy-Weinberg expectations at all polymorphic loci. We thus considered these subsamples as corresponding to actual randomly mating populations and treated them separately in further analyses, designated by a '1' or '2' following the locality names.",

Due to remarkable allele frequency differences at many loci, the samples and subsamples from the nine islands of the Okinawa Group could be unequivocally classified into two groups. Of these, one, henceforth referred to as Group 1, consisted of 12 samples and subsamples, Iheyajima-1 (locality number 1 in Fig. 1 ), Izenajima-1 (2), Iejima (3), Katsu-u (5), Nago (6), Nakagusuku (7), Chinen (8), Agunijima (9), Tokashikijima (10), Akajima (11), Tonakijima-1 (12) and Kumejima-1 (13), all of which were characterized by possessing predominant alleles 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'a' and 'a or c' at Ada , Acoh-2 , Est , Gda , Idh-1 , Idh-2 , Mpi , Pnp , Pep-lgg and Pgm-1 , respectively. The other, Group 2, consisted of five samples and subsamples, Iheyajima-2 (1), Izenajima-2 (2), Benoki (4), Tonakijima-2 (12) and Kumejima-2 (13), characterized by the predominant alleles 'a', 'b', 'e and f ', 'b', 'b', 'e', 'd', 'd', 'c' and 'd' at the above loci, respectively. Thus, two sympatric subsamples from each of the four islands were assigned to different groups. Samples from outside of the Okinawa Group (i.e. those from Yamagawa, Kuchinoshima, Amamioshima, Ishigakijima and Taipei: locality numbers 14 -18) showed allele frequencies similar to those of Group 1 at the above loci. Prominent genetic differences between the Group 1 and 2 samples and subsamples were also reflected by fairly large values of Nei's genetic distance ( D ), ranging from 0.489 ( Katsu-u vs. Tonakijima-2) to 0.654 ( Izenajima-1 vs. Izenajima-2) ( x -= 0.567) ( Table 4 ). On the other hand, D values obtained within each group were fairly small (as small as, or smaller than, 0.052 for Group 1 and 0.083 for Group 2). D values between the Group 2 samples and the samples from five other regions were considerably large (0.486-0.631,",

This indicates that the two entities occur syntopically, at least in part, on these islands and thus potentially have chances to interbreed under natural conditions. Thus, we can safely conclude that certain reproductive isolation mechanisms have been established between the two entities and that they actually represent separate biological species. On Okinawajima, the two species were collected from separate localities: a Group 2 sample was obtained exclusively from Benoki, the northern part, whereas Group 1 samples derived from the middle ( Nago and Katsu-u) and southern (Nakagusuku and Chinen) parts (see Fig. 1 ). The northern part of Okinawajima is more humid and mountainous with evergreen broad-leaf forest being the predominant vegetation, whereas the middle and southern parts are drier and relatively flat with more open vegetation. It is thus probable that the two species have segregated on this large island on the basis of their habitat preferences.",

However, such a tendency was not evident in Tonakijima, where the two species were observed in nearly equal frequencies in both forest and open habitats. Tonakijima is much smaller (3.5 km 2 ) than Iheyajima (20.6 km 2 ) and Kumejima (58.4 km 2 ), and thus may not be large enough for the two geckos to segregate their habitats.",

These results suggest that populations of 'Gekko hokouensis' in other regions of the East Asian islands are conspecific with the Okinawan Group 1 populations, and that the species represented by the Group 2 populations is geographically restricted to the Okinawa Group. Gekko hokouensis was originally described from Hok'ou (= Yanshan), Jiangxi Province, eastern continental China ( Pope 1928; Zhao & Adler 1993) (Fig. 1) . We have no direct information at present regarding the relationships among the present two cryptic species in the East Asian islands and the typical G. hokouensis due to the lack of available continental samples. As far as the currently available information is concerned, however, it is most likely that the species having a much broader range over the East Asian islands including Taiwan on the continental shelf (i.e. that represented by the Group 1 populations) also occurs in eastern continental China. Therefore, we tentatively regard the species represented by Group 1 as the nominotypical species and the other as a possible undescribed species endemic to the Okinawa Group. More extensive allozyme surveys incorporating the continental samples, along with detailed morphological comparisons, are strongly desired to resolve the taxonomic problem raised by the above results.",

This seems to negate the probability of their recent divergence from each other. On the other hand, the two species are seemingly identical externally, sharing a suite of character states diagnostic of G. hokouensis (see above). Similar examples of apparent morphological identity between genetically divergent species have been reported for other groups of reptiles (Good et al. 1996; Sadlier et al. 1999) . Such a situation is attributable to the long parallel retention of primitive character states, or otherwise to independent acquisitions of derived states (i.e. convergence) (Mayr & Ashlock 1991) . Further phylogenetic analyses of the relationships of these and other congeneric species, and the mapping of relevant character states on the resultant phylogenetic tree, will clarify which of these evolutionary phenomena is responsible for the remarkable external similarity of such genetically divergent entities.",
