            "text": "Lean manufacturing philosophy and associated business practices have been widely embraced and deployed by global enterprises. Some estimates assert that the shift to JIT scheduling in the US automotive industry has saved companies more than $1 billion a year in inventory costs, alone. While lean manufacturing has substantially boosted operational efficiency, it has also left enterprises operating in an increasingly risk-encumbered environment. Capacity disruptions triggered by forces of nature, property-and process-related hazards, and man-made interventions have proven to be the most profound influence on enterprise risk. As evidenced in 1995, an earthquake hit the port town of Kobe, Japan, razed to the ground 100,000 buildings and shut down Japan's largest port for over two years. In 1999, an earthquake in Taiwan displaced power lines to the semiconductor fabrication facilities responsible for more than 50 percent of the worldwide supplies of certain computer components, and shaved 5 percent off earnings for major hardware manufacturers including Dell, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Compaq (Wilcox 1999). In September 2002, longshoremen on the US West Coast were locked out in a labor strike for 11 days, forcing the shutdown of 29 ports. With more than $300 billion of dollars in goods shipped annually through these ports, the dispute caused between $11 and $22 billion in lost sales, spoiled perishables and underutilized capacity (Isidore 2002 (Berniker 2003) . Man-made disasters are on the rise, from terrorist attacks to computer viruses . As a result of the above events, according to a recent survey by A.M. Best Company, Inc. of 600 executives, 69 percent of chief financial officers, treasurers and risk managers at Global 1,000 companies in North America and Europe view property-related hazards-such as fires and explosions--and supply chain disruptions as the leading threats to top revenue sources (A.M. Best Company 2006).",

            "text": "One of the most common types of disruption appearing in the literature is that of supply rate changes. An excellent work by Arreola-Risa & DeCroix (1998) explores inventory management of stochastic demand systems, where the product supply is disrupted for periods of random duration. The classic economic order quantity (EOQ) problem with supply disruptions is studied by Parlar & Berkin (1991) and Parlar & Perry (1996) consider a order-quantity/ reorder-point inventory models with two suppliers subject to independent disruptions to compute the exact form of the average cost expression. Mohebbi (2003) presents an analytical model for computing the stationary distribution of the on-hand inventory in a continuous-review inventory system with compound Poisson demand, Erlang distributed lead time, and lost sales, where the supplier can assume one of the two \"available\" and \"unavailable\" states at any point in time according to a continuous-time Markov chain. Papers addressing both supply disruptions and random demand include (Chao 1987 , Parlar 1997 , Song & Zipkin 1996 . Chao (1987) J Syst Sci Syst Eng proposes a dynamic model concerning optimal inventory policies in the presence of market disruptions, which are often characterized by events with uncertain arrival time, severity and duration. Parlar (1997) considers a continuousreview stochastic inventory problem with random demand and random lead-time where supply may be disrupted due to machine breakdowns, strikes or other randomly occurring events. Song & Zipkin (1996) , explore an inventory-control model which includes a detailed Markovian model of the resupply system. A number of papers which address supply and demand changes have been developed in the field of oil stockpiling, as there has been grave concern over the oil supply from the Middle East (Teisberg 1981, Chap & Manne 1982 , Murphy et al. 1987 ). Modeling production rate disruptions (machine failures) has been largely addressed by extending classical economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) models. Rosenblatt & Lee (1986) derive an EMQ model when the production process is subject to a random deterioration from an in-control state to an out-of control state. Lee (1992) models the defect-generating process in the semiconductor wafer probe process to determine an optimal lot size, which reduces the average processing time on a critical resource. Abboud (1997) presents a simple approximation of the EMQ model with Poisson machine breakdowns and low failure rate. study an unreliable production system with constant demand and random breakdowns, with the focus on the effects of machine failure and repair on optimal lot-sizing decisions. Assuming exponentially distributed time between failures and instantaneous repair of the machine, authors derive some unique properties of their model compared to the classical EMQ model. extend their earlier work in to the case where repair times are randomly distributed and excess demand is lost. Kim & Hong (1997) propose an extension to the model in , which determines an optimal lot size when a machine is subject to random failures and the time to repair is constant. They formulate average cost functions for the optimal lot size, and derive conditions for determining the optimal lot size. Hopp et al. (1989) presents a model that assumes the (s, S) control policy. With Poisson failures and exponential repair times, a cost function is derived. Rahim (1994) presents an integrated model for determining an economic manufacturing quantity, inspection schedule and control chart design of an imperfect production process, where he assumes that the process is subject to the occurrence of a non-Markovian shock having an increasing failure rate. Among other notable examples of such works are Henig & Gerchak (1990), Bielecki & Kumar (1988) , Buzacott & Shantikumar (1993) . Finally, Abboud (2001) examines a single machine production and inventory system with a deterministic production and demand rate, when the machine is subject to random failures. The author models the production/inventory system as a Markov chain and develops an algorithm to compute the potentials that are used to formulate the cost function.",

Consider a lean (i.e., no inventory) system with a target (demand adjusted) capacity * C experiencing periodic random disruptions, each of which may render a full or partial system capacity loss. We assume that disruptions occur one at a time and that the i th occurrence results in an instantaneous loss of magnitude i C \u0394 in the remaining system capacity. Following the i th disruption at time t, the system capacity remains at level t i C C \u2212 \u0394 until the next disruption unless the remaining capacity falls below a critical level c upon which the system regains all lost capacity back to * C . For the reason of simplicity, in this paper, we assumed instantaneous recovery. The system is assumed to stochastically regenerate at points of recovery ( Figure 1 ). Capacity dynamics as such can be observed in a number of industrial scenarios including, but are not limited to, (i) shortage of repair personnel and performance degradation caused by failing equipment with a full repair upon a complete failure, (ii) non-self-announcing stepwise system failures, and (iii) gradual equipment phaseout and modernization.",

The results of this model served as a basis to analyze a two-phase strategy, where countermeasures were activated during only a fraction of a disruption cycle. For the latter model, we aimed to determine the optimal threshold when the countermeasures should be disengaged. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with analytics of the impact that countermeasure options can have on the system performance. In practice, the countermeasure options could range from purely technological solutions, such as installation of fire prevention water sprinkler systems, to non-technological decisions that could, for example, alleviate labor strikes or prevent terrorist attacks or political unrest. In this investigation, we considered two forms of the countermeasure cost functions.
