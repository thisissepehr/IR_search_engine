The evaluation of organ severity is difficult in patients considered for cannulation in a distant hospital. This study was designed to identify early factors associated with hospital mortality in ARDS patients treated with ECMO and retrieved from referring hospitals. Methods: Data from 85 consecutive ARDS patients equipped with ECMO by our mobile team and consequently admitted to our ICU were prospectively collected and analyzed. Results: The main ARDS etiologies were community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (35 %) , influenza pneumonia (23 %) (with 12 patients having been treated during the first half of the study period), and nosocomial pneumonia (14 %) . The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1) (2) (3) (4) h. ECMO was venovenous in 77 (91 %) patients. No complications occurred during transport by our mobile unit. Forty-eight patients died at the hospital (56 %). Based on a multivariate logistic regression, a score including age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia was constructed. The probability of hospital mortality following ECMO initiation was 40 % in the 0-2 score class (n = 58) and 93 % in the 3-4 score class (n = 27). Patients with an influenza pneumonia diagnosis and a SOFA score before ECMO of less than 12 had a mortality rate of 22 %. Conclusions: Age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza may be used to accurately evaluate the risk of death in ARDS patients considered for retrieval under ECMO from distant hospitals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 665, "end": 671, "text": "(35 %)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 808, "end": 814, "text": "(14 %)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 929, "end": 932, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 933, "end": 936, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 941, "end": 944, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The technique of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves placing them on a venovenous or venoarterial life-support circuit with a membrane oxygenator to temporarily take over the gas exchange and, sometimes, cardiac function [1] . Over the last two decades, the technique has progressed significantly, and several studies have reported encouraging survival rates using mainly venovenous ECMO in adults with ARDS [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Recently, an ECMO-based management protocol for selected ARDS patients transferred to a referral center was shown to improve 6-month disability-free survival [9, 10] . However, owing to recent advances in the management of ARDS [11, 12] , ECMO remains a salvage therapy in a limited number of patients with life-threatening hypoxemia or respiratory acidosis [13] . Moreover, because of its additional costs and the need for trained expertise [14, 15] , a rational allocation of this limited resource is critical, and indications must be further explored. ECMO centers have developed and have long been associated with mobile units that retrieve patients from distant hospitals immediately after cannulation [16, 17] . Approximately half of the patients treated with ECMO for ARDS are cannulated in distant hospitals and transported on ECMO [4, 18, 19] . For these patients, the decision to initiate ECMO is often made by phone and is based on the severity of respiratory failure, which is often evaluated by blood gas results or the lung injury score [20, 21] . Although some patients do not present with other organ failures, most of them present with septic shock and associated organ dysfunction. Because they may contribute significantly to ECMO outcomes, an understanding of the impact of preexisting organ dysfunction on ECMO-associated mortality is helpful in modifying the current strategies of ECMO in the resuscitation of these high-risk patients [5] . In the present study, we evaluated early prognostic factors in ARDS patients treated with ECMO in distant hospitals by our mobile team and brought to our center during a 3-year period. The goal was to establish simple decision rules that could aid the clinician in the decision regarding whether to treat patients with ECMO.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 308, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 492, "end": 495, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 496, "end": 499, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 500, "end": 503, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 504, "end": 507, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 508, "end": 511, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 512, "end": 515, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 516, "end": 519, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 680, "end": 683, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 684, "end": 687, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 750, "end": 754, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 880, "end": 884, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 964, "end": 968, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 969, "end": 972, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1237, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1365, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1369, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1373, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1577, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1581, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1982, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Marseille North Hospital is a general acute-care, university hospital.

We used centrifugal pumps (Bio-console 560; Medtronic Perfusion Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a flow of 3-5 l/min in all patients.

Briefly, RPA accepts predictor and response values as the inputs. As the output, this function generates a decision tree using a recursive partitioning algorithm. Each partitioning step selects the tree-branching criterion based on the predictor variables that will split the parent data set into two daughter data sets, with the daughter sets being as ''pure'' (homogeneous) as possible as approximated according to a heuristic. Here, purity is measured with the Gini statistic with respect to the response variable, such that the more homogeneous a daughter set, the higher the purity. Partition steps are repeated, adding branches to the tree, until the subgroups reach a minimum size or until no improvement can be obtained. Firstly, the significant variables in the multivariate logistic regression were selected into an RPA to build a decision tree. Then the optimal cutoff in the tree associated with each variable was used to transform the continuous variables into categorical variables (named partial scoreps i ). With the aim to be as intuitive as possible, the score was constructed to give a result between 0 and 4 where 0 is a lower risk of hospital mortality and 4 a higher risk. The score can be calculated with the following formula: score = P 3 1 ps i , where ps i is the partial score assigned to each categorical variable. The discriminative performance of the score was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and quantified by calculating the area under the curve and 95 % CI. The best cutoff value was identified as the point with the highest sensitivity and specificity (Youden index: SE ? SP -1).

Among them, 57 patients did not meet criteria for ECMO and were not referred and 85 consecutive patients treated with ECMO were included. Six of them had been included in a previous cohort study [4] . Patients' demographic characteristics are provided in Table 1 . No patient had a history of chronic heart, renal, or respiratory insufficiency. The main cause of ARDS was documented as communityacquired bacterial pneumonia (n = 30). Twenty patients presented with influenza pneumonia, 12 of whom had been treated in the first half of the study period. The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1-4) h; transfer to our center occurred within 6 (3-7) h. No serious complications (including vascular or chest tube displacement, ECMO malfunction, cardiac arrest, or death) occurred during transport by our mobile unit. For venovenous ECMO, femoral-jugular vein cannulation was performed in 62 patients, and femoral-femoral cannulation was performed in 15 patients. Femoral-femoral cannulation was performed in the eight patients treated with venoarterial ECMO. In all cases, venoarterial ECMO was used for left heart failure and severe shock complicating ARDS-associated disease. Prior to ECMO, all patients had refractory hypoxemia, 20 had a PaCO 2greater than 70 mmHg, and 29 had an arterial pH less than 7.2. Forty-eight patients died in the ICU or at the hospital (56 %). Causes of death were multiorgan failure frequently associated with refractory hypoxemia (n = 44); hemorrhagic complications secondary to cannulation (n = 2); and intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 2). Forty-two nonsurvivors died during therapy after a median (range) of 9 (1-53) days of ECMO, and 6 of them died after successful ECMO weaning after a median (range) of 8 (5-10) days of ECMO.

After univariate analysis, factors potentially collected before ECMO that were associated with hospital mortality were age, SOFA score, lactate level, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia ( Table 2 ). SAPS II was not considered for multivariate analysis because it could not constantly be obtained at this time and because SOFA score is easier to use at the bedside. Age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia were introduced into the logistic regression analysis, which showed that these three parameters were independently associated with hospital mortality.

This important finding suggests that ECMO should not be contraindicated on the basis of organ dysfunction in young patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 121, "end": 123, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 124, "end": 127, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 128, "end": 131, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 132, "end": 135, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 136, "end": 139, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 140, "end": 143, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 313, "end": 316, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 399, "end": 402, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 403, "end": 405, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 406, "end": 409, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We found that the SOFA score before ECMO was associated with mortality. The SOFA score is simple to calculate and has been validated as a marker of organ dysfunction and of mortality in large multicenter studies in different patient populations [36] . In a cohort of 45 patients treated with ECMO for respiratory or heart failure, Wu et al. [29] suggested the prognostic value of SOFA calculated before ECMO. Recently, Lindskov et al. [18] showed that the SOFA score calculated at day 1 after ECMO initiation was predictive of death. In this latter study, a SOFA score of 10 or less was associated with 90 % survival. In the study by Wu et al. [29] , the mean SOFA score before ECMO was 14 \u00b1 4 in ARDS patients, whereas it was 10 \u00b1 3 in our study. However, as in the study by Lindskov et al. [18] , A higher score was associated with higher hospital mortality SOFA sequential organ failure assessment Fig. 3 Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative probabilities of survival for patients with pre-ECMO score classes 0-2 (n = 58), and 3-4 (n = 27). ECMO extracorporeal membrane oxygenation SOFA was not calculated in the same way as in the present study. Notably, the Glasgow coma scale score was set arbitrarily to 2 points. No patient presented with impaired consciousness at the time of sedation in our study, resulting in a 0-point neurological score in all patients. Pappalardo et al. [19] proposed a prognostic score in patients with H1N1-associated ARDS treated with ECMO that was based on biological and clinical data similar to the data used to determine the SOFA score. More recently, Schmidt et al. [35] proposed a prognostic score in ARDS patients treated with ECMO in which SOFA had a quite similar weight to that in the present study. We found that a diagnosis of influenza-associated ARDS was associated with a better prognosis. Our 30 % mortality rate is in agreement with recent studies in patients with influenza H1N1-associated ARDS treated with ECMO [19, 37] . Our results also confirm those of previous observational studies suggesting that patients treated with ECMO for influenza pneumonia have a lower risk of death than patients presenting with other causes of ARDS [2] . However, no study had previously clearly shown a protective effect of influenza in ECMO patients. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of influenza is inconsistently confirmed but rather suspected at the time the ECMO decision is made. Therefore, this parameter cannot be taken into account in all patients when making ECMO decisions. Of note, all patients in our study who had confirmed influenza had been suspected of having influenza at ECMO initiation, and only three patients with suspected influenza were not confirmed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 245, "end": 249, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 435, "end": 439, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1389, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1969, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1973, "text": "37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2189, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 901, "end": 907, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Some studies have shown that the duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO is associated with mortality [5, 7, 34, 35] .
