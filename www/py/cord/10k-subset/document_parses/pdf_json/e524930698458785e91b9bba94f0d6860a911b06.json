IAVs cause a wide range of clinical illnesses, from relatively mild infections by seasonal strains, to acute respiratory distress during infections with highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAI). For this study, we infected A549 human lung cells with lab prototype A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), a seasonal H1N1 (RV733), the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09), or with two avian strains, an H5N1 HPAI strain or an H7N9 strain that has low pathogenicity in birds but high pathogenicity in humans. We used a newly-developed aptamer-based multiplexed technique (SOMAscan \u00ae ) to examine >1300 human lung cell proteins affected by the different IAV strains, and identified more than 500 significantly dysregulated cellular proteins. Our analyses indicated that the avian strains induced more profound changes in the A549 global proteome compared to all tested low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains. The PR8 strain induced a general activation, primarily by upregulating many immune molecules, the seasonal RV733 and pdm09 strains had minimal effect upon assayed molecules, and the avian strains induced significant downregulation, primarily in antimicrobial response, cardiovascular and post-translational modification systems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Viruses 2019, 11, 1028 2 of 16 and the pandemic H1N1 2009 strains), H2N2 and H3N2.

Several anti-viral strategies, including small molecule inhibitors and yearly re-formulated vaccines, have been developed to combat IAV, but the virus extensive genetic plasticity, caused by an error-prone polymerase and capacity to mix genetic content, often leads to resistance to virus-targeted anti-viral strategies.

The virus' genetic make-up of eight segments of single-stranded RNA allows for significant genetic plasticity. Like other RNA viruses that lack genetic proof reading, the highly errorprone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leads to a high mutation rate (=antigenic drift), and the segmented genomes allows for segment mixing during co-infections, leading to emergence of new isolates (=antigenic shift). Thus, vaccines need to be reformulated each year, and the process of attempting to anticipate future isolates often leads to vaccine mismatch [24] , which may be exacerbated by an individual\u2032s immune history [25] . A limited repertoire of anti-viral compounds that either inhibit viral uncoating or viral release, have been approved, but viral mutation quickly arises during outbreaks [26, 27] . Thus, there has been increasing interest to identify host factors that the virus may require for replication and pathogenicity to complement strategies that only target the virus.

Thus, at the time we initiated these studies, we selected an aptamer-based assay reported to reliably detect and measure more than 1000 proteins. These slow-off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers \u00ae ) were developed by SomaLogics, Inc., (Boulder, CO, USA) [18] [19] [20] , and have been used to examine cancer biomarkers [45] , Alzheimer s disease biomarkers [46] and biomarkers in IAV-infected clinical nasal secretions [47] . Our pilot studies with the first available version, capable of detecting 1128 proteins, reliably measured differences in influenza PR8-infected A549 cells over a time course. We subsequently used the next-generation SOMAscan version 1.3, which measures >1300 proteins, to measure Zika virus-induced proteomic alterations in Vero cells [23] and in U251 astrocytoma cells [48] . Application of this targeted aptamer-based approach, which was designed primarily to detect low-abundance proteins, thus provides a beneficial complementary approach to the non-biased MS-based approaches that tend to measure more abundant proteins. Comparative analyses of dysregulated proteins we identified in this study to proteins identified in one of our earlier MS-based studies [10, 34, 35] showed generally good agreement. Two proteins (ISG15 and \u03b2-2-microglobulin) were identified as upregulated by both methods, 75 proteins were determined to not be significantly regulated by both techniques and no proteins were identified as significantly upregulated by one method, but significantly downregulated by the other.

All tested virus strains affected the A549 cellular proteome, upregulating some proteins and downregulating other proteins. Although none of the 1310 measurable common cellular proteins was significantly dysregulated by all five viruses, some proteins were similarly dysregulated by multiple viruses. For example, CCL5 was upregulated by PR8, H5N1 and H7N9, and PGAM1 was significantly downregulated by pdm09, H5N1 and H7N9. The five viruses generated three overall patterns of dysregulation, at least as measured by the 1310 proteins that can be assayed by the SOMAscan. PR8 caused an overall general activation, primarily of antimicrobial inflammatory and immune response, as reflected by a large upregulation of more than a dozen proteins, including ISG15, STAT1, OAS1 and downregulation only of PPID. PR8 is a highly lab culture-adapted strain passaged multiple times in mice that is highly virulent in mice, but extremely attenuated in humans. RV733 and pdm09 had very little effect in our A549 cells, as we found in a previous quantitative MS study [13] , and are relatively low virulence, despite being well adapted to growth in humans. Both the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, which demonstrate the third pattern (significant downregulation of many more proteins than the other strains, particularly in the antimicrobial response, cardiovascular, and post-translational modification networks), and significant downregulation of many common proteins, are poorly adapted to humans because of their receptor specificity, but when successfully delivered into the lower human respiratory tract, they can be highly virulent.
