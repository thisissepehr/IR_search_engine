HeV first appeared in 1994 in Australia in horses and humans. Identification of NiV followed in 1998 in Malaysia, where it caused disease in pigs and humans. Since then, numerous outbreaks of both viruses have occurred, with evidence of human-to-human transmission and a mortality rate that approached 75% for NiV infection [2] [3] [4] [5] . For both viruses, fruit bats are considered as the natural reservoir, and spillover infection is thought to occur through contamination of food sources or direct contact with secretions from infected animals [6] . Infection of humans is characterized by a rapid and extensive spread of the virus in several organs, with symptoms including respiratory distress and encephalitis [7] . These symptoms can be reproduced by experimental infection of several animal models, including hamsters, pigs, cats, ferrets, and nonhuman primates [8] . Recently, 23 new distinct viral clades closely related to HeV and NiV have been identified in 6 bat species in 5 different African countries, thus widening significantly the geographic distribution of these viruses [9] .

Consequently, preventive vaccination remains a more suitable alternative, particularly to protect people who may be in contact with infected animals and susceptible livestock.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 85, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 360, "end": 364, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 365, "end": 369, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 370, "end": 374, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Vaccination strategies against henipavirus infection have mostly been based on repeated injections of high doses of HeV G protein mixed with adjuvants to induce a protective humoral response [13] [14] [15] .

First, AAV vectors are derived from a nonpathogenic virus, and their lack of toxicity has been documented in several preclinical and clinical studies [18, 42] . Second, the wide tropism of AAV and the existence of several AAV serotypes allow efficient gene transfer via different injection routes and in numerous, if not all animal species [43] . Finally, previous studies have suggested that a single injection of AAV vectors can result in a strong and sustained production of Ab against the transgene product [21, 22, [44] [45] [46] . The first part of our study was focused on the characterization of the AAV-induced humoral response. We found that the AAV8 vector injected intramuscularly was the most efficient for producing anti-NiV G Ab ( Figure 1A and 1C) . In both intramuscular and intradermal routes, the kinetics of anti-NiV G Ab was characterized by delayed detection 4-6 weeks after injection and by a peak production 8-12 weeks after injection. This unusual lag phase was previously documented in other studies [23, 24] and likely reflects the time required for the conversion of the single-stranded AAV vector genome into a double-stranded DNA form able to express the transgene [47] . The use of double-stranded AAV vectors, which can circumvent this rate-limiting step and accelerate the synthesis of the antigen, may improve the kinetics of Ab production. Another major characteristic of AAV-induced humoral response in mice was its detection at a high level for an extended period (Figure 1 ). Many groups have similarly documented a persistent AAV-induced humoral response [21, 45, 46] . Analysis of vector persistence and expression in transduced tissues suggested that the persistent Ab level may be due to continued expression of the transgene (Figure 2 ). In contrast, the decline in IgG levels 5 weeks after injection in hamsters could be due to reduced vector persistence in this animal species ( Figure 3A) . Future studies comparing a range of AAV doses in hamsters and mice will indicate whether these differences are linked to the host species or to the vector dose. Finally, we observed that a boost injection with an alternative AAV serotype in mice did not significantly enhance the Ab level ( Figure 1E and 1F ). In contrast, several studies have documented the possibility of boosting the AAV-induced humoral response by using an adenoviral vector [22] [23] [24] . It is possible that a booster effect could be observed only if boosting is performed at a later time, when the humoral response induced by the priming injection has declined. Additional studies should also be performed to determine whether these observations can be transposed to other animal species.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 236, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 593, "end": 597, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 598, "end": 601, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 607, "end": 611, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 612, "end": 616, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1116, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1281, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1684, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2466, "end": 2470, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2475, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2476, "end": 2480, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 828, "end": 845, "text": "Figure 1A and 1C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1592, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1859, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2006, "end": 2016, "text": "Figure 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2326, "text": "Figure 1E and 1F", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In the second part of our study, we analyzed whether a single AAV injection was sufficient to protect the animals against a lethal challenge with henipaviruses.

So far, only few vaccination studies reported the ability to induce sterilizing immunity. In particular, variable results were obtained using a soluble HeV G protein, suggesting that only high, repeated doses of the antigen, coupled with adjuvants, may completely prevent virus replication [12] [13] [14] [15] . The induction of sterilizing immunity after a single AAV injection may reflect a unique contribution made by this vaccine approach, which certainly deserves future investigations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 810, "end": 814, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 815, "end": 819, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 820, "end": 824, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 825, "end": 829, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 246, "text": "Figure 3C", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 293, "end": 302, "text": "Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 313, "end": 322, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 327, "end": 334, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 429, "end": 438, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "NiV and HeV G proteins are 83% homologous [48, 49] . This level of homology suggests that a cross-neutralizing response can be induced. Accordingly, Ab against the HeV G protein have been reported to cross-neutralize NiV [37, 38, 50] . In contrast, the NiV G protein is considered unable to induce an efficient cross-protective response in vivo. This notion is mostly supported by in vitro neutralization assays showing that anti-NiV G Ab do not efficiently neutralize HeV. However, the potential cross-protective effect of anti-NiV G responses against HeV has not been evaluated so far. In this study, we observed that 50% of the animals vaccinated with AAV-NiV.G survived after a challenge with HeV ( Figure 3D ). This interesting result suggests that a low level of cross-neutralizing Ab against HeV not detectable by the neutralization assay (Table 2 ) may be induced after vaccination. Alternatively, it is possible that protection is conferred by the cell-mediated immune response. Even though cellular responses against henipavirus glycoproteins have not been characterized so far, cellular and particularly CD8 + T-cell responses may be induced and play a role in protecting the animals. Accordingly, induction of an adaptive T-helper 1 immune response against NiV G was suggested to occur following injection of canarypox virus vectors encoding NiV G in pigs [17] . Interestingly, intramuscular injection of AAV8-NiV.G induced a dominant IgG2a response in mice and hamsters that was not observed with other AAV serotypes nor via the intradermal route ( Figure 1C and 1D ). This result suggests that this capsid serotype may induce an anti-NiV G T-helper 1-oriented immune response. A challenge performed at earlier time points or adoptive transfer of T cells should indicate the extent to which cellular responses against NiV G can protect against viral infection. These studies should include the AAVrh32.33 serotype, which was selected for its ability to induce a qualitatively and quantitatively superior cellular response [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 42, "end": 46, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 47, "end": 50, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 221, "end": 225, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 226, "end": 229, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 230, "end": 233, "text": "50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1372, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2039, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 703, "end": 712, "text": "Figure 3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 846, "end": 854, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1578, "text": "Figure 1C and 1D", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Together, our results demonstrate that AAV vectors constitute a powerful genetic platform for the in vivo expression of henipavirus antigens that can be used to further explore the immunological basis of anti-henipavirus vaccines and to develop new prophylactic strategies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/).
