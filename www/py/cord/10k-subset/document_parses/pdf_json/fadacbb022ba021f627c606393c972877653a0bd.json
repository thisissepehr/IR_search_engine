The design of this teflon-coated, aluminum device resembles the 96-well layout of the disposable variety of tissue culture microplates. The reusable, hard microplate has been specifically developed to hold and evaporate volatile organic solvents from aliquots of crude sample extractions or partitions intended for testing in various in vitro biological screening assays. This device is a valuable adjunct for converting numerous small volumes of nonpolar or nonaqueous dissolved compounds into reconstituted solutions containing acceptable assay solvents.",

Aqueous solubility notwithstanding, there is an added concern that many of the carrier solvents may be cytotoxic to the cell lines or primary cell cultures utilized in some of the assays. Moreover, there are often limitations of time or objective imposed by individual small scale extractions for large numbers of samples into more aqueous solvents. Re-extraction into more appropriate solvents is an extra effort and reduces screening efficiency and may also change the profile of compounds in a sample from its counterpart screened in another assay system. Therefore, in vitro screening among different types of assay systems may require, on occasion, special sample preparation to facilitate its delivery to the target cells of that assay. This is especially true in an assay where the sample loading technique cannot utilize filter-paper disks to evaporate the carrier solvent before sample addition.",

            "text": "Plant or animal materials are often homogenized in organic solvents to extract nonpolar compounds. These extracts, or partitions of extracts, are typically in volatile solvent systems such as methanol-toluene or methanol. The cell lines or primary tissue cultures used in many in vitro biological screening assays often cannot tolerate these types of delivery solvents. As a compromise to maintain solubility, but to reduce cytotoxicity of the extracting solvent, we replace the carrier solvent with a more polar or aqueous or both delivery solvent (e.g., ethanol, dimethyl-sulfoxide, or aqueous medium). Time is saved by reconstituting many different samples at once, just before beginning the assay. Aliquots of these samples are then transferred to a disposable microplate directly, or from dilutions, to the assay. The solvent-resistant, multiwell, hard microplate is reusable, can be autoclaved, and is inexpensive to make. It is a one-piece, Teflon-coated aluminum plate, 3.22 X 4.88 X 0.75 in. (L X W X D), and in the same general format as any standard 96-well microplate. The depth of the hard microplate may vary to meet individual requirements for well volumes. The 96-well format of the hard microplate is convenient for making sample dilutions or simple transfers to other disposable microplates. However, the layout itself may be changed to accommodate the larger volume designs of the 60-, 24-, 12-or 6-well series of microplates. This multiwell, hard microplate is most easily cleaned by washing with water and then flushing with alcohol {cotton swabs can be used to remove bits of residual material). A cleaned hard microplate may also be wrapped in aluminum foil and autoclaved before use.",

Because of the nature of the solvents that might be used during this process, a fume hood is recommended for all stages.",
