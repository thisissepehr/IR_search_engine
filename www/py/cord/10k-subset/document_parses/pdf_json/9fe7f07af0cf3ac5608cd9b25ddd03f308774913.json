The diagnosis of acute sinusitis was confirmed by radiography and sinus puncture. Elevated antibody titres were found in 102 patients (33 %). A four fold or greater titre rise was detected in 21.5 %, and a high stable titre suggestive of recent viral infection was present in a further 11.5 %. Adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounted for most of the elevated antibody titres. Elevated titres were found in 79 (32 %) of the 245 patients with purulent maxillaw sinusitis (pathogenic bacteria isolated in sinus secretion) and in 23 (35 %) of the 65 patients with non-purulent sinusitis (no pathogenic bacteria isolated). About 90 % of the fourfold or greater titre rises in baeteriologicaUy negative cases were due to adeno-or influenza viruses. A fourfold rise in antibody titre was also found in 7 of 101 control patients (7%). The results of this study suggest that respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae may be potential etiological agents in acute maxillary sinusitis, either alone or in combination with the common bacterial pathogens of sinusitis.",

            "text": "Acute sinusitis usually follows a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. The mucosal response to viral attack causes a disturbance in maxillary ostial function, which in turn leads to impaired sinus ventilation and drainage and, eventually, to the establishment of clinical maxillary sinusitis (1, 2) . A viral infection is thought to impair several local and general defence mechanisms (3, 4) . Thus, deterioration of ciliary motility (5, 6) , damage to ciliated cells and, at a later stage, massive destruction of the epithelium may occur as a result of viral insult (7, 8) . These adverse effects may also be caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9) , although mycoplasmas have not been isolated from sinus secretions (10) . The impairment of the host defences facilitates bacterial establishment and secondary colonization of the maxillary sinuses. However, results of bacteriological culture of the aspirated sinus secretion are negative in a considerable percentage of sinusitis cases, varying from 18 to 50 % in different studies (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , and it seems plausible that at least part of these sinus infections could be due to respiratory viruses, Mycoplasrna pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. We therefore decided to study the possible etiological role of viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chtamydia spp. which commonly cause acute upper respiratory infections, in acute maxillary sinusitis. Paired sera from acute maxillary sinusitis patients and controls were tested for changes in complementfixing titres of antibodies to the above-mentioned microorganisms.",

One drawback of the CF technique is that it is not suitable for detection of rhino-and coronaviruses. These organisms can only be detected by direct culture or antigen demonstration methods, which were not emplyoed in the present study. Thus, the involvement of these two important groups of respiratory viruses was not recognized in the present series of patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. Antibodies measurable by the CF technique develop only after a latency period of one to two weeks, and a rise in antibody titre is therefore usually detectable when the patient seeks medical advice three to seven days after the onset of symptoms. A fourfold or greater rise in antibody titre between paired sera is commonly used as indicative of a recent viral infection (20, 21) . In the present study, the proportion of patients with such a rise in antibody titre was 21.5 % in the patient group and 7 % in the control group. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.0I).",

In the present study, part of the patients had respiratory symptoms for almost three weeks when the first serum sample was collected, and thus it may be assumed that a significant rise in serum antibodies had already occurred and a further fourfold rise could no longer be demonstrated. Comparison with antibody titre values in the control group indicated that high titres above certain values could be considered suggestive of a recent viral infection in the patients with acute maxillary sinusitis (Table 2) , although the requirement of a fourfold rise was not met. In all, significant antibody titres were thus recorded in 102 or 33 % of all patients, consisting of a fourfold or greater rise in 21.5 % and a high stable antibody titre in 11.5 %.",

A rise of antibody titres has been reported in 0-58 % of patients (22-24; Table  3 ). A fourfold titre rise was usually used as indication of viral infection, but in the study by Saito et al. (22) , for instance, antibodies were measured in a single serum sample in most of the patients and a titre of i> 128 was considered indicative of a recent infection by parainfiuenza viruses. Virus isolation in tissue cultures has been reported in a few studies; viruses have been detected in 4.5-15 % of the cases (24) (25) (26) (27) . In a part of these cases pathogenic bacteria were also isolated from the affected sinus (26, 27) .",

Mycoplasma pneurnoniae has not been cultured from sinus secretions (10, 24) . In the literature there is only one report of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies in a patient with acute maxillary sinusitis (23) . In the present study, 10.5 % of the patients had a fourfold titre rise or a high titre of serum antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, suggesting that this organism may be a more common etiological agent in acute sinusitis than previously thought. As a rule, both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial viruses occurred in combination with another microbe. Comparison of bacteriological findings and antibody titres did not indicate that any given bacterial pathogen was more frequently associated with a viral or mycoplasmal infection than other pathogens, nor was there any indication that a certain virus or mycoplasma had a tendency to occur in combination with a particular bacterium.",
