Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, blood sampling for IgM measurement was done within the first 24 hours from diagnosis in 332 critically ill patients; in 83 patients this was repeated upon progression to more severe stages. Among these 83 patients, 30 patients with severe sepsis progressed into shock and IgM was monitored daily for seven consecutive days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 55 patients and stimulated for IgM production. Results: Serum IgM was decreased in septic shock compared to patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and patients with severe sepsis. Paired comparisons at distinct time points of the sepsis course showed that IgM was decreased only when patients deteriorated from severe sepsis to septic shock. Serial measurements in these patients, beginning from the early start of vasopressors, showed that the distribution of IgM over time was significantly greater for survivors than for non-survivors. Production of IgM by PBMCs was significantly lower at all stages of sepsis compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: Specific changes of circulating IgM occur when patients with severe sepsis progress into septic shock. The distribution of IgM is lower among non-survivors.",

Under normal conditions, CD4 lymphocytes orchestrate B lymphocyte responses for the secretion of the polyvalent immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies that are of crucial importance for the opsonization and the subsequent rapid clearance of the invading microorganisms [3] .

It opsonizes bacteria and primes phagocytosis by neutrophils; it binds and inactivates endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria and exotoxins of Gram-positive cocci; and it also binds and inactivates proinflammatory host mediators like cytokines. Its role is underscored by models of experimental sepsis in mice; survival is prolonged after induction of sepsis through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) within the animals that possess the highest potential for IgM-primed phagocytosis [16] . Recent data coming both from rodents and humans suggest that release of IgM is primed by a new subset of B lymphocytes known as IRA (innate response activator) B cells. These cells belong to the innate defense system, they contain large cytoplasmic stores of IgM antibodies and they are the main effectors of the rapid release of IgM. IRA B cells are depleted in experimental sepsis and this leads to early death [17] . The evidence coming from experimental animal data may help explain the importance of the ex vivo production of IgM from our patient population. All patients produced much lower IgM than healthy volunteers; this defect was exaggerated in septic shock. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that during severe sepsis lymphocytes are hypofunctional for IgM production but high circulating IgM compensates for the patient's needs; once septic shock develops circulating IgM is fully consumed and lymphocytes are completely anergic for any IgM production.",
