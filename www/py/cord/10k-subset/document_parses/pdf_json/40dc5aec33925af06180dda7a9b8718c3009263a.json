Recent studies, however, have shown that high molecular weight RNA can be extracted with 1% SDS (10, 11) . We therefore extracted RNA from [*H]uridine-labeled MH virions with phenol/chloroform as well as 1 % SDS, and RNA's obtained by both methods were compared by sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3A , the extraction with 1% SDS yielded a major component of 50S and two minor components of 35S and 25S. The phenol/chloroform extraction also produced these components but the yield of 50S component was somewhat lower (Fig. 3B) . When the 50S component obtained with 1 % SDS was further treated with phenol/chloroform, a part of it was converted to 35S and 25S (Fig. 3Q . Thus the 50S component probably represents complete genome, and the 35S and 25S are fragments produced during the extraction procedures. However, it remains to be determined whether the 50S component is a con-tinuous single-stranded molecule or a complex consisting of several subunits.",

Tn this experiment, 50S, 35S, and 25S RNA were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and used for poly(A) preparation. The results (Table I) showed that poly(A) from each RNA was adenine-rich: 80 to 90% of the counts were associated with AMP. Small amounts of labeled UMP, CMP, and GMP were also found, but most of them probably arose from contaminants. It is also possible, however, that some of them originated from the 3'-end of poly(A). If so, poly(A) may be located at an internal region of MH virion RNA. Alternatively, the poly(A) stretch may also contain a few nucleotides other than adenylate at random positions; in this case ribonuclease digestion of the RNA would yield heterogeneous sizes of poly(A) (see below).",

            "text": "The existence of poly(A) in MH virion RNA is of interset in relation to the classification of coronaviruses. Recently, Baltimore (13) has proposed a scheme for classifing animal viruses based on their mode of gene expression. Following this classification of RNA animal viruses, Shatkin (14) has considered some aspects of their genome structure in relation to their mechanism to gene expression. Class 1 virions (picornaviruses and arboviruses) and class 4 virions (RNA tumor viruses), according to Shatkin's designation, whose genomes have the same polarity as virus-specific mRNA, contains poly(A) linked to genome RNA {14). As MH virion RNA contains poly(A), coronaviruses could belong either to class 1 or to class 4. They should perhaps be included in the former class rather than the latter for the following reasons: 1) they are not oncogenic as far as is known (<S) and 2) their replication is insensitive to actinomycin D (8) . Further studies on their genome structure and function are required, however. Garwes et al. (77) has recently suggested that the genome of coronaviruses, like that of RNA tumor viruses, might be a high-molecular-weight complex held together by RNA-RNA interactions. However, further studies are required to establish the structure of the coronavirus genome, since the high-molecular-weight RNA they obtained was only extracted with 1 % SDS, which would not remove contaminating ribonuclease (77), and therefore the results of their heat denaturation experiments cannot be simply explained in terms of the dissociation of an RNA complex. In this connection, we wish to emphasize the significance of our finding that the high-molecular-weight RNA (50S) can be extracted from MH virions with phenol/chloroform, a strong deprotenizing agent. It will be of interest to investigate whether the 50S RNA is dissociated into smaller RNA's after de-naturation procedures. Also, it will be important to test the 50S RNA for infectivity, as the genome of class 1 virions, but not that of class 4 virions, is known to be infectious under appropriate conditions (14) .",
