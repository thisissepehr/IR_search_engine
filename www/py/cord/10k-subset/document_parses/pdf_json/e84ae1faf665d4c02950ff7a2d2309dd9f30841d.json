The most common respiratory viruses in infancy are respiratory syncytial (RS) viruses -they cause approximately 50% of all wheezing illness, and 80% of cases of bronchiolitis (1) . Indeed, 70% of children have been infected with RS virus by 1 year of age, and almost all by 3 years. In older children, rhinoviruses are the major virus type and cause around 60% of acute respiratory illnesses (2) . Influenza viruses occur in epidemics, the frequency and severity of which are determined by the degree of antigenic drift, and more rarely in pandemics associated with more major antigenic shift. Illness can vary from mild upper respiratory infection to severe lung infections with high mortality. Para-influenza viruses infect all age groups and are particularly associated with croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) in young children.

Another recent, possibly important candidate for a role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced asthma is the related cytokine IL-11, Several viruses, including RS and parainfluenza viruses and rhinovirus, strongly stimulated production of IL-11 by stromal cells. Furthermore, it was detected in nasal aspirates from children with URI, and its levels correlated with clinically detectable wheezing (71). Since overexpression of IL-11 in airways has been shown to produce airway inflammation, airway wall thickening, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (72), the induction of this cytokine by virus infections suggests that it may play an important role in virus-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 294, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 381, "end": 385, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of induction of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma exacerbations"}, {"text": "The degree of redundancy among cytokine functions may suggest that even if one important molecule's functions can be blocked, another related molecule may fulfil a similar role, thereby rendering a treatment aimed at one specific molecule ineffective.

These in vitro data suggest that inhibition of NFKB might suppress rhinovirus induction of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and therefore reduce the severity of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. Similar data also indicate an important role for NFKB in RS virus induction of IL-la, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 (74, 75). However, other workers have found NFlL-6 to be required as well as NFKB (76, 77). These data suggest that inhibition of more than one transcription factor, or transcription factor family, may be required to downregulate virusinduced cytokine synthesis. Of interest is the fact that aspirin, which is known to inhibit NF/cB activation, inhibited RS virus induction of all the above cytokines in vitro (74).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 179, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of virus-induced cytokine production"}, {"text": "The potential roles of these transcription factors have been suggested by in vitro studies, but in vivo confirmation is required.

(80) used a murine model to demonstrate that RS virus infection not only produces airway hyperresponsiveness in the acute phase, but also subsequently enhances allergen sensitization, both phenomena being associated with pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration. A further recent study in mice has demonstrated that acute infection with either RS virus or influenza virus greatly enhances allergic sensitization to inhaled allergen, in association with anaphylaxis and increased specific IgGl (81).

These data suggest either that the development of bronchiolitis (as opposed to uncomplicated upper respiratory RS virus infection) with early RS virus infection is a marker for the later development of atopy and asthma, or that severe infection with RS virus leading to bronchiolitis actually plays a causal role in redirecting the immune response toward a Th2 phenotype, and contributes directly to the risk of developing asthma later in life. There are some in vitro data to support the latter hypothesis, in that responses to certain RS virus proteins can lead to the development of lung eosinophilia and Th2-type cytokine release (83).

West African children infected with wild-type measles virus during measles epidemics (producing severe illness, and therefore, presumably, marked Thl-type response) were less likely to become atopic than those that had been vaccinated with measles vaccine (presumably producing a much more mild immune response) (86) . Atopy was also less likely in Italian students seropositive for hepatitis A (87) and in Japanese children with positive delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (88). The number of older siblings was inversely related to development of atopy, presumably because of the higher number of infections circulated within larger families (85) .
