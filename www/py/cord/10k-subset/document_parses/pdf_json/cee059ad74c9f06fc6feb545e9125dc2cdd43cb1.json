            "text": "During the last 20 years, the fields of microbiology and infectious diseases have faced a paradigm shift thanks to the discovery of the complex interactions between the host, its immune system, its microbiome, and various pathogens. In fact, the development of various techniques, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, has let scientists discover the inner structure of human genetic composition. The human microbiome has been defined as the collective genome of millions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that exists on every human host. It plays an elegant mutualistic relationship with the human host from birth [1] . Specifically, the human gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of bacteria that compose a complex ecosystem known as the intestinal microbiota that has relevant implications in human health and disease, especially in the hospital setting [2] . Resident microbiota can outcompete pathogens for space, metabolites and nutrients, and can inhibit pathogens with the calibration of the host immune response. Perturbation of these mechanisms is a common starting point for infection, with antibiotic therapy representing the most common cause of microbiome dysregulation [3] .",

On the other hand, other studies have shown that the composition of the intestinal microbiota is severely affected by sepsis and its treatment, but the clinical consequences of these disturbances need to be further investigated. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the mechanisms through which gut microbiota can contribute to both susceptibility and outcome of sepsis.

            "text": "In general, the gut microbiota consists of three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. The human gut microbiota has a large variety of bacterial species-around 200 dominant species and 1000 nondominant species-and they vary across individuals. The diversity within an individual's microbiota is known as alpha diversity, whereas different composition between individuals is called beta diversity. Four phyla represent most of the microbiota members: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, the former and the latter accounting for more than 90% of the bacterial population of the colon. The bacteroidetes phylum is composed of Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that digest complex polysaccharides with the release of volatile short-chain fatty acids that regulate intestinal epithelial cell growth as well as differentiation and stimulation of the immune system. The Firmicutes phylum is composed mainly of Gram-positive bacteria that can form endospores (Clostridia class). These bacteria release butyrate, promoting intestinal epithelial health and inducing colonic T regulatory cells. However, these phyla contain clinically relevant members such as Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. that can cause sepsis and fatal outcome during intestinal dysbiosis [2] . As the composition of the gut microbiota is specific for each person, dysbiosis can be interpreted as a relative change in the composition of an individual's commensal microbiota compared with others in the community, which can be loss of beneficial microbiota, increased pathogenic microbiota or decreased microbiota variety. Several mechanisms presenting during gut barrier dysfunction can be considered both a result and a cause of sepsis development: the increased permeability of gut mucosa, tissue edema, reduced perfusion, dysregulation of tissue coagulation, shift in the gut microbiome, apoptotic damage to the mucosal epithelia, and bacterial translocation. Gut mucosal perfusion is reduced during sepsis, which produces destruction of the mucosal barrier and increased permeability [4] . Transmigration of bacteria and endotoxin can induce relevant systemic effects, inducing an immune response in the local gutassociated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which in turn activates Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and priming neutrophils, causing remote lung injury, explaining the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during sepsis [5] . The dysregulation between diverse resident bacterial populations in the gut can lead to a \"pathobiome\" that finally dysregulates the immune system [6] (Box 1). Indeed, in critically ill patients, hypoxic injury, disrupted epithelial permeability, altered gut motility, and treatment with vasopressors, parenteral nutrition, and opioids facilitate the expansion of pathobionts, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria [8] . Commonly, the gut microbiome of septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients demonstrates a loss of microbial richness and diversity, dominance of a single taxon (often a potential pathogen), and loss of site specificity with isolation of the same organism at multiple sites [9] . The duration of ICU dysbiosis, the clinical impact of dysbiosis, and phenotypes of critically ill patients more prone to develop it are all aspects that need to be clarified.",

Analysis of the gut microbiota in this model demonstrated that the Western diet alone led to loss of Bacteroidetes, increased Proteobacteria, and had evidence of antibiotic resistance development even before antibiotics were administered.

Western diet mice also had an increased frequency of neutrophils, some with an \"aged\" phenotype, in the blood during sepsis compared with standard fiber-rich mice. Importantly, they found that the Western diet-dependent increase in sepsis severity and higher mortality was independent of the microbiome, suggesting that the diet may be directly regulating the innate immune system through an unknown mechanism [12] . This preclinical observation has been confirmed by some limited clinical studies in which patients who developed sepsis showed an altered microbiota pattern at baseline. In a recent study, differences in the gut microbiota and plasma LPS level were evaluated in 32 patients who underwent splenectomy and 42 healthy individuals. The splenectomy group was divided into three subgroups according to the length of their postoperative time. Significant differences were observed in gut microbiota composition measured by 16s rRNA gene sequencing with regard to the relative bacterial abundances of 2 phyla, 7 families, and 15 genera. The LPS level was significantly higher in the splenectomy group than in healthy controls and was negatively associated with five bacterial families with low abundance in the splenectomy group. Interestingly, the degree of gut microbiota alteration increased with the length of the postoperative time [13] . Similarly, a seminal study showed that patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who developed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis had a five-to ninefold increased risk of bloodstream infection and sepsis [14] . These observations were confirmed by a retrospective cohort study including over 10,000 elderly patients in the United States and showing that dysbiosis was associated with a more than threefold increased incidence of a subsequent hospitalization for sepsis [15] . Expanding on these findings, Baggs et al. recently showed that exposure to longer durations of antibiotics, additional classes of antibiotics and broader-spectrum antibiotics during hospitalization were each associated with dose-dependent increases in the risk of subsequent sepsis. This association was not found for other causes of hospital readmissions, suggesting that the association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent sepsis is related to microbiome depletion, not to severity of illness [16] .",

Beta diversity of the microbiome measured from feces of mice coming from two different laboratories demonstrated significant differences and, more importantly, mice from the first lab had significantly higher mortality following CLP, as compared to mice from the second lab (90% vs. 53%). Differences were also found in immune phenotypes in splenic or Peyer's patch lymphocytes. To verify if the differences in the microbiome were responsible for the different outcomes, mice were cohoused for 3 weeks, after which they assumed a similar microbiota composition. Interestingly, co-housed mice had similar survival regardless of their vendor of origin and differences in immune phenotype disappeared.

An important finding of this study was that the dominant factors associated with mortality and septic complications were the numbers of total obligate anaerobes [6] . To evaluate the effect of dynamics of the gut microbiome, a single-center study prospectively analyzed 12 ICU patients and showed that changes in the gut microbiota can be associated with patient prognosis [18] . Indeed, the proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes significantly changed during the stay in the ICU, and \"extreme changes\" in the Bacteroides/Firmicutes ratio were observed in almost all the patients with a poor prognosis, suggesting a correlation between alteration in gut microbiota composition and sepsis outcome [18] .",

Among them, the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most widely used. Probiotics have been increasingly applied and studied in different clinical applications. Probiotics have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of disease through competition for binding locus and nutrients with pathogens, producing bacteriocins to kill pathogens, synthesizing IgA to support immune responses and reducing inflammation. Prebiotics are defined as a non-digestible food ingredient that beneficially impacts the host by stimulating the growth and/or activity of a limited number of bacterial species in the gut.

A study by Chen and coauthors reported that prophylactic administration of a probiotic bacterial species in a septic mouse model effectively reduced mortality [22] . More recently, a study conducted on a model of septic mice specifically demonstrated that after the onset of sepsis, there was an appearance of opportunistic gut pathogens such as Staphylococcaceae and Enterococcaceae and a disappearance of beneficial Prevotellaceae [23] . Relative abundance of potentially pathogenic commensals was associated with more severe immune responses during sepsis, demonstrated by higher peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, gut epithelial cell apoptosis, and disruption of tight junctions. Interestingly, in animals pre-treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, opportunistic pathogens decreased or even disappeared, while beneficial bacteria, such as Verrucomicrobiaceae, increased, promoting inhibition of gut epithelial cell apoptosis and tight junction formation. Moreover, in a novel in vitro gut model to study Candida pathogenicity, the introduction of a microbiota of antagonistic lactobacilli emerged as a significant factor for protection against C. albicans-induced necrotic damage, with a time-, dose-, and species-dependent protective effect of probiotics against C. albicans-induced cytotoxicity [24] .",

However, various concerns have been raised regarding the type and optimal dose of probiotic therapy, as well as the small size of the individual studies. Morrow et al., in the most rigorous study, reported that the incidence of ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) in patients treated with L. rhamnosus GG was significantly lower than in controls (19.1% vs. 40.0%) in 138 ICU patients. Moreover, probiotic administration significantly reduced oropharyngeal and gastric colonization by pathogenic species [27] . However, other clinical reports showed no significant difference in the occurrence of VAP in the ICU [28] . In a recent randomized controlled study, the effect of prophylactic synbiotics on gut microbiota and on the incidence of infectious complications including enteritis, VAP, and bacteremia was evaluated in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis. Seventy-two patients completed the trial, of whom 35 patients received synbiotics and 37 patients did not. In the synbiotics group, the incidence of enteritis and the incidence of VAP were significantly lower compared to controls. The incidence of bacteremia and mortality, however, did not differ significantly between the two groups [29] . Currently, we are waiting for the results of a large randomized placebocontrolled study [30] aimed to determine the effect of L. rhamnosus GG on the incidence of VAP and other clinically important outcomes (C. difficile infection, secondary infections, diarrhea) in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02462590).",

Clinician interest in this treatment was renewed in 2013 with publication of the results of a randomized controlled trial showing the substantial superiority of FMT over standard care in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infections [35] . Based on the absolute number of introduced bacteria, FMT is thought to be the most powerful immunomodulatory tool. In animal models, FMT alone is capable of restoring bacterial communities in cecal crypts, which act as a reservoir of commensal bacteria to restore the intestinal epithelium. Crypts are also crucial in protecting intestinal stem cells and in preservation of immunological pathways by enhancing the expression of nod-like and Toll-like receptors. Depletion of commensal organisms in crypts enhances pathogen proliferation, which can result in severe inflammation and disruption of homeostasis. Another potential advantage of FMT is that, along with the transfer of bacterial communities, other products (short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, eukaryotic, and prokaryotic viruses) are introduced to the intestinal ecosystem, leading to a complete restoration of homeostasis [36] .",

We believe that FMT can have a potential role in critical patients in two directions: (1) restoration of ICU-associated dysbiosis and (2) implementation of gut decolonization of MDR organisms. In fact, the introduction of a high burden of commensal bacteria may reverse resistant pathobiont dominance and even decrease the antibiotic resistance genes present in the microbiome (resistome) [37] . However, only five cases have been described in which FMT has been employed to address disruption of the microbiota in the ICU. All these cases showed that treatment with FMT led to a successful reversal of dysbiosis, with subsequent improvement in outcome. In addition, some cases noted a steep decrease in inflammatory mediators and normalized Th1/Th2 and Th1/Th17 ratios following FMT. Apart from difficulties with extrapolating the data derived from these case reports to the general ICU population, we are far from obtaining conclusive evidence that restoration of dysbiosis by FMT in critical illness is beneficial. However, given the promising results of FMT learned from C. difficile treatment experience, clinical trials are needed to implement a microbiota-targeted approach.",

Results cannot be easily analyzed because of the high risk of bias in smaller studies, but in a recent review that considered only studies with low and moderate risk of bias, an eradication rate between 37.5% and 87.5% was described [40] [39] . Recently, a randomized controlled trial has been completed showing that patients given nonabsorbable oral antibiotics followed by FMT had a slight decrease in ESBL and CRE colonization compared with control patients, although without reaching statistical significance. The unfavorable results are potentially due to the study design (two different routes of FMT in the interventional group and contemporary antibiotic administration may have influenced carriage in the interventional group) and early trial termination [41] .
