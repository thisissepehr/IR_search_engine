Medicine is now at the heart of an array of combinatorial human, animal and mechanical materials. While the troubled nature of transplantation has been relatively well documented (eg Swazey, 1978, 1992) , less well understood are new forms of innovation that cut across machines, humans and animals raising regulatory concerns about material and cultural risk (Brown and Michael, 2004; Faulkner et al., 2004; Kent et al., 2005) . At the same time, such hybrids are powerful sources of hope -new treatments for large populations throughout the aging societies, and new sources of wealth for countries seeking a place in the emerging tissue economies.",

Hybrids signal the breach of various socio-material categories, indicating inconsistencies that disorder routines and accepted mores.

These disruptions are frequently framed around questions of new standards for the purity of cell lines, the cleanliness of animal tissues, new rules to secure safety and avoid hazard.",

This paper compares the regulatory ordering of human tissue engineering (TE) and xenotransplantation (XT) and the changing ways in which both have been defined and classified 1 for regulatory purposes. Crucially, they are areas of innovation which regulators have sought to govern separately and in isolation from one another. That is, contrasting regulatory mechanisms and definitional boundaries partition them socially and institutionally. But despite these attempts at purification, TE and XT have proven increasingly difficult to tell apart in practical and material terms. Human and animal matters, cell cultures and tissue products have much greater corporeal connection than has been institutionally recognized.",

Clinical XT has been subject to forceful regulatory prohibition over recent years with the relatively stable consensus that risks outweigh benefits, particularly in respect to transpecies disease. But recently the regulatory grip on XT has been called into question as various -at first seemingly unrelated -areas of TE have come to regulatory attention. This has resulted in significant attempts to 'clean up' the definition of XT, broadening its regulatory identity. 'TE' on the other hand signifies a far more diverse set of practices whose identity in regulation has been more plastic than that of XT. As such, regulators have sought to draw a clean distinction between different aspects of implant innovation, steering TE clear of potential contamination by more problematic hybrids like XT and stem cell therapy. The paper speculates on whether such distinctions can be sustained.",

The two views might be articulated in terms of Deleuze and Guattari's (1988) conception of 'being and becoming'. Between these extremes lies a more ambivalent position that can be identified with, among others, Haraway (eg Haraway, 1991a, b; Prins, 1995) . Myerson has unpacked this ambivalence in relation to Haraway's (1997) writing on oncomouse, a profoundly ambiguous figure with whom 'we can acknowledge our kinshipyeither as victims or as heroes' (Myerson, 2000, p. 73 ). Haraway's hybrid, the cyborg, also has political potential in terms of holding out the prospect of couplings that ultimately demolish oppressive dichotomies operating across genders, races, species and machines. And for Latour (1993) hybrids are perhaps even more ambivalent. They are often dangerous, even catastrophic -the ozone hole, climate change, BSE -and are evidence of the underlying hidden connections between humans and non-humans, and especially between 'objective' science and 'subjective' politics. Hybrids challenge representational order, disturbing the very basis of modernity's sorting. And of course, they can be highly hazardous unless recognized as such in political process, a 'parliament of things' (ibid). Hybrids have agency in as much as they can undermine attempts to conceal connection.",

            "text": "More heterogeneous than XT, TE includes cultured cell implants for cartilage repair, bone substitutes, 'living' skin tissues (like Epicel TN discussed above). Future developments are expected to include vascular prostheses, organ-assist devices (liver, kidney), whole organs, structures (heart valves, joints), neurological tissues and stem cell therapies. One influential definition describes TE as the 'regeneration of biological tissue through the use of cells, with the aid of supporting structures and/or biomolecules' (SCMPMD, 2001a) . They are often conceived of in regulatory policy communities themselves as 'borderline' or 'hybrid' products -occupying a 'regulatory vacuum' at the borders of existing regulatory frameworks. The notion of a regulatory vacuum has been the starting-point for much of the recent development of regulatory policy for human tissues, and the boundaries between pharmaceuticals, medical devices and TE are crucial areas of negotiation in re-ordering regulation. Some TE products have already been regulated as pharmaceuticals while some parts of combination products (eg using synthetic scaffolds) need to gain approval as medical devices. In the face of this complexity there has been a widely, although not unanimously, perceived need for 'new regulation' for human tissues and TE, and here we refer to two distinct pieces of regulation. 4 TE embraces two closely related regulatory fields whose boundaries are themselves unclear and overlapping. On the one hand, 'human tissues and cells' (HTCs) are defined and covered in Europe by the Tissue and Cells Directive (TCD) on the sourcing, storage, processing (eg cleaning) and distribution of a wide range of human materials (excluding, as we shall see, matters like blood and blood products and whole organs). On the other hand, the proposed 'human tissue engineering regulation' (TER) refers to manufacturing and market approval, excluding the accreditation of safety and quality of sourcing and storage covered by the TCD, and distinguishes between autologous (donor is also patient) and allogeneic (multiple recipient) applications. These two jurisdictions were already separated in the United Kingdom, whose regulatory work in the early 2000s included a tightening of standards and accountability through a code of practice for tissue banking (Department of Health, 2001) , and then a code of practice for 'human-derived therapeutic products', voluntary guidance for manufacturers in the TE field (MDA, 2002) .",

It is worth remembering here the way the regulation of XT had 'mistakenly' focused on whole organs, for years neglecting cell-based 'xeno-like' practices in TE. There is then a curious patterning in the regulation of tissues, human and xenogeneic. While HTC regulators would like not to have to embrace whole organs, XT regulators would rather not have had to embrace TE. The fact that cells (particularly ex vivo contact) are now more central in the regulation of XT poses yet more problems for HTCs and TE legislation. It is possible that the exclusion of whole organs raises similar questions about the longer-term tenability of the TCD Directive's boundaries.",

Products deemed 'tissue-engineered' are assessed in the MHRA on a case-bycase basis in the absence of TE-specific regulation.

This drew criticism from those stakeholders who preferred to see TE products as 'more devicey' (as one informant put it) than pharmaceutical. The hybridity of the technology was further highlighted by apparent territorial disputes within the EC's DG Enterprise between the medicines and medical devices jurisdictions, which in a further twist resulted in a proposal to re-classify TE within the 'biotechnology' division of EMEA -neither pharmaceutical nor device. Following a Europe-wide guidance document (CPMP, 2001) in 2003 the EC Medicinal Product Directive (MPD) was augmented by an Annex on 'advanced therapy medicinal products' (EU Commission, 2003) which in effect extended the definition of the regulatory field of medicines (as opposed to devices, or biologics, or TE) to include somatic cell therapy products, human and xenogeneic.",

And it is at this point that we can return to a consideration of the chequered regulatory history and ambiguous regulatory identity of Epicel TM, currently described by its manufacturer Genzyme as an 'autologous cell therapy product' that is 'co-cultured with mouse cells to form cultured epidermal autografts', and uses 'a cell culture medium containing bovine serum'.

Also like XT, we see these attempts at partitioning undermined by changes in the sociotechnical definition of regulatable therapeutic materials. The XT/device divide could not be sustained, nor could the cell therapy/medicines divide, nor could the TE/medicines/ devices divides as overarching distinctions. In an admission of the difficulty of assigning stable classifications to capture novel TE therapies, EC proposals for TE regulation allow for a 'lex specialis' function to adjudicate on products that are not clearly either TE or medicinal or medical device,'to minimize the risk of grey areas for borderline products' (EC DG Enterprise, 2004) .

We have illustrated how the formations of XT and TE have inter-acted with shifting regulatory terrains. We have seen both successful and unsuccessful attempts to maintain boundaries, particularly between XT and human tissues. In both fields we have seen the strength of biomedical and pharmaceutical 'institutional animals' in shaping the discourse in which novel technological governance is constructed. And we have seen the shifting definitions of scientific and social appraisal of public health risk being refracted through the composition of the regulatory bodies that governance activity produces. Thus in order to understand the variability of governance in different innovative technological fields, it is necessary to develop accounts of the hybridity of their material forms, to bring into view the detailed social, cultural and material shaping that produce regulatory orderings. And it is here perhaps that we can return to the link between regulatory ordering and deeper categorizing of nature, the human, animal and the moral. For the messy work of regulating is also an inalienably social and moral process of seeking benefit and minimizing risk in highly pluralistic, technologically inventive societies. Hybrid technologies highlight the manufactured disturbance of foundational categories and societies' attempts to manage this disruption, a partitioning and aligning process that, in turn, re-distributes the productive elements for the continuing hybridization of biomedical technologies. understood to mean the transplantation into one species of cells or tissues derived from another species. TE is commonly taken to involve a combination of cell culturation and chemical engineering to create implantable cells, skin, bone, cartilage and other body parts. 2 Note on data and fieldwork: 'Medical Device Governance: Regulation of tissue engineering in the UK and EU' (funding: UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)). This project involved data collection consisting of a literature review and 65 interviews with respondents from regulatory agencies, treatment centres, manufacturers and engineers; 'Xenotransplantation: Risk Identities and the Human/Nonhuman Interface' (funding: UK ESRC). Data collection for this project consisted of a literature review plus 25 interviews and 11 focus groups with a range of respondents including regulation, public and commercial research, clinical centres, NGOs, community and healthcare organizations. 3 'Regulatory regime' is frequently used by analysts of formal regulatory activity (eg Hood et al., 2001) but perhaps conveys greater connotations of planned, systematic, rational design than is often warranted. The verb 'ordering' (Law, 1994) adds process to the sociological concept of 'social order'. 4 In Europe, two main regulatory instruments are most directly relevant for TE activity. These are the directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells (adopted by the European Parliament in 2004) (we refer to this as the Tissues and Cells Directive (TCD) henceforth; (EU Commission/DG SANCO, 2003) ; and a proposed EC Regulation on Human Tissue Engineered Products (under the auspices of DG Enterprise (European Commission DG Enterprise, 2004). We will refer to this as the tissue engineering regulation (TER)).",
