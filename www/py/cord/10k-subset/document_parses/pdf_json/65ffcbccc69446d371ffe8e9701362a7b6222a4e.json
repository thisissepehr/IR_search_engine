Previous studies performed in sepsis patients and murine endotoxic shock models have shown that increased systemic pancreatic proteases are a cause of ensuing organ dysfunction (1, 2) . Objectives: Therefore, we wanted to look into the intestinal mucus composition after experimental sepsis to evaluate if the local impact of a heightened proteolytic activity modulated initial immune responses. Methods: Sham or Cecal liagtion puncture (CLP) was performed in male C57bl6 mice aged [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] week old. Animals were euthanized after 24 h and mucus from small intestine (jejunum) and large intestine (colon) were obtained. A soluble fraction of the mucus was prepared by adding Phosphate Buffered Saline to the mucus, with or without protease inhibitors, sonicated and supernatant was collected for measurement of complement factors and proteases respectively. Results: After confirming through ELISA, we used western blot analysis to look into C5 and C3 complement fragments, which were copiously generated in the jejunum of CLP mice compared to sham mice. However, this effect was not completely the same for colon mucus samples of CLP mice. As these cleavage products could be due to proteolytic activity, we measured non-specific total protease and found that CLP mice had a higher protease content in their mucus. As commercially available chromogenic substrates were unreliable for protease activity measurements, we established the use of chargechanging peptides as an analytical tool to measure specific protease activity. We found MMP2/9 and elastase activities significantly higher and no difference in trypsin activity in CLP jejunum mucus versus sham mucus. Conclusions: Therefore, during sepsis, locally generated complement fragments could be due to higher protease content and may have further immunopathological implication.

Introduction: Necroptosis, a rarely investigated form of programmed cell death, is employed in many cell types followed by injury and facilitates cell death in a controlled manner which simultaneously stimulates inflammation. This cell death mechanism is characterized by swelling of the cell followed by rupturing of the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of the receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) and hyperphosphorylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) forms the necrosome and activates mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) which leads to pore formation and cell death. Monitoring of necroptosis regulating proteins in response to therapeutic interventions would help to develop a novel treatment strategy to patient under several disease entity following impaired liver function e.g. cholestasis or inflammation. However, the role of RIPK3 in the liver remains controversial.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Objectives: Here we investigated, in light of the fact that RIPK3 expression in the liver is controversially discussed, the impact of necroptosis in liver dysfunction. Methods: Protein expression of different mediators of necroptosis is examined in primary human hepatocytes (pHep) and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, HepG2 cells overexpressing human RIPK3 are stimulated with pro-inflammatory molecules (toxic bile acids, cytokines) and the activation of necroptosis and inflammation are determined. Slices from paraffin-embedded liver samples of patients that show characteristics of cholestasis or inflammation are also analyzed in relation to the expression of necroptosis mediators. Results: Our results depict that pHep and HepG2 cells are not able to undergo necroptosis under basal conditions due to the lack of RIPK3. The formation of the necrosome and the signal transduction following phosphorylation of MLKL is interrupted. Overexpression of RIPK3 in HepG2 cells leads to significant RIPK3 phosphorylation. Bile acid treatment of RIPK3-overexpressing HepG2 cells affects the RIPK3 and P-RIPK3 expression in dependence on the modification of the bile acids. Moreover, analysis of cytokines shows also a significant increase after overexpression of RIPK3 in HepG2 cells.

PI3K-c is a promising target of membrane shaping processes, cytoskeletal remodeling, cellular polarization, metabolism, and many other essential cellular developments. Furthermore, it is associated with many G protein-coupled receptors, such as chemokine receptors in vivo, playing an important role in several immune processes.

The affected organs are mainly the liver, lung, kidneys and heart and circulation [1, 2] . Since MOF is often the cause of death of the septic patient, detailed characterization of the underlying (patho-) physiological and molecular mechanisms and resulting treatment approaches can lead to an improvement in the course of sepsis. In order to identify or characterize these underlying mechanisms and to test appropriate therapies, animal models are often initially used. However, translation of preclinical findings into a clinical setting, thus far, has not been very successful. A contributing factor may be that in patients, vital parameters are continuously monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas in rodents such sustained monitoring is rare. In mice, sepsis is induced, for instance, by surgical cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) and experimental therapy is started at a predefined time point that is usually independent of vital parameters. This approach does not take into account either the innate differences in strength and duration of individual immune responses or the status of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. In order to increase the translatability of the preclinical to the clinical situation, an implantable wireless biometric animal telemetry system can be used. This allows real-time monitoring, measurement and documentation of the vital parameters, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, temperature and physical activity [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Such a system, which is very similar to the human situation in the ICU, offers the possibility in mice to start a therapy or to determine timing for organ/blood/serum sampling, based on their vital parameters. In addition, this much more precise monitoring of the mice provides detailed information on the course of sepsis and allows a more precise decision on whether the trial must be stopped prematurely in order to kill mice humanely [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 295, "end": 297, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1694, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1698, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1702, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1706, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1710, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2151, "end": 2154, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2019"}, {"text": "Objectives: The first aim of the study was to explore vital parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and ECG in mice after induction of an experimental sepsis by CLP. These data provide an understanding of (patho-) physiological processes during the course of sepsis as a basis to develop new therapy approaches and to optimize existing therapies. The second aim was to investigate the impact of transmitter implantation per se by comparing implanted septic mice with non-implanted septic mice. Finally, the third aim was to determine whether insight into real-time vital parameters allows a more precise decision to be taken on termination criteria, thus assessing whether the use of a telemetry system introduces a refinement to the CLP model. Methods: We used the implantable wireless biometric animal Phys-ioTelTM HD-X11 telemetry system (Data Sciences International (DSI), St. Paul, USA) for in vivo measurement of blood pressure, ECG, heart rate, temperature and physical activity. Under the use of an animal application (authorization number V54-19 c 20/15-F152/ 1016), approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the State of Hesse, Germany, male C57BL/6N mice (Charles River Laboratories Germany GmbH, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) aged 10-12 weeks were utilized for all experiments. For the implantation of the blood pressure catheter under ketamine/xylazine (120/8 mg/kg) anesthesia, the left carotid artery was used. The transmitter device body was placed along the lateral flank between the fore limb and hind limb. The continuous data acquisition of all vital parameters began immediately after an animal emerged fully from the anesthesia. At the earliest 7 days subsequent to implantation of the telemetry transmitter, a 21-gauge, double puncture CLP with a cecal ligation of 2/3 was performed under isoflurane anesthesia. Sham animals underwent a laparotomy without CLP. A control group underwent only the CLP operation, as described above, without prior implantation of a telemetry transmitter. At the latest 48 h after CLP/sham operation, mice were euthanized and heparinized and whole blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture using a sterile technique for detailed analysis of blood parameters. The peritoneal cavity was irrigated with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for peritoneal lavage and samples were collected in a sterile fashion to determine the bacterial load as colony-forming units (CFUs) . Results: We studied murine physiology during the first 48 h after CLP/Sham operation. As expected, we observed marked heterogeneity in the physiological and thermoregulatory responses to sham operation. Nevertheless, blood parameters and CFUs in sham mice remained in the range of those in healthy control mice, which underwent neither implantation of the wireless biometric animal telemetry transmitter system nor a CLP/Sham operation. In contrast, mice subjected to CLP-induced sepsis showed distinct differences in physiological and thermoregulatory responses. Mice that died within the first 24 h after sepsis induction lost an average of nearly 30% of the core body temperature within this time. In parallel, during this period, the blood pressure of septic mice decreased by an average of almost 50%. In this case, the temperature was correlated with blood pressure, expressed as a ratio/score for sepsis progress/severity, as reflected in a signature in the progression curves. Along with this signature, a systematically decreased heart rate over a 10-h period before death was observed. The different trajectories in the physiological and thermoregulatory responses between septic mice that died and those that survived were also reflected in the very different blood parameters and CFUs. Mice that died showed a significantly higher bacterial load. In addition, blood parameters like aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), as well as the differential haematogram for neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, thrombocytes and leucocytes, were substantially different between mice that died and mice that survived. Additionally, we compared implanted with non-implanted CLP mice to determine the impact of the wireless biometric animal telemetry transmitter system on the severity and progression of sepsis. Fifty percent of non-implanted mice died within the first 24 h after sepsis induction. In contrast, only 37.5% of the implanted mice died within the same period following sepsis induction. This result demonstrates that prior implantation of the telemetry transmitter per se has an effect on survival after CLPinduced sepsis, possibly due to a pre-activation of the immune system, which helps to fight against infection caused by CLP-induced sepsis. The reasons for this are still unclear and must be characterized in detail in subsequent studies. This suggestion is supported by our initial data regarding different blood parameters. In non-implanted mice which died as a result of the CLP-induced sepsis, the levels of AST and ALT were clearly increased compared to implanted mice. In both groups, this also applied to surviving mice. Moreover, inspection of the differential haematogram reveals clear differences in the quantities of lymphocytes, monocytes, thrombocytes and leucocytes between implanted and non-implanted mice.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2464, "end": 2470, "text": "(CFUs)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2019"}, {"text": "Conclusions: The combination of the murine polymicrobial CLP sepsis model with the implantable wireless biometric animal telemetry system is a powerful tool to better understand the (patho-) physiological processes during the course of sepsis by objective, realtime measurement of physiological and thermoregulatory parameters.

CSE, an endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) producing enzyme, is a regulator of GCinduced gluconeogenesis via PGC1alpha (13).

Both PTV and CBF are concentration dependent positively stimulated by IL-6 (100 ng/ml) via the epithelial expressed IL-6 receptor (n = 6).

We hypothesized that specific MIRs might be up-regulated in the septic endothelium thereby contributing to vascular barrier breakdown. Objectives: To identify regulated MIRs in the septic endothelium and to decipher their role in endothelial permeability. Methods: Regulated MIRs were screened by an unbiased MIR array approach from murine lung endothelial cells (CD146? magnetic isolation). In vivo, the effect of specific MIRs on permeability was assessed in a transgenic zebrafish (flk:mCherry) and a murine knockout (KO B6.Cg-Mir155tm1.1Rsky/J) model. Both Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used for the induction of systemic inflammation. Readouts were pulmonary permeability (Evans Blue), activity scoring and survival. Mechanistic studies were done in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using standard molecular biology tools (RT-PCR, Immunoblots) and functional real-time permeability measurements (ECIS-TER). Additionally, immediate post mortem kidney biopsies (n = 16) were performed to evaluate the expression of MIRs in a septic human organism. Results: The array revealed that MIR155 was significantly upregulated (259). Transgenic overexpression of MIR155 in zebrafish-as a screening tool-led to a massive induction of vascular permeability (eye assay, p \\ 0.01).

Remotely, pneumococcal CAP triggers a hepatic activation of the sterol biosynthesis through a yet unknown mechanism that depends on PLY. Objectives: The direct impact of PLY on hepatocytes is determined. Supplementation of cholesterol species is evaluated as candidate for adjuvant therapy to counteract pore formation. The underlying principle of a protective effect of cholesterol supplementation is investigated. Methods: Membrane integrity and pore formation is analyzed by LDH-release assay and PI staining using dynamic live cell imaging techniques. Stress and sterol signaling adaption of HepG2 cells towards PLY challenge is examined by Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. Cellular cholesterol of HepG2 cells is quantified by mass spectrometry and Filipin III staining. Membrane viscosity is characterized by applying live-cell two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of a bimodal dye sensing the cholesterol environment. In a clinical trial at the Jena University Hospital, a link between patient plasma cholesterol level and CAP score was assessed. Results: Supplementation of cholesterol resulted in amelioration of PLY toxicity, increased membrane integrity and a delay of pore formation. PLY directly activates key regulators of the sterol homeostasis on the protein level whereas gene expression is downregulated globally in HepG2 cells. Intriguingly, cells respond to PLY by increasing their cholesterol content despite cholesterol being the toxin's receptor for cell membrane recognition. By supplementation of cholesterol the membrane is shifted to a more rigid phase, hindering pore formation. In the clinic, CAP patients with elevated plasma cholesterol are significantly less prone to the progression of CAP. Conclusions: We conclude that PLY pore formation preferentially targets cholesterol in a highly flexible membrane resulting in shedding and cell death. Together, we highlight the role of a hepatic induction of cholesterol biosynthesis following PLY stress and outline the biophysical reasons for a protective effect of cholesterol supplementation against a cholesterol-dependent pore forming toxin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infection 2019"}, {"text": "Hemoadsorption with CytoSorb, a new treatment for Sepsis Ferrara G (1), Giuliano L (2), Gatta G (1), Gorgoglione G (2), Melchionda G (2), Aucella F (1) (1) Department of Nephrology, (2) Intensive Care Unit Introduction: Sepsis is the most common cause of death in medical intensive care units (ICU). If sepsis progresses to refractory septic shock, mortality may reach 90-100% despite optimum current therapy. One of the hallmarks of sepsis is the excessive release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators causing refractory hypotension, tissue damage, metabolic acidosis and ultimately multiple organ failure. Objectives: Cytokine reduction by hemoadsorption represents a new concept for blood purification, developed to attenuate the systemic levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators released in the early phase of sepsis. Methods: We evaluated the impact of a new hemoadsorption device (CytoSorb), used as adjunctive therapy, on hemodynamics and clinically relevant outcome parameters in 24 critically ill patients with septic shock and in need of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Intensive Care Unit. Mean levels of MAP, procalcitonin, noradrenalin need and SOFA score were evaluated. RRT of acute renal failure was performed either as continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) at the discretion of the attending physician. Flow rates were set to achieve a dialysis dose of 25 ml/kg/h, blood flow rate was set accordingly. Hemoperfusion was started after refractory shock was diagnosed. The adsorber [total volume 300 ml, priming volume 120 ml, filled with sterile normal saline (NaCl 0.9%)] was connected in a PRAE-filter position into the RRT circuit. The first exchange was performed within 24 h without interruption. Further adsorber exchanges were at the discretion of the physicians. Results: After Cytosorb treatment procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and white cells count all decreased vs basal levels (Table 1) . This feature was associated with hemodynamic stabilization and a reduction of noradrenaline infusion. SOFA score improved in 11/24 patients, overall mortality was 63%. Treatment using the CytoSorb device was safe and well-tolerated with no device-related adverse events during or after the treatment sessions. Conclusions: In severe septic shock unresponsive to standard treatment, haemodynamic stabilization and inflammatory parameters improved using cytokine adsorption therapy. These effects seem to be more pronounced in patients in whom therapy started within 24 h of sepsis diagnosis, whereas a delay in the start of therapy was associated with a poor response to therapy in terms of reduction of catecholamine demand and survival. Detailed studies and registry reports may better define the potential benefits of this new treatment option. Introduction: One possible long-term consequence of sepsis is hematogenous osteomyelitis, i.e. the spread of bacteria from the blood stream to the bone. The clinical picture of this disease is swelling and deformation of the bone, pain, redness, fever and weakness. The most common underlying pathogen is the Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus, which is one of the most frequently found pathogen in hospital. These bacteria can invade cells, adopt an intracellular life cycle and persist in the bone for years before causing symptoms. Their intracellular appearance is especially difficult to treat with antibiotics because of a reduced metabolic rate and the challenge to target the drugs into the host cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1989, "end": 1998, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF13"}], "section": "Infection 2019"}, {"text": "Objectives: In this study we aim to define the localization of bacteria within the bone in an established mouse model [1] during the acute and chronic state of hematogenous osteomyelitis.

Introduction: The sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes and also plays an important role in the function of the immune system. As a part of the inflammatory response, S1P mediates distinct signaling pathways that protect against sepsis. In a recent study we showed that S1P signaling could mimic the positive effects of genotoxic stress achieved in vivo in experimental sepsis experiments in mice and in vitro in cell culture upon stimulation of the lung epithelial cell line H1975 with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). These studies revealed that particularly inhibition of the S1P degrading enzyme S1P lyase and activation of the S1P receptor type 3 (S1PR3) are involved in genotoxic stress-induced S1P signaling, leading to tissue tolerance and protection against systemic inflammation.

Introduction: The role of the host immune response is highly controversial under septic conditions. In addition to a hyperinflammatory response, recent studies indicate that immunosuppressive pathways are triggered concomitantly. The Spred protein family (Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein) is involved in the regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is activated in sepsis in numerous immune cells. Strikingly, knockout of SPRED2 was shown to promote proinflammatory events resulting in radically opposed outcomes in mice subjected to different sepsis triggers: Thus, whereas deficiency of Spred2 exacerbated LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced acute lung inflammation, it exerted protective effects in septic peritonitis. These findings indicate that Spred's regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway can have drastically diverse consequences on sepsis outcome in distinct clinical scenarios. Despite these appreciations, the precise mode of action of Spred is still unsettled.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "048"}, {"text": "Objectives: In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the modulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by Spred1. Understanding the molecular basis of the signal transduction regulation by Spred may reveal new opportunities for immunomodulatory approaches in sepsis therapy. Methods: After stimulation with EGF (epidermal growth factor), HeLa cells overexpressing Spred1 were lysed and exposed to glutathione-Sepharose for a Ras-GTP pull-down. Ras activation was analyzed by Western blotting. HEK293 cells overexpressing Spred1 were fixed and immunostained using fluorophor-labelled secondary antibodies prior to analysis via fluorescence microscopy. Using the proximity biotinylation assay followed by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, we intend to identify Spred1 interactors and proximate proteins that team up with Spred1 for Ras regulation. The biotinylated target proteins were visualized by Western blotting with Avidin. Results: Overexpression of Spred1 reduced EGF-stimulated formation of active Ras-GTP, showing that Spred1 inhibits the pathway at the level of Ras. Immunocytochemistry analysis further revealed that Spred1 overexpression resulted in formation of giant early endosomes. This abnormal phenomenon affected the steady-state distribution of Ras causing an accumulation of Ras in the giant endosomes. Initial screening results revealed a huge amount of Spred1 interaction partners playing a role in endocytotic processes which is consistent with the observed effect of Spred1 on endosome formation. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that Spred1 is involved in the regulation of early endosome trafficking and may attenuate Ras activity indirectly by affecting its subcellular distribution in terms of altered endosome dynamics. This might represent a molecular mechanism for targeting the immune imbalance in sepsis at its roots. Introduction: Hepatocytes express transporting proteins like the multidrug-resistance associated polypeptide 2 (MRP2) on their apical pole to eliminate bile salts as well as endo-and xenobiotics into the bile. To secure its eliminating function, MRP2 has anchored into the canalicular membrane via the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family proteins that link it to the scaffolding fibrillary actin (f-actin). In the course of sepsis, local cytokine release will stimulate numerous signaling cascades. Among many others, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the upregulation of Protein Kinase C (PKC) family enzymes has been notified. In preliminary cell culture experiments, PKC activation as well as ROS inducement has led to the loss of MRP2 from the canalicular membrane and therefore to excretory dysfunction in hepatocytes (cholestasis). Objectives: To understand the mechanisms behind hepatocyte scaffolding and MRP2 internalization that lead to excretory dysfunction, we investigated the link to ROS release and PKC upregulation in small rodent liver tissue. Methods: We established a method of liver perfusion in mice with physiological buffer solution. In the treatment groups, ROS inducer tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) or the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were added to the buffer. Perfused liver tissue was stained for MRP2, ERM-proteins, and f-actin. The quantity, as well as the localization of stained proteins in hepatocytes, were analyzed via confocal imaging.

Contrarily, an alternative activation of the MU is triggered e.g. by interleukin-4 (IL4), leading to an anti-inflammatory expression pattern.

MS analysis of PPARc revealed that cysteine residues located in the zinc finger regions, reflected by the MS analyzed fragments aa 90-115, aa 116-130, and aa 160-167 of PPARc, were highly oxidized in response to LPS/IFNc, accompanied by phosphorylation of serine 82. IL4-stimulation provoked minor serine 82 phosphorylation and less cysteine oxidation, referring to a reductive milieu. Mutating these cysteines to alanine to mimic PPARc oxidation reduced its reporter gene transactivation, indicating lower transactivating ability of PPARc associated with classically activated MU. Moreover, classically compared to alternatively MU polarization alters PPARc expression and localization, giving rise to vimentin binding of PPARc in classically activated MU only, suggesting an altered protein-protein interaction profile of PPARc accompanying the MU phenotype shift.

Sepsis can also be described as a ''severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections'' (NIH/NHLBI Sepsis Panel 2010), leading to multiple organ failure by disrupting the nurturing microcirculation. There are many mediators that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, so targeting only a single one is unlikely to improve sepsis outcomes. Three potent sepsis mediators significantly elevated in septic shock and believed to be significant contributors to endothelial dysfunction are Heparin-binding protein (HBP), Histone H4 and lipopolysaccharidebinding protein (LBP). HBP is a mediator with positive local, but disadvantageous systemic effects. After contact with the endothelium HBP is released by activated neutrophils, functioning inter alia as a chemoattractant and inducer of endothelial leakage for neutrophil extravasation. However, in sepsis patients HBP is an early indicator of developing circulatory failure and death. Histones are intracellular proteins that compact chromosomal DNA in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells. They are released upon cellular damage and contribute to initiation, amplification, and propagation of DIC. High histone levels can be found in sepsis, trauma, and pancreatitis. Histones are highly inflammatory and induce the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. They contribute to DIC by activating platelets and promoting thrombin generation. LBP is an acute phase protein that mediates the inflammatory effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by Toll-like receptor 4 activation. LBP is necessary for inducing inflammation on human glomerular endothelial cells, and reduction of plasma LBP levels has been shown to prevent endothelial and tubular dysfunction in animal models (Castellano et al. 2014 Results: Results showed a very rapid and significant reduction of HBP, Histone H4 and LBP by the heparinized beads. For HBP, reductions of 99.9%, 89.9%, and 50% for heparinized beads, hydrophilic control beads, and cationic control beads, respectively. For Histone H4, reductions of 98% and 17% were observed for heparinized and hydrophilic control beads, respectively. LBP was cleared at 100% (heparinized beads) and 0% (untreated beads). The hydrophilic control beads are slightly electronegative, which may explain the binding to this surface, however the hydrophilic beads are not sufficiently blood compatible, whereas the heparin-functional beads are antithrombogenic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2082, "end": 2105, "text": "(Castellano et al. 2014", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "081"}, {"text": "The endothelial function is primarily regulated through the glycocalyx as it mediates adhesion of platelets and leukocytes, hemostasis, and vascular barrier functions.

Accordingly, this organ is highly prone to sepsis-induced inflammation and liver dysfunction. The liver harbors high macrophage counts, comprising 80% of the body's macrophages. In order to prevent liver damage as a result of an exaggerated inflammatory response, the activation and transformation of monocytes to macrophages underlies a strict regulatory mechanism. Upon infection, monocytes/macrophages undergo a metabolic reprogramming regulated by one of the most important metabolic regulators, mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). The serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR is a crucial regulator of cellular metabolism, growth and survival in response to hormones, growth factors and nutrients.

For this purpose, HepaRG and HUVEC cells were seeded on a membrane that functions as a cell culture substrate. Monocytes were isolated from a human donor and subsequently electroporated for a siRNA-mediated knockdown of the vital negative regulator of mTOR, TSC1/TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex). The mutated monocytes were seeded on the chip and cultured for 10 days. The cells on the membrane of the chips were fixed and immunostained for microscopic analyses. Furthermore the cytokine profile as well as clinical parameters were examined from cell culture medium supernatants. Additionally, pharmacological approaches were performed by using inhibitors (Rapamycin and Torin 1) and an activator (MHY145) of mTOR in the chip model. Results: Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR with Rapamycin and Torin 1 resulted in damage to the vascular layer in the liver chip organoid under LPS (lipopolysaccharide) challenge. Expression of the vascular endothelial cell marker VE-cadherin was not detectable 72 h after stimulation with LPS. Inhibition of mTOR further caused elevated levels of proinflammatory interleukines (IL-1b, IL-18 and IL-6). In case of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, a significant decrease was detected after measuring the cytokine expression from the cell supernatant. Upon stimulation with the mTOR activator MHY1485, no damage of the vascular layer was detected and VEcadherin was present even after LPS stimulation.

Introduction: Organ damage and mortality in sepsis have been attributed to deleterious and inappropriate host response during infection. Over the course of sepsis a systemic hyper inflammatory response as well as innate immunosuppression may occur. Activation of the innate immune system is a key host defense strategy for clearance of the bacteria. The innate immune system recognizes pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) through a set of germline-encoded proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRR). Apart from surface PRRs, a wide array of microbial structures like lipids and nucleic acids also activate the cytosolic inflammasome signaling cascade. Depending on the ligand, inflammasome activation can occur through either the canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation pathways. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are the main causal organisms of adult and neonatal sepsis. Molecular mechanisms which activate inflammasome pathways during Gram-positive bacterial infection and sepsis is poorly understood. Objectives: In the pathogenesis of sepsis, how Gram-positive bacterial PAMPs activate the immune system is a major question. Having recently discovered outer membrane vesicles as mediators of inflammasome activation, we are currently analyzing pathways activated by extracellular vesicles derived from SA and GBS. Methods: Re-addressing the formation and activation of the inflammasome pathway induced by bacterial extracellular vesicles. We used an array of interdisciplinary techniques including electron microscopy combined with state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas genome editing technique and label free vibrational spectroscopic methods to study Grampositive bacterial recognition by human macrophages. Results: We carried out a comprehensive structural and biochemical analysis of extracellular vesicles isolated from Gram-positive bacteria. We found that a subset of extracellular vesicles enriched with lipids encoded by a pathogenicity island were potent inducers of canonical inflammasome pathway. Further characterization of the different biomolecules of these extracellular vesicles has allowed us to decipher a novel pathway by which SA and GBS stimulate human macrophages.

Introduction: Metabolic adaptation has been described as the ability to prevent metabolic dysfunction and damage imposed to tissues in face of excessive inflammation during infections. Adaptation to hosts imposed stress can be achieved through conserved metabolic mechanisms (1) (2) (3) (4) . Systemic infections, concur with host maladaptive stress and damage responses, resulting in insufficient adaptation and failure to restore tissue homeostasis, ultimately leading to disease (3, 4) . Expression of the stress-inducible Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, encoded by the HMOX1 gene, has been shown to lessen disease severity in various inflammatory disease including sepsis (5-8) which has been attributed to the removal of the pro-oxidant labile heme preventing cellular damage. Moreover, in humans, polymorphisms in the promoter of HMOX1 could be related to disease severity and outcome in bacterial sepsis and malaria (8, 9) . Previous work using a constitutive Hmox1 knock out animal model, as shown that HO-1 affords disease tolerance against a polymicrobial infection (7). However, embryonic deficiency in HO-1 is partially lethal, which leads to a reduced amount of successful Hmox1 constitutively deleted mice pups (9, 10). Successfully deleted Hmox1 animals, were reported to show progressive chronic inflammatory disease characterized by enlarged spleens and hepatic inflammatory lesions, making them an unsuitable model to study metabolic adaptation (10). To bypass this obstacle, a novel animal model ROSA26Cre-ERT2 Hmox1lox/lox, was developed by Miguel Soares, IGC, Portugal. Changing the deletion type from constitutive to conditional, allowed to avoid the lack of HO-1, during embryonic development. Deleting Hmox1 after birth prevented the progressive chronic inflammation observed in the Hmox1 constitutive knock-out model.

Targeted metabolomics analyzes for energy metabolism intermediates, of liver and kidneys, revealed a distinct metabolic response from ROSA26Cre-ERT2 Hmox1D/D, after 20 h of heme treatment. Noteworthy, serologic markers shown an evident increase in kidney damage markers, accompanied with elevated levels of potassium. These results reveal a maladaptive stress response in conditional delete Hmox1 mice after 20 h of heme treatment. Labile heme is a known strong damage inducer mainly through redox reactions. However, administration of N-acetylcysteine a potent antioxidant, did not affect the survival rate. Notwithstanding these results, absence of HO-1 was proven not detrimental during LPS induced endotoxic shock, nor with acute and chronic S. aureus infection. Introduction: We and others have recently provided experimental evidence that host defense mechanisms in sepsis rely on an appropriate metabolic adaptation of parenchymal tissues. While the state and activity of immune system can routinely be assessed during infection, measuring metabolic adaptation in parenchymal tissue is hardly possible due to the inaccessibility of the compartment. Therefore, the identification of surrogate parameters reflecting metabolic function are needed to allow to determine host defense mechanisms in sepsis allowing to monitor the disease course disease and ultimately to adapt treatments. Stable isotopologues of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) such as 13 C have been shown to be differentially metabolized in tissues under stress, including sepsis in animal models. Its applicability in humans and its association with the host defense response are currently unknown.

Breath analysis of exhaled CO 2 isotopologues was successful in all volunteers at all time points. The breath signal was stably detected in all measurements. Rations of 13 C/ 12 C doubled after the first LPS challenge compared to control levels.

Although during innate immunosuppression cell surface signaling is attenuated, the host cell may remain equipped with distinct cytosolic receptors that defend against invading pathogens. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-protein complexes, which assemble in response to cytosolic PAMPs or endogenous DAMPs.

Introduction: Progranulin (PGRN) is a pleiotropic growth factor and a multifaceted immune-regulatory molecule involved in the regulation of signaling pathways of host-defense during infection and inflammation. It is critical in innate immunity against bacteria and is known to target TLR4 which recognizes LPS (1-3). PGRN deficiency in experimental animals leads to increased vulnerability to LPS-induced septic shock and high mortality (1). Increased PGRN plasma levels have been described in in patients with sepsis (4). Objectives: To quantify the performance characteristics of PGRN plasma levels as a biomarker for sepsis in comparison to the established marker procalcitonin (PCT) and others, and to delineate molecular networks involving upregulated PGRN in sepsis. Methods: The diagnostic performance of PGRN was assessed by calculating Area Under Curve (AUC) and Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) for PGRN alone, as well as in comparison to PCT in 114 consecutively recruited patients with sepsis, who served as an initial exploratory sample. A further 127 independently recruited patients were included in a second confirmatory cohort (all fulfilling Sepsis-3 criteria). One hundred-eighty-two ICU patients with a sterile inflammatory reaction (SIRS) after cardiac surgery were studied to quantify the ability of PGRN to discriminate between SIRS and sepsis. In order to establish logic validity of the novel biomarker, we isolated miRNAs and mRNAs samples from blood cells of septic shock patients (n = 7) and healthy volunteers (n = 7) for deep sequencing (NGS).

However, a detailed analysis of patients pulmonary microbiome as well as its influence on the course of the disease has not been performed yet.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "022"}, {"text": "Objectives: The objectives of this study were therefore to examine changes in the pulmonary microbiome in ARDS patients and their influence on patients' outcome by the use of a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based approach. Methods: In total, 30 patients in two groups were enrolled in the presented study: (1) patients with sepsis-associated ARDS (n = 15) and (2) patients undergoing esophageal resection (n = 15) representing the control group. In the ARDS group, blood samples were collected at ARDS onset as well as 5 days and 10 days afterwards. At the same timepoints, bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed in order to collect epithelial lining fluid for culture-based as well as NGS-based longitudinal analyses of the pulmonary microbiome. In the control group, epithelial lining fluids and blood samples were collected only once, immediately prior to the surgical procedure. Results: ARDS patients showed a significantly decreased a-diversity (p = 0.003) and an increased dominance (p = 0.005) of their pulmonary microbiome. The a-diversity negatively correlated with the length of ICU stay and the need for mechanical ventilation. In 42.9% of the ARDS patients, culture-based results were not concordant with the NGS-based results. Moreover, 5 culture-based analyses were even negative, although the NGS showed a bacterial colonization. Conclusions: As assessed by a NGS-based diagnostic approach, patients with a sepsis-associated ARDS reveal a significant dysbiosis of the pulmonary microbiome. Moreover, these changes correlate well with the clinical course of the disease. Therefore, a NGS-based diagnostic approach might be a promising tool for pathogen identification as well as therapy guidance in ARDS patients. Introduction: Sepsis is frequently associated with critical ill patients. Assessment of disease severity at the time of initial presentation could be helpful in the patient management. Procalcitonin (PCT) is commonly used in the diagnosis of sepsis. Presepsin (PSEP) has been shown to provide powerful prognostication in sepsis. Objectives: We thought to evaluate the validity of PCT and PSEP for the diagnosis of sepsis and the assessment of disease severity and outcome prediction in the setting of a cardio-vascular intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: 71 patients admitted to a cardio-vascular ICU were included. PCT and PSEP were determined at the time of initial presentation by using Elecsys BRAHMS PCT (Roche, Switzerland) and PATHFAST Presepsin (LSIM, Japan). Samples were obtained at the day of admission to ICU. The primary study endpoint was death during hospitalization. Results: 16 patients obtained a transfemoral implantation of a prostethic aortic valve (TAVI), who recovered rather quickly without complication and served as control group. Of the remaining group 27, 23 and 5 patients were assigned to sepsis, resuscitation after sudden cardiac death and pneumonia requiring assisted ventilation, respectively. The PCT values of the control group were found to be below the cutoff for bacterial infection of 0,5 pg/L (max 0.29 pg/L), whereas the corresponding PSEP values failed to comply. In 9 patients PSEP values were below the cutoff of 350 ng/L (max 346 ng/ L) but in 7 patients PSEP exceeded the cutoff (min 634 ng/L). 24 patients of the sepsis group exhibited PCT values above the established cutoff of 2 pg/L but 3 patients had values \\ 2 pg/L (max 0.645 pg/L) although these patients were assigned to septic shock. PSEP values in all patients of the sepsis group exceeded the cutoff of 350 ng/L (min 1030 ng/L). 23 (41.8%) patients died and 29 (52.7%) needed dialysis. The majority of non-survivors occurred in the sepsis group 17 (63.0%) whereas only 6 (13.6%) where belonging to patients without sepsis. ROC analysis for sepsis revealed AUC values for PCT and PSEP of 0.806 and 0.923. AUC values for death in the sepsis group revealed AUC values of 0.706 (sens 76.5%, spec 70%, crit. 2337 ng/L) and 0.506 (sens 88.2%, spec 30%, crit. 3.06 pg/L) for PSEP and PCT, respectively. For prediction of need of dialysis for PCT and PSEP the ROC analysis revealed AUC values of 0.798 and 0.874. These findings showed that PCT and PSEP could complement each other in the diagnosis of sepsis and risk stratification in patients admitted to a cardio-vascular ICU. PCT could be used for the identification of sepsis at admission with high diagnostic validity, whereas PSEP is superior in prognostication and prediction of outcome in sepsis. Conclusions: Combination of PCT and PSEP provided a higher validity in identification and risk stratification of septic patients admitted to a cardio-vascular ICU. PSEP demonstrated strong relationship with disease severity and outcome. The PATHFAST system allows early determination of PSEP from whole blood in the ICU in addition to PCT and may improve the management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "022"}, {"text": "Simultaneous assessment of D-dimer, presepsin and qSOFA in patients admitted with early sepsis to the emergency department Spanuth E (1), Engesser P (2) Introduction: Coagulation activation during sepsis can initiate multiple organ failure. D-dimer as a highly sensitive marker of coagulation activation may early indicate the presence of sepsis induced organ failure. Presepsin (PSEP) provide early prognostication in sepsis. The qSOFA score defined by the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock can be assessed at patient admission without time delay by laboratory tests. The qSOFA score has been shown to be associated with an increased probability of mortality and can be used for prognostication. Objectives: To compare qSOFA and the POC tests D-dimer and presepsin (PSEP) at admission for assessment of organ dysfunction and differentiation of complicated clinical causes or mortality risk. Methods: 109 Patients admitted with signs of sepsis were included. The qSOFA score was calculated from respiratory rate, GCS score and systolic blood pressure using the recommended thresholds. The DIC score was established according to the ISTH (International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis) guidelines. D-dimer, PSEP and NT-proBNP were determined using the PATHFAST TM platform from LSI Medience Corporation. Creatinine, CRP and lactate were measured using laboratory methods. Results: Discrimination between patients with uncomplicated sepsis (N = 49) and septic shock (N = 69) revealed AUC values of 0.657, 0.626, 0.613, 0,553, 0.762 and 0.884, 0.858 for CRP, lactate, NT-proBNP, qSOFA, PSEP and D-dimer, and 0.978 for the simultaneous assessment of qSOFA ?

AUC values of mortality prediction were 0.517, 0.605, 0.665, 0.708, 0748, 0.842 and 0.848, 0.876 for CRP, D-dimer, NT-proBNP, lactate, PSEP, qSOFA, and the simultaneous assessment of qSOFA ? D-dimer and qSOFA ? D-dimer ? PSEP, respectively. Comparison of the DIC score and D-dimer revealed higher discriminatory validity of D-dimer for prediction of death and septic shock. The AUC-values for DIC score and D-Dimer for prediction of death were 0.514 vs. 0.605 and for discrimination between sepsis and severe sepsis or septic shock 0.526 vs. 0.639, respectively. Using the threshold C 2 of qSOFA, C 0,5 mg/L of D-dimer and [ 500 ng/L of PSEP, qSOFA detected 18 non-survivors (95%) and 41 patients of the high-risk group (82%), D-dimer detected 17 non-survivors (89%) and 33 (66%) patients of the high-risk group (n = 50) and PSEP detected 18 non-survivors (95%) and 45 patients of the high-risk group (89%). qSOFA score C 2 and B 1 was estimated in 34 (31.2%) and 75 (68.8%) patients, from whom 27 (79.4%) and 35 (46.6%) were assigned for prediction of septic shock by using an algorithm of PSEP [ 1000 ng/L and D-dimer [ 0,5 mg/L, revealing finally 79.4% of patients with qSOFA C 2 for septic shock and 53.4% of patients with qSOFA B 1 for uncomplicated sepsis. Conclusions: The simultaneous assessment of qSOFA ? D-dimer or qSOFA ? D-dimer ? PSEP provided added value to assess the severity and early mortality risk in patients admitted with sepsis to the emergency department. Combining qSOFA and D-dimer or PSEP improved the validity significantly. These parameters could be determined already at admission without time delay as D-dimer and PSEP could be measured as POC assays in parallel in anticoagulated whole blood samples using the PATHFAST TM system within 17 min. Introduction: Influenza constitutes a major public health problem, occurring as seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics which result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Influenza virus infection itself as well as the secondary bacterial infection-a common complication during influenza infection-often lead to severe pneumonia, organ failure, and sepsis. Typical bacterial species isolated from patients with secondary infections are common colonizers of the nasopharynx, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, primary influenza virus-mediated sepsis might occur as well. Nosocomial acquisition of seasonal influenza constitutes a serious risk among patients with underlying illnesses, the elderly and neonates. In infected adults, the highest viral replication and probable spread occur within the first 3-5 days of illness. Thus, the Robert Koch Institute recommends an isolation period for influenza patients of 7 days. However, immunocompromised persons and young children show longer periods of viral spread, exceeding the recommended isolation period. So far, diagnostic tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens include molecular assays, such as RT-qPCR and other nucleic acid amplification tests that are fast and reliable but provide limited information on the infectivity of the patient, as they do not measure the ability of the virus to replicate. Antigen detection assays often showed poor performance and are rarely used in clinical practice. In consequence, a rapid system to identify infectious virus particles is required since the existing tests for infectivity are time and cost intensive. Objectives: The influenza A virus genome consists of segmented single-stranded RNA (vRNA) with negative orientation. The eight segments are not only transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein synthesis but also used to generate a copy RNA (cRNA) which serves as a template for the viral reproduction. In consequence, three different virus-related RNAs are present within an infected cell. Based on strandspecific real-time RT-qPCR we aim to develop a rapid method to detect infectious influenza virus particles by the analysis of the three types of influenza viral RNA (vRNA, cRNA and mRNA). Methods: To achieve this goal, several approaches are performed using laboratory strains as well as patient samples which have been collected from influenza A positively diagnosed patients at day one, two, four and six upon hospitalisation. We analyse the levels of viral RNA via RT-qPCR as well as the number of infected cells by FACSanalysis upon infection of MDCK-cells. Furthermore, we aim to directly measure levels of the different viral RNAs (vRNA, cRNA and mRNA) by strand-specific RT-qPCR in patient samples. The results of these experiments are then correlated with the viral titres determined by a standard plaque assay. Results: Our findings indicate that we were able to detect different viral RNAs from laboratory strains and patient samples upon propagation in cell culture. Furthermore, we were able to monitor infected cells by FACS analysis. Different viral RNAs, as well as the number of infected cells, correlate to viral titres that were determined by standard plaque assay. While the detection of viral nucleic acid from patient samples by RT-PCR is successful, specific measurement of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA has to be improved. Conclusions: Both FACS-analysis and RT-qPCR showed promising results after infection of MDCK-cells independent of the samples used. Nonetheless, further tests are needed to optimise infection procedures and determination of detection limits. For direct analysis of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA derived from patient isolates further optimisation is required.

The blood of ICU patients is an essential source of vital diagnostic information and is used for both general and biomarkerbased laboratory analyses to support the process of clinical decisionmaking. The second domain of assessable information in blood samples is contained within the transcriptomic data of comprising immune cells. Measurement and evaluation of global gene expression is usually achieved by differential analysis of DNA microarrays. Instead of conventional statistical solutions, we here propose a new approach based on artificial intelligence which offers new perspectives in the field of sepsis diagnosis. Objectives: A pilot study for large-scale assessment of publicly available sepsis microarray data was performed using deep-learning artificial neural networks to prove their utility and superiority for precise sepsis diagnosis. Methods: NCBI GEO and EBML-EBI Array Express databases were searched for distributed data series of patients with sepsis (n = 1354), trauma patients (n = 478), and healthy controls (n = 383) and were combined in an encompassing meta-dataset. Only data series using microarray technology to analyze whole blood transcriptome data on samples drawn within 24 h after ICU admission were included. After data preprocessing, 5932 common genes were identified between all data series and selected for subsequent analyses. Available samples were randomly split into training (65%), validation (20%) and testing (15%) subsets. Samples from training and validation subsets were used to iteratively adapt deep-learning neural networks to the objective of binary classification either as ''Sepsis'' or ''Non-sepsis'' (trauma patients and healthy controls). After the training was finished, the classification accuracy for the reserved testing samples was assessed. To test the resilience, stratified ShuffleSplit cross-validation was implemented effectively, repeating the steps of random data sampling, network adaptation and binary classification for 250 times. Conclusions: Our pilot study demonstrates the superior performance of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to high-dimensional gene expression data in a use case of sepsis diagnosis.

In order to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy, the pathogen must be identified and its antibiotic sensitivities characterized. Due to several cultivation steps classical microbiological diagnosis takes up to several days from patient sample to result. Faster antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is urgently needed to avoid both, inappropriate undertreatment resulting in increased mortality in sepsis patients and the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics fostering further spread of multi-resistant bacteria. We develop a rapid cultivation-free procedure for isolation of the pathogen directly from patient's body fluid, followed by spectroscopic identification and subsequent AST. The whole procedure from urine sample to AST result takes as little as 3.5 h [1] . Here, we present a simple and fast on-chip spectroscopic technique to identify antibiotic susceptibilities and furthermore, to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bacterial isolates within 2 h. Objectives: Our aim is the development of a parallelized and automated procedure based on Raman spectroscopy in combination with a multiwell-dielectrophoresis (DEP) chip for identification and AST of sepsis pathogens within a few hours. Methods: Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive and label-free method for analysis of chemical composition, enabling measurement of biological samples in aqueous environment. A laser is irradiated on the specimen and the inelastically scattered light yields its vibrational fingerprint, which allows identification of the pathogen and comprises information of its phenotypic behavior [1, 2] . To concentrate the bacteria from patient's bodily fluids, e.g. urine, DEP is used. In an alternating inhomogeneous electric field, dielectric forces capture particles along the field lines. Utilizing a quadrupole electrode design, bacteria can be accumulated in the middle of the electrodes for direct spectroscopic characterization [3] . The novel multiwell-DEP-chip allows parallelized analysis of 20 individual conditions of bacteria-drug combinations. The test panel consists of four clinically relevant antibiotics with four concentrations permitting quantitative AST results within 2 h [4] . Results: When treated with antibiotics, spectral changes in susceptible bacteria can be observed, whereas resistant bacteria keep on growing and generate normal spectral growth signatures. The comparison of sample spectra to a database yields species identification. Principal component analysis defined spectral marker bands indicating effective antibiotic treatment. The spectroscopic approach was adapted to determine the MIC after only 90 min interaction time. The AST method using the novel multiwell-DEP-chip is demonstrated with gram-negative urosepsis pathogens, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Conclusions: We show how Raman spectroscopy can be utilized to visualize the effect of antibiotics with different mechanisms of action on sepsis pathogens with various antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Only minimal sample preparation is required and short-time cultivation of 90 min is sufficient. The combination of DEP for concentrating bacteria and Raman-spectroscopy for fast and non-destructive characterization has the potential to become a fast and reliable diagnostic tool.

As yet there is a lack of reliable and fast detection methods for sepsis aiding the treating physician to differentiate non-infectious and infectious stimuli as origin for inflammation and shock. Host specific immune response could be helpful for identifying infection as cause for organ dysfunction. Raman spectroscopy is an emerging method in the field of biomedical research with diagnostic potential. This technique provides information on the biochemical features of the cells in a non-destructive and label-free manner, which in turn enables discrimination of different cell types as well as their functional states. In Raman spectroscopy laser light gets scattered upon interacting with the biomolecules and the inelastically scattered light contains information about the molecular vibrations that are very specific to the molecule.

Introduction: Sepsis, defined as a organ dysfunction due to severe infection (1), is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide (2) . Early treatment, correct and rapid identification of offending microorganism and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is of crucial importance in reducing mortality of sepsis. (3, 4) Blood culture is considered gold standard in invading microorganism identification in sepsis diagnosis. Nevertheless, the culture takes time and is not suitable for targeted antibiotic treatment in the early stages of management of septic patient. Molecular -biological methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing could be a useful tool in improvement of appropriate and early microbiological work-up in septic patients, but they have certain limitations, namely costs and laboratory equipment. (5) Furthermore among many other septic biomarkers PCT is well established diagnostic tool to confirm or rule out suspected bacterial sepsis. But its interpretation needs to be put in the context with results of other tests, investigations and specific clinical situation. (6, 7) Objectives: The aim of ongoing study is to compare blood cultures with PCR assay for presence of microorganisms. Secondary aim is to evaluate levels of PCT at the time of clinical diagnosis of sepsis and 24 h after the first sampling considering results of blood cultures and PCR. Methods: In time of suspected or documented sepsis blood cultures were drawn. Simultaneously other blood samples were frozen for later PCR detection of infectious agent on the cooperating laboratory. PCT levels at the same time (PCT1), respectively after 24 h (PCT2) were examined. Results of blood cultures and PCR were combined and divided into 4 groups: AP (infectious agent positive), AN (infectious agent negative), AP G? (only grampositive infectious agent), AP G-(only gramnegative infectious agent). Mixed flora and fungal infection were not further evaluated. Basic statistic methods were applied to describe PCT levels in individual groups.

Thus, RAR is applied as a kind of futility monitoring which should be better addressed by planned interim monitoring without RAR. When applying RAR, one must define the decision rules for adaptation upfront of study initiation, monitor the randomisation weights to avoid instable estimates, account for time dependency of the outcome (if necessary) and has to rely on a short-term outcome. In particular, the latter have also been questioned in sepsis research. Adaptive enrichment designs are applied to identify patient (sub-) populations using biomarkers. One should distinguish between prognostic and predictive biomarkers even though some biomarkers are both prognostic and predictive (3). However, in clinical sepsis research very few biomarkers exist. Seamless designs allow moving from phase II to phase III without a recruitment stop while using all the information in a joint final analysis. In the application of seamless II/III designs, the optimal time point for transition and the adaptive changes (e.g. which arm(s) to drop) are crucial determinants of efficiency.

Conclusions: Our data strongly support TDM-guided CI of PIP as a safe strategy to significantly improve PK target-attainment in critically ill patients.

We further found evidence of both a reduction in ICU-and hospital mortality with achieving predefined target exposures of PIP. Validation through definite RCTs is, however, needed to confirm our findings. Introduction: Antimicrobials are amongst the very few drugs with perfect correlation of drug concentration and treatment effect. Optimal drug exposure aiming at predefined pharmacokinetic (PK)-targets has been recognized a key point in modern treatment of infections in critically ill patients, respectively those presenting with sepsis and septic shock [1] . While standard dosing of b-lactams in the mentioned setting is not recommended anymore [2] , customized drug-dosing of b-lactams including the principle elements of optimized infusion (continuous infusion, CI) according to substance-specific pharmacokinetics along with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided dose-adjustments has evolved as a promising and beneficial alternative [3] [4] [5] . Data on CI/TDM are promising in terms of better patient outcome and higher treatment success [3]. However, most customized strategies start individual dosing after the initiation of a-usually fixed-loading dose (LD) and infusion of a more or less standardized dose for the first 24 h. A priori approximation of individual doses using PK-algorithms is a way to start customized drug-dosing from the early start of treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 73, "end": 113, "text": "(12.0% vs. 14.6, 17.1 & 30.8%; p = .0013", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1435, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1528, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1823, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1827, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1831, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 58, "end": 66, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 320, "end": 327, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "S44 Abstracts"}, {"text": "Objectives: We hypothesized that the use of a dose-approximation algorithm prior to treatment initiation might substantially increase PK-target attainment compared to the standardized protocol (SP) used in the original study (fixed bolus and standardized PIP-dose for CI for the first 24 h of treatment).

Current therapeutic guidelines on septic patient management do not support the use of extracorporeal intraoperative cytokine adsorber in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Objectives: We report the clinical effects of an extracorporeal therapy performed with the CytoSorb \u00d2 adsorber in a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) and septic shock from infective endocarditis. Methods: A 45-years-old man with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt due to neonatal hydrocephalus, was hospitalized in Nephrology for septic shock. Blood tests showed a rapid deterioration of renal function (sCr 5 mg/dl, BUN 151 mg/dl), oliguria, anemia, neutrophil leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were 350 mg/l and PCT 7 ng/ml, respectively]. Endocarditis on mitral and aortic valve was diagnosed (multiple endocarditic vegetations, probable fistulized abscess with pseudo-aneurysm formation and dissection of the mitro-aortic junction). The patient was transferred to Cardiac Surgery Unit to undergo surgery. Due to the presence of persistent arterial hypotension not responsive to fluid therapy and vasopressors, continuous haemodialysis (CRRT: CVVHDF with citrate) was started in association with a 12-hour CytoSorb \u00d2 hemoperfusion treatment. The extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption CytoSorb \u00d2 is a novel non-pharmacologic technology, able to remove medium-size molecules such as pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. CVVHDF has been set on the Fresenius Multifiltrate system. CytoSorb \u00d2 (CytoSorbents TM ) was installed in series, downstream to the dialyzer on the same circuit. The patient underwent a double-replacement mitral-aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Subsequently, the patient continued haemodialysis treatment (CVVHDF) associated with a new Cyto-Sorb \u00d2 cartridge for a further 24 h period. Results: The preoperative use of CytoSorb \u00d2 resulted in a successful reversal of septic shock and a marked improvement in patient's hemodynamic stability in the first 48 h postoperatively. After the onset of Cytosorb \u00d2 we observed significantly less vasopressor requirements with a stabilization of the mean values of arterial pressure (MAP). Furthermore, in the following 72 h a progressive improvement of renal function (sCr 2.89 mg/dl) has been observed, along with the recovery of diuresis and reduction of inflammatory markers (CRP 105 mg/l, PCT 3.05 ng/ml), as shown in Fig. 1 .

Methods: The multicenter registry was established in 2015 on the international level. All patients diagnosed with sepsis-associated Purpura fulminans can be included except for premature neonates. Primary outcome is in-hospital mortality. A catalogue of all outcome data is provided at ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02238795).

The mean age of 42 is a result of the inclusion of two children and two adolescents, the mean age of adult patients was 54 years. Most patients were not vaccinated against meningococcei nor pneumococcei. The dominant source of infection causing sepsis and SAPF were community acquired. The spectrum of positive bacterial cultures included S. aureus and N. meningitis, Streptococcus species but also E. coli, Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In-hospital mortality was 35%.

The method is based on molecular weight and concentration dependent adsorption of cytokines, toxins and inflammatory mediators to biocompatible polymer particles with an overall surface area of more than 40,000 m 2 . Objectives: Our aim was to examine and insert additional methodes to supportive therapy in the treatment of our patient suffering from severe acute pancreatitis. Methods: A 42 year old male patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe acute pancreatitis [APACHEII: 13 Ranson score 4 (24 h) and 8 (48 h)] as a result of food abuse and hypertriglyceridemia (71 mmol/l). Along with supportive treatment (haemodynamic and respiratory support, renal replacement therapy) we applied plasma exchange on two consecutive days. Despite normalizing serum triglyceride levels the patient had deteriorating multi organ failure. Due to abdominal compartment syndrome surgical decompression was performed (open abdomen with vacuum dressing). To attenuate the ,,cytokine storm'' and remove pancreatic catabolic enzymes we used pre-filter CytoSorb \u00d2 with continuous veno-venous renal replacement therapy (with regional citrate anticoagulation) for 4 9 24 h. Results: The patient was successfully stabilized and the recovery from multi organ failure was accompanied by improving respiratory, kidney and liver function and decreasing oedema. Bilirubin and procalcitonin was excessively removed by CytoSorb \u00d2 . We experienced no clotting in the extracorporeal system and only mild and transient pH disturbances (caused by citrate/calcium dosing) during the treatment. The abdomen was completely closed by day 35, the patient was discharged from the ICU on day 41 and returned home on day 45. Conclusions: In addition to standard treatment of severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis extracorporeal removal of inflammatory mediators using CytoSorb \u00d2 contributed to the recovery of our patient.

Objectives: In the present case report, we evaluated the impact of Cytosorb \u00d2 hemoadsorption device, used as a weapon in patient-tailored therapy, on macro and micro haemodynamics. Methods: A 70-years-old man was admitted to emergency department with peritonitis, severe lactic acidosis (serum lactate: 6.8 mmol/L), and imaging was consistent with ureteral rupture after operative ureteroscopy with peritoneal purulence. He underwent a surgical ureteral repair and debridement of the peritoneal cavity. This patient was admitted to ICU with the diagnose of septic shock, SOFA score was 14, and underwent an adequate fluid resuscitation. Vasopressors were needed to treat hemodynamic instability. Microbiological samples were promptly taken and a broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was started. Procalcitonine levels were elevated: 330 lg/L. We implemented invasive hemodynamic monitoring using Picco2 \u00d2 that showed an adequate cardiac output (Ci 4.69 L/min/m2), but a reduced systemic resistance (SVRI 903 dyness/cm-5/m 2 ). We started microcirculation analysis in sublingual mucosa with a non invasive videomicroscopy technique using Cytocam \u00d2 . A perfused vessel density (PVD)of 15,17 was detected and mean flow index (MFI) was 2.58. Terlipressin was needed to treat vasoplegic shock that was unresponsive to high dosage of norephinephrine: 2 lg/kg/min The patient developed an acute kidney failure with anuria that was unresponsive to massive diuretic therapy and continuous veno-venous heamodialysis (CVVHD) was started. Admission blood essays shown severe lactic acidosis accompanied by high levels of cytochines: IL1 5 pg/ml, IL6 361 pg/ml, IL8 214 pg/ml, IL10 28 pg/ml, TNF-a 126 pg/ ml. We started a combined treatment of hemoadsorption using a Cytosorb \u00d2 hemoadsorber and CVVHD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "057"}, {"text": "Results: After 6 h of treatment we noticed a reduction in plasmatic cytochines levels: IL1 5 pg/ml, IL6 118 pg/ml, IL8 145 pg/ml, IL10 27.8 pg/ml, TNF-a 61.1 pg/ml. After 24 h of treatment we described an improved quality of blood flow: MFI 2.75 and increased PVD 16.08. Cytochines levels were reduced IL1 5 pg/ml, IL6 178 pg/ml, IL 8 67 pg/ml, IL10 34.8 pg/ml, TNF-a 38.1 pg/ml. SOFA score was 11. We extended Cytosorb \u00d2 treatment for 72 h using 3 cartridges with a restoration of macrohaemodynamic parameters. Conclusions: We present a case of septic shock with peritonitis leading to multi organ failure. The early treatment with a combination of CVVHD and Cytosorb \u00d2 led to a rapid hemodynamic and metabolic stabilization, suggesting that hemoadsorption might be an option in patient-tailored therapy of septic shock. Introduction: Sepsis is a serious complication of infection and an influential cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The use of intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin \u00d2 ) as complementary therapy in sepsis patients appears promising, but data from clinical studies alone are not sufficient to define quality standards for therapeutic use. Objectives: Aim of the registry is to assess the effects of Pentaglobin \u00d2 use on clinically relevant outcome parameters and its side effects under real-life conditions based on a prospective, high-Quality data documentation. Methods: Data collection in adult patients with severe infections began in January 2018. The participating centers collect the data via a web application on the servers of the Center for Clinical Studies (ZKS) at the University Hospital Jena. The study management software ''OpenClinica'' fully complies with the regulatory requirements (GCP, 21 CFR Part 11). Results: By March 2019, 17 patients had been included. Of these, 13 patients have already reported data on treatment and post-treatment visits. The average age of patients was 53 years. 8 patients were male, 9 were female. The majority of patients were admitted for the nonsurgical emergency. The mortality rate was 7 out of 13 patients treated. In 4 cases sepsis was identified as a direct cause of death (multiorgan failure). Conclusions: Early data show the potential of the registry, although the results must be interpreted with caution as the number of patients included is small. A future extension of the data set could help to improve clinical management of sepsis. Introduction: APRV is a widely used and highly protective modality of mechanical ventilation in severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The old-new tool for the PEEP setting strategy is esophageal manometry derived transpulmonary pressure. Although it has a plenty of the strategies, how to set up the time ratio and PEEP level, there is a lack of recommendation for time and pressure settings based on transpulmonary pressure. Our aim is to prove the transpulmonary pressure relevance under APRV ventilation in comparison of classic targets of setting (as time constant, flow analysis and volumetric method). Objectives: Inclusion criteria: We included moderate to severe ARDS cases, in adults, which are potentially have benefit from higher pressures, according to static PV curve analysis. Methods: Methods: We compared 4 different methods to determine expiration time. Flow curve analysis (targeting 70% of PEF), volumetric method (targeting 6 ml tidal volume/IBW), expiratory time constant (Tlow = 1 9 time constant). Goals: We aimed to prove the transpulmonary based method superiority over the other three methods. And analyse the effect on oxygenation (Horowitz score, Oxigenation index, volumen, intrinsic PEEP). Results: Results: We found, that all the methods improved oxygenation. The PEEP was significantly higher in the time constant guided group. The transpulmonary pressure guided group allowed lower PEEP, under the threshold of significance. But resulted better CO2 elimination, and much more physiologic pH. Conclusions: Conclusion: The transpulmonary pressure measurement has a potential benefit in APRV set up. The low number of involved patient has a limitation of the estimation of it's significance Introduction: Mortality due to septic shock is very high, particularly in patients with heart failure or septic myocardiopathy. Objectives: In this case VA-ECMO could be useful to prevent irreversible organ damage, however, lack of control of a dysregulated immune reaction may compromise survival. Association of VA-ECMO and cytokine hemoadsorption could be effective in this context. Methods: A 59-year-old male patient, admitted 20 days after inferolateral AMI complicated by cardiac arrest, underwent off-pump myocardial revascularization. Ejection fraction was 35%, therefore IABP and Swan-Ganz catheter were placed. IABP was removed on third POD, and weaning from dobutamine and mechanical ventilation were started. Hyperthermia and arterial hypotension with no modification of cardiac index (CI) showed at that moment. Nor-adrenaline and adrenaline i.v. infusions were initiated after fluid challenge (T0). Despite CI increase, systemic hypotension worsened and lactate raised (T0 ? 6 h). After 12 h the mean arterial pressure(MAP) was 50 mmHg although high catecholamine dose, and lactate reached 15 mmol/l. Renal, hepatic and coagulation dysfunctions became evident, and SOFA II score was 15 with 80% expected mortality. PCT, PCR and leucocytes raised too (T0 ? 12 h). Peripheral VA-ECMO was established to increase CI and oxygen availability (DO2I), while CVVHDF was started to replace renal function, and CytoSorbTM was installed into the CRRT circuit to prevent cytokinemediated organ damage, and restore peripheral vasomotor responsiveness. Vancomycin and gentamicin were empirically added. Results: VA-ECMO increased CI, DO2I, and MAP. The patient's heart contributed to the overall CI (T0 ? 24 h). Hemoadsorption, delivered continuously for 3 days, favored rapid clearance of blood lactate, PCT, PCR, and leucocyte count normalization, preserved liver, kidney and coagulation system, and hastened vasoplegia resolution. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were reduced and stopped on 3rd and 6th day of treatment, respectively. CVVDHF was halted in 6th. VA-ECMO was removed on 8th day, when SOFA II score was 8 with 15-20% expected mortality. The patient was weaned from ventilation and dismissed from ICU 2 weeks later. Blood cultures were negative. Stafilococcus Aureus was isolated from broncoalveolar lavage.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "057"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Care of patients in septic shock need to be tailored.

This allowed prompt reversal of the profound vasoplegia and quick removal of catecholamine, hastened clearance of lactate, PCT and PCR, and protected organs already made dysfunctional by sepsis.

Introduction: Surgery for infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with a high incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and mortality, which may be linked to increased release of inflammatory mediators during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Objectives: We therefore assessed plasma cytokine and precursor hormone profiles in patients undergoing valve surgery with or without IE. Methods: We performed a prospective case-control pilot study comparing patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery with or without IE. Plasma profiles of inflammatory mediators were measured at 7 defined time points and reported as median (interquartile). The degree of MODS was measured using sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Results: Between May and December 2016 we included 40 patients (20 in each group). Both groups showed similar distribution of age and gender. Patients with IE had higher preoperative SOFA (6.9 2.6 vs 3. 8 (0.53) nmol/L, p = 0.003); MR-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (479.49 (224.74) vs. 266.55 (308.26 ) pmol/l, p = 0.028).

Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-18, MRproADM, and MRproANP during CPB were significantly lower in survivors than in those who died. Conclusions: The presence of infective endocarditis during cardiac valve surgery is associated with increased inflammatory response as evident by higher plasma cytokine levels and precursor hormone profiles. Actively reducing inflammatory response appears to be a plausible therapeutic concept.

Primary endpoint is in-hospital mortality as compared to the mortality predicted by the APACHE-II and SAPS-II-Score, respectively. Results: Data available from the start of the registry on May 18, 2015 to June 4, 2019 were analyzed. At this time point 247 centers from 31 countries participated in the registry, of whom 37 centers from 8 countries provided data for a total of 719 patients. Mean age was 59.5 \u00b1 15.1 years, 464 (64.5%) were male. The majority of patients was admitted for non-surgical emergency, 363 (50.5%) patients, type of admission was surgical emergency for 218 (30.3%) of the patients and elective surgical for 138 (19.2%) of the patients. 663 (93.6%) had one to 5 Cytosorb adsorber applications. The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) duration of treatment was 50.0 \u00b1 66.0 h for the sepsis group (N = 394), 7.9 \u00b1 16.4 h for patients with preemptive use in cardiac surgery (N = 82), 52.1 \u00b1 41.1 h for patients with postoperative use in cardiac surgery (N = 49) and 62.3 \u00b1 61.7 h for patients with other indication (N = 183). Sepsis/septic shock was the most common indication for CytoSorb treatment (401 patients), followed by other indications (183 patients), incl. liver failure (76 patients), acute pancreatitis (29 patients), ARDS with ECMO (23 patients). 68 patients were treated intraoperatively while receiving open-heart surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Mean APACHE-II score in the sepsis/septic shock group was 29.9 \u00b1 8.7 [range 11-55]) with a predicted risk of death of 70.4%, whereas the observed mortality was 63.1%. This result for the sepsis group is supported by the high SAPS-II scores (67.9 \u00b1 18.5 [20-111]), with a predicted mortality of around 72%. There were no significant decreases in the SOFA scores before and after treatment (15.7 \u00b1 4.2 [3-24] vs. 15.3 \u00b1 5.1 ). However, IL-6 levels were markedly reduced after treatment (median 5000 pg/ml before and 289 pg/ml after treatment, respectively). Conclusions: This 8th interim report demonstrates the feasibility of the registry with excellent data quality and completeness from 37 study centers.

However, only a very small number receive psychotherapeutic treatment. Internet-based cognitive-behavioral writing therapy (IB-CBWT) has proven to be an effective treatment option for PTSD. It seems to fit the specific needs of this cohort and to overcome treatment barriers. Objectives: Aim of the REPAIR trial was to examine the efficacy, safety and applicability of IB-CBWT for PTSD in patients and their spouses after intensive care for sepsis. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned either to a treatment or a wait-list (WL) control group. The treatment group received therapist-guided IB-CBWT for PTSD comprising two written assignments per week over a 5 week period. Participants of the WL control group received treatment after a waiting period of 5 weeks. We present efficacy data for PTSD symptom severity assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) at the end of treatment/waiting time. Results: Among enrolled 34 participants, 29 (18 patients/11 spouses, mean age 55 years, 55% female, ICU stay 29 days) completed the study. Five of 16 participants in IB-CBWT prematurely terminated treatment. At the end of treatment/waiting time, there was a significantly higher reduction in PTSD symptom severity in IB-CBWT compared to WL (standardized mean difference, d = 1.90, 95% CI [1.00, 2.79], p \\ .001). Conclusions: IB-CBWT revealed large effects on PTSD symptom reduction in comparison to WL. Despite considerable efforts recruitment of participants was difficult raising the question of post-ICU accessibility of patients or spouses in need of treatment. Introduction: A large number of ICU patients and their spouses report considerable levels of posttraumatic stress after intensive care. However, current knowledge regarding the content and organization of traumatic ICU experiences is incomplete, and less is known about dyadic similarities in traumatic ICU experiences. Objectives: Aim of this mixed-method study was to explore the description of traumatic ICU memories by patients and spouses, to analyze the language used for expressing these memories, and to examine dyadic concordance in ICU experiences. Methods: ICU survivors and their respective spouses with severe posttraumatic stress symptoms were asked to give a detailed narrative of their traumatic ICU event. Trauma narratives were analyzed (1) with respect to the content using qualitative methods and (2) regarding verbal expression of emotions, cognitive processes, and other linguistic characteristics using the text analysis software program ''Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count'' (LIWC). Results: Eight couples were included. Patients (all men, mean age 52 years) were treated in intensive care for Mdn 28 days. They were married for Mdn 25 years with their respective spouses (7 women/1 men, mean age 51 years). Narratives were written by patients and their spouses Mdn 22 months after ICU discharge. Acute fear of dying (personally experienced by patients or witnessed by spouses) and strong feelings of helplessness were mentioned most frequently as worst traumatic experiences in the narratives. Conclusions: Examination of traumatic ICU experiences of patients and their spouses might contribute to a deeper understanding of ICU processes and traumatizing situations. Introduction: In January 2019 the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss-G-BA) requested Germany's central institute for quality assurance in healthcare, the so called ''Institute for Quality Assurance and Transparency in the Healthcare System'' (Institut f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4tssicherung und Transparenz im Gesundheitswesen-IQTIG), according to \u00a7 137a SGB V, to develop a report (,,Konzeptstudie'') on optimal care aspects and areas for improvement regarding ,,diagnostics, therapy and aftercare of sepsis''. The G-BA may use the developed evidence to take a decision whether to commission the development of a nation-wide quality assurance procedure for this specific care area. The developed quality assurance procedure would ultimately allow for the collection of health care data and implementation of quality indicators. Objectives: This report's objective is first, to identify sepsis-care related quality deficits and areas for improvement, second, to deduce relevant aspects of care, and finally to assess whether the identified and described quality of care issues would be effectively addressed by the available instruments that the nation-wide quality assurance procedure can offer. Methods: The methods are applied according to the institute's methods handbook (,,Methodische Grundlagen 1.1'') Results: The so called quality model (,,Qualit\u00e4tsmodell'') which provides a framework for evaluating quality of sepsis care encompasses three stages of development. The first stage focuses on the qualitative and quantitative exploration of the topic area by researching literature, guidelines, norms and regulations, by conducting expert interviews and a quantitative analysis of health insurance data. According to the G-BA's directive, patients of all ages who receive treatment as out-or inpatients are included in the study. All care phases, before and during the hospital stay as well as post discharge are considered within the framework of the study. A care pathway is developed which reflects relevant care processes highlighting critical key points as well as intersections between health care sectors. Based on the researched and generated results from literature research, data analysis, the focus groups with patients, next-of-kin and healthcare professionals, relevant quality of care aspects are deduced. Conclusively, only those quality of care aspects will be selected and suggested which adhere to the scope of the G-BA's directive and which can be measured using the available instruments that the nation-wide external quality assurance has to offer (documentation by healthcare providers, data from health care insurances, patient interviews). The nation-wide external quality assurance procedure sets standards for quality of care to be fulfilled by providers. It is therefore critical to select care topics which can realistically be influenced by health care providers as well as suggest potential for improvement. Conclusions: The study's results will provide evidence for decision makers to decide in favour or against the development of a nationwide external quality assurance procedure according to \u00a7 \u00a7 136 ff. SGB V. The final report will be published in December 2019 and give recommendations whether and if so, for which patient groups the development of an external quality assurance procedure is recommended. Introduction: The imagination of a safe place is a successful method in psychological therapy. Feeling safe is a requirement for any intervention and supports the positive effects of an intervention. Being a patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents an extreme situation which is usually accompanied by psychological distress. One of the key factors causing psychological distress is mechanical ventilation as breathing is externally controlled. Objectives: Aim of our study is to test the effects of safety suggestions in patients treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during intensive care. Methods: In a pre-post study design we tested the effects of standardized safety suggestions provided in a face-to-face setting by trained therapists. Patients were asked to rate their subjective feelings of anxiety, valence and arousal before and after receiving suggestions of safety. We further recorded physiological parameters, e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing before, during and after the suggestions. Results: Our results show that suggestions of safety significantly improve subjective well-being of patients on NIV by reducing their anxiety and arousal ratings. Conclusions: Suggestions of safety are a successful method to reduce psychological distress in ventilated patients during intensive care. Our study supports the application of psychological interventions such as positive suggestions in the ICU. Long-term effects of safety suggestions on mental health after ICU discharge have to be examined in further studies. Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction is a major and debilitating problem in survivors of severe sepsis. Patients suffer from significant cognitive problems especially in the domains of attention and executive functions. So far, effective and feasible training strategies to improve cognitive deficits in those patients have not yet been evaluated. Objectives: In the present pilot study, we aim to better characterize the cognitive deficits in patients of the Mid German Sepsis Cohort and to evaluate if these deficits can be influenced by specific home-based neuropsychological training. Methods: A controlled pre-post-test-design with two arms is used. The specific training group performs a computerized, home-based attentional speed, capacity, concentration and selection training at increasingly complex levels of difficulty and speed (adaptive to the individual user). The active control group performs a computerized unspecific training, with equivalent training duration and intensity. Training effects will be assessed as changes in visual attention parameters in post-compared to pre-training sessions measured with a psychophysical whole report paradigm based on the theory of visual attention (TVA, Bundesen 1990) and a clinically established neuropsychological battery. Results: Primary outcome is parameter visual processing speed in items per second. We will assess whether the specific training group has a higher visual speed gain than the active control group. Besides, we will evaluate if the specific training group benefits in further TVA based parameters and neuropsychological test results, compared to the active control group. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study will provide first evidence on whether cognitive deficits in sepsis patients can be improved by targeted computerized training. Reference: Bundesen, C.

Introduction: The University Hospital Dresden and the Bavaria Kreischa Hospital jointly founded the Comprehensive Sepsis Center Dresden-Kreischa in order to improve the quality of care for sepsis patients in the acute as well as in the rehabilitative phase. Objectives: By means of structured treatment algorithms and consented standard operating procedures along with joint boards and interdisciplinary discussion forums we aim at a sustainable quality improvement in the care of sepsis patient. Our primary goals are a reduction in sepsis related mortality and an increase in quality of life of sepsis survivors. We will compare the patients in the structured treatment plan with a matched cohort of patients not enrolled in this pathway in order to evaluate the benefits of this program. Methods: All patients with sepsis and septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit during the study period of 3 years will be included in the treatment pathway. It describes the cross-sectoral therapeutic concept by defining therapeutic goals in each treatment stage and determining assessment tools and therapeutic measures suitable for achieving these goals. Furthermore, parameters required to evaluate treatment success are defined. Informed consent will be obtained by the patient, a legal representative or an independent physician. We designed a database collecting over 800 variables during the whole process of care from the acute phase until discharge from the rehabilitation program. In addition, the patient's long-term outcome will be assessed in terms of independency in daily life, cognition, mental health, and quality of life. Furthermore, independent risk factors for relevant clinical endpoints will be identified as a basis for future prospective studies. Clinical endpoints are mortality, proportion of patients in need of in-patient care (re-hospitalization), mobility, cognition, mental health und quality of life after one/two/three years. In addition, parameters of process quality such as duration of ventilation, duration of tracheal cannula care, duration of renal replacement therapy, extent of wound care etc. are recorded, clinical endpoints will be analyzed by statistical tests. A follow up will be performed at fixed time points up to 3 years after discharge. Results: The clinical pathway as well as variables included in the database was consented among the participating institutions and an application for ethical approval as well as registration of this study has been filed. Conclusions: We developed an interdisciplinary, trans-sectoral treatment pathway for patients with sepsis in order to improve quality of care and outcomes. Our database will provide long-term data to identify potential risk factors necessary for clinical decisions making as well as planning of future prospective studies in this field.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2524, "end": 2527, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10217, "end": 10223, "text": "(1990)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "Trends in sepsis and septic shock mortality between 2009 and 2019, a systematic review and meta-analysis Vogelmann T (1), Preissing F (2), Stiefel J (1), Adam Blanco D (2), (1) Linkcare GmbH, (2) CytoSorbents Europe GmbH Introduction: Previous research suggested that in-hospital mortality rates of septic shock and sepsis have been reduced at a 1% yearly rate, but numerous clinical trials have failed to show an improvement in mortality. Currently, no recent and systematic overview on mortality data at 30-days or 90-days, that take into account data from RCTs and observational studies and distinguish between sepsis and septic shock, is available. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the 30-and 90-days mortality rates for sepsis and septic shock in a systematic review and meta-analysis and assess, whether a change over the past decade can be observed. Methods: We performed a systematic review of English articles published between 2009 and 2019 in MEDLINE of interventional and observational studies. We extracted the following information for each study in a standardized way: study design, enrollment start and end date, country of the study, average age, SOFA score and APACHE II of patients, enrollment of patients with severe sepsis vs. septic shock, 28-days and 90-days mortality rate for septic shock and sepsis patients. A meta-analysis of pooled 30-and 90-days mortality separately for sepsis and septic shock was performed using a randomeffects model. Time trends were assessed using the joinpoint method. Results: 4,494 records were identified in the electronic database. After title/abstract screening, 783 articles were assessed in full text for eligibility and 166 studies were included in the quantitative analysis. 80 studies reported data on 30-days septic shock mortality, 37 on 90-days septic shock mortality, 72 on sepsis 30-days mortality and 27 on 90-days sepsis mortality. Average 30-days septic shock mortality was 34.82% (95% CI 32.70-36.94%) and 90-days septic shock mortality was 38.43% (95% CI 35.43-41.53%). Average 30-days sepsis mortality was 24.62% (95% CI 21.86%-27.40) and 90-days sepsis mortality was 32.36% (95% CI 27.36-37.35%). Estimated mortality from RCTs were slightly below prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Between 2009 and 2018, we found a trend in the reduction of 30 days mortality rate among sepsis patients but no reduction in mortality rate in septic shock patients at 30 or 90 days.

In 2007, the German Sepsis Aid was founded in Jena as a non-profit-organisation for and by people affected by sepsis. Before, there were no national or international contact persons in this field, nor was there a focal point for patients and their families. The German Sepsis Aid is financed exclusively by donations, membership dues and subsidies of health insurance companies. It waives funding from pharmaceutical companies or other entities that could create a conflict of interest. Objectives: The main objective is to provide a unique platform for sepsis survivors and their families to connect, to share experiences and to find support. The German Sepsis Aid pursues the target to raise awareness for the symptoms of sepsis and to fight the often longlasting sequelae of this disease. Women and men, who are aware of sepsis from their own experience, volunteer to give practical and psychosocial assistance and information, according to the principle of ,,sepsis patients help sepsis patients''. The German Sepsis Aid can be reached by telephone helpline (?49 700-737747-00) 12 h a day, website and email. Methods: 571 counselling interviews, requested between 01.01.2017 and 19.6.2019, were analysed. Multiple requests per enquirer were evaluated as one request. Results: 60% of the requests were made via the telephone helpline, 30% per email, 8% via the website and 8% of the enquirers used other communication ways. 49% of the requesting people were relatives/guardians or friends, former sepsis patients were 37%, and others 14%. The inquiries had a wide variety. They focused on questions about long-term consequences and rehabilitation in 49% of cases followed by questions about the acute disease in 38% cases. Other inquiries, such as questions about grief assistance or contact with affected persons, were made in 33% cases. After the consultation, the German Sepsis Aid provided additional printed free information material for 30% of the help seekers. Frequently, the support is not finished after a call or an answered email, and further conversations occurred in the course of the time and the total number of contacts was 801 during the reported time frame. Conclusions: On the part of patients affected from sepsis and their relatives there is a strong need to receive information with regards to the acute disease, therapy, possibility of prognosis and rehabilitation as well as to request for support and contact with other concerned people.

The pathogenesis of diabetic foot infections in these patient populations appears to be related to ulcers and underlying peripheral neuropathy being the most important risk factors as well as existing diabetic multiorgan dysfunction risk. The major risk factors for DFS are still unclear but existing data suggest poor glycaemic control is associated with respective poor outcome. However, in most studies, the possible immunocompromising role of DFS microbiota is not regarded as an influential factor. Moreover, many studies ignore micribiota's role in sepsis development in DFS patients. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate micribiota's influence on non-specific host resistance and its role in sepsis development in DFS patients. Methods: Study involves 107 DFS patients (PEDIS grades 2-3, IDSA moderate to severe infection score).

Results: It is established that conditionally pathogenic bacteriapathogens of purulent-necrotic processes of soft tissues under DFS show suppressive effect on the phagocytosis of neutrophil granulocytes systems, decreasing phagocytic activity, phagocytic quantity and phagocytic capacity of peripheral blood of patients. The highest level of suppression of phagocytic activity was associated with S. aureus (75.58%), S. pyogenes (92.36%), R. melaninogenicus (74.75%), and P. aeruginosa (34.55%).

In this regard, the effect of differentiated use of ointments on the treatment of wounds in the second phase was studied [4, 5] . Objectives: Study the differentiated use of ointments for the treatment of infected wounds Methods: The results of the treatment of 50 patients who were admitted to the burn department for extensive purulent wounds for treatment and preparation for operations in skin plastic surgery were studied. In the first phase of the wound process, ''Baneocin'' (Sandoz) was used, in the second stage, the ''Sulfargin \u00d2 '' (Grindex) was used. The comparison group consisted of 50 patients with similar areas and depths of wounds, which used ''Bactroban'' (GlaxoSmithKine) for treatment. Results: The use of ''Baneocin'' in patients with the first phase of the wound process did not cause an increase in pain, most (43 out of 50) reported a decrease in pain intensity. As a rule, the 5th day of treatment in the wounds marked the appearance of granulation, which allowed the transition to the use of ''Sulfargin''. In the comparison group, the application of ''Bactroban'' in the first phase of the wound process did not cause an increase in pain, at the same time, the reduction in the intensity of pain associated with bandage was noted in only 2 out of 50 patients. The appearance of granulation was observed at 6-8 days of treatment. The microbial wound landscape was represented primarily by St. epidermidis, E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa ( Table 1) . As can be seen from the table, the total antibiotic efficacy of mupirocin was slightly greater than 1/3, while neomycin was effective in more than cases. Using the Sulfargin provided rapid wound preparation to skin plastic surgery. Conclusions: 1. Local treatment of purulent wounds should be conducted with differentiated use of drugs, which allows adequately affect the phases of the wound process. 2.

The registry AlertsNet (http://www.alertsnet.de), started in 2014, aims at quality assurance in BC diagnostics in the whole German Federal state of Thuringia and connects hospitals and microbiological laboratories within an electronic registry for immediate integration and evaluation of BC findings. Current data of the registry are presented.Objectives: Data of the second turn of funding are presented. Methods: Microbiological data of all BCs taken in the participating hospitals as well as clinical data from all patients with clinically relevant positive BCs collected from 01.01.2018 to 31.12.2018 were analyzed using standard measures of descriptive statistics. Results: In 2018, a total of 84,248 blood culture findings were recorded from 20 clinical settings, microbiological data were obtained from 11 laboratories and clinical data from 4 clinics. Of the BC data, 13,345 were positive (15.8%) and 70,903 were negative (84.2%). The proportion of clinically relevant positive findings was 10,915 (13.0%) after merging positive BCs of the same patient taken within 96 h, and the proportion of contaminants was 2650 (3.1%). The findings were from 22,213 patients [women: 9,444 (42.5%), men: 12,626 (56.8%), age: 73 years (median), 66.4 years average)]. Based on 975 completed electronic case report forms (eCRF), hospital mortality was 9.3% for BSI episodes with SIRS, 19.6% for sepsis, and 54.7% for septic shock. The most common sites of infection were urogenital (26.8%), pulmonal (21.7%) and intra-abdominal (14.8%). In 14.6% of cases, the focus of infection was primary bacteremia. The source of infection was nosocomial in 41.0%, community acquired in 55.0% and undetermined in 4.0%.

It is based on long lasting epigenetic and transcriptional changes, induced by microbial or endogenous molecules (Saeed et al. 2014). Yet, in the perspective of Matzingers danger hypothesis, cells of the innate immune system do not exclusively differentiate between foreign and self but also sense host derived molecules released during infection associated damage referred to as danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Matzinger 1994). Objectives: We here assessed the role of DAMPs for innate immune training in human and murine primary myeloid cells as well as in vivo in an animal model of LPS shock. Methods: Freshly isolated human monocytes were stimulated with different DAMPs for 24 h and restimulated with LPS after 5 days.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of antiphospholipid antibodies dependently of chronic CVI stages and complications appearance in patients with verified non-inflammatory thrombotic vessels pathology (NITVP) and metabolic disorders (diabetes type II complicated by diabetic foot syndrome) as a malicious background for sepsis. Methods: One hundred fifty four patients with NITVP and diabetes type II complicated by diabetic foot syndrome (DFS) were involved into the study (64 men and 90 women, mean age 58.4 \u00b1 4.1 years): 1st group included 25 patients with CVI II, 2nd group-20 patients with CVI III, complicated with cerebral ischemic stroke and AMI control group included 10 patients with CVI I. All patients were tested for presence of NITVP and CVI by Doppler ultrasonography, duplex scanning, angiography, Echo-CG, Reoencephalography, BP and ECG Holter-monitoring, clinical laboratory examination. For research purpose the antibodies to cardiolipine (AKL) isotypes IgG and IgM were typified with the standard immune-enzyme method (ELISA), titres of antibodies to myocardial, renal, cerebral and vascular intimae antigens were investigated. Standard treatment and surgical procedures according to IDF Clinical Practice Recommendations were applied. All patients had sepsis or SIRS at least once during the course of disease, making it possible to establish connections with comorbidity and septic shock risk. Results: Isotype of IgMG-AKL antibodies' increasing was revealed in 5 patients of 1st group. Isotypes of IgG-AKL and IgM-AKL antibodies were increased in 5 and 4 patients of the 2nd group, accordingly. The titres of antibodies to myocardial, renal, cerebral and vascular intimae antigens were significantly higher in the patients of 1st and 2nd groups comparatively to the control group (p \\ 0.05). Level of antibodies to target-organs antigens most closely correlated to the CVI in 2nd group (the highest correlation indices). Smaller, but still strong correlation coefficients of CVI to myocardial, renal, cerebral and vascular intimae antigens antibodies were in 1st group. Mortality among patients due to sepsis was as follows: 8 (32%) patients in group 1, 11 (55.0%) patients in group 2, and 1 (10.0%) in control.Conclusions: Data obtained in the study shows importance of comorbidity as a major factor predicting sepsis-related mortality. IgG-AKL and IgM-AKL or antiintimae, antirenal, antimyocardial and anticerebral antibodies were respective to CVI showing dependences between vascular failure, complications appearance and immune disorders in patients with diabetes type II complicated by sepsis. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of surgical approach on respiratory distress beyond pulmonary complications, oxygenation indexes (OI) of patients after right-sided thoracotomy for esophagectomy (ESO-group) are compared with those of patients after major lung resection (PULM-group). Methods: Retrospective single-center analysis of 181 patients after two-staged esophagectomy (n = 83) and major lung resection (n = 98). OI (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) was calculated perioperatively until postoperative day ten. FiO 2 of patients without mechanical ventilation was estimated being 30%. OI \\ 300 mmHg indicated respiratory distress. Discharge from intensive care unit indicated adequate respiratory function (OI C 300 mmHg). Mann-Whitney-U and Pearson's-v 2 test were used for two-group comparisons, Kaplan-Meier estimator calculated cumulative incidences. Results: The rate of reduced OI was higher initially in PULM-group (p = 0.009), and, although the thoracic part of esophagectomies was shorter as of pulmonary resections (p \\ 0.0001), patients from ESOgroup suffered more frequently from reduced OI with statistical significance at all postoperative days. In line, cumulative incidence of reduced OI was higher in ESO-group versus PULM-group (p \\ 0.001). The rate of postoperative pneumonia was higher in ESOgroup (22.9% versus 10.2%, p = 0.025) but misses significance (p = 0.1) in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Conclusions: Postoperative respiratory dysfunction depends on the surgical procedure. Beneath thoracotomy, duration of single-lung ventilation and perioperative inflammation other causes should be considered. A major difference between the two reported surgical procedures is impairment of parasympathetic branches of the vagal nerve, which may cause respiratory impairments by pulmonary edema formation.Introduction: A developing local infection in a diabetic foot is only a factor that aggravates the course of the diabetic foot and does not play an independent role in the development of this pathology [1, 2, 3] . One of the new methods used in the treatment of wounds is vacuum therapy or VAC therapy (vacuum -assisted closure). Vacuum therapy is a highly effective method of treating wounds, based on prolonged local effects of negative pressure on the wound [4, 5] . Negative pressure wound healing is an innovative technique that accelerates wound healing and allows successfully treat wounds that cannot be cured by other methods [6] . Objectives: Improving the results of treatment of patients with neuroischemic and neuropathic form DFS. Methods: Studies were conducted on the basis of the Department of General Surgery. The work is based on the results of treatment of 114 patients with purulent-necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome from 2015 to 2018. Of these, 23 patients with type 1 diabetes, 91-with type 2 diabetes. Men-49, women-65. The age of patients ranged from 38 years to 64 years. The study included patients with wounds after small operations performed and necroectomies within the foot with a depth of injury-grades II-III. According to the Wagner classification. In the structure of purulent-necrotic lesions of the feet, there was a predominance of phlegmon of the foot in 88 (77.1%) patients. Next in frequency is the gangrene of the toes of 26 (22.9%) patients. Patients were divided into two groups: control-traditional therapy was applied using ointment dressings and staged necrectomy-57 patients and the basic group-57 patients, vacuum therapy was used. The surface area of wounds ranged from 4.5 to 11.8 cm 2 and averaged 8.15 \u00b1 1.1 cm 2 . In determining the microbial landscape of the wound flora, it was found that in most cases mixed flora was observed, most often represented by St. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli. Results: In order to determine the effectiveness of this technique, we used such criteria as: the dynamics of the microbial landscape and the wound process, the timing of the wound defect closure. On the background of the treatment, there was a gradual decrease in the number of sowing microorganisms from wounds. So, in the dynamics in the control group, the frequency of detection of St. epidermidis decreased in a week by 20%, in 14 days-by 45%, and in the main group-by 26.1% and 65.2%, respectively. Cultivation of St. aureus in the control group after a week from the start of treatment decreased by 12.5%, after 14 days-by 37.5%, and in the basic group-by 25% and 75%, respectively. Wound healing in diabetes is characterized by lengthening of the inflammatory phase and inhibition of proliferation. In order to detect these changes and assess the impact of the use of vacuum therapy, we studied microscopic specimens of wound biopsy specimens. Biopsy samples were taken on days 7, 14, and 21 after the start of treatment. In the control group, in microscopic preparations taken by the end of 7 days from the start of treatment in the area of the wound defect clearly defined areas of tissue Conclusions: Gender-specific infection and sepsis incidence and case fatality rates differ between age groups. Trends observed in young infants, such as an elevated sepsis incidence in males and an increased sepsis mortality in females, disappeared or reversed in adolescence. Further research is needed to understand these differences between genders, in particular regarding predisposing comorbidities, underlying risk factors such as prematurity, and characteristics of hospital treatment.
