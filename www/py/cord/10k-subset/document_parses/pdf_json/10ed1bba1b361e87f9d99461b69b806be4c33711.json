In nonviral DAD, the reasons for the decreased mast cell density in the airways are not clear. Interestingly, no changes at the parenchymal level were observed in any of the groups. These results could be explained by our cases being mostly exudative or early proliferative cases. Liebler et al. previously analysed ARDS cases in different histological stages, reporting that mast cells were increased only at a later fibroproliferative stage, and they suggested that these cells were not implicated in fibrogenesis [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 253, "end": 257, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "IL-17 is known to be involved in the early pathogenesis of both viral and non-viral DAD, mainly due to its capacity to regulate neutrophil influx.

We found increased levels of IL-17 in both groups but surprisingly only at the small airway level, showing significant correlations with neutrophil and macrophage cell densities in ARDS group.

We were not able to include a group of patients with non-viral and pulmonary ARDS, given the heterogeneity of this group (bacterial, fungi, lung cancer, immunosuppression, etc), that would make interpretation of data difficult. Therefore, we cannot conclude about the specificity of the immune response in H1N1 cases. Furthermore, we analysed lung tissue from patients who developed severe disease, which might have presented differently in less severe cases of DAD and could explain the lack of significant clinicalmorphological correlations.
