            "text": "Volatile anesthetics have been shown to reduce lung resistance through dilation of constricted airways. In this study, we hypothesized that diffusion of inhaled anesthetics from airway lumen to smooth muscle would yield significant bronchodilation in vivo, and systemic recirculation would not be necessary to reduce lung resistance (R L ) and elastance (E L ) during sustained bronchoconstriction. To test this hypothesis, we designed a delivery system for precise timing of inhaled volatile anesthetics during the course of a positive pressure breath. We compared changes in R L , E L , and anatomic dead space (V D ) in canines (N \u00bc 5) during pharmacologically induced bronchoconstriction with intravenous methacholine, and following treatments with: (1) targeted anesthetic delivery to V D and (2) continuous anesthetic delivery throughout inspiration. Both sevoflurane and isoflurane were used during each delivery regimen. Compared to continuous delivery, targeted delivery resulted in significantly lower doses of delivered anesthetic and decreased endexpiratory concentrations. However, we did not detect significant reductions in R L or E L for either anesthetic delivery regimen. This lack of response may have resulted from an insufficient dose of the anesthetic to cause bronchodilation, or from the preferential distribution of air flow with inhaled anesthetic delivery to less constricted, unobstructed regions of the lung, thereby enhancing airway heterogeneity and increasing apparent R L and E L .",

Treatments for severe bronchoconstriction may involve inhaled b 2agonists or helium-oxygen mixtures, short-term infusions of magnesium sulfate, or more invasive techniques such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [1, 2] . A clinically relevant alternative treatment strategy is the use of inhaled volatile anesthetic agents such as halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane, since all are potent bronchodilators [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . As described in multiple case reports and small series [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , treatment with volatile anesthetics generally results in improvement within 12 h. However, these agents have been used for periods of several days in refractory cases. Volatile anesthetics have also been shown to be effective in pediatric and obstetric patients [5] [6] [7] [13] [14] [15] . Reduced hospital length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation have also been observed in patients treated with inhaled isoflurane [16] .",

Volatile anesthetics induce direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) by the reduction of intracellular free calcium via inhibition of protein kinase C, calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, or voltage-dependent calcium channels [20] [21] [22] . In addition, volatile anesthetics are known to reduce the sensitivity of the myofibrillar contractile apparatus to intracellular calcium [23] . In vivo, bronchodilation with inhaled agents depends on diffusion across the airway wall to reach their pharmacologic site of action [24, 25] . While this may be most readily achieved via luminal diffusion across the airway wall, systemic uptake and distribution to ASM is also possible via the bronchial or pulmonary circulations. Inhaled anesthetic agents also dilate airways indirectly by reducing vagal tone and reflexes, and by altering b-receptor sensitivity and circulating catecholamines [26] [27] [28] .",

The inspiratory limb of a transport ventilator (Impact Instrumentation, Inc., West Caldwell, NJ) was divided into two sublimbs (Fig. 1) . Flow through each sublimb was regulated using computer-actuated solenoid-valves (ASCO Valve, Florham Park, NJ). For targeted delivery, inspiratory flow was initially directed through the bypass sublimb. Following actuation of the solenoid valves, the inspiratory flow was then directed through the second sublimb containing a Universal Portable Anesthesia Complete (U-PAC) drawover vaporizer (Datex-Ohmeda, GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). Both sublimbs were rejoined into a single inspiratory limb that was connected to the airway opening.",

For volumes below a user-defined threshold volume (V th ), fresh gas was directed through the bypass sublimb. When the delivered volume exceeded V th , the software actuated a relay driver circuit via a D/A board. The actuating signal inverted the open/closed configuration of the solenoid valves, forcing the inspiratory gas through the vaporizer sublimb and delivering a bolus of anesthetic agent (with known concentration) in the subsequent portion of V T though the end of inspiration. Changing the minimum volume V th for which the vaporizer was engaged during inspiration, allowed us to vary the timing and duration of anesthetic delivery.",

Precise delivery of the inhaled anesthetic relies on accurate estimates of V T , which may be influenced by slow drifts, transient fluctuations, gas removal by the side-stream gas analyzer, and other minor fluxes. To minimize these inaccuracies, the numerical integrator was reset to zero at the onset of each new breath, such that V T was independent of the previous breath and any minor fluctuations.

Briefly, a volume capnogram for each breath was divided into three phases (Fig. 3) corresponding to: (I) resident gas in the conducting airways at the end of inspiration; (II) gas mixing at the interface between terminal bronchi and alveoli; and (III) gas expired primarily from the alveoli.

Isoflurane was not detectable at the interface between the medical tubing and the spring-loaded bellows, indicating that the anesthetic was constrained to the simulated dead space volume. We also found that the concentration of isoflurane within the tubing decreased longitudinally, from the airway opening to the \"alveolar\" compartment. Moreover, we importantly observed that the concentration of isoflurane at end-expiration was negligible for each sampling location, indicating that the majority of the delivered anesthetic was removed after each breath. Figure 5 summarizes R L , E L , and V D for all five dogs under baseline conditions, after maximal bronchoconstriction with MCh, at 10 and 20 min of inhaled anesthetic delivery, and following reversal of bronchoconstriction with atropine. Compared to baseline, we found that MCh significantly increased R L and E L , and decreased V D prior to delivery of either isoflurane or sevoflurane, consistent with pharmacologically induced bronchoconstriction. Examples of R L , E L , and V D for the same conditions in two representative dogs are shown in Fig. 6 . Although R L and E L did demonstrate decreases for some dogs during anesthetic delivery (Fig. 6 ), overall these changes did not result in significant differences for the population. Thus, there were no statistically significant changes for any of the parameters between the maximally constricted state and following delivery of the anesthetic agent. We also did not observe significant differences between targeted and continuous delivery for any of the measurement conditions. Discontinuation of MCh, followed by administration of intravenous atropine, returned R L , E L , and V D to similar levels to their respective baseline values, consistent with reversal of bronchoconstriction. Figure 7 shows sevoflurane and isoflurane concentrations, along with corresponding tidal volumes, for two breaths in a representative dog. Data are shown for both targeted and continuous delivery. Compared to continuous delivery, the initial increase in concentration during targeted delivery was delayed until nearly halfway through inspiration, consistent with the delivery threshold, and reached peak concentration at end-inspiration. This delay resulted in considerably lower end-expiration concentrations for targeted delivery, with profiles of isoflurane being similar. By restricting delivery to the end of inspiration, the dogs were exposed to lower doses of inhaled anesthetic for the targeted condition compared to continuous; the average inhaled anesthetic dose per breath following 10 and 20 min of targeted and continuous delivery of sevoflurane and isoflurane are summarized in Fig. 8(a) . Doses were similar across animals and were comparable after 10 and 20 min of delivery for a given agent and regimen. Similarly, end-expiratory concentrations were significantly reduced during targeted delivery, while end-inspiratory concentrations were generally similar despite a slightly increased concentration during continuous sevoflurane (Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)).",

            "text": "Inhaled anesthetics are potent bronchodilators that promote relaxation of ASM [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 13] . Their neutrally-mediated effects are important contributors to bronchodilation [26, 27] , as clinically relevant concentrations have been shown to depress bronchoconstriction induced using either nebulized acetylcholine or vagal nerve stimulation [28] , while systemic recirculation via the bronchial or pulmonary circulations may also be required for adequate delivery to under-ventilated regions of the lung [36] [37] [38] . In addition to these effects, direct diffusion of these agents from lumen to airway wall may be an important mechanism for in vivo bronchodilation. Despite their bronchodilator action, however, we observed that neither targeted nor continuous inhaled anesthetic delivery resulted in significant changes in any of the measured parameters. This is in contrast to previous reports. Ishikawa et al. showed that isoflurane and sevoflurane yielded reductions in R L and E L during MCh-induced bronchoconstriction in dogs [39] , with estimates of effect size using Cohen's d ranging between 0.6 and 0.8 for isoflurane or sevoflurane at 0.5 or 1.0 MAC. Mitsuhata et al. showed comparable effects in reversing anaphylaxis in dogs sensitized to ascaris suum [40] , while other studies have demonstrated comparable protective effects of both inhaled anesthetics in smaller species such as rats and guinea pigs with MCh-induced bronchoconstriction [41, 42] .",

            "text": "There may be several reasons we were unable to detect significant changes in R L , E L , or V D across our cohort. First, the study (N \u00bc 5) may have been underpowered compared with previous work in which considerably larger animal populations (N > 20) were used [39, 40] . Although some dogs did demonstrate positive responses to inhaled anesthetic delivery (i.e., reductions in R L and E L with increases in V D ), other dogs demonstrated no response at all (Fig. 6 ). For these nonresponders, continuous MCh infusion may have induced excessive levels of bronchoconstriction that was unresponsive to dilation with inhaled anesthetics. It is possible that these agents are more effective as broncho-protective therapy [40, 43] to prevent rather than to reverse cholinergic bronchoconstriction. Alternatively, we may not have achieved sufficient bronchodilation to result in changes in R L , E L , and V D that were substantial enough to overcome inter-and intrasubject variability in these parameters. It is possible that the total inhaled anesthetic delivered may have been inadequate to achieve equal bronchodilation in each case, either due to insufficient time of administration or delivery concentration. The previously mentioned studies report an increasing dose-response relationship for inhaled anesthetic agents such that larger reductions in R L and E L occur for higher MAC. Although we demonstrate similar peak anesthetic concentrations, these increases occur rapidly at the end of inspiration during targeted delivery (Figs. 7(a) and 7(c) ), and our ventilator-value configuration produced fluctuations between end-inspiration and end-expiration concentrations within a single breath during continuous delivery (Figs. 7(b) and 7(d) ). Thus, the total dose delivered of inhaled anesthetic with the potential to reach and act on the ASM yielding bronchodilation, especially during targeted delivery, would be smaller than that delivered using a standard anesthesia machine at comparable MAC. Finally, the single compartment model used here may oversimplify representations of the heterogeneity induced by the bronchoconstriction and be insensitive to bronchodilatory changes occurring during treatment with inhaled anesthetics as total lung resistance R L may be more reflective of parenchymal tissue resistance rather than airway resistance [44, 45] . Although both may be affected by bronchoconstricting or bronchodilating agonists [46, 47] , inhaled anesthetic delivery in animal models has been shown to cause airway dilation with little change in the parenchymal mechanics [43, 48] . Dynamic lung elastance E L may also be directly affected by pharmacologic agonism, and be further modulated by airwaytissue interdependence [35] . Therefore, more complex, robust analyses such as forced oscillatory measurements of lung impedance [30, 49] coupled with an inverse model topology [31, 50, 51] may better characterize mechanical heterogeneity compared to the single compartment model by distinguishing between distributed airway or tissue properties. Fig. 4 Isoflurane was delivered to a section of corrugated tubing ($150 ml, gray cylinder) in series with a pair of spring-loaded bellows (as shown on the right in the schematic), ventilated with tidal volume 500 ml and rate 20 min 21 : (a) characteristic trace of flow measured for two breaths; (b) corresponding tidal volume (solid) with real-time generation of actuating signal denoting anesthetic delivery window at the end of inspiration (dashed). The delivery threshold (V th ) was set to 300 ml to account for the delay in switching between sublimbs and engaging the anesthetic vaporizer; and (c) three traces of isoflurane concentration characterizing anesthetic distribution throughout the dead space compartment. Isoflurane concentration detected at the interface between dead space and alveolar compartments was negligible.",

One may further speculate that an uneven distribution of the inhaled anesthetic could have played a critical role in the observed variability between positive and negative responses during bronchoconstriction. Previous modeling studies have shown that asthma is associated with heterogeneous constriction of the airway tree, particularly in smaller peripheral airways [52] [53] [54] [55] , though imaging studies suggest that partial closure of larger bronchi also contribute [56] [57] [58] . Venegas et al. [59, 60] have shown that \"bistable\" terminal airways, which exist as either fully opened or nearly closed, can lead to poorly ventilated lung regions called ventilation defects [50] via dynamic feedback interactions involving both the central bronchi and peripheral airways [59, 61] .",

These increases in airway heterogeneity may contribute to substantial increases in apparent R L and E L as measured at the airway opening, especially at physiologic breathing frequencies [55] , which would potentially mask our ability to detect any bronchodilation resulting from direct action of the inhaled anesthetic on ASM. Similarly, MChinduced hypersecretion of mucus in the airways [62] may facilitate partial or complete airway closure and formation of mucus plugs [63, 64] , which would occlude small airways and limit the amount of inhaled anesthetic reaching constricted airways. Such an effect would limit the effectiveness of this delivery method and may have played a role in cases where R L and E L actually increased and V D decreased.",

The concept of different portions of the inspired tidal volume having variable gas concentrations is familiar to anesthesiologists using traditional \"Mapleson\" style semi-open breathing circuits [65] . In a similar study of serial gas manipulation, Brogan et al. [66] demonstrated that ventilation-perfusion matching could be improved by application of CO 2 to the conducting airways exclusively, with targeted delivery achieved by manual injection of CO 2 during the second half of inspiration. Our anesthetic delivery system advances this method by providing an automated delivery window based on volume capnography, which can be varied to match the subject's dead space volume. Such a delivery method is not possible with conventional anesthesia machines, which operate via circular breathing circuits designed to maintain a constant agent concentration. While uncommon in general clinical practice, draw-over anesthesia relies on \"pulling\" fresh gas across a vaporizer during spontaneous breathing of the patient [67] . By combining the U-PAC vaporizer in series with a ventilator, fresh gas can be \"pushed\" across the vaporizer, facilitating rapid response for targeted delivery of the inhaled anesthetic. The reduced size, compatibility with multiple agents, and operational simplicity of the U-PAC vaporizer provides an ideal method for the delivery of inhaled anesthetics in clinical settings, where there are limited options available for administration of these agents to patients [6] .",

Compared to continuous delivery, we found that targeted delivery resulted in a significantly reduced dose of inhaled anesthetic, as well as a lowered residual concentration at end-expiration (Figs. 7 and 8). This suggests that restricting inhaled anesthetics to the end of inspiration facilitated delivery to the conducting airways while decreasing systemic uptake and redistribution, which is an important consideration given that the consistent clinical use of these agents can be limited by negative systemic side effects [1] . However, a small concentration of end-tidal anesthetic during targeted delivery was still detected (Fig. 8) , suggesting that some alveolar delivery and/or uptake of anesthetic via the conducting airways may have occurred [28, 37] . Since the canine airway tree is highly asymmetric and leads to a distribution of path lengths between the trachea and terminal alveoli [61] , a delivery profile appropriate for longer path lengths would have the potential of anesthetic reaching alveoli at shorter distances relative to the airway opening. While these factors may have resulted in some systemic absorption during targeted delivery, the corresponding end-expiratory concentration was considerably lower compared to that for continuous delivery, consistent with lower systemic absorption of the anesthetics, although not directly measured here.",

Increased V D as an index of bronchodilation may be limited in cases where the lung periphery is the most dominant contributor to increased resistance [35, 47] , since the conducting airways constitute the majority of anatomic dead space. Yet we observed that changes in V D and R L were closely related during maximal bronchoconstriction and airway relaxation with atropine. Therefore, imaging modalities such as high-resolution computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging can provide further insight into the ventilation distribution and degree of heterogeneity during bronchoconstriction, while potentially resolving disparities between trends in lung resistance and anatomic dead space [31] . Additionally, these experiments focused on the dilation of constricted airways during cholinergic agonism. Methacholine has been shown to constrict the central airways predominantly, whereas an allergen-induced bronchoconstriction leads to a more peripheral pattern of constriction that can manifest through important ventilation defects as discussed previously [68] . The effects of inhaled anesthetics on this cholinergic pathway may not be similar to their effects on allergic bronchial hyperresponsiveness, for which they are known to be therapeutic [69, 70] .",

Given that this is contrary to previous work, we speculate that higher concentrations delivered to ASM may be necessary to achieve significant bronchodilation using these regimens. Protective flow redistribution and hypersecretion of mucus could have limited the amount of inhaled anesthetic delivered to constricted airways, while corresponding increases in lung heterogeneity may have led to increased apparent lung resistance and elastance in some cases. More robust estimates of lung mechanics could help to resolve these discrepancies. Nevertheless, although we were unable to detect significant bronchodilation during inhaled anesthetic delivery, our targeted delivery system indicates that it is possible to deliver inhaled anesthetics predominately to the anatomic dead space, resulting in reduced systemic dose. Thus it may be possible to achieve direct pharmacologic action on airway smooth muscle, with less potential for systemic absorption.",
