Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model, we have recently identified a network of host factors that interact with the 5= and 3= extremities of the norovirus RNA genome. In addition to a number of well-known cellular RNA binding proteins, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 was identified as a component of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Here, we show that the inhibition of Hsp90 activity negatively impacts norovirus replication in cell culture. Small-molecule-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 activity using 17-DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) revealed that Hsp90 plays a pleiotropic role in the norovirus life cycle but that the stability of the viral capsid protein is integrally linked to Hsp90 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the MNV-1 and the HuNoV capsid proteins require Hsp90 activity for their stability and that targeting Hsp90 in vivo can significantly reduce virus replication. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting cellular proteostasis can inhibit norovirus replication, identifying a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of norovirus infections.",

Given the considerable interest in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors for use in cancer therapeutics, we identify here a new target that could be explored for the development of antiviral strategies to control norovirus outbreaks and treat chronic norovirus infection in immunosuppressed patients.",

HuNoV are mainly transmitted through the fecal-oral route (4) . Although norovirus disease is usually short-lived and self-limiting, immunocompromised patients can become chronically infected, with symptoms lasting for weeks or years (5, 6) . Despite significant efforts, HuNoV have yet to be cultured efficiently in the laboratory. However, our understanding of their biology has improved significantly in recent years (7, 8) , and a recent study has demonstrated limited replication in immortalized B cells in the presence of enteric bacteria (9) . Some of these advances have been due to the discovery of a murine norovirus (MNV), which can be cultivated in cell culture (10) . Reverse-genetics approaches and small animal models for MNV have enabled better insights into the norovirus life cycle, including the identification of cellular factors and pathways involved in norovirus replication (11) (12) (13) (14) .",

            "text": "As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely heavily on the cellular pathways and processes for almost every step of their life cycle. RNA viruses typically have small genomes and therefore possess limited coding capacity. As a result, RNA viruses typically utilize numerous mechanisms to increase the information contained within their genomes. These mechanisms include the use of translational frameshifting and other novel translation mecha-nisms, as well as the incorporation of large polyproteins, which are processed to produce precursors, as well as the final mature protein products, each of which can have different functional properties (15, 16) . In addition, the genomes of RNA viruses invariably fold to form RNA structures that interact with both cellular and viral proteins to regulate many aspects of the viral life cycle. These types of interactions are known to contribute to genome replication, translation, encapsidation, and pathogenesis (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . For example, a single nucleotide change in the poliovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure leads to the attenuation of virus in a cell-specific manner (24, 25) , whereas the deletion of a polypyrimidine tract in the MNV 3=-untranslated region (3=UTR) leads to attenuation of virus in vivo (26) . The identification and inhibition of these viral RNA-host protein interactions have been shown to have the potential to control viral infections (27, 28) . Targeting a host protein has the additional advantage of a high genetic barrier to drug resistance due to the extremely low mutational rate of eukaryotic cells. In contrast, RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which lack proofreading capacity, leading to the generation of a mutant spectra referred to as \"quasispecies,\" greatly facilitating the emergence of drug resistance (29) (30) (31) .",

Given the multifunctional nature of viral proteins, it is not surprising that Hsp90 appears to play a role in the life cycles of many pathogenic viruses and that targeting Hsp90 can effectively control virus replication in cell culture (33) . In the present study, we have further investigated the role of Hsp90 in the norovirus life cycle and, in addition to our observed RNA binding activity of Hsp90, we identified that the major capsid protein VP1 of both MNV-1 and HuNoV are Hsp90 client proteins. Importantly, we further demonstrate that inhibiting Hsp90 negatively impacts norovirus replication both in cell culture and in vivo. We provide here a proof of principle that targeting a molecular chaperone may provide a therapeutic approach for treating or controlling norovirus infections.",

Many of the host proteins also identified within the network of interacting proteins are known Hsp90 client proteins (33) . To independently corroborate the binding of Hsp90 with the MNV-1 genome, we performed RNA affinity chromatography as previously described (32) , and the presence of Hsp90 was verified by Western blot analysis of the eluted fractions. Hsp90 was enriched following RNA affinity purification on the 5= as well as the 3= extremity of the MNV-1 genomic RNA (Fig. 1B) . Hsp90 was not enriched on a control RNA (N/R) or with beads alone. To determine whether Hsp90 associated with viral RNA, we examined the ability of recombinant His-tagged Hsp90 (rHsp90) to enrich MNV-1 genomic RNA from total cellular RNA isolated from MNV-1-infected cells. Positive-sense viral RNA was selectively enriched by immobilized rHsp90, as well as with His-tagged poly-PTB and the viral polymerase NS7 (Fig. 1C ). In contrast, negative-sense viral RNA was not enriched by rHsp90 (data not shown).

Pretreatment of MNV-1 with 17-DMAG had no effect on the titers of the treated stocks, indicating that 17-DMAG did not inactivate virions directly (Fig. 4A ). To examine a role for Hsp90 in MNV-1 entry or uncoating, the effect of 17-DMAG on virus replication after transfection of VPg-linked viral RNA into HEK293T cells was examined. Importantly, since human cells are not susceptible to MNV-1 infection due to lack of a suitable receptor (13), infectious titers from human cells represent a single cycle only. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity in HEK293T cells by 17-DMAG resulted in a \u03fe3-log 10 reduction in virus titer (Fig. 4B) . A similar reduction in titer was observed during MNV-1 recovery from an infectious cDNA clone in BHK cells in the presence of 17-DMAG (data not shown).

We observed that inhibition of Hsp90 activity had maximal effect on MNV-1 titer when 17-DMAG was added either at 0 or 6 h postinfection.

To define the precise role of Hsp90 in the norovirus life cycle, the effect of 17-DMAG was examined using a high-multiplicity single-step growth curve. As expected from our previous observations, Hsp90 activity inhibition using 0.3 M 17-DMAG resulted in decreased virus titer by up to \u03f33 log 10 (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, viral RNA levels were decreased only at the later stages of infection and by up to \u03f31 log 10 only (Fig. 5B) . These observations suggested that although Hsp90 activity contributes to viral RNA replication, the primary function of Hsp90 appears to be at a late stage of the viral life cycle, after viral RNA synthesis has occurred. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone, and its activity is known to be required for the correct folding of a diverse number of viral proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 activity typically leads to the specific degradation of these viral proteins (33, 53, 54) . We therefore examined the effect of 17-DMAG on the levels of MNV-1 structural and nonstructural proteins during infection (Fig. 5C ) under the same conditions where cellular protein levels were unaffected (see Fig. 4D ). The structural proteins VP1 and VP2 were almost undetectable in the presence of 17-DMAG at 12 h postinfection. As expected, due to the decrease in viral RNA levels, a minor decrease in nonstructural protein levels was also observed, although it is worth noting that not all proteins ap- (B) Novobiocin, a small molecule that interacts with C-terminal ATP binding site of Hsp90 to inhibit its activity, was used to confirm Hsp90-mediated inhibition of MNV-1. BV-2 cells were infected with MNV-1, and the medium was supplemented with novobiocin. At 12 h postinfection, samples were harvested to determine virus titers by a TCID 50 assay. (C) The cytotoxicity of 17-DMAG on BV-2 cells was determined by using a CellTiter-Blue assay, and the inhibitory effect of 17-DMAG on MNV-1 replication was determined using the TCID 50 during a high-MOI (5.0 TCID 50 /cell) infection. A concentration-effect curve was plotted. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) were calculated from the curve after nonlinear regression analysis. The concentration of 17-DMAG used during further studies is indicated as a dotted line. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the error bars represent standard deviations. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post test (***, P \u03fd 0.001). peared to be equally affected; for example, the levels of NS6 and NS7 were less affected than NS1-2. These data, combined with the observation that inhibition of Hsp90 activity has a greater impact on viral infectivity than any observed effect on RNA synthesis, suggested that Hsp90 activity contributes directly to the formation of an infectious viral particle by regulating the stability of the structural proteins.",

The MNV-1 structural protein VP1 was overexpressed in cells either alone or with VP2 from the MNV-1 subgenomic RNA. Samples treated with 17-DMAG showed a reduced level of VP1, whether expressed alone or with VP2 (Fig. 6B) , whereas the level of NS7 remained unaltered.

When Hsp90 activity is inhibited, client proteins are typically degraded via one of the several host cell quality control mechanisms (58) (59) (60) . Inhi- bition of the degradative pathway involved in the loss of VP1 after Hsp90 inhibition should therefore result in the restoration of the VP1 protein levels. We thus examined the effect of inhibition of the major cellular degradation pathways, namely, the proteasome or autophagic pathways, in order to determine whether either of these processes played a role in degradation of the MNV-1 VP1 protein upon Hsp90 inhibition. Lactacystin, a well-characterized, specific proteasome inhibitor, was used to examine the role of the proteasome in the degradation of MNV-1 structural protein VP1 after inhibition of Hsp90 activity. Treatment with lactacystin failed to rescue 17-DMAG mediated reduction in the levels of VP1 protein in MNV-1-infected BV-2 cells (Fig. 7A) . The accumulation of p21, a cellular protein continuously degraded by proteasome, was used as indicator of proteasome activity inhibition. We also investigated whether autophagy was involved in 17-DMAGmediated reduction in the levels of VP1 using Atg5 knockout BMDMs. MNV-1 replicated to similar titers in both Atg5-deficient (Atg5 flox/flox\u03e9LysMcre ) and wild-type (Atg5 flox/flox ) BMDMs (34) . Inhibition of Hsp90 activity using 17-DMAG reduced virus titers significantly in both Atg5-deficient and wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 7B) . Similarly, the levels of viral protein VP1 were not rescued in Atg5-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 7C) . These results indicated that Hsp90 inhibition-mediated degradation of MNV-1 protein VP1 is not mediated via either proteasome or autophagy. Further-more, VP1 protein translation occurred in the presence of 17-DMAG (data not shown), suggesting MNV-1 VP1 is most likely degraded by a nonproteasomal and nonautophagy pathway. However, identification of the degradation pathway for VP1 requires further investigations.",

MNV-1 proteins and murine hsp90\u2423 were expressed in fusion with either protein A (bait) or Renilla luciferase (prey). The expressed proteins were pulled down using IgG, and the interacting fusion Renilla luciferase activity was measured. The assay was performed using Hsp90 as both prey and bait. The robust z scores were calculated to measure the significance of interaction. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the error bars represent the standard deviations.

Neutral red-containing virus becomes light sensitive as exposure to light causes cross-linking between the viral RNA genome and the protein coat (42) . 17-DMAG was administered to BALB/c mice intraperitoneally as a single bolus prior to infection, and the effect on virus replication in the intestine was examined. The effect of Hsp90 activity inhibition on viral replication in the distal ileum, the primary site of MNV-1 replication in vivo, was determined (35, 42) . Mice treated with 17-DMAG showed a significant decrease in virus titers compared to vehicle control-treated mice (Fig. 8) .

Actively replicating, as well as total, MNV-1 titers were significantly reduced. Statistical analysis was performed by using a Student t test (ns, nonsignificant; **, P \u03fd 0.01; ***, P \u03fd 0.001). Error bars represent the standard deviations.",

(A) A Lumier assay was used to detect direct interaction of Hsp90 with HuNoV proteins in 293T cells, as stated in Fig. 6 . HuNoV proteins and human hsp90\u2423 were expressed in fusion with either protein A (bait) or Renilla luciferase (prey). The expressed proteins were pulled down using IgG, and the interacting fusion Renilla luciferase activity was measured. The robust z scores were calculated to measure the significance of interaction. The assay was performed in both directions. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the error bars represent the standard deviations. (B) HuNoV structural protein VP1 was expressed in BSR-T7 cells and tested for the ability to degrade in the presence of 17-DMAG. An Hsp90 client protein, Akt, and GAPDH were used as positive and loading controls, respectively. of inhibiting Hsp90 activity on VP1 levels when overexpressed in cells. Cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the Norwalk virus subgenomic RNA, encoding both VP1 and VP2, and the effect of 17-DMAG on VP1 levels was examined. As expected, inhibition of Hsp90 activity caused a significant reduction in the levels of the Norwalk virus VP1 protein (Fig. 9B) . Taken together, these data independently corroborated that the HuNoV structural protein VP1 is also an Hsp90 client protein.",

In the present study, we showed that Hsp90 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention against noroviruses. Using Hsp90 inhibitors, we demonstrated that the major role of Hsp90 activity in the norovirus life cycle is during genome encapsidation. We confirmed that the MNV capsid protein VP1 is a client protein of Hsp90 and that inhibition of Hsp90 activity causes VP1 degradation, most likely due to an inability to fold correctly. VP1 degradation results in an inability of MNV-1 genomes to be encapsidated and a significant reduction in the production of infectious virions. We have further shown that HuNoV capsid protein VP1 also interacts with Hsp90 and that inhibition of Hsp90 activity leads to the degradation of HuNoV VP1. Furthermore, we have confirmed Hsp90 activity is required for norovirus replication in vivo. Therefore, we propose that Hsp90 may provide a viable therapeutic target for the control of norovirus infections.",

Several factors, including high infectivity of norovirus particles, the persistence of noroviruses in the environment, a lack of lasting immunity, and prolonged shedding of virus from infected individuals, contribute to the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks (63, 64) . HuNoV infection usually presents as an acute and self-limiting disease; however, norovirus infection in infants and young children can develop into more severe gastroenteritis, with symptoms lasting up to 6 weeks (3, 65) . Although many vaccine candidates have undergone clinical trials against noroviruses (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) (71) (72) , the extreme genetic heterogeneity within the virus family, a lack of intergenogroup cross-protection, and rapidly emerging variant strains make generating a cross-protective vaccine a challenging, although not impossible, task. Vaccination is also not a suitable prevention strategy for immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients, who often suffer from long-term norovirus infections lasting months to years. Therefore, the development of antiviral strategies for such patient cohorts is of great interest. Several efforts have been made to develop antiviral drugs against noroviruses (63, (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) . Inhibitors targeting the viral genome or proteins have been tested in both cell culture and mouse models for their ability to inhibit norovirus replication (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) . Small molecule inhibitors of cellular pathways have also been shown to inhibit MNV replication in vitro and in vivo; hippuristanol, a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A, has been shown to inhibit MNV RNA translation and virus replication in cell culture (27) , whereas a small molecule inhibitor of deubiquitinases can also inhibit MNV replication in vivo (78) . Despite these efforts, no antiviral therapies are available to treat norovirus infections.",

In contrast, strategies designed to target host factors required for viral replication not only have the potential to act on a wider range of viruses due to common mechanisms of replication but also have a higher barrier to the development of resistance. This cellular targeting approach is gaining more enthusiasm and several such host factors, required by many viruses, have now been screened for inhibitors that may have broad-spectrum antiviral activity (27, (78) (79) (80) (81) .",

Hsp90 is a highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperone required for the conformational maturation of numerous client proteins, enabling them to carry out their biological functions (33, 82, 83) . In addition, Hsp90 is required for the function of a large number of multiprotein complexes (84) (85) (86) . Hsp90 plays an important role in the replication of a broad range of both DNA and RNA viruses (33) . For example, in hepatitis C virus Hsp90 is essential for NS2/3 protease activity and stabilizes the NS3 protein (87, 88) , and in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Hsp90 controls reactivation from latency (89) , whereas in poliovirus Hsp90 is required for maturation and processing of the capsid protein precursor (P1) (49) . Nonstructural proteins of MNV are encoded in a single open reading frame. However, the levels of some nonstructural proteins were affected more than others (e.g., compare levels of NS1/2 and NS3 in Fig.  5C ). However, given a minor effect on viral RNA levels, but a major effect on infectious virus production, we focused our studies on the structural protein VP1. Our data, presented in Fig. 6 and 9, indicate that the structural protein VP1 of MNV and HuNoV are client proteins of Hsp90. The specific sequence requirements for the interaction of Hsp90 with the MNV-1 RNA are beyond the scope of the present study and will require further investigations; however, they fit with previous observations of RNA binding activity observed with bamboo mosaic virus (46) . Hsp90 has previously been shown to interact with the genomic RNA of bamboo mosaic virus (46) . The interaction of Hsp90 with a structural RNA motif in the 3=UTR of the bamboo mosaic virus genomic RNA conferred its requirement for bamboo mosaic virus but not for bamboo mosaic virus-associated satellite virus. The role of the observed RNA binding activity in the norovirus life cycle also remains to be determined. It is possible that an interaction with viral RNA functions to recruit Hsp90 to newly synthesized viral RNA where it may then recruit VP1 subunits to initiate genome encapsidation. Further studies are clearly required to delineate the precise role of the RNA binding activity.",

For example, a viral structural protein must adopt a precursor conformation that is soluble, but hundreds to thousands of such protein units must then be orderly assembled into a capsid formation in the presence of viral genome that remains infectious despite extreme thermal and chemical conditions (90) . The requirement of Hsp90 activity for pathways associated with cancer-ous cell proliferation has driven the development of inhibitors targeting Hsp90 activity (47, 91) . The most effective inhibitors are based on the ansamycin antibiotic GA, which prevents ATP binding to Hsp90, rendering it inactive. There has been enormous interest in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors with an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of several cancers (47) , and should any of these possess the correct toxicity profile, we would suggest that there is a possibility to repurpose these Hsp90 inhibitors against noroviruses.",

We extended this work to demonstrate that Hsp90 activity is also required for the HuNoV capsid protein stability, identifying Hsp90 as a common cellular component contributing to the norovirus life cycle. Further work is required to explore the utility of Hsp90 as a potential therapeutic target against these clinically important pathogens. ",
