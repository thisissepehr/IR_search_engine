We hypothesized that IFN-l3 polymorphism may modulate NK cell function during acute HCV. Methods: We monitored the plasma levels of type III IFNs in relation to the phenotype and the function of NK cells in a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) during acute HCV infection with different outcomes. Results: Early acute HCV was associated with high variability in type III IFNs plasma levels and the favorable IFN-l3 CC genotype was associated with higher viral loads. Reduced expression of Natural Killer Group Protein 2A (NKG2A) was associated with lower IFN-l3 plasma levels and the CC genotype. IFN-g production by NK cells was higher in individuals with the CC genotype during acute infection but this did not prevent viral persistence. IFN-l3 plasma levels did not correlate with function of NK cells and IFN-l3 prestimulation did not affect NK cell activation and function.

Acute infection outcome is determined by the interplay between the virus, the virus-specific immune response, and the host genetics such as polymorphisms in the IL28B/IFN-l3 locus (encoding for the type III interferon IFN-l3), the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and HLA-C genes controlling the function of natural killer (NK) cells (reviewed in [1, 2] ). Types I and III IFN responses are induced early during acute HCV. IFN-l3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12979860) was associated with spontaneous HCV clearance [3, 4] with the favorable genotype designated as CC and the non-favorable as TT. This SNP is located upstream of the IL28B (IFN-l3), IL28A (IFN-l2), and IL29 (IFN-l1) genes and it was postulated that it may control the transcription or the expression levels of type III IFNs but no clear association was established (reviewed in [5] ). Type I IFNs were minimally detected in the liver and plasma of chimpanzees during acute HCV infection [6, 7] . In contrast, type III IFNs were strongly induced and their expression levels correlated with ISG expression in the liver and viremia in acutely infected chimpanzees [6] . In humans, IFN-l1 was higher than IFN-l2/3 during acute HCV and correlated with spontaneous resolution of HCV [8] . IFN-l3 rs12979860 SNP is in linkage disequilibrium of the coding sequence of another SNP upstream of IL28B controlling the expression of a relatively new member of the type III IFN family, IFN-l4, where reduced IFN-l4 activity was associated with improved HCV clearance and reduced expression of ISGs [9] [10] [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 465, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 466, "end": 468, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 641, "end": 644, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 645, "end": 647, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 970, "end": 973, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1082, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1085, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1256, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1372, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1679, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1684, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1689, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "NK cells are one of the earliest innate immune effectors against viral infections and are enriched in the liver (reviewed in [12] ).

Activity of NK cells is controlled by a combination of activating and inhibitory receptors including KIRs, lectin-like (NKG2A-E), and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46) (reviewed in [13] ). NK cells are activated and may contribute to protection in HCV-exposed uninfected individuals [14, 15] . NK cells were activated in peripheral blood during acute HCV infection irrespective of infection outcome [16] [17] [18] and NK cell activity correlated with the magnitude of adaptive T cell responses suggesting that cross-talk between the two arms of the immune system is an important determinant of the infectious outcome [17] . Polymorphism in both IFN-l3 and KIRs synergize to predict the outcome of acute infection or response to IFN-based therapies [19, 20] and altered NK cell effector functions in chronic hepatitis C were associated with IFN-l3 polymorphism [21] suggesting an active role for IFN-l3 in NK cell activation. IFN-l3 was also recently reported to influence response to an influenza vaccine [22] , underscoring the influence of IFN-l3 on innate and/or adaptive immune responses.

However, studies reported controversial results about the expression of IL28Ra on different lymphocytes subsets [19, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and their subsequent ability to respond directly to IFN-l3 stimulation. To elucidate these controversies, we tested whether IFN-a might directly affect the expression of IL28Ra on different lymphocytes subsets (Fig. 4) . IL28Ra was highly expressed on DC (Fig. 4A ) and monocytes ( Fig. 4B and to a much lesser extent on CD56 dim NK cells (Fig. 4C ) and CD56 bright NK cells (Fig. 4D) . Stimulation of these different lymphocyte populations with IFN-a did not significantly affect the expression of IL28Ra and may have even induced its slight down-regulation.

We stimulated whole PBMCs and purified NK cells from healthy donors (n \u00bc 10) with IFN-l3. We monitored changes in the expression of the surface receptor NKG2A and the specific subunit of the type III IFN receptor, IL28Ra by NK cells as well as the capacity of NK cells to degranulate in response to K562 cells and their IFN-g production before and after IFN-l3 stimulation.

We had previously reported that our cohort of PWIDs of a French Canadian origin had a higher representation of the CC and CT genotypes and reduced representation of the TT genotype as compared to other cohorts due probably to a strong genetic founder effect in that population [33] . As such, we had very few subjects in the present study who were homozygous for the non-favorable T allele (TT), so we had to group our TT subjects with the heterozygote CT subjects in one category as \u00c3 T which may have influenced some of the results. Finally, induction of IFN-l3 mRNA in PBMCs following stimulation with Poly I: C was shown to correlate with polymorphisms in IFN-l4 rather than IFN-l3 genotypes [10] .

Another key factor is the expression of the specific IL28Ra/ IFNlR1 on NK cells that has been a controversial issue. Overall, we observed low levels of receptor expression on NK cells and unlike hepatocytes [37] this expression was not modulated by stimulation with either IFN-a or IFN-l3. Furthermore, IFN-l3 cytokine did not directly stimulate degranulation or IFN-g production by NK cells. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that IFN-l3 may regulate NK cell differentiation or other functions. Indeed, IL28R was required for optimal NK cell activity in vivo [29] . Additional assays are required to precisely assess the responsiveness of NK cells or other IL28Ra expressing cells to IFN-l3. Indeed, DCs and monocytes were shown to prime the activation of NK cells through direct interaction and/or production of different cytokines like IL-12 [45, 46] . When we examined expression of IL28Ra on different lymphocyte populations, we observed higher expression of this receptor on DCs and monocytes as compared to NK cells prior to stimulation with IFN-l3 or IFN-a, but there was no change in the level of expression following the stimulation. Recent reports suggest that IL-12 and/or IL-18 production by monocyte-derived macrophages could act as the link between type III IFNs and activation of NK cells [26] and that this effect may be IFN-l3 genotype dependent [47] .
