Influenza antiviral therapy (Table 6) should be administered as soon as possible to children with moderate to severe CAP consistent with influenza virus infection during widespread local circulation of influenza viruses, particularly for those with clinically worsening disease documented at the time of an outpatient visit. Because early antiviral treatment has been shown to provide maximal benefit, treatment should not be delayed until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially rapid antigen tests, do not conclusively exclude influenza disease. Treatment after 48 hours of symptomatic infection may still provide clinical benefit to those with more severe disease. (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence) Inpatients 46.

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document that in 2006, 525 infants and children ,15 years old died in the United States as a result of pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections [10] . The reported incidence of pneumonia in children, both pathogen specific and as a general diagnosis, varies across published studies based on definitions used, tests performed, and the goals of the investigators. CAP in children in the United States, the focus of these guidelines, is defined simply as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that has been acquired outside of the hospital [11, 12] . However, pneumonia definitions can also be designed to be very sensitive for epidemiologic considerations (eg, fever and cough) or very specific, as defined by government regulatory agencies for approval of antimicrobials to treat pneumonia (eg, clinical symptoms and signs in combination with radiologic documentation or microbiologic confirmation) [13] . Pneumonia, broadly defined as a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), may also be defined in a way that is clinically oriented, to assist practitioners with diagnosis and management.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 101, "end": 104, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 105, "end": 107, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 553, "end": 556, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 794, "end": 797, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 948, "end": 951, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1636, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1640, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1993, "end": 1997, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Burden of Disease"}, {"text": "Many pathogens are responsible for CAP in children, most prominently viruses and bacteria [6, 7, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .

''Complicated pneumonia'' is defined as a pulmonary parenchymal infection complicated by parapneumonic effusions, multilobar disease, abscesses or cavities, necrotizing pneumonia, empyema, pneumothorax or bronchopleural fistula; or pneumonia that is a complication of bacteremic disease that includes other sites of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Guidelines and Conflict of Interest"}, {"text": "For resource-poor regions of the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines pneumonia primarily as cough or difficult breathing and age-adjusted tachypnea: (age 2-11 months, $50/min; 1-5 years, $40/min; $5 years, .20 breaths/min) [5] .

When an empyema is present, drainage of purulent material is usually required for adequate treatment of the infection. Drainage of infected pleural fluid may result in decreased fever, inflammation, and hospital stay [240, 241] . Finally, the size of the effusion and the degree of respiratory compromise are important factors to be considered when determining the management plan.

Abnormalities in lung function are common, but no consistent pattern of abnormalities exists, and the sample sizes are too small to enable meaningful comparisons between drainage procedure and lung function abnormalities.

What Laboratory Testing Should Be Performed on Pleural Fluid? XII. What Are the Drainage Options for Parapneumonic Effusions? 65. Moderate parapneumonic effusions associated with respiratory distress, large parapneumonic effusions, or documented purulent effusions should be drained. (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence) 66. Both chest thoracostomy tube drainage with the addition of fibrinolytic agents and VATS have been demonstrated to be effective methods of treatment. The choice of drainage procedure depends on local expertise. Both of these methods are associated with decreased morbidity compared with chest tube drainage alone. However, in patients with moderate-to-large effusions that are free flowing (no loculations), placement of a chest tube without fibrinolytic agents is a reasonable first option.

Increased degree of parenchymal involvement, presence of or increase in pleural fluid, or development of pulmonary abscess or necrotizing pneumonia, as documented by imaging with chest radiography, ultrasound, or CT.Children with nonresponding CAP should have the clinical severity of their condition repeatedly assessed to determine whether they require higher levels of care, for example, admission to the hospital from the outpatient setting, skilled transport from a community hospital to a tertiary pediatric care center, or transfer to the ICU from a hospital ward. The evaluation should include monitoring for the expected improvements in presenting findings that may include fever, respiratory rate, respiratory distress (chest retractions, grunting), and hypoxemia (with pulse oximetry). Children should also be monitored for their global response in terms of activity, appetite, and hydration status. Some outpatient ''nonresponders'' will require hospitalization (see Evidence Summary for Recommendation 1) if they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation or hydration or show signs of increased work of breathing or toxicity. Children treated initially with oral antibiotic therapy for presumed bacterial or atypical pneumonia as outpatients may actually be infected by pathogens not susceptible to initial therapy, and may require alternative or additional antibacterial or antiviral therapy.Children with nonresponding CAP that is moderate to severe should undergo radiographic imaging, particularly if clinical evidence suggests increased respiratory effort, increased areas of abnormal lung sounds, or dullness to percussion in areas where it was not detected previously.
