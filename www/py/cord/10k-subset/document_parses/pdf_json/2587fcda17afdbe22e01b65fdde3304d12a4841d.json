Danger signals (pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as infections or environmental chemical factors) are transmitted to macrophages and neutrophils through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which excessively activate the NACHT, LRR and PYD domainscontaining protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in patients with a predisposing genetic background. This excessive activation of NLRP3 seems to be central and leads to intense production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. These cytokines intensely stimulate innate immune cell activation, as well as adaptive immune cells, leading to overproduction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNF, as well as further production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Several factors actively contribute to this amplified inflammatory response, which is often referred to as the cytokine 'burst' or 'storm'. In addition to IL-1\u03b2 itself conferring retrograde activation of macrophages and neutrophils, alarmins such as the S100 proteins and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved. Aside from the amplification mechanisms, deficiency or failure in regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases, including deficiency in regulatory T (T reg ) cells or natural killer (NK) cells, insufficient IL-10 production and deficiency in production of resolving lipid mediators, soluble receptors of AGEs (sRAGEs) or other resolution-associated molecular patterns (RAMPs).

Although hyperferritinaemia was first considered suggestive of AoSD, several studies have shown that hyperferritinaemia, whatever the threshold used, has a poor positive predictive value in isolation without a suggestive context 54, 55 . Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that conditions such as AoSD, RHL, catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome and septic shock should be included under a common syndrome entity termed 'hyperferritinaemic syndrome' to underline the pro-inflammatory function of ferritin 56 . Indeed, ferritin has been hypothesized to have a pathogenic function: high serum levels of this protein, as detected in these four clinical conditions, might contribute to the development of a cytokine storm 57, 58 . Indeed, in hepatic stellate cells, exogenous ferritin has been shown to activate the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling pathway, leading to pro-inflammatory (including IL-1\u03b2) cytokine production 58 . High ferritin levels have also been shown to contribute to the development of a cytokine storm through a loop mechanism in which the inflammatory properties of ferritin are exacerbated 14 during inflammation result from increased production by histiocytes and macrophages and increased release from damaged hepatocytes. Many cytokines regulate the ferritin synthesis, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, TNF, IFN\u03b3 and IL-6.
