            "text": "Acute respiratory disease is one of the most common reasons to consult a general practitioner. A substantial part of these diseases cannot be explained by an infection with a virus or a common pathogenic bacterium. To study this diagnostic de\u00aecit, the prevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections was determined in two groups of patients consulting a general practitioner. DNA of C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae was detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nose/throat swabs from six (1.1%), and from seven (1.3%) patients, respectively, of 557 patients consulting a general practitioner for complaints suggestive for a virus infection during the 1994/1995 respiratory infections season. Two patients remained C. pneumoniae PCRpositive for at least 4 weeks. All others were negative within 3 weeks. Double infections of C. pneumoniae and in\u00afuenza virus (3/6), and of M. pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus (1/7) or rhinovirus (1/7) were diagnosed. During the 1992/1993 season, attempts to isolate C. pneumoniae in cell culture or to detect C. pneumoniae DNA by PCR using throat swabs were all negative for 80 patients with a sore throat, although serological data suggested a C. pneumoniae infection in 13 (16%) patients. A specimen from another patient of this group was M. pneumoniae PCR-positive and the corresponding serum specimens showed a persistent high antibody titre. In summary, the prevalence of acute C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae infections was less than 2% in patients consulting a general practitioner.",

            "text": "Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been recognised as important respiratory tract pathogens [1\u00b13] . Most C. pneumoniae infections are thought to be asymptomatic [1] . Nevertheless, approximately 10% of all pneumonia cases, 5% of all bronchitis and sinusitis cases, and 2\u00b18% of all pharyngitis cases have been attributed to C. pneumoniae [1] . Furthermore, C. pneumoniae infections have been associated with new-onset asthma and exacerbation's of chronic asthma, and, recently, also with coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [1] . Some studies have indicated about one-\u00aefth of all M. pneumoniae infections is asymptomatic [2] . Most symptomatic infections (77%) are characterised by respiratory illnesses such as pharyngitis and tracheobronchitis and only a minor fraction (3%) by pneumonia [2, 3] . Complications associated with M. pneumoniae infection include arthritis, pleuritis, anemia, peri-and myocarditis, and encephalitis [3] . The clinical characteristics of patients presenting with serious respiratory infections caused by C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, viruses, or unidenti\u00aeed agents, are very similar [4, 5] . Among respiratory illnesses, sore throat is one of the most common reasons to consult a general practitioner. Generally, diagnostic tests are not performed in Dutch general practices and the decision to treat patients is based mainly on clinical signs and symptoms. Recently, the clinical entity`sore throat' was investigated in Dutch general practice [6] . In that study, laboratory diagnosis of infection with C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae or viruses was not carried out. Seventy percent of the patients (n 598) had positive cultures for pathogenic bacteria, of which 68% were b-haemolytic streptococci. For that reason, sore throat is often treated blindly with penicillin. However, these antibiotics are not eective against C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae. Thus, since C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae may be involved [4] , some patients may receive inappropriate treatment and may be at risk for developing complications associated with C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae. In this report, we extend the study of the aetiology of sore throat to C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae in patients visiting a general practice.",

The throat swab of one of these patients (female, age 13 years) was positive for M. pneumoniae in the PCR assay, whereas the throat swab of the other patient (female, age 30 years) was negative. Both patients showed no indication of a recent infection with C. pneumoniae by serology, culture or PCR assay. The throat swabs of all other patients were negative for M. pneumoniae in the PCR assay. All throat swab specimens were positive in the b-globin PCR assay.",

Since our largest group of patients was recruited from general practices providing health care for about 1% of the Dutch population [7, 8] , distributed over the whole country and proportionate to the population density, we can conclude that approximately 1% of the patients presenting with a virus infection-like acute respiratory illness in Dutch general practices have a C. pneumoniae or a M. pneumoniae infection. Although serological data a Optical density value of the acute specimens was just below and that of the convalescent specimen was just above the cuto optical density value. Table 2 . Summary of serological data for C. pneumoniae of 80 patients presenting with a sore throat in Dutch general practices during the 1992/1993 season suggested a prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections of 16% in a subgroup, this \u00aending could not be con-\u00aermed by detection of the agent. In 33% of our patients from the sentinel practices respiratory viruses were detected, in three cases together with C. pneumoniae and in another two cases together with M. pneumoniae. Previously, Dagnelie et al. [6] showed that 70% of similar patients carried pathogenic bacteria in their throats. Coexistence of C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae and other agents have been described before [4] . In these patients, it is dicult to assess the relative contributions of the two agents to the respiratory complaints. Animal models even suggest reactivation of a latent C. pneumoniae infection [20] . In agreement with previous reports [2, 4, 5] , clinical characteristics were similar for viral, chlamydial and mycoplasmal infections.",
