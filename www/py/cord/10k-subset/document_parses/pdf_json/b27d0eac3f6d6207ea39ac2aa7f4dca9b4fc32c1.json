In this paper, we are addressing the issue of spreading public concern about epidemics. Public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own. Keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks. However, monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems, but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays. To address these problems, we are using Twitter messages, which are available free of cost, are generated world-wide, and are posted in real time. We are measuring public concern using a two-step sentiment classification approach. In the first step, we distinguish Personal tweets from News (i.e., Non-Personal) tweets. In the second step, we further separate Personal Negative from Personal Non-Negative tweets. Both these steps consist themselves of two substeps. In the first sub-step (of both steps), our programs automatically generate training data using an emotionoriented, clue-based method. In the second sub-step, we are training and testing three different Machine Learning (ML) models with the training data from the first sub-step; this allows us to determine the best ML model for different datasets. Furthermore, we are testing the already trained ML models with a human annotated, disjoint dataset.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Based on the number of tweets classified as Personal Negative, we compute a Measure of Concern (MOC) and a timeline of the MOC.

Many news articles released by online media organizations are used for 're-tweets' by Twitter users.

As previously discussed, the traditional Twitter sentiment classification methods classify the tweets into positive/ negative or positive/neutral/negative. Our two-step algorithm is different from the traditional methods because it filters out the Personal tweets and News tweets in the first step, and then the Personal Negative tweets are used for defining a MOC. To the best of our knowledge, while previous research has extracted objective tweets, it has not explicitly extracted the News tweets, and has not utilized Personal Negative, Personal Non-Negative, and News tweets to define a MOC to quantify the sentiment trends on the timeline. Thus, using this novel method, one can combine the sentiment classification results into a MOC to reveal the sentiment timeline trends. 2. We quantified the MOC using the results of sentiment classification, and used it to reveal the timeline trends of sentiments of tweets. We both quantitatively and qualitatively correlated the sentiment timeline trends and the News timeline trends, and calculated the correlation between MOC timeline and News timeline and the correlation between Non-Negative timeline and News timeline using the Jaccard Coefficient. We performed the correlation analysis among different tweet sentiment classes. The experimental results show that the peaks of the MOC and the peaks of NN (Non-Negative) tweets are weakly correlated with the peaks on the News timeline without any appreciable time delay/lead. 3.

(2011) introduced the concept of dialogical emergency management, which emphasizes the screening of vast and quickly spread information on the Internet, to help the emergency management staff gain a better strategic awareness of the public. The Alert4All Screening of New Media (SNM) tool (Johansson et al. 2012) was developed based on this concept to analyze emotion recognition/affect in social media, e.g., Twitter and Facebook, regarding crisis management. Brownstein et al. (2008) used online News to perform surveillance of epidemics. Their system, Healthmap, collects reports from online News aggregators, such as Google News. By categorizing the News into epidemics-related and epidemics-unrelated reports, and filtering the epidemics-related documents into ''breaking News'', ''warnings'', and ''old News'', the system is able to trigger alerts based on ''breaking News''. To detect disease outbreaks and monitor their progression over time and location, we have previously implemented the Epidemics Outbreak and Spread Detection System (EOSDS) (Ji et al. 2012 ) by monitoring social media data (specifically, Twitter data). EOSDS provides the functionality to perform geographic visual analysis of tweets with three different kinds of maps. The static map shows each individual tweet's location.

We attempt to solve a different problem, which is how to classify tweets into three categories: Personal Negative tweets, Personal Non-Negative tweets, and News tweets (tweets that are non-Personal tweets). We are not singling out positive tweets, as few people would post positive tweets about a spreading epidemic. Instead of identifying News tweets, Brynielsson et al.

Salathe and Khandelwal (2011) also identified irrelevant tweets together with sentiment classifications. Without considering irrelevant tweets, they calculated the H1N1 vaccine sentiment score from the relative difference of positive and negative messages. As we will show later, by the two-step classification method, we can automatically extract News tweets and perform the sentiment analysis, and the results of sentiment classification are the input for computing the correlation between sentiments and News trends.

Similar research was done by O'Connor et al. (2010) . In their thread of research, they quantified the sentiments as a timeline by deriving a day-to-day (positive and negative) sentiment score simply by counting how many positive and negative words of one tweet appear in the subjectivity lexicon of OpinionFinder (Wilson et al. 2005) , which is a list containing words marked as positive or negative.

We extracted three test data subsets by random sampling from all tweets from the three domains epidemic, clinical science, and mental health, collected in the year 2015. Each of these subsets contains 200 tweets. Note that the test tweets are independent from the training tweets that were collected in the year 2014. One professor and five graduate students annotated the tweets, with each tweet annotated by three people. The instructions for annotators are shown in the ''Appendix''. Annotators were asked to assign a value of 1 if they considered a tweet to be Personal, and a value of 0 if they considered it to be News, according to the instructions they were given. If a tweet was labeled as a Personal tweet by an annotator, s/he was asked to further label it as Personal Negative or Personal Non-Negative tweet. We utilized Fleiss' Kappa (Fleiss 1971) to measure the inter-rater agreement between the three annotators of each tweet. Table 6 presents the agreement between human annotators. For each tweet, if at least two out of three annotators agreed on a Label (Personal Negative, Personal Non-Negative, or News), we labeled the tweet with this sentiment.

As pointed out by Bruns and Stieglitz (2014) , there are two questions to be addressed in terms of generalizing collected Twitter data. (1) Does Twitter data represent Twitter? (2) Does Twitter represent society? To answer the first question, according to the documentation (Twitter 2014b) , the Twitter Streaming API returns at most 1 % of all the tweets produced on Twitter at any given time. Once the number of tweets matching given parameters (keywords, geographical boundary, user ID) is beyond the 1 % of all the tweets, Twitter will begin to sample the data that it returns to the user. To mitigate this, we utilized highly specific keywords (e.g., h1n1, h5n1) for each tweet type (e.g., flu) to increase the coverage of collected data (Morstatter et al. 2013) . These keywords are shown in ''Appendix'' Section. As for the second question, Mislove et al. (2011) has found that the Twitter users significantly over-represent the densely populated regions of the USA, are predominantly male, and represent a highly non-random sample of the race/ethnicity distribution.

This result illustrates the complexity of the sentiment classification task, since even humans exhibit relatively low agreement on the labels of tweets.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 378, "text": "Landis and Koch (1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prototype system"}, {"text": "Experimental results show that (1) in sentiment classification, by combining a clue-based method with a Machine Learning method, our two-step algorithm is able to classify a tweet as Personal Negative, Personal Non-Negative, or News tweet with good accuracy.

Negation and irony in tweets. In logic, negation is an operation that transforms a proposition p into another proposition ''not p''. Wiegand et al. (2010) presented a survey on the role of negation in sentiment analysis and investigated several negation models. In our sentiment classification approach, we utilized profanity words to automatically annotate Negative tweets with the assumption that profanity words indicate a negative emotion. However, this assumption may not hold in a negative context. Kiritchenko et al. (2014) showed that in a negative context, both positive and negative terms tend to convey a negative sentiment (e.g., ''I know what it feels like to make a thousand dollars in one day, thanks to my tax returns. I'm still not satisfied'').", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 157, "text": "Wiegand et al. (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 508, "end": 533, "text": "Kiritchenko et al. (2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prototype system"}, {"text": "We also observe that profanity words sometimes reverse their polarity when used to modify a positive term (e.g., ''damn'' is a positive term in ''Marriage feels pretty damn great!''). To further improve our two-step sentiment classification, we plan to utilize the negated and affirmative context lexicons (Kiritchenko et al. 2014 ) to give different polarities and sentiment scores to a word depending on whether it appears in a negated context or in an affirmative context. 2. Irony is another difficult problem, since an ironic statement is used to express the opposite of what is being said (Quintilien and Butler 1953) . Utsumi (1996) proposed one of the first computational theories to formalize an ironic environment but the model is too abstract to represent a non-hearer-listener interaction (Reyes et al. 2013 ). In addition, irony detection requires knowledge of cultural and social stereotypes and tends to be subjective and personal. For the sentiment classification task, the appearance of irony often indicates the opposite of the literal meaning of a statement. Recently, a few techniques were proposed to detect irony in tweets, by investigating irony features. Reyes et al. (2013) proposed four types of conceptual features, which include signatures, unexpectedness, style, and emotional scenarios. More recently, Barbieri and Saggion (2014) designed another set of features that take into account the sentiments. We plan to investigate these features to better reveal the real sentiments underneath the literal ones to further improve the accuracy of sentiment classification. 3. Measure of Concern is currently based on the number of Personal Negative tweets and total number of tweets on the same day. The MOC was used to define the fraction of tweets that are Personal Negative tweets. We plan to fine grain this definition to quantify the number of tweets expressing real concern. Previous research has been done to classify fine-grained emotions. Brynielsson et al. (2014) manually labeled angry, fear, and positive tweets and trained classifiers with the labeled data to predict which emotion category each tweet belongs to. In the future, we will extend the current work using a more specific sentiment lexicon, such as LIWC (Pennebaker and Francis 1999) , to automatically label the tweets that express concerns. In this way, the classifier will be better able to directly identify the tweets with concerns. 4. To improve the performance of classification, we plan to extend the current feature set to include more features specific to micro-blogs, such as slang terms and intensifiers to capture the unique language in micro-blogs. Slang replacement (Piskorski et al. 2013) is able to reveal the semantics and sentiment by translating the slang terms into their original meaning. For example, ''ugh'' is translated into ''disgusted''. As reported by Kouloumpis et al. (2011) , the presence of intensifiers, such as all caps and character repetitions in micro-blogs, is also a useful feature for sentiment classification. In Personal vs. News classification, we chose to work in the Machine Learning-based paradigm. However, we note that some lightweight knowledge-based approaches could possibly produce competitive results. For example, if the tweet is of the form ''TEXT URL'' and the TEXT appears on the web page that the URL points to, the tweet is a News Tweet. The intuition behind this approach is that the title of a news article is often pasted into the tweet body followed by the URL to that news article. We would like to perform a comparison of these knowledge-based approaches with our ML approach in the future. 5. Although it is difficult to find the ground truth for sentiment trends, we would like to conduct a systematic experiment on comparing the sentiments derived by our methods with the epidemic cases reported by other available tools, and with authoritative data sources, such as Health Map and CDC reports. The sentiment trends for topics will also be studied by combining the sentiment analysis algorithms with topic modeling algorithms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 330, "text": "(Kiritchenko et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 595, "end": 623, "text": "(Quintilien and Butler 1953)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 626, "end": 639, "text": "Utsumi (1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 801, "end": 819, "text": "(Reyes et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1198, "text": "Reyes et al.
