            "text": "As antimicrobial signalling molecules, type III or lambda interferons (IFN\u03bbs) are critical for defence against infection by diverse pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. Counter-intuitively, expression of one member of the family, IFN\u03bb4, is associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the human population; by contrast, a natural frameshift mutation that abrogates IFN\u03bb4 production improves HCV clearance. To further understand how genetic variation between and within species affects IFN\u03bb4 function, we screened a panel of all known extant coding variants of human IFN\u03bb4 for their antiviral potential and identify three that substantially affect activity: P70S, L79F and K154E. The most notable variant was K154E, which was found in African Congo rainforest 'Pygmy' hunter-gatherers. K154E greatly enhanced in vitro activity in a range of antiviral (HCV, Zika virus, influenza virus and encephalomyocarditis virus) and gene expression assays. Remarkably, E154 is the ancestral residue in mammalian IFN\u03bb4s and is extremely well conserved, yet K154 has been fixed throughout evolution of the hominid genus Homo, including Neanderthals. Compared to chimpanzee IFN\u03bb4, the human orthologue had reduced activity due to amino acid K154. Comparison of published gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees showed that this difference in activity between K154 and E154 in IFN\u03bb4 correlates with differences in antiviral gene expression in vivo during HCV infection. Mechanistically, our data show that the human-specific K154 negatively affects IFN\u03bb4 activity through a novel means by reducing its secretion and potency. We thus demonstrate that attenuated activity of IFN\u03bb4 is conserved among humans and postulate that differences in IFN\u03bb4 activity between species contribute to distinct host-specific responses to-and outcomes ofinfection, such as HCV infection. The driver of reduced IFN\u03bb4 antiviral activity in humans remains unknown but likely arose between 6 million and 360,000 years ago in Africa.",

IFNs bind to cell surface receptors, commencing autocrine and paracrine signalling via the 'JAK-STAT' pathway. Through this mechanism, IFNs induce expression of hundreds of 'interferon-stimulated genes' (ISGs) that establish a cell-intrinsic 'antiviral state' and regulate cellular immunity and inflammation [2, 3] . Thus, IFNs are pleiotropic in activity and modulate aspects of protective immunity and pathogenesis [4] .",

Emerging evidence highlights the critical and non-redundant role that IFN\u03bbs play in protecting against diverse pathogens, including viruses, such as norovirus [7] , influenza virus [8] and flaviviruses [9] ; bacteria [10] ; and fungi [11] . While IFN\u03bbs induce nearly identical genes to type I IFNs, differences in signalling kinetics and cell-type specificity contribute to their specialisation [12, 13] . Hence, as a consequence of selective expression of the IFN\u03bb receptor 1 (IFN\u03bbR1) co-receptor on epithelial cells [13] , type III IFNs play a significant role in defence of 'barrier tissues', such as the gut, respiratory tract and liver [reviewed in 14] ; the second co-receptor for IFN\u03bb is IL10-R2, which is expressed more broadly.",

            "text": "Although important for host defence, some IFNs are highly polymorphic [15] . In humans, a number of genetic variants in the type III IFN locus (containing IFN\u03bbs 1-4) have been identified and are associated with clinical phenotypes relating to viral infection [16] [17] [18] . Although many of these variants are in linkage disequilibrium, the major functional variant is thought to lie in the IFNL4 gene [19] . This causative variant is a single substitution/insertion mutation converting the '\u0394G' allele to a 'TT' allele (rs368234815), thereby yielding a frameshift which leads to loss of active human IFN\u03bb4 (HsIFN\u03bb4) [18] . Genome-wide association studies have convincingly demonstrated a seemingly counter-intuitive correlation between the IFNL4 \u0394G allele and reduced clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, i.e individuals who produce HsIFN\u03bb4 clear HCV infection with reduced frequency in the presence or absence of antiviral IFN therapy [17, 18] . Although IFN\u03bb4 is highly conserved among mammals, the 'pseudogenising' TT allele of HsIFN\u03bb4 has evolved under positive selection in some human populations suggesting that expression of the wild-type protein likely conferred a fitness cost during recent human evolution [20] . Expression of IFN\u03bb4 is tightly controlled and reduced in human as well as Gorilla cells following viral infection compared to IFN\u03bb3 [21] . The mechanism underlying the contribution of HsIFN\u03bb4 to viral persistence in HCV infection is not well understood but is associated with enhanced ISG induction. Moreover, a common natural variant of HsIFN\u03bb4 (P70S) [18] , which has reduced signalling capacity, is also linked with improved HCV clearance [22] . Thus, there is a spectrum of HsIFN\u03bb4 activity in humans as a consequence of natural variation that has a significant influence on chronic HCV infection, with wt HsIFN\u03bb4 representing the protein with apparently the greatest antiviral activity.",

In this study, we have examined human genetic data to identify other possible naturally occurring IFN\u03bb4 variants and performed comparative analysis with mammalian orthologues in species closely related to humans. We provide evidence that the antiviral potential for the most common form of IFN\u03bb4 in humans has attenuated activity due to a single amino acid substitution. In addition, we propose that acquisition of the attenuating substitution arose very early during human evolution but that some populations do encode a more active variant. Mechanistically, our data show that the reduced antiviral potential of human IFN\u03bb4 results from a likely dual defect in secretion and potency.",

Transient transfection of the expression plasmids into human 'producer' cells (HEK-293T cells) allowed harvesting of active HsIFN\u03bb4 in the cell supernatant (referred to herein as conditioned media [CM] ) thereby enabling analysis of the effects of variants on HsIFN\u03bb4 production, glycosylation, secretion and potency; a similar approach has been successfully adopted previously to determine the relative activities of secreted HsIFN\u03bb3 and HsIFN\u03bb4 as well as a HsIFN\u03bb4 variant that is not glycosylated [24] .

We also measured their capacity to induce two major ISGs, MX1 and ISG15, by RT-qPCR (Fig 1D and 1E and S2B and S2C Fig) and validated the ISG15 mRNA data by determining production of unconjugated 'mono' ISG15 and high-molecular weight ISG15-conjugates (' ISGylation'; S2D Fig) . In addition, we constructed a series of negative controls (plasmids expressing EGFP and the frameshift TT variant of HsIFN\u03bb4), a positive control (HsIFN\u03bb3op) for comparative analysis to examine HsIFN\u03bb4 activity, and three HsIFN\u03bb4 variants, which do not occur naturally but were included as they could alter post-translational modification (N61A which ablates glycosylation) or potential receptor interactions (F159A and L162A located in helix F), respectively [27] . Negative controls (EGFP or the frameshift TT variant) gave very low induction of ISG15 and MX1 and no detectable antiviral activity in the EMCV assay whereas the positive control (HsIFN\u03bb3op) was highly active in both assays (S2A-S2C Fig) . The non-natural variants N61A and F159A almost abolished activity compared to wt HsIFN\u03bb4 and HsIFN\u03bb3op while L162A gave slightly less activity in the ISG induction assay but activity was reduced to a greater extent in the EMCV assay. In a previous report, ablating glycosylation at N61 substantially reduced activity of secreted HsIFN\u03bb4 in an ISG induction assay [24] . Thus, our assay systems recapitulated findings from previous studies with similar assays and provided a range of activities to assess the impact of the natural HsIFN\u03bb4 variants.",

            "text": "Examining the global distribution of genetic variation can help understand its origins, evolution and functional consequences. P70S is a common variant that is found worldwide (in every population in the 1000 Genomes Database). By contrast, L79F and K154E are rare and, based on evidence in the 1000 Genomes Project Database, geographically restricted to West Africa/Americas, and central Africa, respectively (Fig 1A) . We were able to obtain DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines developed from the 2 individuals encoding the L79F variant; our analysis revealed that the West African subject carried the SNP for this variant but not the individual from the Americas see Materials and Methods).). Thus, we could verify the occurrence of the L79F variant in Africa but not in the Americas. From further interrogation of the 1000 Genomes Database [28] , the HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E variant was present in two individuals from different African rainforest 'Pygmy' hunter-gatherer populations (Baka and Bakola) in Cameroon (S4A Fig). The Bakola individual was homozygous for the \u0394G allele, indicating that the K154E variant would be encoded on one of the functional \u0394G HsIFN\u03bb4 alleles. The Baka subject was heterozygous at rs368234815 (\u0394G/TT) and thus only one allele (\u0394G) would produce full-length HsIFN\u03bb4, presumably K154E. The other allele (TT) is a pseudogene and would not lead to expression of functional HsIFN\u03bb4. Each of the Baka and Bakola individuals also had additional non-synonymous HsIFN\u03bb4 variants (V158I and R151P, Baka and Bakola individuals respectively); these variants were included in our functional screen of HsIFN\u03bb4 variants but did not significantly alter activity (Fig 1C-1E and S2A-S2C Fig) . From analysis of the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [29] , the SNP variant resulting in the K154E substitution was found in a further 29 out of a population of 8,655 African individuals. Thus, this SNP is rare in the African population (0.003%) compared to the combined Baka/Bakola groups (20%). K154E was not found in other East or Southern African hunter-gatherer populations (such as Hadza and Sandawe) nor in the African San, who have the oldest genetic lineages among humans [30] (S4B Fig); it was also not identified in Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages (denoted as 'archaic' in S4B Fig) . However, E154 is encoded in the IFN\u03bb4 orthologue for the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes (Pt), our closest mammalian species. Notably, the human TT allele encodes a potential K154 codon [18] suggesting that the E154K substitution arose in humans prior to IFNL4 pseudogenisation. Together with the fact that nearly all humans encode K154, these data suggest that the less active E154K substitution emerged early during human evolution after the divergence of our last common ancestor with chimpanzees.",

            "text": "Since a lysine residue encoded at positon 154 is unique to humans compared to other mammalian species (Fig 2A) [31] , we compared wt HsIFN\u03bb4 and its K154E variant to wt PtIFN\u03bb4 and an equivalent 'humanised' PtIFN\u03bb4 E154K mutant in both the EMCV and ISG induction assays as well as a CRISPR-Cas9 cell line in which the EGFP coding region had been introduced into the endogenous Although intracellular expression levels of each IFN\u03bb4 variant were similar, (Fig 2B) , wt PtIFN\u03bb4 was significantly more active than HsIFN\u03bb4 in each assay and had approximately equivalent activity to the HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E variant in signalling as well as antiviral assays (Fig  2C-2E) . Converting PtIFN\u03bb4 to encode the E154K variant significantly decreased activity to levels that were similar to those for wt HsIFN\u03bb4 (encoding lysine at position 154). Extending the analysis to include rhesus macaque IFN\u03bb4 (Macaca mulatta, MmIFN\u03bb4) gave the same pattern whereby wt MmIFN\u03bb4 with E154 had greater activity than its K154 variant. However, wt MmIFN\u03bb4 was less active than either the human or chimpanzee IFN\u03bb4 with E154 indicating that other genetic differences likely modified MmIFN\u03bb4 activity in our assays. Consistent with the hypothesis that additional genetic differences affect susceptibility to E154K, introducing a lysine into the equivalent position of HsIFN\u03bb3 had a much lesser effect on its activity compared to IFN\u03bb4 (Fig 2C-2E) . Overall, we observed a similar~100-fold enhancement of activity for E154 over K154 for each of the IFN\u03bb4 orthologues in anti-EMCV activity and EGFP IFN reporter induction. Thus, we conclude that wt HsIFN\u03bb4 has attenuated activity principally because of a single amino acid change at position 154.",

            "text": "To broaden analysis of the impact of a lysine residue compared to a glutamic acid at position 154 in HsIFN\u03bb4, antiviral assays were conducted with other human viruses that are less sensitive to exogenous IFN compared to EMCV, and on different cell lines. Specifically, we used HCV infection in Huh7 cells as well as infectious assays with influenza A virus (IAV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in A549 cells against single high dilutions of each IFN. As controls, we also included the less active P70S and L79F HsIFN\u03bb4 variants alongside HsIFN\u03bb3op in these assays. Using the HCVcc infectious system in Huh7 cells, HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E significantly decreased both viral RNA abundance compared to wt protein and exhibited a trend towards a lower number of infected viral antigen (NS5A)-positive cells (Fig 3A, upper and lower panels respectively). Furthermore, we performed assays examining HCV entry (HCV pseudoparticle system [HCVpp]), viral RNA translation and RNA replication (both assessed with the HCV sub-genomic replicon system). There was no significant difference in the efficiency of HCVpp infection between wt HsIFN\u03bb4 and any of the three variants tested in the MLV-based pseudoparticle assay (Fig 3B, upper panel) . However, we did observe a greater inhibition when the non-HCV E1E2-containing PPs were used, potentially reflecting the higher efficiency or different mode of entry of HCVpp entry compared to non-glycoprotein-containing retroviral PPs that could saturate an inhibitory response (Fig 3B, lower panel) . wt HsIFN\u03bb4 reduced HCV RNA replication compared to EGFP and introducing the K154E mutation into wt HsIFN\u03bb4 gave a further significant reduction in replication. (Fig 3C, upper panel) . However, primary translation of input viral RNA was not affected by HsIFN\u03bb addition (Fig 3C, lower panel) . To examine further the inhibitory effect of wt HsIFN\u03bb4 and the K154E variant on viral RNA replication, Huh7 cells that constitutively expressed a HCV sub-genomic replicon [Tri-JFH1; 32] were treated with both forms of the protein over several passages (S6A Fig). Our results revealed a consistent decrease in HCV RNA levels over 8 passages spanning 25 days with the K154E variant exerting a greater inhibition on RNA replication compared to wt HsIFN\u03bb4; consistent with this conclusion, fewer sub-genomic replicon-bearing cells survived treatment with HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E than the wt protein (S6B and S6C Fig) . Thus, HsIFN\u03bb4 reduces HCV RNA replication and the K154E variant exerts greater potency against this stage in the virus life cycle. HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E also reduced titers of IAV and ZIKV to a greater extent than wt protein in A549 cells (~10-fold; Fig 3D and 3E) . Although this was only statistically significant in the context of IAV, a similar trend was evident with ZIKV for the K154E variant compared to wt HsIFN\u03bb4. We found that the P70S and L79F variants consistently reduced the ability of wt HsIFN\u03bb4 to protect against infection in most assays. Taken together, our data further confirmed the greater antiviral activity associated with converting a lysine residue at position 154 in HsIFN\u03bb4 to a glutamic acid residue.",

Many of the differentially-expressed genes shared by HsIFN\u03bb4 wt, K154E and P70S included known restriction factors with antiviral activity (e.g. IFI27, MX1, ISG15; Fig 4E) although the magnitude of induction was consistently greatest for HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E (Fig 4F) . There were also several ISGs that only achieved significant induction by K154E and HsIFN\u03bb3op (e.g. IDO1, IRF1 and ISG20; Fig 4E and 4F) . We predict that the apparent selectivity by IFN\u03bb4 K154E results from the greater potency of this variant compared to wt. HsIFN\u03bb4 and the P70S variant allowing genes to reach the significance threshold (Fig 4F) . Enhanced production of antiviral genes in cells treated with HsIFN\u03bb4 E154 would explain differences in antiviral activity against EMCV, HCV, IAV and ZIKV.",

This was not possible since such tissue samples are not available from the Pygmy population infected with HCV and biopsies from acutely infected individuals are exceptionally rare. Moreover, chimpanzees are no longer used for experimental studies for ethical reasons. Therefore, we compared lists of reported differentially-expressed genes during acute HCV infection in humans and chimpanzees from the available literature. In the case of humans, there is only one report that analyses the transcriptional response in acute infection [33] . For chimpanzees, gene expression analysis is available from four independent studies [34] [35] [36] [37] which include longitudinal data from serial biopsies. Therefore, all of the data was collated and we focused our comparisons on periods when human and chimpanzee biopsies were taken across the same time period after initial HCV infection (between 8 and 20 weeks post infection).",

In chimpanzees, the transcriptional profile contained significantly expressed genes that were type I/III IFN-regulated ISGs known to restrict HCV infection (RSAD2, IFI27 and IFIT1) [2] , as well as genes involved in antigen presentation and adaptive immunity (HLA-DMA and PSMA6). These genes were not significantly differentially expressed in humans, whose response was mainly directed towards up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes (for example, CXCL10, CCL18 and CCL5) and metabolism genes (AKR1B10 and HKDC1) (Fig 5A and Data). This was consistent with previous characterisation of the human acute response to HCV infection that failed to detect a major type I/III IFN signature but predominantly found a type II or IFN-gamma-mediated response [33] . From the available longitudinal data, the 'chimpanzee-biased' differentially-expressed genes were induced early in infection and remained significantly up-regulated during the acute phase following an early peak after infection (S7A and S7B Fig) . Differences were also reflected in pathway analysis in terms of the most significant pathways and their overall levels of significance (S3 Data). For example, the 'chemokine-mediated signalling pathway' was upregulated in humans but not chimpanzees whereas the T cell receptor signalling pathway which was modulated in chimpanzees was not significantly altered in humans. Inspection of the raw data from humans indicated that many Numbers of shared and unique differentiallyexpressed genes in liver biopsies from HCV-infected humans (blue) and experimentally-infected chimpanzees (orange) during the acute phase of infection represented as a Venn diagram (also see S1 Data). Gene expression during a time period of between 8 and 20 weeks was used where comparable published data for both species exists. The top ten species-'specific', differentially-expressed genes are shown ranked by levels of expression. Two sets of values for each comparison are shown; above shows the total differentially-expressed genes from at least one study while \u00c3 highlights the value relating to the 'core' chimpanzee analysis that considered only the genes differentially-expressed in at least two studies of chimpanzee acute HCV infection.

The chimpanzee values represent an average of all fold changes for each chimpanzee over the time period.

No crystal structure for HsIFN\u03bb4 is available but a homology model based on comparison with the IFN\u03bb3 structure has been reported [24] . We expanded this predicted model based on both of the IFN\u03bb1 and IFN\u03bb3 crystal structures to explore the possible impact of K154E, P70S and L79F on IFN\u03bb4 function (Fig 6A and S8 Fig; [38, 39] ). As has been previously described, the sequences in helix F, which binds to IFN\u03bbR1, are relatively well conserved [18, 24] . The position equivalent to amino acid 154 in IFN\u03bb4 is a glutamic acid in both IFN\u03bb1 and IFN\u03bb3 (amino acid position 176 in IFN\u03bb1 and 171 in IFN\u03bb3) and its side chain faces inward towards the opposing IL10R2-binding helices C and D (Fig 6A) . The free carboxyl group of glutamic acid forms non-covalent intramolecular interactions with two non-linear segments on IFN\u03bb1 and 3 (IFN\u03bb1 residue K64, and in IFN\u03bb3 K67 and T108). In IFN\u03bb4, these E154-interacting positions are not conserved compared to IFN\u03bb1/3 although homologous positions do exist with biochemically similar residues (IFN\u03bb4 R60, and R98 that lies just upstream of the residue homologous to IFN\u03bb3 T108).",

Firstly, intracellular expression of each variant at position 154 was approximately equivalent (Fig 6B) . In signalling assays, the order of activity was E>Q/D>A>L>K>R (S9A Fig). We found a similar pattern in the EMCV antiviral assays except that L154 had the least activity (Fig 6C) . We interpret these findings to conclude that E154 is biochemically the most favoured residue at this position with regards to antiviral potential, and that substitution of E154 to lysine results in the lowest potency for IFN\u03bb4 activity. Interestingly, both Q154 and D154 had 'intermediate' activity compared to E154 and K154, suggesting that side chain length and negative charge are important to maximise the activity of IFN\u03bb4.",

As wt HsIFN\u03bb4 is poorly secreted into the supernatant from transfected cells in the absence of enrichment [24, 40] , IFN\u03bb4 in CM was immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody. In . The IFN\u03bb4 variants were detected with an anti-FLAG antibody. A FLAG-positive lower molecular weight product, which is potentially a degradation product is highlighted with a #. An upper band running near to the IFN is shown ( \u00c3 ) which is likely antibody fragments from the immunoprecipitation reaction. Blot is representative of three independent experiments. (F) Schematic of the split NanoLuc Luciferase assay to measure antiviral assays, the activity of human, chimpanzee and macaque E154 variants from cell supernatants, IP fractions and lysates was greater than the corresponding K154 variants in agreement with our earlier results (Fig 6D and Fig 2C-2E) . Moreover, the D154 and R154 variants yielded patterns for cell lysates, cell supernatants and immunoprecipitated IFN\u03bb4 protein such that D154 had intermediate activity between E154 and K154 while R154 had approximately equivalent activity to K154 (S9B Fig). Thus, each variant displayed a similar pattern of activity irrespective of the source of IFN\u03bb4. From Western blot analysis, the E154 and K154 variants for each individual species were detected at similar levels in cell lysates (S9C Fig). The HsIFN\u03bb4 D154 and R154 variants were expressed to slightly higher and lower levels respectively compared to E154 and K154 from humans. Paradoxically, we did not find the same pattern in IFN\u03bb4 abundance for immunoprecipitated protein derived from cell supernatants. Thus, we were able to detect greater amounts of the E154 variants for human, chimpanzee and macaque IFN\u03bb4 compared to their K154 variants (Fig 6E and S9D Fig) . It was not possible to reliably detect macaque K154 or human R154 variants. HsIFN\u03bb4 D154 had levels intermediate between the E154 and K154 variants. By Western blot and subsequent densitometry analysis, the relative abundance of IFN\u03bb4 E154 and K154 variants in cell lysates for any species differed by 1.3 fold yet the approximate fold increase in antiviral activities were significantly greater and on average 16-fold. For the secreted IFN\u03bb4 variants, we found that not only was there a higher abundance of E154 to K154 protein (9-fold), but activity was 41-fold higher for E154 than K154 variants, which results in a significant 3 to 4-fold rise in antiviral activity not explained by protein abundance (S9E Fig). With the exception of macaque K154, the FLAG antibody detected a putative breakdown product of about 11kDa in each of the samples, which we presume arose from cleavage by an unknown intracellular protease as it was also detected in cell lysates. The amount of this lower molecular weight product followed the same pattern as the full-length protein in that there was more with E154 than K154 thus cleavage does not explain differences in antiviral activity.",

The advantage of this approach was that the relative secretion of each variant could be determined by comparing enzyme activity from cell lysates and culture media in a highly-quantitative manner. Moreover, the antiviral activity of HiBiT-tagged HsIFN\u03bb4 variants could be compared to their respective FLAG-tagged versions. To demonstrate the capacity of the system to quantify secretion, we generated HiBiT-tagged versions of wt HsIFN\u03bb3 and HsIFN\u03bb4 with and without Nterminal signal sequences, which would abrogate secretion. Removing the signal sequences from either HsIFN\u03bb protein reduced secretion by fivefold (Fig 6F and 6G) . The non-natural N61A variant that is not glycosylated was secreted~2-fold less efficiently than wt HsIFN\u03bb4. In agreement with our data using FLAG-tagged HsIFN\u03bb4, the K154E variant of HsIFN\u03bb4 was secreted about 3 times more efficiently than the wt protein (Fig 6F and 6G) . In a subsequent screen of all HsIFN\u03bb4 natural variants with the HiBiT tag system, we also validated the data shown in Fig 1C and S2 Fig (S10A-S10C Fig). Moreover, HiBiT-tagged HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E was >10-fold more active than the wt form (S11C Fig). Thus, both FLAG-and HiBiT-tagged the relative abundance of intra-and extracellular abundance of HsIFN\u03bb3 and HsIFN\u03bb4 variants produced in plasmid-transfected cells.

Treatment with these inhibitors disrupted secretion of HsIFN\u03bb3 by 12-(BFA) and 25-fold (Monensin). For the HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E variant, each of the inhibitors blocked secretion by about 10-12-fold. In the case of wt HsIFN\u03bb4, BFA inhibited secretion to a greater extent (~20-fold) than for either HsIFN\u03bb3 or HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E whereas Monensin decreased secretion to a similar extent for all three proteins. The explanation for the slightly greater inhibition of HsIFN\u03bb4 by BFA requires further investigation. Overall, our data conclusively demonstrate that glutamic acid at position 154 promotes greater antiviral potential by enhancing both IFN\u03bb4 secretion from cells and its intrinsic potency.",

By comparing IFN\u03bb4 from different species we demonstrate that the genus Homo evolved an IFN\u03bb4 gene with attenuated activity (prior to the TT allele), and that the vast majority of extant humans carry an IFN\u03bb4 variant with lower antiviral potential due to a mutation of a single highly-conserved amino acid residue (E154K). Human African hunter-gatherer Pygmies and chimpanzees encode a more active IFN\u03bb4 (E154).

Subsequently, the IFNL4 gene acquired two further variants, the P70S and TT alleles that are now common in the human population [18] . Acquisition of each of these alleles either further reduced (P70S) or abolished (TT) IFN\u03bb4 activity. Other rare variants have arisen in humans with little impact on HsIFN\u03bb4 antiviral potential based on our in vitro assays, except for variants L79F and K154E, which lower and increase activity respectively. To us, the most intriguing of these variants is K154E, which was found in a high proportion of rainforest 'Pygmy' hunter-gatherers from west central Africa [28] but was rarely present in the African population. Since this variant was not present in the genetic data for San and Archaic Neanderthal and Denisovan human lineages, we speculate that these populations likely reacquired K154E following divergence of chimpanzees and humans. However, with the ever-increasing availability of genetic data from ancient and extant human populations, it may be possible to identify other populations carrying the E154 variant; in particular more details on the demographics of the 29 African individuals in the gnomAD database [29] may address whether there are additional specific groups who carry this more active variant and how it arose.",

It has been demonstrated that loss of IFNL4 has evolved under positive selection in some human populations thus we speculate that differences in exposure to certain pathogenic microbes has driven evolution of the E154 variant. On the one hand, type III IFN signalling enhances disease and impedes bacterial clearance in mouse models of bacterial pneumonia [44] . This suggests that IFN\u03bb4 with a lower activity could be beneficial during non-viral infections although a link between IFNL4 genotype and bacterial infection in humans has not yet been made. Conversely, we postulate that the presence of more active IFN\u03bb4 exemplified by E154 in Pygmies and chimpanzees may be linked to increased exposure to zoonotic viral infections in the Congo rainforest, such as pathogenic Filovirus infections [45] .",

For example, chimpanzees have been reported to clear HCV infection more efficiently than humans [47] , rarely develop hepatic diseases similar to humans [48] , and are refractory to IFN\u03b1 therapy [49] . Moreover, HCV evolves more slowly in infected chimpanzees, possibly due to a stronger immune pressure that reduces replication compared to humans [50] . In humans, IFNL4 genetic variants are associated with, and thought to regulate, each of these characteristics [18, 51, 52] . Although myriad factors could explain these phenotypic differences, including differences in antagonism of the immune response by HCV or changes in IFNL transcription for example, we propose that the greater antiviral activity of PtIFN\u03bb4 compared to HsIFN\u03bb4 contributes to the distinct responses to HCV infection in the two species.",

Differences in IFN signalling during HCV infection have been postulated to explain the ability to control HCV infection in cell culture or following IFN-based therapy in humans [55, 56] . Our comparative meta-analysis of the available literature revealed an apparent enhanced expression of ISGs with anti-HCV activity as well as genes involved in antigen presentation and T cell mediated immunity in chimpanzees compared to humans. Our analysis cannot be considered conclusive given the disparate nature of the retrospective studies used in our comparisons and therefore, there are a number of caveats (e.g. the expression levels of the IFNL genes; the relative expression of receptors in the two species). Nonetheless, we speculate that enhanced expression of ISGs in chimpanzee liver due to higher IFN\u03bb4 activity could lead to greater control of viral infection by both inducing antiviral genes and by coordinating a more effective adaptive T cell response, which is critical for clearance and pathogenesis during HCV infection [57] .",

A recent study in Pygmies from Cameroon, including the Baka and Bakola groups, showed low seroprevalence of 0.6% and no evidence of chronic HCV infection [58] . Interestingly, infection in non-Pygmy groups in Cameroon has a seroprevalence of~17% [59] . One explanation for this difference could be higher IFN\u03bb4 activity in populations with the K154E variant, which may enhance HCV clearance.",

            "text": "Our observed functional differences between E154 and K154 did not correlate with levels of intracellular accumulation or glycosylation. However, we did find that the more active E154 variants for human, chimpanzee and macaque IFN\u03bb4 were detected at higher levels in the immunoprecipitated fractions from cell supernatant (CM) compared to the K154 variants; the D154 and R154 variants also were detected at a lower level than E154. Interestingly, endogenous, wt HsIFN\u03bb4 with K154 is not secreted to detectable levels compared to wt HsIFN\u03bb3 [24, 40, 60] . Detection of low levels of secreted wt HsIFN\u03bb4 by Western blot analysis requires exogenous expression of the protein and precipitation of material in the cell supernatant. Poor release of HsIFN\u03bb4 was not due to differences in the signal peptide of HsIFN\u03bb4 or HsIFN\u03bb3 but secretion could be ablated if the single N-linked glycosylation site was mutated [24] . Our data indicate that position 154 regulates release of intracellular IFN\u03bb4. Moreover, IFN\u03bb4s with E154 are more potent than those with K154 when correcting for the difference in amounts of protein. This increase in potency for E154 was detected in both IP protein and lysates as well as HsIFN\u03bb4 with different C-terminal tags. Moreover, we observed that the difference between E and K is greater in the cell released fraction than the cell lysate. The reason for this discrepancy could be explained by a number of factors that are outside of the scope of this study. Based on our modelling of the IFN\u03bb4 structure and further mutational analysis, glutamic acid is apparently the optimal residue at position 154.",

Notably, replacing glutamic acid with either aspartic acid or glutamine gave higher IFN\u03bb4 activity than either non-polar or positivelycharged residues. These potential E154-mediated interactions occur in the region of the protein devoid of cysteine-bonds likely making the interaction between helix F (IFN\u03bbR1-binding) and the loop connecting helices C and D (IL-10-R2-binding) particularly flexible. The putative greater structural stability facilitated by E154 may inherently increase the structural integrity of IFN\u03bb4 making this variant more competent for secretion and more potent in signalling through the IFN\u03bbR1-IL10R2 surface receptor complex. Increased binding to IFN receptor complexes has been shown to enhance signalling by type I IFNs [61, 62] . Further biophysical studies using highly-purified recombinant protein measuring affinity and avidity of HsIFN\u03bb4 wt and K154E for each receptor molecule [as in 27, 39] combined with studies on the mechanism of IFN\u03bb4 release will help address these hypotheses.",

The reference sequence for the human genome contains the frameshift 'TT' allele and so potential effects of variants on the HsIFN\u03bb4 predicted amino acid sequence were identified manually following correction for the frameshift mutation (TT to \u0394G). The effect of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the open reading frame (ORF) was thus assessed and re-annotated as synonymous or non-synonymous changes resulting in the selection of coding variants reported here. Inspection of whole genome sequence data from African hunter-gatherers was carried out using previously published datasets [28] . We remapped the raw reads of six San individuals (four Ju|'hoan and two \u2021Khomani San) in the Simons Genomic Diversity Project [30] to the human reference genome (hg19) and conducted variant calling using the haplotype caller module in GATK (v3). Two Ju|'hoan individuals were heterozygous at rs368234815 (TT/\u0394G genotype, S2 Data). To validate the L79F variant, genomic DNA isolated from Epstein-Barr virus-immortalised B-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines from individuals (HG03095 and NA19658) identified through the 1000 Genomes Project and International HAPMAP project as probands with the L79F substitution (rs564293856 G>A SNP) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. PCR was used to generate an amplicon of~300 base pairs corresponding to the region that includes rs564293856; amplicons were column-purified (Qiagen PCR-Clean Up kit, Qiagen). Internal forward and reverse primers within the amplicon were employed to determine the sequence of the region across SNP rs564293856 by Sanger sequencing (S13A and S13B Fig) . The resulting chromatograms were inspected manually and the sequences at rs564293856 were called when identified using primers from both directions. HG03095 was confirmed as heterozygous for rs564293856 as predicted although we failed to detect the variant in NA19658; HG03095 and NA19658 were individuals who originated from Africa and America respectively.",

Sample RNA concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and RNA integrity (RIN) was determined using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation. All samples had a RIN value of 9 or above. 1.5 \u03bcg of total RNA from each sample was prepared for sequencing using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, polyadenylated RNA molecules were captured, followed by fragmentation. RNA fragments were reverse transcribed and converted to dsDNA, end-repaired, A-tailed, ligated to indexed adaptors and amplified by PCR. Libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations and sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer using a high output cartridge, generating approximately 25 million reads per sample, with a read length of 75 bp. 96.3% of the reads had a Q score of 30 or above. Data was de-multiplexed and fastq files were generated on a biolinux server using bcl2fastq version v2.16. RNA-Seq analysis was performed using the Tuxedo protocol [63] . Briefly, reads from 3 replicates per condition were aligned and junctions mapped against the human reference transcriptome hg38 using Tophat2 with the default settings except library type. Transcriptome assembly was performed using Cufflinks supplying annotations from the reference genome hg38 and the differential gene expression was calculated using Cuffdiff. Differential gene expression was considered significant when the observed fold change was !2.0 and FDR/q-value was <0.05 between comparisons.

            "text": "An IFN reporter HepaRG cell line was generated to measure IFN activity by introducing the EGFP ORF fused to the ISG15 ORF separated by ribosome skipping sites by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. We chose to introduce EGFP in-frame to the N-terminus of the ISG15 ORF since it is a robustly-induced ISG. We also introduced the blasticidin resistance gene (BSD) for selection purposes. BSD, EGFP and ISG15 were separated using ribosome skipping 2A sequences (P2A and T2A). Transgene DNA was flanked by homology arms with reference to the predicted target site. Homology donor plasmids for CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in were generated through a series of overlapping PCR amplifications using Phusion DNA polymerase followed by sub-cloning into pJET plasmid. Plasmids for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (wt SpCas9) were generated using established protocols [64] in order to create plasmids that would direct genome editing at the 5' terminus of the HsISG15 ORF (exon 2). pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 62988). All sequences are available by request. HepaRG cells grown in 6 well dishes were co-transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 editing plasmids targeting the beginning of the ISG15 ORF in exon 2 (exon 1 contains only the ATG of the ORF), and homology donor plasmids described above (1 \u03bcg each) using Lipofectamine 2000 and the protocol described above. Transfected cells were selected using puromycin (Life Technologies) (1 \u03bcg/ml) and blasticidin (Invivogen) (10 \u03bcg/ml) until non-transfected cells were no longer viable. Selected cells were cloned by single cell dilution, expanded and tested for EGFP induction following IFN stimulation. Positioning of the introduced transgene was assessed by PCR amplification on isolated genomic DNA from individual clones (S5C Fig). Primers were designed to include one primer internal to the transgene and another external to the transgene and found in the target loci (sequences available on request). For use as an effective IFN reporter cell line, cells had to demonstrate robust induction of EGFP expression following stimulation with IFN and evidence of specific introduction of the transgene. This study uses clone 'G8' of HepaRG.EGFP-BSD-ISG15 cells. We have not tested whether there is a single transgene integration site or multiple ones nor confirmed that the EGFP produced following stimulation by IFNs results from the expression of the specifically-introduced transgene rather than off-target integration, which is theoretically possible. We do not predict this would affect the cells' ability to act as a reporter cell line. For use in IFN reporter assays, stimulated cells (in 96 well plates stimulated for 24 hrs;~5 x 10 4 cells per well) were washed, trypsinised and fixed in formalin (1% in PBS) at room temperature for 10 mins in the dark before being transferred to a round-bottomed plate and stored at 4\u02daC in the dark until measurement of EGFP fluorescence. Non-stimulated cells were used as negative controls and the change in % EGFP-positive cells was assessed by flow cytometry using a Guava easy-Cyte HT (Merck Millipore). For fluorescence microscopy, EGFP induction was measured by indirect immunofluorescence of stimulated cells that were fixed and permeabilised on coverslips prior to antibody binding. An EGFP primary antibody (1:1000, rabbit ab290 Abcam) was used followed by a fluorescent anti-secondary antibody (1:500, Goat anti Rabbit Alexa-Fluor, Thermo Fisher, 568nm). Samples were counter-stained using DAPI and visualised with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710) under identical conditions.",

EMCV was grown on Vero cells followed by titration on U2OS cells by plaque assay. IAV stocks were generated on MDCK cells and titrated by plaque assay on MDCK cells with protease (TPCK-treated trypsin, Sigma Aldrich). ZIKV was titrated on Vero cells by plaque assay. For all plaque assays, cells were grown in 12 or 6-well plates to~90% confluency before inoculation with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus stocks in serum-free Optimem. Inoculum remained on the cells for 2 hrs before removal and the monolayers were rinsed with PBS (1x) and semi-solid Avicell overlay (Sigma Aldrich) was added. For EMCV and IAV, 1.2% Avicell was used, diluted in 1x DMEM 10% FCS, 1% penicillinstreptomycin. For IAV titration, TPCK-treated trypsin was added (1 \u03bcg/ml).

At first, we used reported lists of differentially-expressed genes between humans and chimpanzees but further validated observations with raw data from human studies. Studies focusing on acute HCV infection (0 to 26 weeks) in humans and chimpanzees were acquired through manual literature search using Pubmed and gene lists were compiled. For chimpanzees, data was acquired from 4 studies [34] [35] [36] [37] and one report was employed for human data [33] . The study by Dill et al. comprised single biopsy samples from each of six individuals, while in toto the chimpanzee studies combined data from ten animals with multiple, serial biopsies. All studies were carried out using similar Affymetrix microarray platforms except Nanda et al. who used IMAGE clone deposited arrays. Although similar microarrays measured different numbers of genes we focused on 'core' shared genes from chimpanzee studies. Humans were infected with HCV genotype (gt)1 (n = 2), gt3 (n = 3) and gt4 (n = 1) while chimpanzees were experimentally infected with HCV gt1a (n = 6), gt1b (n = 3) and gt2a (n = 1). The human dataset included individuals with IL28B rs12979860 genotypes T/T, C/T and C/C but no association between IL28B genotype and gene expression was noted (33) . Gene names and fold-changes were manually converted to a single format (fold change rather than log2 fold change for example) to allow comparative analysis. Human biopsies were taken between two and five months after presumed infection following known needle-stick exposure, and serial chimpanzee biopsies were taken at different time points from between one week and one year after HCV infection. For comparative purposes, differentially-expressed genes in chimpanzees were included if they were detected during a time period overlapping with the human data. We identified a 'core' set of chimpanzee differentially-expressed genes (independently characterized in at least two studies) and compared them to the single human transcriptome study data at equivalent time points (between 8 and 20 weeks post-infection). This approach generated a set of core chimpanzee genes (genes found differentially-expressed in at least 2 studies, >2 fold change compared to controls and during the time frame compared to humans) for comparison with the human data. This is reflected in the ten-fold higher numbers of differentially-regulated genes found in the one human study compared to the 'core' (reduced) set assembled from four chimpanzee studies. To validate these findings, we used three studies of chronic infection for which data were available [56, 70, 71] , two from humans employing RNA-Seq and one from chimpanzees using microarray measurement. Gene lists were extracted and a core human list was produced and compared to that from chimpanzees. For shared genes, the fold change values were compared for humans and chimpanzees. The ratio of chimpanzee induction to human induction was calculated.",

All human and animal genomic and transcriptomic datasets were obtained from either publicly-available data or published data. We note that all data collected in the original studies was subject to ethical approval, details of which are available in the original study manuscripts. For data in panels A and B, expression and glycosylation of all naturally-occurring variants of HsIFN\u03bb4 were examined. Experiments included a series of controls including HsIFN\u03bb3op (contains no glycosylation sites), EGFP and the HsIFN\u03bb4 TT variant (negative controls) as well as non-natural variants of HsIFN\u03bb4 (N61A, F159A, L162A). N61A is predicted to abrogate glycosylation of HsIFN\u03bb4. Panel A shows a representative Western blot for the production and glycosylation of HsIFN\u03bb4 variants of lysates from plasmid-transfected producer HEK293T cells as detected with an anti-FLAG ('FLAG') primary antibody. Tubulin was used as a loading control. A non-specific band in the EGFP-transfected extract is shown ( \u00c3 ). Panel B shows the quantification of intracellular glycosylated (green) and non-glycosylated (blue) HsIFN\u03bb4 variants by Western blot analysis of lysates from plasmid-transfected producer HEK293T cells. Ratio of glycosylated to non-glycosylated is shown above the graph. Two-fold differences from wild-type are highlighted in bold. Data shown are mean +/-SEM combined from three independent experiments. (TIF) HsIFN\u03bb4 is shown. (B) Briefly, Tri-JFH1 cells were treated with CM containing wt HsIFN\u03bb4 or HsIFN\u03bb4 K154E alongside a negative control (EGFP) at a dilution of 1:2 for three days before repeat passaging at a ratio of 1:6 into EGFP-or HsIFN\u03bb4-containing CM, again at a 1:2 dilution. This treatment and passaging were repeated 8 times over a total of 25 days. Cells were grown in 6 well plates. At each passage, a proportion of cells was stored for RNA extraction and quantification of HCV SGR RNA levels by RT-qPCR. HCV RNA relative to GAPDH was quantified for wt (orange) and K154E (purple) HsIFN\u03bb4-treated cells, and expressed relative to the amount of RNA in the paired EGFP-treated cells. The arrow indicates a stage in the experiment where the cells were incubated for 4 instead of 3 days and reached confluency, which likely reduced HCV replication. The data show the mean and SD of biological duplicates. (C) At the end of the experiment (P8, 25 days), the cells were plated into a 96 well plate without either wt or K154E HsIFN\u03bb4 and then fixed the following day in ice-cold methanol prior to staining for HCV NS5A antigen by indirect immunofluorescence to determine the number of cells harbouring replicating HCV RNA. Representative fluorescence microscopy and brightfield images are shown. Scale bars represent 400 \u03bcm. isolated from CM (purple), intracellular lysate (blue) and immunoprecipitated CM (orange) for variants encoding E, K, R or D at position 154 in an anti-EMCV CPE assay relative to CM for wt HsIFN\u03bb4 (K154 variant) in HepaRG cells. (C) Detection of intracellular IFN\u03bb4 from different species as well as select mutants at position 154 (E, K, D and R) by Western blot analysis of lysates from plasmid-transfected producer HEK293T cells. The IFN\u03bb4 variants were detected with an anti-FLAG antibody. Tubulin was used as a loading control. These samples were taken from the same experiment as in Fig 6E. A lower molecular weight product detected by the anti-FLAG antibody, which is potentially a degradation product, is highlighted with a '#' (D) Alternative images from repeats of detection of extracellular IFN\u03bb4 from different species by Western blot analysis of samples of FLAG-tag immunoprecipitated CM (1 ml) from plasmid-transfected producer HEK293T cells. A BAP-FLAG fusion protein was used an immunoprecipitation control (POS). IFN\u03bb4 variants were detected with an anti-FLAG antibody. A lower molecular weight product detected by the anti-FLAG antibody, which is potentially a degradation product, is highlighted with a '#'. An upper band running near to the IFN\u03bb4 species is shown ( \u00c3 ) which is likely antibody fragments from the immunoprecipitation reaction. (E) Ratio of E154 to K154 for antiviral activity (all) or protein amounts (IP or LYS) of IFN\u03bb4 found in CM, intracellular lysate and immunoprecipitated CM; where possible, data from the different species is combined.

Both inhibitors were used at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml. HEK-293T cells transfected with plasmids were treated with inhibitors and controls at~18 hpt and incubated for a further 24 hrs in the presence of the drug before luciferase activity were measured.

Inferred evolution of position 154 in humans and chimpanzees. The last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees encoded the highly-conserved glutamic acid (E) at position 154 (purple). E154 was retained in chimpanzees but sequentially modified in the genus Homo, which includes humans and Neanderthals. Homo IFN\u03bb4 was first modified by substitution of E154 to lysine (K) (orange) and subsequent emergence of the frameshift TT allele (grey) or by the introduction of other substitutions that reduce activity (P70S [blue], L79F [yellow]). The TT allele also encodes the codon for K154. E154 (pink) re-emerged in Pygmies.IFN\u03bb4 in humans with only the E154K change remains in the population and is considered wild-type ('wt').

Both IFN\u03bb4 E154 (purple) and K154 (orange) are produced and glycosylated (grey circle) to similar levels inside the cell but IFN\u03bb4 E154 is secreted more efficiently compared to IFN\u03bb4 K154 (highlighted by blue arrows) and has enhanced potency. Subsequently, IFN\u03bb4 E154 induces more robust interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression (for example: ISG15, IFIT1, MX1) in target cells, leading to greater antiviral activity. S3 Data.

(B) Western blot analysis of intracellular IFN\u03bb4 from different species encoding E or K at position 154 as well as equivalent E and K variants of HsIFN\u03bb3op. HEK293T cells were transfected with the relevant plasmids for 48 hrs prior to preparation of cell lysates. IFN\u03bb4 variants were detected with anti-FLAG antibody ('FLAG') and tubulin was used as a loading control. Mock-and EGFP-transfected cells were used as negative controls.(C) EMCV antiviral assay in HepaRG cells of IFN\u03bb from the different species indicated (human [Hs], chimpanzee [Pt] and macaque [Mm]) encoding an E (red bars) or K (black bars) at position 154 alongside the equivalent amino acid substitutions in HsIFN\u03bb3op. Antiviral activity is shown relative to that for HsIFN\u03bb4 in HepaRG cells. Order denotes wt then variant IFN\u03bb for each species.
