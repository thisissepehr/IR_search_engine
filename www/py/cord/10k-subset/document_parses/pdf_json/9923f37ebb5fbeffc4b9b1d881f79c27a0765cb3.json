The study evaluated which formulation provided the best balance of immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety. It showed that, in children aged 3-5 years and those aged 6-9 years, HI responses against the vaccine-homologous strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) fulfilled CBER licensure criteria with all 3 formulations, whereas local events in the half-dose formulation tended to be lower than those in the other formulations [9] . In our study, we evaluated 2 doses of vaccine that contained 1.9 \u00b5g of H5N1 HA adjuvanted with AS03 B but were made using a different production process and strain, A/Indonesia/5/2005, to expand the clinical experience with this type of vaccine in children as young as 6 months and as old as 17 years.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 400, "end": 403, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 824, "end": 827, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We observed robust HI antibody responses after 2 doses of vaccine containing 1.9 \u00b5g of H5N1 HA adjuvanted with AS03 B , thus confirming the antigen-sparing potential of the vaccine.

Interestingly, a modest age-dependent decrease in GMT was observed, with lower responses with increasing age. The unexpected strength of the immune response in the youngest children suggests that those with the least previous exposure to influenza A virus are able to mount the greatest HI antibody response to the adjuvanted vaccine. Following H5N1 influenza vaccination, low postvaccination antibody titers have been reported in subjects who had previously received seasonal influenza vaccination, compared with those who had not [18] [19] [20] [21] . Preexisting antibodies resulting from seasonal influenza virus infection or vaccination are suspected of having a negative effect on the immune response elicited by subsequent doses of influenza vaccine [22] . Also, it has been hypothesized that previous vaccination with a nonadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine might lead to the shifting of the T-cell and/or B-cell repertoires toward epitopes specific for the antecedent vaccine, thus affecting the ability of immune system to evoke an immune response against subsequent vaccination and resulting in lower HI titers [21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 942, "end": 946, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 947, "end": 951, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 952, "end": 956, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 957, "end": 961, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1171, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1539, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "HI antibodies persisted for 1 year after vaccination in the vast majority of children, although some age-related differences in persistence were observed.
