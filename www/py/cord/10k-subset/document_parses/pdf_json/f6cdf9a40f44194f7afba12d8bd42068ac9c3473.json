The depth of dormancy differed depending on Raunkiaer's life-form and shoot habits. Chamaephytes with perennial shoot-axes showed shallower dormancy than hemicryptophytes with annual shoot-axes, and geophytes with annual shoot-axes showed the deepest dormancy. The results strongly suggest that the dormancy is more endogenously controlled in forbs less hardy to freezing stress. Potential growth ability of alpine herbaceous chamaephytes in autumn is an adaptive advantage, since they utilize the short vegetative period as long as possible. All of the species with annual shoot-axes had winter buds covered with scales. In plants with perennial shoot-axes, percentage of winter buds covered with scales increased with increasing depth of dormancy. The results indicate that the shoot apices are well protected by bud scales in forbs with a long endogeneous-dormant period.",

Alpine snow-patch plants lack an endogenous dormancy, or at any rate the period of dormancy has only a very short duration (Ru\u00a8bel 1925; S\u00f8rensen 1941 ). This appears to be related to low risk of frost injuries under the snow cover, and this condition enables the plants to start growth as soon as snow disappears. The dormancy of alpine plants living in windswept ridges is more endogenously controlled than alpine snowbed plants (Ko\u00a8rner 1999) . This property enables the plants to avoid careless growth during the unfavorable season at the habitat, where they experience winter sunshine and daytime canopy warming above 20\u00b0C (Ko\u00a8rner 1999) . The percentage of arctic plants that have no endogenous dormancy in terms of the development of flower organs increased in late snow-free localities (S\u00f8rensen 1941 ). An adaptive significance of this lack of endogenous dormancy was considered to be an effective utilization of even a very short period with favorable temperatures for continued development (S\u00f8rensen 1941) . On the other hand, little information is available on the relationship between the depth of dormancy and frost hardiness. This study focuses on this relationship in alpine and subalpine perennial forbs.",

The shoot apices grow during the current growing season and survive during the unfavorable season, and the persistent shoot apices resume growth in the next growing season.

These forbs exhibited potential growth ability at warm temperatures in autumn, although their growth was reduced in their native habitats. The initiation of growth of chamaephytes with perennial shoot-axes (mean \u00b1 SD, 18.7 \u00b1 15.6 days) and of hemicryptophytes with perennial shoot-axes (19.8 \u00b1 6.0 days) occurred much earlier than in hemicryptophytes with annual shoot-axes (35.0 \u00b1 16.4 days in 33 species; one species did not initiate growth within 250 days). The results indicated that chamaephytes and hemicryptophytes with perennial shoot-axes showed a much shallower dormancy in autumn than hemicryptophytes with annual shoot-axes. In nine species of geophytes with annual shoot-axes, seven species did not initiate growth within 250 days. They never sprout leaves and stems in autumn in native habitats. These results indicate that geophytes have the most endogenously controlled dormancy of all the plant groups.",

The results strongly suggest that the dormancy is more endogenously controlled in forbs less hardy to freezing stress. The percentage of herbaceous chamaephytes (such as cushion plants and passive chamaephytes) for which the shoots were persistent increased at high altitude (Raunkiaer 1934) . The results suggest that the percentage of forbs with shallow dormancy increases at high altitude. Potential growth ability of alpine herbaceous chamaephytes in autumn is an adaptive advantage, since they can then utilize as much of the short vegetative period as possible. Chamaephytes tended to flower and elongate stems or flower-stalks normally during the experimental period, suggesting a shallow dormancy (see the Appendix).",

In general, active plant organs are less resistant to freezing stress than inactive dormant organs. Although the buds of geophytes are protected from severe low temperatures below the ground, breaking the dormancy and activating the buds in autumn would lead to serious frost damage. Geophytes avoid the activation of buds by exhibiting the deepest dormancy.",

In these less-productive habitats, an prolonged life-span of the shoot axis increases the efficiency of use of carbon and nutrients, and is potentially an adaptive advantage for photosynthetic carbon gain, as has been indicated before for plant leaves (Chapin 1980; Chabot and Hicks 1982; Kudo 1992) .
