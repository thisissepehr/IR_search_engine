In particular we show the importance of publicly available biological and clinical repositories to support systems medicine studies. Second, we discuss how the integration and analysis of multiple types of omics data through integrative bioinformatics may facilitate the determination of more predictive and robust disease signatures, lead to a better understanding of (patho)physiological molecular mechanisms, and facilitate personalized medicine. Third, we focus on network analysis and discuss how gene networks can be constructed from omics data and how these networks can be decomposed into smaller modules. We discuss how the resulting modules can be used to generate experimentally testable hypotheses, provide insight into disease mechanisms, and lead to predictive models.

It generally involves a combination of wet-lab experiments and computational (bioinformatics) approaches. Systems medicine extends systems biology by focusing on the application of systems-based approaches to clinically relevant applications in order to improve patient health or the overall well-being of (healthy) individuals [ 1 ] . Systems medicine is expected to change health care practice in the coming years. It will contribute to new therapeutics through the identifi cation of novel disease genes that provide drug candidates less likely to fail in clinical studies [ 2 , 3 ] . It is also expected to contribute to fundamental insights into networks perturbed by disease, improved prediction of disease progression, stratifi cation of disease subtypes, personalized treatment selection, and prevention of disease. To enable systems medicine it is necessary to characterize the patient at various levels and, consequently, to collect, integrate, and analyze various types of data including not only clinical (phenotype) and molecular data, but also information about cells (e.g., disease-related alterations in organelle morphology), organs (e.g., lung impedance when studying respiratory disorders such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and even social networks. The full realization of systems medicine therefore requires the integration and analysis of environmental, genetic, physiological, and molecular factors at different temporal and spatial scales, which currently is very challenging. It will require large efforts from various research communities to overcome current experimental, computational, and information management related barriers.

The term \"bioinformatics\" was fi rst coined by the Dutch theoretical biologist Paulien Hogeweg in 1970 to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems [ 4 ] . Soon, the fi eld of bioinformatics expanded and bioinformatics efforts accelerated and matured as the fi rst (whole) genome and protein sequences became available. The signifi cance of bioinformatics further increased with the development of highthroughput experimental technologies that allowed wet-lab researchers to perform large-scale measurements. These include determining whole-genome sequences (and gene variants) and genome-wide gene expression with next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS; see Table 1 for abbreviations and web links) [ 5 ] , measuring gene expression with DNA microarrays [ 6 ] , identifying and quantifying proteins and metabolites with NMR or (LC/ GC-) MS [ 7 ] , measuring epigenetic changes such as methylation and histone modifi cations [ 8 ] , and so on.

It is worth noting that solely measuring many molecular components of a biological system does not necessarily result in a deeper understanding of such a system. Understanding biological function does indeed require detailed insight into the precise function of these components but, more importantly, it requires a thorough understanding of their static, temporal, and spatial interactions.

This not only contributes to knowledge dissemination but also facilitates reanalysis and metaanalysis of data, evaluation of hypotheses that were not considered by the original research group, and development and evaluation of new bioinformatics methods. The use of existing data can in some cases even make new (expensive) experiments superfl uous.

In contrast, bottom-up approaches aim to develop detailed mechanistic and quantitative mathematical models for sub-systems. These models describe the dynamic and nonlinear behavior of interactions between known components to understand and predict their behavior upon perturbation.

Due Fig. 1 The contribution of bioinformatics ( dark grey boxes ) to systems medicine ( black box ). (Omics) experiments, patients, and public repositories provide a wide range of data that is used in bioinformatics and systems medicine studies to policies of scientifi c journals and funding agencies, omics data is often made available to the research community via public databases. In addition, a wide range of databases have been developed, of which more than 1550 are currently listed in the Molecular Biology Database Collection [ 14 ] providing a rich source of biomedical information. Biological repositories do not merely archive data and models but also serve a range of purposes in systems medicine as illustrated below from a few selected examples. The main repositories are hosted and maintained by the major bioinformatics institutes including EBI, NCBI, and SIB that make a major part of the raw experimental omics data available through a number of primary databases including GenBank [ 21 ] , GEO [ 22 ] , PRIDE [ 23 ] , and Metabolights [ 24 ] for sequence, gene expression, MS-based proteomics, and MS-based metabolomics data, respectively. In addition, many secondary databases provide information derived from the processing of primary data, for example pathway databases (e.g., Reactome [ 25 ] , KEGG [ 26 ] ), protein sequence databases (e.g., UniProtKB [ 27 ] ), and many others. Pathway databases provide an important resource to construct mathematical models used to study and further refi ne biological systems [ 28 , 29 ] . Other efforts focus on establishing repositories integrating information from multiple public databases. The integration of pathway databases [ 30 -32 ] , and genome browsers that integrate genetic, omics, and other data with whole-genome sequences [ 33 , 34 ] are two examples of this. Joint initiatives of the bioinformatics and systems biology communities resulted in repositories such as BioModels, which contains mathematical models of biochemical and cellular systems [ 35 ] , Recon 2 that provides a communitydriven, consensus \" metabolic reconstruction \" of human metabolism suitable for computational modelling [ 36 ] , and SEEK, which provides a platform designed for the management and exchange of systems biology data and models [ 37 ] . Another example of a database that may prove to be of value for systems medicine studies is MalaCards , an integrated and annotated compendium of about 17,000 human diseases [ 38 ] . MalaCards integrates 44 disease sources into disease cards and establishes gene-disease associations through integration with the well-known GeneCards databases [ 39 , 40 ] . Integration with GeneCards and cross-references within MalaCards enables the construction of networks of related diseases revealing previously unknown interconnections among diseases, which may be used to identify drugs for off-label use. Another class of repositories are (expert-curated) knowledge bases containing domain knowledge and data, which aim to provide a single point of entry for a specifi c domain. Contents of these knowledge bases are often based on information extracted (either manually or by text mining) from literature or provided by domain experts [ 41 -43 ] . Finally, databases are used routinely in the analysis, interpretation, and validation of experimental data. For example, the Gene Ontology (GO) provides a controlled vocabulary of terms for describing gene products, and is often used in gene set analysis to evaluate expression patterns of groups of genes instead of those of individual genes [ 44 ] and has, for example, been applied to investigate HIV-related cognitive disorders [ 45 ] and polycystic kidney disease [ 46 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 781, "end": 787, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1253, "text": "[ 21 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1266, "text": "[ 22 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1281, "text": "[ 23 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1301, "end": 1307, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1561, "text": "[ 25 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1575, "text": "[ 26 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1629, "text": "[ 27 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1784, "end": 1795, "text": "[ 28 , 29 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1950, "text": "[ 30 -32 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2058, "text": "[ 33 , 34 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2272, "end": 2278, "text": "[ 35 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2424, "text": "[ 36 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2545, "text": "[ 37 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2728, "text": "[ 38 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2892, "end": 2903, "text": "[ 39 , 40 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3476, "end": 3486, "text": "[ 41 -43 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3832, "end": 3838, "text": "[ 44 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3921, "end": 3927, "text": "[ 45 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3958, "end": 3964, "text": "[ 46 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 255, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Information Management for Systems Medicine"}, {"text": "Several repositories such as miR2Disease [ 47 ] , PeroxisomeDB [ 41 ] , and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) [ 43 ] include associations between genes and disorders, but only provide very limited phenotypic information.

ClinVar is another example and provides an archive of reports and evidence of the relationships among medically important human variations found in patient samples and phenotypes [ 49 ] . ClinVar complements dbSNP (for singlenucleotide polymorphisms) [ 50 ] and dbVar (for structural variations) [ 51 ] , which both provide only minimal phenotypic information. The integration of these phenotype repositories with genetic and other molecular information will be a major aim for bioinformatics in the coming decade enabling, for example, the identifi cation of comorbidities, determination of associations between gene (mutations) and disease, and improvement of disease classifi cations [ 52 ] . It will also advance the defi nition of the \"human phenome,\" i.e., the set of phenotypes resulting from genetic variation in the human genome. To increase the quality and (clinical) utility of the phenotype and variant databases as an essential step towards reducing the burden of human genetic disease, the Human Variome Project coordinates efforts in standardization, system development, and (training) infrastructure for the worldwide collection and sharing of genetic variations that affect human health [ 53 , 54 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 41, "end": 47, "text": "[ 47 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 63, "end": 69, "text": "[ 41 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 107, "end": 113, "text": "[ 43 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 404, "end": 410, "text": "[ 48 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 592, "end": 598, "text": "[ 49 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 664, "end": 670, "text": "[ 50 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 709, "end": 715, "text": "[ 51 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1106, "text": "[ 52 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1628, "text": "[ 53 , 54 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Public Databases in Systems Medicine"}, {"text": "To implement and advance systems medicine to the benefi t of patients' health, it is crucial to integrate and analyze molecular data together with de-identifi ed individual-level clinical data complementing general phenotype descriptions.

Although good reasons exist for making clinical data available (Subheading 2.2 ), ethical and legal issues comprising patient and commercial confi dentiality, and technical issues are the most immediate challenges [ 56 , 57 ] . This potentially hampers the development of systems medicine approaches in a clinical setting since sharing and integration of clinical and nonclinical data is considered a basic requirement [ 1 ] .

The power of phenome analysis was demonstrated in a study involving 1.5 million patient records, not including genotype information, comprising 161 disorders. In this study it was shown that disease phenotypes form a highly connected network suggesting a shared genetic basis [ 67 ] . Indeed, later studies that incorporated genetic data resulted in similar fi ndings and confi rmed a shared genetic basis for a number of different phenotypes.

Moreover, single-omics disease signatures which combine multiple (e.g., gene expression) markers have been constructed to differentiate between disease subtypes to support diagnosis and prognosis. However, no single technology can reveal the full complexity and details of molecular networks observed in health and disease due to the many interactions across these levels.

Also in the area of systems medicine challenge-based competitions may offer a framework for independent verifi cation of model predictions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 446, "end": 459, "text": "[ 145 , 146 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 718, "end": 725, "text": "[ 147 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 790, "end": 797, "text": "[ 146 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1190, "text": "[ 148 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1406, "text": "[ 149 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Systems medicine promises a more personalized medicine that effectively exploits the growing amount of molecular and clinical data available for individual patients.
