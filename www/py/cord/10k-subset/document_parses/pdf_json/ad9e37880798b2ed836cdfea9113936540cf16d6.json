All patients were treated with minocycline, and all recovered, excluding one patient with a fulminant course. Fever and exanthema were observed in all patients, and an eschar was pointed out in 20 (71%) patients. The platelet count was 10 \u03eb 10 4 /\u00b5l or lower in 8 (28%) patients. The fibrin degradation product (FDP)-level was abnormally high, 10 \u00b5g/ml or more, in 16 (57%) patients. The creatine kinase (CK) value was high in 14 of 22 patients, suggesting the presence of myositis. The leukocyte count, FDP, C-reactive protein, and soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2-R) levels were significantly higher in severe cases. In the group without concomitant steroid therapy, mean times of 54.7 h and 101.4 h were required to reduce the temperature to 38\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C or lower, respectively, after the initiation of tetracycline treatment. There were 6 severe cases: 1 with disseminated intravascular coagulation, 2 with multiorgan failure, 1 with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 2 with meningoencephalitis. These severe cases formed a group that required 6 or more days to initiate therapy after the onset (P \u03fd 0.005 vs non-severe group), showing that delay in diagnosis and therapy is the major cause of aggravation. In the 2 patients complicated by multiorgan failure, the sIL2-R level, produced by activated lymphocytes, was 10 000 U/ml or higher, suggesting that an sIL2-R level of more than 10 000 U/ml can be used as a marker of poor prognosis. It may be better that moderate to severe cases are treated with minocycline plus short-term steroid therapy.",

Excluding 1 patient who died, a definite diagnosis of JSF was determined by confirming an increase in specific IgM antibody titer in serum or a fourfold or more increase in the specific mixed (IgG, IgA, and IgM) antibody titer in paired sera, determined by the fluorescent antibody method or enzyme-labeled antibody method in the recovery stage. All patients were treated with minocycline, and the fever patterns were investigated by measuring body temperature four or more times daily after the initiation of therapy. White blood cell count, platelet count, fibrin degradation product (FDP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatine kinase (CK) measured on admission before therapy were investigated. In some patients, soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2-R) was measured before therapy as a marker of lymphocyte activation. Aggravation of JSF was determined by observing complications by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or organopathy such as respiratory failure and disturbance of consciousness as indices. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, Pearson's coefficient of correlation test, and Fisher's exact test.",

Patients' ages ranged from 12 to 78 years, and there were 23 males and five females; that is, many patients were males. The disease onset was more frequent in summer, from May to November (Fig. 1 ). An eschar was pointed out in 20 (71%) patients. On physical examination, fever and exanthema were observed in all patients. The degree of exanthema varied, from generalized erythema to less noticeable cases with a few exanthemas on the trunk that may have been missed if not carefully examined. Initiation of therapy began 1 to 9 days after the onset (median, 4 days). The platelet count at initiation of therapy was 0.9 \u03ea 26.7 \u03eb 10 4 /\u00b5l and the count was 10 \u03eb 10 4 /\u00b5l or lower in 8 (28%) patients.

The CK value was abnormally high in 14 of 22 patients in whom CK was measured on admission. There was no correlation between the CK and CRP values (r \u03ed 0.0605).

Mean times of 54.7 \u03ee 17.6 h and 101.4 \u03ee 84.8 h were required to reduce the temperature to 38\u00b0C or lower and 37\u00b0C or lower, respectively (data values are means \u03ee standard deviation). In the analysis excluding patients complicated by meningoencephalitis, mean times of 53.2 \u03ee 17.6 h and 77.9 \u03ee 22.2 h were required to reduce the temperature to 38\u00b0C or lower and 37\u00b0C or lower, respectively. The number of days required to initiate therapy after the onset and the time required for fever reduction were not correlated (r \u03ed 0.0155). There were six severe cases: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (n \u03ed 1); multiorgan failure (MOF) due to DIC (n \u03ed 2); DIC complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n \u03ed 1); and complicating meningoencephalitis (n \u03ed 2).

Excluding the one patient with the fulminant form who died within a few hours after admission to our hospital, all patients recovered. Two patients with severe cases complicated by ARDS and MOF were treated with minocycline plus steroids. The symptoms improved smoothly. In two patients complicated by MOF, the sIL2-R level was markedly high, more than 10 000 U/ml, showing excess activation of lymphocytes. Laboratory data were compared between severe cases and non-severe cases.

The platelet count and the FDP value were negatively correlated, and coagulation disturbance was more marked in severe cases. This finding may have reflected the pathology of rickettsiosis, that is, rickettsiae grow mainly in vascular endothelial cells and damage the endothelial cells. The high frequency of elevated CK values suggested the presence of complicating myositis. Isozyme was examined in some patients with elevated CK values, and the isozyme was MM type in all these patients (data not shown). The white blood cell count and the CRP value before therapy were positively correlated. Although leukocytosis was observed in some severe cases, it was unlikely to be caused by complication of bacterial infection, because in these patients, it took days for the diagnosis, and beta-lactam antibiotics were fully administered during that period in most patients.",

In our two patients with MOF, the level of sIL2-R produced by activated lymphocytes were 10 000 U/ml or higher, suggesting that an sIL2-R level of more than 10 000 U/ml can be used as a marker of poor prognosis. In our patients, the sIL2-R level was lower in mild cases. Because a high sIL2-R level is due to excess activation of T lymphocytes and suggests the presence of hypercytokinemia, 17 concomitant steroid therapy is appropriate for severe cases, in terms of the inhibition of abnormal activation of lymphocytes. Measurement of sIL2-R is convenient and may be useful in screening for the presence of excessive activation of lymphocytes. Because the most severe case complicated by MOF was healed by the administration of minocycline plus a single dose of 500 mg of methylprednisolone 4 and no minocycline-resistant Rickettsia japonica has been reported, mild cases of JSF should be treated with minocycline alone. And it may be better that moderate to severe cases are treated with minocycline plus shortterm steroid therapy. However, therapy that causes excess immunosuppression, such as steroid pulse therapy, should be carefully administered, because it has a risk of aggravating the clinical course of JSF.",

The mortality rate of tsutsugamushi disease was reported to be 7% in untreated classical cases, while the mortality rate of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the pre-antibiotic era was 20%-25%, and the recent mortality rate, due to delay Fisher's exact test; P \u03fd 0.005 in the diagnosis and therapy, was reported to be 5%. 18, 19 Compared with these mortality rates, it is important to recognize that the mortality rate of JSF may be similar to that in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is the most lethal rickettsiosis.
