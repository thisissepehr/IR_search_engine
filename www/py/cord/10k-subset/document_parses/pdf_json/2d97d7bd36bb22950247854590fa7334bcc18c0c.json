Species identification, especially by histopathological examination, is often difficult because of morphologically similar parasites such as Eimeria species. In this study, we used histopathological, bacteriological, virological, and parasitological methods to identify the cause of the disease in two piglets with severe diarrhea. Villous atrophy, diffuse necrosis, and flattening of mucosal epithelial cells were found in the ilea of examined piglets, and coccidian parasites were found in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. In some merozoites in the meronts, the presence of two nuclei indicated type 1 merozoites, characteristic of C. suis. According to Cystoisospora-specific PCR targeting the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) gene, the sequences of the products were 98.5% similar to those of C. suis. Escherichia coli (O149 serogroup) exhibiting a virulence factor profile (LT, STb, and EAST1 as toxins and F4 as a colonization factor) was detected in one piglet. No other bacteria or significant enteric viruses were found. Co-infection with C. suis and E. coli could imply aggravation of the disease, although further study is needed to assess the pathogenicity of this interaction. This study is the first to clarify by molecular analysis the sequences of C. suis detected in piglets in Japan.",

C. suis in particular leads to serious disease in suckling piglets, causing diarrhea and dehydration mainly in animals 2-4 weeks of age (Mundt et al. 2005) . Eimeria species are thought to be less pathogenic (Rommel 1992) , although some species, including Eimeria suis, Eimeria polita, and Eimeria spinoisa, may cause clinical signs such as fever, diarrhea, and weight loss in young weaned pigs (Jones et al. 1985; Lindsay et al. 2002) . Parasites of both genera infect intestinal mucosa, mostly of the small intestine, and generate asexually and sexually at the infected sites; oocysts are then shed in the feces. Until now, morphological characterization of oocysts by direct smear or flotation techniques has been used to detect parasites and identify their species (four sporozoites in two sporocysts in C. suis, and two sporozoites in four sporocysts in Eimeria species). However, it is impossible to identify the species of intracellular developmental zoites based only on histopathological examinations of intestinal tissue sections.",

To obtain more DNAs of the parasites, DNA was also purified from the cryopreserved ilea of two piglets using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To identify Cystoisospora species, PCR was performed to target the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) gene (approximately 440 base pair [bp] primer set ITSGF-ITSR2) (Samarasinghe et al. 2008) . Each PCR amplification was conducted in a reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl. A negative control containing reagents without a template was included in each PCR batch. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized on a UV transilluminator. PCR products were purified using a QI-Aquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH) and sequenced in Makoto Matsubayashi et al. 408 both directions on an ABI 3130 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., CA, USA). The obtained sequences were aligned with the representative nucleotide sequences of Entamoeba species or genotypes using ClustalW with initial fixed parameter values (DNA Data Bank of Japan [DDBJ], http://clustalw.ddbj.njg.ac.jp/top-j.html). Homology searches using the obtained partial gene sequences were performed using the FASTA program (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search/fastaj.html). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining algorithm with evolutionary distances computed using the Tamura-Nei model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The resulting tree was generated using the MEGA software package (version 5; Tamura et al. 2011 ).",

We constructed a phylogenetic tree of the ITS1 gene (Fig. 3) , although only a small number of Cystoisospora species (seven species from five hosts) have been Makoto Matsubayashi et al. 410 deposited in GenBank. Consequently, the isolate in the present study clustered with C. suis, and C. anthochaerae from Anthochaera carunculata was closely related as a sister clade. The other species formed each host-specific clade. It can be taken as a valid result that the isolate detected are C. suis.",

It is possible that this parasite is widespread in Japan. Although the age of the piglets at the infection has been previously shown to be crucial for the outcome like diarrhea and mortality (Stuart et al. 1982; Mundt et al. 2003) , disturbances in the intestinal flora caused by the infection are also considered to play a role for pathogenesis such as clostridial overgrowth (Mundt et al. 2008; Mengel et al. 2012) .
