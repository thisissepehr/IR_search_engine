In the TCZ-QW and TCZ-Q2W groups, 56.0% and 53.1% of patients, respectively, achieved sustained remission compared with 14.0% in the PBO126 group (both p<0.0001) and 17.6% in the PBO152 group (both p 0.0002). Patients with relapsing disease were in relapse-free remission longer and thus had lower risk for flare (hazard ratio) versus placebo when treated with TCZ-QW than with TCZ-Q2W. Hazard ratio (99% CI) for flare in relapsing patients was 0.23 (0.09-0.61) for TCZ-QW and 0.42 (0.14-1.28) for TCZ-Q2W versus PBO126 and 0.36 (0.13-1.00) for TCZ-QW and 0.67 (0.21-2.10) for TCZ-Q2W versus PBO152.

Most experimental studies of NMO lesional events in vitro and in animal models have emphasized complement-mediated inflammation and astrocyte cytolysis. These are late events, associated with extensive blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. The BBB does not absolutely restrict CNS entry of IgG, but it does exclude macromolecular C1q, essential for activating the classical complement cascade. Patients' sublytic CNS lesions reflect events documented in vitro after IgG binds to AQP4: AQP4 internalization, attenuated glutamate uptake, intramyelinic edema, interleukin-6 release, complement synthesis, release and activation, inflammatory cell recruitment and secondary demyelination (Lucchinetti et al, Brain Pathol 2014; Hinson et al, JExpMed 2008 , PNAS 2012 T. Vincent et al, JImmunol 2008) . Early events initiating these pathophysiological outcomes are poorly understood. Contributions of the AQP4-IgG-activated astrocyte are largely neglected: synthesis and secretion of complement, cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory mediators attracting NMOcharacteristic granulocytes (Howe et al, Glia 2014; Walker-Caulfield et al, JNeuroinflamm 2015) .",

Multi-Modality Therapy in Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis in an Adult Male Sumanjit Kaur, Daniel Graf and Chilvana Patel. Galveston, TX Background: ADEM is a monophasic inflammatory demyelinating disease affecting the brain and spinal cord that presents within days to weeks of infection or immunization, and is characterized by multifocal sensory and motor symptoms. ADEM is common in children, however adults have a fulminant course. Pediatric prevalence, male predominance, encephalopathy, paraplegia, widely disseminated ill-defined perivenular lesions on MRI with frequent basal ganglia involvement distinguishes ADEM from Multiple sclerosis. ADEM is self-limiting, various treatment including steroids, Intravenous Immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and immunomodulatory therapy may hasten recovery. Studies assessing treatment efficacy are lacking. Sudden onset, severe neurologic symptoms and unresponsiveness to glucocorticoids carries poor prognosis.",

We identified novel Kv1.3-channel dependent mechanisms in pro-inflammatory microglial activation including MHCI trafficking and MHCI-dependent antigen presentation by microglia to CD81 T cells.

CNS MP Kv1.3-channels may represent therapeutic targets in neuroinflammatory conditions. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) and limbic encephalitis closely associate with LGI1-antibodies. FBDS have a clinically-recognisable semiology and often predate the onset of the cognitive impairment (CI). We describe 103 consecutive patients with FBDS and LGI1-antibodies and characterise the clinical, therapeutic and serological differences between those with and without cognitive impairment (CI), and to determine whether cessation of FBDS can prevent CI. The 22/103 patients without CI typically had normal brain imaging, EEGs, sodium levels (p<0\u00c10001) and almost exclusive IgG4 LGI1-antibodies (p50.009), versus the frequent IgG1-antibodies in patients with CI (p50.03). Overall, cessation of FBDS with antiepileptic-drugs alone occurred in only 9/89 (10%) patients. In contrast, 30 days after immunotherapy initiation, 51% had cessation of FBDS (p<0\u00c10001); an effect which was more rapid in those without CI (p50.038). Every week of delayed immunotherapy conferred a 5% relative reduction in the probability of FBDS cessation, and shorter time to immunotherapy (p50\u00c1031) and absence of CI (p50\u00c10014) predicted reduced disability at 24-month follow-up. Furthermore, of 80 patients with FBDS as their initial feature, 56% developed CI after 90 days of active FBDS. In contrast, only one patient developed CI after cessation of FBDS (p<0\u00c10001). FBDS show a striking time-dependent response to immunotherapy. Prompt immunotherapy appears to prevent development of CI, maybe via inhibiting IgG1-mediated complement deposition.",

Visual acuity (VA) was 20/200 in the right (R) eye and 20/800 in the left (L) eye with afferent pupillary defect (APD) on the left and pain with eye movements. The remainder of her neurologic examination was normal. MRI brain and orbits demonstrated moderate to severe stable ventriculomegaly and a small area of abnormal enhancement in the distal segment of the left optic nerve as evidence for optic neuritis. MRI spine was negative for demyelinating lesions. Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed normal pressure, WBC (40), protein (22) and myelin basic protein (6.06). Rest of serum and CSF inflammatory and infectious markers were negative. She received 5 days of solumedrol and was discharged home with a steroid taper. On day of discharge, her VA was much improved with her R eye (20/25) and L eye (20/70). At clinic follow up a few weeks later, patient's VA was stable and she was found to have slight disc edema on the L. However a few weeks later, patient again developed subacute left visual disturbance. VA in L eye was 20/400, with color desaturation and APD. Repeat CSF studies were unremarkable. She underwent another course of solumedrol with repeat improvement in her vision.

While nicotinic ganglionic acetylcholine receptor autoimmunity has been commonly reported in dysautonomia and peripheral neuropathy, this type of autoimmunity has rarely been shown to cause encephalopathy.

The c-Abl Inhibitor, Nilotinib, as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Chronic Cerebellar Ataxia Chan-Young Park, Hye-Rim Shin, Seon-Jae Ahn, Yoonhyuk Jang, Woo-Jin Lee, Han Sang Lee, Jin-Sun Jun, Yong-Won Shin, Tae-Joon Kim, Jangsup Moon, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Kyung-Il Park, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Sang Kun Lee and Kon Chu. Seoul, Republic of Korea Chronic cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a neurologic disorder that progressively deteriorates patients' quality of life. However, currently established treatments for chronic CA remain in the level of symptom alleviation. Nilotinib (Tasigna V R ) is a potent inhibitor of non-receptor tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL that penetrates blood-brain barrier. As recent evidences suggest that nilotinib might be effective in treating chronic CA, we present twelve cases of chronic CA who were nonresponsive to other treatment options (modified Rankin scale [mRS] scores of >2) and received daily nilotinib therapy. Twelve patients (four males and eight females) were followed-up for 10.1 6 3.1 (range 5-16) weeks with nilotinib treatment (daily doses of 150-300mg). According to underlying etiologies, four patients were classified as autoimmune, three as degenerative, three with genetic, and two with idiopathic. At nilotinib initiation, the median mRS score was 3.5 (range 3-4). At follow-up, improvement in mRS scores was observed in 7/12 (58.3%) patients (P50.016) and a favorable outcome (mRS scores of 2) was reported in 6/ 12 (50.0%) patients. For the responders, clinical improvement was noticed in 0.5-3 weeks after drug initiation, and maintained throughout the treatment without severe adverse events. In the analysis of pre-treatment MRI findings, atrophic changes in cerebellar vermis was negatively associated with favorable outcomes (P50.005). Pontine atrophy (P50.061) and cerebellar hemispheric atrophy (P50.080) also showed a tendency of being negatively associated with favorable outcomes. Etiologic categories of CA was not significantly associated with functional outcomes (P50.182). These findings indicate that nilotinib might improve functional outcomes of the patients with chronic cerebellar ataxia with a favorable safety. The clinical response to nilotinib might be detected in early treatment phases. Not underlying etiologies, but atrophic changes in cerebellar and brainstem structures might predict a negative responsiveness to nilotinib. S117.

Anti-GM1 IgG Antibody in Central Nervous System (CNS) Inflammatory Diseases Hye-Rim Shin, Seon Jae Ahn, Han Sang Lee, Tae-Joon Kim, Jin Sun Jun, Jangsup Moon, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Kyung-Il Park, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Sang Kun Lee and Kon Chu. Seoul, Republic of Korea Though GM1 is a major ganglioside in the CNS of higher vertebrates, CNS disease associated with anti-GM1 antibodies are rarely reported. Nevertheless, there are several reports describing acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with high titer anti-GM1 IgG antibodies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of anti-GM1 IgG antibodies have influence on symptoms and treatment effects in CNS inflammatory diseases. Between January 2010 and December 2016, a total of 1604 patients underwent serum anti-GM1 IgG ELISA tests (B\u20ac uhlmann Laboratories AG, Switzerland) at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea. One hundred and twenty-seven patients were tested positive. Using to International Classification of Diseases-10 code, 621 and 799 patients were classified as central and peripheral nervous system disorders, respectively. Further classification of CNS diseases needs to be performed using medical records, lab results, and brain images. The kit used in this study is known to have positive results in 1-2% of the normal population. We believe the results of our study will guide the clinicians' decision on diagnosis and treatment in CNS inflammatory diseases with positive serum GM1 IgG results. S120WIP.

Cystinosis appears to preferentially affect the \"where\" system, with impairment in visual spatial function but not in visual perception. These results suggest that the gene for cystinosis plays a role in brain development, with alterations in dorsal stream development in particular. Herein, we present a demonstrative case of a large located arachnoid cyst in an elderly patient with significant behavioral changes and cognitive decline and briefly review the literature of behavioral changes and arachnoid cysts. An 89year-old male with history of vascular dementia presented to the emergency room after a fall. Family reported a rapid decline in cognitive function in the past 6 months. According to family the patient had displayed periods of behavioral changes, with aggressive behavior, word finding difficulty in the past few months. Patient had periods in which he \"wasn't there,\" during which he did not answer any questions or initiate any conversation. MRI revealed a large cyst with midline shift, characterized as a large loculated extraaxial CSF-like fluid collection centered in the right sylvian fissure and extending along the entire right convexity. Septations along the anterior and posterior margins with thinning of the adjacent bone were seen. Mass effect with effacement of the sulci and compression of the right lateral ventricle was noted by 10 mm midline shift to the left and a subfalcine herniation. This most likely consistent with an arachnoid cyst.",

Our results demonstrate that maladaptive behavioral responses to dopaminergic therapy reflect differences in ventral striatal activity and connectivity, and that mesocorticolimbic network synchrony is related to incentive-based learning proficiency. We propose a model in which DAAs produce ICDs by increasing activity at the ventral striatum and connectivity with the limbic loop, thus enhancing reward-reinforced learning and hedonic behavior. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures near-infrared light attenuation to quantify hemodynamic response. This technology can be used to measure bloodoxygenation-level dependent response (BOLD) in the same manner as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in brain tissues. fNIRS has been used to delineate differences in functional brain responses, particularly in cortical areas such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Current implementations of fNIRS are capable of penetrating up to 4 cm deep. At this depth, studies have demonstrated that fMRI and fNIRS measurements are highly correlated. While fNIRS is a newer technology for measuring brain activity, it has advantages both scientifically and economically as compared to fMRI. fNIRS is relatively inexpensive, portable, and offers flexibility in research design similar to that of electroencephalography (EEG) measures. Additionally, fNIRS is quiet with less mobility restrictions which can be appealing to individuals with anxiety conditions such as claustrophobia. Movement artifact is far less problematic. In fact, fNIRS can employed when participants are asked to move such as in gait studies. For these reasons, fNIRS would be an excellent method to study brain function, such as prefrontal activity during aging. To date, fNIRS has been used in only a limited extent to study prefrontal activity in the oldest old or in the context of successful cognitive and brain aging. In this review, we will discuss the basic theories and methods of fNIRS, including its application in the study of functional brain activity changes in neurological disorders.

Expectation effect acting upon olfactory perception has been described in both laboratory and group setting (Slosson, 1899; O'Mahoney, 1978) . Alternately this may represent change in focus of attention to olfactory stimulus. The non-olfactory sensory cues cause him to seek olfactory stimulation. Attention to olfactory stimulation may thus enhance olfactory ability, which allowed him perceive an aroma (Spence, 2001) . Verbal or non-chemosensory sensory cues may have induced the patient to form a mental image of the source of the aroma, which would then act to enhance his olfactory ability in detecting this odor (Kollndorfer, 2015) . Alternatively, this may be a chemosensory equivalent to confabulation of Korsakoff syndrome, where there is a tendency for the mind to fill in the gap in sensory experience, a proclivity towards continuity (similar to what appears in the visual sphere with incomplete illusions with the Law of Closure) (Vernon, 1962) . Such contextual induction of olfactory experience may be utilized in helping to train or refine olfactory ability in those with olfactory loss. S130. Network Localization of Free Will Perception Ryan Darby and Michael D. Fox. Boston, MA While the existence of free will remains controversial, our perception that our actions are freely willed is not. This perception of free will is thought to involve two processes: the motivation to move, referred to as a sense of volition; and the feeling that movement is voluntary, referred to as a sense of agency. Focal brain lesions can impair the perception of free will; lesions impairing volition result in akinetic mutism, while lesions impairing agency result in alien limb. However, lesions in several different locations can cause each of these clinical syndromes, making it difficult to localize disorders of free will perception to specific neuroanatomical locations. Here, we test an alternative hypothesis: that lesions impairing free will perception localize to a unique network of brain regions, rather than a single location. This hypothesis is motivated by evidence that symptoms emerge from sites functionally connected to a lesion location, not just the lesion location itself. To test this hypothesis, we first identified 28 lesions causing akinetic mutism, and 53 lesions causing alien limb. Lesions were spatially heterogeneous, and no single location was involved in the majority of cases for either syndrome. Next, we used a new technique called lesion network mapping to determine brain regions functionally connected to each lesion location. 100% of lesions causing akinetic mutism were functionally connected to the same location in the anterior cingluate cortex (ACC). Connectivity to this region was specific to lesions causing akinetic mutism but not lesions causing loss of movement with intact volition (hemiparesis). Lesions causing akinetic mutism were significantly connected to the peak region identified in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies evaluating volition. Similarly, 93% of lesions causing alien limb were connected to the same location in the precuneus cortex. Again, connectivity to this region was specific when compared to a group of patients with involuntary movements but intact sense of agency (hemichorea). Lesions causing alien limb were also significantly connected to the peak region identified in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies evaluating sense of agency. Finally, we found that the precuneus and ACC regions identified in our analyses were part of a common functional brain network. Taken together, our results suggest a network localization for free will perception, lending insight into the neurobiology of this unique phenomenon.",

Omaha, NE and Ann Arbor, MI Background: Our overarching goal is to measure real-time effects of neurocognitive dysfunction in safety-critical realworld tasks such as automobile driving. This study addresses effects of encephalopathy due to blood glucose (BG) changes in type 1 (T1) insulin-dependent diabetes (DM). DM drivers have elevated crash risk in association with repeated brain exposure to abnormal fluctuations in BG levels, low and high. Method: To tackle this safety critical neurocognitive problem, we recorded continuous data (4 weeks; 3,687 drives) from sensors installed in 35 drivers' own vehicles (19 DM; 16 without DM) and measured real-time BG levels in the DM drivers using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We tested the hypothesis that real-world DM driver risk is linked to at-risk BG levels (<70; >300 mg/dL). Results: DM drivers (1,940 drives) had atrisk BG 17.96% of total study time, elevating the risk of driving while impaired. DM drivers had at-risk BG 13% of time during driving (<70 mg/dL, 3.4%; >300 mg/dL, 9.6%), showing insufficient self-restriction. Driver risk in DM (based on vehicle accelerometer profiles) exceeded controls' even during euglycemia to moderate hyperglycemia (b 5 0.14, SE 5 0.04, p 5 <0.001). DM driver risk in impaired BG states (particularly hypoglycemia) exceeded control risk, particularly on high-speed roadways (b 5 0.01, SE 5 <0.01, p 5 <0.001). Individual DM driver behavior modeled as a function of BG mirrored across-group comparisons. DM drivers performed worse that controls in visual search and multi-tasking while driving (b 5 0.57, SE 5 0.3, p 5 0.05). State DMV records showed DM drivers accounted for all crashes (N 5 3) and 85% of citations (N 5 13) in the two years preceding the study. Results show that vehicle sensor and physiologic data can be successfully linked to quantify individual driver performance and behavior in drivers with metabolic disorders that affect brain function (encephalopathies). Discussion: Real-time BG is linked to momentary real-world changes in DM driver behavior. Behavior fluctuations and risk are driven by exposure to at-risk BG levels, particularly hypoglycemia, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Real-world sensor data coupled with phenotypes of driver behavior can inform patients, caregivers, interventions (education, training, medical), policy, and design of supportive in-vehicle technology responsive to driver's momentary neurocognitive state.",

We have previously shown that neurons contain the prothrombin (FII) gene and under stress will secrete the protein. We created neuronally targeted FII knockout mice under tamoxifen induction. We prepared conditioned media from neurons with or without FII KO during OGD, and applied the media to WT or PAR-1 KO astrocytes. Conditional knockout and wild type mice were subjected to MCAo to study the effect on astrocyte activation and infarct volume. Media from OGD neurons contains thrombin; the media stimulates astrocyte activation; such astrocyte activation can be reproduced with low doses of thrombin; and media-induced astrocyte activation is blocked by either thrombin inhibitor or by knocking down or knocking out PAR-1 from the astrocytes. In vivo, after neuronal FII knockout, MCAo induced infarction was significantly enlarged and correlated with reduction of astrocyte activation. Both activation and infarct reduction were partially restored by Lentivirus mediated prothrombin gene restoration into the KO mice. Our recent data powerfully confirm that thrombin constitutes a necessary and sufficient signal from neurons to activate adjacent astrocytes in a PAR-1 dependent manner, which appears to influence infarct volume.

S138. Transient Aphemia in a Patient with Progression of Symptoms from an Evolving Infarct Derrick A. Fox, YongXing Zhou, Roger L. Weir and Annapurni J. Trouth. Washington, DC Aphemia is a speech disorder characterized by difficulty with speech articulation with retained ability to write language. Also termed apraxia of speech (AOS), aphemia is easily confused with Broca's aphasia until language assessment renders the ability to communicate through writing. Patients with aphemia are rare in part because the blood supply of the affected area is the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which also supplies the left inferior frontal gyrus, significant for Broca's region of the brain. AOS has been shown to have anatomical correlation to the left precentral gyrus (Ogar, Brain and Language, 2006) . It is rare to see an isolated aphemia case previously only shown in several case reports. A review of the literature revealed three cases with transient episodes that improved significantly (Feng, Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, 2015; Ottomeyer, Journal of Neurology, 2008; Fox, Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery, 2001; Ojha, Neurology India, 2011 ). An extensive literature review of case reports documented only one notable presentation of persistent AOS (Ojha, Neurology India, 2011) . A 72-year-old male with transient and fluctuating onset of aphemia for seven days before he presented to our hospital. Nine days after his hospital presentation his symptoms progressed to Broca's aphasia, accompanied by right hemiparesis and dysphagia. He was initially found to have infarctions of the left precentral and postcentral gyrus on MRI. Interestingly, serial imaging revealed an evolving large infarction, now expanding to the left inferior frontal gyrus. Work-up during hospitalization revealed occlusion of left M1 to M2 segments of the MCA on head and neck MRA. Cardiac tests including telemetry monitoring, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were negative for embolic source to date. Prior to the infarct, the patient was not taking aspirin. Dehydration and hypernatremia could have played a role in the evolution of the infarction as the patient was eating and drinking less during the subacute period of his stroke yielding a lower mean arterial pressure. The patient's relatively decreased perfusion even beyond the permissive hypertension window may have caused enhancement of the anatomical territory affected by the stroke. The patient's symptoms plateaued and he was started on cardiac event monitor. He was started on aspirin, high dose statin, oral hypoglycemic agent and his anti-hypertension medication regimen was reoptimized allowing for more liberal control of systolic blood pressure below 140.",

Over 100,000 carotid revascularization procedures are done annually in the US for asymptomatic carotid arterial stenosis. The safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), and the efficacy of medical therapy in altering the progression of atherosclerosis have improved. Therefore, the applicability of prior randomized trials in asymptomatic carotid stenosis to current treatment decisions has been called into question. The aim of the NINDSfunded CREST-2 is to compare CEA and intensive medical therapy (IMT) versus IMT alone (n51240), and CAS and IMT versus IMT alone (n51240), through two parallel randomized clinical trials. CREST-2 is leveraging the NINDS clinical trials network known as StrokeNet (University of Cincinnati, Coordinating Center). The composite primary outcome is any stroke or death within 44 days after randomization or ipsilateral ischemic stroke thereafter up to 4 years. Secondary outcomes include cognitive function, which is assessed on a regular schedule through computer-assisted telephone interview. IMT is directed centrally and includes tight control of blood pressure (systolic target < 140 mm Hg) and cholesterol (LDL target < 70 mg/dl) as well as lifestyle coaching. As of March 27, 2017, the Site Selection Committee has approved 131 sites, of which 100 (76%) have enrolled at least one patient. The Surgical and Interventional Management Committees have credentialed 342 surgeons and 143 interventionists. An additional 117 interventionists have been approved to submit additional cases via the CREST-2 Companion Registry, providing a CMSreimbursed pathway for full credentialing in CREST-2. Social media tools are being used to inform potential participants about the trial. 543 patients have been randomized, 250 (46%) patients in the endarterectomy trial, and 293 (54%) patients in the stent trial. In addition to continued recruitment and ongoing follow-up, a major goal this year is roll-out of an MRI-based substudy known as CREST-H (Randy Marshall, MD, Columbia University, Study PI), with a primary aim being the study of the cognitive effects of revascularization in patients with hemispheric hypoperfusion.",

Midbrain-Pontine Junction Cavernous Angioma with Interval Hemorrhage and Development of Unilateral Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration Jared S. Rosenblum, Matthew A. Nazari, Yasir Al-Khalili and Erol Veznedaroglu. Philadelphia, PA Several cases of Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) have been reported, none directly following interval bleed of a stable midbrain-pontine cavernous angioma (CA). HOD is a rare phenomenon in the dento-rubro-olivary pathway first described by Oppenheim in 1887. It is a an uncommon condition and creates unique diagnostic, observational, and therapeutic challenges. We report a case of development of unilateral HOD with interval hemorrhage of a midbrainpontine junction cavernous angioma, summarize the literature on HOD, suggest a possible mechanism and comment on the management of the CAs in light of HOD. A 57year-old female with multiple known CA in the frontal-, parietal-lobe, and midbrain and occipital approach VP shunt for hydrocephalus and history of ruptured and clipped aneurysm, presents 10 months from last follow up with gait instability, ataxia, headache, blurred vision and dysarthria. CT scan of the head showed the known CA without significant change as compared to prior studies. MRI of the brain showed a well-defined lobulated lesion in the left parasagittal midbrain and superior pons with characteristic mulberry appearance. The lesion demonstrated heterogeneous appearance with T1-and T2-hyperintensity centrally with thin margin of T2/GRE hypointensity peripherally, similar to studies 10 months prior. The CA decreased in size from 17 x 15 x 22 mm 10 months prior, to 11 x 10 x 13 mm at present. There was interval development of a 7mm round T2 hyperintense focus within an enlarged left lateral superior medulla. The two additional CAs-in the frontal and parietal lobes-were noted to be stable since prior studies which indicates a familial pattern. Despite the presence of the midbrain-pontine junction CA in our patient on previous imaging, HOD was not present and the patient was asymptomatic. Progressive neurological deterioration followed apparent interval bleed of the CA evinced by reduced size of the CA, surrounding GRE sensitive blood product, and 7mm round T2 hyperintense focus within a slightly enlarged left lateral superior medulla consistent with HOD. While the appearance of HOD has been reported in the literature following resection of midbrain and pontine cavernous angiomas, this is the first report to our knowledge of interval bleed directly leading to the development of HOD. The development of HOD may represent a compelling benchmark for resection of midbrainpontine CAs considering that it is a reported complication of resection.",

Moreover, literature has reported an acquired form of von Willebrand Syndrome in AS patients which indirectly has cerebrovascular effects. Gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been reported in AS patients, but no cerebral AVMs. Thus, considering the utility of cerebral angiograms to assess cerebral AVMs in AS patients is crucial.

Our patient presented 12-hours following an elective TACE procedure for a known hepatocellular carcinoma with sudden onset aphasia and right sided weakness in the window for both tPA and IAT. Her MRI brain revealed restricted diffusion in the subcortical basal ganglia more prominent on the left side. Nonetheless, her presentation included striking cortical symptoms of aphasia and homonymous hemianopia. Given the disconnect between imaging studies and clinical presentation, she underwent digital subtraction angiogram that revealed completely patent intracranial vessels. Her labs were significant for elevated ammonia of 81 uMol/L. Her AST increased from 61 unit/L before TACE to 250 unit/L after TACE and ALT increased from 51 to 61. Her Platelets count was 84 K/CMM and her INR was 1.29. With medical management, she showed steady improvement and recovery to her neurological baseline. We postulate that this presentation can be explained by dysfunctional flow and energy metabolism due to hyperammonemia rather than tissue ischemia secondary to acute vascular occlusion. Reduced MCA blood velocity in cirrhotic patients has been reported. Impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow has been shown in a small cohort of patients with Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). Studies using positron emission tomography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography have shown significantly reduced brain oxygen metabolism and cerebral blood flow in HE. Characteristic MRI changes of acute brain injury including T2 hyperintensity can be seen with acute hyperammonemia and patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. This case demonstrates the importance of distinguishing noncerebrovascular stroke mimics from acute ischemic stroke, and highlights the need to carefully assess background pathophysiology when evaluating patients exhibiting stroke-like symptoms. In this patient population, we suggest assessing Ammonia level and coagulopathy as part of the acute stroke evaluation.",

Non-fluent/agrammatic PPA (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by isolated and progressive speech and language impairments caused by anatomical damage in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsal insula, supplementary motor area (SMA), striatum, inferior parietal and temporal regions. These regions are linked to form a specific network for speech production, and are compromised in nfvPPA. However, it is not known whether and how this network is topologically distinctively organized in nfvPPA to address this damage. Recently, advanced mathematical models have been introduced to investigate the complex relationships between connected brain regions. We applied graph theory to compare the topological configuration of the speech production network in nfvPPA and the healthy brain. First, we defined the speech production and default mode networks in healthy subjects with a ROI-based approach using resting state functional MR data. Graphs were built by defining nodes with a parcellation of the entire network's maps in the healthy subjects. Edges were defined as functional connectivity between each pair-wise node extracted for each subject. For both groups, we extracted graph-theory measures to identify the hubs of the network (nodal degree and betweeness centrality), quantify information flow efficiency (global efficiency) and cluster organization (modularity and cluster coefficient). We found that the speech production network in nfvPPA did not show the same topological configuration as controls. In the left hemisphere, hubs were not present in the left frontoparietal regions, and they were located more anteriorly within the frontal regions. Additional hubs were also identified in the right hemisphere. Global metrics showed a network of speech production less efficiently wired and less optimally clustered in nfvPPA. No differences were found in the topological organization of the default mode network. Additionally, after simulating the damage of disease in healthy controls after excluding the nodes that lost their designation as hubs in nfvPPA, we observed that the new configuration of hubs was similar to that obtained in nfvPPA. These results suggest that nfvPPA presents a hierarchical reorganization within the speech production network, essentially downshifting operations to hubs less centrally important to the healthy network and that the reorganization is widespread and specific to this network with loss and gain of crucial hubs and decreased global efficiency. Graph theory is a promising technique to understand the pathophysiology of network-level dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. S166. Biologically Produced Abeta Species Induce AD-Related Pathological Phenotypes In Vitro Mariko Sawa, Xu Chen, Orlangie Natera, Matthew Pearn and William Mobley. La Jolla, CA Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is growing in prevalence. The molecular pathogenesis of AD starts decades prior to clinical diagnosis; so early detection and intervention is critical to halting it's progression; perhaps even abating symptoms altogether. An early and critical neuronal phenotype of AD is accumulation and enlargement of early endosomes (EE) and increased activation of Rab5. EE enlargement contributes to neurodegeneration by impairing axonal transport of trophic factors necessary for neuronal survival. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormalities, we employed the conditioned medium (CM) of a CHO cell line (7PA2) which expresses the human Indiana mutation of APP (APP V717F); CM7 is used to designate this CM. Wild type CHO cells are used as a control; CMC is used to refer to this CM. CM7 contains biologically relevant amyloid beta (Abeta) species including soluble oligomers. We assessed the effects of CM7 in PC12 cells and rat primary neurons. We observed that 2hr-treatement of CM7 induced abnormalities in; endosomal pathways, neurotrophin signaling, axonal trafficking and synaptic structures. Immunodepletion analysis showed that Abeta42 is responsible for these phenotypes. In addition, CM of 7PA2 cells pretreated with c-secretase modulator, GSM15606, diminished the abnormalities led by CM7. We conclude that CM7 recapitulates AD related cellular abnormalities in vitro, and Abeta 42 was the responsible to those phenotypes. We will discuss the molecular linkages between Abeta species and the AD-related pathologies. Heterozygous loss of function mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major autosomal dominant cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and most likely cause disease through progranulin haploinsufficiency. Homozygous GRN mutations that produce complete progranulin deficiency cause the lysosomal storage disorder neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), revealing that progranulin is critical for proper lysosomal function. Impaired lysosomal function may also play a role in FTD due to GRN mutations (FTD-GRN), as brains from FTD-GRN patients exhibit elevated levels of lysosomal proteins. As in humans, progranulin-deficient mice (Grn -/-) exhibit lysosomal abnormalities, with elevated levels of lysosomal proteins, complex changes in lysosomal enzyme activity, and accumulation of lipofuscin granules throughout the brain. In this study, we investigated whether brains from Grn -/mice and FTD patients with GRN mutations exhibit similar lysosomal abnormalities, and tested whether restoration of progranulin to Grn -/mice would reverse these abnormalities. Brains from FTD-GRN patients and Grn -/mice exhibited similar changes in the activity of several lysosomal enzymes, including reduced activity of b-glucocerebrosidase (GBA), an enzyme with previously reported abnormal trafficking in progranulin-deficient cells. Grn -/mice also exhibited additional enzymatic changes not present in FTD-GRN samples. Restoration of progranulin to Grn -/mice by intracranial injection of an adeno-associated viral (AAV)-progranulin vector normalized activity of GBA and other lysosomal enzymes and reduced lipofuscin levels throughout the brain. These data indicate that lysosomal dysfunction due to progranulin deficiency is reversible, which supports the use of progranulin-boosting therapies for FTD-GRN patients and NCL patients with GRN mutations, particularly in the early stages of disease.

Chronic ShK-223 treatment resulted in lower CD81 T cell activation in the brain, and lower Ab plaque load and size especially in the hippocampal formation, without affecting recruitment of CNS-infiltrating macrophages or phagocytic properties of CNS-MPs.",

Background: Previous studies have linked a Mediterraneanstyle diet to reduced risk of dementia in New York and Chicago populations with reductions ranging from 35-50%. While these studies have provided solid information regarding dietary modification of risk reduction for dementia in urban populations, it is unclear if the benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet extend to early cognitive decline such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or to populations with high cerebrovascular risks such as those found in the strokebelt. The present study was undertaken to explore these issues.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Although no reports exist in the literature implicating untreated MDS in PML, recognition of PML in the absence of overt immunosuppression is increasing. Treatment with mirtazapine has been suggested because of the theoretical blocking of JC virus spread through 5HT-2 receptors; however, continued review of these cases may help determine potential therapies for these patients. Treatment with low-dose IL-2 has shown promise in case reports,; this treatment has recently been implemented in our patient, and disease progression will be followed. Our patient's slow progression prior to IL-2 treatment suggests that occult opposed to overt immunosuppression may have implications on prognosis. Apathy is a common symptom in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. The neural substrates of apathy in aMCI may involve multiple brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex and the temporo-parietal region. Here we investigated proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in brain regions that may underlie apathy in aMCI patients. Twenty-eight aMCI patients with varying degrees of apathy and 20 matched controls completed neuropsychological assessments and 1H-MRS. Spectra were acquired from single voxels in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and right temporo-parietal cortex (TPC). Spearman partial correlations between metabolite concentrations in each region and severity of apathy were determined. Additional analyses of covariance were performed to compare high and low apathy patients. Degree of apathy was negatively correlated with choline and myo-inositol (mI) in the TPC. Additional exploratory analyses suggested that N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/mI was reduced in aMCI without apathy group but not in the aMCI with apathy group. In the DACC, glutamate and glutamine (Glx) levels tended to be higher in the aMCI with apathy group and reduced in association with depression scores. Apathy in aMCI patients is associated with neurometabolite changes indicative of altered membranal integrity and glial function in the right TPC. The apparently contrasting associations of Glx in the DACC with apathy versus depression deserve further investigation. We conclude that, in a clinically diagnosed aMCI cohort, apathy symptoms may be suggestive of neural changes that are distinct from aMCI without apathy. Targeted The objective was to investigate the effect of alpha synuclein antisense oligonucleotides on the spread and toxicity of a pathological form of alpha synuclein. Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease for which there are no approved disease-modifying therapies. Alpha synuclein accumulation is a pathological hallmark of PD. Multiplication of the alpha synuclein gene, SNCA, alone can result in PD. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to target Snca RNA result in reduced production of alpha synuclein and thus have the potential to slow spread of pathology and modulate disease progression. Endogenous mouse and rat alpha synuclein transmission pre-formed fibril (PFF) inoculation models were evaluated. These models are based on intrastriatal injection of alpha synuclein fibrillar fibrils (PFFs) that lead to the deposition and aggregation of alpha synuclein, which accumulates and spreads through neural networks over time. Following characterization of timing of fibril deposition in the models both pre (preventive) and post (therapeutic) fibril deposition paradigms were evaluated with central delivery (intracerebroventricular) of Snca targeting antisense oligonucleotides. Following study completion Snca RNA was evaluated by RT-PCR and phosphorylated alpha synuclein pathology was evaluated histologically. Snca targeting antisense oligonucleotides in both species led to Snca RNA target reduction and slowed deposition and spread of a phospho-specific form alpha synuclein. Antisense oligonucleotides designed against SNCA have the potential to be a disease modifying therapeutic for Parkinson's disease patients.",

I am an employee of Ionis pharmaceuticals and receive a salary from my employment. Antemortem behavioral and anatomic abnormalities have been associated with right hemisphere disease in behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), but postmortem neuropathological examination of hemispheric lateralization of pathology remains to be defined. Here we measured the severity of postmortem grey and white matter pathology using a validated digital image analysis method in four cortical regions sampled from each hemisphere in 24 bvFTD patients, including those with tau (n59), or FUS (n51) proteinopathy. We calculated an asymmetry index based on the difference in measured pathology from each left-right sample pair. Analysis of the absolute value of the asymmetry index (i.e. degree of lateralization independent of direction) revealed highly lateralized pathology for both grey and white matter in all four regions sampled (p<0.01), with relatively greater proportion of pathology in white matter in tauopathies than TDP-43 proteinopathies. Direct inter-hemispheric comparisons of regional pathology measurements found higher frequency of patients with increased grey matter pathology in the right orbitofrontal region compared to the left in the tauopathy group, and for white matter pathology in the right orbital frontal region in the TDP-43 proteinopathy group (p<0.02). We also found increased pathology in the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere in the ventrolateral temporal lobe grey matter in the total cohort (p<0.02). There was a direct association of increasing pathologic burden of pathology with decreasing cortical thickness on antemortem MRI in exploratory analyses of the subset of patients (n515) with imaging data in FTLD-Tau (n57, b5-3.1, t5-3.7, p50.001) and a trend for FTLD-TDP (n58, b5-0.1, t5-1.9, p50.06). Exploratory clinical-pathological correlations demonstrated a higher frequency of patients with a high level of socially inappropriate behaviors in patients with lateralization of pathology in the right orbitofrontal region and reduced semantically-guided category naming fluency was associated with higher burden of white matter pathology in the left ventral-temporal region. We conclude that pathologic disease burden is not distributed symmetrically in behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and this asymmetry of disease burden contributes to the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder. While pathologic burden is lateralized in bvFTD, this is not always to the right hemisphere, and may diverge between tauopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Patterns of region-specific pathology in the right hemisphere as well as the left hemisphere may play a role in antemortem observations of lateralized clinical disease, and these observations may contribute to antemortem identification of molecular pathology in bvFTD. Roughly 40% of patients with Lewy body disorders (LBD) (i.e., Parkinson's disease, PD; PD with dementia, PDD; dementia with Lewy bodies, DLB) have sufficient amyloid plaque and tau tangle pathology for a secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at autopsy. Furthermore, increasing levels of cerebral tau and amyloid pathology in postmortem brains of LBD patients are associated with shorter survival. Thus, antemortem identification of AD copathology has prognostic value in LBD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the protein constituents of AD neuropathology i.e., total-tau (t-tau), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta (Ab1-42) have been extensively studied in the context of AD, but recent work in LBD is largely restricted to living cohorts without postmortem validation.",

Ann Arbor Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of intractable focal epilepsies and has been clearly linked to abnormal MTOR signaling pathway. Recently, genetic mutations in this pathway have been increasingly identified in familial and sporadic focal epilepsies. However, there is no animal model that concordantly recapitulates pathological and electrophysiological changes observed in resected human tissues. Therefore, it has been challenging to develop new effective medical or surgical therapies. Here, we use CRISPR genomic editing tools to establish a novel FCD animal model that shows cortical dyslamination, ctyomegaly and increased intrinsic excitability. Everolimus is able to reverse the increased soma size and ameliorate the seizure burden. We also use genetically engineered human stem cells for in vitro study with hopes to develop a cell-based transplant therapy and a medium-throughput drug-screen platform. Background: The DEPDC5 (DEP domain-containing protein 5) gene, encoding a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, has emerged as a major gene mutated in familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF) and cortical dysplasia.",

None Movement of water and ions, including Cl -, are linked in neurons because these cells do not have aquaporins to move free water. Hyperosmolar therapy is commonly used to treat brain edema. Here we tested if hyperosmotic therapy induces a decrease in epileptiform activity using electrophysiological techniques. Acute and organotypic neocortical brain slices during early development were used to study the effect of a 20 mOsm increase in perfusion solution (by mannitol) on induced and spontaneous epileptiform activity. Epileptiform activity was provoked by omitting MgCl 2 in the artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (aCSF; Low-Mg model) in acute brain slices. Neocortical organotypic slice cultures had spontaneous seizure-like activity in regular aCSF. We observed that: 1) Induced and spontaneous epileptiform activity was decreased by 20 mM mannitol. 2) Spontaneous multi-unit activity (MUA) in the presence of excitatory neurotransmission block resulted in a decrease of MUA frequency but not amplitude. 3) A clinically relevant dose of the GABA A receptor modulator diazepam had insignificant anticonvulsant effects until potentiated by 20 mM mannitol. We conclude that an increase in the extracellular space osmolarity by 20 mOsm leads to a decrease in epileptiform activity in the neocortex in vitro during early development and enhances benzodiazepine actions. Our results suggest that mannitol decreases neuronal [Cl -] i and leads to more inhibitory actions of GABA at this early developmental age. Therapies aimed to decrease neuronal volume and [Cl -] i are another approach to treat neonatal seizures after acute brain injury.",

Irvine, CA 20-year-old girl with history of prematurity born at 32 weeks of gestation, developmental delay and regression, cerebral palsy, spastic quadripararesis, and cerebral palsy diagnosed at age 2-21/2 years. In the past 6-7 years, the patient has developed episodes of tonic posturing mostly induced by excitement, stimulation, and feeding which may occur on a daily basis and lasting about 10 seconds in duration. There is no history of infantile spasms, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures or myoclononus. Patient admitted for long-term video EEG monitoring to characterize the patient's clinical spells and to rule rout underlying epileptic etiology for her symptoms. The patient was not on any anticonvulsant medications during this admission. During sleep, specially on second night of admission when sleep portion was obtained, there were clusters of numerous brief tonic spasms out of asleep. They lasted under 10 seconds in duration and consisted of either bilateral or unilateral (left) arm posturing when the patient raised arms above her head. EEG showed a brief burst of generalized delta activity lasting 1-2 seconds in duration (1-2 hertz, 100-120 microvolts) followed by diffuse rhythmic theta activity lasting 4-10 seconds in duration. The pattern was consistent with remnant of infantile spasms with a component of tonic seizures. The tonic seizures during sleep were not detected by the patient's family. Background: The efficacy of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for rapid and complete elimination of infantile spasms (IS) has been demonstrated in prospective controlled studies (Brunson, Int Rev Neurobiol, 2002) and systematic review (Hancock, Cochrane Library, 2013) . There is a hypothesis that ACTH is not only promoting the release of adrenal steroids, but has additional direct mechanism of influence on the limbic neurons, and these combined effects may explain the robust established clinical effects of ACTH versus steroids and oral antiepileptic drugs in the therapy of IS (Brunson, Int Rev Neurobiol, 2002) .",

Next, a SE alert protocol was developed (Cohort 3). When a patient in clinical SE is identified, staff notify Central Monitoring. Then, Central Monitoring simultaneously pages the general neurology resident, the pharmacist, and the neurointensivist on call, in addition to the rapid response team (RRT) and the house officer. The page reads \"Status epilepticus alert\", followed by the patient's location. In this SE alert protocol, the neurology resident performs a clinical evaluation, enters orders for AEDs, determines need for EEG and neuroimaging, and oversees patient management. The pharmacist verifies orders and dispenses AEDs to the patient's bedside. The neurointensivist and RRT evaluate airway and perform endotracheal intubation if necessary. The house officer is notified for bed assignment purposes in the event that escalations in level of care are required. Local IRB approval was obtained.

Circular RNA (circRNA) is a recently recognized RNA species with covalently closed loop structures. CircRNA is very abundant in CNS, especially in synaptic components. Given that circRNAs are known to act as microRNA (miRNA) \"sponge\", circRNAs can regulate expression of numerous mRNAs by sequestrating miRNA and therefore inhibiting miRNA-mRNA interactions. As altered expressions of numerous miRNAs and relevant mRNAs are involved in pathomechanism underlying chronic epilepsy, we investigated the comprehensive profiling of circRNAs in relation with miRNA and mRNA in a mouse model of chronic epilepsy. The differentially expressed circular RNAs were identified by microarray analysis (Arraystar Mouse circRNA Array V2). Profiles of circRNAs from hippocampus and cortex of the four pilocarpine mouse models were analyzed and compared with those from four control mice. Among the total of 12984 circRNAs analyzed, 26 circRNAs were significantly upregulated (P< 0.05) and 17 were downregulated in hippocampus of pilocarpine mice. Potential target miRNAs that are expected to bind to those differently expressed circRNAs were obtained using bio-informatics and their expression profiles were analyzed using our experimental database. As the result, six circRNA-miRNA pairs of which expression levels were significantly regulated in opposite directions (exclusively in hippocampus of pilocarpine mouse) were further identified. 1066 mRNA targets for the six miRNAs were searched using a database (www.targetscan.org), and 105 mRNAs among them were significantly dysregulated in hippocampus of pilocarpine mouse models. Among them, 24 mRNAs with previously demonstrated role in chronic epilepsy were identified to have relevantly altered of expression profile of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA matches (up-down-up regulation or down-up-down regulation). These findings indicate that circRNAs might have a significant pathomechanistic role in chronic epilepsy. As circRNAs are resistant to RNA exonucleases therefore very stable, circRNA might possibly be a therapeutic target for epigenetic regulation of chronic epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological disease that affects 65 million people worldwide and 3 million in the US. About 30% of these patients do not respond to existing treatments, creating an urgent need for new therapies to address this drug-resistant population. A promising small molecule treatment that has surfaced recently is KPT-350, a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound. SINE compounds inhibit the nuclear export protein Exportin 1 (XPO1) that carries over 200 cargo proteins to the cytoplasm, facilitating certain proinflammatory pathways. Previous work has established antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties of KPT-350 in various animal models. Therefore, it was proposed that inhibiting XPO1 could modulate neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier integrity and aberrant neurogenesis, which are key pathophysiological processes in epilepsy. To determine whether KPT-350 could reduce the epileptic phenotype, the compound was tested in the mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). After 2week baseline SRS monitoring epileptic mice were dosed with vehicle or 0.3, 3 or 7.5 mg/kg KPT-350 PO QoD for 2 weeks. Dosing with 3 and 7.5 mg/kg KPT-350 significantly reduced SRS incidence during the treatment period (p<0.001). A significant number of mice treated with 3 or 7.5 mg/kg KPT-350 responded with a 50% decrease in SRS count when compared to vehicle-treated mice (p<0.001), and 6 out of 24 mice treated with 7.5 mg/kg became seizure free. Furthermore, mice treated with 3 mg/kg showed a sustained reduction in SRS during the 2-week drug washout period; effects at 7.5 mg/kg were not assessed in the washout phase. Additionally, the effects of KPT-350 on the seizure threshold of na\u20ac \u0131ve and epileptic pilocarpine mice were assessed in the acute 6 Hz test. It was found that a single dose of 7.5 mg/kg KPT-350 significantly increased the seizure threshold in epileptic mice, but not in na\u20ac \u0131ve mice. Based on these results, we can conclude that KPT-350 shows promising anti-seizure effects which warrant further investigation.",

New Onset Gabapentin-Induced Myoclonus in Renal Failure: A Case Report Yazan Kherallah, Aaron Desai and Rohit Marawar. Detroit A calcium channel inhibitor, Gabapentin (GBP) is FDA approved for treatment of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia and as an adjunctive treatment for partial seizures. It is most commonly used for non-approved indication of pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. While previous case reports have noted myoclonus as a symptom of GBP (and pregabalin) toxicity, it continues to be an under-recognized adverse drug reaction. Here, we describe the case of a 43 year old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and without any history of seizures who developed confusion alongside multifocal myoclonic jerks involving all extremities one week after initiation of GBP at 300 mg TID for neuropathic pain. Her CBC showed a mild leukocytosis with a WBC of 12.0 as well as an anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.8 and hematocrit of 28.6 (baseline). Her basic metabolic panel that showed an elevated BUN and creatinine of 29 and 8.39 respectively (baseline). Ammonia level was normal. EEG showed generalized slow nonrhythmic activity in the delta/theta frequency range. Patient had multiple myoclonic jerks during the EEG without associated electrographic epileptiform discharges suggesting that myoclonus was subcortical. Discontinuation of the drug and hemodialysis led to improvement of the patient's clinical condition within a day. Although pathogenesis of GBP toxicity causing myoclonus is poorly understood, alterations in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been postulated to play a role. Gabapentin has a high volume of distribution (58 L), is water soluble, not bound to protein, and renally cleared. Hemodialysis can remove approximately 35% of the drug each session. Myoclonus should be suspected as an adverse drug reaction in patients taking GBP, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. With a high index of suspicion, aggressive testing and treatment for other possible conditions like seizures or CNS infections can be avoided. In patients with renal failure and with decreased physiological renal clearance such as the elderly, GBP dose initiation and changes should be conservative. Introduction: Epilepsy affects at least 50 millions individuals worldwide. In two-third of the cases, epilepsy etiology is unknown. Investigations of suspected genetic etiology can often improve diagnostic precision and may guide therapeutic decisions. The process of molecular analysis is complex. Many eligible patients do not complete this diagnostic path. Baylor Genetic Epilepsy Clinic was established to facilitate access to genetic testing in adults with epilepsy. We analyzed our patient cohort referred to date in order to better understand the clinical utility of the genetic testing in adults with epilepsy and potential barriers to completion of testing process.",

Our findings warrant ongoing systematic analysis of patients and their social, cultural, and other personal circumstances. Objective: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is gaining more frequent use in presurgical planning for epilepsy patients. This refined invasive monitoring technique allows for more precise localization of seizure foci, particularly for deep cortical structures, in comparison to traditional grid/ strip electrodes. However, convergent validity between invasive monitoring technique and neuropsychological testing (also key in presurgical planning) has not been established.

New York, NY and Valhalla, NY Objective: Vestibular epilepsy is characterized by focal seizures which manifest clinically with symptoms of disequilibrium and vertigo. Information gleaned from direct cortical stimulation studies as well as stereotactic and surface EEG studies point to multiple cortical areas with vestibular representation rather than the presence of a single vestibular cortex. Vestibular cortical representation is typically localized to the right or left temporal lobe. Rarely, isolated symptoms of vertigo or disequilibrium can be the sole manifestation of epilepsy.

Our patient lacked additional clinical manifestations of focal seizures such as dysmnesic symptoms, sensory changes and automatisms that may confound EEG localization and may be more indicative of cortical spread rather than rising from a primary vestibular cortical focus. Our patient had an episode of dizziness which correlated with a focal seizure on EEG of right temporal onset that resolved after starting Levetiracetam. Patients with vestibular epilepsy have a high rate of response to AED therapy. One third of localization-related epilepsy patients have normal-appearing clinical MRIs. These patients are 2-3 times more likely to have worse outcomes after surgery compared to those with lesions identified on MRI, perhaps due to an inability to accurately identify the epileptogenic focus. We previously demonstrated that the noninvasive, functional, single-slice Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) imaging technique can lateralize and localize epileptogenic regions in the hippocampus on 7T MRI in MRI-negative patients, indicating increased GluCEST signal in the ipsilateral total hippocampus and ipsilateral hippocampal head.

Mortality overall was high but comparable to a similar prevalence studies in another neurology ward in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study helps to identify potentially treatable conditions in which mortality rates are especially high. Future research should seek to understand how mortality relates to other factors during hospitalizations and whether interventions to improve delivery of care to patients at higher risk of mortality may affect patient outcomes. Introduction: There are $2 million HIV1 children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but <1/3rd are on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Seizures are common in HIV1 adults and new onset seizures in HIV1 adults in SSA are often associated with advanced, untreated disease and early high mortality risks. Much less is known regarding HIV and seizures in children in this setting. In developing countries most available antiepileptic drugs (AED) are enzyme-inducing agents at risk of interacting with ARTs, possibly predisposing those on AED and ART combinations to increased drug toxicity and/or the development of antiretroviral resistant strains of HIV. As a result, there is a need to balance risk and benefit of AED initiation in HIV1 children. In April 2016, we commenced a prospective cohort study of new onset seizure in HIV1 children to identify the causes for acute seizures, evaluate the long-term risk of seizure recurrence, and identify risk factors for seizure recurrence.",

Fewer and smaller strokes indicate lower morbidity and mortality in this population, and is consistent with the positive effects of widespread abstinence from cigarettes. Whether other factors in addition to not smoking also contribute awaits further study. Guillain-Barr e syndrome (GBS) is a descriptive disease entity defined by a set of clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory criteria. Various clinical phenotypes exist that may be triggered by different antecedent infectious events. Although the disease appears to affect primarily the elderly in developed countries, but, scenario is different in developing countries. Bangladesh has made an impressive progress towards the eradication of poliomyelitis. However, nonpolio AFP cases are frequently diagnosed, and the incidence rate is currently 3.25 per 100,000 children less than 15 year of age. GBS, an acute polyradiculoneuropathy, is the most frequent cause of AFP. The crude incidence rate of GBS in <15 years of age reported here appears to be 2.5 to 4 times higher than that reported in the literature. We conducted a hospital based observational study including 600 patients fulfilling the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke (NINDS) criteria for GBS patients between 2010 and 2016 in Dhaka Medical College Hospital and National Institute of Neuroscience, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Detailed clinical, electrophysiological, serologic and microbiological data were obtained. GBS affected predominantly in young adults males (M/F52:1) living in rural areas. Antecedent events were recorded in 70% of patients. The most frequent events being gastroenteritis (>40%) and upper respiratory tract infection (18%). Symmetrical weakness and reduced reflexes were found in a majority of 98% patients. Disease course was monophasic in all patients. More than 60% of the patients were bed-bound at entry and about 20% patients required mechanical ventilator. GBS is associated with exceptionally higher deaths (13%) which, is related to lack of ventilator support, disease severity, longer progressive phase of the disease, autonomic dysfunction, and involvement of the bulbar nerve. About 60% of patients had an axonal variant of GBS and evidence for a recent C. jejuni infection was found in 55% of GBS patients. C. jejuni infection was significantly associated with serum antibodies to the gangliosides GM1 and GD1a, and axonal neuropathy. About 90% patients did not receive specific treatment either Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis due to high expensive treatment cost. Finally, GBS in Bangladesh is a severe, predominantly pure motor and axonal neuropathy with a high mortality rate. The majority of the patients do not receive specific and standard treatment with IVIg in view of its high price. Therefore, low-cost treatment strategies are required for GBS patients in developing countries like Bangladesh. Background: CT is often unavailable or unaffordable in low-income countries, creating challenges for patient care and impeding the understanding of neuroepidemiology necessary for policy development. H\u00f4pital Universitaire de Mirebalais in rural Haiti houses the country's first publicly accessible CT scanner at no cost to patients, providing a rare opportunity to study neurologic disease in a rural lowincome setting.",

The most common categories of neurologic abnormalities were traumatic (31%), vascular (25.8%), and infectious (12%). Of 291 strokes, 64% were ischemic (median age at diagnosis 60.8 years, SD 17.4), and 36% were hemorrhagic (median age 52.0, SD 15.5). Evidence of neurocysticercosis was present on 11.8% of CTs (median age 42.6, SD 19.0). Atrophy was noted in 10% of CTs (median age 57.1; SD 23.8), and was characterized as atrophy out of proportion to age in 2% (median age 34.1, SD 15.3). In patients with head trauma, 22.5% had intracranial hemorrhage and 35.5% had fractures. In those scanned for seizures or epilepsy, 17.5% had evidence of neurocysticercosis. In patients undergoing head CT in the setting of known or suspected cancer, 42.7% had evidence of non-CNS tumors and 8.4% had evidence of CNS tumors.

            "text": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is one of the most common and intractable symptoms of diabetes, affecting 25% of diabetic patients. The hallmarks of PDN are neuropathic pain and small fiber degeneration, manifested by the loss of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor axons. Neuropathic pain is associated with nociceptor hyper-excitability in the absence of physiologically appropriate stimuli. In states of neuropathic pain, DRG nociceptors become increasingly responsive to a variety of excitatory influences, including inflammatory cytokines. In particular, we have shown that stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 are necessary for the generation of neuropathic pain in mouse models of PDN. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the hyper-excitability of DRG nociceptors in PDN are unknown, as are the mechanisms leading to small fiber degeneration. This fundamental gap in our knowledge represents a critical barrier to progress in developing novel therapeutic approaches for PDN. The objective of this study is to identify the molecular cascade linking CXCR4/SDF-1 chemokine signaling to DRG nociceptor hyper-excitability, neuropathic pain, and small fiber degeneration in PDN. DRG nociceptors can be identified by a series of molecular markers, including expression of the sodium channel Nav1.8. Indeed, >90% of Nav1.8-expressing DRG neurons are nociceptors. Feeding mice a high fat diet (HFD) for several weeks induces glucose intolerance, obesity, and mechanical allodynia, a particular pain hypersensitivity associated with PDN. Using the HFD model combined with DREADD receptor technology, we have shown that reducing excitability of Nav1.8-expressing neurons prevents and reverse neuropathic pain, neuronal calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, and small fiber degeneration. Furthermore, we have shown that CXCR4 receptors are necessary for neuropathic pain and small fiber degeneration in PDN. Taken together these data demonstrate that Nav1.8 nociceptor hyperexcitability in PDN is driven through the activation of CXCR4 receptors. Inhibition of hyperexcitability can prevent and reverse the development of PDN.

San Francisco, CA Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients and may result in significantly increased health care costs. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and enoxaparin have been proven to decrease the risk of developing a VTE during hospitalization. However, VTE prophylaxis remains underprescribed; a study found that as many as 60% of patients missed at least one dose of enoxaparin and each additional missed dose correlated with increased risk of developing VTE. At our institution, pharmacologic prophylaxis with enoxaparin is typically dosed once daily in the morning, and is interrupted for a variety of clinically warranted reasons including lumbar puncture. Anecdotally, the morning dosing schedule resulted in either missed doses or delayed procedures, so our study group instituted a new protocol to administer prophylactic enoxaparin once daily at 9:00 at night.",

Cryptococcal Meningitis of 11 Years Duration in a Nonimmunocompromised Patient: Isolation of Cryptococcus Neoformans in CSF Obtained by High Cervical Puncture After Prolonged Failure to Detect C. Neoformans or Cryptococcal Antigen in Lumbar CSF Tyler J. Kaplan, Daniel T. Leung and John E. Greenlee. Salt Lake City, UT Meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans is commonly found in immunocompromised individuals but can also occur in patients without identifiable immune deficit. In immunocompromised patients, in particular those with untreated HIV, diagnosis is usually straightforward, with cryptococcal antigen and fungal culture being positive in over 90% of patients. In nonimmunocompromised patients, CSF may contain only small numbers of organisms, and diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis may be more difficult: in such cases, diagnosis has traditionally relied on culture of multiple large-volume CSF samples and repeated determinations of cryptococcal antigen. Here we describe a 67 year old woman without identifiable immunodeficiency who presented in 2006 with diplopia and unsteadiness of gait and was found to have CSF containing 43 white blood cells/ml (100% lymphocytes), and protein of 71 mg/dl. Subsequent lumbar punctures revealed similar pleocytosis, but no organisms were isolated and cryptococcal antigen was not detected. The patient was lost to follow-up but in 2008 developed profound deafness requiring a cochlear implant. In 2011, she presented with progressive confusion and incontinence, and CT scan showed hydrocephalus not seen previously. CSF contained 56 white blood cells, 100% lymphocytes, protein of 238 mg/dl, and glucose of less than 20 mg/dl. The patient improved cognitively after third ventriculostomy, but all diagnostic studies of her lumbar spinal fluid were negative, including bacterial and fungal cultures and cryptococcal antigen. Seven subsequent large volume lumbar CSF collections consistently showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein levels, and hypoglycorrachia, but cultures remained negative, as did cryptococcal antigen and all other studies for infectious organisms. Next generation sequencing of lumbar CSF and later of ventricular CSF obtained at the time of later shunt placement was also negative. In January 2017, C. neoformans was cultured from CSF obtained by C2 cervical puncture. The literature contains two additional cases in which C. neoformans was cultured from cisternal CSF after it could not be detected in CSF obtained by lumbar puncture. Culture of CSF obtained near the basilar meninges by cisternal or high cervical routes may improve detection of C. neoformans and should be considered as an additional diagnostic approach in patients with chronic meningitis in whom the organism cannot be identified in lumbar CSF.",

DHCA/Mal-gluc is also effective in treating depression-like phenotypes in a model of increased systemic inflammation using mice transplanted with hematopoietic progenitor cells from stress-susceptible mice. DHCA can reduce pro-inflammation IL-6 expression through inhibition of DNA methylation at the CpG-rich sequences of the IL-6 at introns 1 and 3 while Mal-gluc can modulate NAc synaptic plasticity through reduction of histone deacetylase 2 expression and increases histone acetylation along the promoter and upstream of the Rac1. Our studies provide novel mechanistic evidence demonstrating cross-talking between the periphery and the CNS at molecular level in depression and the two phytochemicals, through epigenetic mechanisms, can simultaneously and selectively targeting peripheral inflammation and central synaptic maladaptation, the pathogenic mechanisms that are not addressed by currently antidepressants.

Case Description: We report a case of symptomatic AOAD, with onset in the 8th decade, presenting with slow variant orthostatic tremor, which has not been previously described. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed encephalomalacia extending from the medulla to the upper cervical cord on T1 sagittal views. There was corresponding bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensity in the ventral pons, extending inferiorly through the medulla to the level of the upper cervical cord.

He was previously a computer technician, and noted that he was unable to work due to this tremor, which prevented him from typing with accuracy. He was unable to write, nor grab and hold on to objects. His neurologic exam was notable for mild dysarthria, and a low-frequency, moderate-to high-amplitude right arm postural and action tremor, and ataxia on finger-to-nose assessment on the right side. The frequency and amplitude of the tremor varied with certain movements. The patient was tried briefly on propranolol, but was unable to tolerate due to bradycardia. The patient then was placed on valproic acid with minimal improvement in tremor, so he self-discontinued it. Low dose primidone was started, and the patient reported significant improvement in his tremor.

            "text": "The cerebellum and lesions within it can cause various types of abnormal movements. Cerebellar tremor often is classified as an intention tremor, or kinetic tremor, but can have a postural component, and it is rarely a rest tremor. Cerebellar tremors have an irregular amplitude and frequency, with the amplitude and frequency dependent upon the part of the body affected. Cerebellar tremors are difficult to treat. The most common treatment for the kinetic portion of cerebellar tremor is mechanical therapy, i.e. placing weighted objects to the wrist. Pharmacologic therapy can include clonazepam, isoniazid, and carbamazepine; one study reported improvement of cerebellar tremor with tegretol. To date, there have been no published reports of the efficacy of primidone in the treatment of cerebellar tremors secondary to cerebellar hemorrhages. This report demonstrates one case of a patient with cerebellar tremor due to a cerebellar hemorrhage who had significant improvement in his tremor with primidone, after having failed trials of propranolol and valproic acid. Objective: On group level analysis, constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been shown to have moderate beneficial effect in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). However, the individual responsiveness to therapy remains difficult to predict. CIMT is thought to modify interhemispheric inhibition between lesioned and normal hemispheres via modification of white matter connectivity. This pilot study aims at investigating the use of DTI scalars within the pontine corticospinal tracts (CST) and corpus callosum (CC) to predict functional outcomes of CIMT in a cohort of children with unilateral cerebral palsy.",

We describe a patient with a Holmes tremor primarily affecting the head secondary to PML who responded very well to treatment with onabotulinum toxin A. Our patient is a 51 year old man who presented with mild cognitive impairment, dysarthria, and left upper limb clumsiness six months prior to his admission to our institution. Brain MRI revealed innumerable and variably enhancing punctate T2WI abnormalities throughout the cerebral hemispheres and the posterior fossa and CSF showed increased intrathecal IgG synthesis. A presumptive diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made, dimethylfumarate was started and he received several courses of low and high dose steroids. A slowly progressive clinical deterioration led to the diagnosis of AIDS and PML based upon evolving, multifocal, MR lesions and the presence of JV virus DNA in the CSF. Following the initiation of HAART there was further clinical deterioration consistent with the development of IRIS and approximately two months after the initial appearance of white matter intensities in the posterior fossa the patient developed a coarse resting, postural and intention tremor, predominately involving the head. After primidone was ineffective and further compromised his level of alertness onabotulinum toxin was injected into the splenius capitus (25U) and sternocliedomastoid (75U) bilaterally. After one week there was a remarkable clinical improvement despite radiographically progressive disease.

Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan and Sakai, Osaka, Japan Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized mainly by pure cerebellar ataxia, especially in Japan. SCA8 is associated with an unstable CTA/CTG repeat expansion in an untranslated region of the ATXN8OS gene. Previous reports described that 80 or longer repeats were pathogenic. The pathogenicity of intermediate expansions in SCA8 remains controversial, though it has been reported in other triplet diseases, such as Huntington disease, another triplet repeat disease. Thus, we compared the clinical features of a patient with intermediate CTA/CTG repeats in SCA8 gene (intermediate-SCA8) to those in three patients with SCA8 with eighty or longer repeats (typical-SCA8) to clarify the pathogenic role of intermediate CTA/CTG repeats in SCA8. A patient with intermediate-SCA8 was a 76-year-old woman who started to have progressive cerebellar ataxia at age 75 years and was found to have 74 CTA/CTG repeats. Pyramidal tract sign and parkinsonism were not observed. We ruled out other major causes of cerebellar ataxia, including autoimmune-mediated ataxia. Cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI in a patient with intermediate-SCA8 was milder than that in three patients with typical-SCA8. The onset age 75 years was older than the oldest age 73 in reported patients with SCA8 and in our three patients with typical-SCA8. These findings might suggest that aging might help develop disease in patients with intermediate repeats. We speculated that intermediate CTA/CTG repeats in our patient might be pathogenic, because she was older than reported patients with typical-SCA8, and because other major causes were ruled out. Long-term and careful observations of the clinical course and the accumulation of further patients are needed to clarify the pathogenesis of intermediate CTA/CTG repeats in the ATXN8OS gene. Background: The asymmetry of motor symptoms at diagnosis is a hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). A prospective, randomized pilot clinical trial of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in early stage Parkinson's disease (PD) repeatedly evaluated motor symptoms after a seven-day therapeutic washout. This analysis reports changes in ipsilateral, contralateral, and axial motor symptom progression during this two year trial.",

Items 20 (upper and lower extremities), 21, and 23-26 were used to assess lateral (ipsilateral, contralateral) motor symptoms and items 18, 19, 20 (face) and 27-31 were used to assess axial motor symptoms. Ipsilateral and contralateral scores were totaled based on the initial side of motor symptom onset (same and opposite, respectively). Contralateral, ipsilateral, and axial scores between and within treatment groups (ODT n514, DBS1ODT n514) were compared from baseline to 24 months.",

            "text": "The objective of the current study was to assess the potential for saliva to serve as a biospecimen for biomarker identification in Huntington's disease (HD). Peripheral biomarkers are greatly needed in this field in order to anticipate onset of disease symptoms, monitor disease progression, and track potential therapeutic effects. HD is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the protein, huntingtin (Htt). The Htt protein is the most significant molecular target for disease modifying therapies, and several therapeutic approaches directed at its production, processing, and/or turnover are under development for impending clinical trials in HD. Since non-invasive methods to quantify Htt in the CNS do not exist, measuring Htt and other disease proteins in peripheral cells represents an essential step in biomarker discovery for HD. In the current study, we measured Htt protein in saliva from manifest HD patients, gene-positive premanifest HD patients, and age-and sex-matched normal individuals (total n5178) using ELISA methods. Stress and inflammation markers, including alpha-amylase, cortisol, Creactive protein (CRP), and uric acid, were also measured using similar methods. We found that total salivary Htt levels were significantly increased (p50.0012) in saliva from HD individuals (mean50.775 ng/ml) compared to normal controls (mean50.359 ng/ml). Total salivary Htt did not vary over time of day or over different days, nor were there age or gender effects. Salivary Htt showed significant correlations with several clinical measures, such as the total functional capacity (TFC; p50.040), motor score (p5 0.022) and the diagnostic confidence level (DCL; p50.029). In addition, salivary levels of mutant Htt protein, measured using different antibody combinations, were significantly higher in gene positive premanifest HD subjects compared to normal controls (p50.032). Of the stress/inflammation markers tested, CRP, a widely used biomarker of systemic inflammation, was found to be significantly (p50.025) elevated in premanifest HD subjects (9,548 pg/ml) compared to normal controls (3,399 pg/ml). CRP levels in saliva were also correlated with motor symptom scores (p50.022) among gene-positive patients. Levels of other markers, alpha amylase, cortisol and uric acid, were not significantly different between HD patients, premanifest subjects, or normal controls. We conclude that salivary Htt and possibly other inflammation markers, offer significant promise as relevant, non-invasive biomarkers of disease onset and progression in HD. Background: Gait disorders are common in patients with Parkinson's disease, frontal gait disorders associated with leukoariosis, or Alzheimer's disease. Episodic gait disorders, such as freezing, are particularly disabling and difficult to treat. The dorsomedial medulla forms a relay between forebrain, midbrain, cerebellar and spinal circuits that may mediate such episodic gait disorders. Indeed, in human post-mortem studies, this region contains pathological aggregates of tau and alpha-synuclein. In addition, loss of function of neurons in the dorsomedial medulla disrupts temporal patterns of gait in mice. In this study, we used temporally precise, selective optogenetic stimulation to investigate how activation of DMM neurons affects gait.",

In one cohort, injections were made in the midbrain and stimuli delivered in the dorsomedial medulla targeted axons in the terminal field. In the other, injections were made in the dorsomedial medulla, and light was delivered directly to transfected neurons. We placed EMG electrodes in both tibialis anterior muscles and the gastrocnemius ipsilaterally. This allowed us to deliver stimulation not only randomly but also at precise phases of the gait cycle. We captured ambulation with high frame-rate video. Each animal served as its own control. Gait parameters were extracted from video and EMG recordings and analyzed in Matlab.

After 17 years of disease she had a UPDRS cognitive score of 1 and some complaints of forgetfulness. She was on 250mg of l-dopa with significant dyskinesias. She passed away at age 72, and no autopsy was available. Her parents died at age 86 and 83, and there were eight siblings, but no family history of parkinsonism or dementia. Whole exome sequencing was performed as part of a study of parkinsonism in Afro-Caribbeans. The patient had a novel MAPT P512 variant in positionn 44071315, which causes a frameshift mutation in exon 8, and was not in the ExAC database. The second patient, a 65 year old Dominican woman, developed parkinsonism while on risperidal for depression, but parkinsonism persisted after withdrawal of medication and has responded to pramipexole and selegiline alone. Her mother is also followed in movement disorders for posturing of the right arm and dementia at age 90.

However, whether SWS serves as a marker of cognitive function in PD is unknown. We examined whether differences in SWS are associated with performance on a level II neurocognitive battery, as defined by the Movement Disorders Society Task Force on PD-mild cognitive impairment.",

The disparate results between subjective and objective measures of sleep and vigilance demonstrate the importance of objective outcomes in conjunction with selfreported measures in PD. This study demonstrates the significant influence of sleep on cognition and suggests that interventions to improve sleep might also improve cognitive function in individuals with PD. A prominent mechanism by which B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to be via antigen presentation to auto-reactive CD4 T cells. We previously demonstrated that B cells are sufficient to propagate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established model of MS, independently of any other antigen presenting cell (APC). To explore the timing of B cell access to antigen and presentation to encephalitogenic CD4 T cells during EAE, we used genetically engineered murine reagents allowing the expression of MHCII by B cells alone in a temporal fashion. Encephalitogenic CD4 T cells facilitate initiation of EAE by B cells independent of MHCII, as the onset of EAE is accelerated with longer intervals between transfer and cognate interactions with B cells. Rapid onset of EAE was associated with prominent B cell clusters distributed throughout the length of the spinal cord within the subarachnoid space. B cell clusters were associated with vascular VCAM expression within the subarachnoid space. B cells within the meninges exhibited features of germinal center B cells but without extensive proliferation. Gr-11 cell migration to the spinal cord meninges preceded B cell accumulation, and in vivo depletion of Gr-11 cells eased the accelerated onset of EAE. Our results demonstrate that B cells are capable of rapidly accumulating within the meninges while promoting neuroinflammation during EAE. However, B cell migration to the CNS is coordinated by Gr-11 cells via signals from CD4 T cells independent of cognate interactions with B cells.",

Background: Tumefactive demyelination describes a solitary (>2cm) intracranial space occupying lesion that may mimic a neoplasm clinically and radiographically due to contrast enhancement, mass effect, and edema. Patients may present with symptoms atypical for MS such as seizures, aphasia or cognitive dysfunction. Tumefactive lesions are common in Marburg variant, but are an uncommon manifestation of MS ($1 per 1000 cases).

Carlsbad, CA and Madison, WI Alexander disease is a fatal leukodystrophy caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in astrocytes of the central nervous system. A key feature of pathogenesis is over-expression and accumulation of GFAP, with formation of characteristic cytoplasmic aggregates known as Rosenthal fibers. We have used mouse models with knock-in mutations corresponding to known human GFAP mutations to explore the utility of antisense suppression of GFAP expression as a therapeutic strategy for this disorder. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target various regions of the murine Gfap transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP. Nearly complete and long-lasting elimination of GFAP occurred following single bolus intracerebroventricular injections, with reversal of Rosenthal fibers and downstream markers of microglial and other stress responses. Antisense suppression therefore shows great promise as a therapeutic approach for Alexander disease.",

IF led to changes in the gut microbiome increasing bacterial richness. IF had direct effects on the composition of T cells in the gut lamina propria with a reduction of IL17 producing T cells and an increase in the number of regulatory T cells which could possible modulate systemic immune responses. Importantly, fecal microbiome transplantation from mice on IF was able to ameliorate EAE in immunized recipient mice, suggesting that IF immunomodulatory effects are at least partially mediated by the gut flora. We translated our findings in MS patients in a pilot clinical trial in MS patients having a relapse to test safety, feasibility and effects of IF on clinical and laboratory measures. We observed potentially beneficial effects on levels of several immune inflammatory parameters as well as gut flora that resembled the protective changes observed in mice in EAE.",

Eligibility criteria were adults, a neurologist confirmed MS diagnosis, at least one Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and at least one International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 code other than MS during study period. All ICD-9 codes were mapped to previously developed phenotype codes (i.e., comorbidities), allowing consolidation of multiple ICD-9 codes related to one condition. The MS Severity Scores (MSSS) were calculated using EDSS scores measured at each clinic visit and the corresponding disease duration. MS severity, modeled as a continuous variable, was assessed as the median MSSS based on the three most recent scores. The primary outcome was the presence of each comorbidity. We tested the association between the MSSS and each comorbidity using logistic regression and adjusting for sex, age and disease course at symptom onset and follow-up duration.",

Four patients were followed up after hypoxicanoxic coma (Glasgow Coma Scale of < 5). Daily neuro-ophthalmological examinations (specific attention to pupils, spontaneous and reflex eye movements) were conducted. CT and EEGs were performed; the tendon response was exaggerated and all patients remained comatose with no sign of arousal elicited. EEG responses indicated moderate to severe encephalopathy of non-specific etiology while CT appeared normal with no evidence of acute damage. However, the pattern of ocular deviations did not follow any particular pattern; we noticed that the appearance of vertical eye deviation was associated with poor prognosis.

This case demonstrates that despite a protracted course of vasospasm, a good functional outcome can be achieved if interventions are applied within a timely manner. More careful monitoring and preventative measures may avoid extensive interventional stenting and angioplasty in FMD. This case provides an extraordinary situation where post SAH vasospasm can occur unexpectedly outside of the expected therapeutic window. There continues to be a clinical gap in understanding the clinical variability of post SAH vasospasm complications. A better understanding of cranial vasospasm in FMD needs to be addressed both at the basic science and clinical stages. The discrepancy between the highly complicated clinical course of our patient and her favorable functional outcomes is likely explained by joint efforts in the neurointensive care setting with round the clock neurointerventional expertise available. Although this is an ideal clinical model with favorable outcomes, there are limited number of hospitals in the United States that can provide this optimized setting.

However, it is unclear how such a wide spectrum of gene mutation leads to similar pathologies in patients. We hypothesize that the protein products of mutated genes will not be able to maintain proper interactions with their binding partners, and thus the cellular events they take part in will be affected, and it is indeed these impaired cellular functions, and not single gene mutations, that are responsible for initiating neuronal vulnerability. In an effort to understand why upper and/or lower motor neuron populations display primary vulnerability in different motor neuron diseases, we first identified binding partners of the protein products of all mutated genes that are either associated or linked with ALS, HSP/PLS and SMA. The protein interactome map for each of these diseases had unique and shared proteins. We then studied the canonical pathways and protein networks that are common and unique among diseases that primarily affect distinct motor neuron populations. Our studies reveal that upper and lower motor neurons have their favorite cellular canonical pathways that are distinct and they share some in common. Protein interaction networks also suggest key cellular events and how they may be affected with the mutations of key proteins. At times these proteins hold interactome maps together and are the key interactors linking numerous cellular events. Therefore, their lack of function would be detrimental for numerous cellular events, and that in part explains why their mutations may lead to motor neuron vulnerability and degeneration. Our studies, which originate from human mutations, suggest presence of key cellular events that are primarily important for distinct motor neurons and implicate how their imbalance or perturbation may tip the balance towards selective vulnerability. Ongoing immunocytochemical analysis using post-mortem human motor cortex as well as Elisa assays using serum and plasma samples isolated from ALS patients, further confirm relevance and importance of protein interaction network analysis and how this imbalance lead to motor neuron vulnerability and degeneration. Our results also begin to suggest novel targets for cellular therapies, especially for upper motor neurons.",

For many neuropathies and traumatic nerve injuries, permanent axonal degeneration might only be reversed through new regenerative strategies. Here we summarize work identifying three pathways from tumor biology that alter the intrinsic regenerative behaviour of adult sensory neurons. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) is expressed in adult sensory neurons, particularly small IB4 nonpeptidergic neurons that have attenuated growth properties. As a tumor suppressor, PTEN inhibits the growth factor pathways that operate through PI3K-pAkt. Small molecule inhibition or local siRNA knockdown of PTEN ramps up the regenerative growth of sensory neurons of in vitro and in vivo injury models (Christie et al, J Neurosc 2010). PTEN expression is paradoxically increased in experimental diabetic neuropathy where regeneration is compromised (Singh et al, Brain, 2014) . Retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1) is expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of adult sensory neurons. Knockdown of Rb1 by siRNA increased the outgrowth and branching of adult sensory neurons in vitro, in collaboration with PPAR\u00c7 and E2F1. Local Rb1 siRNA knockdown improved outgrowth of axons beyond a nerve transection and indices of regeneration following nerve crush (Christie et al, 2014) . APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) is mutated in colon carcinomas and suppresses tumor growth by acting as a component of the b-catenin destruction complex. b-catenin is a growth promoting transcription factor. APC forms a structural scaffold to phosphorylate b-catenin to be degraded by the proteasome. APC is also particularly (but not exclusively) expressed in IB4 nonpeptidergic neurons, has a reciprocal relationship with b-catenin expression and is paradoxically upregulated by injury. APC knockdown by siRNA improves sensory neurite outgrowth in vitro and regeneration beyond a crush site in vivo (Duraikannu, submitted) .",

            "text": "[ Peripheral axonal polyneuropathy is a common, potentially dose-limiting side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents despite disparate mechanisms of action, suggesting that the axon destructive properties of various chemotherapies converge on a common axonal degeneration (AxD) program. Components of such a putative program had until recently been largely unknown, until others and we discovered that genetic deletion of SARM1 dramatically protects axons from degeneration after axotomy and prevents neuropathy induced by the commonly used chemotherapeutic agent vincristine in a mouse model. It remains unknown, however, whether the same upstream regulators and downstream effectors of SARM1 act in vincristine-induced axon degeneration and axotomy, and whether the protective effects of SARM1 deletion are also realized by chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action. To address these questions, we used cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and two chemotherapeutic agents, vincristine and bortezomib (BTZ). Vincristine acts by stabilizing tubulin polymerization and interfering with intracellular trafficking, whereas BTZ inhibits the proteasome. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of SARM1 strongly decreases not only vincristine-induced neurite degeneration, but also axonal destruction following administration of BTZ. In axotomy, SARM1 is activated by a loss of NMNAT and acts through catastrophic decrease of NAD1. As in axotomy, neurite degeneration after vincristine and BTZ is preceded by loss of NAD1. Maintaining NAD1 levels by overexpressing nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK) and supplementation with NR strongly protect from both vincristine and BTZinduced degeneration. Furthermore, as in axotomy, overexpressing cytosolic NMNAT1 in the axon prevents degeneration following both vincristine and BTZ. However, while targeting with pharmacological inhibitors the same MAPkinase pathway that regulates SARM1 in axotomy protects from vincristine-induced AxD, it does not decrease BTZinduced AxD. BTZ induced degeneration instead is transcriptionally regulated and can be blocked by over-expressing the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-XL. These findings indicate that different upstream pathways converge on a core axonal degeneration program which consists of NMNAT, SARM1 and NAD1 and which mediates both acute and chronic axonal degeneration. Excitingly, we are able to inhibit this program and, thus pathological AxD in vitro, by virus mediated expression of a SARM1-dominant/ negative mutant. We suggest that targeting the core axonal degeneration pathway either by directly inhibiting SARM1 or maintaining NAD1 through supplementation may have great therapeutic value in the prevention of multiple variants of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and possibly other peripheral polyneuropathies.

Sheth, Patrick L. Heilman, Stephen J. Kolb and W. David Arnold. Columbus, OH Background: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a common occurrence, accounting for 2-3% of patients presenting to trauma centers. Weakness from damage to motor axons and incomplete reinnervation is a major source of morbidity. Strategies to improve recovery include accelerating axonal regrowth and optimizing neuromuscular junction (NMJ) reinnervation. Adult transgenic mice with SMN depletion exhibit normal axonal regrowth after PNI, but reinnervation of the NMJ is diminished. We have developed an AAV9 vector to overexpress SMN, which has been used previously to rescue animal models of spinal muscular atrophy. We developed and refined a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological assays to monitor motor unit connectivity in vivo.",

Mutations in SOD1 are responsible for 20% of familial ALS. Given the likely gain of toxic function in this dominantly inherited disease, lowering SOD1 mRNA and protein is predicted to provide therapeutic benefit. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting SOD1 have been developed and tested in Phase I human clinical trial, yet these early ASO efforts in the CNS afforded modest protection in animal models and did not test whether ASOs may reverse disease once started. We developed next generation SOD1 ASOs that more potently reduce SOD1 mRNA and protein and extend survival by more 50 days in SOD1G93A rats by more than 45 days in SOD1G93A mouse. Even more striking, we demonstrated that the initial loss of compound muscle action potential in SOD1G93A mice is reversed after a single dose of SOD1 ASO. Furthermore, increases in serum phospho-neurofilament heavy levels, a promising biomarker for ALS, are reversed by SOD1 ASO therapy. These results define a highly potent, new SOD1 ASO ready for human clinical trial and suggest that at least some components of muscle denervation and dysfunction can be reversed by therapy.",

Because this disease predominantly affects MNs, we aimed to characterize the distinct expression profile of that cell type in order to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms and identify novel targets that inform on MN health during ALS disease timecourse. microRNAs (miR-NAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that can shape the expression profile of a cell and, consequently, often exhibit cell type enriched expression. To determine MN-enriched miRNA expression, we utilized Cre recombinase-dependent miRNA tagging and affinity purification in mice. By defining the in vivo miRNA expression of MNs, all neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, we then focused on MN-enriched miRNAs via a comparative analysis, and found they may functionally distinguish MNs postnatally from other spinal neurons. Characterizing the levels of the MN-enriched miR-NAs in CSF harvested from ALS models of MN disease demonstrated that one miRNA (miR-218) tracked with MN loss and was responsive to an ALS therapy in rodent models. Thus, we have employed cellular expression profiling tools to define the distinct miRNA expression of MNs, which is likely to enrich future studies of MN disease. This approach enabled development of a novel, drug-responsive marker of MN disease in ALS rodents.",

Bethesda, MD Myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) are rare heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders characterized by aggregation of degraded myofibrillar products in skeletal muscle. At least 6 genes including LDB3/ZASP, MYOT, DES, BAG3, CRYAB and FLNC have been identified to underlie pathology in multiple international cohorts. However, a large majority of patients with MFM still do not have a genetic diagnosis. Distal muscle weakness is often more prominent than proximal weakness. Cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure can be life-threatening. Extramuscular manifestations include axonal neuropathy, deafness, diarrhea, dysphonia and cataracts, which are increasingly recognized in MFM patients. These non-muscle manifestations of MFM remain more difficult to explain in part because the expression of the MFM gene products is largely unknown in the nervous system. We demonstrate, for the first time, the expression of ZASP, Myotillin, Filamin C, and BAG3 in ChAT-positive neurons of the spinal cord in mice and humans. In contrast, we find Desmin and aB-Crystallin in glial cells under non-pathological conditions, as demonstrated previously. We show that BAG3 is expressed in motor axons ending in neuromuscular junctions, while Desmin, aB-Crystallin, BAG3, Filamin C, and Myotilin localize to the postsynaptic membranes of the neuromuscular junctions in the tibilais anterior muscle of wildtype mice. ZASP mRNA is extensively alternatively spliced in a developmental-stage and tissue-dependent manner in striated muscle. We identified distinct ZASP splice variants in the mouse brain by Single Molecule Real Time sequencing of transcripts. Exon utilization may explain distinct phenotypes seen in MFM due to ZASP mutations. The presence of different MFM gene products in lower motor neurons, terminal motor axons and neuromuscular junctions can explain non-muscle manifestations in MFM. We propose that the MFM genes should be included in the next generation diagnostic panels for the Charcot Marie Tooth diseases, motor neuronopathies, myasthenic syndromes and other lower motor unit disorders.",

Veterans in our ALS cohort were over five times as likely to have possible FTLD, cognitive type. Unlike other ALS patients, Veterans with ALS were much less likely to score normally on the ALS CBS cognitive subscale. In addition, triple the percentage of Veterans with ALS met criteria for possible FTLD, behavioral type. Taken together, these data suggest that Veterans with ALS have more severe cognitive impairment than their civilian counterparts. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a progressive, multisystemic, autosomal dominant genetic disease. Neuroimaging studies have discovered significant disruptions in white matter structure in the brains of individuals with DM1. In addition, patients and family members often report that the most disabling symptoms of DM1 involve cognitive and behavioral changes related to the Central Nervous System (CNS). Despite this, little is known about actual disease progression within the CNS in DM1. As clinical drug trials have already started in DM1, it will be crucial to identify biomarkers of disease progression within the CNS. Using a combination of structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and neuropsychological assessment, we examined brain structure and function in a group of 30 individuals with adult-onset DM1 and 26 healthy controls (males and females, ages 18-64). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to control for the effects of age and gender for group comparisons. In order to study disease progression we also examined the relationship of disease duration (as measured by years since onset of symptoms) to brain structure and function measures using linear regression analyses. It was found that patients with DM1 showed reduced volumes of both global (intracranial volume, white matter volume) and regional brain measures (thalamus, putamen). A similar analysis of DTI measures (fractional anisotropy; FA) revealed a significant, diffuse reduction in white matter structural integrity in the patients with DM1. Neuropsychological outcomes showed deficits in visuospatial skills, working memory, and processing speed for the individuals with DM1 (even after controlling for education level). When looking at disease progression within the DM1 group, disease duration (DD) was highly predictive of whole brain FA (r 5 -.713, p <.001) even after controlling for age and gender effects. Those who have experienced the disease the longest showed the most severely disrupted white matter (regardless of age). A similar pattern was found for volumes of the thalamus (r 5 -.496, p 5 .010), scores on the perceptual reasoning index (r 5 -.658, p <.001), and the processing speed index (r 5 -.455, p 5 .017). Results point to a progressive, measurable deterioration of brain structure and function, particularly within the white matter and thalamus. These neuroimaging measures may provide valuable biomarkers of disease progression within the CNS for DM1. Expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleatide repat of the C9orf72 gene is the most common known genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). An attractive hypothesis is that aberrant microglia might lead to neuronal loss or synaptic disruption in neurodegenerative disorders like ALS and FTD. Although recent work from our lab demonstrated that C9orf72 is required for proper macrophage and microglial function in mice, there was no appreciable neuronal death and the mechanism by which neuronal cells are eventually loss in ALS remains unknown. In order to study neuronal death in C9orf72 mice, the known and reliable MPTP model of neuronal degeneration is being utilized. Wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous C9orf72 mice were injected with lower doses of MPTP than typically used in Parkinson's models to avoid complete ablation of dopaminergic neurons. Although the preliminary data has not demonstrated a quantifiable increase in neuronal death in the mutant animals compared to controls at the tested dose, the MPTP treated C9orf72 mutants appear to develop an increase in reactive astrocytosis in areas of neuronal loss. Ongoing analyses will focus in studying older animals and further characterizing the extent of neuronal injury and the inflammatory responsea involved, including microglia. Such studies should help in understanding the link between the C9orf72 gene, microglial dysfunction, and the eventual neuronal degeneration observed in ALS.",

Baltimore, MD It is not clear if the regeneration of sensory distal axons is length-dependent. Additionally, regeneration of cutaneous unmyelinated axons is known to be slowed in DM-patients and after 3-months and the density of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF) does not return to baseline levels after chemical or mechanical axotomy. However, the long-term outcome of regeneration in DM or control subjects is not known. Here we measured the rate of axonal regeneration 6-months after chemical denervation using a capsaicin model in DM patients (n511/37 DM1/DM2) without neuropathy, and 5 controls. DM skin punches were performed at distal thigh at baseline, 48-hours post-capsaicin, and at 28, 90, 150 and 180 days. Blood glucose and HgbA1C were measured at baseline, 90, 150 and 180 days. Healthy controls had skin punches at both distal leg and proximal thigh at baseline, after capsaicin chemical axotomy, and days 28, 60, 90 and 180. Regeneration rate was significantly higher at the thigh in healthy controls (0.1 fibers/mm/day (95% CI: 0.04-0.18 fibers/mm/day) compared to DM (p50.043), but no difference between DM1 (0.07 fibers/ mm/day 95% CI: 0.01-0.13 fibers/mm/day) or DM2 (0.06 fibers/mm/day 95% CI: 0.01-0.12 fibers/mm/day) (p50.4). Comparing regeneration rate at different time intervals, showed that regeneration was significantly slowed between day 150 and 180 DM patients, while it continued with the same rate in controls. Blood glucose or HgA1C had no effect on regeneration rate. IENFD returned to baseline in controls by 6-months (118% of baseline) while it is did not in DM subjects, 76%/58% (DM1/DM2) of IENFD baseline, (p50.003 DM vs. controls). There was no difference in regeneration rate IENFD %-baseline by 6-months at distal leg and proximal thigh in controls (p50.61). These results suggest that the rate and outcome of regeneration is independent of the length of the axon. Additionally diabetic patient have incomplete nerve regeneration after 6 months regardless of diabetes type or the level of glycemic control. Regeneration of axons slowed down over time in patients with DM and reached a plateau after 150 days. Objective: Autosomal recessive mutations in TBCK cause intellectual disability of variable severity. Although the physiologic function of TBCK remains unclear, loss-of-function mutations are associated with inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. As mTORC1 signaling is known to regulate autophagy, we hypothesized that TBCK-encephalopathy patients with a neurodegenerative course have defects in autophagiclysosomal dysfunction.",

Overall, non-parametric methods were sensitive for identifying circadian abnormalities in this cognitively-normal population; cosinor, periodogram, and EMD analyses were highly correlated to each other, but could not detect any changes in preclinical AD.",

Introduction: Daytime napping is very common in older adults, especially in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Preliminary evidence suggests that self-reported napping or excessive daytime sleepiness might also precede the risk of PD. However, no study has prospectively examined whether objectively-measured napping could predict the long-term risk of developing PD in community-dwelling older adults.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Longer daytime napping was prospectively associated with a higher risk of developing PD in older men. Identification of excessive napping in the elderly might help to predict future PD risk. Further studies are needed to help understand potential mechanisms. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder in aging that is associated with cognitive decline, including significant executive dysfunction, for which the neurobiological underpinnings remain poorly understood. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS), this study sought to assess whether dysregulations of the homeostatic balance of the major inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter systems of c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, respectively, play a role in SDB. Levels of GABA and those of the combined resonances of glutamate and glutamine (Glx), were measured by 1H MRS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC) and bilateral hippocampal regions of nineteen older adults (age 6 SD: 66.1 61.9 years; 64.3% female) with moderate to severe SDB, defined as having Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) greater than fifteen as assessed by polysomnography, and in fourteen older adults (age 6 SD: 62.3 61.3 years; 31.6% female) without SDB (AHI<5). In subjects with SDB, levels of left l-DLPFC GABA, but not Glx, were significantly lower than in control subjects (p < 0.0002). In addition, there was a negative correlation between left l-DLPFC GABA levels, but not Glx, and SDB severity by AHI (r5-0.68, p<0.0001), and a positive correlation between left l-DLPFC GABA levels, but not Glx, and minimal oxygen saturation during sleep (r50.62, p50.0005). By contrast, no group differences or associations with AHI or oxygen saturation were found for levels of GABA, Glx or any other metabolite in either right or left hippocampal region. Furthermore, GABA levels in l-DLPFC correlated positively with DLPFC cortical thickness (r50.41, p50.03). These findings suggest and are interpreted in terms of a pathophysiological model of SDB in which hypoxia-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission deficit in the DLPFC leads to hyperexcitability and, potentially to neuronal dysfunction and attendant cognitive decline in SDB. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes whose products form a critical inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Loss of TSC1/2 gene function renders an mTOR-overactivated state. Clinically, TSC manifests with epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and sleep dysfunction. We report that mouse models of TSC have abnormal circadian rhythms. We show that mTOR regulates the proteostasis of the core clock protein BMAL1, affecting its translation, degradation, and subcellular localization. This results in elevated levels of BMAL1 and a dysfunctional clock that displays abnormal timekeeping in constant conditions and exaggerated responses to phase resetting. Remarkably, genetically lowering the dose of BMAL1 rescues circadian behavioral phenotypes in TSC mouse models. These findings indicate that BMAL1 deregulation is a feature of the mTOR-activated state and suggest a molecular mechanism for mitigating circadian phenotypes in a neurodevelopmental disorder. JZP-110 is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with wake-promoting effects. Adults with narcolepsy type 1/2 were randomized to receive placebo (n560), JZP-110 75mg (n559), 150mg (n560), or 300mg (n560) daily for 12 weeks. Change from baseline to week 12 in Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were co-primary endpoints; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) was a key secondary endpoint. Safety was also evaluated. Patients were 65.3% female, 80.1% white, mean6SD age 36.2 6 13.2 years. Least squares mean MWT change from baseline at week 12 was 9.8 and 12.3 minutes with JZP-110 150mg and 300mg, respectively, relative to 2.1 minutes with placebo (both P<0.0001); 75mg was not significant on the MWT. All JZP-110 doses significantly decreased ESS scores and increased patient ratings of improvement on the PGI-C relative to placebo at 12 weeks (75mg, P<0.05; 150mg and 300mg, P<0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events !5% across JZP-110 groups were headache, nausea, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, dry mouth, and anxiety. JZP-110 150mg and 300mg met the co-primary efficacy endpoints; safety was consistent with phase 2 trials. Support: Jazz Pharmaceuticals.

We suggest that observation is an appropriate first approach in the absence of underlying hypercoagulable states. Anticoagulation is not inherently required, and may actually be detrimental in some cases, as outcomes in pediatric cases of head trauma are generally good. Additional clinical data are needed to define specific indications for antithrombotic therapy in children with traumatic CVST. Often thought to represent gliosis, the underlying microstructural tissue and microvascular integrity within FLAIR hyperintensities are not well understood. The current study utilized a multimodal MRI protocol to assess mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and vascular function within FLAIR abnormal regions in chronic TBI subjects. MRI was performed on chronic TBI subjects (subjects with FLAIR abnormalities, n513; subjects without FLAIR abnormalities, n58) and healthy controls (n515). Multimodal MRI included T1-MPRAGE, FLAIR, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), and Blood-oxygen level dependent imaging (BOLD) with hypercapnia challenge to assess cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR). MD, FA, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and CVR within regions of FLAIR hyperintensities were compared to normal appearing tissue. All values were converted to z-scores using the pool of healthy controls from the study. There was a significant reduction in FA, CBF, and CVR with a complementary increase in MD within regions of FLAIR abnormalities (p<0.05). TBI subjects demonstrated regions of increased MD and reduced CVR in regions of normal appearing brain parenchyma (p<0.05, compared to controls). A standardized symptoms questionnaire (RPQ-13) did not reveal differences between TBI subjects with FLAIR hyperintensities versus TBI subjects without FLAIR abnormalities (p > 0.05), consistent with prior studies indicating that FLAIR-hyperintense abnormalities do not predict clinical outcome. Grey matter CVR correlated weakly with RPQ-13 symptom score (r 5 0.457, p 5 0.018), as did global MD (r 5 20.407, p 5 0.033). These findings provide insight into the neurobiology underlying FLAIR abnormal regions in individuals with chronic TBI, and indicate that DTI metrics and measures of microvascular integrity may be more sensitive measures of chronic pathology after TBI.",

Interhemispheric interactions between the two primary motor cortices are of principal importance in understanding functional lateralization, bimanual coordination, and recovery after hemiparesis.

Our findings demonstrate a mechanism that may underly age-related impairments in bimanual coordination. Postmortem neuropathological examination of hemispheric lateralization of pathology in bvFTD is understudied, despite numerous neuroimaging studies showing asymmetric disease. Here we measured the severity of postmortem grey (GM) and white matter (WM) pathology using a validated digital image analysis method in four cortical regions sampled from each hemisphere in 24 bvFTD patients (FTLD-tau59, FTLD-TDP514 or FTLD-FUS51). We calculated an asymmetry index (AI) based on the difference in measured pathology from each left-right sample pair. Analysis of the absolute value of AI (i.e. degree of lateralization independent of direction) revealed highly lateralized pathology for both GM and WM in all four regions (p<0.01). Direct inter-hemispheric comparisons found higher pathology in the right orbitofrontal region compared to the left for grey matter in FTLD-Tau and for white matter in FTLD-TDP (p<0.02). We also found increased pathology in the left ventrolateral temporal lobe GM compared to the right hemisphere in the total cohort (p<0.02). Exploratory analysis using antemortem clinical and imaging data correlated with our histology data. We conclude that pathologic disease burden is not distributed symmetrically in bvFTD, and this asymmetry of disease burden contributes to the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder. Background:Neonatal seizures are common and majority are due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy(HIE). Tissue clearing, transgenic mice, and advanced microscopy allow neuronal activity. Circuitry in acute HIE seizures is unknown and may shed light on relation between seizures and later behavioral deficits. Objective:Examine neuronal activity and evolution following acute HIE seizures in a neonatal mouse using tissue clearing/microscopy. Methods:Postnatal day(p)9 mice are implanted with electrodes. p10 HIE is created using unilateral carotid ligation145min hypoxia in Cre-tamoxifen transgenic mice (TRAP). 4-hydroxytamoxifen injection allows expression of fluorescent protein in active neurons. EEG is performed. Shams receive inci-sion1anesthesia only. p17 mice are processed using lipidclearing. Multiphoton imaging and Zeiss software is utilized to obtain/process images. Results: 100%(n512) exhibit seizures and burst suppression. Tissue clearing/microscopy allowed visualization of active neurons during seizures. HI mice exhibit selective neuronal activation in the dentate granule cells and CA3 compared to sham. Conclusion:Tissue clarification/advanced microscopy is feasible to examine neuronal activity during seizures in this model. Neuronal activity is present in the bilateral cortex, dentate and CA3 after HI-seizures. Ongoing work delineates seizure evolution and correlate EEG with neuronal activity in this model. Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene cause Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by language impairment, intellectual disability, stereotyped movements, and autism spectrum behavior. Early studies into MeCP2 function demonstrated that it is enriched in neurons, interacts with methylated DNA, and represses gene expression. However, subsequent studies paint a more complex picture because MeCP2 is bound diffusely across the genome without obvious gene targets to mediate the neurological phenotypes. We recently gained insight into this problem through a meta-analysis of gene expression studies from MeCP2-mutant mice and found that MeCP2 preferentially regulates very long, highly methylated genes. Because DNA methylation patterns are cell type-specific, we hypothesized that MeCP2 regulated genes are also likely to be dependent on cell type. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the MeCP2dependent transcriptional programs across each brain cell type in mouse and human. These data suggest that cell type-specific DNA methylation patterns largely determine the extent of gene regulation by MeCP2 within in an individual cell type. Together, these findings provide new insight into the complexity of transcriptional misregulation that occurs across multiple cell types in Rett syndrome.",

Nashville, TN Parkinson disease (PD) patients are frequently prescribed D2-like dopamine agonist (DAgonist) therapy for motor symptoms, yet a proportion develop clinically significant behavioral addictions characterized by impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs). We identified 35 PD patients receiving DAgonist therapy, with (n517) and without (n518) ICBs, matched for age, disease duration, severity, and dopamine therapy. In the off-dopamine state, all completed [18F]fallypride PET imaging, a high affinity D2-like receptor ligand that can measure striatal and extrastriatal D2/3 binding potential. Striatal differences between ICB1/ ICB-patients localized to the ventral striatum and putamen, where ICB1 subjects had reduced nondisplaced binding potential (BPND). Self-reported severity of ICB symptoms positively correlate with midbrain D2/3 receptor binding potential. Group differences in regional D2/3 binding potential relationships were also notable: ICB1 (but not ICB-) patients expressed positive correlations between midbrain and caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and amygdala. Compulsive behaviors seen in PD are associated with reduced ventral more than dorsal striatal D2/3 expression, similar to changes in comparable behavioral disorders. Preserved ventral midbrain dopaminergic projections throughout nigrostriatal and mesolimbic networks are unique to PD-ICB patients, and may account for differential DAgonist response.

Patsos, Richard J. Traystman and Paco S. Herson. Aurora, CO Cardiac arrest (CA) or stroke in children often leads to poor neurologic outcomes in children, including learning and memory deficits. Children often have improved outcomes compared to adults. An increase in synaptic efficiency, termed long-term potentiation (LTP), is a well-accepted cellular model for learning and memory. We have shown persistent impairment of synaptic function following CA and middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult mice. Juvenile mice (postnatal day 20-25) were subjected to 8 min CA and resuscitated or had transient occlusion of the MCA. Hippocampal CA1 synaptic plasticity was evaluated using brain slices 7 or 30 days after CA/MCAO or sham controls. In control male mice, LTP was 153% (n58) of baseline (100%). In contrast, 7 days after CA, there was significant impairment, in LTP. By 30 days after CA, LTP recovered to control levels. Following MCAO, there was impairment in the ipsilateral, but not contralateral hippocampus. Similar to CA, by 30 days after MCAO, both ipsilateral and contralateral LTP had recovered LTP. This seminal discovery of endogenous recovery of LTP through development into adulthood may contribute to improved neurological outcome in children compared to adults. Exceptional neurological recoveries of post-cardiac arrest patients who otherwise expected to have uniformly unfavorable outcomes argue for presently unknown variables that may affect probabilities of neuronal survival. In search for such variables, we characterize three post-cardiac arrest patients who recovered despite remaining in coma beyond time-frames traditionally considered compatible with favorable outcome. All three patients initially had preserved pupillary, but absent corneal and motor reflexes. Importantly, all patients had prolonged burst-suppression pattern (BSP) on EEG (until days 37, 9 and 15, respectively), considered a very strong negative predictor of outcome. Neurological recovery was delayed, but progressive across the group: return of eye opening (days 17-37), motor responses (days 30-50) and command following (days 45-71), all achieved near full recovery. Based on recent modeling studies, BSP may promote cellular preservation via stabilization of membrane potentials in low energy states with each burst representing an attempt to recover circuit dynamics. Considering the current practice of early prognostic decisions in these patients, these observations call for further investigation into the physiological significance of BSP in the setting of post-anoxic brain injury. Peripheral polyneuropathy is a common side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that the axon destructive properties of various chemotherapies converge on a common axonal degeneration (AxD) program. Components of this program had been largely unknown, until others and we recently discovered that SARM1-/-dramatically protects axons from degeneration after axotomy and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine in a mouse model. It remains unknown whether a) SARM1-/-protects from AxD when using chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action and b) whether SARM1 acts through the same pathway in neuropathy as in axotomy. Using the chemotherapeutics vincristine (decreases intracellular trafficking) and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in cultured neurons, we demonstrate that SARM1-/-inhibits both vincristine and bortezomib-induced neurite degeneration. As in axotomy, maintaining NAD1 by overexpression of NMNAT1 protects from chemotherapy-induced degeneration. While targeting the MAP-kinase pathway that regulates SARM1 in axotomy protects from vincristine-induced AxD, it does not decrease bortezomib-induced AxD. These findings indicate that different pathways converge on a core AxD program consisting of NMNAT, SARM1 and NAD1. We suggest that targeting this pathway may have great therapeutic value for different chemotherapy-induced neuropathies.",

Houston, TX and Minneapolis, MN Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is characterized by adult-onset cerebellar degeneration with attendant loss of motor coordination; bulbar function is eventually impaired, and patients tend to die from inability to clear the airway. We asked whether motor neuron degeneration is at the root of this dysfunction and dissected disease progression in an SCA1 mouse model. Specifically, we assessed breathing physiology, diaphragm histology and electromyography, and spinal cord and brainstem motor neuron histology and immunohistochemistry. SCA1 mice show progressive neuromuscular respiratory abnormalities, neurogenic changes in diaphragm, and motor neuron degeneration in the spinal cord and brainstem. The latter is accompanied by reactive astrocytosis and accumulation of Atxn1 aggregates in the motor neuron nuclei. These findings confirm this mouse line as an SCA1 model with face and construct validity for this understudied disease feature. Furthermore, this model is suitable to study the pathogenic mechanism driving motor neuron degeneration in SCA1 and perhaps other degenerative motor neuron diseases. From a clinical standpoint, the data indicate that pulmonary function testing and employment of non-invasive ventilator support could be beneficial in SCA1 patients. Objective: Antiphospholipid-associated myelitis has been postulated to cause longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is the commonest cause of LETM and discovery of its highly specific (>99%) serum biomarker, aquaporin-4-IgG, in 2004 allowed it be distinguished from other diseases. We sought to assess the frequency of aquaporin-4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD and other diagnoses in LETM with antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies.",

Saint Louis, MO and Philadelphia, PA Introduction: Inflammation is present in HIV infected (HIV1) individuals immediately following seroconversion and in the virologically suppressed. Elevated inflammation is not always indicative of cognitive decline but can relate to anatomical damage. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics are significantly confounded by the presence of inflammation losing its sensitivity and specificity to brain pathologies. Utilizing Diffusion basis spectral imaging (DBSI) we will examine restricted diffusion patterns associated with cellularity and neuroinflammation, in a cohort of virally suppressed and medically stable HIV1 patients. Methods: Ninety-two HIV1 patients on highly active anti-retroviral therapy and 66 HIV uninfected (HIV-) controls underwent neuropsychological testing, and neuroimaging. Cognition was assessed utilizing standardized T-scores on the domains of memory, psychomotor speed, and executive functioning. Tract based spatial statistics was utilized and comparisons between cohorts were conduced for both DTI and DBSI metrics. An ANCOVA was perform across the age spectrum on skeletal averages of cellularity and HIV status stratified for gender. Within the HIV1 cohort, cellularity was evaluated for CD4 recovery and correlations were performed (nadir CD4 <250 and current CD4 >500; CR). Results: There were no significant differences in cognition between the two groups. Voxel-wise analysis revealed fractional anisotropy as defined by DTI was lower in aviremic HIV1 compared to HIV-(p<0.05 corrected) but no differences were observed between groups for FA when estimated with DBSI. However, diffuse increases for cellularity were observed in HIV1 individuals compared to HIV-controls (p<0.05 corrected). Age was inversely associated with cellularity in HIV1 participants (p50.003, r5-0.31) but not controls. Significant differences in cellularity were only observed for the voung CR group (< 50) compared to either the older non-CR (> 50; p<0.001) or older CR group (p50.001). Conclusions: This data shows that DBSI is more sensitive at detecting alternate etiologies that are beyond the limitations of DTI. Elevated levels of cellularity were diffusely observed in aviremic HIV1 patients and persist in lieu of cognitive impairment. The biological correlate of cellularity is unknown, however elevated levels of cellularity were seen in younger individuals with CR, implying an active immune response. This is one of the first non-invasive approaches at quantifying low-level neuroinflammation in virologically suppressed HIV individuals without cognitive impairment. Objective: To report a patient with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)-associated granulomatous disease with neurological complications including cervical dystonia with tremor and optic neuropathy.",

Possibly, because of a preexisting mild deficit in this region, she may has been more susceptible to such changes. Alternatively, nasal mucosal engorgement may have been effected, reducing air flow to the olfactory epithelium, and thus smell. The mucosal lining of the nasal epithelium may have been altered, reducing ability of odors to dissolve and thus perceived smell. The taste deficit may have been a retronasal smell deficit, which is a result of synesthesia, misperceived as a taste loss. Why vortioxetine did not have similar effect is unclear. However, it has multimodal serotonergic actions including a 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 antagonist, a 5-HT1A agonist, and a 5-HT1B partial agonist property. Possibly these bypass the olfactory pathway and thus the smell is not effected. In those with depression and olfactory deficits, it may be prudent to initiate therapy with vortioxetine.

By contrast, conditions which promoted B-cell proliferation (IL-2, CD40L, TNFa, IL-21) generated large quantities of IgG (mean 12lg/ml, IQR 1.8-19), and often high levels of AQP4-antibodies. The number of plasmablasts and total-IgG generated per well in vitro showed little variation across the wide-range of supernatant AQP4antibody levels, suggesting the baseline frequency of AQP4-specific B-cells determined the AQP4-antibody levels in culture.

Without cognitive impairment, REM sleep behavior disorder, falls, or hallucinations. On examination he had normal cognition, mild torticollis and upper extremity myoclonus. There was bilateral parkinsonism; decremental small amplitude rapid alternating movements in all limbs, tremulousness, and reduced asymmetric arm swing. There was marked hypokinetic dysarthria and apraxia of speech. Asymmetric limb and orofacial apraxia was noted. Strength, sensory and cerebellar exams were normal. There was no gaze palsy or postural instability. Investigations revealed normal complete blood count, paraneoplastic antibody levels, ceruloplasmin, liver, renal and thyroid function. Multichannel surface electromyography confirmed cortical myoclonus affecting the upper extremities but no evidence of tremor. MRI brain revealed left greater than right parietal lobe atrophy. This correlated with left lateral fronto-parietal and bilateral medial fronto-parietal hypometabolism on FDG-PET scan. I-123 ioflupane DAT/SPECT scan confirmed pre-synaptic dopaminergic deficit, with asymmetrically left > right reduced putaminal uptake.

Regional [18F]AV-1451 uptake was calculated for 49 cortical and subcortical regions-of-interest across the brain and median uptake in each region was divided by median uptake in cerebellar crus grey matter to create SUVRs.

However, when compared to controls their performance on the manikin was also impaired suggesting they also have a perceptual impairment. The brain is a distributed network that operates at small and large spatial and temporal scales to meet the needs of the task at hand. Certain tasks generate conflict by requiring attention to relevant stimuli among distractions. Engagement in conflict-based tasks elicits network activity that differentiates these tasks from other behavior. Brain states associated with conflict in experimental behavioral contexts may be an important marker of dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric illness, yet there are no documented decoders that predict engagement in conflict-based tasks through invasive, large scale local field potential recordings. In addition, there is evidence that precisely timed Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) could restore normal behavioral task dynamics in neuropsychiatric patients, however these findings were limited to within task features. In the present study, we have developed a decoding strategy to accurately predict task engagement by harnessing canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a measure of functional connectivity between regions, in tandem with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Cortical and sub-cortical invasive local field potential recordings were collected in patients engaged in one of two Stroop-like tasks, including the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), and the Emotional Conflict Resolution Task (ECR). Canonical correlation coefficients were extracted by performing Singular Value Decompositions on windows of data across all channels within each region, and transforming the resulting singular vectors in a way that maximally correlates activity between each region pair. These CCA features were used as inputs to an SVM classifier to differentiate functional connectivity between task engagement and free behavior. A mean classification accuracy of 95.3% (MSIT med: 96.7 6 2.3%, ECR med: 95.0 6 3.2%) was achieved for both tasks across 14 patients, and a subset of features per patient were isolated that are required to maintain high accuracy (MSIT: med 3 6 3.4 region pairs, ECR: med 4 6 6.6 region pairs). The reduced feature set can be used to reduce the computational complexities of the algorithm moving forward, which points to potential tractability for driving a simple algorithm to detect task engagement on existing systems. While decoder stability was not achieved over two recordings, classification accuracy improved when trained on both recordings. This increase in accuracy suggests that training the classifier on many temporally separated data could improve its stability. Detection of task-associated brain states could ultimately be a closed-loop strategy for delivering real-time therapy to patients with neuropsychiatric illness. Background: Social cognition and interaction are indispensable in everyday life. Nonetheless, the social brain network and its dysfunction after brain damage remains little understood, in particular in regard to non-verbal social communication.",

Neuropsychiatric Testing: MMPI -2: invalid, consistent with malingering. Validity Electric lighting is one of the greatest technological advances in human history, and until recently it was assumed to be innocuous. In contrast, chronic exposure to light at night has been linked to poor clinical outcomes in a variety of serious health conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and obesity. Many of these negative effects of night shift work or chronic exposure to light at night have been attributed to disrupted sleep. By comparison, very little is known about the physiological and behavioral consequences associated with short-term exposure to light at night. We hypothesized that light at night has rapid effects on physiology and behavior and predicted that even a few nights of exposure to dim light would precipitate depressive-like behavior and associated neurological changes. We studied nocturnal mice so that light at night would not interfere with daytime sleep. Adult male and female mice were acclimated to a standard light/dark cycle [14h light (150 lux)/10 h dark (0 lux)] and then either maintained in this light/dark cycle or transferred to dim light at night [14h light (150 lux)/10 h dim light (5 lux)] conditions for four consecutive evenings. Mice exposed to dim light at night for just four nights displayed increased floating in a forced swim test relative to mice exposed to dark nights (P<0.05), indicative of increased depressive-like behavior. There was a concomitant reduction in hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein concentration (P<0.05) and hippocampal blood vessel staining with tomato lectin (P<0.05) among the mice exposed to dim light at night relative to the mice housed in dark nights. Reduced VEGF expression has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression, however, this study provides the first evidence that VEGF expression is modulated by night-time light exposure and that this fairly subtle environmental cue precipitates depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, the responses of both male and female mice to dim light at night were similar. Together, these data indicate that even short-term exposure to light at night has physiological and behavioral consequences.",

We present one such case of a 46-year-old man who presented with acute, persistent hiccups and subacute executive dysfunction.",

Houston, TX Background: Eagle Syndrome is a condition characterized by elongation of the styloid process secondary to ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. The elongated styloid process (ESP) can come into contact and interfere with adjacent anatomical structures. Rarely, an ESP comes into contact with the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), giving rise to the \"Vascular\" form of Eagle Syndrome. Vascular Eagle Syndrome has been implicated as a cause of both carotid artery compression and dissection.

Further, a lesioned SLF acutely is associated with long-term naming deficits (i.e., failure to recover naming). This suggests that both regions, when damaged acutely, contribute to naming recovery. As they are only associated with low naming scores at 4-7 months, but not acutely, this could mean that they independently/synergistically contribute to naming deterioration, or failure to improve, from acute to chronic stage (4 patients had worse naming at 4 27 months). Naming involves many cognitive processes and SLF and pSTG have been proposed to be part of language pathways. Results show that grey matter regions, as well as the status of white matter tracts (e.g. SLF) that connect components of language cortex can influence language recovery in stroke survivors.

However, our results indicate that NCCT is inadequate for detecting acute posterior-fossa ischemic stroke. MRI-DWI outperforms NCCT for detecting infratentorial strokes, but false negative MRI-DWI is seen in roughly one in four brainstem strokes in the first 48 hours after stroke onset. For patients presenting acute, non-specific, potentially posterior circulation symptoms (e.g., dizziness/vertigo), providers should consider alternative diagnostic strategies shown to have higher sensitivity (e.g., eye-movement-based physiologic diagnosis).

Pharmacokinetics of LEV and decreased perfusion status after MCA occlusion could lower the LEV concentration of infarcted area, prevent LEV neuroprotective effect. Background: Lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 140 mm Hg is a clinical recommendation to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Intensive intervention to lower SBP below 120 mm Hg resulted in reductions in both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events as well as mortality in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). However, this study reported higher rates of hypotension in the target group for SBP < 120 mm Hg, which could have resulted in decreased cerebral perfusion pressure and increased stroke risk.

Typically it is characterized by the unilateral appearance of mydriasis, lid retraction and exophthalmos. It is named after a French anatomist and ophthalmologist who was also the first one to identify clinical symptoms of what is now known as Horner's Syndrome. He noticed that soldiers who had suffered head wounds sometimes manifested symptoms of sympathetic hyperactivity in ocular system and upper extremity which is known as PdP. Typically, PdP occurs following irritative cervical injury/irritative compression of the sympathetic fibers. We describe a case which suggest similar symptoms in the setting of a basilar artery stroke whereby loss of parasympathetic response led to PDP syndrome.",

Our patient presented an interesting dilemma where she had bilateral complete third nerve palsy from a basilar artery stroke affecting the midbrain. She was noted to periods of sympathetic hyperactivity and this seemed to be extremely pronounced especially as the parasympathetic activity was lost due to bilateral complete third nerve palsy. Our hypothesis is that the occurrence of periods of sympathetic overactivity associated with bilateral mydriasis and hyperhidrosis is similar to picture observed with PdP syndrome albiet now being caused by a central lesion. Neurologists should be aware about PdP syndrome which is a reverse Horner's Syndrome and its etiologies to help localize the lesion. Background: Stroke remains the leading cause of disability worldwide with the only acute treatment, reperfusion, being critically time-dependent. The odds of a favorable outcome decrease with every additional minute of delay. Mobile ambulance-based telemedicine presents a novel solution to improving both the accuracy of prehospital stroke diagnosis and the timeliness of treatment. Implementation and sustainability of such innovative technology can be made difficult by the complexities of healthcare organizations, work practices and physical environments. Before implementing a new mobile prehospital telestroke program, we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the characteristics of our prehospital acute stroke care in an urban setting.",

However, headache was severe and persisting which brought him to his primary care doctor where an outpatient MRI was done, and showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. Patients was transferred to our hospital. His physical and neurological examinations remain stable. CT scan of the head (figure 1) was done and also a CT angiography with contrast which did not show any aneurysm. Patient then underwent a catheter-based angiogram. Figure 1 shows moderate hemorrhage within the fourth ventricle and a small volume of blood in the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle with mild obstructive hydrocephalus with dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles. There are scattered small foci of subarachnoid blood. Based on the distribution of the bleed, a PICA aneurysm was suspected which was confirmed with a catheter-based angiogram, which revealed presence of a distal right PICA aneurysm. The aneurysm was embolized successfully and patient remained in the neurological intensive care unit for monitoring. Patient examination was stable and headache subsided within days.",

Background: A prior meta-analysis and meta-regression revealed that higher doses of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have a better post-stroke upper-extremity motor recovery. While this finding suggests that currents greater than the typically used 2 mA may be more efficacious, the safety and tolerability of higher currents have not been systematically assessed in stroke patients. We aim to assess the safety and tolerability of single session of up to 4 mA current in stroke patients. Methods: We adapted a traditional 3 1 3 study design with a current escalation schedule of 1 > 2>2.5 > 3>3.5 > 4 mA for this tDCS safety study. We administered one 30-min session of bihemispheric montage tDCS and simultaneous customary occupational therapy to patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. We assessed safety with pre-defined stopping rules(clinical seizure; second degree skin burn; brain ischemia; discontinuation from the study due to any reason above) and investigated tolerability through a questionnaire. Additionally, we monitored body resistance and skin temperature in real-time at the electrode contact site. Results: Eighteen patients completed the study. The current was escalated to 4 mA without meeting the pre-defined stopping rules or causing any major safety concern. 50% of patients experienced transient skin redness without injury. No rise in temperature (range: 26 235 C) was noted and skin barrier function remained intact (i.e. body resistance >1 kX). Conclusion: Our phase I safety study supports that single session of bihemispheric tDCS with current up to 4 mA is safe and tolerable in chronic stroke patients. A phase II study to further test the safety and preliminary efficacy with multi-session tDCS at 4 mA (as compared with lower current and sham stimulation) is a logical next step.

            "text": "Conclusions: This work demonstrates that social factors such as race, gender, educational status, and employment status should be included in addition to clinical variables in a comprehensive predictive model of mortality post aSAH. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a debilitating neurological disorder caused by mutations in the peroxisomal half transporter, ABCD1. ABCD1 transporters are essential for the import of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) such as C26:0-CoA, C24:0-CoA, and C22:0-CoA from the cytosol. ALD patients are marked by the accumulation of VLCFAs intracellularly as well as in blood plasma. Building on our previous studies demonstrating upregulationof TGFBeta1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) following ABCD1 silencing here we studied its downstream molecular and functional contribution to endothelial permeability to inflammatory cells. Silencing of ABCD1 leads to an increase in SMAD3 phosphorylation and an approximate 2-fold increase in pSMAD3/SMAD3 ratio and downregulation of claudin-5, a brain specific tight junction protein. By comparing HBMEC to mouse brain microvascular endothelial cellls (MBMEC), we also found that MBMEC do not display ABCD1 dependent changes in TGF-b1 activation or claudin5 levels. The lipid analysis also confirmed that the expression and distribution of tight junction protein and adhesion molecules occurs even before the elevation of VLFCA in ABCD1 deficient HBMEC but not in MBMEC. A transcriptome analysis confirmed an upregulated TGF-b and extracellular matrix pathways and downregulated Nf-kB signaling pathways in HBMECs lacking ABCD1. These molecular changes corresponded with a 2 fold increase in the adhesion and 1.5 fold increase in transmigration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCS) selectively in human ABCD1-deficient brain endothelium. Notably, medium supplementation of recombinant TGFBeta1 to MBMEC led to downregulation of Claudin5 levels. Our results strongly suggest that brain microvascular endothelial dysfunction following ABCD1 silencing is mediated by upregulation of the TGFBeta1 pathway. Cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH), an important marker for vascular and Alzheimer's dementia, is frequently noted in patients with chronic heart disease. However, the dynamic link underlying cardiac hemodynamics and the progression of WMH has not been elucidated. We hypothesized that chronically altered cardiac hemodynamics may have a major influence on various mechanisms of cerebral WMH progression and investigated comprehensive cardiac hemodynamic markers in relation with the severity of WMH in patients with chronic valvular heart disease. We included 232 consecutive individuals with a valvular heart disease (!1 year from the initial diagnosis) who were !50 years of age, and had undergone cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, and brain MRI as pre-surgical evaluations. Patients with a history of territorial stroke or other demonstrated CNS diseases were excluded. Cardiac catheterization parameters such as right atrial (RA) mean pressure, right ventricular mean pressure, and aortic mean pressure, and echocardiographic factors such as left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, and E/e' ratio were obtained. WMH burden was measured using volumetric analysis. The mean WMH volume was 5.93 6 7.14 mL, and mean RA pressure was 10.0 6 4.7 mmHg. From the catheterization data, 147 (63.4%) patients had a disease involving mitral valve, ninety-three (40.1%) involving aortic valve, thirty-seven (15.9%) involving tricuspid valve, and two (0.9%) involving pulmonary valve. In the multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting the type and mechanism of valve disease and clinical, echocardiographic, and other catheterization parameters, WMH volume was linearly associated with mean RA pressure (P<0.001), along with age (P50.023), and mean aortic pressure (P50.019). Our findings indicate that mean right atrial pressure is independently associated with the WMH volume in patients with chronic valvular heart disease. Chronically elevated mean RA pressure may influence the various pathomechanism underlying the cerebral WMH progression.",

Philadelphia and Phildelphia PHACE syndrome (posterior fossa defects, hemangioma, arterial anomalies, coarctation of the aorta and cardiac defects, eye abnormalities) is a constellation of findings of unknown etiology. Diagnosis of this condition requires presence of large segmental hemangioma with at least one major criteria, including posterior fossa brain anomalies (such as Dandy-Walker anomalies) or other hypoplasia or dysplasia of the mid or hind brain. Early diagnosis of this condition is critical to minimizing long term effects of these congenital abnormalities. We report nine patients with ultimate diagnosis of PHACE syndrome who had abnormal brain findings on prenatal ultrasounds. Patients were seen in our Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment from 2007 to 2017. Intracranial abnormalities were characterized by fetal MRI. Electronic health records were reviewed to determine the additional evaluation for PHACE syndrome, including postnatal imaging, management, and postnatal outcomes. Fetal MRI studies were significant for unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia or cystic lesions in all patients. Other intracranial findings included asymmetric Meckel's cave and ventricular abnormalities. These findings should prompt further evaluation in utero, including fetal echocardiogram. In addition, early postnatal evaluation by Dermatology, Cardiology, Neurology, and Ophthalmology are critical for effectively managing patients with PHACE syndrome. It is now clear that aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) mediated glymphatic flow (GF) is responsible for b-amyloid clearance and GF disturbance plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). AQP-4 is known to be blocked by higher extracellular pH (acidosis) and, therefore, AQP-4 functionality and, hence, GF can be facilitated by an alkaline shift in the extracellular fluid. Guanidinoethyl sulphonate (GES) has been shown to be an effective alkaline shifter in vivo, and exhibits virtually no significant adverse effects (NeuroReport 1993; 4:1035) . Accordingly, we investigated the preventive effects of orally administered GES on senile plaque (SP) formation in transgenic APP-PS1-Tg AD model mice. Male B6SJL-Tg (APPSwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V) 6799Vas/Mmjax AD model mice and age matched wild type (WT) mice were raised in our laboratory. AD model and WT mice were divided into two groups (experimental vs. control). Experimental mice received water containing 1% GES from 4 months of age for 12 weeks. Senile plaque (SP) formation was assessed immunohistologically using Aquacosmos (Hamamatsu Photonics) (Ann Neurol. 2016 80:554-565) . AD model experimental mice showed significantly reduced SP formation compared to control AD model mice. No adverse effects of GES were detected in either of the experimental mouse groups. The study unequivocally demonstrated that the GF facilitator GES, given orally, significantly retards SP formation. Considering that there were virtually no identifiable adverse effects of oral GES, this agent appears to be a realistic agent for AD prevention and/or treatment.",

La Jolla, CA and San Francisco, CA Nervous system growth factors have extensive effects on neuronal function and survival. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) influences the survival and function of entorhinal and hippocampal neurons in several animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including transgenic mutant APP-expressing mice, aged rats and lesioned rats, and aged and lesioned primates. Accordingly, BDNF represents a potential treatment that could both reduce the rate of neuronal loss in AD and improve the function of remaining neurons. Beneficial effects of BDNF in animal models appear to occur independent of detectable alterations in beta amyloid load, representing an alternative treatment strategy to amyloid-modifying approaches under development for AD. However, BDNF does not appreciably cross the BBB, and exhibits potential off-target effects when broadly spread through the CNS; therefore it must be directly administered intracerebrally and its spread must be restricted to regions of cell degeneration. Gene therapy is one means of achieving practical and safe BDNF delivery in AD. We have now developed methods for accurate targeting and regionally-restricted AAV2-BDNF gene delivery in the non-human primate brain using real-time MRI guidance and co-infusion of the MRI contrast agent gadoteridol. AAV2-BDNF gene delivery to the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus is safe and well-tolerated in rhesus monkeys for up to 18 months. This program is on a translational path, aiming to test the hypothesis that BDNF will exhibit neuroprotective and functional-enhancing properties in AD.",

However, during disease tau detaches from the microtubules and misfolds forming aggregates and inclusions such as the intracellular Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs). Tau oligomers are small, dynamic and soluble structures that have shown to be more toxic and efficient seeds for the propagation of pathology, compared to the large metastable NFTs. It has been demonstrated that tau oligomers manifest in different conformations, termed tau oligomeric strains. Importantly, different strains could explain how the aggregation of the same protein causes different diseases, progression rates and phenotypes, even between individuals within the same disorder. We hypothesize that small molecules able to bind and modulate tau aggregation pathways thus neutralizing their formation and toxicity and preventing the spread of pathology. Herein, we used in vitro techniques such as Western Blot and direct ELISA as well as biophysical assays to characterize tau oligomeric strains and their reactivity with tau oligomer specific polyclonal antibody T22, in the presence and absence of newly synthetized curcumin derivatives. Our data shown that curcumin related compounds are able to modulate tau aggregation pathways, thus neutralizing their formation and toxicity and preventing the progression of the pathology. The successful completion of this proposal will deliver compelling data that will move the tau field forward both in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for AD and other tauopathies. Furthermore, small molecules that target oligomeric tau strains associated with different neurodegenerative tauopathies can be used in the diagnostic field as imaging agents for the early detection of toxic tau oligomeric strains. Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders of impaired protein homeostasis. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in protein homeostasis and metabolism by dictating whether a cell engages in anabolic growth and protein synthesis or catabolic protein degradation via lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. TSC1/hamartin is an upstream inhibitor of mTOR with mutations that were previously associated with juvenile-onset tuberous sclerosis (TS).

Neuropathological evaluation of resected temporal lobe tissue from a TSC1 mutation carrier also demonstrated increased phospho-tau without accumulation of TDP-43, alpha-synuclein, Abeta or ubiquitin.",

            "text": "These studies suggest that TSC1 could represent a new neurodegenerative disease gene, although additional genetic, pathological and experimental studies will be needed to definitively establish this relationship. However, this potential link between mTOR signaling and impaired tau metabolism provides a novel site of impairment in protein homeostasis that could result in a neurodegenerative tauopathy. It also suggests a potentially treatable mechanism for age-associated, tau-related neurodegeneration. Heterozygous mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 cause autosomal dominantly inherited Alzheimer Disease (AD). Whether PSEN mutations lead to a toxic gain of function, dominant negative or loss of function leading to neurodegeneration is not well established. We previously reported a 56 year-old woman with early onset AD found to have a novel heterozygous PSEN2 2-base pair deletion leading to a frame shift and premature termination codon in exon 5 (PSEN2 115Fx). The variant is predicted to result in a truncated PS2 peptide or lead to nonsense mediated decay. Given the uniqueness of the case, pathogenicity of the mutation could not be strongly confirmed. Here we report the identification of a second and unrelated early onset AD case carrying the PSEN2 115Fx heterozygous mutation discovered during a targeted exome screen of 150 early-onset dementia cases. The subject had a maternal family history of AD, was diagnosed with dementia at age 51 and died 3 years later. Autopsy confirmed diagnosis of AD showing amyloid angiopathy, Braak Stage V, and numerous neuritic plaques. To begin to understand the pathogenic mechanism of PSEN2 115Fx in AD we assessed its expression and function in primary patient tissue. Stability of the PSEN2 115Fx transcript was measured through RNA analysis of frozen cortex and fibroblasts. To investigate the impact of mutation on PS2 protein we performed Western blot analysis on fibroblasts and lymphocytes isolated from control subjects and AD patients carrying PSEN2 115Fx or PSEN2 N141I mutations. We found that cells isolated from a PSEN2 115Fx carrier showed decreased PS2 C-terminal fragment suggesting insufficient compensation for PS2 levels by the wildtype allele. We assessed APP processing capacity of PSEN2 115Fx by measuring Ab40 in conditioned media from fibroblasts. We observed decreased Ab40 in both PSEN2 115Fx and PSEN2 N141 compared to controls, demonstrating that like PSEN2 N141I, PSEN2 115Fx results in a biochemical loss of function as measured by Ab40 extracellular release. In conclusion, we report evidence demonstrating loss of normal PS2 levels and function in the PSEN2 115Fx that strongly suggests pathogenicity of this novel mutation. Further, the biological and genetic features associated with this type of variant underscore the complexity of PSEN2 mutation mechanisms of action causing AD.",

Albany, NY Introduction: This report describes a patient with a phenotype of corticobasal syndrome and frontotemporal dementia who showed Alzheimer's disease on neuropathological examination at autopsy. Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent type of dementia affecting at least 48 million people worldwide. There are typical amnestic variants commonly seen in practice and atypical variants, with a diagnosis made only through neuropathologic confirmation. Corticobasal degeneration is another neurodegenerative disease in the group of frontotemporal tauopathies, with a four repeat isomer tauopathy on pathology. It has a clinical syndrome of extrapyramidal signs, cognitive loss, and parietal lobe function impairment, termed corticobasal syndrome because it may not always correspond to the correct pathologic diagnosis.",

On cognitive testing, she displayed deficits involving short-term memory, executive functioning, verbal fluency, organization/ planning, and visual-spatial abilities. She was impulsive, disinhibited, and anxious, and notably abulic. Her motor exam showed axial, as well as predominantly left sided rigidity and apraxia, which progressed to an alien hand on the left. She was trialed on Aricept, but did not tolerate it due to increased anxiety and nausea. While her episodic and visualspatial memory deficits pointed to elements of typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease, her parkinsonism, apraxia, and alien hand suggested corticobasal degeneration and her disinhibition, abulia, and frontal release signs suggested frontal lobe involvement. Her MRI showed mild diffuse cortical atrophy and small vessel ischemic disease, and a PET scan was not done as the patient refused. Neuropathological exam at autopsy revealed amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles severe in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex, moderately in the hippocampus and limbic system, and minimally in the neocortex, confirming the diagnosis of Alzheimer's pathology, Braak stage III-IV.",

            "text": "Discussion: Cognitive decline in the elderly can present as a challenging diagnosis with unclear etiology. Despite clinical presentation and history, pathologic correlates on autopsy ultimately may reveal an unexpected result. While there are a growing body of case studies showing corticobasal syndrome that later reveals Alzheimer's pathology on autopsy, this case also has elements of frontal lobe symptoms, which in some discussions are more prevalent in corticobasal degeneration pathology. The case allows practitioners to appreciate the fluidity within the spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders as well as the importance of confirming a pathological diagnosis. Rationale: There is a critical role for tau in transducing Ab-linked neurotoxicity and tau pathology is temporally and regionally-related to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing the synthesis of tau should decrease all isoforms, post-translational modifications and conformational states of tau in all compartments. In mice, homozygous and hemizygous knockout of endogenous tau expression is protective against many Ab insults (Morris M, et al. Neuron 2011; 70; 410-26) . In transgenic mouse models, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) mediated binding and degradation of human MAPT gene pre-mRNA reversed pre-existing tau pathology and seeding activity, prevented neurodegeneration and functional deficits and extended survival (DeVos SL, et al. Science Translational Medicine 9, 2017) . Based on these findings, an ASO that would bind and degrade the pre-mRNA transcribed from the MAPT gene and thereby reduce synthesis of tau protein was identified suitable for human clinical trials.",

However, when assessing amyloid-positive symptomatic AD patients, E4 was associated with increased AV1451 binding in the MTL. This suggests that, in addition to its effect of Ab pathology, E4 might influence the topographical distribution of tau pathology, and potentially the cognitive symptoms in patients. Rationale: Pathogenic mutations in Presenilin (PSEN) 1, 2 or amyloid precursor protein (APP) lead to autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) by altering beta-amyloid production and deposition. Though these mutations are all highly penetrant, in vitro studies suggest that there is substantial molecular diversity in the amyloid species produced by each mutation. Using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), we examine inter-genotypic variance in the temporal pattern of amyloid burden assessed using both Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab42.

The same effect was not observed in CSF Ab42, suggesting greater inter-genotypic variance in fibrillar, insoluble amyloid as compared to amyloid species measured in CSF. These results are relevant for the use of PiB PET and CSF Ab42 in ongoing ADAD prevention trials, and, more broadly, in understanding how CSF-vs. PET-based amyloid measurements may relate to AD-related cognitive decline. Background: Delirium is an underrecognized, highly morbid, potentially preventable condition among hospitalized neurological patients. Multimodal interventions have been shown to be effective at preventing delirium. Residents are in a unique position to implement these changes.

New York, NY Background: Physician burnout is a significant problem in modern medicine, and neurologists show significantly higher rates of burnout compared with other specialists (1). This problem begins early in training, and burnout among neurology residents has been associated with decreased professional development (2). There is a clear need for programs which can reduce neurologist burnout, beginning at the residency phase of training, to lay the groundwork for reversing this crisis among practicing physicians. Methods: The Mental Health Comes First Program (MHC1) was developed by neurology residents as a quality improvement initiative designed to foster meaningful connections between residents, with an emphasis on previously validated topics of mindfulness, burnout, meaning in medicine, and self care (3). Each neurology resident was partnered for the duration of an academic year with two other residents (these are their MHC1-Links, one individual from each of the other two PGY levels). Monthly, each resident has a brief discussion with their two MHC1-Links. The distributed list of suggested topics for discussion focuses on the validated wellness-enhancing themes indicated above (3). Once all residents have completed the monthly program, the chain of support across the entire residency is completed. Efficacy of the program is measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). A baseline survey was administered at the beginning of the program, and on an ongoing basis three times annually (4) .",

The diagnostic yield of ictal SPECT can be increased by applying statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to the study.

Such an approach may have a role in the multimodality evaluation of surgical epilepsy patients. Electrical brain stimulation has been used as a therapeutic intervention for some neurological disorders, including refractory epilepsy. Deep brain and vagal nerve stimulation treatments have proven effective in suppressing interictal spikes, which are transient electrographic events linked with impaired cognition in epileptic patients. Interictal spiking correlates negatively with behavioral performance in a word list memory task during both encoding and recall periods in several brain regions (Horak, Epilepsia, 2016). Electrical stimulation applied during this cognitive task could modulate interictal spiking and impact behavioral performance.",

Birmingham, AL Loss of hippocampal internal architecture clarity has long been known as a radiographic feature of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, along with the other hallmark features of HS -hippocampal atrophy and signal abnormality. While hippocampal atrophy and signal abnormality are easily recognized in conventional MR imaging, detection of loss of hippocampal internal architecture clarity is directly related to the ability of the MRI sequence in use to depict hippocampal internal architecture clearly in the normal hippocampus. While the internal architecture, specifically the gray matter of Ammon's horn and the intervening white matter, may be seen clearly in isolated hippocampal slices, it is difficult to image consistently in most slices through the hippocampus. Because internal architecture is not seen consistently in normal hippocampal slices, it is difficult to assess its absence with confidence in potentially abnormal hippocampi. This is due to volume averaging effects with the thick slices used in highresolution MRI. We overcome this challenge using a MRI technique we refer to as HR-MICRA to generate high-resolution images with thin slices using a conventional 3T scanner, and compare the clarity of these images with conventional T2w MRI.",

Sharp. Cleveland, OH Voltage-dependent Ca21 channels (VDCC) are key mediators of Ca21 influx, with low-voltage activated (LVA) VDCC contributing to developmental processes and modulation of adult neuronal excitability. Three distinct gene products, CaV3.1 (alpha1G), CaV3.2 (alpha1H), and CaV3.3 (alpha1I), give rise to LVA VDCC (T-type) currents. While their electrophysiological properties are well characterized, the biochemical properties of LVA VDCC are unknown. In this study, we take guidance from the observation that the primary sequences of CaV3 alpha1 subunits predict structural homology to both high-voltage activated (HVA) VDCC alpha1 and voltage-dependent sodium channel (VDSC) alpha subunits (NaV). Both families have welldefined biochemical features that offered valuable insight into their post-translational modification and assembly into complexes. With these defining features in mind, we explored the biochemical properties of all three recombinant LVA VDCC alpha1 subunits stably expressed in HEK293 cells and rat cerebellar CaV3.1. Using a panel of isoformspecific antibodies, we determined that LVA VDCC alpha1 subunits possess a unique subset of biochemical features that distinguishes them from both HVA VDCC and VDSC. Specifically, all recombinant CaV3 isoforms and endogenous CaV3.1 are highly glycosylated, similar to alpha subunits of VDSC and distinct from HVA VDCC alpha1. The presence of N-linked glycosylation on recombinant and endogenous CaV3 isoforms was exploited to partially purify the proteins on a lectin column. Another property that distinguishes VDSC from HVA VDCC is the covalent attachment of a beta2/beta4 subunit to the VDSC alpha subunit via a disulfide bond. Under conditions that recapitulate the increased mobility of a VDSC alpha subunit following disulfide-bond reduction, neither recombinant nor endogenous CaV3.1 shifted in electrophoretic mobility suggesting that LVA VDCC alpha1 do not associate with a VDSC beta2/beta4 homologue. This study presents the first characterization of the biochemical properties of LVA alpha1 subunits and suggests novel strategies for approaching their assembly, maturation, and purification. Background: Perampanel, one of the most recently introduced anti-epileptic drugs, is unique in that it inhibits AMPA receptor. With the novel mechanism distinct from the previous drugs, perampanel as an adjunctive treatment successfully reduced generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) in epilepsy patients. Moreover, 5-10% of patients became seizure-free. However, perampanel showed some adverse effects (AEs) including psychosis such as aggressiveness and suicidal attempt. Here, we investigated the efficacy and AEs of perampanel in Korean adult patients.",

New York, NY Objective: Procedural and psychometric confounds often limit the reliability and validity of neuropsychological testing in non-native English-speaking candidates for epilepsy surgery. Beyond the increased probability of atypical language representation in bilinguals and/or tonal language speakers, the use of medical interpreters with varying degrees of fluency and expertise, and the use of tests which were neither developed for, nor standardized with, nonnative English-speaking neurological populations, are all clearly immutable sources of test bias. The prognostic value of neuropsychological testing in localizing and lateralizing underlying neuropathology is perhaps most critical in presurgical contexts; however, the diagnostic accuracy of cognitive metrics is highly variable in culturally-and linguistically-diverse patient populations.

Houston, TX A major challenge in the field of brain connectivity is relating connectivity metrics to the brain state of interest. An influential view describes the unconsciousness of sleep arising from fragmentation of integrated cortical modules. Yet the propensity for focal seizures to occur -and generalize-in the sleep state implies a hyperconnectedness (hypersynchrony). Electrocorticography (ECoG) from six patients undergoing prolonged video-EEG telemetry with subdural grid electrodes was analyzed. Segments of wakefulness and sleep were comb-filtered into the canonical Berger EEG bands. Using a novel method for modeling ECoG spectra, the sleep-wake state of the ECoG was assigned a continuous numerical score over sliding windows of 30s duration. Correlations between the score and concurrently computed graph-theoretic connectivity metrics were drawn. We found that the coherence network modularity in the beta and gamma bands -relevant to high-frequency seizure-onset rhythms -correlated positively with wakefulness, while alpha modularity correlated negatively. Thus, ECoG-based brain connectivity metrics are both state (sleep-wake) dependent and waveform frequency dependent. It is possible for the cortex to be 'disconnected' with respect to conscious wakefulness in the sleep state, yet 'hyperconnected' with respect to transmission of epileptic seizures.",

At age 7, M.S. had a 20-minute event during which she stood still, without response to verbal or physical stimuli, and without convulsions, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence. She then vomited and seemed more tired than usual. She was brought to an emergency department, where an emergent electroencephalogram revealed several 5-10 second runs of 3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave activity correlated with lack of response to verbal stimuli, consistent with absence epilepsy. She was started on ethosuximide, and tolerated this well with no breakthrough seizures in fourmonth follow-up. Although D.S. had no episodes concerning for seizures, she underwent a screening electroencephalogram over 48 hours given her sister's diagnosis. D.S. had multiple periods of 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges, but no clinical events. Based on these findings, she was also started on ethosuximide, and tolerated this well with no clinical seizures in two-month follow-up. This case illustrates an important example of screening a twin of a known patient with epilepsy, as it can reveal abnormalities that warrant treatment despite lack of clinical events.",

(1) A radiologistderived edema score from 1-8, (2) a single, midsagittal linear prepontine anterior-posterior (AP) measure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space, (3) the SamKam ratio of the right parietal lobe height/(prepontine AP dimension14th ventricle AP dimension) and (4) a global assessment of the cerebrospinal fluid space ascertained manually via Clear Canvas. Only a subset of children survive long enough and remain in coma long enough to allow serial imaging. For those with serial imaging, we evaluated the ROC for (5) the global assessment of CSF space on the second MRI. Finally, the ROC for a (6) recovery factor variable comprised of the global CSF space on the second divided by the initial MRI was evaluated.",

Detailed review of Malawi imaging shows that Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) was also present in a significant subset of children with CM. The pathophysiology of PRES is thought to be related to hyperperfusion and/or endothelial injury. Histologically, the hallmark of CM is parasite sequestration in the cerebral vasculature due to parasitized red blood cell adherence to microvascular endothelium.

In 1925, there was a boom in nervous physiology thanks to Harvard researchers Walter Cannon and his Mexican collaborators Arturo Roseblueth and Jose Joaquin Izquierdo, who described the function of the autonomic nervous system. In 1936, Teodoro Flores Covarrubias built his own EEG machine and started electrophysiological studies.

In vitro and in vivo work suggest that Toxoplasma strain-specific polymorphic effector proteins injected into host cells can lead to different innate immune responses. Thus, we hypothesized that different Toxoplasma strains provoke distinct, strain-specific CNS immune responses, which in turn would affect disease outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we used quantitative immunohistochemistry to compare CNS immune responses in mice infected with either type II or type III parasites. At 3 weeks post infection (wpi), we found that despite having similar parasite burden, the CNS of type III-infected mice had a more pro-inflammatory immune response (macrophages and T-cell response, and cytokines/chemokines) as compared to type II-infected mice. Our flow cytometry analysis of immune cells isolated from the spleen and brain of 3 wpi mice also showed that type III-infected mice had a significantly lower numbers of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) and regulatory T cells as compared to type II-infected mice. However, early in infection (0.5 wpi) type III-infected mice had higher numbers of AAMs. Taking these data together, we propose that by inducing a robust pro-inflammatory response early on, type II infection provokes a tempering anti-inflammatory response that will ultimately hinder the host from eliminating CNS parasites. Conversely, early in infection type III parasites elicit a less inflammatory response which converts to a stronger pro-inflammatory response as parasites expand and disseminate, ultimately resulting in a highly effective immune response capable of clearing CNS parasites. Consistent with this model, at 16 wpi, we find that type IIIinfected mice have a much lower CNS parasite burden compared to type II-infected mice. Current work is identifying the parasite and host factors that determine these strain specific differences in the CNS outcomes.

The recent EVD epidemic in West Africa resulted in more than 10,000 reported cases with over 5,000 survivors in Liberia alone.",

Background: NS is an epileptic encephalopathy with head nodding and other seizure types, developmental delay, and behavioral changes. Described in Tanzania in the 1960s, epidemics of NS occurred in South(ern) Sudan (from 1991) and Uganda (2000-13) , with affected children more heavily infected with nematodes (Onchocerca volvulus, Mansonella sp.) than controls. Our 2014 case-control study of NS revealed a case association with prior measles infection, and a clinical course consistent with a postviral disorder akin to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, suggesting nematode infection is a bystander that capitalized on prior viral infection (Spencer et al., J. Neurol. Sci. 369:191, 2016 & 372:441, 2017 . Onset of head nodding was associated with poor nutrition, food dependence on moldy maize, the associated mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins) potentially activating a latent neural virus or changing the epileptogenic threshold. Given the absence of new NS cases in 2014 and resumption of a usual diet across the community, we tested the hypothesis that mycotoxin load, a reflection of contaminated food intake in the past few days, would currently not differ between NS cases and controls.",

Cleveland, OH Introduction: Paclitaxel-induced neuropathy is associated with morphologic and biochemical alterations in dorsal root ganglia satellite cells, hyperplasia/hypertrophy of macrophages in the peripheral nervous system, and microglial and astrocyte activation within the spinal cord. This neuroinflammatory process causes central sensitization, leading to the persistent pain states. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine how paclitaxel alters pain sensation due to microglia activation and central sensitization. Cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) is expressed primarily in the immune system including microglia in the CNS. MDA7 is a novel selective CB2 agonist that has shown efficacy in ameliorating microglial activation and preventing allodynia in rodent models of neuropathic pain. Our study is expected to elucidate the mechanism underlying the paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain and its modulation by the CB2 receptor.",

Nashville, TN and New York, NY Mutations in genes encoding for voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.7 and Nav1.8) are typically associated with painful sensory neuropathies. In contrast, Nav1.9 (or SCN11A) is primarily expressed in nociceptive neurons of ganglia. A missense mutation (Arg225Cys) in the Nav1.9 has been described in two Chinese families with episodic pain syndrome (Zhang et al., AJHG, 2013) . However, it is still unclear whether the mutations in Nav1.9 cause nociceptive or neuropathic pain with sensory neuropathy. We have identified the Arg225Cys mutation in a Caucasian family. The proband (29-year-old woman) was initially diagnosed as having\"fibromyalgia\" due to her chronic aching in joints and muscles. However, her family history prompted genetic testing that demonstrated the Arg225Cys mutation in Nav1.9. Thus, we studied 5 additional family members with the \"fibromyalgia\" phenotype and one non-affected member. The Arg225Cys mutation was found in all 5 affected members, except the non-affected one by Sanger sequencing of their DNA. To determine the nature of the pain, we have developed a pain differential scale consisting of 15 questions. This scale was first validated in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (primarily nociceptive pain) and patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy (primarily neuropathic pain). The scale showed significantly more nociceptive pain for patients with ALS (p50.02) and more neuropathic pain for patients with DP (p50.01). This scale was then applied to the family and demonstrated almost exclusively nociceptive pain (9.0 6 7.2 nociceptive and 0.3 6 0.82 neuropathic; p50.015). Furthermore, nerve conduction studies in three affected family members showed no large fiber neuropathy. Skin biopsies from all 7 family members were used to quantify the epidermal nerve fiber density, which were all within the normative range. Thus, no patient had peripheral neuropathy. Our findings are significant in several aspects: 1. Patients with the Arg225Cys mutation and prominent nociceptive pain are in line with the known localization of Nav1.9 in nociceptive neurons, thereby supporting a human molecular target specific to the nociceptive pain; 2. Patients with chronic aching in joints, muscles or carrying a diagnosis of \"fibromyalgia\" might become potential candidates for identifying additional mutations in the SCN11A gene.

Objective: Brachial plexus injury (BPI) disproportionately affects young males causing lifelong disability and decreased quality of life (QOL). There is little familiarity among medical practitioners, including neurologists, about options that reconstructive neurosurgery offers. However, the field has an array of procedures that can effectively restore lost function. Restoration of elbow flexion remains a surgical priority and time is critical. Within the first six months to a year of injury, nerves can be transferred, as the weak muscle remains receptive to reinnervation. Beyond a year, options remain but are more limited. The most common procedure to re-innervate elbow flexion is the Oberlin procedure. This involves cutting redundant motor fascicles of the ulnar nerve as it passes the biceps and attaching this fascicle to the musculocutaneous branch just before entering the Biceps muscle, usually with excellent results. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis for performing this procedure. This model assesses QOL impact, surgical costs, and the possible income recovered through restoration of elbow flexion.",

In multivariate models LRRK2PD had higher odds of CD than IPD (OR52.13, p50.08) as well as controls (OR53.77, p50.09) although the comparisons were not significant. IPD were not more likely than controls to carry diagnosis of CD (OR51.75, p50.47) Conclusion: Self-report questionnaire data suggests that PD cases with LRRK2 G2019S mutations may be more likely to have CD than mutation negative PD and controls. The connection between LRRK2 mutations and CD further implicates an inflammatory pathway in LRRK2 PD, and particularly a role of Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK) as the mutation carriers harbored either G2019S or I2020T mutations. It is of interest that our study did not show an overall association between non-LRRK2 PD and controls, as would be expected based on other studies. Larger studies evaluating the connection between CD and PD, especially LRRK2 PD, are warranted. The transition from pre-manifest Huntington's disease (HD) to the observable movement disorder in symptomatic HD can be a gradual process spanning several years. Few studies have examined motor behaviors that predate the onset of frank chorea in HD. The presence of a biomarker early in the transition period may help efforts to pharmacologically manage or delay onset of this debilitating movement disorder. In the present study, we examined whether handwriting movement abnormalities are present prior to the manifestation of clinically overt chorea. Prior research has demonstrated that measures of handwriting kinematics are sensitive to mild pre-clinical motor abnormalities stemming from other basal ganglia disorders. Fifteen individuals testing positive for the HD genetic mutation on the huntingtin gene (mean CAG, 41.2) currently in a pre-manifest stage of the disease, 15 gene negative individuals (mean CAG, 20.5), and 16 clinically symptomatic HD patients (mean CAG, 42.7) participated in this study. Participants completed handwriting tasks consisting of writing simple and complex loops, rapid circles, spirals and a sentence, each repeated multiple times on a digitizing tablet using a non-inking pen. Multiple measures of pen stroke kinematics and pressure were extracted from these trials. The clinical status of each participant was characterized using the UHDRS. Statistical comparisons revealed significant differences between symptomatic HD and and pre-manifest subjects on several handwriting stroke features, particularly stroke duration and fluency. Discriminant function analyses were conducted to identify a multivariate model that distinguished pre-manifest from gene negative subjects. An 8-factor model consisting of stroke amplitude, velocity, fluency, and pressure (means and between stroke variability) for complex loops distinguished pre-manifest from gene negative subjects with 90% accuracy (F(8,21) 5 4.22; p<0.01) . A discriminant function model based solely on the UHDRS score achieved only 63% accuracy for separating pre-manifest from gene negative subjects. We observed statistically significant positive correlations between CAG repeat number and several handwriting variables among pre-manifest and symptomatic HD subjects including stroke duration and fluency for sentence writing and rapid circles. These findings support the clinical utility of dynamic measures of handwriting kinematics as a potential behavioral biomarker of disease progress in early HD. The Computerized Test of Information Processing (CTiP), is a relatively simple and useful tool for evaluating the extent to which neurological conditions affect cognitive processing speed. Administered on a laptop, it consists of three computerized reaction time (RT) subtests that progressively increase in task complexity-Simple RT (SRT); Choice RT (CRT), with an added decisional component; and Semantic Search RT (SSRT) with an added conceptual component. The objective of the current study was to examine central processing speed as an early marker of Huntington's disease (HD) onset using the CTiP. Gene carriers (n581) were categorized using the UHDRS Total Functional Capacity and Penny Burden of Pathology score as early premanifest, transitional (i.e. individuals close to disease onset or with very mild HD), or moderate HD. Subjects were administered the CTiP in addition to traditional cognitive assessments commonly used in HD. Central processing speed was measured using motor-corrected CRT and SSRT values. A one-way ANCOVA adjusting for age was used to compare group performance on the RT subtests. Moderate HD subjects showed significantly slower reaction times in all conditions (p<0.001), as compared to NC. Importantly, even transitional subjects showed significantly slower reaction times on the CRT (p<0.01) and SSRT (p<0.01), and in central cognitive processing, compared to NC. Our results suggest that the CTiP may be a useful and early marker of deficits in central cognitive processing in individuals with, and transitioning to, HD. Behavioral changes, including apathy, depression, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty prioritizing and initiating activities, are characteristic features of HD and may serve as an early marker of disease onset. The UCSD HD-BQ consists of 30 items with a 3-point rating scale (0-3), and takes about 5 minutes to complete. The maximum score is 90 with higher scores indicating greater severity. The objective of the current study was to utilize the UCSD Huntington's Disease Behavioral Questionnaire (HD-BQ) to assess behavioral changes that distinguish HD gene carriers transitioning to manifest HD. Gene positive subjects (n5118) were stratified using the UHDRS Total Functional Capacity and Penny Burden of Pathology score as early pre-manifest (EPM); transitional (i.e. individuals close to disease onset or with very mild HD); or mild-moderate manifest HD. The UCSD HD-BQ was administered to 22 normal control (NC); 29 EPM; 27 transitional, and 62 HD subjects. We used one-way ANOVA/Tukey Posthoc to compare groups on dependent variables and effect sizes to quantify the mean difference between each group. Mean MMSE, TFC, and TMS scores were 28.9, 12.8, and 1.7 respectively for NC; 28.2, 13.0, and 1.6 respectively for EPM; 27.3, 12.4, and 7.6 respectively for transitional; and 24.1, 8.2, and 35.6 respectively for manifest HD subjects. Although statistically significant differences were not seen between transitional or EPM subjects and NC with regard to these cognitive, functional and motoric measures, statistically significant differences were seen with regard to the HD-BQ between transitional (mean HD-BQ532.3; p50.000) and, more surprisingly, EPM (mean HD-BQ522.8, p50.011) subjects and NC (mean HD-BQ55.7). HD showed the largest effect size (0.620) compared to transitional (0.611) and EPM (0.481) subjects. Highest scoring symptoms among transitional and EPM subjects comprised anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and memory. We concluded that the HD-BQ is a brief, reliable instrument for screening behavioral changes in individuals at risk for, and transitioning to, HD. Behavioral disturbances are important in HD and may serve as an early marker of disease onset.",

Dr. Fekete served as a consultant for Teva Neuroscience, Lundbeck, LLC., Acadia Pharmaceutical, Inc., and Impax Laboratories, Inc. Background: There is heterogeneity in motor and nonmotor response to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). The underlying genetic etiology may help parse this heterogeneity. Mutations in the Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene are the most common genetic risk factors for PD and GBA-PD overall may have more cognitive decline, and faster progression. While cases with GBA-PD have been reported in DBS registries, cognitive decline is a possible relative contraindication for DBS in this group. Methods: We report a series of four patients (two women: (Patient 1(P1) and P2), two men: P3, P4) who underwent DBS surgery and harbored the GBA-N370S mutation. They underwent DBS for improvement of motor fluctuations (all) or dyskinesias (P2,P3). P1, P3 and P4 received bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation while P2 received bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) stimulation. Results: Average age at diagnosis was 55.3 and average age at DBS was 62.5. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores preoperative were compared with one year post-DBS scores. Part II (Activities of Daily Living) improved by an average of 5.3 (11.2 ! 5.9). UPDRS-III (Motor exam) improved by an average of 6.1 points (19.1 ! 13.0). This improvement was driven primarily by P2/P4 wile P1/P3 saw a slight worsening of motor symptoms. UPDRS-IV (Complications of Therapy) showed a significant reduction of 4.4 (5.1 ! 0.7) (two-year data used for P3). The dyskinesias reported by P1,P2,P3 were markedly reduced or absent at one year post-DBS. UPDRS Mentation Score (1-4) showed an average increase in 0.4 (0.9 ! 1.3). More comprehensive cognitive testing was performed on some patients, showing mildmoderate (P2), and mild (P4) frontal-subcortical dysfunction pre-DBS. Repeat testing post-DBS found progression of those deficits in both. However, there was an improvement of 0.6 points (3.7 ! 3.1) in Section I overall (Mentation, Behavior, and Mood). Reduction in DOPA-mg dose averaged 483.8 and ranged from 0 to 1400. Conclusions: Our cases also suggest a diversity of response, and that DBS may be well tolerated, at least short term, in GBA-PD with the mild N370S mutation. As a group, there was overall improvement in motor function and overall Part I \"mentation/behavior/mood\" scores despite decline in cognition. The relative improvement in Part I scores may be attributable to lower dose of medication afforded by the surgery. Comparison with GBA cases who did not receive DBS is underway.",

Background: Genetic studies of PD have identified multiple genetic risk loci associated with \"sporadic\" PD as well as mutations causing familial forms of PD. These studies have mainly focused on Caucasian populations. Some studies suggest PD may be less prevalent in African than European Americans, which could be due to ascertainment bias. Familial PD does occur in African-Americans. Genetic studies in African Americans may detect novel PD causing variants, which may be limited to this population. In this study, we aimed to identify mutations that cause PD in African American patients using whole exome sequencing.",

Studying genetic variation across different ethnicities can provide important insights into pathogenic variation and disease mechanisms. Background: PD is a heterogeneous disorder which can be classified into specific clinical subtypes. In a recent largescale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 28 genetic loci associated with increased PD risk were identified [1] .

In contrast to the rhythmical oscillations of essential tremor, atypical tremors are ataxic and characterized as irregular, coarse, slow, high amplitude movements affecting proximal and distal parts of a limb that can be present at rest, posture and with intention.

Workup for secondary causes was negative. MRI and CT scans confirmed symmetric calcifications in the globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and thalami bilaterally. Subsequently obtained brain CT scan of mother (asymptomatic) showed a similar pattern of calcifications, prompting genetic workup. A variant was found in the SLC20A2 gene, c.935-2 A>G that has not been seen at the testing lab nor documented previously; it occurs in a splice site preceding an exon, and is therefore highly suspicious to be pathogenic. Further testing of other family members revealed similar calcifications in brain, carotid vessels, and testicles (first son, asymptomatic); calcifications in carotids, heart, femoral arteries (second son, history of MI age 35), workup pending in other sibling.

We found two novel mutations/variations in one patient with atypical MSA and in one patient with an atypical phenotype of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). The former patient had clinically definite MSA parkinsonism type (MSA-P) without a typical MRI abnormality and also had an intermediate repeat expansion in the SCA2 gene, a finding associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The latter with SCA6 had major incontinence. A previously found variation linked to susceptibility to MSA, p.Val393Ala, was also detected in this study with a significantly higher frequency in MSA (6/47, 12.8%) than in controls (7/200, 3.5%). This variation was additionally found in a patient with unclassified ataxia with juvenile-onset myoclonus and mental impairment, one with atypical SCA8, and one with typical SCA31. Cultured fibroblasts from patients with COQ2-variation-positive/negative MSA were susceptible to oxidative stress and were partially protected by COQ10.

Palo Alto, CA PROSC (proline synthetase co-transcribed bacterial homolog) encodes a binding protein involved in successful function of the cofactor pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6. Here we describe a 2 month old male presenting with a new-onset movement disorder, characterized by dystonias, opisthotonus and oculogyric crises. Continuous video electroencephalogram was performed and revealed multiple epileptiform discharges; however his abnormal movements did not correlate with electrographic seizures. The patients clinical phenotype, taken together with his biochemical profile of elevated urine vanillactic acid and increased 3-methoxytyrosine in cerebrospinal fluid, closely resembled the known entity AADC (aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase) deficiency. He was initially treated with levodopa-carbidopa, B6 and PLP, and clinical symptoms resolved. Plasma AADC enzymatic function was tested and found to be reduced, but not absent. This result suggested at least partial functioning of the AADC enzyme, atypical of previously described AADC deficiency cases. Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous mutation in the PROSC gene, which has recently been found in a small number of patients with B6 and/or PLP-responsive epilepsy (Darin et al., 2016) . Levodopa-carbidopa and antiepileptic medications were discontinued in our patient, and he continued receiving B6 and PLP therapies without reemergence of symptoms. Electroencephalogram was repeated and found to be normal; most notably, previously seen epileptiform activity was absent. The enzymatic pathways involved in mammalian B6/PLP synthesis and homeostasis are reviewed, and we discuss a novel, potential role of the PROSC protein in PLP function. Alpha-synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by alpha-synuclein inclusions in neurons and glia. The role of glia in these diseases is poorly understood.",

Boston, MA and Durham, NC Advances in gene and biologic therapies will revolutionize the management of neurodegenerative disorders, including genetic ataxias such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Friedreich ataxia, and the spinocerebellar ataxias (Scoles, Nature, 2017). Clinical trials require sensitive, specific, and objective behavioral biomarkers to prove efficacy and to support early diagnosis and enrollment of patients (prior to neurodegeneration). Oculomotor abnormalities are prominent and early features of the genetic ataxias (Stephen, Neurology, 2017) . Here we demonstrate the ability to detect abnormalities from automated analysis of eye motion video captured with the Apple iPhone high-speed camera. Using computer vision (Xiong, IEEE, 2013) and signal processing algorithms applied to video data, we were able to detect abnormalities in smooth pursuit, saccades, and fixation in patients with cerebellar ataxias when compared with controls. This work demonstrates the feasibility of capturing important eye movement information using an inexpensive and widely accessible technology, while only requiring four minutes of testing time. Further development of this technology may provide a useful tool for screening for ataxias in resource-limited areas, without access to an expert, and for objectively and quantitatively measuring response to novel therapies over time without necessarily requiring a clinic visit. Methods: We investigated neurofilament light protein (NfL) in blood as a potential biomarker in HD in the 3-year, 366-participant international TRACK-HD cohort. In a separate 37-participant cohort, we quantified NfL in CSF and plasma.",

Ann Arbor, MI Striatal dopamine depletion causes key motor features of Parkinson Disease (PD), but the functional role(s) of dopamine in motor control remain unclear. Reduced movement velocity in PD patients suggests that striatal dopamine regulates movement vigor, while other evidence suggests that dopamine influences implicit learning by encoding prediction errors. To explore which mechanism is relevant for parkinsonian bradykinesia, we tested whether suppressing dopamine neurotransmission during a repetitive reaching task progressively degrades skilled performance, as expected for a learning mechanism, or simply slows movement, as expected for a vigor mechanism. We accomplished this by employing real-time high-speed video analysis to trigger optogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons selectively during reach-to-grasp movements in highly trained rats. We find that acutely inhibiting dopamine neurons disrupts reaching movements by impairing digit closure around a reward pellet and slowing or preventing pellet withdrawal. This deficit was not progressive and performance returned to baseline immediately upon stopping dopamine neuron suppression. These results suggest that dopamine primarily modulates action vigor in a dexterous task homologous to human reach-to-grasp movements. Ongoing work is directed towards dissecting how the timing of dopamine neuron suppression within individual trials affects reach-to-grasp movements. Background: Spasticity results in negative consequences and quality of life but is often left untreated; one impediment to care is under-recognition. There is no definitive method or independent biomarker to diagnose spasticity.",

A positive JCV antibody titer is the most commonly used biological marker for evaluating the risk of developing PML, with higher antibody index values signifying greater risk.

Introduction: Subventricular zone (SVZ) is a germinal zone not only for neural progenitors (NPCs), but also for oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), which subsequently migrate towards the corpus callosum (CC) and cortex. Recent studies showed that SVZ-derived progenitors contribute to myelin repair in various pathologic conditions. Cuprizoneinduced demyelination is characterized by increased production but delayed maturation of OPCs. Since OPCs are partially derived from neurogenic niche, we hypothesize that neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis are inversely related and correlated with the extent of myelin loss.",

We found that astrocytic CLDN-4 (a structural TJ protein) and JAM-A (a combined TJ and cell adhesion protein) exert distinct and opposing effects on cell trafficking into the CNS parenchyma and on clinical disability.",

            "text": "Design/Methods: To selectively delete CLDN-4 and JAM-A from reactive astrocytes, conditional knock-out (CKO) mouse lines were created by crossing mGFAP:Cre mice with Cldn-4fl/fl and JAM-Afl/fl mice. Two models of CNS inflammatory disease were induced in single CKOs, double CKOs and controls: 1) cortical injections of adenovirally mediated IL-1 and 2) experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Lesion size, leukocyte and soluble factor entry, neuronal death and demyelination were measured in both models, as well as clinical disability in EAE. Results: Cldn-4 CKO mice showed increased CNS parenchymal infiltration of leukocytes in these two models of inflammatory disease, whereas JAM-A CKO mice showed accumulation of leukocytes within the perivascular spaces. In EAE, Cldn-4 CKOs showed exacerbated disability while JAM-A CKOs showed a milder disease course than controls. Conclusions: Reactive astrocytes upregulate TJ proteins, CLDN-4 and JAM-A, which have unique effects on leukocyte trafficking into the inflamed CNS, as well as opposing effects on clinical disability in a model of MS. Therefore, reactive astrocytes expresses cell surface proteins that bidirectionally modulate CNS inflammation. Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often ask if diet could influence their MS. Intermittent fasting or calorie restriction may provide additional anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective advantages beyond the positive benefits obtained from weight loss alone. In the mouse forms of MS, fasting delays the onset of the disease, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration. However, data in humans are lacking.",

Philadelphia, PA Background: A decrease in lymphocyte counts over time is a known side effect of treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a commonly used therapy in MS patients. More dramatic declines have been observed in some patients, and in some T-cell lines, than others. Lymphopenia with the use of dimethyl fumarate is a risk factor for developing complications such as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is caused by JC virus in the brain, presumed to be a reactivation of a latent infection. Testing exists to understand a host's prior exposure or mounted immune response against JCV. JCV antibody testing is used to help assess the risk of PML with the use of other drugs. This retrospective review of medical records from patients at the Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Pennsylvania aimed to better assess the effects of DMF treatment on counts of specific T-lymphocyte populations and to concurrently catalogue JCV antibody testing results over time in these patients. We examined if there was a correlation between DMF use and the duration or characterization of lymphopenia and if lymphopenic patients were more prone to changes in JC virus antibody status.",

K. pneumoniae also increased in number (from 14.0 isolates/year to 52.3 isolates/year) with the first imipenemresistance detected in 2013 and remained at a low proportion (2.5%). S. aureus maintained a steadily high occurrence (93.3 isolates/year) with relatively high oxacillin-resistance (76.7%). P. aeruginosa showed little change over time in isolate numbers (29.3 isolates/year) and drug resistance.",

This study is continuing to enroll patients to help determine whether NIRS monitoring may help determine better blood pressure targets following thrombectomy. Although metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a promising approach for broad-based detection of microorganisms, it has yet to be applied in the clinical setting for diagnosis and management of patients with unknown infectious syndromes. Here we present the implementation of a clinically validated mNGS assay for pathogen identification from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for use in the diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis. In June of 2016, we launched the PDAID (\"Precision Diagnosis of Acute Infectious Diseases\") study, a nationwide, one-year prospective study at 8 academic hospitals across the U.S. to evaluate the clinical utility and comparative effectiveness of the mNGS assay relative to conventional microbiological testing. Over the first 9 months of the study, we enrolled 151 patients, adults and children, presenting with acute meningitis, acute encephalitis, or an acute exacerbation of a chronic meningitis. Inclusion criteria included (1) unknown diagnosis at time of enrollment, (2) CSF pleocytosis or abnormal neuroimaging suggestive of an infectious etiology, and (3) acute presentation with time of enrollment within 7 days of symptom onset. Samples were processed and analyzed within 1 week of receipt in the clinical microbiology laboratory, with a sample-to-answer assay turnaround time of $72 hours. Clinical microbial sequencing boards were convened by realtime teleconferencing once a week to discuss mNGS results with treating physicians in a clinical context. mNGS identified a neurologic infection in 35 of 151 patients (23.2%). More than one-third (n512, 34.2%) of the infections detected by mNGS would not have been detected by conventional testing. These infections include the first documented case of St. Louis encephalitis virus in CA since 1986, human coronavirus 229E which has not previously been described in neuroinvasive disease, the first reported case of hepatitis E virus transmitted by a lung transplant donor and previously missed cases of Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida tropicalis, and Neisseria meningitides meningitis. Excluding cases of infections diagnosed only by serology (West Nile virus (n53), neurosyphilis (n52), dengue (n51), and Baylisascaris procyonis (n51)), the mNGS assay had 88.5% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity relative to conventional testing. These data show that an unbiased metagenomic assay for infectious disease diagnosis is clinically useful in clarifying diagnosis in a significant proportion of patients with acute meningitis and encephalitis. The outcome of hospitalized patients with neurologic diseases varies from complications during the hospital course. Hospital-acquired infections account for large proportion of these complications, and urinary tract infection is the most common infection in hospitalized patients.",

K. pneumoniae isolates dramatically increased in number (from 6.33/year in 2006-2008 to 27/year in 2014-2016) Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is a debilitating chronic progressive myopathy characterized by a combination of autoimmune and degenerative characteristics that contribute to the disease pathogenesis. Pro-inflammatory CD28null T cells have been shown to be the dominant T cell subset in both the peripheral blood and in the inflamed muscles of patients with sIBM. These T cells display a strong pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic phenotype and are believed to play a role in the muscle fiber destruction. T cell activation depends upon a calcium-signaling cascade that is regulated by voltage-gated potassium channels, providing a specific potential drug target. Dalazatide is a potent, highly specific inhibitor of Kv1.3, a potassium channel required for activation of effector memory T (TEM) cells. A key differentiating feature of dalazatide is that it specifically targets chronically activated TEM cells which rely on Kv1.3 expression for their effector function, while leaving other T cell subsets which upregulate KCa3.1 upon activation intact, thus providing an immune sparing profile. Dalazatide has demonstrated potent inhibition of TEM cells in numerous in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of autoimmune disorders, and has successfully completed three Phase 1 clinical studies demonstrating safety in both healthy volunteers and in patients with plaque psoriasis. In addition, relevant T cell engagement and proof of concept efficacy was observed. Here we show through immunohistochemistry analysis that muscle biopsy samples from patients with sIBM display CD31 T cells in the perivascular space and in the muscle fibers, which express the Kv1.3 channel. Ongoing studies are underway to characterize the T cell population in the blood of patients with sIBM and evaluate ex vivo inhibition with dalazatide. Dalazatide inhibition of Kv1.3 may be a safe and attractive strategy for treating sIBM, for which there are no currently approved therapeutics.",

Mutations in the gene coding for myelin protein zero (MPZ, P0) are associated with different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. We describe a family harboring a frameshift mutation (c.306delA/p.Asp104ThrfsTer14) in the P0 gene, predicted to result in a nonfunctional P0 truncated very early in the extracellular domain. This offered the rare opportunity to assess the consequences P0 deficiency in absence of the potential gain-of-function effects of the mutations itself. Conventional conduction studies and multiple measures of nerve excitability by \"threshold tracking\" were carried out in 2 heterozygote parents (aged 63 and 52) and their two homozygote sons (aged 31 and 39). In the homozygous patients, all distal limb CMAPs and SNAPs were absent. For neurophysiological assessment, the spinal accessory nerve was stimulated at the neck and CMAP was recorded over the upper trapezius muscle. Eight normal subjects, mean age 34, were used as control. The two sibs showed a severe phenotype with early onset, severe scoliosis, complete loss of distal movements and relevant proximal weakness, CMT Examination Score (CMTES) 23-25/28; both heterozygous parents had very mild adult-onset neuropathy with CMTES <4/28. Control subjects had a trapezius CMAP with a latency of 6.2 ms and an amplitude of 7.4 mV. Heterozygotes had a mild CMT type 1B phenotype, with a CMAP latency of 7.5 ms and an amplitude of 2.9 mV whereas the homozygotes had a severe neuropathy with a CMAP latency of 35.9 ms and an amplitude of 0.2 mV. Consistently, the homozygotes had a more severe impairment in excitability with a rheobase of 16.2 mA as compared to 4.7 mA in the heterozygote and 3.5 mA in controls. Deviations in excitability measures were similar to our previous reports in P01/-and P0-/-mice. Mathematical modeling, indicated both altered passive cable properties due to dysmyelination and depolarizing features with increased Na1 currents. Our data suggest that P0 deficiency is associated with impaired axonal Na1 channel function, arguing for the translational value of Na1 channel blocker treatments as found in P0 null mouse models.

Rochester, MN Peripheral neuropathy is a common debilitating clinical problem with many etiologies, yet the precise pathophysiology of peripheral nerve damage is poorly understood. We have adopted an approach of using human patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) samples differentiated into sensory neurons (iSN) to study \"neuropathy-in-a-dish,\" focusing on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Skin fibroblasts from Mayo Clinic patient volunteers have been collected and stored at the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine's BioTrust. In our growing library, there are now either fibroblast or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) samples from >100 healthy controls and >70 patients with CMT, many of which have known genotypes. iPSCs were reprogrammed using Sendai virus and Yamanaka factors (oct4, sox2, klf4 and c-myc) and quality control was done to verify pluripotency of iPSCs (immunostaining and PCR for oct4, nanog, ssea3/4, tra-1-60; karyotyping; germ layer differentiation). Neural crest stem cells were derived from iPSCs based on a previously established small molecule protocol and were seeded into microfluidic chambers and subsequently differentiated into iSN. iSN differentiation was confirmed utilizing real time PCR for sensory neuron gene expression, immunostaining to verify protein levels, and patch clamp electrophysiology. iSN then were treated with paclitaxel (0, 10 and 100uM) for 24-48 hours and dosedependent axonal damage of labeled axons was observed and quantified using image J. By studying iSN within microfluidic chambers, we now are able to separate distal axonal neurotoxicity and neuropathology from that occurring in the somatic region. This unique patient-derived neuropathy-in-a-dish model will be used going forward for detailed mechanistic studies of pathogenesis and neuroprotection for CIPN and CMT. The pathogenesis of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is unknown. One myopathologic feature in sIBM is a rimmed vacuole (RV). RVs contain aggregated proteins that accumulate within myofibers and in many cases are amyloidogenic. We hypothesize that the identification of proteins that accumulate within RVs will reveal pathomechanistic insight into sIBM. Using laser microdissected RVs from skeletal muscle of 18 sIBM patients and matched controls, we performed mass spectrometry using label-free spectral count-based relative protein quantification. With this approach, we identified 213 proteins that were enriched by > 1.5 fold in RVs compared to controls samples. These proteins included proteins previously reported to accumulate in sIBM tissue or when mutated cause myopathies with RVs. Several categories of proteins were present; with the largest groups being those associated with protein folding and autophagy. In a second tiered approach, we performed whole exome sequencing on 62 patients with sIBM and identifed the burden of rare missense coding variants in RV associated proteins. This strategy identifed FYCO1, an autophagic adaptor protein not previously identified in or associated with sIBM. Rare missense coding FYCO1 variants were present in 11.3% of sIBM patients compared with 2.6% of controls (p50.003). FYCO1 colocalized at RVs with autophagic proteins such as MAP1LC3 and SQSTM1 in sIBM and other RV myopathies. One FYCO1 variant protein had reduced colocalization with MAP1LC3 when expressed in mouse muscle. This study used an unbiased proteomic approach to identify RV proteins in sIBM that included a novel protein involved in sIBM pathogenesis. Specifically, FYCO1 accumulates at RVs, and rare missense variants in FYCO1 are over-represented in sIBM patients. These FYCO1 variants may impair autophagic function, leading to RV formation in sIBM patient muscle. FYCO1 functionally connects autophagic and endocytic pathways, supporting the hypothesis that impaired endolysosomal degradation underlies the pathogenesis of sIBM. Background: While extraocular muscles are affected early in generalised Myasthenia Gravis (MG) with acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-antibodies, we have identified a subphenotype of treatment-resistant ophthalmoplegia (OP-MG). These patients most frequently have African-genetic ancestry and juvenile-onset MG. A candidate approach identified 2 African-specific gene traits linked to OP-MG, decay accelerating factor (DAF) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1). We speculate that OP-MG may result from aberrant responses in muscle damage/repair pathways, although the pathogenesis is unknown. Performing extended whole exome sequencing (WES) in an extreme sample of OP-MG vs control MG individuals, we discovered four potentially pathogenic gene variants relevant in extraocular muscle pathways. Three were sequence validated in an independent sample.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Dyspnea in SPS is common, and occurs both at rest and with exertion. Many patients show a restrictive spirometry pattern, and there is some association between simple measures of dyspnea and pulmonary function. We postulate that chest wall constriction and/or superimposed spasm of the muscles of the trunk may be the underlying mechanism leading to the sensation of dyspnea and objective respiratory compromise. Potential involvement of diaphragmatic muscles is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that positively-charged oligo-polyethylene glycol fumarate (OPF1) hydrogel scaffolds implanted after complete thoracic spinal cord transection in rats facilitate a permissive regenerative environment by reducing scarring, and that there is a close relationship between new blood vessel formation and the number of regenerating axons. In this study we used multichannel OPF1 hydrogel scaffolds to provide a platform to control the micro-environment of the regenerating spinal cord. Our objective was to assess the spatial relationships between blood vessel formation and axonal regeneration in the core area of scaffold channels eight weeks after implantation. Poly-lacticco-glycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres were embedded within Schwann cell (SC)-loaded OPF1 scaffolds for sustained release of the anti-fibrotic and immunosuppressant drug rapamycin. Animals were implanted with spinal cord scaffolds containing Matrigel alone (n55), SCs plus empty PLGA microspheres (n56), or SCs plus rapamycin-eluting microspheres (n56). Stereologic methods were applied to measure core channel area, blood vessel number, volume, diameter, intervessel distances, total vessel surface and cross-sectional areas, and radial diffusion distances in each group. Neurolucida software, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging were used to perform a Sholl analysis to count a total of 2,494 myelinated and 4,173 unmyelinated axons at 10 micron circumferential intervals around 708 individual blood vessel profiles within scaffold channels. Patterns in the Gaussian distribution of axons with respect to their distance from and density around blood vessels were measured. Despite an equivalent number of new blood vessels in each group, axon number and surface density in the SC group exceeded that seen in the Matrigel and SC plus rapamycin animal groups. Higher axonal densities correlated with smaller vessel crosssectional areas (Spearman r 5 20.1431, p50.0257). Axons in each group were concentrated within a concentric distance of 200 microns from the blood vessel wall, but were excluded from a 25 micron zone immediately adjacent to the vessel. Finally we used a statistical spatial algorithm to generate cumulative distribution functions of vessels and axons within each scaffold channel type. Whereas axons around vessels were definitively clustered, blood vessels themselves were distributed randomly within scaffold channels. Our results further refine spinal cord tissue engineering strategies to optimize the regeneration of complete neurovascular bundles in their relevant spatial relationships.",

Ann Arbor, MI Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating illness which results in progressive degeneration of the motor neurons. There is currently no cure and treatment options are incredibly limited. Previous studies have demonstrated that the immune system plays a dual role in ALS pathogenesis: it can protect against or exacerbate neuronal damage. It is therefore critically important to determine the role of specific immune cell populations during the course of disease. However, despite strong evidence that the immune system plays a significant role in ALS pathogenesis, clinical studies have yet to identify a viable immune target in ALS patients. Our data indicate that numerous immune populations are increased in ALS patients compared to healthy controls. By tracking patients over multiple visits to the clinic and utilizing multivariate regression analysis, we are able to show that changes in several cell populations correlates with disease progression. In particular, increases in total numbers of neutrophils and decreases in CD4 T cell levels are closely tied with rapid disease progression. In addition, we find that the number of natural killer cells increases dramatically during the early stages of disease. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the immune system plays a central role in ALS pathogenesis and that peripheral immunity may be a viable therapeutic target. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and no effective treatments currently exist. We have evidence demonstrating that PN which manifests in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice can be completely corrected through a paradigm of dietary reversal (DR). As HFD-fed mice more closely represent a model of impaired glucose tolerance/prediabetes rather than T2D, it is unclear whether DR can similarly benefit patients with frank T2D. Therefore, we investigated the effects of DR on PN in HFD-fed mice injected with streptozotocin (STZ), a model described by Yorek MS et al. (2014) which more accurately resembles a T2D phenotype.",

This study supports the premise that dietary intervention is a feasible strategy to improve peripheral nerve health in patients with both pre-diabetes and T2D. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common and debilitating complication of obesity and diabetes that triggers pain and loss of sensation. Substantial nerve damage occurs in many patients prior to noticeable symptoms and no treatments are currently available; therefore, there is a critical need to identify treatment strategies that impact the underlying disease pathogenesis. Our in vivo fluxomics data in the BKS-db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and PN suggest that 'metabolic reprogramming' occurs in the T2DM nerve to downregulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of substrates derived from glycolysis and fatty acid beta-oxidation. We therefore hypothesize that distinct systemic metabolic alterations occur in obesity and diabetes which induce tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming within the peripheral nerve, altering fuel utilization and ultimately leading to tissue dysfunction. We contend that identifying conserved bioenergetic profiles across mouse models of PN will provide insight into key PN mechanisms. The current study utilized two mouse models of PN: the 60% High Fat Diet (HFD) mouse model of obesity and prediabetes at 20 wk of age (16 wk HFD), and the leptin receptor-deficient BKSdb/db model of T2DM at 24 wk of age. Mitochondrial function was determined in primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and sural nerve tissue from both models using the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer. Resting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism was upregulated in DRG neurons from mice with PN, with increased resting ATP production and maintained mitochondrial coupling. In contrast, resting ATP generation was decreased in sural nerve from mice with PN, with decreased coupling efficiency. Relative spare respiratory capacity was attenuated in both DRG neurons and sural nerve from mice with PN, indicating that mitochondria were less able to increase respiration in response to an energetic challenge. Moreover, mitochondrial copy number was unchanged in DRG neurons, but decreased in sural nerve tissue of mice with PN compared with respective controls. These data suggest a change in absolute number and function of sural nerve mitochondria, and a conserved cross-model proximal-distal bioenergetic profile in PN. We are currently exploring the relationship between these changes and PN pathogenesis.

Additionally, central or peripheral intracellular accumulation with passive transbilayer diffusion and active transport with poor efflux protein activity of levofloxacin may cause chemosensory damage. Moreover, hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion via glucoronidation are routes of elimination for fluoroquinolones, thus levofloxacin has limited clearance. Excess drug may precipitate toxicity based on the above mechanisms. In conclusion, fluoroquinolones should be used cautiously due to a multitude of side effects. The data warrants inquiry of levofloxacin induced hyposmia and hypogeusia. Hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening disease. Currently, the only medication approved for treatment of hATTR amyloidosis is tafamidis, but its approval is limited to select countries outside the US. Diflunisal, a NSAID shown to prevent dissociation of TTR tetramers, and doxycycline, a TTR fibril disrupter, are sometimes used off-label for hATTR amyloidosis. Patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting hepatic TTR production, is being studied in an ongoing Phase 3 study which has completed enrollment. The objective of this abstract is to highlight demographics of patients approved for the EAP who were receiving diflunisal and/or doxycycline prior to requesting access to patisiran and the reasons for the request.",

Challenges of the neurologic exam include the subjectivity and reproducibility of testing sensation due to the psychophysiological nature of the assessments. To quantify the reliability of a standard sensory examination, 127 patients (average age 53.3, SD 12.7, 41.7% female) were prospectively examined by neuromuscular neurology practitioners using a traditional 165 Hz tuning fork, a numerical Rydel-Seiffer (RS) tuning fork, or both. Vibratory loss was defined as a score less than 21.5 on the 4 point Mayo Clinic scale (05normal, 22550% loss, 245anesthesia) with a 165 Hz tuning fork, or less than 6 for an upper extremity or less than 4 on a lower extremity using a RS tuning fork. Subsequent testing included sensory nerve conduction studies (NCS), quantitative sensory testing (QST), or both to be used as gold-standard measurements of sensory dysfunction. For NCS, abnormality was defined as median or sural nerve sensory action potential amplitude less than 100% of agematched control normal values, and for QST abnormality was greater than or equal to the 95th percentile. Using sensory NCS as a gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the 165 Hz tuning fork for detecting vibratory loss were 28.9% and 98.7% respectively, whereas for the RS tuning fork values were 45.5% and 90%, respectively. Using QST as a gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the 165 Hz tuning fork for detecting vibratory loss was 18.3% and 97.4%, respectively, whereas for the RS tuning fork values were 32.6% and 85.0%, respectively. Compared to the 165 Hz tuning fork, the RS tuning fork showed a trend toward greater sensitivity, but this was not statistically significant (p 5 0.065 with NCS, p 5 0.289 with QST). With sensory NCS as a gold-standard, the accuracy of the 165 Hz tuning fork and the RS tuning forks were similar, 75.9% and 74.2%, respectively (p 5 1.0). Preliminary data suggests both tuning forks have low sensitivity for detecting vibratory sensory loss, but high specificity. Ongoing analysis will study these comparisons further, assess sensitivity and specificity values by examiner, and investigate the reliability of bedside testing for pain (pin prick) and temperature compared with sensory NCS and QST.",

            "text": "Gene Is Associated with an Axonal Polyneuropathy Michael Wang, Ryan Castoro, Megan Simmons, Bo Hu and Jun Li. Nashville, TN AIFM1 (apoptosis-inducing factor, mitochondrion-associated-1) has captured great attention from biomedical researchers due its critical role in the regulation of cell apoptosis. This flavoprotein is typically located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it is associated with respiratory chain complex-I. Upon a cell-death insult, AIFM1 is cleaved into a 57Kd protein that is released into the cytosol. The 57Kd peptide may enter the nucleus to trigger chromosome condensation and fragmentation, initiating a caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis. However, this nuclear translocation may be blocked by cytosolic Heat-Shock Protein-70 (HSP70) that binds with the FAD domain (aa 150 -228) of AIFM1. Mutations in AIFM1 gene have resulted in several clinical phenotypes, including a family with CMTX4 (Glu493Val). Clinical deficits in these patients usually involve multiple organs. In this study however, we identified a family with a novel missense mutation (Phe210Leu) in AIFM1 that developed a late-onset sensory motor axonal polyneuropathy by nerve conduction criteria. The proband and affected siblings exhibited distal muscle weakness and atrophy with normal cognitive and cranial nerve functions. There was no obvious phenotype from other organs. Interestingly, this Phe210Leu mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid at the center of the FAD domain. We hypothesize that this mutation impairs the binding between AIFM1 and HSP70, leading to an enhancement of cell-death signaling. This family therefore provides a unique opportunity to explore how altered apoptotic signaling affects the peripheral nerve system.

Introduction: Recently, a prospective trial looking at the use of ultrasound in the assessment of focal neuropathy detected improvement in several outcomes when ultrasound was performed, one being the SF-36 (Cartwright et al., 2015) . This study randomized 120 patients with focal neuropathies to either have their ultrasound reports sent or not sent to their management teams. Based on this published data, we calculated Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) data by extracting the SF-6D scores, a preference-based health related quality of life (HR-QOL) index, from the original SF-36 scores. This information was used to statistically assess whether the originally reported improvement attributed to the use of diagnostic ultrasound extended to a preference-based HR-QOL score such as the SF-6D, as measured in QALYs.",

In addition to the positive outcomes found in the original study, this result further supports the efficacy of diagnostic ultrasound in focal neuropathy with a measure that can integrate both quality and quantity of life. Such a measure can be applied in future research into the cost effectiveness of diagnostic ultrasound in focal neuropathy. Purpose: Weakness of the arm caused by any non-progressive insult to the peripheral, or occasionally central, nervous system may be amenable to nerve transfer surgery to reverse that weakness. Nerve transfer involves cutting a redundant nerve, or fascicle from a neighboring healthy nerve, and transferring these functioning axons to the nerve branch supplying the paralyzed muscle. These transferred axons then regenerate into the new target, restoring function of that muscle. This field is little known among medical practitioners in general, but an impressive degree of functionality can often be restored. Too often, peripheral nerve injuries are referred after a long delay. When this delay is greater than a year the patient may miss the opportunity to benefit from these procedures and therefore fail to regain meaningful function. This pilot study aims to advance evaluation of patients considered for nerve transfer surgery and stimulate much needed further research and discussion regarding neurophysiologic evaluation to determine candidacy for nerve transfer surgery. We evaluated whether the degree of innervation in a donor nerve as assessed by quantitative electromyography predicted outcome of nerve transfer surgery as measured by hand-held manometry.",

In our patient calculated nerve elongation due to displacement by giant masses was expected to produce significant neurological dysfunction. However, he presented with minimal neurological symptoms suggesting different mechanisms in chronic versus acute injury. Although both events cause nerve traction/compression, it is likely that adaptive and remodeling processes differentiate functional outcome in slow injury, where there is greater potential for neural plasticity and preservation of peripheral nerve function. This case represents the tremendous potential of neural plasticity and nerve adaptability of the peripheral nervous system. We present a very rare case that demonstrates the extremes at which peripheral nerves can adapt after injuries. This case demonstrates that duration of injury is crucial in determining the outcome of nerve function. A better understanding of differences in mechanisms in acute versus chronic injury at the basic science level can help in developing translation clinical approaches. The findings from this case have the potential to contribute in our understanding in the development of clinical neurological disciplines of neurorehabilitation and sports neurology.

The 12-, 24-, and 36-month OS rates were 66.9%, 35.4%, and 24.1%, respectively. 85% of patients who were alive at OStime530 months went on to survive to 36 months. Analyzing our data out to 36 months, the OStime(ASmax) was found to be 32 months, i.e. patients who were alive at OStime532 months had a 87% probability of surviving an additional 6 months to a total OS of 38 months. Using the recent tumor treating fields (TTFields) study [Stupp, JAMA 2015] as a comparison, we noted that in order to validate such a conditional probability-based endpoint approach, the P(AS|OS) has to be high (>70%) at OStime530 months and must remain high in a plateau-like fashion (65%) for the 6-month period preceding OStime530 months (i.e. OStime 5 24-30 months) Conclusion: It should be possible to perform a successful trial with a limited number of patients (approximately 30). For example, if the goal of a novel experimental therapy were set to achieve a 48% 36-month OS rate (double that of our series), this could be tested without a placebo/control group. The trial could be stopped at 30 months after the last patient is enrolled declaring the therapy successful if 56.5% of patients (i.e. 48% 4 85%) remain alive at the 30-month OStime.",

Boston, MA Background: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is an approved modality of treatment for glioblastoma. Patient anatomy-based finite element analysis (FEA) has the potential to reveal not only how these fields affect tumor control but also how they can be optimized to improve efficacy. Historically, models for FEA has been created with manual segmentation by an expert familiar with intracranial neuroanatomical structures. But this method is time-consuming, financially costly, and variable between experts. While the availability of tools for segmenting MRIs obviates some of these obstacles, creating FEA models requires manual adjustments including removal of disconnected voxels, incorporation of unsegmented structures that may alter the electric field, and addition of 36 electrodes matching those of the transducers on the scalp. Existing approaches are also not scalable to a large number of patient MRI scans. A semiautomated workflow was developed to address these concerns.",

Here we show that Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and AhR target genes are functionally expressed on GSCs. Activating AhR is sufficient to increase the self-renewal capacity of CSC, the canonical gene expression of CYP1A1 and other AhR targets on GSCs. In contrast, inhibition of AhR leads to a decrease of self-renewal capacity and AhR targets genes. We showed that putative AhR genes increase during GSC differentiation and can be targeted at both the GSCs and differentiated stages of tumor progression in vitro. Using a novel \"reporter\" organoid model of glioblastoma from GSCs carrying OLIG2-GFP-Luc dual transcriptional reporters, we demonstrated that AhR inhibition decreases proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduce the size of the organoids and the expression of OLIG2. Furthermore, increasing the apoptotic niches in the organoids. Using a complementary approach, we demonstrated that AhR knockdown in GSCs induced loss of self-renewal with increased in p53 phosphorylation. Implantation of AhR deficient human GSCs leads to a decrease in tumor size and survival advantage in mice. Furthermore, using microarray gene expression analysis of patient-derived organoids, we established the molecular programs affected by targeting AhR in these organoids, corresponded to genes related to stemness and inflammation that are independently associated with survival. Our findings established the functional expression of AhR in GSC as critical to maintaining tumor growth and self-renewal in vivo and in a patient-derived model of glioblastoma during two critical stages of tumorogenesis. Our results indicate that tumor derived-organoids can be used as a preclinical predictive model to study the molecular vulnerabilities of tumors to distinct candidate therapies in a given patient, toward personalized Neuro-Oncology.",

Use of nSOREMPs mildly increased the DSM-V diagnosis of narcolepsy compared with ICSD-3 criteria. nSOREMPs were more prevalent in NT1 than NT2 patients. Autism spectrum disorders are prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders with great societal cost; however, treatment options remain parsimonious due to limited understanding of the underlying molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms. We have recently demonstrated in a mouse model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, that cerebellar specific dysfunction is sufficient to generate autistic-like behaviors. To better understand the cerebellar topography governing the cerebellar regulation of these ASD-relevant behaviors, we identified abnormalities in a clinically-implicated region in our cerebellar ASD mouse model. In addition, we have demonstrated that inhibition of this cerebellar domain is sufficient to generate social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, we have demonstrated that stimulation of this domain is sufficient to rescue abnormal behaviors in our cerebellar ASD mouse model, even into adulthood, thereby demonstrating the potential for cerebellar neuromodulation-based therapies in the treatment of abnormal ASD behaviors. We further explore the cerebellar -cortical circuits regulated by this domains to better understand the circuit networks involved in ASD behaviors and to identify additional therapeutic targets for neural circuit-based therapeutic development.",

New York and Taipei, Taiwan Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorders, affecting 4% of individuals aged 40 years or older. The mechanism of ET remains unclear, mainly due to the lack of chronic tremor animal model. Previously, we discovered that climbing fiber (CF) synaptic pathology in the postmortem ET cerebellum (i.e. the invasion of CFs into the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic territory on the Purkinje cell dendrites). Here we reported that GluRdelta2-insufficient mice (hotfoot 17J) also had ET-like CF pathology and developed 20Hz tremor. Similar to ET, the characteristics of mouse tremor was kinetic-predominant, adult onset and worsening with aging. The ET-like tremor in mice responded to ET-medications, including primidone, propranolol and alcohol. Since GluRdelta2 is a Purkinje cellspecific molecule, our study demonstrated that ET-like tremor could be generated from the cerebellar cortex with hyper-innervated CFs. Therefore, we uncovered a major mechanism of ET and also provided a disease model to study cerebellar motor functions, with evidence that can be mutually referenced between mouse and human at the molecular (GluRdelta2), pathological (CF wirings) and behavioral (tremor) levels.",

            "text": "The collagen VI related muscular dystrophies (COL6-RD) are inherited disorders of collagen VI characterized by progressive muscle weakness and a combination of distal joint laxity and proximal joint contractures. Phenotypic heterogeneity is a hallmark of COL6-RD with a spectrum of severity in patients from the very severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) to the milder Bethlem myopathy (BM). Factors controlling severity in COL6-RD patients are largely unknown, however, patients with identical mutations can have the full spectrum of phenotypes, suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that LTBP4, a regulator of TGF-b signaling which has been shown to influence severity Duchenne muscular dystrophy, can also modify severity in COL6-RD by testing for association of LTPB4 haplotype with major markers of clinical progression in COL6-RD including time to loss of ambulation in a large cohort of comprehensively phenotyped patients. These studies provide critical insights into the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in patients with COL6-RD, identify targets for the development of therapies, and provide an important model for future studies of the molecular pathogenesis. Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is one of the most common and intractable symptoms of diabetes, affecting 25% of diabetic patients. The hallmarks of PDN are neuropathic pain and small-fiber degeneration, the loss of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor axons. In states of neuropathic pain, DRG nociceptors become responsive to a variety of excitatory influences, including inflammatory cytokines. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to DRG nociceptors hyperexcitability and small-fiber degeneration in PDN are unknown.",

Furthermore, wild type TDP-43 RNP granules show distinct biophysical properties depending on their location along the axon. ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 granules display slower bleach recovery and increased viscosity compared to wild type TDP-43, indicating that the mutations alter the biophysical properties of the granules in neurons.

S100A9 deficiency decreases recruitment of neutrophils to the brain after sepsis. In sepsis survivor mice, microglia are primed to produce TNFa or reactive oxygen species. S100A9 deficiency abolishes priming of both ROS production and TNFa secretion in sepsis survivors. Taken together, these results indicate that S100A8/A9 contributes to several facets of neuroinflammation in sepsis survivor mice, including granulocyte recruitment and priming of microglial reactive oxygen species and cytokine production",

Boston, MA Background: [11C]-PBR28 is a radioligand that binds to TSPO expressed on activated glia.Methods: Fifty-three ALS, eleven PLS and twenty-one HC underwent simultaneous MR-PET using [11C]-PBR28. Demographics and clinical assessments including upper motor neuron burden (UMNB) and ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) were collected. Cortical thickness (CT), fractional anisotropy (FA) and PBR28 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were compared between the groups and correlated with the clinical measures.Results: Voxelwise, surface-based and ROI analyses revealed increased [11C]-PBR28 uptake in the motor cortices (MC) in ALS compared to HC (PFWE<0.05, PCW<0.05, P<0.05; respectively). The increase in [11C]-PBR28 uptake co-localized and correlated with decreased CT (r5-0.49; P<0.05) and reduced FA (r5-0.56;p<0.05). Glial activation correlated with higher UMNB (r50.53, P<0.05) and lower fine motor domain of ALSFRS-R (r5-0.33;P<0.05). There was no correlation between [11C]-PBR28 uptake and disease duration, or rate of progression. The correlation of [11C]-PBR28 uptake in the MC at baseline and six months was (r510.84;P50.0022).Interpretation: [11C]-PBR28 uptake is increased in the MC in people with ALS and PLS, co-localizes with structural abnormalities, and correlates with relevant clinical measures.[11C]-PBR28 uptake is remarkably stable over six months despite ALS progression.CD374.

Chicago, IL; Nashville, TN; Lusaka, Zambia; London, United Kingdom; Rochester, NY; Mazabuka, Zambia and Boston, MA Background: TBM is a devastating infection of the nervous system in Zambia, where $13% of the population is HIVinfected. Traditional diagnostic tests have low sensitivity or require several weeks for results. Xpert MTB/RIF is an automated, real-time PCR-based test that provides a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in $2 hours. LAM lateral flow assay has been used to evaluate disseminated TB in urine at the bedside. Both tests have the potential to expedite TBM diagnosis in resource-limited setting, but have not been fully evaluated in sub-Saharan Africa. CNS infection requiring lumbar puncture were enrolled at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Exclusion criteria included positive gram stain and cryptococcal antigen in the CSF. CSF samples underwent LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF testing. Urine samples underwent LAM testing only. Sensitivities and specificities of urine LAM, CSF LAM, and Xpert MTB/RIF were calculated using CSF MGIT TB liquid culture as the gold standard. RIF had a sensitivity of 54.9% for TBM; advantages include rapid and inexpensive testing, as well as immediate information about rifampicin resistance. While urine and CSF LAM exhibited low sensitivities, they may still be useful as cheap, rule-in, point-of-care tests in remote settings. CSF LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF were highly specific for TBM. Further analyses are currently being undertaken in this study to establish if the use of Xpert MTB/RIF affects inpatient mortality of TBM in Zambia. S228.

Taylor, Benjamin D. Bringadner, Cynthia A. Lary and Lisa H. Ranzinger. Charlotte, NC Background: The Brisbane-Sydney Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) -Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Disease Burden Scale employing limb scoring has identified that increasing LMN disease burden correlates inversely with survival cross-sectionally [Devine et al, 2015 ALSFTD 2016;17(3-4):184-90. doi: 10.3109/ 21678421.2015.1125502]. Use of this scale identified in a prospective natural history study that there was minimal LMN limb change in bulbar onset ALS patients over 12 months [Brooks et al, 2016 ALSFTD 2016; 17(Suppl. S1): 65-66 doi: 10.1080/21678421.2016.1231971/0090]. Objective: Modify the Brisbane-Sydney UMN -LMN ALS Disease Burden Scale to include clinimetric scaling in the bulbar region derived from UMN and LMN signs based on a novel orofacial [facial, lingual oropharyngeal] muscle strength LMN clinical scale and an assessment of orofacial, jaw and pharyngeal reflexes [glabellar, palmomental, root palmomental, pout, palate] and in the thoracic region based on trunk strength and deep abdominal reflexes. Methods: Clinical examinations were performed prospectively at 3 month intervals in 75 patients [21 bulbar Onset; 54 limb onset]. LMN and UMN signs were tabulated in each patient in each of four regions [bulbar, arm, trunk, legs] and transformed to a modified BATL UMN-LMN ALS Disease Burden Scale analyzing changes in all four anatomical regions. Results: Changes in the LMN scale components of the BATL UMN-LMN ALS Disease Burden Scale occur similarly in the bulbar onset and limb onset ALS patients unlike the lack of changes in the LMN scale in bulbar onset patients employing the Brisbane-Sydney UMN -LMN ALS Disease Burden Scale alone. Trunk LMN and UMN changes occur primarily in limb onset ALS patients over time. Conclusions: The BATL UMN-LMN ALS Disease Burden Scale displays comparable trajectories of UMN and LMN signs in bulbar onset and Limb onset ALS patients identifying a novel clinimetric scale for assessing the course of ALS in the clinic and in clinical trials.

Los Angeles, CA Objective: A retrospective study of MS patients with breakthrough disease on IM beta IFN-1a once per week (QW) switched to IM beta IFN-1a BIW Background: In some previous trials (PRISMS, EVI-DENCE, INCOMIN) there has been a suggestion of a dose response effect for beta IFN in MS. However, the European Interferon beta-1a Dose Comparison Study found no change in efficacy with just doubling the dose of IM beta IFN-1a QW. None of these previous studies have information on BIW IM beta IFN-1a or switching patients with breakthrough disease Design/Methods: 110 MS patients were started on IM beta IFN-1a at the MS clinic of the Veterans Administration West Los Angeles Medical Center from 1995 to 2015. Of these, 59 patients with breakthrough disease were switched to BIW IM beta IFN-1a. Every 4 months a relapse history, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and a graded neurological examination (NE) were obtained. An annual MS protocol brain MRI was obtained on most patients. BD was defined as continued clinical relapses, new T2 or enhancing lesions on MRI, or worsening of EDSS or NE.",

Sleep disturbances are strongly associated with early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sleep-related failure of \"glymphatic\" clearance may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD and chronic TBI.Enlarged PVS are visible in the midbrain, basal ganglia (BG), and centrum semiovale (CS) on MRI. Recent studies suggest the number of enlarged PVS may be predictors of neurological outcomes. Visible PVS on MRI could be a marker of abnormal glymphatic clearance in the brain.We hypothesized that patients with sleep disturbances would have increased burden of visible PVS on MRI.Methods: Patients with in-lab overnight polysomnography and available brain MRI's completed the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) as part of a larger IRB-approved study at a single site, the Portland VA (MIRB #3641, PI: Lim).

            "text": "Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is the most common complication of diabetes affecting up to 60% of diabetic patients. The pathogenesis of DN in Type 2 diabetes is directly related to dyslipidemia associated with the western diet composed of elevated levels of long chain saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and low levels of medium chain SFAs. Long chain SFAs are associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia while medium chain SFAs have been associated with decreased lipid accumulation and improved mitochondrial function. Since DN is primarily a disorder of the sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, we sought to evaluate the impact of medium and long chain SFA hydrocarbon chain length on mitochondrial trafficking mechanisms that are critical for distributing ATP throughout the DRG axon to provide energy for neuronal function. We hypothesize that long chain SFAs will impair mitochondrial trafficking whereas medium length SFAs will not impact mitochondrial transport along the DRG axon. In this study, we examined the impact of SFA hydrocarbon chain length on mitochondrial trafficking, directionality and velocity in primary mouse DRG neurons. DRG neurons were treated with increasing concentrations of long chain SFAs, stearate and palmitate, or medium chain SFA, laurate, ranging from 31.25 to 250 micromolar for twenty-four hours. DRG neurons treated with long-chain SFAs, palmitate and stearate, showed a significant decrease in the percentage of motile mitochondria whereas medium chain SFA, laurate, does not alter mitochondrial motility. We next assessed whether motile mitochondria in DRG neurons treated with palmitate or stearate exhibited altered directionality or velocity of mitochondrial trafficking. Palmitate and stearate treatments resulted in a trending decrease in the number of mitochondria trafficking in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Furthermore, 62.5 to 250 micromolar palmitate and stearate induced a significant decrease in mitochondrial velocity. Laurate treatment, on the other hand, retained directionality and velocity of mitochondrial trafficking. These results suggest that hydrocarbon chain length of saturated fatty acids plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial trafficking mechanisms in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Impaired mitochondrial trafficking in DRG neurons exposed to elevated levels of long-chain SFAs may play a critical role in the progression of DN.",

Los Angeles, CA Objective: We report a case of wound botulism presenting as acute bilateral vocal cord paralysis and review the literature for approaches to emergent diagnosis of botulism.Background: Botulism present as flaccid paralysis due to enzymatic inhibition of acetylcholine release in the synapses by the botulinum toxin (BoNT). Seven serotypes of neurotoxin, labeled A to G, are produced by Clostridium botulinum species. Given that the clinical manifestation of botulism might often mimic other neuromuscular disease, an emergent diagnosis remains a challenge.Methods: Case report. Case presentation: A 31 year-old previously healthy man with a history of polysubstance abuse and IV drug use (IDU) presented with two days of worsening muffled voice and shortness of breath. He was first evaluated in the Emergency Department by an otolaryngologist who identified bilateral vocal cord paralysis on laryngoscopy. Subsequent neurological examination identified dysarthria, bilateral dilated pupils, bilateral ptosis, proximal muscle weakness and diffuse areflexia. General physical exam identified a large abscess in the left gluteal region. Within the first nine hours, the patient was intubated for respiratory failure. Botulism infection was suspected based on the combination of acute onset flaccid paralysis, history of drug use, the abscess, and a bedside syringe later confirmed to contain black tar heroin. Within twenty-four hours, the patient was treated with heptavalent equine antitoxin obtained from the CDC. Serum Botulinum toxin A was confirmed five days later. Repetitive nerve stimulation demonstrated an incremental response of compound muscle action potential after exercise.Adherence to migraine treatment recommendations can prevent migraine attacks and reduce the impact of each attack. Headache diaries are commonly used in migraine treatment. This study aimed to develop a clinical decision support tool (CDST) embedded in an electronic headache diary. Initial development of the electronic headache diary included creating a HIPAA-compliant, research-grade headache diary iOS application and eliciting feedback from people with migraine. Overall, people with migraine (n 5 10) reported the user experience was intuitive, but reported comprehension difficulty with certain item responses and perceived overlap between items.Initial development of the CDST diary incorporated clinical treatment guidelines and clinical provider interviews. Neurologists (n 5 5) and psychologists (n 5 4) provided a wide range of candidate CDST messages, including simple reminders about daily lifestyle changes, and complex reminders to support inthe-moment acute management decision-making.Continuing iterative development of the CDST diary includes (a) creating an educational module to accompany the CDST-embedded diary and (b) piloting the CDST dairy and educational module in people with migraine, who provided feedback on user experience, message content, message delivery and frequency, and overall satisfaction.",

San Francisco, CA Cerebral palsy (CP), a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder, is known to be associated with brain inflammation, but the core molecular pathways controlling this inflammation and the relationship to the downstream neuropathology in CP are poorly understood. Here we show that mice with CNS-specific conditional deletion of the integrin aVb8 ((Itgb8DCNS mice), develop neurologic symptoms (motor dysfunction and spasticity), typical of CP. Similar to humans, Itgb8DCNS mice have diffuse astro-and microgliosis, hypomyelination, and reduced numbers of interneurons. The principal role for aVb8 is to activate TGFb. We therefore asked which cells in the brain require TGFb to suppress this CP-like phenotype. We found that microglia in Itgb8DCNS mice have reduced phospho-SMAD3 and altered gene expression consistent with reduced TGFb signaling in these cells. Furthermore, mice with microglia-specific conditional deletion of the TGFb receptor phenocopy Itgb8DCNS mice, suggesting that loss ofb TGFb signaling in microglia is sufficient to cause the CP phenoty. Together, these data identify a novel role for aVb8/TGFb signaling in microgliogenesis, CNS inflammation and CP, and have profound implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat this devastating disease.
