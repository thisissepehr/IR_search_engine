Critically ill patients experience both muscle wasting and a change in muscle appearance on ultrasound (increased echogenicity) [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Measurements of muscle ultrasound thickness and echogenicity have high inter-rater reliability in both healthy [25] [26] [27] and critically ill patients [28, 29] . Even in the presence of critical illness and edema, muscle thickness measurements at the biceps, mid-forearm, and mid-thigh correlate well with lean body mass [27, 30] . Muscle thickness decreases faster in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure [31] . Increased muscle echogenicity may be caused by intramuscular inflammation, necrosis, edema, fatty deposition, and/or fibrosis [29, 32, 33] .

The physician performing the electrophysiologic tests was unblinded, although muscle ultrasound was always performed before NCS/EMG at each weekly visit so that electrophysiologic testing results would not influence ultrasound interpretation. Since peroneal and sural NCS results were included as part of the reference standard criteria for probable CIPNM and both the index and reference tests were performed by the same specialist, the study was at risk of incorporation bias, which may lead to overestimation of diagnostic accuracy of our screening tests. We did not perform nerve or muscle biopsies, but it is impractical to perform these invasive procedures in most critically ill patients. It is possible that some of the changes in muscle echogenicity were due to edema, but fluid overload itself may still be harmful [44] . The prevalence of probable CIPNM in our study was 18%, which was slightly lower than the 20% prevalence we expected in our sample size calculations and led to wider confidence intervals for index test sensitivity. We could not perform MRC strength testing due to altered mental status in the majority of study visits, consistent with prior literature demonstrating that most prolonged mechanically ventilated patients are unable to perform manual muscle testing [18] .

Compared with full four-limb NCS/EMG, unilateral single nerve NCS is quicker, less painful for the patient, and could facilitate the diagnosis of CIPNM. The peroneal CMAP amplitude is 100-to 1000-times larger than the sural SNAP amplitude and is thus easier to find in ICUs that frequently have electrical interference. However, an abnormal peroneal or sural NCS requires follow-up with full NCS/EMG (and ideally muscle strength testing) to confirm a CIPNM diagnosis. Abnormal muscle echogenicity is a good screening test for probable CIPNM and provides additional prognostic information to NCS/EMG.
