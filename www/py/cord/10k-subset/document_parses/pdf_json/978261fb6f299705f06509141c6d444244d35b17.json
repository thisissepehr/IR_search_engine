Methods We performed a case-control study of heart rate variability (HRV) in newborns with complex CHD [transposition of the great arteries (TGA) or hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)] and low-risk control newborns without CHD. Cases with CHD were admitted following birth to a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit and had archived continuous ECG data. Control infants were prospectively enrolled at birth. ECG data in cases and controls were analyzed for HRV in the time and frequency domains at 24 h of age. We analyzed the following HRV metrics: alpha short (\u03b1 s ), alpha long (\u03b1 L ), root mean square short and long (RMS s and RMS L ), low-frequency (LF) power, normalized LF (nLF), high-frequency (HF) power, and normalized HF (nHF). We used ANOVA to compare HRV metrics between groups and to control for medication exposures. Results HRV data from 57 infants with CHD (TGA, n = 33 and HLHS, n = 24) and from 29 controls were analyzed. The HRV metrics \u03b1 S , RMS L , LF, and nLF were significantly lower in infants with CHD than in the controls.

After adjusting for medications, \u03b1 S and nLF remained lower and nHF higher in newborns with CHD (P < 0.0005).

Newborns with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) are at particular risk for hemodynamic instability in the period immediately after birth due to their anatomic cardiovascular anomaly. An additional risk for poor transition in newborns with complex CHD is impaired function of the ANS. Since fetal conditions associated with reduced oxygen and nutrient supply (e.g., complex CHD) may impair maturation of the ANS, the ANS may be unprepared for optimal transition in newborns with complex CHD [1] . Infants with complex CHD who have a poor cardiorespiratory transition can be seen clinically as being at a higher risk for hypotension after birth and requiring greater respiratory support. Furthermore, the autonomic balance in the newborn has not yet established that of the mature ANS, since vagal tone continues to increase through infancy [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 693, "end": 696, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1045, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and dextrotransposition of the great arteries (TGA) are two forms of complex CHD that may result in significant hemodynamic instability in the period after birth because of the abnormal circulatory anatomy; during this critical period of adaptation, ANS balance is likely of major importance. Both of these types of CHD are diagnosed in the fetal period or in the immediate postnatal period and require surgery within a few days to weeks after birth. In HLHS, the left side of the heart is small and may provide inadequate systemic and cerebral perfusion; central mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood results in hypoxemic cerebral perfusion. Similarly, in TGA, the aorta and pulmonary arteries are transposed, with the more deoxygenated stream ascending through the aorta into the cerebral circulation. These cardiac anomalies may therefore predispose to both cerebral hypoxemia and hypoperfusion during fetal brain development, leading to potential dysmaturation of the central ANS centers.

Long-term variability is influenced by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, whereas short-term variability is influenced more by the parasympathetic nervous system, based on rapid ANS needs [13] . Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a modified root mean square (RMS) analysis approach that is based on the principles of statistical physics and is designed to counter nonstationarity in RRi [10, 14] . Since accelerations and decelerations in infant heart rate can be caused by infant movement, the heart rate is nonstationary, and DFA provides a way to account for this type of data. This approach is now widely used [15] . Briefly, this method involves (1) calculating the profile function as the cumulative sum of the RRi values; (2) partitioning the profile function into nonoverlapping windows containing a particular number of beats, denoted s; (3) fitting the profile inside each window using a polynomial function; (4) calculating the local fluctuation function in each window as the root mean square of the deviation of the profile from the best fit; and (5) calculating the global fluctuation function as the median of the local fluctuation functions over all windows. Steps 2-5 are repeated for each 10-min epoch. In step (3), we used a fourth-order polynomial function (DFA4), and the value of s was increased in small steps from 6 beats to one-fourth the total number of beats in a 10-min epoch. We derived the following metrics using the fluctuation functions: S and L ; these are the slope of the fluctuation function between beats 15 and 30 and the slope of the fluctuation function between beat 35 and the beat corresponding to one-fourth of the total number of samples, respectively (Fig. 1) . Similarly, RMS S is the maximum of the fluctuation function between beats 15 and 50, whereas RMS L is the maximum of the fluctuation function between beats 100 and 150. The metrics quantify the autocorrelation in the RRi, whereas the RMS metrics quantify the variability in the RRi. The metrics are dimensionless quantities. The RMS metrics are in units of seconds indicates that a fourth-order polynomial was used in the detrending process (refer to text for details). The short-term exponent (\u03b1 S ) was calculated from the scale region shown in the black dashed rectangle.

Highfrequency (HF) variability reflects parasympathetic function and is influenced by the respiratory rate, while low-frequency (LF) variability is due to a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs and baroreflex-induced changes in HR [16] . We used Welch's periodogram approach to calculate the power spectrum of the RRi in every 10-min epoch. This method involves partitioning the RRi into 30-s windows (so that the frequency resolution of the resulting spectrum is 0.033 Hz) and calculating the periodogram as the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the RRi in that window. We obtained an estimate of the power spectrum as the average of the periodograms from all windows. Using the power spectrum, we calculated the following four metrics: the LF and HF powers as the logarithm of the median spectral power in 0.05-0.25 Hz and the logarithm of the median spectral power in 0.3-1 Hz, respectively; the normalized LF (nLF) and normalized HF (nHF) as the ratio of the sum of the spectral power in 0.05-0.25 Hz to the total power and the ratio of the sum of the spectral power in 0.3-1 Hz to the total power, respectively.

Importantly, the measured autonomic depression remained significant after controlling for medication exposures in the infants with CHD. The knowledge that infants with CHD demonstrate impairment in both sympathetic and parasympathetic balance and have a complex anatomic abnormality that may complicate physiological adaptation during the transitional period may in future be used to improve the care of newborns with complex CHD. For example, impairment in autonomic balance may precede clinically significant hypotension. Since the sympathetic nervous system is important for maintaining cerebral blood flow and cerebral autoregulation, lower autonomic balance could disrupt cerebral blood flow such that it drops below the threshold of autoregulation, affecting cerebral perfusion [24] . With the additional circulatory effects of the anatomic cardiac anomalies in these infants, such an impairment in autonomic balance might further increase the risk of impaired cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during the fetal-to-postnatal transition. Studies evaluating the normal early maturation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS have shown that the sympathetic division begins to develop earlier than the parasympathetic division, which in turn undergoes more accelerated maturation during the third trimester [25, 26] . Adverse intrauterine conditions are known to increase the risk for disturbed fetal development, especially brain development [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Fetuses with complex CHD, including TGA and HLHS, undergo intrauterine brain development under conditions of tenuous cerebral oxygen delivery.

Several studies have focused on the effect of CHD on HRV characteristics in the fetal period [7, 32] . In a study by Siddiqui et al. [7] , using fetal ECG recordings, the authors found a decrease in HRV in fetuses with cyanotic CHD compared to controls. This difference was only significant at gestational ages of between 34 and 38 weeks in fetuses with HLHS, while TGA fetuses showed HRV that was not significantly different from controls at any gestational age [7] . Specific analysis of the sympathetic versus parasympathetic balance was not described [7] . In a study comparing intrapartum fetal heart rate between fetuses with CHD and controls, severe variable decelerations and prolonged decelerations occurred more often in fetuses with CHD than in controls [33] . These features were attributed to a difference in autonomic balance, with a more pronounced parasympathetic response occurring in infants with a potentially lower hypoxemic reserve than in fetuses without CHD. In infants, a hypoxic state may affect ANS function through afferent effects on chemoreceptors that modulate autonomic balance [24] . Unlike Siddiqui's fetal HRV study [7] , we found a significant early postnatal depression of autonomic balanceespecially in sympathetic power-in infants with both CHD types, TGA and HLHS.

Since the exact nature of the relation between the variability in RRi and the mean heart rate is not clear, we have not explored this option in our study. Furthermore, the normalization should not affect the normalized spectral power.

Since our normative dataset for HRV consisted of recordings performed in the first 24-48 h after birth, it enabled us to compare infants with complex CHD to control infants at a similar postnatal age. We were, however, unable to compare the control infants to CHD infants at a later time period since the controls only underwent one ECG session. Infants with CHD were studied at an earlier hour of age than the control infants, due to earlier availability of the CHD infants' data upon admission to our tertiary care children's hospital compared to the control newborns, who were prospectively recruited following birth. While this difference is statistically significant, the biological difference is likely insignificant. Since the ANS maturation after birth is unlikely to be on the scale of hours, we doubt that this small time difference accounts for the differences in ANS maturation between our cases and controls [4, 34] . Furthermore, a larger number of infants with TGA were on mechanical ventilation due to a need for balloon atrial septostomy compared to the infants with HLHS. We controlled for medication exposure and evaluated for the impact of mechanical ventilation in our infants with CHD in order to check if this clinical difference impacted the HRV findings. Children's National is a referral center for neonatal cardiac surgery with no delivery services. Thus, all except one of the CHD cases were outborn, and many were started on PGE1 treatment prior to their arrival at our institution. Prostaglandins are known to exert effects on the ANS and thus might have played some role in the results of our study.

Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the high prevalence of long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity in survivors of certain CHD types is likely due to an accumulation of neurologic insults at multiple points in time, including the fetal, pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods.
