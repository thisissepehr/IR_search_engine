AOs of morpholino phosphoroamidate (PMO) and 2 0 -O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA (2 0 Ome RNA) chemistry have been shown to restore dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle but not in heart, following high-dose systemic delivery in murine models of muscular dystrophy (mdx). Exploiting the cell transduction properties of two basic arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides, we demonstrate widespread systemic correction of dystrophin expression in body-wide muscles and cardiac tissue in adult dystrophic mdx mice, with a single low-dose injection of peptide-conjugated PMO AO. This approach was sufficient to restore uniform, high-level dystrophin protein expression in peripheral muscle and cardiac tissue, with robust sarcolemmal relocalization of the dystrophin-associated protein complex and functional improvement in muscle. Peptide-conjugated AOs therefore have significant potential for systemic correction of the DMD phenotype. Figure 4.

Peptides were conjugated to PMO AOs targeting the murine dystrophin exon 23 5 0 splice donor site, using an established 25mer target sequence.

A 25 mg/kg single injection administration protocol was tested with the P007-PMO conjugate administered via the mouse tail vein. Three weeks following single injections, all skeletal muscle fibres immunostained positive for sarcolemmal dystrophin. The intensity of dystrophin expression was near normal in most skeletal muscle groups analysed, although slightly lower in biceps as shown (Fig. 1A) . Widespread, uniform expression of dystrophin protein over multiple tissue sections within each muscle group was detected in hind limb, fore limb, abdominal wall and diaphragm muscles. Surprisingly, no obvious area-toarea variation was found within individual muscle groups as previously reported with the systemic delivery of naked PMO AOs (4). RT-PCR results revealed almost total exon skipping of the mutated transcript with highly effective skipping of mdx dystrophin exon 23 (Fig. 1B) in all skeletal muscles analysed including the diaphragm. Less efficient molecular correction was observed in heart, where 50% of the mutated transcript was found to be exon skipped by RT-PCR. A shorter band was also detected in the RT-PCR assay in many analysed tissues, which was likely to correspond to a skipped transcript lacking exons 22 and 23. Subsequent sequencing of this PCR fragment confirmed that the minor transcript product contained exon 22 and 23 deletions (data not shown). To quantify the levels of dystrophin protein restored, western blot analysis was undertaken, using total protein extracted from all muscle groups including heart, and from normal C57 TA and heart muscle tissues as positive controls. This indicated that between 25 and 100% of normal dystrophin protein levels had been restored in body-wide skeletal muscles following the single systemic AO injection. Of particular significance were the levels approaching 100% restoration of dystrophin protein that were detected in distal muscle groups, i.e. TA and biceps, while even in the diaphragm almost 25% of normal dystrophin protein was restored (Fig. 1C) .",

Given this finding and that the half-life of dystrophin protein in vivo has been estimated at up to 26 weeks in mdx mice (19) , we decided to test whether modifications to the AO delivery protocol to include multiple lower-dose injections could improve molecular dystrophin correction without AO dose saturation in skeletal muscles. A protocol of weekly injections of P007-PMO at 6 mg/kg for 3 weeks resulted in a lower total AO dose administered and significantly improved molecular correction compared with age-matched controls in body-wide muscles as shown by immunostaining ( Fig. 2A) . High levels of dystrophin expression were detected in TA, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles, comparable with that found following the 25 mg/kg dose. The most striking differences were seen in the abdominal wall muscles, diaphragm and heart, where a lower level of dystrophin correction was found with the 6 mg/kg dose regime compared with the 25 mg/kg dose. RT-PCR results were consistent with the immunostaining data, again showing almost complete exon 23 skipping in TA, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles, but only 50% exon skipping efficiency in diaphragm and abdominal wall muscles, with even less dystrophin exon 23 skipping detectable in heart, although dystrophin-positive fibres were observed in the cardiac tissue by immunostaining (Fig. 2B) . The western blot data demonstrated a lower level of protein restoration in abdominal wall, diaphragm and heart tissues, compared with that seen following the 25 mg/kg treatment, consistent with the RT-PCR and immunostaining findings (Fig. 2C ). In this lower-dose study, we also compared the second peptide-PMO conjugate-B-PMO-using the same approach, with the results again confirming that the P007-PMO compound had superior activity to B-PMO as determined at both RNA (data not shown) and protein levels (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2C ).

            "text": "Dystrophin plays a critical role in muscle by linking cytoplasmic actin to a sarcolemmal dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and via this to the extracellular matrix (20, 21) . The DAPC also has important signalling functions via nNOS and other components (22, 23) . In the absence of functional dystrophin the DAPC fails to localize accurately to the sarcolemma and its function is compromised. We therefore investigated whether restored dystrophin protein expression via systemic P007-PMO delivery resulted in the successful relocalization of DAPC protein constituents to the sarcolemma. As expected, the expression of multiple DAPC component proteins including b-dystroglycan, a-sarcoglycan and b-sarcoglycan and nNOS, was detected in peripheral skeletal muscles with correct sarcolemmal localization and with staining intensities commensurate with that observed for dystrophin at the 25 mg/kg dose (Fig. 3A) . The restoration of DAPC components was also observed in the 6 mg/kg dose study although at a correspondingly lower level of expression (data not shown). As a result of successfully restored dystrophin and DAPC expression we then wished to determine whether any evidence of improved muscle function could be detected. Using a functional test of grip force strength (24 -26) , evaluating predominantly but not exclusively forelimb muscle strength, mdx mice treated with P007-PMO AO were shown to have significantly improved grip strength to within the normal range following a 25 mg/kg dose, compared with untreated mdx control mice (Fig. 3B) . Some improvement was also detected in mdx mice treated with the 6 mg/kg P007-PMO dose but it was not as great as that seen following the 25 mg/kg treatment (data not shown). The percentage of muscle fibres with centrally located nuclei is an index of ongoing degeneration/regeneration cycles (27, 28) . Counts of centrally located nuclei within treated mdx muscle groups (TA, gastrocnemius and quadriceps) revealed a significant reduction in centrally nucleated myofibres compared with untreated control mdx mice, suggesting a reduced regenerative stimulus and restoration of normal myofibre architecture commensurate with improved function (Fig. 3C) . There was also a significant fall in the number of centrally nucleated fibres in TA and gastrocnemius muscles at the 6 mg/kg dose (data not shown). Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated in mdx mice and are indicative of ongoing muscle pathology and membrane instability (29) . The significantly lower levels of serum CK found in P007-PMO treated mdx mice compared with untreated controls indicated the widespread protection effect of restored dystrophin expression on myofibre integrity (Fig. 3D) .",

Haematoxylin and eosin staining of liver and kidney tissue sections did not reveal overt signs of tissue damage in mdx mice treated with P007-PMO conjugate, with no deleterious changes detectable in tissue morphology or increase in the numbers of infiltrating cells compared with untreated mdx control mice. Of particular interest was the liver histology where not only was no evidence of toxicity found following treatment, but a reversal of the typical swollen hepatic cell pathology (30) found in untreated mdx mice was seen (Fig. 4A) . Serum was collected from treated mdx mice and control mice, and this showed a significant decrease in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) liver enzymes in the treated mice, with levels of these enzymes returned to within the normal range compared with untreated mdx mice and normal age-matched untreated control mice (Fig. 4B) . No change was found in the serum levels of urea and creatinine with P007-PMO treatment compared with untreated mdx controls and normal mice (data not shown) suggesting no adverse effects of the P007-PMO treatment on renal function at the doses studied. Overall these results indicated that over the course of the experiment, the P007-PMO conjugate did not induce any overt hepatic or renal toxicity at the systemic dose of 25 mg/kg in mdx mice.

Continued skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue using PMO AOs conjugated to arginine-rich peptides, administered at low systemic doses. A single 25 mg/kg intravenous dose of PMO-peptide conjugate was sufficient to rescue high levels of sarcolemmal dystrophin protein, DAPC component re-localization and histological and functional correction, with the P007-PMO conjugate demonstrating the greater efficacy. This highlights the potential of PMO-peptide conjugates as compounds with therapeutic value for body-wide and cardiac dystrophin correction and is corroborated in a recent report of a related conjugate (31) . Clinical studies to evaluate AO exon skipping in DMD patients are in progress in both The Netherlands (11) and the UK, using 2 0 O-methyl phosphorothioate and PMO AO compounds, respectively. AO-peptide conjugates therefore offer the possibility of efficient systemic and cardiac dystrophin correction at significantly lower doses than previously used for unconjugated AOs in mdx mice (4), reducing possible concerns regarding potential toxicity of high dose 2 0 O-methyl phosphorothioate and PMO AOs in human subjects and the cost of AOs. While further studies are warranted to fully investigate the toxicological profile of the transduction peptides used in this report, we found no evidence of systemic toxicity in treated mdx mice over the course of the experiments.",

            "text": "Previous work investigating PMO-based exon skipping in adult mdx mice failed to find evidence of cardiac dystrophin correction even at a very high multiple doses of 100 mg/kg (4, 18) . Our data demonstrating widespread dystrophin correction in heart, with protein levels restored up to 20% of normal at 3 weeks following single intravenous AO injections, shows that there is no intrinsic barrier to cardiac dystrophin correction in mdx mice using AO therapeutic agents (indeed high efficiency AO-mediated exon skipping can be achieved in primary mdx cardiomyocytes; Walker, Wood and Yin, unpublished data). Given that correction of the cardiac defect due to loss of dystrophin protein is an essential component of a successful DMD therapy (14, 15) and that therapies restoring dystrophin in skeletal muscles but not in cardiac muscle may exacerbate the underlying cardiac pathology (32), PMOpeptide conjugates have significant potential for systemic correction of the DMD phenotype. The mechanism by which the arginine-rich (RXR) 4 transduction peptide facilitates cardiac AO delivery and efficacy within that tissue remains unclear. Such cationic peptides are thought to bind to cell-associated glycosaminoglycans to be subsequently internalized by endocytosis (16) , thus the mechanism by which such biochemical events may lead to enhanced transvascular AO delivery to Figure 1A . Muscle tissues analysed were from tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius, quadriceps, biceps, abdominal wall, diaphragm and heart muscles (scale bar \u00bc 200 mm). High numbers of dystrophin-positive fibres are detected in crosssections within the skeletal muscles but not in heart. (B) RT-PCR to detect the dystrophin exon skipping products in various treated mdx muscle groups as shown; unskipped or deleted for exon 23 or exon 22 and 23 as indicated in the boxes. Results show almost no full-length dystrophin transcript is detectable in TA, quadriceps and gastrocnemius (indicated by boxed number [22] [23] [24] , with 50% exon 23 skipping in abdominal muscle and diaphragm and less in heart. (C) Western blot to detect dystrophin protein in the indicated muscle groups from treated mdx mice compared with C57BL6 and untreated mdx control mice. Data shows up to 30% dystrophin expression in quadriceps and gastrocnemius, but lower levels in diaphragm and less in heart. Equal loading of 50 mg protein is shown for each sample except for C57BL6 control lane where 5 mg of protein was loaded. a-actinin expression was detected as a loading control. cardiac and muscle tissue is not understood. Nevertheless, highly efficient cardiac and muscle gene delivery can be achieved using AAV vectors (33, 34) , including the delivery of splice correcting DNA constructs (35) , and therefore it seems plausible that arginine-rich transduction peptides permit efficient transvascular AO tissue entry to these tissues via similar mechanisms. While re-administration of peptide-PMO AOs will be required, our data suggests that similar levels of cardiac dystrophin correction may be achievable compared with that found using the AAV antisense strategy, without the potential disadvantages of toxic or immunological effects attributable to the vector. Mechanistic insight and further structure-activity studies are likely to identify improved peptides for transvascular cardiac AO transduction. Whether restoration of cardiac dystrophin protein to 20% of normal levels is likely to be adequate to regain or maintain normal cardiac function is unknown and further studies will be required, particularly in DMD animal models manifesting a significant cardiac phenotype, e.g. dystrophin and utrophin deficient DKO mice (36) or the golden retriever dog model. However in DMD patients, the degree to which cardiac function is regained or maintained will depend not only on the level of dystrophin protein restored but also on the particular BMD-like dystrophin isoform restored by exon skipping in each case, given that the BMD cardiac phenotype is highly heterogeneous (14, 37) .",

Many muscle groups demonstrated dystrophin protein restored to levels in excess of 50% of normal, significantly higher than that reported previously using naked PMO compounds (4) or estimated in the first Figure 3 . Functional evaluation of mdx skeletal muscles following treatment with the P007-PMO conjugate. (A) Restoration of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) in mdx mice treated with P007-PMO at 25 mg/kg was studied to assess dystrophin function and recovery of normal myoarchitecture. DAPC protein components b-dystroglycan, a and b-sarcoglycan and nNOS were detected by immunostaining in tissue cross-sections of TA muscles from treated mdx mice compared with C57BL6 normal mice and untreated mdx control mice. All detected DAPC components are found to be successfully re-localized to the mdx muscle sarcolemma after treatment. (B) Muscle function was assessed using a functional grip strength test to determine the physical improvement of P007-PMO treated mdx mice compared with C57BL6 and untreated mdx mice. Data shows significant functional improvement in treated mdx mice with functional recovery observed into the normal range seen in untreated age-matched control mice (P , 0.005). (C) Evaluation of the numbers of centrally nucleated myofibres in TA, gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles following a P007-PMO treatment compared with the corresponding untreated mdx muscles. Data shows a significant decrease in the number of centrally nucleated myofibres in treated mdx muscles compared with controls (P , 0.005). (D) Measurement of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels as an index of ongoing muscle membrane instability in treated mdx mice compared with normal and mdx control mice. Data show a significant fall in the serum CK levels in mdx mice treated with P007-PMO compared with untreated age-matched mdx controls (n \u00bc 6 for treated group and n \u00bc 4 for control, P , 0.05).",

As a consequence we found that DAPC protein components were efficiently re-localized, muscle histology appeared normal and muscle grip strength was restored to within the normal range. RT-PCR analysis using a nested reaction at 25 cycles revealed that for all tissues except the heart, virtually all mutant transcripts had been successfully skipped suggesting the possibility of AO-target saturation. We therefore tested whether or not a lower dose of PMO-peptide conjugate could effectively restore dystrophin expression. While near normal levels of dystrophin protein were restored in peripheral muscles with this lower dose, central muscles including diaphragm and heart were less well corrected at dystrophin and DAPC protein levels. The question therefore arises as to the optimal dosing regime of PMO-peptide AOs. Given our data at the high 25 mg/kg dose, that the estimated half-life of dystrophin protein approaches 26 weeks in mdx mice (18, 19) and that peptide conjugates are known to increase PMO tissue uptake and retention (38, 39) , a single higher PMO-peptide threshold dose followed by lower maintenance doses at 4 -8 week intervals may be optimal. Further studies will be required to determine this and to evaluate the longer-term functional and physiological effects of this treatment.",
