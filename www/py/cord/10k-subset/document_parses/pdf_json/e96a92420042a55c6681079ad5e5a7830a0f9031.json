In two representative studies, the median time to relapse or progression was 4 months for NHL patients and 5 months for HD patients. Only about 10% of relapses in both groups occurred 2 years or more after transplant. 12, 13 In addition, about two-thirds of the relapses involved sites of prior disease. The precise mechanisms responsible for resistance to high-dose chemotherapy are unknown, but presumably they include those which are thought to operate in lymphomas that recur after conventional-dose regimens. These mechanisms include up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, 20, 21 up-regulation of bcl-2 expression, [22] [23] [24] and mutation of the P53 genes. 22, 24 The latter two mechanisms may block the induction of apoptosis by a variety of important anti-neoplastic drugs. Indeed, the induction of apoptosis by the alkylating agents typically used in high-dose regimens (eg melphalan) is highly dependent upon the presence of wild-type P53 genes. 25 These facts imply that in order to decrease relapse rates after HDT, additional treatment must be rendered early after recovery from HDT and should include the sites of prior disease. Administration of non-cross-resistant chemotherapy may be important in this effort.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 576, "end": 579, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 930, "end": 933, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 972, "end": 976, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 977, "end": 981, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 982, "end": 986, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "With this background, two clinical protocols were developed which contained several treatment modifications designed to address some of the problems which were identified above. First, the high-dose chemotherapy regimen was modified from the standard BEAM regimen (BCNU/etoposide/cytarabine/melphalan) by the substitution of gemcitabine for cytarabine and etoposide. Compared to cytarabine, gemcitabine has equivalent antileukemic activity in murine and human pre-clinical leukemia models and a longer intracellular retention time while displaying a lack of cross-resistance to doxorubicin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, cisplatin, and methotrexate. [26] [27] [28] Gemcitabine also has single agent activity in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed HD and NHL. 29 Additionally, etoposide was given at a higher dose level in combination with cyclophosphamide for pre-transplant cytoreduction and stem cell mobilization. Second, during the early post-transplant period (approximately weeks [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] when hematopoietic recovery might be incomplete, patients were scheduled to be treated with agents considered to have limited effects on marrow function: patients with B cell NHL were assigned to receive the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituxan in combination with GM-CSF while patients with HD and T cell NHL were assigned to receive low-moderate dose involved-field radiation to sites of pretransplant involvement. The rationale for adding GM-CSF to rituxan was to potentially augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through enhanced effector cell recruitment and activation. [30] [31] [32] [33] The third innovation was to utilize a series of consolidation chemotherapy treatments at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post transplant when hematopoietic recovery might be more complete. The regimen for months 3 and 9 was dexamethasone-cyclophosphamideetoposide-cisplatin-gemcitabine (DCEP-G) and the regimen for months 6 and 12 was dexamethasone-paclitaxelcisplatin (DPP). The DCEP-G regimen was modified from DCEP which was originally developed for the treatment of patients with relapses of myeloma after autotransplantation. 34 This regimen produced major responses (\u03fe75% reductions in paraprotein levels) in 41% of patients with relapsed myeloma. In addition, equivalent responses were observed for patients with both plasmacytic and plasmablastic histologies, suggesting that this regimen might also be active for patients with other aggressive lymphoid neoplasms. To permit inclusion of gemcitabine, a novel agent with single agent activity against advanced NHL and especially HD, 35 the doses of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin were attenuated from the original DCEP. Paclitaxel was utilized because responses to tubulin-active agents do not appear to depend on the presence of wildtype p53, 25 and paclitaxel is a potent inducer of bcl-2 phosphorylation which leads to inactivation of this anti-apoptotic oncogene. 36 Furthermore, the administration of paclitaxel alone to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL resulted in overall response rates of 17% (140 mg/m 2 ) or 25% (200 mg/m 2 ) and an overall response rate of 44% when combined with moderately high-dose cyclophosphamide. [37] [38] [39] Therefore, it was anticipated that the DPP regimen might be active against residual alkylator-resistant lymphoma cells which remained after high-dose therapy.

Early after transplantation, relatively non-myelotoxic treatments were administered: rituxan combined with GM-CSF for patients with B cell NHL and involved-field radiation for patients with HD or T cell NHL. Later after transplantation, patients were eligible to receive DCEP-G alternating with DPP at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Several conclusions can be drawn for this experience. First, post-transplant consolidation treatments are feasible and generally well-tolerated. Twenty-five of the 26 patients with B cell NHL who survived long enough to receive rituxan \u03e9 GM-CSF, completed all four infusions and none had serious infusion-related toxicities. In addition, myelosuppression was mild and infrequent. However, two of the patients who received the rituxan infusions, later developed complications: bronchiolitis obliterans (1 patient) and a demyelinating encephalopathy (1 patient) which was consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy although JC virus DNA was not detected by in situ hybridization. The occurrence of these unusual complications of HDT, which may be linked to infections, highlights the need for close monitoring of patients who receive post-transplant therapies with immunosuppressive potential. Indeed, another study of adjuvant rituxan after autotransplantation revealed delayed immune recovery but no apparent increase in post-transplantation infections. 42 None of the eight patients who received post-transplant involvedfield radiation had late-stage infections but one patient developed restrictive lung disease, highlighting the need for close monitoring of pulmonary function in those patients who receive post-transplant radiation to the chest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The 72 courses of post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy were also generally well-tolerated by the 26 patients who were treated, although a single patient died from ARDS and renal failure during aplasia following the first course of consolidation chemotherapy.

While it could be argued that the observed changes might represent delayed responses to high-dose chemotherapy, the complete marrow response which occurred in one patient directly following rituxan/GM-CSF and the resolution of gallium avidity in association with decreased adenopathy in another patient, indicate that at least some of the incremental responses observed were due to the post-transplant antibody administration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Third, the contribution of post-transplant therapy and particularly post-transplant consolidation chemotherapy to event-free and overall survival remains to be determined. The event-free and overall survival figures for the cohort of patients with B cell NHL were no better than published results due to the relatively high rates of relapse and treatment-related mortality in this series. These causes of treatment failure may be due in part to patient selection given the relatively high proportion of patients (42%) who were transplanted with primary refractory disease. Nonetheless, the apparent failure of post-transplant consolidation therapy to delay or prevent relapse in this cohort of challenging patients with advanced B cell NHL may indicate that the post-transplant chemotherapy regimens were largely ineffective or that re-growth of lymphoma was too rapid for the treatments to be completed.

However, the possibility remains that the observed difference could be due to other factors such as the use of gemcitabine in the GBM conditioning.
