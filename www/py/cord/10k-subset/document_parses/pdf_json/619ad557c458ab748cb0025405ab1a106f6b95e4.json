Eight diabetics had experienced recent \"viral-like\" illnesses, predominantly repiratory, but these illnesses bore no uniform temporal relation to their onsets of diabetes. Diabetics demonstrated no serologic evidence of a recent viral illness common to all. Elevated titers to only one virus, coxsackie B-3, were more prevalent in diabetics than in controls (33% vs. 6%), but geometric mean titers of diabetics to a panel of 26 common viral antigens were similar to those of controls.
