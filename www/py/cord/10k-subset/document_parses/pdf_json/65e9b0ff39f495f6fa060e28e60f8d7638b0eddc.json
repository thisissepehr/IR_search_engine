We argue that these have arisen from at least five separate evolutionary origins, each of which is represented by a set of one or more modern-day families, termed a clan. Clan CA is the largest, containing the papain family, C1, and others with the Cys/His catalytic dyad. Clan CB (His/Cys dyad) contains enzymes from RNA viruses that are distantly related to chymotrypsin. The peptidases of clan CC are also from RNA viruses, but have papain-like Cys/His catalytic sites. Clans CD and CE contain only one family each, those of interleukin-ll3-converting enz3wne and adenovirus L3 proteinase, respectively. A few families cannot yet be assigned to clans. In view of the number of separate origins of enzymes of this type, one should be cautious in generalising about the catalytic mechanisms and other properties of cysteine peptidases as a whole. In contrast, it may be safer to generalise for enzymes within a single family or clan.",

The purpose of the present article is to describe these families, and to consider how they may be arranged in larger groups that reflect several separate evolutionary origins of cysteine peptidases.

The best method of detecting very distant relationships between proteins, or excluding them, is the comparison of tertiary structures, when these are available. To date, three-dimensional structures have been determined for members of four families of cysteine peptidases. The available structures are those of papain and several other members of family C1 [5] , hepatitis A virus endopeptidase (family C3) [6] , interleukin-ll3-converting enzyme (family C14) [7, 8] and the human adenovirus-2 proteinase (C5) [9] (Fig. 1 ). The structures seen in these four families are so different that it is virtually inconceivable that they had a common ancestor. We therefore take these families to represent four separate evolutionary origins of cysteine peptidases, or four separate clans. As we shall see, however, one of the clans of cysteine peptidases shares ancestors with a group of serine peptidases.",

The order of occurrence of the residues of the catalytic dyad in the linear sequence can be crucial, since one can be certain that a peptidase in which the active site residues occur in the order Cys, His cannot adopt the same fold as a peptidase in which the order is His, Cys. Both Cys/His and His/Cys arrangements of catalytic dyad residues occur amongst cysteine peptidases, and these help us to assign the families to clans. The amino acids surrounding the catalytic residues tend to be much more highly conserved than those elsewhere in the sequences and, accordingb; the sequences of these can give further clues to the grouping of families in clans.",

These have the Cys/His type of catalytic dyad, and show other similarities in the structure of the catalytic site. In the papain family, Gln 19, located in the active site wall, is important in defining the 'oxyanion hole', and Asn 175 has a role in orientating the imidazolium ring of the catalytic His ls9 [10] . Because of their important functions, these amino acids are absolutely conserved in the family, and also, the residue following the catalytic Cys 25 is invariably one with a bulky, hydrophobic side chain. Of the other families of peptidases known to have the Cys/His catalytic dyad, only those of calpain (family C2) and streptopain (C10) have the glutamine, asparagine (aspartic acid in streptopain) and bulky hydrophobic residues in the expected positions. The sequences forming the environments of the catalytic residues in these families also show other similarities to papain, and we therefore group families C1, C2 and C t 0 in clan CA. With few exceptions, the endopeptidases of clan CA show a strong preference for hydrolysis of bonds in which the P2 residue is a hydrophobic one. These enzymes are also more rapidly inactivated by iodoacetate than by iodoacetamide [11] . This is contrary to the intrinsic reactivities of these compounds with free thiol groups, and is dictated by a charge distribution in the enzyme active site that seems to be peculiar to clan CA. This pattern of reactivity is not seen with clostripain in family C11 [12] or legumain in C13 [13, 14] .",

The evolutionary relationships amongst the RNA viruses are obscure, but there are good reasons for thinking that they have common ancestry. One line of evidence for this is the fact that the viral polyproteins contain some homologous proteins, which tend to be arranged in the same order. These include a helicase and an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, and, in the polyprotein of the polio virus, picornain 3C lies between the helicase and the polymerase. The helicase-peptidase-polymerase sequence of genes is also seen with the endopeptidases of tobacco etch virus (C4), feline calicivirus (C24), Southampton virus (C37) and parsnip yellow fleck virus (C38). The endopeptidases of all five families contain the His/Cys dyad, but they are too dissimilar to be placed in one family. The simplest explanation for this situation is that the viral polyproteins are homologous, but that the peptidase domain has a high rate of mutation relative to the helicase and polymerase. On these grounds, families C3, CA, C24, C37 and C38 are assigned to clan CB. Peptidases from family C30 also have a His/Cys dyad and are tentatively included in clan CB.",

The picornains are not confined to action on the viral polyproteins, but also hydrolyse some host proteins. Thus, picornain 2A also cleaves the p220 subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G into two fragments, one directing helicase activity [36] . Picornain 3C seems to be responsible for the degradation of microtubule-associated protein 4 that is correlated with the collapse of the microtubules in the infected cell [37] . Through their actions on the polyprotein, and probably in other ways, the endopeptidases of clan CB perform vital functions in the replication of the viruses, many of which cause important diseases in animals and plants.

Also, polyubiquitin chains are disassembled, and the activated form of ubiquitin, ubiquitin thiol ester, may be hydrolysed [46] .",

The threedimensional structures of enzymes from three other families have been determined, and each has proved to have a unique protein fold, clearly unrelated and novel. It is therefore clear that there are a number of distinct evolutionary lines of cysteine peptidases, There is unequivocal evidence of the biomedical importance of the cysteine peptidases. This is seen in the pathophysiology of man and other animals, in the parasites and bacterial pathogens of man, in the physiology and pathology of plants, and in the replication of countless viruses. This demands that the peptidases from each of the clans be characterised with the thoroughness that has so far been accorded only to clan CA, and the work is now well underway.",
