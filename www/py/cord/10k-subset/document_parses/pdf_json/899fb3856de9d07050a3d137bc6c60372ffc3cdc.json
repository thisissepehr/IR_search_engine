As depicted in Fig. 4a , following designated duration of cell co-culture with infected neutrophils, influenza virus Nucleoprotein expression was detected with immunocytochemistry in FHC cells. The expression level of virul Nucleoprotein in the FHC cells at 4 h post infection was very low. With the increase of viral replication cycles, infected neutrophils gradually released more mature viral particles. The numbers of infected FHC cells were significantly increased at 8, 16 and 24 h post infection. The amounts of virus nucleoprotein positive signals were remarkably enhanced at 24 h (Fig. 4a) . Compared with the control group (Fig. 4b) , in which FHC cells were directly incubated with parent virus propagated in embryonated eggs, we found that the rate of infected FHC cells co-cultured with virus-infected neutrophils was much higher (Fig. 4c ). At 24 h post infection, flow cytometry demonstrated that the control group (FHC cells directly incubated with parent virus) had an average positive signal expression rate of 12.4%, and the experimental group (FHC cells co-cultured with virus-infected neutrophils) had an average rate of 50.8% (Fig. 4d) , represent an increase of reflecting an infection rate increase of over fourfold.",

We performed lectin staining with MAA and SNA on neutrophils and no detectible level of sialic acid, nor \u03b1 -2,3-linked or \u03b1 -2,6-linked was found, while positive controls ensured the reliability of our technical protocal. Two probabilities exist: Low level sialic acid residues might exist on neutrophil surface that might be below the detecting sensibility of lectin staining, or 2009 A (H1N1) virus strain can enter neutrophils without the classic salic acid receptors. As shown in Fig. S1 , there was no difference in the percentage of infected cells between groups of neutrophils with and without NA pretreatment. This result indicates that even low level of sialic acid residues exist on neutrophil surface, sialic acid-dependent entry may not the main route for influenza virus to infect neutrophils. There is likely that other sialic acid receptors independent route(s) of entry might exit for influenza virus to infect neutrophils. Cumulating evidence indicates that salic acid was not the sole gateway for influenza virus infection. It was reported that NWS-Mvi and parent influenza viruses could infect desialylated cells 21 . A/Memphis/1/71 (H3N2) influenza virus was found to bind to galactosyl ceramide (GalCer: Gal\u03b2 1 \u2192 1\u2032Cer), as well as sulphatide, in virus overlay assays 22 . Macropinocytosis is yet another pathway for viruses to enter neutrophils without binding to specific receptors 23 . Phagocytosis is a major strategy for neutrophils to defend against invading pathogens, and this is also a possible pathway for viruses to enter neutrophils 24 . Inconsistence between the distributions of classic avian influenza virus receptor and infected cells in H5N1 virus infected patients was also reported 25, 26 . The way and means of viral entry into neutrophils remain a subject of farther investigation.",

Previous reports demonstrated that infection by 2009 H1N1 virus was not confined to the upper respiratory tract but also involved the lungs and other organs, most importantly immune cells 36, 42 . Many fatal patients had lymphopenia and elevated creatinine kinase (CK) [43] [44] [45] . Lymphocytic disruption caused an acute immunodeficiency that resulted in acute progressive respiratory syndrome including lower respiratory tract disease, respiratory failure, and ARDS with refractory hypoxaemia 43, 44 . Based on our current findings that neutrophils can be infected by 2009 A (H1N1) and permit active viral replication, we hypothesize that infected immune cells including neutrophils may act as vehicles, transporting the virus to other organs and causing extra-pulmonary dissemination and multiple organ infection.

At 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h post infection, neutrophils attached on glass slides coated with fibronectin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in advance were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and blocked with 0.2%Triton X-100, 5%BSA. The slides were incubated overnight with mouse anti-CD15 monoclonal antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) or mouse anti-Influenza A virus matrix 1 (M1) antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) as the primary antibody. After washing in PBS, slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Life/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
