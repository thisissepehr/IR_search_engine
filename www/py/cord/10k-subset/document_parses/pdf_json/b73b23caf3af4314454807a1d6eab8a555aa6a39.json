These latter two groups had rates at or near 1.5/100. Thus, parenteral administration of the A2/HK vaccine also provided-protection to elderly adults while spray vaccination was ineffective.

Some support for this idea comes from the finding of three influenza infections in persons shedding a second respiratory virus. A third hypothesis is that vaccination interfered with the laboratory diagnosis of influenza. Evidence against this was the finding that influenza virus shedding rates were not reduced in vaccinees with serologic evidence of natural infections.
