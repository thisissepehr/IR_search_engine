The procedure and clinical results were evaluated from various points ( Table 2) Surgical Technique This operation is performed in two stages. After induction of general anesthesia, the patient is placed on the surgical bed in the right semi-lateral recumbent position. To facilitate manual access, a 6-cm horizontal skin incision is made in the right upper quadrant. The location of this skin incision depends on the patient's body habitus and/or the size of the spleen. When the patient has splenomegaly, a laparoscope is introduced through the subumbilical port. After the laparotomy incision is made, a hand port (LAP DISC, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) is introduced through that incision.

The surgeon's left hand is used to increase tension between the spleen and the greater curvature of the stomach, which makes the approach much easier and safer than the standard laparoscopic approach. 20 The division of the gastrosplenic ligament and devascularization of the short gastric vessels are accomplished with the same device. After the aforementioned steps are completed, the surgeon's finger can pass through the dorsal side of the splenic hilum. Using that hand to assist, the operator can directly palpate the pulsation of arteries during the operation. In doing so, if there is a rupture of the collateral vessels during the procedure, the operator can place direct pressure to achieve immediate hemostatic control. Immediate and direct hemostatic control with the surgeon's hand is an important advantage of the hand-assisted technique. A 40-mm linear stapler (white color) (Endo-GIA, United States Surgical, Norwalk, CT, USA) is inserted into the splenic hilum. Both the splenic artery and vein are divided together by this procedure. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the splenic artery and vein are sometimes dilated and run irregularly. As it is always difficult to isolate these vessels, we divide them together using a linear stapler. The spleen is then mobilized from the retroperitoneum. The freely mobile spleen is removed from the abdominal cavity by bag via a minilaparotomy incision.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 396, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MATERIALS AND METHODS"}, {"text": "For the second stage of the procedure, the patient is turned to the supine position.

The devascularization is performed between the gastric serosa and dilated veins. With the use of a Liga-Sure Atlas device, this procedure can be performed without significant bleeding. Then the gastrohepatic ligament is opened and devascularization of the lesser curvature is performed by the same method. At this point in a patient with gastric varices, a large draining vein will be seen in the area of upper gastric fundus. This vessel is ligated with laparoscopic clips.

Recently, endoscopic treatments, such as injection sclerotherapy (EIS) and endoscopic variceal ligation therapy (EVL), have showed great promise for esophageal varices; however, there is still controversy regarding the treatment of gastric varices. 5 Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) may be one of the choices for portal decompressive surgery; however, the long-term results of TIPS present some problems. Hepatic dysfunction may progress after TIPS with radical portal diversion. The failure rate of TIPS, including blockage of the stent, is reported to be as high as 30%-80% at 1 year post-TIPS, 6, 7 and it often leads to clinically significant variceal hemorrhage. 25 Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) has recently been accepted in Japan for its relative effectiveness and safety in the treatment of gastric varices. 10 This procedure includes the occlusion of the portosystemic blood shunt.

This procedure was first practiced and introduced by Warren and colleagues in 1967. 27 It involves selective drainage of the esophagogastric venous complex into the systemic circulation. In experienced hands, DRSR is quite effective in decompressing the portal pressure and arresting active variceal bleeding. However, the procedure is technically complicated, and unfortunately few centers have adequate expertise. A meta-analysis has shown that the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and mortality was increased significantly either in nonselective or selective shunt operations. 13 Recently, a smalldiameter interposition portocaval shunt using a polytetrafluoroethylene graft (H-graft portocaval shunt, HGPCS) has been described. Rosemurgy et al. 8 have reported that the H-graft maintains its patency much better than TIPS, and they concluded that surgical shunting using HGPCS should have a greater role for decompressing portal hypertension.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 149, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 353, "end": 355, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 852, "end": 854, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1022, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}, {"text": "In 1964, Hassab reported a successful technique of esophagogastric decongestion and splenectomy, which was performed mostly for schistosomiasis. 28 In 1977, Sugiura and Futagawa introduced extensive esophagogastric devascularization with esophageal transaction. 29 According to Japanese case reports, the result of this procedure have been excellent, with a re-bleeding rate of less than 10%. 26, 30 However, this technique has not been widely accepted in the Western countries because of its high postoperative morbidity and mortality. [16] [17] [18] Gastric devascularization and splenectomy without transection of the esophagus (Hassab's procedure) is a less invasive method. One disadvantage of the Hassab operation is that esophageal varices may occur because the Hassab procedure cannot block venous blood flow in the esophageal wall. However, in a recent study, this disadvantage was minimized by combining the Hassab operation with endoscopic sclerotherapy which has had satisfactory results. 31,32 A significant merit Table 3 . of the Hassab operation compared with other interventions is that when combined with splenectomy, the development of thrombocytopenia can be avoided. It is known that after splenectomy, there is an elevation of platelet count. 14 This expected rise in platelet count may be of great benefit to the surgeon, especially in the event that the patient needs further surgical intervention, for example in the case of hepatoma with liver cirrhosis. Hassab's operation can preserve portal blood flow, which produces lower incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. This surgical intervention should be considered to be one of the safest techniques currently in use for these cases. Laparoscopic surgery is a less invasive method than open surgery, but the laparoscopic surgery for portal hypertension is still considered a high-risk operation, with collateral venous change and severe splenomegaly and a bleeding tendency. 33 However, with the advancement of laparoscopic surgical devices, such as the ultrasonically activated coagulating shears (Harmonic Scalpel, Ethicon EndoSurgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA), the vessel-sealing system (Liga-Sure-Atlas), and the autosuture device (Endo-GIA), the outcome has improved. In our institution, with the surgeon's use of one hand in the hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab operation, this procedure has for us become a much easier and a safer method. 34, 35 It should be noted that in our series we had one death in the early postoperative course, on day 40. The patient suffered from pyloric stricture and delayed gastric emptying. This complication may have been due to inadvertent vagus nerve injury.
