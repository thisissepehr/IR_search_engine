First, confirmatory factor analysis was used to determine if the two a`priori subjective indicators of public health preparedness, one which addressed human/material resources and the second which addressed informational needs, conformed to expectations using eight survey questions Organizational jurisdiction, organizational attributes and training measures 161 related to organizational perceptions of the environment. A dimensional factor analysis approach was employed. The extraction method was principal components. In the dimensional analysis, the principal factors were extracted from the correlation matrix using communality estimates. Factors were defined with four considerations: (1) factor loadings greater than 0.40, (2) avoidance of redundant terms, (3) scree plot assessment (eigenvalues greater than 1 (Kaiser-Guttman rule) and falling within the sharp descent part of the plot before the eigenvalues start to level off), and (4) structure simplicity. This approach was consistent with that of Dorn et al. (2007) . Factors were rotated using a varimax rotation procedure. Second, multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to test the association of the three preparedness outcomes with organizational characteristics. Three sets of models were examined: (1) human and material resources, (2) informational needs, and (3) having exercised a preparedness plan in 2006. In the first set of models, perceived human and material resources preparedness was regressed on organizational jurisdiction, age, the principal area of focus, size, and organizational training measures. The annual budget variable was not included in the regression models as organizational size was used as a proxy indicator of an organization's annual budget. Organizational variables were then removed from the previous model if they failed to reach a significance level of p \\ 0.10 for the specific outcome. The regression model was then re-run with only significant organizational variables remaining (jurisdiction, number of employees and volunteers, and training measures). Overall model significance was assessed. This same modeling strategy was repeated in examining the two other preparedness outcomes, except that for the logistic regression model, fit was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test.

Moreover, these findings help fill a gap in the current literature with respect to which aspects of preparedness relate most strongly to organizational features.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Each finding supports to some degree recent recommendations on building public health preparedness capacity. The association between organizational training opportunities and perceived human and material resources preparedness is consistent with the Naylor Report's statement in Canada that accessible and effective training programmes in a number of formats for staff and personnel are essential for maintaining a public health system capable of responding to contemporary public health threats (National Advisory Committee 2003). The National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health indicates that many individuals within the public health preparedness workforce do not have the necessary knowledge and skills for full participation in planning, response, and evaluation activities as reported by public health leaders (2008). Consequently, they recommend competency-based emergency preparedness training that is effective, efficient, and economical for all individuals involved in the sector. Multiple works have also reported that inadequate training is a barrier to improving levels of preparedness (Nelson et al. 2007; Wasserman et al. 2006) . As suggested in this study, the presence of training opportunities do appear to be significant ingredients in how organizations perceive their degree of preparedness in terms of human and material resources. The association between organizational size and perceived informational needs preparedness suggests that organizations with greater personnel committed to public health preparedness or emergency management functions are more likely to report having adequate information related to public health preparedness training activities and funding in comparison with smaller organizations. The finding is logical, but also highlights the importance of having adequate personnel available to prepare for and manage the informational demands that arise at a time of an emergency. Several studies have indicated that not having enough personnel dedicated to planning and responding to emergencies is a significant barrier to preparedness both within organizations and across jurisdictions (Nelson et al. 2007; Wasserman et al. 2006; PHEP 2008) . For the Alberta sample, the fact that perceived informational needs and not perceived human and material resources preparedness were associated with organizational size suggests that organizations may make a careful distinction between the number of personnel available to them and their personnel's level of training. Greater organizational size may contribute to an organization's capacity to access and manage information about provincial and regional activities, but does not appear in this sample to be an indicator of the availability of trained personnel.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1154, "end": 1174, "text": "(Nelson et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1197, "text": "Wasserman et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2206, "text": "(Nelson et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2229, "text": "Wasserman et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2240, "text": "PHEP 2008)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, the association between organizational jurisdiction and whether an organization had exercised its plan suggests the possible presence of cross-jurisdictional disparities in preparedness.

While a paucity of information related to jurisdictional influence on preparedness levels exists, the current results mirror findings from recent work in Florida that has examined emergency management networks. According to this work, smaller municipalities have primarily relied upon counties or regional network supports for disaster-related functions since higher jurisdictional levels are better prepared for managing emergencies (Caruson et al. 2008 ). Other US research has indicated that aside from major metropolitan areas, few counties, cities, or towns have the capacity to respond to public health emergencies independently (Koh et al. 2008) . A US nationally representative survey conducted from 2000 to 2001 found that only 25% of local public health jurisdictions indicated they could deliver at least 60% of essential public health services in the case of a terrorist event (Baker and Koplan 2002) . At lower jurisdictional levels, limited resources and trained personnel may limit levels of preparedness. For example, local agencies may not have access to laboratory services which are used to identify organisms and environmental agents which affect community health, thus impairing their readiness to respond to an infectious disease outbreak or biological warfare event. Under these circumstances, it is imperative that local organizations develop formal relationships with laboratories outside the jurisdiction to assure services are available if needed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2002).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 807, "end": 827, "text": "(Caruson et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1025, "text": "(Koh et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1285, "text": "(Baker and Koplan 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "One limitation of this study concerns the representativeness of the sample.

On many occasions, sub-agencies chose to respond as part of the umbrella organization even though each has a separate role to play should a real public health emergency arise. For example, within Alberta Health and Wellness, the ''Emergency Health Services'' department and the ''Public Health Division'' were asked to complete the online survey, but they collaborated and completed one questionnaire.

Ideally, performance measures should consist of three different dimensions: structure (capacity), process, and outcomes (Donabedian 1978) . The organizational questionnaire focused primarily on structural measures of preparedness as these are the most amenable to policy changes. In terms of process, the questionnaire assessed if organizations had a written plan or had exercised their written emergency response or public health emergency plan. Since process measures are more proximally related to outcomes than structural ones, future work might be strengthened by placing greater emphasis on process measures related to preparedness (Asch et al. 2005) . For example, questions asking how well the workforce is performing their preparedness duties (process) rather than asking if the workforce is provided with training opportunities (structure) would be beneficial.

Yet, little is known comparatively about how prepared organizations either view themselves or are in terms of objective markers. The lack of a preparedness metric in this regard places important limitations on capacity-building policies. In examining the association between organizational characteristics and multiple dimensions of preparedness, the current work takes an important step in building a preparedness metric and linking it to organizational features. Since the measures examined in the current work are each associated with a different organizational characteristic, it may be important to include all three as part of a standardized preparedness metric. The development and use of such indicators to assess overall system preparedness as well as levels of preparedness would help address a gap in the current public health emergency surveillance and response system.
