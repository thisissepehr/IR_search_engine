Conclusion: These results indicate that rLZE3 is an excellent vaccine candidate and has great potential that should be evaluated in further preclinical studies.",

It can be spread by bites from virusinfected mosquitoes, similar to dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus in the same family. In recent years, the outbreak of ZV in tropical and subtropical regions has become a major public health issue [1, 2] . Infection of ZV results in a self-limiting mild illness characterized by rash, fever, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and arthritis [3] . Recently, evidence has indicated that ZV infection can be correlated with the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [4] . In addition, the isolation of ZV from the fetal brain and epidemiological information provide strong evidence that ZV infection is associated with microcephaly [5, 6] . At present, there are no specific curative treatments for ZV infection or approved vaccines to prevent ZV infection. Therefore, it is very important to develop a therapeutic approach or vaccine for ZV infection.",

It has been shown that the structure of mature ZV is arranged in a herringbone pattern with 90 antiparallel envelope dimers [9, 10] , similar to the structure of dengue virus [11, 12] . The dengue virus envelope protein contains three domains. This viral structural protein plays a key role in viral entry. Envelope protein domain III (E3) of dengue virus contains an immunoglobulin-like fold and contributes to viral attachment [13, 14] . Our previous studies have shown that E3 of dengue virus is a potential dengue vaccine candidate [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . It is very likely that antibodies against ZV E3 can neutralize ZV infection. Recently, ZVderived E3 [24, 25] , ZV-derived E3 displayed on immunogenic virus-like particles [26, 27] , or ZV-derived E3 fused with the Fc region of human IgG [28] was found to induce neutralizing immune responses against ZV when formulated with adjuvants. The neutralizing immunogenicity on neutralizing epitopes was further enhanced by masking of a non-neutralizing epitope surrounding residue 375 of ZV E3 [29] . Characterization of the human immune response to ZV infection revealed that the highly cross-reactive antibodies to envelope protein domain I/II induced by ZV or DV infection were poorly neutralizing but potently enhancing may pose a risk for heterologous ADE [30] . Thus, ZV E3 is a potential target for ZV vaccine development.",

According to these findings, we developed a technique for producing recombinant lipoproteins with high yields and applied this technology to the development of recombinant protein-based vaccines with superior immunogenicity [34] . In this study, we produced recombinant lipidated ZV E3 (rLZE3) and evaluated the potential of rLZE3 as a vaccine candidate against ZV.

A hexahistidine tag (His-tag) was added to the C-terminus of rZE3. For expression of rZE3, pZE3 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After transformation, the E. coli were cultured at 37\u00b0C overnight. To scale up protein production, 20 ml of the overnight culture was added to 1 L of medium in a 2-L shaker flask and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. When cultured to OD 600 = 0.6, isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG; 1 mM) was added, followed by an incubation for 20 h at 20\u00b0C to induce protein expression. The D1 domain and lipid signal peptide of the lipoprotein Ag473 [34] were cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pET-22b(+) to obtain the plasmid pLipo as previously described [35] .

The functionality of the rLZE3 lipid moiety was evaluated by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with rZE3 or rLZE3. The expression levels of CD40 and CD80 on the bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were examined by flow cytometry. rLZE3 increased the CD40 and CD80 expression levels, while rZE3 (without lipidation) did not enhance CD40 and CD80 expression (Fig. 2a) . In addition, we added polymyxin B to the stimulation to eliminate the effect of any minor residual endotoxin remaining after rZE3 or rLZE3 purification. It was evident that there were no substantial reduction effects of polymyxin B on stimulation with rZE3 or rLZE3. In contrast, adding polymyxin B abolished enhancing effects of LPS. The mean fluorescence intensity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells cultured without stimulation (PBS) was defined as the basal expression level. The relative mean fluorescence intensities from three independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 2b . These results indicate that the lipid moiety of rLZE3 leads to enhancement of the expression of CD40 and CD80. Furthermore, rLZE3 was able to stimulate the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12p40 by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. In the presence of polymyxin B, the production of cytokines was not eliminated. In contrast, rZE3 (the counterpart of rLZE3 that lacks lipidation) was unable to enhance cytokine production (Fig. 2c) . These results support the conclusion that rLZE3 stimulates bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.",

The frequencies of CD11c + MHC II + cells and antigen-containing CD11c + MHC II + cells in the inguinal lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 h after injection. The gating strategy and representative results are shown in Fig. 3a . Injection of rLZE3 elevated the frequency of CD11c + MHC II + cells in the inguinal lymph nodes compared with injection of rZE3 or PBS (Fig. 3b) . Furthermore, the frequency of antigen-containing CD11c + MHC II + cells also increased in the mice injected with rLZE3 (Fig. 3c) . These results suggest that the injection of rLZE3 can increase the dendritic cell frequency in draining lymph nodes and enhance antigen uptake by dendritic cells.

We showed that rLZE3 could be readily prepared with an E. coli-based system (Fig. 1 ) and that immunization with rLZE3 could elicit durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Several studies have reported that ZV E3 contains epitopes recognized by strong neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [30, [36] [37] [38] [39] , suggesting that ZV E3 is a potential target that can trigger neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with these findings, our results show that rLZE3 potently induces specific neutralizing antibodies against ZV in mice (Figs. 4b and 5 ). Notably, we demonstrated that passive transfer of rLZE3-immunized mouse sera reduced viremia levels (Fig. 6a) and prolonged survival times (Fig. 6b) in recipient mice Fig. 5 Neutralizing antibody responses induced by rLZE3 do not cross-neutralize dengue-2 virus. Groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) were immunized subcutaneously with PBS, rZE3, or rLZE3 (10 \u03bcg per dose) twice at a two-week interval. Live Zika virus or dengue-2 virus was injected intraperitoneally in parallel. Serum samples were collected from immunized mice at 8 weeks after the first immunization. The Zika virus-or dengue-2 virus-neutralizing capacity of the serum samples was determined by FRNT. The neutralizing antibody titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that resulted in a 50% reduction in FFUs compared to the FFUs of control samples containing the virus alone challenged with ZV. Similar observations have been made in other studies [40, 41] . Collectively, these results suggest that neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in providing protective immunity against ZV infection.",

Adjuvants are often required in proteinbased subunit vaccine formulations to enhance the antigen-specific immune response. It has been shown that E. coli-produced recombinant lipidated antigens are efficiently captured by dendritic cells [35] . In addition, these recombinant lipidated antigens can also stimulate dendritic cell activation and further enhance antigenspecific immune responses [18-20, 34, 35] . In agreement with these findings, our results showed that rLZE3 but not its nonlipidated counterpart could stimulate dendritic cells to increase the expression of CD40 and CD80 ( Fig. 2a and b) and enhance the production of cytokines (Fig. 2c) . We further demonstrated that mice injected with rLE3 exhibited increased frequencies of not only dendritic cells in the draining lymph node but also antigen-loaded dendritic cells (Fig. 3) . All of the abovementioned features of rLZE3 conferred robust immune responses. As a consequence, rLZE3 alone, without exogenous adjuvant, induced neutralizing antibodies superior to those induced by rZE3. These results suggest that use of a recombinant lipidated antigen is a potent strategy for protein-based subunit vaccine development.",

To address this issue, we further examined the capacities of sera from rZE3-, rLZE3-, ZV-, and DV2-immunized mice to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DV2 infection. Our results show that ZV-and DV2-immunized sera, but not rZE3-or rLZE3-immunized sera, exhibit great ADE capacities of DV2 infection (Additional file 2: Figure  S2 ).

Here, we show rLZE3 with intrinsic adjuvant also induces neutralizing antibodies and reduces risk of ADE.

Collectively, our results Fig. 6 Inhibition of viremia levels and prolongation of survival time in rLZE3-immunized mice. Groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 9-10/group) were immunized subcutaneously with PBS, rZE3, or rLZE3 (50 \u03bcg per dose) twice at a three-week interval. Serum samples were collected at 8-10 weeks after the first immunization. AG129 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.4 of mL sera from C57BL/6 mice that received different immunizations. After 6 h, the AG129 mice (n = 10/group) were intraperitoneally injected with 50 FFUs of Zika virus (PRVABC59) in 0.2 mL of PBS. a The mice were bled 3 days after being challenged. The viral titers in the plasma were evaluated by focus-forming assays using Vero cells. The plasma virus titers were logarithmically transformed before statistical analyses. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SE of the mean. Statistical significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. *p < 0.05. b The overall survival of the mice is shown demonstrate that E. coli-produced rLZE3 is a potential ZV vaccine candidate worthy of further development.",

C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously with PBS, rZE3, or rLZE3 (10 \u03bcg per dose) twice at a two-week interval. Live Zika virus or dengue-2 virus was injected intraperitoneally in parallel. Serum samples were collected from immunized mice at 8 weeks after the first immunization. Antibody-mediated enhancement of dengue virus infectivity was determined by flow cytometry in K562 cells. Sera were diluted via 4-fold serial dilutions (starting at 1\u22364), and the sera were heatinactivated prior to testing. Serially diluted sera and virus were mixed and incubated to form immune complexes for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. K562 cells were mixed with immune complexes (MOI = 0.1) and then incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing, the cells were resuspended in fresh medium and incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. Infections with and without virus were performed in parallel as controls. Cells were stained for intracellular with monoclonal antidengue antibodies (American Type Culture Collection, No. HB-114 for dengue-2). Antibody-labeled cells were detected with a secondary antibody conjugated to FITC. The data were acquired with CellQuest Pro software on a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer and were analyzed with FCS Express software. ",
