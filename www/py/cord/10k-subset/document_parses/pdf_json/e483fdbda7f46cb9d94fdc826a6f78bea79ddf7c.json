A complex network 2-5 is taken as a graph with directed edges and associated weights, which are represented in terms of the weight matrix W. The N nodes in the network are numbered as i =1,2, ... ,N, and a directed edge with weight M, extending from node j to node i, is represented as W\u0351i , j\u0352 = M. No self-connections \u0351loops\u0352 are considered. The in and out strengths of a node i, abbreviated as is\u0351i\u0352 and os\u0351i\u0352, correspond to the sum of the weights of its in-and outbound connections, respectively. The stochastic matrix S for such a network is",

In the steady state \u0351i.e., after a long time period T\u0352, v = Sv and the frequency of visits to each node along the random walk may be calculated in terms of the eigenvector associated with the unit eigenvalue \u0351e.g., Ref. 6\u0352.

More specifically, as time progresses, the frequency of visits to each network node approaches the activity values which would be obtained by the traditional diffusion equation. A full congruence between such frequencies and activity diffusion is obtained at the equilibrium state of the random walk process. Therefore, random walks are also directly related to the important phenomenon of diffusion, which plays an important role in a large number of linear and nonlinear dynamic systems including disease spreading and pattern formation. Random walks are also intrinsically connected to Markov chains, electrical circuits, and flows in networks, and even dynamical models such as Ising. For such reasons, random walks have become one of the most important and general models of dynamics in physics and other areas, constituting a primary choice for investigating dynamics in complex networks.",

Then os= is= v, implying full correlation between frequency of visits and both in and out strengths. An implication of this derivation is that for perfectly correlated networks, the frequency of symbols produced by random walks will be equal to the out strength or in strength distributions. Therefore, an out strength scale-free 3 network must produce sequences obeying Zipf's law 7 and vice versa. If, on the other hand, the node distribution is Gaussian, the frequency of visits to nodes will also be a Gaussian function; that is to say, the distribution of nodes is replicated in the node activation. Although the correlation between node strength and random walk dynamics in undirected networks has been established before 8 \u0351including full correlation 9,10 \u0352, the findings reported here are more general since they are related to any directed weighted network, such as the WWW and the airport network. Indeed, the correlation conditions for undirected networks can be understood as a particular case of the conditions above.",

            "text": "We obtained r for various real networks \u0351Table I\u0352, including the fully correlated networks mentioned above. To interpret these data, we recall that a small r means that a hub \u0351large in or out strength\u0352 in topology is not necessarily a center of activity. Notably, in all cases considered r is greater for the in strength than for the out strength. This may be understood with a trivial example of a node from which a high number of links emerge \u0351implying large out strength\u0352 but which has only very few inbound links. This node, in a random walk model, will be rarely occupied and thus cannot be a center of activity, though it will strongly affect the rest of the network by sending activation to many other targets. Understanding why a hub in terms of in strength may fail to be very active is more subtle. Consider a central node receiving links from many other nodes arranged in a circle, i.e., the central node has a large in strength but with the surrounding nodes possessing small in strength. In other words, if a node i receives several links from nodes with low activity, this node i will likewise be fairly inactive. In order to further analyze the latter case, we may examine the correlations between the frequency of visits to each node i and the cumulative hierarchical in and out strengths of that node. The hierarchical degree 17-19 of a network node provides a natural extension of the traditional concept of node degree. The im-TABLE I.

Because the Pearson coefficient corresponds to a single real value, it cannot adequately express the coexistence of the many relationships between activity and degrees present in this specific network as well as possibly heterogeneous topologies. Very similar results were obtained for other WWW networks, which indicate that the reasons why topological hubs have not been highly active cannot be identified at the present moment \u0351see, however, discussion for higher correlated networks below\u0352.",

In the cat cortical network, each cortical region is represented as a node, and the interconnections are reflected by the network edges. Significantly, in a previous paper, 26 it was shown that when connections between cortex and thalamus were included, the correlation between activity and outdegree increased significantly. This could be interpreted as a result of increased efficiency with the topological hubs becoming highly active. Furthermore, for the fully correlated networks, such as word associations obtained for texts by Darwin and Wodehouse, activity increased basically with the square of the cumulative second hierarchical in strength \u0351see Supplementary Fig. 2 . in Ref. 20\u0352 . In addition, the correlations obtained for these two authors are markedly distinct, as the work of Wodehouse is characterized by substantially steeper increase of frequency of visits for large in strength values \u0351see Supplementary Fig. 3 in Ref. 20\u0352. Therefore, the results considering higher cumulative hierarchical degrees may serve as a feature for authorship identification.",

Result \u0351i\u0352 is of fundamental importance for studies relating the dynamics and connectivity in networks, with critical practical implications. For instance, it not only demonstrates that hubs of connectivity may not correspond to hubs of activity but also provides a sufficient condition for achieving full correlation. Result \u0351ii\u0352 is also of fundamental importance as it relates two of the most important concepts in complex systems, namely, Zipf's law and scale-free networks. Even though sharing the feature of power law, these two key concepts had been extensively studied on their own. The result reported in this work paves the way for important additional investigations, especially by showing that Zipf's law may be a consequence of dynamics taking place in scalefree systems. In the cases where the network is not fully correlated, the Pearson coefficient may be used as a characterizing parameter. For a network with very small correlation, such as the WWW links between the pages in a New Zealand domain analyzed here, the reasons for hubs failing to be active could not be identified, probably because of the substantially higher complexity and heterogeneity of this network, including varying levels of clustering coefficients, as compared to the neuronal networks.",
