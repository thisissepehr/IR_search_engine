Viral nucleic acids are sensed by transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytoplasmic DNA sensors, and RNA helicases, resulting in the activation of kinases to initiate signaling cascade [16] . The kinases activate NF-B, IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors to induce their subsequent translocation into the nucleus where they promote IFN gene transcription [17] . The complex of IRF3 and NF-B stimulates expression of IFN-and IFN-1, while the complex of IRF7 and NF-B stimulates the expression of IFN-and IFN-2 and IFN-3 [18] . Once produced, Types I and III IFNs translocate from the nucleus to the cytomembrane to bind their receptors, respectively, to activate the overlapping Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Type I IFNs use a dimeric receptor (IFNAR) composed of subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c, whereas Type III IFNs signal through a different receptor, which is composed of IL-28Ra and IL10Ra. After IFNs bind to their specific receptors, the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, JAK1, TYK2, are activated to further simulate phosphorylation of STAT proteins. On the one hand, activated STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-9 form a heterotrimeric transcription factor complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 is then translocated into the nucleus where it binds to sequences of IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) present in the promoter region of numerous interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [19] . On the other hand, a homodimer STAT1 (gamma interferon activation factor, GAF) is formed and translocated into the nucleus where it binds to GAS (gamma interferon activation site) to induce ISGs expression [20, 21] . The proteins encoded by these ISGs have different biological functions. Some mediate a myriad of antiviral activities, such as ISG15, MxA, and OAS. Several ISG-encode proteins like IRF7, IRF3 amplify IFNs production through a positive feedback [22] .

They translocate to nucleus to form heterodimers, respectively, which can catalyze transcription of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-genes by binding to specific DNA sequences. Then, Types I and III IFNs move out of nucleus to bind to their specific receptors on the cell membrane and trigger an overlap pathway, Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Upon binding to their cognate receptors, Type I can phosphorylate both STAT1 and STAT2 to form ISGF3 that binds to ISRE in the promoter region of ISGs to upregulate their transcription and Type III IFN also can phosphorylate STAT1 to form a homodimer GAF and induce ISGs expression with GAS in the promoter region.

The recently successful developments of numerous well-tolerated oral agents that target viral proteins to interfere with viral replication and direct antiviral agents (DAAs) increase SVR in patients infected with HCV [27] . There are four major groups of DAAs: NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PIs), NS5B nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NPIs), NS5B nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NNPIs), and NS5A inhibitors [28] . In 2011, the first DAAs telaprevir and boceprevir were approved by FDA. Combined with PEG-IFN/ribavirin treatment, these DAAs significantly increased the SVR up to 80% for the most prevalent HCV genotype 1 infected patients although they had marginal improvement of SVR in other genotypes [29, 30] . Currently, several promising DAAs are already in clinical trials as a monotherapy to translate the dream of a pill to cure HCV into reality (reviewed in [31] ). FDA approved first the monopill, Harvoni (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir), without combination of interferon or ribavirin to treat HCV genotype 1 infection in October 2014. Indeed, IFNfree regimen is beneficial for patients with poor tolerance to IFN and/or who have suffered from extensive side effects.

As a consequence, IFN-s, which trigger the overlapping Jak/STAT signaling pathway with IFN through distinct IFN-R1 expressed only in restricted tissues [33] , seem an ideal therapeutic candidate for HCV therapy. A more limited target cell range would be of great importance for the possible regimen applications of IFN-s. Refractory state occurs commonly in cultured cells and in the liver through repeated stimulation with IFN- [34] , which is believed to be one of the reasons for nonresponse to the treatment with IFN--based therapy in HCV-infected patients [35] . Surprisingly, IFN-did not induce such a refractory state in liver cells [36] . That might be because tolerance of IFN--based therapy correlated with refractoriness of NK cells [37] where no expression of IFN-R1 was detected [38] . Although selective distribution of the IFN-receptors would reduce the number of potential medical indications, fewer side effects would represent a big advantage over type I IFNs [39] .

Interestingly, patients with upregulation of ISGs in liver cells prior to receiving interferon treatment respond less well to interferon and are much more likely to have the unfavorable IL-28B genotype [45, 46] .

Currently, a rapid virological response (RVR) at week 4 of therapy has been identified as an important predictor of SVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 [55] or genotype 2 [56] . Meanwhile, more studies are looking for much earlier viral response after initiation of therapy to predict SVR [57] , and even a prediction model was used [58] . In addition, HCV gene mutations also contribute to treatment response, of which the hot spot of mutation was focused on viral nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A). At least 3 functional domains of NS5A were involved in IFN resistance: ISDR (Interferon Sensitivity-Determining Region), PKRBD (PKR Binding Domain), and V3 (Variable region 3) at the C terminus [59] . Enomoto et al. further demonstrated that 4 or more mutations in the NS5A region (known as \"mutant type\") were associated with high SVR rate in Japanese patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1b [60] .

Although the core region of HCV is conserved, mutations of amino acid (aa) 70 and aa 91 affected SVR rate [63, 64] .

Therefore, the expression level of ISGs in pretreatment liver or blood seems to be useful for prediction of treatment outcomes in patients with HCV.

Therefore, they independently uncovered the influence of IL-28B SNP on treatment-induced and spontaneous HCV clearance. The first landmark research facilitated by GWAS was published in 2009 [44] . Ge's group assessed the treatment outcome in a group of 1671 HCV genotype 1 patients with treatment of injecting PEG-IFN/RBV.

In addition, they further compared the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV treatment in association with IL-28B genotype in different ethnicity. They concluded that more favorable IL-28B genotype was found in European than African populations, which explain higher SVR in European-Americans to some extent. However, compared with factors associated with viral clearance, host IFN-3 genotype was more important than baseline viral load, the degree of liver fibrosis, or ethnicity. In subsequent years, different researches drew consistent conclusion that SNPs of IL-28B is strongly associated with HCV treatment outcomes [76, 77] . In addition, the verdict was extended to both HCV monoinfected and HCV/HIV coinfected populations. They revealed that the minor allele of Rs8099917 was identified in 58% of patients who did not respond to treatment and defined as a risk factor related to progression to chronic HCV infection, regardless of the coinfection with HIV or not [78] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 639, "end": 643, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1597, "text": "[76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1601, "text": "77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1947, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Interleukin-28B (IL-28B) Genotype and SVR."}, {"text": "Recently, a new variant of IFN-4, denoted as ss469415590 (TT/\u0394G) has been discovered, whose \u0394G allele is strongly associated with impaired spontaneous HCV clearance as a result of high expression of IL-28B [47] . Interestingly, \u0394G allele of ss469415590 expressed a novel IFN-4, which could block the activity of Types I and III IFNs, decreasing the capacity of HCV clearance [79] . However, the mechanism of its negative regulation of IFNs signaling pathway was elusive. Considering poorly expression and antiviral activity of IFN-4, impeding receptor binding of other members of the IFN-family is a possible explanation [80] . In any event, ss469415590 sounds like a better predictor of SVR than the traditional rs12979860. However, the predictive effect of ss469415590 is still controversial (Table 1) . Therefore, although the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of them currently identified are too low to be clinically useful alone, these studies confirmed a significant association between IFN-4 genetic variation and response to treatment.
