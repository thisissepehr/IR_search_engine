This paper examines the most regularly used and preferred cricothyrotomy devices on the market, suggests critical design specifications for improving cricothyrotomy devices, introduces a new cricothyrotomy device, and performs an engineering evaluation of the device's critical components. Through a review of literature, manufacturer products, and patents, four principal cricothyrotomy devices currently in clinical use were identified. From the review, the Cook\u2122 Melker device is the preferred method of clinicians but the device has acknowledged problems. A new emergency needle cricothyrotomy device (ENCD) was developed to address all design specifications identified in literature. Engineering, theoretical, and experimental assessments were performed. In situ evaluations of a prototype of the new device using porcine specimens to assess insertion, extraction, and cyclic force capabilities were performed. The device was very successful in its evaluation. Further discussion focuses on these aspects and a comparison of the new device with established devices. The proposed emergency needle cricothyrotomy device performed very well.

One procedure used to provide an entryway for such ventilation is cricothyrotomy. A cricothyrotomy is performed by inserting a needle into the trachea via the cricothyroid membrane, where ventilation is provided by either low pressure ventilation \u0351at ambient atmospheric pressure, achieved by a hand pump\u0352 or with high pressure jet systems \u0351at \u03f3400 kPa \u035150 psi\u0352\u0352 \u03532\u0354. While treatment may depend on the severity of the injury, treatment procedures have not been standardized \u03533\u0354. Some of the known complications of the procedure are as follows: \u0351a\u0352 airway trauma due to incorrect directionality of air, which if not directed toward the lungs may force out the tube or cause additional trauma to the airway wall and fill lungs with blood; \u0351b\u0352 tube slipping out during treatment or patient motion/struggle; \u0351c\u0352 tube insertion difficulty after airway puncture; \u0351d\u0352 airway wall trauma caused by the needle or due to the tube whipping during the air burst; and \u0351e\u0352 pulmonary barotrauma due to excessive generation of airway pressure \u0351particularly if high pressure jet ventilation is employed\u0352.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The majority of currently available devices use low pressure ventilation methods and typically the insertion process involves multiple steps.
