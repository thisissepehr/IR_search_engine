In addition, experimental and clinical studies identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as a risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of antifungal treatment on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchial colonization due to P. aeruginosa. Design and setting: Retrospective observational case-control study conducted in a 30-bed ICU during a 1-year period. Patients and methods: One hundred and two patients intubated and ventilated for longer than 48 h with tracheobronchial colonization by Candida spp. Routine screening for Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa was performed at ICU admission and weekly. Antifungal treatment was based on medical staff decisions. Patients with P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were matched (1:2) with patients without P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization. In case and control patients, risk factors for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Thirty-six patients (35%) received antifungal treatment. Nineteen patients (18%) developed a P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization, and all were successfully matched. Antifungal treatment [31% vs 60%; p = 0.037, OR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.45-0.90)], and duration of antifungal treatment (7 \u00b1 11 vs 14 \u00b1 14 days; p = 0.045, in case and control patients respectively) were significantly associated with reduced risk for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the impact of antifungal treatment on Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa interaction. Several studies have identified pathogenic interactions between microorganisms, such as herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus; influenza virus and P. aeruginosa; and C. albicans and P. aeruginosa [5, 9, 10] . Theses interactions have major environmental and medical consequences. A pathogenic interaction between C. albicans and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated in experimental studies. Recent P. aeruginosa infection has been identified as a risk factor for fatal candidiasis in burned mice [11] . Molecular studies identified phylogenetic similarities between the two pathogens [5, 6] . The morphology and virulence of C. albicans are significantly affected by the presence of P. aeruginosa [5] . A cell-cell signaling molecule capable of inhibiting C. albicans filamentation is produced by P. aeruginosa [5] . P. aeruginosa forms a dense biofilm on C. albicans filaments and kills the fungus. In contrast, P. aeruginosa neither binds nor kills yeast-form C. albicans. Several P. aeruginosa virulence factors that are important in disease are involved in killing of C. albicans filaments [5] . Azoulay et al. [8] recently reported the results of the first clinical study suggesting an interaction between C. albicans and P. aeruginosa. The authors identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as an independent risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. No cause-andeffect relationship was demonstrated in that study. In addition, Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization and P. aeruginosa pneumonia could both be a consequence of prior antibiotic treatment. However, the lack of association with Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, another consequence of antibiotic treatment, indicates that an association between Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization and P. aeruginosa remains plausible. A more recent experimental study has evaluated the impact of C. albicans tracheobronchial colonization on the occurrence of P. aeruginosa pneumonia [12] . Rate of P. aeruginosa pneumonia was significantly higher in rats with C. albicans tracheobronchial colonization as compared with rats without C. albicans tracheobronchial colonization (33% vs 4%, p < 0.05).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 496, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 497, "end": 499, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 500, "end": 503, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 880, "end": 883, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 884, "end": 886, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 993, "end": 996, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1110, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1393, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1414, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2256, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although antifungal treatment was associated with reduced risk for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization, no significant relationship was found between antifungal treatment and P. aeruginosa VAP.

Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to other ICUs. Fourth, no information was available on the nature of prior antibiotic treatment or and on the quantity of Candida spp. in respiratory specimens. In addition, invasive methods were not used to diagnose VAP. However, quantitative tracheal aspirate culture was used in all patients with a high threshold (\u2265 10 6 cfu/ml). Postmortem studies showed acceptable overall diagnostic accuracy of quantitative tracheal aspirate compared with bronchoalveolar lavage or protected specimen brush [15] . Finally, antifungal treatment was based on medical staff decisions. Among the 36 patients who received antifungals, 19 patients received preemptive antifungal treatment. This finding is consistent with the results of a recent survey conducted in French ICUs [16] . However, recovery of Candida spp. from the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients without risk factors for immunosuppression is common and frequently reflects a tracheobronchial colonization [17, 18] .
