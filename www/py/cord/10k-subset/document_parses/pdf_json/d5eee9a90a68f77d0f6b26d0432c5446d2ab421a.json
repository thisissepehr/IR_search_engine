Avian influenza strains were not recognized to infect species other than birds and swine until 1996, when a single case of conjunctivitis was reported, and 1997, when the first significant human outbreak occurred in Hong Kong. Since 1996, there have been three significant human outbreaks and 164 confirmed human infections with avian influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry has reached epidemic proportions in eight Southeast Asian countries, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of chickens, through infection or culling, and huge economic losses. Mutation of the genome and/or genetic reassortment resulting in antigenic shift in avian viruses sets the stage for the emergence of a highly pathogenic strain with pandemic potential. It has been estimated that the next influenza pandemic will result in 207,000 deaths and 734,000 hospitalizations in the United States alone [1] . Avian influenza, especially H5N1, is the infectious agent that is most likely to cause a pandemic, leading to massive fatalities worldwide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1010, "end": 1013, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The influenza viruses, types A, B, and C, belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza A is the only type with veterinary significance. The virus is enveloped and contains a genome of eight RNA segments. The segmented genome allows viruses from different species to recombine RNA segments, leading to reassorted virus with surface proteins to which humans are nonimmune. These major changes in glycoproteins, called antigenic shifts, are associated with epidemics and pandemics. Minor changes, or antigenic drifts, are usually associated with annual outbreaks. Antigenic drift results from high mutation rates in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, caused by the poor proofreading ability of RNA polymerase, resulting in amino acid substitutions and quasi-species with optimal chances for environmental adaptation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virology"}, {"text": "Influenza A has two major antigenic surface proteins embedded in the membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that are essential for viral attachment and cellular release. HA enables attachment to new cells via binding to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cells. HA monomers are cleaved by trypsinlike enzymes, which results in a conformational change that activates membrane fusion and entry into acidified endosomes. Cleavability and invasion are impaired by having a carbohydrate side chain at this cleavage site and enhanced by having multiple basic residues directly upstream from this site. HA variability, including extensive post-translational glycosylation, allows evasion of host immune responses. After viral replication, progeny virions are bound to the host cell and cleaved by neuraminidase to liberate new virions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virology"}, {"text": "There are three subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1-H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidase (N1 and N2) that circulate in humans.
