is associated with decreased relapse incidence (RI) and improved leukemia-free survival (LFS) after haploidentical and HLA-mismatched unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We assessed outcomes of 218 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML n \u00bc 94) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n \u00bc 124) in complete remission (CR) who had received a single-unit unrelated cord blood transplant (UCBT) from a KIR-ligand-compatible or -incompatible donor. Grafts were HLA-A, -B or -DRB1 matched (n \u00bc 21) or mismatched (n \u00bc 197). Patients and donors were categorized according to their degree of KIR-ligand compatibility in the graft-versus-host direction by determining whether or not they expressed HLA-C group 1 or 2, HLA-Bw4 or HLA-A3/-A11. Both HLA-C/-B KIR-ligand-and HLA-A-A3/-A11 KIR-ligand-incompatible UCBT showed a trend to improved LFS (P \u00bc 0.09 and P \u00bc 0.13, respectively). Sixty-nine donor-patient pairs were HLA-A, -B or -C KIR-ligand incompatible and 149 compatible.

These results were more evident for AML transplant recipients (2-year LFS and RI with or without KIR-ligand incompatibility 73 versus 38% (P \u00bc 0.012), and 5 versus 36% (P \u00bc 0.005), respectively). UCBT for acute leukemia in CR from KIR-ligandincompatible donors is associated with decreased RI and improved LFS and OS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from family, unrelated bone marrow or cord blood donors is a curative treatment for a considerable number of patients with acute leukemia. Major histocompatibility complex-restricted donor T cells play an important role in HLA-matched as well as HLA-mismatched HSCT by recognizing differences in minor and major histocompatibility antigens between donor and recipient. 1, 2 A novel mechanism that relies on interactions between donor natural killer (NK) cells and recipient cells was demonstrated in the setting of haploidentical family donor HSCT. [3] [4] [5] NK cells express on their surface inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that recognize allotypic determinants ('KIR ligands') shared by certain HLA class I allele groups. KIR2DL1 recognizes HLA-C alleles with a Lys 80 residue (HLA-Cw4 and related, 'group 2' alleles), KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 recognize HLA-C with an Asn 80 residue (HLA-Cw3 and related, 'group 1' alleles); KIR3DL1 is the receptor for HLA-B alleles sharing the Bw4 supertypic specificity. [3] [4] [5] Finally, KIR3DL2 was shown to function as a receptor for HLA-A3/-A11 alleles when bound to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) peptides. 6 The role of KIR and KIR ligand in the context of HSCT has been investigated over the past 10 years. In transplants that are KIR-ligand mismatched in the graft-versus-host (GvH) direction, donor NK cells expressing inhibitory KIRs, which do not recognize ligand(s) on recipient targets, are released from HLA inhibition and mediate alloreactions leading to clinically significant graft-versus-leukemia effects. Clinical studies in haploidentical [7] [8] [9] and in some (un)related donor transplants [10] [11] [12] showed that KIR-ligand incompatibilities in the GvH direction are associated with a decreased incidence of relapse and improved disease-free and overall survival (OS) after HSCT. Several unrelated donor transplant studies did not, however, report any effect. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Umbilical cord blood units from unrelated donors constitute another well-established source of stem cells for HSCT in patients with leukemias. The main advantages are rapid availability and the possibility to perform HLA-mismatched transplantations due to a relatively low risk of severe GvH disease (GvHD) [18] [19] [20] [21] that increases considerably the probability of finding a suitable donor. Moreover, outcomes after umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBTs) are comparable with those after unrelated bone marrow transplantation in children and adults with acute leukemias. 19, 21 We hypothesized that in the setting of HLA-mismatched UCBT, NK-cell alloreactivity might come into play and influence outcomes. From the Eurocord database we retrieved all patients who had received a single-unit UCBT for acute leukemia in complete remission (CR). We grouped transplants according to the presence or absence of KIR-ligand mismatches that were shown to trigger donor-versus-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity in haploidentical transplantation, that is mismatches for HLA-C group 1, HLA-C group 2 and the HLA-Bw4 allele group. Moreover, as HLA-A3/-A11 KIR-ligand mismatches were not encountered in haploidentical transplants, we decided to include them in our evaluation. As HLA-A3/-A11 alleles were reported to function as KIR ligands when bound to EBV peptides, we hypothesized that, in view of the frequent EBV reactivation after transplantation, EBV peptides were readily available for HLA-A3/-A11 binding, with the possible generation of HLA-A3/-A11-specific donor NK cells that were alloreactive against target cells from recipients lacking HLA-A3 and/or HLA-A11.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 427, "end": 429, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 430, "end": 431, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 607, "end": 610, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1095, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1099, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1103, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1231, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1680, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1684, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1735, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1740, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1745, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2009, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2024, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2029, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2341, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2346, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2347, "end": 2351, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2614, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2617, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This retrospective analysis is based on data reported to the Eurocord Registry from European and non-European centers through a standardized questionnaire concerning patient, cord blood units, disease and graft characteristics, as well as transplant outcomes.

During the last 10 years, the understanding of NK-cell alloreactivity is rapidly expanding, and thus the methods, utilized through the years, to determine KIR mismatch, vary largely. Mismatches between donor KIR ligand and recipient KIR ligand in the GvH direction (the donor-recipient KIR-ligand model) have been used by the Perugia group and Hsu et al., [7] [8] [9] 12, 22 between donor KIR and recipient KIR by Gagne et al. 28 and between donor KIR and recipient KIR ligand by Leung et al. 29, 30 Criticizing the donor-recipient KIR-ligand model one could argue that, as some donors might not have possessed the relevant KIR gene, a minority of donor-recipient pairs might have been misclassified in this study.

Moreover, the risk of misclassification arises when the donor does not possess/express the relevant KIR to exert alloreactivity. Under this circumstance, KIR-ligand mismatching mistakenly classifies a non-NK-alloreactive transplant pair as NK alloreactive. Therefore, in our series, such 'false positives' might have 'contaminated/diluted' the NK-alloreactive cohort.

These two types of SCT have in common that the donors are highly HLA mismatched with the recipient, whereas after SCT, relatively little severe GvHD is observed. The post-transplant period is further characterized by a rapid recovery of NK cells and longlasting T-cell immunoincompetence. As T cells in the cord blood graft are antigen inexperienced, they contain few or no cytotoxic T cells directed against viral and bacterial peptides, which may cross-react with HLA alloantigens. The relative lack of post-thymic T cells and the T-cell naivety may be responsible for the lower-than expected frequency of severe GvHD, even in the setting of one or two HLA mismatches, and for the delayed recovery of T-cell function after UCBT [31] [32] [33] to the same degree as after haploidentical SCT. Lack of memory T cells in the graft (due to T-cell depletion in haploidentical and T-cell naivety in cord blood transplants) apparently permits the recovery of fully functional NK cells. Interestingly, one study comparing T celldepleted-versus-repleted unrelated donor transplants demonstrated that T cells in the graft adversely affected reconstitution of KIR-bearing NK cells and clinical outcomes. 34 Additional evidence that T cells antagonize reconstitution of potentially alloreactive, KIR-bearing NK cells derives from several other unrelated donor transplant studies, using T-cellreplete grafts. 10, 11, [13] [14] [15] 33, 35 Most studies showed no advantage in transplantation from KIR-ligand-mismatched donors, [13] [14] [15] 30, 31, [36] [37] [38] whereas a few observed an increased graft-versus-leukemia effect. 10, 11, [39] [40] [41] In haploidentical 29, 30 , matched sibling 12 and unrelated donor transplants, 36 the 'missing ligand' model was proposed as a powerful algorithm for predicting favorable transplant outcomes. It hypothesizes that alloreactions also occur when KIR-ligand-matched donors possess KIR(s) for which neither donor nor recipient has an HLA ligand(s). These donors were shown to carry KIR-bearing NK cells in an anergic/regulated state. 42 The 'missing ligand' model proposes that, upon transfer into the recipient, they may become activated and exert a graftversus-leukemia effect.
