However, the presence of hMPV has been detected in 2-4% of adult patients admitted due to a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [8, 9] and has been associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [10] [11] [12] . The same as with other common respiratory viruses, hMPV is usually associated with non-severe pneumonia, whereas risk factors like immunosuppression, specific comorbidities-chronic lung disease, heart disease, blood disorders-elderly and living in long-term care facilities are associated with a higher risk of severe viral pneumonia [13, 14] . Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that hMPV infection is an underappreciated cause of critical illness, also in previously healthy patients [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Molecular characterization of hMPV revealed group dominance of subgroup B. HMPV infection presented seasonal distribution, with 2/3 of cases detected in late winter-early spring each year. The 32% of the studied patients were younger than 65 years without comorbidities. HMPV CAP often presented as acute respiratory failure with bilateral opacities and half of ICU subjects underwent mechanical ventilation. Lymphocytopenia and pleural effusion were common at admission. Plasma procalcitonin was a sensitive tool to identify coinfection with bacteria (25%), which contributes to antimicrobial stewardship.

Moreover, there are sporadic reports of 3-6 patients with hMPV infection acquired in the community and acute respiratory failure who required ICU admission [15] [16] [17] . In a large prospective study of ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, hMPV was more frequently detected in patients admitted by severe respiratory infection than in patients with other causes, suggesting a causal role of HMPV in the development of severe respiratory infection [24] . Most of the patients of this study had major comorbidities at admission, mainly chronic respiratory failure and immunosuppression, being those patients and the elderly the most susceptible to develop severe hMPV infections [2, 10, 14] . However, 60% of the patients were younger than 65 years old and one out of three did not have major comorbidities, being similar to CAP related to other etiologies. Interestingly, three patients (10.7%) were young adult patients without comorbidities and without bacterial coinfection that developed ARDS pointing out a main role of hMPV in the etiology of severe respiratory infections requiring mechanical ventilation.

The retrospective design of the study can underestimate the actual incidence of hMPV infection because some patients admitted because of acute respiratory infection could not be investigated for viral etiology. However, from the 2009 influenza pandemics, nasopharyngeal swab samples with respiratory viral detection are routine of care being collected in the 90% of patients with SCAP admitted to ICU.
