We screened 226 staff members at a regional Australian hospital (146 doctors and 80 medical students) between January 2013 and March 2014. The main outcomes of interest were the types of microorganisms and the amount of contamination of the mobile phones. This study found a high level of bacterial contamination (n = 168/226, 74%) on the mobile phones of staff members in a tertiary hospital, with similar organisms isolated from the staff member's dominant hand and mobile phones. While most of the isolated organisms were normal skin flora, a small percentage were potentially pathogenic (n = 12/226, 5%). Being a junior medical staff was found to be a risk factor for heavy microbial growth (OR 4.00, 95% CI 1.54, 10.37). Only 31% (70/226) of our participants reported cleaning their phones routinely, and only 21% (47/226) reported using alcohol containing wipes on their phones. This study demonstrates that mobile phones are potentially vehicles for pathogenic bacteria in a hospital setting. Only a minority of our participants reported cleaning their phones routinely. Disinfection guidelines utilizing alcohol wipes should be developed and implemented.",

(1, 2) Healthcare workers (HCW) play a crucial role in the transmission of bacteria to hospitalized patients, and as early as 1861 Semmelweis showed that contaminated hands of healthcare workers transmitted bacteria to patients. (3) Strict hygiene standards to prevent nosocomial infection are of paramount importance in a hospital setting. (4) Mobile phone use in hospitals has been discouraged until recently due to concerns over potential interference with medical equipment. (5) However, these concerns have now been shown to be largely unfounded, (6) and mobile phones have become an essential part of the hospital environment. Most doctors and students in hospitals across the world now rely on mobile phones as their main means of communication and as a source of information. (7) As with other environmental surfaces, prior studies have suggested that mobile phones may serve as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria. (8, 9) They come into close contact with various parts of the body and at the moment no cleaning guidelines exist in most hospitals. In our pilot study conducted in a pediatric unit, we found that 95% of phones were colonized with bacteria, and 5% contained pathogenic bacteria. (10) We also found that being a medical student was an independent risk factor for heavy microbial growth. The hygiene risk involved in using mobile phones in a hospital setting has not yet been determined in an Australian setting.",

We also found that interns were more likely to have heavy growth of bacteria on their mobile phones. There were no other risk factors for the presence of bacterial growth, heavy bacterial growth or growth of pathogens. Among those that cleaned their phones with alcohol daily, there was no growth of pathogens on their phone. We believe that our study is the first to suggest that there may be greater contamination of mobile phones used by junior medical staff, specifically interns. This association remained significant even after adjustment for other variables. In our pilot study in a pediatric setting, (10) we found that medical students had greater odds of heavy growth. In both settings the association remained significant after adjustment for other variables. Other potential risk factors (gender, phone use frequency, phone type, cleaning patterns) were not associated with the presence of bacteria, heavy bacterial growth, or the growth of pathogenic bacteria. This is consistent with the results of most studies in this area. (12, 13) Lee et al. (14) reported that smartphones had greater odds compared to non-smartphones for harbouring pathogenic bacteria, while Ustun et al. (15) reported that ICU staff had greater odds of contamination with E.coli. This was not seen in our study.",

However, we found that of those that cleaned their phones daily with alcohol, there was no growth of pathogenic bacteria. This raises the possibility that while phones may become quickly colonized with nonpathogenic bacteria such as skin flora, daily alcohol cleaning may reduce the chances of harboring pathogenic bacteria. However, given the small number of participants who cleaned their phones daily with alcohol, this result warrants further examination.",
