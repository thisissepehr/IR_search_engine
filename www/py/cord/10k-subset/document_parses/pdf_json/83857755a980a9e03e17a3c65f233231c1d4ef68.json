Major mucosal effector immune mechanisms include secretory antibodies, largely of immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype, cytotoxic T cells, as well as cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. Immiinologic unresponsiveness (tolerance) is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, and deliberate vaccination or natural immunization by a mucosal route can effectively induce immune suppression. The diverse compartments located in the aerodigestive and genitourinary tracts and exocrine glands communicate via preferential homing of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. Mucosal administration of antigens may resuh in tbe concomitant expression of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) antibody responses in various mucosal tissues and secretions, and under certain conditions, in the suppression of immune responses. Thus, developing formulations based on efficient delivery of selected antigens/tolero gens, cytokines and adjuvants may impact on the design of future vaccines and of specific immunotberapeutic approaches against diseases associated with untoward immune responses, sucb as autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and tissue-damaging inflammatory reactions triggered by persistent microorganisms.",

In addition, a large and highly specialized immune system protects these surfaces and thereby also tbe body interior against potential insults from the environment. In a healthy human adult, this local immune system contributes almost 80% of all immunocytes. These cells are accumulated in or in transit between various mucosal organs and glands and together they form tbe mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), the largest mammalian lymphoid organ system.",

At variance with tbe systemic immune apparatus, which functions in a normally sterile milieu and often responds vigorously to invaders, the MALT guards organs that are replete with foreign matter. It follows that upon encounter with this plethora of anligenic stimuli, tbe MALT must ignore such antigens, (5r economically select appropriate effector mechanisms and regulate their intensity to avoid bystander tissue damage and immunological exhaustion. Since this system cannot discriminate between pathogenic microorganisms on the one hand, and innocuous matter, such as dietary matter and commensal microorganisms, on tbe other, it is likely to recognize all foreign peptides. Elucidating the mechanisms that determine whether recognition of such diverse antigens will result in active immunity, immune suppression or ignorance, will have a major impact in the development of effective mucosal vaccines against infectious and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Although the immune apparatus is remarkably diverse, there is strong evidence that certain types of immune responses take place and are basically restricted to certain anatomic locations witbin tbe body. The MALT represents a well-known example of such a compartmentalized immunological system. As opposed to tbe central and peripheral lymphoid organs, the MALT contains inhomogeneously distributed B and T cells whose phenotype, repertoire, developmental origin, secretion products and hence probably also function are different. First, the prime immunoglobulin isotype produced and assembled in mucosal tissues is secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is only present in trace amounts in the intravascular compartment. Further, and although major species differences have been observed, non-conventional lymphocytes rarely seen in the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes are encountered at appreciable frequency in different mucosal locations, e.g. a/p TCR+CD4-CD8-cells, Y/5 TCR^CD4 CD8 a+CD8 p-and y/S TCR+CD4-CD8 a-CD8 p-T cells in the gut epithelium. The antigen receptor repertoire is also different in each location. Tbus, self-reactive T cells are detected among murine intestinal intraepithelial a/|i and 7/8 TCR\"^ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, in contrast to the T and B lymphocytes found in central and peripheral lymphoid organs, certain 7/8 and a/p T cells found in the mucosa, and presumably also mucosal CD5+ B cells, do not depend on the thymns or bone marrow for their development, respectively. In addition to divergent lineages that are driven to different organs by tissue-specific homing receptors, local selection mechanisms may he important in the diversifi-cation of mucosal immune responses. Selection may be exerted by local antigens, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) whose function varies in each anatomical location, cytokines, chemokines and cell-matrix interactions, thus leading to the expansion and maintenance of some clones, whereas others are diluted out or deleted. Thus, by its cellular composition, and through the compartmentalization of its afferent and efferent limbs, the MALT functions essentially independently of the systemic immune apparatus.",

Since specific humoral immune defense is provided by both serum and hy secretory antibodies, predominately of the IgA isotype, tbat are selectively transported into external secretions, most vaccines considered for further improvement or development should ideally induce both systemic and mucosal responses.",

Naive (pTh) cells first produce interleukin (IL)-2) and then develop into T cells producing multiple cytokines (including both IFN-7and IL-4), a stage often termed ThO (45, 46) . The tissue microenvironment (47) , the cytokine milieu and the nature of the antigen influence the further differentiation of ThO ce!!s. Thus, infection with intracellular bacteria !eads to t!ie formation of Th 1 ce!!s and these ce!!s often deve!op fo!!owing production of IL-12 by activated macrophages (48, 49) , Exogenous antigens in the mucosa! microenvironment can trigger CD4+, NK1,1 + T cells to produce IL-4 for initiation of Th2-type responses (from ThO cells) (50, 51) . Th2-type cells also produce IL-4 for expansion of the Th2 subset as well as IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-1 3 (5 2-5 6). This Th2 array may include production of IL-4; however, the reader should appreciate that individual cytokines are regulated through different signal transduction pathways so tbat all Thl or Th2 cells do not produce the entire array. The Th2 array of cytokines is of importance for B-cell isotype switches, and for supporting IgGl, IgG2b, IgE, and IgA responses in the mouse system (54, 57, 58) .",

In addition to the detection of specific S-IgA antibodies in remote secretions induced by natural exposure to antigens or orai immunization, anaiyses of IgA-secrecing ceiis from peripheral biood and mucosai tissues after enteric immunization provided strong support for this concept system, this finding may explain both the unification of humoral immune responses in diverse mucosal sites and the physiologic segregation of mucosal from non-mucosal immune mechanisms. Based on the concept of a common mucosal immune system through which a fraction of lymphocytes activated in the gut. e.g. hy iugestion of antigen, can disseminate immunity not only in the intestine hut also to other mucosal and glandular tissues, there is currently inuch interest in the possibility of developing oral vaccines against both enteric and non-enteric tnucosal infections, e.g. in the respiratory or genital tract. However, recent studies involving immunizations of human and non-human primates as well as rodents with prototype nonreplicating immunogens, such as cholera toxoids or cholera toxin indicate that a substantial degree of subcompartmentalization exists within the mucosal immune system, and even within a given mucosal organ such as the gut, regarding both homing of IgA plasma cell precursors and final redistrihution of their progenitors.",

The same construct was employed to demonstrate that plasmid DNA vaccination of infant chimpanzees was well tolerated and could induce serum antibodies to HIV-1 (197), As for conventional vaccines, several formulations have been developed to faciiitate the uptake of plasmid DNA-based vacciues and to protect chem from degradation in the mucosal microenvironment. The use of liposomes, cationic lipids, monophosphoryl lipid A for mucosa! delivery of DNA (198) (199) (200) (201) has been shown to increase both expression and immunogeuicity ofthe corresponding protein, suggesting thac the lipid matrix may also provide a secondary role as adjuvanc by facilitating DNA uptake by APCs or by promoting local inflammation. Iu che case of oral delivery, plasmid DNA can also be protected from degradation in che guc by encapsulacion Immunological Reviews 170/1999 in poiy(DL-iactide-co-glycohde) (PGL) microparticles (202, 203) , Attenuated intraceliular bacteria sucb as Salmoneiia, wbicb are retained within vacuoies in tbe infected ceii. iiave recentiy shown promise for tile dehvery of plasmid DNA. Thus, infection of peritoneal macrophages with S. lyphi carrying a plasmid encoding lac Z resuits in the transfer of piasmid DNA into tbe infected ceii (204) . Very recentiy, this approach has been employed to demonstrate tbat orai administration of S. typhi carrying a tumor antigen resuits in gene transfer in host DCs and protects mice against fibrosarcoma (205) .",

Since plants can be engineered to contain muhiple foreign genes, multicomponent transgenic plant vaccines should therefore be feasible. Severai piant expression systems, e.g. potato and tobacco plants, have been developed and sbown to aiiow expression of microbiai antigens such as hepatitis B surface antigen, E. coli LT-B, and even Norwalk Virus-like particles (VLPs) (reviewed in (211)).

Because toierance can be transferred by both serum and cells from tolerized animais, it is possible tbat bumorai antibodies (IgA?), circulating undegraded antigens or toierogenic fragments and cytokines may act synergistically to confer T-celi unresponsiveness. Without exciudiiig the above possibiiities, another mechanism that may be considered could involve antigen-driven attraction of infiammatory T ceiis from the periphery into the mucosai microenvironment where they could be rendered anergic, functionaiiy skewed, deieted or even ignored.

The roie of absorptive epitbeiiai ceiis, such as intestinai enterocytes, in toierance induction has been underscored by severai studies (reviewed in (241, 242) ). Epitheiiai enterocytes express co-stimuiatory moiecuies such as non-ciassicai MHC ciass 1 (CD i d) moiecuies involved in antigen presentation to subpopulations of T celis and abnormai forms or ieveis of MHC ciass II molecules, ieading to seiective triggering of suppressive CD8+ T cells and/or abortive presentation to CD4' T celis.

Aithough activated B ceiis and tissue macrophages are powerful APCs for memory Tb ceiis, evidence suggests tbat antigen presentation by resting B ceiis results in T-celi tolerance (243, 244) . It shouid bowever be noted that B ceiis activated in vitro with bacteriai iipopoiysaccharide (LPS). a prominent component of the normal mucosal microflora, are capable of inducing toierance wiien injected into naive hosts (244) . Aithougb functional DCs have been identified in mucosal tissues sucb as tbe Peyer's patches, tbe mesenteric lymph, the intestinal iamina propria and the airw-ay mucosa (reviewed in (245)), tiieir roie in activating rather than suppressing naive T cells has received strongest support. Thus, DCs freshly isolated from the airway mucosa preferentially activate Tb2 ceiis but can also mature into APGs capabie of activating Till (246) . Thus, airway DG cells could play a pivotai role in the cross-regulation of Thl-and Tli2-driven responses. However, recent experiments with splenic dendritic ceils have siiown a differentiai capacity of these DC subpopuiations to activate T ceiis, suggesting the existence of regulatory and immunostimulatory DC subsets, supporting the emergence of the concept of toierogenic DCs (247) . Further, treatment with F]t3 ligand which is known to expand DCs in vivo, bas been reported to enhance oral tolerance (248) . Interestingly, LPS, whicb is known to cause the rapid exit of DCs, has also been shown to eniiance tolerance induction (249) .

Regulatory T ceils in the mucosal immune system T cells are required for mucosal immunity, whether it develops as inflammation, or as tolerance or as help for specific S-IgA antibodies or CTLs in response to vaccines. B-cell commitment ((j->a switching) and B-T interactions which result in the induction of plasma cells producing polymeric IgA (pIgA) are of central importance to mucosal immunity Cytokines and chemokines produced by CD4*' and CD8\"^ T-celJ subsets and by classical APCs (e.g. dendritic cells (DCs, macrophages and B cells)) as well as by non-dassical APCs (e.g, epithelial ceUs) contribute to a!! aspects of norma! mucosa! immunity, tolerance and inflammation in the immune response.

Strategically positioned at the entry of the aerodigestive tract, the palatine, lingual and nasopharyngeal tonsils (Waldeyer's ring) are continuously exposed to ingested and inhaled antigens. These glands possess structural features resemhling hoth lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (87), including a lymphoepithelium which contains M cells in tonsillar crypts, and which are essential for antigen uptake (Fig. 2). In addition, germinal centers containing B and T cells, plasma cells, and professional APCs are also present. Several observations have suggested that these lymphoid tissues may serve as a source of precursors of IgA plasma cells found in the upper aerodigestive tracts: the distribution of IgA 1-andIgA2-producing cells in the nasal and gastric mucosae and in lacrymal and salivary glands is similar to that found in tonsils. Furthermore, the S-IgA immune response to oral poliovirus vaccine is reduced in toiisillectomized children compared to children with intact tonsils (114). Direct unilateral injection of antigens into the tonsil of human volunteers resulted in the induction of local immune responses manifested by the appearance of antigen-specific igG-produciug and to a lesser degree IgA-producing cells in the injected tonsil (103). Furthermore, considerable numbers of antibody-forming cells with a similar distribution of isotypes were detected in peripheral blood, suggesting that the tonsils may serve as an inductive site, analogous to Peyer's patches, that is effective in the stimulation of generalized mucosal immune responses. Inductive sites in the genital tract mucosa Although long considered as immunologically incapable of supporting an active immune response against locally encountered antigens, but especially against spermatozoa or preimplantation embryo, the female reproductive tract mucosa has heeu shown to comprise all cell populations required for initiating an immune response. FILA-DR+ Langerhans cells have heen identified in the vaginal and cervical epithelia (117, 118), heing most abundant in the vulval epithelium. Intraepithelial T cells have heen identified at all sites and comprise a majority of CD8\"^ cells, the latter heing particularly ahundant in and cervix stains for secretory component and has thus the potential to transport polymeric IgA (120, 121). Vaginal immunization of htiman and non-human primates with cholera toxoid and CT, respectively, has heen shown to evoke serum antihody responses and secretory IgA and IgG responses in cervico-vaginal washes (100, 122, 1 23). Further, in female macaques immunized with CT applied into the vagina, these responses were associated with large numbers of IgG and IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) in the cervical and vaginal mucosae (100), demonstrating active production of such antihodies at local sites. Fiowever, this route of immunization was poorly if at all effective in inducing an IgA immune responses in other mucosal compartments (100). Although all components of the mucosal immune system are present in the female reproductive tract, the precise sites of induction of secretory immune responses in this organ are largely unknown. The most likely scenario involves antigen uptake by intraepithehal Langerhans cells which then migrate to draining lymphoid tissues where they actively educate naive T and B cells. These in turn migrate via the efferent lymph and the hlood circulation and seed to the suhmucosa where they differentiate into effector cells. Draining iliac lymph nodes appear to be the most likely site of initiation of such responses (92),",

Most studies co date Iiave been performed with r-Ad from which the El and E3 genes have been de!eted, rendering virus rep!ication deficient. A major advantage of the current generation of r-Ad vectors is t!ieir capacity to accommodate !arge amounts of exogenous cDNA(7-8 !ii!obases), a feature which !ias been used to express viru!ence genes from a number of viral pat!iogens. However, the virions retain ful! competence for infection of mucosa! epit!ie!ia! ce!ls in the respiratory tract (159, 160). In recent studies, r-Ad expressing Iierpes simplex virus g!ycoprotein B was shown to be a most effective vaccine when given by the intranasal route to mice (104, 105, 161). This regimen induced serum IgG as we!! as pu!monary IgA anti-glycoprotein B responses whicli corre!aced with protection from cha!!enge. Further, this vaccine induced an effective CTL response(162). The same authors have also demonstrated that this vector induced specific secretory immune responses in the rodent female genita! tract (104). This mucosa! route of immunization a!so appears to be safe and effective, since intranasal, iiitratrachea! and ora! de!ivery of SIVenv g!ycoprotein by an r-Ad to macaques(163)and intranasal immunization of chimpanzees with a r-Ad expressing HIV envelope and jjag genes (102) resulted in significant serum antibody responses. These antibody responses were broad-based, and when boosted with a gp 160 subunit vaccine, elicited serum neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant Ad have also been used as vector for rabies virus in order to orally vaccinate foxes (164). In addition, ora! adtninistration of r-Ad expressing RSV and hepatitis B virus sequences have successfully induced circulating antibody responses in dogs and chimpanzees (165, 166). Moreover, intranasal or enteric immunization with a r-Ad expressing bovine coronavirus hemagg!utininestrase glycoprotein induced virus specific mucosal immune responses in cotton rats (167). Despite these significant advances, further studies wi!! obviously be required to determine optima! mucosa! immunization protoco!s and to enhance the expression of desired antigens w!u!e documenting their mucosa! immunogenicity are sti!! !imited. This is somewhat surprising given tlie effectiveness in wild animals of an oral vaccine against rabies (169) based on a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the rabies glycoprotein gene (170). Oral administration of recombinant vaccinia virus encoding influenza virus hemagg!utinin and neuraminidase induced both systemic and secretory anti-inf!uenza antibody responses in mice (171, 172). Although relatively straightforward to generate in high yie!ds and to purify, rep!ication-competent recombinant vaccinia virtises pose potentia! problems for being used as mucosal vectors, inc!uding the ris!i of widespread infection in immunocompromised individua!s. Vector systems based on avian poxviruses (fow!pox or canarypox-ALVAC) or an attenuated vaccinia virus (NYVAC),have now been deve!oped which a!!ow on!y single round infections in mammalian ceUs(173), Intranasa! immunization of ferrets with NYVAC and ALVAC vectors expressing canine distemper virus HA and F genes were equa!!y potent in protecting these anima!s against CDV cha!!enge; intraduodena! administration was only part!y effective(174). Para!!e! evaluation of different vector systems is rarely found in the htterature. In one study, the efficacy of r-Ad and NYVAC vectors expressing pseudorabies gD glycoprotein was compared after intranasa! and intramuscu!ar immunization.

Based on tbis finding and on the resuits of other experiments with a variety of antigens (255), there is good reason to beiieve that such a system may be advantageous for inducing peripherai toierance.
