Malabsorptive procedures achieve a better weight reduction, compared to restrictive procedures like gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, Intensive care is well known about its high expenditure. It is largely attributed to the need for highly trained staff, expensive equipment and intensive use of diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and interventions. It is estimated that intensive care costs represent up to 20% of all hospital costs. The high intensive care expenditure has come into focus in recent years, since increasing health care cost could not match the Gross Domestic Product increase in many countries (Table 1) . It is therefore very important to incorporate cost-effectiveness into everyday practice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 898, "end": 907, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Major part of the intensive care cost is fixed, e.g. it is unrelated to the casemix ( Table 2) . It accounts for about 60-70% and is largely due to personnel cost. The variable cost includes drugs, nutrition, infusions including bloods and blood products, consumables, imaging and laboratory tests. Wide variability has been shown between diagnostic groups, the highest cost being multiple trauma, unscheduled major abdominal surgery, acute lung injury and the lowest being post coronary bypass surgery and ischaemic stroke. Interestingly, there is evidence that ICU physicians generate different variable costs mainly due to differences in practice. Length of stay is tightly associated with costs, and a large proportion of this variation is explained by differences in basic practice patterns. The high daily cost of intensive care therefore opens a new strategy of reducing length of ICU stay. How can it be done? Standardization of care practice through protocols and care pathways has been shown to be cost effective. Interventions which have shown to be cost-effective by reduction of length of stay include prevention of nosocomial infection and protocol-driven mechanical ventilation and weaning. Catheter-related nosocomial infection can be prevented by using full asepsis, realtime ultrasound and antibiotic impregnated catheters for central venous cannulation. Regarding ventilation, daily sedation hold can reduce ventilation time by 2 days and length of ICU stay by >3 days. These measures form an integral part of quality care. Reduction in ICU length of stay, however, does not mean direct cost saving; it means per ICU case saving only. Reducing the cost of intensive care is very limited: the frequency of laboratory and radiology tests, the use of generic versus name-brand drugs and the specific indications for transfusion are some opportunities for physicians. Cost control is becoming not just the task of the health policy expert or the hospital administrator -it is also task of the individual ICU clinician. Introduction. The diagnosis of early onset neonatal infection remains one of the greatest challenges in perinatal medicine. At birth the diagnosis must be based on the history of pregnancy and take into account a number of risk factors, such as preterm premature rupture of membranes with, usually, late recogniced subclinical intrauterine infection. Early onset neonatal infection is associated with an ascending infection from the cervix and the intact membranes during pregnancy act as an effective barrier against infection of the amniotic fluid [1] . Intrauterine infection at any time during pregnancy is an important risk factor for neonatal sepsis and is a frequent cause of mortality and morbidity in the newborn infants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2584, "end": 2587, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 86, "end": 94, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "If promptly started, antibiotic therapy can reduce its sequelae and improve the prognosis.

All supportive procedures are in the function of maintenance of impaired organ function, and they mostly aid in overcoming acute disorders in critically ill. The most important condition for a favorable outcome is control of the underlying disease, mainly sepsis [1] . Multiple organ failure (MOF) is a clinical syndrome even more common, than isolated ARF observed in ICU patients and burdened with a high mortality rate. It is well known that a higher number of failing organs results in an increased death rate. As pointed out in the introduction, evaluation of the role of a supportive procedure is hindered by the fact that the principal indicator of the outcome is the underlying disease itself. Since sepsis is the also most frequent cause of multiple organ failure in surgical as well as medical intensive care, only control over sepsis allows evaluation of the procedure of extracorporeal circulation. Which supportive therapy in the patients with ARF should be chosen is the question. In current literature there is no prospective randomized study, which documented better patient survival on continuous in relation to intermittent procedures. The majority of intensivists advocate this technique of renal function replacement due to generally accepted opinion that it has less effect on circulation of already hemodynamically unstable patients. In oral communications it is not infrequent to hear that this procedure is \"probably better\". It is indisputable that intermittent haemodialysis can affect hyperkalemia and volume excess faster, and it solves more rapidly the acute threat of electrolyte and water disturbances. Weekly dose of hemodialysis in chronic renal failure is defined, mainly by the quotient Kt / V > 1.2. The required dose of extracorporeal elimination in acute renal failure is not defined well enough, however it does not essentially differ from the said quotient. It has been well established that cytokines affect the severity of the septic process. According to some recent publications CRRT might play a significant role in the elimination of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in addition to clearing nitrogen products as well as other medium and large sized molecules. The possible removal of pro-inflammatory mediators may permit a blockade of systemic inflammation, a modulation of the altered immune response in these patients, and it may lead to a partial or total restoration of the lost homeostasis [2, 3] . On the other side according meta analysis in published and unpublished trials in any language CRRT in comparison to IHD does not improve survival or renal recovery in unselected critically ill patients with ARF. On the other hand, continuous procedure of hemofiltration has less effect on the stability of circulation. In our prospective randomized study with 104 patients, we also did not observed any difference in 28 days survival, in total survival, as well as in circulatory instability between two treatment modalities. The number of hypotensive attacks defined by blood pressure fall over 10 mmHg in our group of patients on continuous procedures was not significantly smaller [4] . However, there is a randomized prospective study which showed better survival with high volume hemofiltration 35 ml/kg/h compared to low volume ultra filtration in which 25 l of volume are replaced in 24 hours [5] . When choosing the method of extracorporeal circulation, despite the fact that prospective randomized studies did not prove better survival using one of them, intensivists are advised to use the method with fewer side effects and of greater benefit in a given case. Our prospective randomized study did not show a statistically significant difference between the two methods of renal replacement therapy. Survival rates were not affected and neither was the occurrence of hemodynamic instability. We therefore believe that the management of the underlying condition outweighs the choice of the procedure of renal replacement. Currently, the use of these methods in the world varies. Almost all intensive care units in England utilize continuous methods. In USA intermittent procedures are used more commonly than continuous ones, which is similar to the situation presently found in Croatia. We believe that both methods are complementary; IHD for faster elimination of electrolytes and waste products elimination, CRRT for regulation of higher calories requirements and for hemodinamically unstable patients.

All supportive procedures are in the function of maintenance of impaired organ function, and they mostly aid in overcoming acute disorders in critically ill. The most important condition for a favorable outcome is control of the underlying disease, mainly sepsis [1] . In the light of this knowledge the place of intermittent hemodialysis procedures should be viewed, compared to continuous hemofiltration procedures and their effect on the survival of critically ill. Multiple organ failure is a clinical syndrome burdened with a high mortality rate. It is well known that a higher number of failing organs results in an increased death rate. One organ failure results in the death rate of 25-30%, two organs 50-60%, three organs 80% or more, and four organs 100%. As pointed out in the introduction, evaluation of the role of a supportive procedure is hindered by the fact that the principal indicator of the outcome is the underlying disease itself. In current literature there is no prospective randomized study, which showed better patient survival on continuous in relation to intermittent procedures. In order to answer the question what is the procedure of choice in critically ill patients, one must eliminate certain forms of intermittent hemodialysis which by themselves carry frequent problems during extracorporeal circulation. Since the machines with controlled ultrafiltration and bicarbonate dialysate imply smaller incidence of complications, only these devices can be considered comparable with continuous hemofiltration. Meta-analysis of a number of studies, which compared biocompatible to bioincompatible membranes gave advantage to biocompatible membrane, we used machines with controlled ultrafiltration, bicarbonate dialysate solution, and biocompatible polysulfone membrane in our study. It is indisputable that hemodialysis can affect hyperkalemia and volume excess faster, and it solves more rapidly the acute threat of electrolyte and water derrangements. Weekly dose of hemodialysis in chronic renal failure is defined, mainly by the quotient Kt / V > 1.2. The required dose of extracorporeal elimination in acute renal failure is not defined well enough, however it does not essentially differ from the said quotient. The length of intermittent procedure is also not well defined. It mostly lasts 3-4 hours, but some used prolonged intermittent dialysis lasting 9 hours and did not obtain different survival compared to continuous procedures. It has been well established that cytokines affect the severity of the septic process. The possible removal of proinflamatory mediators may permit a blocade of systemic inflammation, a modulation of the altered immune response in these patients, and it may lead to a partial or total restoration of the lost homeostasis). A statistically significant reduction in heart rate, increase in systemic vascular resistance an systolic blood pressure were documented in the group of patients who underwent CRRT. On the other side according meta analysis in published and unpublished trials in any language CRRT in comparison to IHD does not improve survival or renal recovery in unselected critically ill patients with ARF. On the other hand, continuous procedure of hemofiltration has less effect on the stability of circulation. Comparison of value of intermittent hemodialysis with continuous procedures of hemofiltration should therefore be considered in the light of the mentioned fact. In our pro- spective randomised study with 104 patients, we also did not observed any difference in 28 days survival, in total survival, as well as in circulatory instabilitiy between two treatment modalities. Even in subgroup of 80 patients with sepsis and septic shock there were no difference in survival. Sepsis was the underlying disorder in 52 and septic shock in 28 patients out of 104 patients analyzed in this study.

Severe SIRS and Sepsis Shock remain clinical syndromes with high morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular failure seems to play a key role in the subsequent development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and in one of our studies involving 3700 intensive care unit patients cardiovascular failure was besides CNS-failure the second most important independed predictor of ICU-mortality [1] . Rivers et al. recently published their data on the development of inflammatory response and activation of apoptosis in patients included in their \"early goal directed therapy study\" [2] . The most interesting finding was that the severity of tissue hypoperfusion as assessed by arterial lactate values and central venous oxygen saturation at admission was by far the most important determinant of the magnitude of subsequent inflammation and apoptosis developing during the resuscitation process. Quite similar, Howell et al. recently showed that occult hypoperfusion is a main determinant of mortality in pa-tients with suspected infection [3] . However, hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock is not always an easy task to do. Severe hypotension often poorly responds to volume therapy. In addition the administration of catecholamines may be accompanied by undesirable side-effects which may be harmful and even worsen the prognosis of patients. Catecholamine toxicity occurring during cardiovascular resuscitation seems to be a growing problem in elderly patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases treated in our intensive care units.

Figure 1 illustrates the principle hemodynamic problem associated with septic shock. Our cardiovascular system is programmed to keep a predefined perfusion pressure relatively constant during normal life. This is accomplished by modulating vascular conductivity (= reciprocal value of vascular resistance) and cardiac output. Every increase in vascular conductivity, e.g. during dynamic exercise, must be met by an appropriate increase in cardiac output to keep mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) relatively constant. In severe SIRS and Sepsis vascular conductivity progressively increases due to liberation of a large quantity of vasodilatory mediators, in particular nitric oxide. To keep MAP constant, cardiac output has to increase.

Stress associated with critical illness and exogenous catecholamine delivery may disproportional increase heart rate compromising left ventricular blood flow. This situation may be catastrophic in particular in patients with pre-existing limited coronary reserve.

However when we proceed along the steep part of the patients cardiac function curve we finally end up at the upper flat part of the Frank Starling relationship. At that point cardiac output will no more respond to volume loading and at a certain vascular conductivity there will be no more increase in MAP. In contrast, at that stage further volume loading will only augment tissue oedema formation and unnecessarily increase end diastolic left ventricular filling pressure thereby decreasing left coronary perfusion pressure in particular to subendocardial regions of the left ventricle. Figure 3 demonstrates the cardiovascular situation of the patient after volume resuscitation and also points at the different possibilities to further correct hypotension. At the given vascular conductivity, volume loading alone results in an increase in cardiac output of 1,5 l/min thereby increasing MAP by 12 mmHg. The patient is still hypotensive and in this situation MAP can only be increased to \"normal\" values by either augmenting systemic blood flow using positive inotropic agents or by decreasing vascular conductivity with vasopressor agents or finally by a combination of both.

In clinical praxis, this toxicity very often manifests as new onset tachyarrhmias, signs of myocardial ischemia and the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. Experimental data clearly demonstrate that, at least in the heart myocardial toxicity of sympathomimetic drugs is mediated through b1-adrenergic receptors. At the cellular level, induction of inflammation and cell death by apoptosis and necrosis has been demonstrated. b1-adrenoreceptor blockade significantly blunts catecholamine induced myocardial toxicity [13] . Unfortunately, when giving high doses of sympathomimetic drugs clinicians are frequently faced with the problem of decreasing drug response but without blunted side-effects. In one study in patients with systemic inflammation and advanced MODS we observed a striking rise in mortality when norepinephrine was raised to dosages in excess of 0.6 \u00b5g/kg/ min. In a recent investigation, Kumar et al. reported higher baseline heart rate and weakened cardiac output response to a stepwise increasing infusion of dobutamine in patients dying from severe sepsis and septic shock when compared to survivors [15] .

I was involved in investigations of patients under anesthesia and with muscle relaxants.

In one position of the stopcock the flow went into the container and -depending on the pressure which was regulated by a mechanical resistor -the spirometer went down and thus inflat- ing the lungs of the patient with pure oxygen.

The burning question was: is there a real increase in functional residual capacity after applying an intra-alveolar pressure of 40-50 cm water, or is it just some plastic behaviour of the lung due to the properties of the alveolar surfactant system.

Especially in surfactant impaired lungs the FRC was always increased after pressure-volume recordings. My interpretation of the results 35 years ago was related more to lung recruitment than to the behaviour of the pulmonary surfactant system. At that time we did not correlate the FRC measurements with arterial blood gas measurements. Now let's move to the year 1976. I was still living in east Berlin but I got a 1-year grant from the World Health Organisation to work in Sweden. I decided to go for surfactant research to Bengt Robertson in Stockholm who had visited me a few times before in my lab in Berlin -and to Bjorn Jonson's lab in Lund.

Then I started to discuss with Bjorn if it would also be possible to use the Servo-Ventilator 900B as pressure-regulated time-cycled ventilator -a mode which we used for our patients during broncho spirometry and for all of our animal experiments in Berlin. A lot of discussion took place because he was so proud on his invention of the flow regulator and now someone was asking for some ventilator modes which did not require his newly invented flow regulator! Finally, by putting the working pressure at the required pressure level and putting the minute volume almost to infinite and adding electronically the pause time to the inspiratory time, we created the perfect pressure-controlled time-cycled ventilator with all monitoring functions! We then did the same that we did with volume-controlled ventilation, now again in random order, changing respiratory rates, pause time, I/E ratios etc. both in volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation. This time, at each ventilator setting we also took blood samples and found that, in the surfactant-deficient rabbits at pressure-controlled mode with a very long inspiratory time, the arterial oxygen tension was always significantly higher in comparison to constant flow ventilation with a short inspiratory time.

All the latter lungs showed widespread atelectasis, hyaline membranes, necrosis, and desquamation of airway epithelium -whereas lungs ventilated with lower pressures showed only some minor morphological changes which may have been introduced by surfactant depletion.

The systemic inflammatory reaction in the course of sepsis causes an activation of the coagulation system which can range from a subtle alteration of certain sensitive laboratory parameters to an overt DIC, consisting of an uncontrolled consumption of coagulation factors with microthrombosis and subsequent bleeding. This sometimes catastrophic event is initiated by the expression of tissue factor (TF) on several cell types triggered by cytokines and mediators of inflammation. Following the activation of factor VII and subsequently factor X, prothrombin is finally transformed into thrombin, the key actor of coagulation. Beside its procoagulatory effects, exerted through the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and the activation of platelets, thrombin exhibits also anticoagulatory characteristics by activating the protein C pathway. Protein C is a physiological serineprotease. The inactive form of protein C is activated by endothelium-bound thrombomodulin, which is activated by thrombin itself. In concert with its co-factor protein S and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), activated protein C (aPC) inhibits the physiological coagulation by proteolytically degrading coagulation co-factors Va and VIIIa, thereby inhibiting the de novo formation of thrombin.

Additionally, activation of the inactive form of protein C can be impaired by a downregulation of the expression of thrombomodulin and of the EPCR on the endothelium due to circulating cytokines.

Plasmin hydrolyses fibrin to d-dimers, thereby controlling excess coagulation and avoiding intravascular clotting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "However, analogous to coagulation, fibrinolysis is also controlled by inhibitors of the plasminogen activators. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is synthesized in the endothelium and inactivates t-PA and u-PA by forming complexes with both of them.

Activated protein C participates in several ways in this complex interaction of activators and inhibitors of fibrin synthesis and degradation. The activation of TAFI is directly impeded by the inhibition of thrombin formation. Additionally, aPC can inactivate PAI-1 by binding it in complexes, thereby increasing indirectly the fibrinolytic activity of t-PA. Taking these effects into account it becomes clear, that the sepsis induced reduction of activated protein C plasma level causes not only an increase in thrombin formation, but also a decrease of fibrinolysis, further supporting the imbalance of the coagulation system in sepsis. However, the clinical impact of these effects remains difficult to judge. In the PROWESS study, the application of recombinant activated protein C resulted in a decrease of d-dimers [2] , possibly as a result of an indirect inhibition of fibrinolysis by the reduction of thrombin formation.

Introduction. Acute ischemic stroke accounts for ~ 80% of all strokes and is a major cause of disability and other adverse long-term sequel [1] . For patients seen within 3 hours after stroke onset, intravenous thrombolysis (iv) with recombinant tissuetype plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved treatment option [2, 3] . Yet the vast majority (>95%) of patients with acute ischemic stroke do not receive such treatment. No other therapy for acute ischemic stroke is of proven clinical utility in enhancing long-term outcomes [4] . The main focus of recent ischemic stroke endeavours has been to try and realise the benefits apparent in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS) and Stroke rtPA trial [5] in a broader stroke care setting. This requires professional awareness of the precise requirements of emergency stroke management. In the NINDS trial, carefully selected patients without CT evidence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) who received rtPA thrombolysis were \u2265 30% more likely to be free of (or have minimal) disability at 3 months compared with placebo controls. Aside from protocol deviations, including the difficulty in treating most patients within 3 hours after stroke onset, hemorrhagic complications and the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes by thrombus dimensions and anatomic distributions are outstanding issues with thrombolysis. For instance, clot lysis/recanalisation with thrombolysis may be less effective for large internal carotid artery thrombi compared with associated proximal middle cerebral artery thrombi. The rate of symptomatic ICH \u2264 36 hours after stroke onset in NINDS was an order of magnitude (~ 10 times) higher in rtPA patients (6.4%) than in placebo controls (0.6%; P < .001), although 3-month mortality rates were similar in these two treatment arms (17% vs 21%, respectively; p = 0.30) [5] . Symptomatic ICH occurred in 8.8% of those randomized to intravenous thrombolysis compared with 3.4% of controls in the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS-II) involving 800 patients without major (multilobar) infarcts according to screening CT who received treatment (or placebo) within 6 hours after stroke onset [6] . Certain subgroups may be less likely to experience favourable long-term outcomes with rtPA iv therapy, including patients with more severe strokes (higher baseline National Institute for Health -Stroke Scale (NIH -SS) scores), diabetes, and/or advanced age. Studies involving fybrinolytic regimens apart from i.v. rtPA have shown no benefit (unfavourable effects) and are thus not approved. The interpretation of the some latest studies may also lead to more widespread implementation of thrombolysis, however, careful documentation and evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of such a policy is of paramount importance [7] . One of such registers is an academic-driven, non-profit, international register, initiated by the medical profession (Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke International Stroke Thrombolysis Register -SITS-ISTR) as an internet-based interactive thrombolysis register, to serve as an instrument for clinical centres to follow their own treatment results and compare with other centres in their countries.

They may involve factors of the acute illness or be iatrogenic; these factors represent areas of risk that are potentially modifiable by preventive or therapeutic intervention. Host factors: age (older), alcoholism, APOE4 polymorphism, cognitive impairment, depression, hypertension, smoking, vision/hearing impairment. Factors of critical illness: acidosis, anemia, fever/infection/ sepsis, hypotension, metabolic disturbances, respiratory disease, high severity of illness.

In the ageing process KYNA metabolism in the brain and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats and also of sheep shows a characteristic pattern of changes throughout the life span. A marked increase of the KYNA content in the CNS occurs before the birth, accompanied by a dramatic decline on the day of birth [4, 5] and significant increase during maturation and aging [6, 7] . Increase of L-kynurenine, a substrate for KYNA synthesis, with age has been also shown [8] . In human CSF significant increase of KYNA levels with age progression has been found, too [9] . This remarkable profile of KYNA metabolism alterations in mammalian brain has been suggested to result from the development of the organisation of neuronal connections and synaptic plasticity, development of receptor recognition sites, maturation and ageing [1, 7, 10] .

In humans, synthetic small diameter vascular grafts do not spontaneously endothelialize even after long-term implantation. This lack of an endothelium makes prosthetic grafts more prone to thrombotic occlusions than vein grafts [1] . In vitro lining of synthtic grafts with cultured autologous endothelial cells overcomes this physiological deficiency by creating a confluent monolayer of autologous intima cells prior to implantation. In a step-by-step approach we developed reliable mass culture techniques for autologous endothelial cells [1] as well as precoating [2] and lining techniques which resulted in shear stress resistance of the endothelium [3] .

The selection criterion was the unavailability of a suitable saphenous vein graft. Indications for surgery were disabling claudication in 37 patients (grade I chronic limb ischemia) and chronic limb ischemia in 12 patients (grade II in 6 patients and grade III in 6 patients). In patients assigned to the endothelialized group the right external jugular vein was excised under local anaesthesia, using a no-touch dissection and in-situ cannulation [1] . Endothelial cells were cultured in medium containing 20% autologous serum. The mass culture of first passage endothelial cells in two 165 cm 2 culture flasks was continued until the required cell number of 16 x 10 6 endothelial cells was confirmed by in-situ counting [1] . After reinforced 6mm ePTFE grafts (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) were precoated with clinically approved, fibrinolytically inhibited fibrin glue (Immuno, Vienna, Austria). Seeding of endothelial cells onto the graft surface (8.1 \u00b1 4.2 x 10 5 EC/ml cell suspension) was performed in an automated, temperature and pH controlled rotation device (Microplan, Vienna, Austria).

Immediately after the seeding procedure and shortly before implantation, graft specimens were taken for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy. During implantation grafts were not clamped and the culture medium was kept inside the prosthesis by gravity adjustment of the operating table. After nine patients were excluded from the study due to growth failure of the autologous endothelial cells, twenty-four patients received twenty-seven successfully endothelialized grafts (three had a bilateral procedure) and sixteen patients received a unilateral untreated control prosthesis. In both groups three grafts were implanted below the knee. Follow up studies were performed after 9 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and on an annual basis thereafter.

Treatment of an open abdomen following secondary peritonitis is a challenge for surgery and intensive care units (ICU). The goal of this study was to compare three different treatment strategies for the open abdomen: V.A.C. Abdominal Dressing (AD), conventional V.A.C. therapy (CV) and conventional open therapy (OP). Methods. All patients suffering from an open abdomen following surgery for secondary peritonitis between 2001 and 2006 at 5 different surgical departments in Austria were retrospectively analyzed. Parameters that were analyzed: duration of open abdomen, incidence of multi-organ failure, need for surgical revisions, length of stay (LOS) in ICU, nursing requirements (change of dressing/day), survival and integrity of abdominal wall after discharge. Treatment strategies included: open packing (OP), classic vacuum assisted closure (VAC \u00ae )therapy with silicone net protection for the intestines (CV) and VAC \u00ae therapy with \"Abdominal Dressing\" a newly developed dressing containing an encapsulated foam with non-adherent layer (AD).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF30": {"text": "-DPAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and oesophageal pressure (Pes) were recorded continuously together with distal airway pressure measured by catheter introduced above carina.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF31": {"text": "Grant Acknowledgement.

Teleconsultation is defined as consultation, evaluation and management services provided to patients via telecommunication systems without personal face-to-face interaction between the patient and healthcare provider. The increasing clinical relevance of computer assisted navigation technology promoted new perspectives in telemedicine utilizing live sensor data to enhance remote visualisation [1] [2] . Any \"digital\" content, i.e. digital images from imaging modalities (most frequently computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) as well as navigation data (e.g. intraoperative coordinates of surgical instruments relatively to preplanned pathways and target-points at the patient, implant positions etc.), can be transferred without any loss of information. This means that remote experts can be involved in surgical interventions or preoperative planning sessions while being supplied with identical information as the \"local\" staff.The augmented reality principle. Our approach is based on \"augmented reality\". In contrast to \"virtual reality\", which stands for completely computer generated information content (as known from computer games or flight simulators), \"augmented reality\" expands the \"real world\" (i.e. the actual view onto anatomical structures or the OR-site etc.) by means of the integration of additional computer generated information [3] . This computer generated information are usually com-puter graphics illustrating surgical pathways, implant positions or target structures inside the patient's tissue. They are superimposed with the surgeon's original view and therefore build a kind of \"augmented world\". Spatial awareness during image guided surgery [4] is only recently the focus of research but absolutely mandatory in teleconsultation. The visual display of data in context with the patient's anatomy as 3D computer graphic enables a more comprehensive judgment of the situation almost in real time [5] .Computer assisted dental implantology and telecommunication. So far for all the different concepts of guided dental implant positioning (e.g. common surgical drilling templates, intraoperative navigation, templates manufactured with rapid prototyping etc.), CT data are the base for preoperative treatment planning. This CT data set can easily be transmitted from the radiologist to an experienced implant planning centre, either on CD-ROMs via \"snail-mail\", or via Internet. In such a centre the experts use special software that allows for comprehensive evaluation of the anatomical situation in order to accomplish a planning that optimises the dental prosthetic restoration considering the available bone as well as all prosthetic, aesthetical and functional aspects. This is a complex process that requires a high level of experience and routine.A major difference to image guided navigation in other medical segments is that the prosthetic planning mandates the position of the implants. An intraoperative adaptation of the simulated implant position can only be successfully accomplished if the consequence for the suprastructure is visualized immediately. With CT data only the surgeon has insufficient visual clues about the correct placement of dental implants during surgery. Therefore we not only superimpose the planned implant position during surgery, but also the complete CAD/CAM designed suprastructure registered to the patient. This decision-making based on \"shape information\" instead of image guided navigation information alone helps the surgeon to maintain spatial awareness. We focus on tasks in dental implantology with exemplary spread between highly knowledge-based and skill-centred activities, because here research and development activities merging image guided navigation with teleconsultation have an immediate impact on patient treatment outcome. We show that 3D telenavigation can be utilized to transfer the design of bone-anchored epithesis for congenital ear malformations and consult intra-operatively an expert connected via Internet for second opinion.Case study microtia epithesis. A-21-year old university student with microtia came to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of OMS, Faculty of Medicine, Keio University, Japan hoping to make an ear-epithesis because he had to let his long hair cut for his examination of employment after the graduation of school. The patient had no chance to receive plastic and reconstructive surgery in his younger age due to asthma. Because maxillofacial implant placement surgery is necessary to make ear-epithesis, we planned navigation implant surgery, which is becoming the standard in intraoral dental implant surgery. So far the placement of osseointegrated implants in the temporal bone has been guided with CT images and anatomical knowledge in order to avoid intracranial perforation during surgery. This time, we used an implant navigation system (Virtual Implant System). In addition, we planned the surgery using Internet communication with Vienna. The initial implant position simulation was defined relative to the 3D reconstruction of the bone, based on the CT. Mirroring the data from the other intact ear generated the initial 3D data for the ear epithesis (Figs. 1, 2) . The insertion points for the implants were then modified according to the shape of the pinna. Finally, the synthetic pinna was produced by rapid prototyping. During surgery the surgeon had the patient's anatomy and the virtual pinna superimposed on the computer screen. After teleconsultation with the experts two implants (Ankylos \u00ae extraoral implant, Friadent, Germany) were placed in the temporal bone with image guide navigation [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 574, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 575, "end": 578, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1557, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1880, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2132, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5858, "end": 5861, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5410, "end": 5422, "text": "(Figs. 1, 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction."}, {"text": "Cx 43 PHMB-CVC were tested in an in-vivo model using implantation of catheters into the internal jugular veins of rabbits.
