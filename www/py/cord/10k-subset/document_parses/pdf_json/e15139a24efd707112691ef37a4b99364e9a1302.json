To estimate the effects of the Iowa Managed Substance Abuse Care Plan (IMSACP) on substance abuse service use by publicly funded patients, service use before and after IMSACP was compared; adjustments were made for changes in population sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Between fiscal years 1994 and 1997, patient case mix was marked by a higher burden of illness and the use of inpatient, residential nondetox, outpatient counseling, and assessment services declined, while use of intensive outpatient and residential detox services increased. Findings were similar among women, children, and homeless persons. Thus, care moved away from high-cost inpatient settings to less costly venues. Without knowing the impact on treatment outcomes, these changes cannot be interpreted as improved provider efficiency versus simply cost containment and profit maximization.",

An advantage of variable-length episodes is that they allow an examination of changes in the duration and intensity of treatment.

As an example of how they differ, suppose a patient received outpatient services during September, October, and November 1993 and again during January and February 1994.

The first episode would include only the services received from September through November, since there was a break in treatment between November and January. The services received during January and February would constitute a second episode.

Typically these measures have large numbers of zero values (ie, most patients do not receive any services within a given category), but among persons with non-zero values (the users of services), the conditional distribution of service use is highly skewed, with a few patients accounting for a disproportionate amount of total use. These features characterized the Iowa substance abuse service data as well, so a two-part model of the form E (Y) = pr (Y > 0) \u2022 E (Y I Y > 0) was used, where Y represented a particular service use measure (eg, number of inpatient days). The first part of the two-part model was estimated as a multiple logistic regression of the probability that the patient used any service within that category (eg, had any inpatient days). The second part of the two-part model was estimated as a linear regression of the level of use among the subset of patients who used the service (eg, the number of inpatient days among persons who were admitted to the hospital). Due to the skewed distributions of the conditional use measures, log transformations of the dependent variable were used. To retransform the parameter estimates to calculate effects on utilization measured on the original (not log) scale, the so-called \"smearing\" algorithm developed for the Health Insurance Experiment was used, with modifications to allow for heteroskedasticity. 21 '22 The formula for the predicted value of the outcome for person j was E (Yj) = [eXjS/(1 + eXj~)] \u2022 SeXj c~, where Xj is a vector of regressor values for person j,/3 is the vector of coefficient estimates from the logistic regression, a is the vector of coefficient estimates from the linear regression, and S is the smear factor, defined as the mean of the exponentiated residuals among the relevant subgroup (FY 1994 versus FY 1997 cohort).

For example, to calculate the \"predictive margins\" for overall (unconditional) use of services, the smear factor was first calculated based only on the observations from the FY 1997 cohort. The value of the cohort indicator (FY 1997 versus FY 1994) was set to equal 1 for all patients, holding all other regressors at their original values, and the predicted value of the outcome for each observation was calculated.

The reduction was due to both lower probabilities of use and conditional levels of use. In contrast, both the probability and conditional use of residential detox days increased over time. The probability of having inpatient detox days also was higher, so even though the average number of inpatient detox days among users was lower, the mean days among the entire sample was slightly higher in FY 1997 than in FY 1994. The opposite pattern was seen with methadone maintenance visits, although its use was extremely rare. The probability of receiving intensive outpatient services increased substantially. However, use of regular outpatient counseling was substantially reduced, in terms of both the probability of any use and the average number of counseling minutes received by users. This was due to reductions in both individual and group counseling. The average number of assessment minutes across the entire sample also was reduced, despite a small increase in the probability of receipt. Table 4 shows the results from the two-part regression models based on the fixed-length episodes. The second column gives the relative risks for the probability of any use of the service, that is, the mean predicted probability that an episode would include the given service if it were from FY 1997, divided by the mean predicted probability if the episode were from FY 1994 instead. The third column gives the percentage increase or decrease in the amount of the service used among the subsample of episodes that included any use of the service. The last column gives the level change in the expected amount of the service used among the entire sample. The results were very consistent with the unadjusted differences seen in Table 3 , except that after regression adjustment there were no longer significant differences in the probability of any methadone use, the expected number of residential detox days among users of residential detox, and the expected number of inpatient detox days or methadone maintenance visits among the entire sample. Table 5 shows the regression results from sensitivity analyses using the variable-length episodes. Months in treatment dropped by -0.36 months, which is approximately a 14% decline (the mean number of months in treatment for the FY 1994 cohort was 2.51, with a standard deviation of 2.45). However, this result should be viewed with caution, as the dates of service within each month could not be determined from the monthly service records, so the exact duration of treatment also could not be determined. The variable-length episode results for the relative risks of use and changes in conditional and unconditional use for services received during the entire episode looked very similar to those from the fixed-length episodes, except that the change in the conditional number of inpatient detox days lost significance. Additional results showed that the intensity of services (number of days, visits, or minutes per episode-month) followed the same patterns as service use during the entire episode.",

This combination makes them a prime target for service reductions to decrease costs.

The pattern that severity at admission may have increased concurrently with the introduction of managed care is at least consistent with the hypothesis that indigent Iowa residents experienced reduced access to substance abuse services under managed care, so that, on the margin, those getting into treatment were sicker. On the other hand, the income eligibility criteria for receiving state-funded non-Medicaid services dropped from 400% of the federal poverty level to 300% between FY 1994 and FY 1997, so some of the changes in case mix may have reflected the policy decision to be more restrictive in admissions, rather than a managed care effect.",

First, and perhaps most important, data were not available for a comparison group of patients who were not affected by the introduction of IMSACP, so it was not possible to tell whether the changes in treatment patterns between FY 1994 and FY 1997 were attributable to managed care or simply represented confounding secular time trends. A related problem was that the SARS data system changed slightly in FY 1996 (at the same time managed care was being introduced), so some of the service variables had to be cross-walked across years and may not have always been perfectly matched in their usage.",

Decreases in service use were observed in four of the seven treatment modalities. Decreases also were observed in more general measures of service use (ie, individual counseling, group counseling, and time spent in assessment). However, without knowing whether the reductions in service use were associated with better, worse, or similar treatment outcomes, it is impossible to know whether these changes in service use should be interpreted as improved provider efficiency in treating clients, or simply cost containment and profit maximization at the expense of client wellbeing. Additional study is required to assess the impact of substance abuse service decreases on client outcome.",
