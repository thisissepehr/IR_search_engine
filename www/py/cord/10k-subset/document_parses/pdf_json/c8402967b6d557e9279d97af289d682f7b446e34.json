Aspergillus can enter the body through spontaneous respiration and colonize in regions such as the nose and facial sinuses. The risk of tissue invasion and hematogenous secondary spread increases in immunosuppressed patients [1] . Immunosuppressive conditions such as chemotherapy, prolonged neutropenia, corticosteroid treatment, organ transplantation, and HIV infections predispose patients to develop invasive Aspergillus infections. In addition to the classical immunosuppressive conditions, invasive infections can also be rarely encountered with chronic obstructive lung disease, bacterial infections, usage of antibiotics, diabetes mellitus, or hemodialysis [2] . Aspergillus is first localized in the blood vessels and causes thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarct in the tissue and invasion of the distant organs through hematogenous spread [3] . The lungs are involved in invasive aspergillosis at a rate of 90-98 % followed by the central nervous system, and other organs such as the heart, liver, kidney and the gastrointestinal system [2, 3] . Invasive aspergillosis is rarely considered until characteristic fungal hyphae are observed during a pathological investigation. The diagnosis can be made by growing Aspergillus in culture or showing Aspergillus hyphae together with tissue invasion and/or destruction and mucosal changes in tissue biopsy [1, 3, 4] .

Increased acid secretion, disruption of the gastric mucosa barrier, mucosal ischemia and ulcer can predispose the gastric wall to the development of Aspergillus infection [3, 4] .
