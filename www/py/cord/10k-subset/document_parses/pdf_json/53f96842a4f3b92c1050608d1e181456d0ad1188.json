Impact of the Contact Rate, \u03b2 A significant source of uncertainty in a novel infectious disease is its level of infectiousness, i.e., how fast it will spread. To explore the robustness of our proposed control strategies to the infectivity of a disease, we conduct sensitivity for a range of contact rates.

As previously discussed, the focus of this work is to help guide control decision at the early stages of an outbreak, with the intention of preventing introductions into new cities and regions. Thus, the planning horizon focuses on the first weeks and months after a new disease has been identified. However, the impact of the chosen planning horizon is critical to quantify, as it directly relates to the budget, e.g., a longer planning horizon requires more days of screening, and therefore less airports can be controlled for the same budget. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to measure the impact of when this parameter is varied between 25 and 100 days and its impact on the control strategy performance is assessed. Figures S4a, S4b and S4c provide the results of the sensitivity analysis for scenarios MCO, PDX and HNL, respectively. As increases, the number of cumulatively infected individual grows quickly, highlighting the nonlinear growth of outbreaks. The relative impact of the best control strategies, MC and EP, continues to increase with , and critically, they consistently dominate in terms of performance across planning horizons, indicating the strategies are robust. For the MCO scenario, we find that the control strategies perform increasingly similarly when the observation time increases. This is not the case for the PDX scenario wherein increasing magnifies the differences of the control strategies in terms of performance. Finally, the HNL scenario is found to be the most robust to the variation of the observation time and this trend is also reflected more generally for this source city scenario.

Indeed, if airport \u2208 is fully controlled, i.e. = 1, our model assumes that all infected individuals are successfully detected in the screening process. In reality, this may not be the case. For example, Auckland International Airport's screening procedure for the 2009 influenza pandemic found that only 6% of infected passengers were detected 1 . This was partially due to the inability of the airport staff to screen all incoming passengers, as well as the limitations of the thermal scanning technology that was used. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies under imperfect control conditions. To explore the impact of imperfect control, we set upper bounds lower than 1 on the control rate at airports and measure performance in the base case scenarios. The outcome is reported Figure S6 .

Furthermore, if outgoing passenger screening is conducted at the outbreak source city, assuming a uniform effectiveness across all intended destinations, the relative performance proposed strategies still applies. This is illustrated in Figure S7 , which provides the different control strategy performances and ranking for source screening rates of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. At a 100% outgoing screening rate, no cases will ever leave the source city, thus all strategies perform equally, while the 0% outgoing screening rate corresponds to the base case results.

For all simulations the starting date of the outbreak is set as the 5 th of February 2009 with 1 infected individual placed into the city of Veracruz, Mexico 4 . Based on the analysis, the best fit disease parameters were found to be = 1, = 0.475, = 0.25 and = 1. A similar analysis was conducted at the global level, to compare the cumulative number of infected countries over time between the simulation and reported data, and illustrated in Figure  S9 . The difference between the observed 3 and simulated results is minimal; the difference between the cumulative number of infected countries at each date, averaged over the first 100 days, is less than one. The maximum discrepancy during the first 100 days occurs 90 days after the start of the outbreak, at which time the simulation predicts six less countries to be infected. To further validate the simulation model at a global level, explicit dates of first case arrivals for 10 countries known to be infected directly from Mexico are compared against the expected date of introduction from the simulation.
