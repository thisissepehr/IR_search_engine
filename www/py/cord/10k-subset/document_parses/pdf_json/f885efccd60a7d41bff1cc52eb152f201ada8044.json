These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T RM in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization. Our findings therefore have important implications regarding the generation of immune protection at mucosal surfaces by vaccination. O'Hara et al. ",

However, for a number of other mucosal pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, HIV-1, herpes simplex virus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, this approach has not been successful. Alternative vaccination strategies that are directed at generating more robust mucosal immunity, including cellular responses 1 , have been proposed.",

            "text": "In this vein, a promising approach has been the focus on mucosal immunization strategies [2] [3] [4] [5] . Following mucosal immunization, antigen-responsive T cells are activated in local draining lymph nodes. It is thought that activation in mucosa-associated lymph nodes leads to the expression of specific chemokine and adhesion receptors that facilitate selective access of effector T cells to mucosal tissue 6 , a process which may be enhanced by persistence of local antigen 7 . A subset of these recruited effector T cells can remain in the tissue and further differentiate into tissue-resident memory T cells (T RM ) that exhibit limited migratory potential [8] [9] [10] . These cells have the ability to respond rapidly to antigen rechallenge, thereby providing frontline immunity upon subsequent pathogen exposure [11] [12] [13] [14] . Based on these observations, the development of vaccines that can elicit T RM at mucosal surfaces has become an area of active investigation. One of the mucosal surfaces that is first encountered by many pathogens is the nasopharynx. For instance, colonization of the nasal pharynx with pneumococcus is an obligate first step for invasive pathogenesis, but the role played by T RM in protecting the nasopharynx from colonization remains incompletely elucidated. Specifically, it has been shown that prior infection of the lung with an avirulent pneumococcal strain results in the formation of protective tissue-resident CD4 + T cells within the lung, but whether prior colonization of the nose with pneumococci induces the formation of protective anti-pneumococcal CD4 + T RM has not been previously determined.",

We have studied a killed pneumococcal whole cell preparation that elicits protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasopharyngeal challenge [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . When delivered either intranasally (I.N.) with cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvant, or subcutaneously (S.C.) with alum, killed pneumococci can elicit a multi-pronged immune response. This includes protein antigen-specific antibodies that protect against invasive disease, as well as IL-17A-producing CD4 + T cells that protect against nasal colonization 19-22, 24, 25 . However, whether this vaccine induces CD4 + T RM in the nose and if so whether these are essential for protection of the nose from pneumococcal challenge remain to be determined. Further, it has been hypothesized that a significant advantage of mucosal immunization compared to parenteral administration might be the ability to generate mucosal T RM . However, the observation that the administration of killed pneumococci by S.C. injection mediates protection from nasal colonization raises the question of whether protection induced by this route of administration is also based on generation of mucosal T RM in the nasopharynx, potentially challenging the paradigm that generation of mucosal T RM requires mucosal vaccination.",

Further, we demonstrate that protective pneumococcal-responsive IL-17A + CD4 + T RM cells accumulate in the nose following either I.N. and S.C. administration of killed pneumococci. Finally, we show that nasal CD4 + T RM are essential for the recruitment of neutrophils necessary to limit colonization following nasal challenge of immunized mice. These data demonstrate that nasal CD4 + T RM can provide protection against nasal colonization with pneumococcus based on their ability to recruit neutrophils to the nasal mucosa. Potentially of greatest interest, these findings indicate that highly protective, long lasting mucosal T RM can be generated following parenteral vaccination, and thus have important implications for vaccine development.",

However the phenotype and location of the protective CD4 + T cell has not been determined. A protective role for CD4 + T RM at mucosal surfaces has recently been described for a number of bacterial pathogens of public health significance 1, 2, 27 . Exposure to live pneumococcus in the nasopharynx protects mice against subsequent homologous or heterologous pneumococcal challenge 20, 21 . Hence, we hypothesized that I.N. exposure to a pneumococcal strain (followed by clearance) would generate antigen-specific nasal CD4 + T RM that protect against subsequent pneumococcal colonization. To test this hypothesis, mice were exposed intranasally to live strain 0603 or PBS. One to two months later mice received APC-labeled anti-Thy 1.2 antibody by intravenous injection to discriminate between lymphocytes that were located intravascularly and those in the tissue parenchyma, and were then euthanized 5 minutes later. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from the nasal mucosa (NM), blood and spleen and evaluated by flow cytometry (gating strategies for the NM are shown in Supplementary Figure 1a ).",

The majority of CD4 + T cells within the NM were also protected from labeling with the Thy1.2 antibody, demonstrating their location in an extravascular compartment. Interestingly, in mice exposed to PBS alone, the percent of protected CD4 + T cells that expressed markers associated with a memory phenotype (T m , CD62L lo CD44 high ) was considerably higher in the NM than the spleen ( Fig. 1a and b) , and further, the percent of CD4 + Tm that expressed markers associated with tissue residency (CD69 and CD11a) was significantly higher in the NM than the spleen (Fig. 1c and d) . Remarkably, both the percent of nasal CD4 + T m ( Fig. 1a and b ) and the proportion of these cells that expressed CD69 and CD11a was significantly higher in mice previously exposed to 0603 compared to mice exposed to PBS alone ( Fig. 1c and d) .

Thus, we wondered whether, similar to nasal exposure to strain 0603, intranasal administration of WCV would induce protective T RM . To test this hypothesis, we vaccinated mice with WCV or CT intranasally and repeated one week later. One month after the final vaccination, mice were left untreated, treated with FTY720, or treated with a CD4-depleting antibody and then challenged intranasally with pneumococcus. Seven days later nasopharyngeal aspirates from mice vaccinated with CT alone had high concentrations of pneumococcus, while the concentration of pneumococcus in the nose of mice immunized with WCV was significantly reduced. Importantly, treatment with FTY720 did not interfere with protection ( Fig. 4a) , although as we have previously shown 21 , protection was completely abrogated following treatment with an anti-CD4 antibody.",

Consistent with the hypothesis that WCV induces protective T RM , we observed significantly higher numbers of CD69 + CD11a + CD4 + T m in the nose of mice immunized with WCV ( Fig. 4b and Supplemental Figure 4a ), as well as increased frequency and higher absolute numbers of IL-17A + CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4c , d, and Supplemental Figure 4b ) compared to those immunized with CT alone. Further, we found that total IL-17A secreted by nasal cells after ex vivo stimulation with WCA for 7 days was significantly higher in mice immunized with WCA compared to those immunized with CT O'Hara et al. Page 5 alone (Fig. 4e) . Finally, mice immunized I.N. with WCV and then treated with FTY720 prior to pneumococcal challenge also exhibited significantly higher density of both CD69 + CD11a + and IL-17A + CD4 + T cells and increased secretion of IL-17A in the nose compared to mice immunized with CT alone (and treated with FTY720). As expected treatment with the anti-CD4 antibody significantly depleted CD4 + T cells and interfered with IL-17A secretion following ex vivo stimulation ( Fig. 4b-e ). Taken together these observations strongly suggest that WCV induces protective pneumococcus-specific IL-17Aproducing CD4 + T RM within the nose following I.N. immunization with WCV.",

However, having demonstrated that I.N.-administered WCV induces the accumulation of protective CD4 + T RM within the NM, we wondered whether parenteral immunization might do the same. To address this question, mice were immunized three times at bi-weekly intervals S.C. with alum alone or WCV, and 4 weeks later single cell suspensions were prepared from mucosal sites (the NM and colonic lamina propria), as well as the spleen.

These observations indicate that S.C. vaccination with WCV induces the accumulation of IL-17A producing antigen-specific CD4 + T M at mucosal surfaces. In contrast, while IFN-Yproducing CD4 + T cells could be easily detected following P/I stimulation of cells isolated from both the NM and colon of either alum-or WCV-immunized mice, the frequency of these IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells detected within the nasal mucosa following stimulation with WCA was quite low (Fig. 5d) , suggesting that within the nasal mucosa, pneumococcusspecific T cell responses induced by WCV are strongly biased towards IL-17A (Fig. 5d ).",

To address this, histological sections prepared from the nasal cavity of mice from the groups described above in Figure 6a were stained with anti-CD4 and antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, and the absolute number of CD4 + T cells and neutrophils were enumerated. Mice that had been previously immunized with WCV demonstrated significantly higher numbers of both CD4 + T cells and neutrophils in the nasal mucosa following pneumococcal challenge than mice immunized with alum alone, and these differences in cell numbers remained in the presence of FTY720. In contrast, treatment with anti-CD4 antibody significantly reduced the number of both CD4 + T cell and neutrophil accumulation in mice immunized S.C. with WCV (Fig. 7a-c) . A potential caveat for this experiment is the limited sample size for the group treated with anti-CD4 antibody (n=5), although a small pilot experiment using mice immunized intranasally with WCV also demonstrated reduced neutrophil recruitment following treatment with anti-CD4 antibody (data not shown). Nontheless, these results indicate that WCV-induced neutrophil accumulation remains intact when recruitment of circulating effector T cells is blocked by FTY720, strongly suggesting nasal CD4 + T RM are sufficient to mediate both neutrophil recruitment and protection from nasal challenge.",

While our previous results had suggested that protection may be mediated by activation of pneumococcal-specific circulating Tm cells, we were surprised to find an abundance of antigen-specific memory T cells within the nose. Furthermore, our data employing FTY720 as well as staining for markers associated with tissue-residency, strongly suggest that antigen-specific resident (rather than recruited) T cells are sufficient for protection. Although it is theoretically possible that FTY720 could be trapping circulating effector cells within the tissues and it is these trapped cells that mediate protection, our observation that the majority of antigen-experienced CD4 + T cells isolated from the NM exhibit markers associated with T RM make this possibility unlikely. Future experiments applying alternative approaches such as parabiosis will help further delineate these issues.",

Prior data has suggested that parenteral vaccination is an ineffective approach for the generation of antigen-specific CD4 + T RMmediated protective responses within the respiratory tract 1, 29, 36 . For example, Zens and colleagues demonstrated that while FluMist administered to mice mucosally generated lung CD4 + T RM that provided heterosubtypic protection to influenza infection, such cells were not generated following parenteral administration of Fluzone, although in this study T RM generation was not evaluated in the nasopharynx 30 . In contrast, it has been suggested that the gut is permissive for T cell recruitment following parenteral immunization even in the absence of local stimulation 6 . Given that parenteral immunization with WCV was sufficient to generate antigen-specific T RM in the NM as well as the gut, we propose that the upper respiratory tract (URT) may also be permissive for T cell recruitment following parenteral immunization.",

This could be the result of either antigen alone or antigen-carrying antigen-presenting cells (APCs) migrating to the CLN. It has previously been suggested that CLN rather than nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) or spleen is the site of priming for antigen-specific Th17 cells generated following I.N. inoculation with Streptococcus pyogenes 48 . Furthermore, I.N. immunization with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can provide protection against nasal colonization in infant mice in the absence of NALT but not in the absence of the CLN 49 , but whether there is priming of antigen-specific T cells within the CLN following S.C. immunization with WCV remains to be determined. The specific APC population involved in the uptake and presentation of antigen to cognate T cells at inductive sites can also be important for optimal generation of T RM 50 , and thus identifying APC's involved in generating T RM within the nasopharynx should be an important goal of future studies.",

Nasal T RM generated after exposure to live pneumococcus are sufficient to mediate protection from secondary challenge. Mice were exposed to live pneumococcus (0603) or not (PBS), one month later treated with FTY720 (+FTY) or left untreated, then challenged I.N. with 0603. Nasal washes and tissue harvest were performed 7 days post-challenge. CD4 + T RM generated after mucosal immunization with WCV are sufficient to provide protection following nasal challenge with pneumococcus. Nasal washes and nasal tissue harvest were performed 4-7 days after challenge of mice immunized with CT or WCV and then left untreated, treated with FTY720, or anti-CD4 antibody (as indicated). Pneumococcus-responsive CD4 + T RM are detected in the nose and colon after parenteral immunization. Cells isolated from the NM, spleen or colon from groups of mice immunized with alum alone or WCV were analyzed by flow cytometry, either after staining with antibodies to identify CD4 + T RM , or 5 hours after stimulation with PMA/Ionomycin (P/I) or 24 hours after stimulation with WCA. WCV-induced CD4 + T RM generated after parenteral immunization provide long-lived protection and are generated early in life after a single dose. Mice immunized with alum alone or WCV were left untreated, treated with FTY720, or treated with anti-CD4 antibody as indicated, challenged I.N. with pneumococcus, and analyzed 10 days later. WCV-induced CD4 + TRM generated after parenteral immunization are sufficient to mediate neutrophil recruitment to the NM. Mice immunized with alum alone or WCV were left untreated, treated with FTY720, or treated with anti-CD4 antibody as indicated, challenged I.N. with pneumococcus, and nasal tissue was harvested 10 days later for analysis by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy.
