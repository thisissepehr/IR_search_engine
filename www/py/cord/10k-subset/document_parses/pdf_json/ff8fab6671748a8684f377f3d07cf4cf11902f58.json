            "text": "Abstract Lung transplantation has become a therapeutic option for patients with end stage lung disease. However, outcome after transplantation is complicated by episodes of rejection and infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a valuable tool in monitoring patients after transplantation, since it allows the detection of pathogens. A marker specifically indicating rejection from changes in BAL fluid has not been found yet. Especially changes in differential cell count, like lymphocytosis or an increase in polymorphnuclear granulocytes, are unspecific. The role of high eosinophil levels in BAL has not been elucidated yet. We analyzed 25 BAL samples and clinical data of 4 patients who underwent lung transplantation and presented with recurrent episodes of eosinophilic alveolitis in BAL. All patients demonstrated a deterioration of clinical condition, lung function, and blood gas analysis during times of eosinophilia in BAL, compared to previous examinations. In all cases, eosinophilia in BAL was accompanied by rejection. All patients were finally treated with high doses of steroids, resulting in improvement of all parameters. Eosinophilia was not associated with significant changes in the IL-5 concentration in BAL or the pattern of IL-5 expression in BAL cells. In conclusion, eosinophilic alveolitis may indicate acute rejection in patients after lung transplantation, if other causes of eosinophilia are excluded. lance of patients after lung transplantation. In this situation, careful analysis of cytological, microbiological, and clinical data becomes all the more important for the correct diagnosis and treatment of complications after lung transplantation. We report data demonstrating that some patients present with eosinophilic alveolitis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid early after transplantation. After exclusion of infections typically causing eosinophilic alveolitis, such as aspergillus, this finding may be indicative for acute rejection episodes.",

There were 12 BAL samples with increase of eosinophils ranging from 5 % to more than 60 % of the total cell number. 5 BAL samples demonstrated eosinophilia of 25 % or more. An increase in the number of eosinophils was accompanied by a raised number of neutrophils (Fig. 1 ). All patients fulfilled our criteria for indicating acute rejection. In most cases, treatment with steroids during episodes of eosinophilic alveolitis resulted in normalization of the clinical status, significant improvement of lung function, or reduction of infiltrates on chest x-ray. If control BAL samples were obtained after treatment, the number of eosinophils was found to be normal or significantly reduced. The course of patient A (transplantation for cystic fibrosis of the lung) is shown in Fig. 2 . Two of his BAL samples showing eosinophilic alveolitis (on 14\u00b107, not included in the Fig., and on 23\u00b107) were not followed by treatment.

In renal-and hepatic allografts, episodes of rejection were observed that were associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia [2, 11] . Our results indicate that eosinophils may play a significant role in lung allograft rejection, too. These findings are in keeping with prior animal and human studies. In a rat-lung allograft transplantation model, BAL eosinophilia was found to be a marker of rejection [14] . Histological examination of transbronchial biopsies of patients suffering from rejection showed eosinophils in less than half of the cases, but the number of cells was reduced after treatment with steroids [7] . In transbronchial biopsies of patients presenting with acute cellular rejection early after lung transplantation, 22 % of the samples displayed eosinophilic infiltrates if rejection was classified as mild. In cases of severe rejection, all samples had eosinophils indicating a correlation between the extent of tissue damage and the number of eosinophils. All cases with intense infiltrates of eosinophils (more than 50 % of infiltrating cells) observed in transbronchial biopsies within one month after transplantation, were associated with rejections. However, there was only one case described exhibiting BAL eosinophilia [32] . Riise et al. reported data demonstrating activation of eosinophils during rejection assessed by eosinophil cationic protein in BAL, but there was only one case of BAL eosinophilia of more than 10 % [18] . Results of our study indicate that after lung transplantation some patients show severe eosinophilic alveolitis during episodes regarded as rejection. To our knowledge, this is the first report about recurrent BAL eosinophilia in lung transplant recipients.",

Firstly, it should be a temporary finding. Secondly, simultaneous clinical signs of rejection should occur. Thirdly, active infective processes should be excluded. Fourthly, response to anti-rejection therapy must be proven [12] . All four criteria were fulfilled by our patients. It remains uncertain, however, why some patients demonstrate eosinophils in the BAL during episodes regarded as rejection after transplantation, and others do not. Most of our patients (33 out of 37) did not produce significant eosinophilia, although most of them showed episodes of rejection by the criteria mentioned above. There may be an association between the extent of rejection and the total number of eosinophils infiltrating affected tissue. Differences in adhesion of the eosinophils to the lung tissue may be involved as well. Blood eosinophilia was uncommon in our patients, with signs of rejection after lung transplantation suggesting the origin of the process to be the affected lung. Peripheral blood eosinophils may be normal during times of rejection, although a relative increase in eosinophil counts is considered a specific marker of rejection [26] .",

In patients with asthmatic symptoms, increased IgE and eosinophilia in combination with recovery of aspergillus, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) must be suspected. However, none of the 4 patients with BAL eosinophilia had signs of ABPA. Increased numbers of eosinophils after lung transplantation have been found in association with coxsackie A2 and pseudomonas aeruginosa infection as well [32] . Two of our patients had pseudomonas aeruginosa detectable in sputum or tracheal secretion. This pathogen was found consistently, with no association to periods of eosinophilia in BAL. Treatment with steroids would have been detrimental if pseudomonas were the pathogen causing decrease in clinical parameters of lung function. In one of the patients, corynebacterium jeikeium was detected during an episode of eosinophilic alveolitis, which however persisted after treatment with steroids, and resolution of eosinophilia and symptoms.

This might be true as well for eosinophilic inflammation during rejection episodes, since none of our patients demonstrated significant IL-5 levels in unconcentrated BAL. Even during episodes of significant eosino-philia, IL-5 was detectable at a concentration of only 13 pg/ml BAL fluid or lower, although there was a slight difference between episodes of eosinophilia and episodes without eosinophilia (median of 5.4 vs. 3.2 pg/ ml). The small number of samples analyzed limits the findings with regards to IL-5 concentrations. The difference may become significant in a larger study population. In chronic eosinophilic pneumonitis, increased levels of IL-5 in BAL fluid were observed in affected lung segments, corresponding to the extent of pulmonary eosinophilia [13] . Similar results were obtained in vivo, where anti-IL-5 antibody inhibits infiltration of eosinophils in a mouse model [15] , and in asthmatic patients. In symptomatic asthmatic patients with numbers of eosinophils higher than 1 10 6 /ml, IL-5 concentration in BAL was elevated to 274 pg/ml, whereas in patients with asymptomatic asthma, or with eosinophilic cell counts lower than 1 10 6 , IL-5 was below 13 pg/ml [23] . IL-5 in the BAL fluid of our patients was low even in the presence of high numbers of eosinophils. We therefore hypothesize, that eosinophilic inflammation during rejection episodes may be induced by cytokines different from IL-5, but known to be involved in eosinophilic inflammation, such as IL-3, GM-CSF and IL-8 [5, 25] . In-vitro studies demonstrated saline induced migration of eosinophils into peritoneum mediated by LTB4 that was released by resident mast cells and macrophages [5] . This process appears to be mediated either by IL-5 inducing a specific eosinophilic migration, or by IL-8 inducing a mixed migration of eosinophils and neutrophils [16] . BAL differential cell count from our study population showed significant amounts of neutrophils, suggesting the possibility of an IL-8 mediated process.",
