The 19.7% hospital mortality rate is consistent with earlier evidence of recent survival gains among critically ill HIV-infected patients [11, 17] . However, in the 2 latest series from the San Francisco General Hospital (1996-1999 and 2000-2004) , almost 40% of HIV-infected patients with ARF died before hospital discharge, and ARF was among the critical illnesses associated with the worst outcomes in HIV-infected patients [14, 15] . Comparable findings were obtained in the early ART era [4, 6, 7, 17] . The lower mortality rate in our patients cannot be ascribed to lesser disease severity. Severity of organ dysfunction was comparable to earlier studies, with onethird of patients requiring invasive MV and one-fourth requiring vasopressor support. Differences in terms of HIV-related characteristics, such as CD4 cell count and HIV viral load, should be taken into account for the comparison of short-term outcome between other recent series [4, [15] [16] [17] and ours. Nevertheless, and as in these previous studies, we found that these variables were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The introduction of ART does not explain the improved survival in our study. Fewer than one-third of our patients were on ART at ICU admission, in keeping with other studies [3, 11, 14, 15, 17] , and this percentage showed no significant changes over the study period. It has been shown that the use of ART, together with the CD4 T-cell count, influences long-term outcomes of HIVinfected patients after ICU discharge [2, 3] . Our data suggest, however, that ART may have no influence on short-term survival of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU for ARF. Similarly, no independent influence of ART on short-term outcome was noted in studies of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU for any reason [17, 23] . In our study, ART use was associated with nonopportunistic causes of ARF and CD4 T-cell counts were significantly lower in patients with opportunistic infections. However, it should be noted that among the 104 patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection, CD4 counts and viral load were available in only 67 and 64 patients, respectively. Nevertheless, the severity of organ failure at admission, as reflected by the SOFA score, was not different between patients receiving ART and those who did not. Moreover, survival was not significantly different across the 4 etiological groups, and HIV-related causes were not independently associated with death before hospital discharge. Thus, improved outcomes in patients with opportunistic pulmonary infections, mainly PCP, may contribute to explaining the lack of a survival advantage in patients on ART. PCP was an independent predictor of death in most of the previous studies of critically ill HIV-infected patients, particularly when MV was needed or pneumothorax occurred, with hospital mortality rates ranging from 45% to 80% [1, 7, 11, [14] [15] [16] [24] [25] [26] . Thus, the fact that PCP was slightly more frequent in other recent series [15, 16] could have contributed to the better overall survival in our cohort. However, the mortality rate in our patients with PCP was the lowest reported to date, and this cause was associated with the best short-term outcome. This difference cannot be ascribed to differences in steroids use, as steroids have been extensively prescribed to treat severe PCP since the early 1990s [27] . Recent improvements in the survival of HIV-infected patients with PCP are related to advances in respiratory support modalities, such as the routine use of pressure support ventilation [28] and protective ventilation for intubated patients with PCP [29, 30] , who consistently meet criteria for acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 302, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 381, "end": 406, "text": "(1996-1999 and 2000-2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 592, "end": 595, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 653, "end": 656, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 657, "end": 659, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 660, "end": 662, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 663, "end": 666, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1113, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1118, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1123, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1128, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1452, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1456, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1460, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1464, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1468, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1696, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1699, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1987, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 1991, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3071, "end": 3074, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3075, "end": 3077, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3078, "end": 3081, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3086, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3087, "end": 3091, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3092, "end": 3096, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3097, "end": 3101, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3102, "end": 3106, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3111, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3188, "end": 3192, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3196, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3570, "end": 3574, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3762, "end": 3766, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3826, "end": 3830, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3831, "end": 3834, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of hospital mortality included a need for invasive MV, a need for vasopressors, a longer time from hospital admission to ICU admission, and the presence of more than 1 cause of ARF. Transfer of HIV-infected patients from another ward to the ICU has been associated with higher mortality rates than ICU admission from the emergency room [8] . In another study, early intensive management improved the prognosis of patients with severe bacterial sepsis [31] . In our cohort, half the patients had ARF due to bacterial pneumonia, including 37.8% with septic shock. In two-thirds of the patients with bacterial pneumonia, faster ICU admission from the emergency room may have allowed earlier initiation of appropriate sepsis management. Thus, the lower hospital mortality rate compared to earlier studies [6, 32, 33] , most notably in patients with bacterial pneumonia, may be partly ascribable to the policy of prompt ICU admission from the emergency department at our hospital. Furthermore, our aggressive diagnostic strategy supplied the etiology of ARF in nearly all our patients. Establishing the etiological diagnosis has been shown to improve survival [34] . Thus, our results suggest that hospital mortality of HIV-infected patients with ARF depends chiefly on the severity of organ failure at admission and during the ICU stay and that improvement in-hospital survival results primarily from advances in intensive care practices, as opposed to improvement in immune status and use of ART.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 388, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 500, "end": 504, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 850, "end": 853, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 854, "end": 857, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 858, "end": 861, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our results support earlier evidence that bacterial pneumonia is now a major cause of ARF among HIVinfected patients [4, 6, 8] . ART reduces the risk of bacterial pneumonia during AIDS [35] , although HIVinfected patients with mild CD4 T-cell depletion remain at increased risk [36] . This may explain why, despite ART advent, bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent cause of ARF in our study. Two studies found a decrease in the incidence of PCP-related ARF early in the ART era [3, 4] . In our cohort, PCP was diagnosed in one-third of patients overall and was even more common among patients with previously unknown HIV infection. That incidence of PCP remains high is in keeping with recent series from San Francisco and London, where PCP was the most common etiology [15, 17] . The fact that more than half the cases of PCP occurred in patients who were aware of their HIV infection suggests inadequate compliance with PCP prophylaxis. Poor compliance may explain why the frequency of PCP remained unchanged throughout the study period, although the frequency of inaugural ARF tended to decrease. The proportion of noninfectious non-HIV-related causes of ARF was considerably higher than in studies done before the advent of ART [4, 6, 24 ]. The immune system reconstitution and increased life expectancy obtained with ART expose the patients to exacerbations of co-morbid conditions unrelated to HIV infection, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic heart failure.

Difficulties with the evaluation of adherence occur in all studies of HIV-infected patients, even those conducted prospectively. Third, our study was done in a single ICU, which may have led to patient selection bias.

Results: ARF revealed the diagnosis of HIV infection in 43 (29.2%) patients. Causes of ARF were bacterial pneumonia (n = 74), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP, n = 52), other opportunistic infections (n = 19), and noninfectious pulmonary disease (n = 33); the distribution of causes did not change over the 10-year study period.
