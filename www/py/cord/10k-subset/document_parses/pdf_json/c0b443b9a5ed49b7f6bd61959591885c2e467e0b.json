A count of _> 103 cfu/ml was used as the cutoff point for determining a positive culture. Cultures were performed according to standard procedures. For direct microscopic analysis, two slides were prepared by cytocentrifugation using a Shandon Cytospin 2 (Southern Product, UK). One May-Grtinwald-Giemsa stain and one Gram stain were made, using 140 ~1 of fluid for each slide. At least 20 high-power fields were examined. In 70% of the cases, microscopic examination was performed on the day of sampling before the results of culture were known. The presence of microorganisms was assessed on the stains. Morphology and staining characteristics of organisms seen on Gram stain were recorded. Direct examination for the presence of microorganisms was considered truly positive when at least one morphotype was seen and subsequently cultured (> 103 cfu/ml). The result was considered falsely positive when microorganisms were seen but not cultured in sufficient number. Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) were considered present when at least one cell per field was observed. To determine the percentage of PMNs, other inflammatory cells and bronchial cells -but not erythrocytes -were considered. Finally, the presence of intracellular organisms was investigated. If microorganisms were seen, the entire preparation was screened for intracellular organisms. At least three intracellular organisms had to be recognised without a doubt on either the Gram or the Giemsa stain. Samples containing 1% or more squamous epithelial cells were not evaluated. The unpaired Student's test was used to compare the means of two groups. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.",

Twenty-five samples were positive by quantitative culture, 15 of which were obtained from patients with previous antibiotic treatment, and ten from patients with no previous antibiotic therapy. The sensitivity of the presence of PMNs compared to positive culture was 96%, the specificity 33.3%, the positive predictive value 50%, and the negative predictive value 92.3 %. A differential cell count was performed for 48 samples. The percentage of PMNs was significantly higher in culturepositive samples (59% +_ 29) than in culturenegative samples (18.5% _+ 24) (p < 0.001); however, the range was very broad. Differential cell count does not seem to offer substantial diagnostic advantages. Although PMNs were frequently present in the preparations of culture-positive samples, they were also present in a large number of culture-negative samples. On the other hand, the probability of a positive culture was very low in the absence of PMNs.",

Initial studies (6, 7), which used slides with one drop of fluid directly placed onto each glass slide, showed a low sensitivity for Gram stain of PSB samples. Direct smear of the brush on the slide before washing in Ringer's lactate enhances the sensitivity of the direct examination (8) , although this procedure risks contamination of the sample and means a loss of material for culture, unless two separate brushes are used (9) . Cytocentrifugation is an effective method for increasing the number of cells and microorganisms in preparations for direct examination of body fluids (10). Recent data have shown that microscopic detection of intracellular organisms recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage is a specific method for early and rapid diagnosis of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients (7, (2) (3) (4) 12) . The cutoff point for a significant percentage of intracellular organisms present in bronchoalveolar lavage smears has been largely debated (2, 3, (12) (13) (14) . Our study shows that intracellular organisms may be recognised in PSB specimens. However, as the cells are sometimes distorted (probably due to the brushing procedure), they are more difficult to identify, and quantification may be problematic. We, therefore, determined that three intraceUular organisms had to be recognised without a doubt upon direct examination.",

The presence of microorganisms in Gram or Giemsa stains predicts fairly well the results of quantitative bacterial culture. In the absence of PMNs, a positive quantitative culture is unlikely. The presence of inflammatory cells containing intracellular organisms always corresponded with a positive culture in our study. ",

Western blot of paired serum samples from these same individuals was used as the gold standard. The dot blot tested had a sensitivity of 97.2% and a specificity of 100%; only two samples from HIV-infected individuals at Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stages II and IV were non-reactive. Reactive and discrepant samples (serum/urine) were confirmed by Western blot, which had a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 100%. The most commonly observed Western blot reactivity pattern in urine samples included bands against three groups of HIV structural proteins (ENV, POL, and GAG). The results indicate that urine can be used in screening for HIV antibodies in epidemiological studies of high-prevalence populations, though it is not recommended for individualized diagnostic purposes. increased demand for the capability to detect antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in different situations (diagnosis, epidemiological studies, etc.) calls for easily performed tests that enable large numbers of samples to be processed without requiring specialized equipment or personnel. It would also be desirable if such a test used a type of sample that is both easy to obtain and reliable as regards diagnostic results. Such a test could serve as a viable alternative to serological tests currently used in the diagnosis of Microbiology Laboratory Service, University Hospital, c/Ramdn y Cajal s. n., 47011 Valladolid, Spain.",
