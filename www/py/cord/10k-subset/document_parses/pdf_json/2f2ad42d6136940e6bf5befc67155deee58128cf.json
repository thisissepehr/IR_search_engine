The premises for use of ECMO in these patients, including ECMO-supported inter-hospital transfer, have been mainly the young age, the relatively low prevalence of comorbidities, and the likelihood for reversible lung failure typical of these patients [3] . Yet, there is uncertainty as to the risk-benefit balance of ECMO in patients with H1N1 infection, given variability in selection, procedural and logistic features involved in the implementation of such a technically demanding treatment [4] . Whereas H1N1 influenza virus is currently in the postpandemic period, regional outbreaks are still ongoing and thus defining more accurately the role of ECMO in this condition is clinically relevant [4] .
