Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-\u03b3 (chIFN-\u03b3) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-\u03b3 elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-\u03b3-induced immune responses. RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-\u03b3 significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection.

ND can infect 250 bird species via natural or experimental routes [2] . Wild migratory waterfowl, especially aquatic birds, can act as a reservoir host for most of the viruses that possess the pandemic potential and are known to be actively transmitted to other avian species. With the passage of time, it has gained serious attention with the viral evolution and re-emergence in the Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-infected susceptible birds [3] [4] [5] [6] . To date, very few studies have been conducted to elucidate the NDV-mediated pathogenesis in birds, especially in the chickens. So, it is of great concern to regularly undermine and update the latest knowledge about NDV-induced immune responses in chicken. Specifically, the patterns of disease progression and the outcome significantly vary on viral strain and subtype. Therefore, the virulent NDV strain may cause severe lesions or even death in an infected chicken. Compared with chickens, ducks often show intermittent, prolonged NDV shedding [7] . Additionally, it has also been revealed that a strong humoral response is generated against NDV in chickens. Though previous studies have demonstrated that NDV replication occurs in respiratory system and lymphoid organs of chickens, there are still loop holes in viral-mediated immune escape [7] .

Surprisingly, in our experimental settings, we were unable to observe this response. This may be due to multiple reasons, including the use of different viral genotypes, the origin and source of virus, and the type of cells used to determine the NDV-mediated pathogenesis in different bird species [53] . Collectively, based on our experimental findings, we can postulate that the temporal induction of IFNs in response to NDV infection in CEFs is dependent on certain factors, including viral genotype, viral source, cell type, mode of infection, and time points of NDV infection in cells. CEFs are an invaluable tool for investigating the interactions between avian viral pathogens and immunerelated genes. Since viral infection can be controlled in a cell culture system, specific changes in molecular and cellular architecture can be observed and characterized. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits influenza virus replication [73, 74] . Different research groups have tried to investigate the antiviral role of IFNs, but none have managed to elucidate the chIFN-\u03b3-induced antiviral response against NDV infection in CEFs. In this work, in order to evaluate the immune state elicited by chIFN-\u03b3 in CEFs, the released NDV viral particles were counted in culture medium with and without chIFN-\u03b3 treatment. A reduction in viral load indicated that chIFN-\u03b3 actively reduced the NDV viral population. Significantly, published reports showed that ISGs have antiviral activities against NDV infection [9] . These results suggested that stimulation of the innate immune response prior to NDV infection inhibits viral propagation and the release of viral progeny. These findings provided a better insight into the innate immune responses triggered by deadly viral pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 307, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 308, "end": 311, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 612, "end": 616, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1267, "text": "[73,", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1271, "text": "74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1833, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Innate immune signaling in Aves is an extremely diverse, multifaceted, integrated, and precise process that relies on many different aspects.

An extensive and inclusive study involving a broad range of genes related to immunity and several IFNs that compare and connect the unified function is required to provide a comprehensive understanding of the innate immune response cascade.
