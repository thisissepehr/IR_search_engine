An unexpected finding was that cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity showed a progressive increase with advancing age. A slight but significant increase in the activity of 21-hydroxylase was also noted in adrenal microsomal fractions from senescent rats.

Several mechanisms might account for the stimulatory effect of aging on cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity. One possibility is an augmentation of enzyme synthesis. In addition, if degradation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme protein were to proceed at a lower rate than in young rats, the levels of this enzyme would be expected to be higher, since the steady state level of any given protein is achieved by its relative rates of synthesis and degradation. A second possibility may be that an increased activity represents cellular adaptive changes to deal with the diminished capacity of the adrenal gland to mobilize and use cholesterol esters for steroidogenesis. Indeed, we have recently shown that cholesterol ester content increases with age and that this defect was related to specific changes in neutral cholesterol esterase (Popplewell, P. Y., and S. Azhar, submitted). Thus, an increase in cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity can be viewed as a compensation on the part of the enzyme to the elevated cholesterol esters levels. That is, mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzymes increase in activity in order to effectively use that cholesterol which becomes available from the stored cholesterol ester. However, the fact that the adrenal steroidogenic response is still blunted in senescent rats demonstrates this to be a partially successful compensation. Another possibility of equal importance is that the observed increase in cholesterol side-chain activity may be in response to vastly elevated levels of plasma ACTH, previously reported in senescent rats (37) . This hyperstimulation hypothesis is supported by the observations that the cholesterol side-chain cleavage step is the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis and, as such, activated/regulated by ACTH (2, 4, 5) . Finally, evidence has recently been presented to support the idea that adrenal mitochondria contain more than one cholesterol side-chain cleavage system (38) (39) (40) . Thus, it is conceivable that elevated levels represent stimulation of only one isoenzymic form which may or may not actively participate in steroidogenesis under in vivo situations. Obviously more rigorous experimental approaches are needed to sort out these various possibilities. Such investigations are currently in progress in our laboratory.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 206, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 207, "end": 210, "text": "36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1808, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2013, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2016, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2019, "text": "5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2179, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2184, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2189, "text": "(40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We were unable to document any age-related changes in mitochondrial cytochrome P450 levels.

In addition, a pool of cytochrome P450 not associated with steroidogenic enzymes (i.e. cytochrome P450 8CC or cytochrome P450 U/ 3) may exist (12) , which, in turn, could mask a real age effect on specific cytochrome P450 8CC . The above hypothesis is of interest in view of the previous finding demonstrating a dissociation in half-lives of 21-hydroxylase and cytochrome P450 (4.5 vs. 2.9 days) in rat adrenals after hypophysectomy (12) . Additional evidence for this hypothesis is the recent finding of Naumoff and Stevenson (43) , who observed a delayed developmental maturation pattern for cholesterol side-chain activity compared to cytochrome P450 in rat ovaries after gonadotropin treatment. In view of these observations, it is not unreasonable to speculate that levels of cytochrome P450 and side-chain cleavage are modulated differentially as rats grow old.
