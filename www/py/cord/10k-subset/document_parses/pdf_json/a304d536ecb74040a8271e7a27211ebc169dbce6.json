Concerning the prognostic value, the serum PCT level was higher for bacteremic patients and/or septic shock patients (4.9 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml; p = 0.0003). Moreover, PCT levels were increased in patients who developed, during their ICU stay, infection-related complications (septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation). Finally, the initial PCT level was significantly higher in patients who died during the ICU stay (5.6 ng/ml vs 1.5 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). Such a relationship was not found with C-reactive protein (CRP).

These results suggest that this marker is not an interesting tool to diagnose severe CAP. However, to assess CAP severity PCT appears to be a better indicator: a high level is associated with a high incidence of bacteremia, severe sepsis, infection-related complications, and finally, mortality. During the last decade, the measurement of procalcitonin became a common tool in infectious diseases management, particularly in sepsis with bacteremia [29, 30, 38] . However, sensitivity and specificity of this parameter remain low in localized [5] or moderate infections [31, 32] . Studies evaluating PCT in CAP are sparse and, most of the time, with a limited number of patients. Studies focusing on patients with moderately severe CAP without sepsis demonstrated that the increase in PCT was not constant (60% of the patients) [8, 9] , and moderate (usually < 0.5 ng/ml) [10, 11] . Only one study was performed in patients exhibiting severe CAP requiring ICU admission: the median PCT value was > 2 ng/ml [14] . Our data are consistent with this result; however, we must underline that, even if the mean PCT level on ICU admission was far over the cutoff value set at 2 ng/ml, only 50% of our patients had an initial PCT level \u2265 2 ng/ml. Moreover, for 20% of the patients, the PCT value < 0.5 ng/ml.

In experimental studies, animals receiving PCT had, compared with controls, a higher mortality rate, whereby an injection of an antiserum directed against procalcitonin improved survival [38, 39] . In clinical studies, a correlation between mortality rate and PCT level on admission was reported in most publications including patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [28, 40] . Some authors even proposed to include the PCT level in scores assessing sepsis severity on ICU admission [41] . In a few studies, although a correlation between PCT level on admission and survival did not appear, an increase in PCT levels within the first 48 h following admission appeared as a risk factor of death, whereas a decrease was associated with a better outcome [30, 42] . In CAP, the initial PCT level was not so clearly related to prognosis. Brunkhorst et al. [14] studied 93 patients with severe CAP and ventilator-associated pneumonia in an ICU, the median initial PCT level was 2.3 ng/ml. PCT levels were measured daily during the first 5 days of hospitalization and never correlated with prognosis. However, the authors underlined that an increase in PCT levels at the end of the observation period was a poor prognostic factor. In a second study reporting 96 patients with moderately severe CAP, PCT was not correlated to mortality, but the median PCT level was 0.2 ng/ml and only two patients died [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 364, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 365, "end": 368, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 544, "end": 548, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 549, "end": 552, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 933, "end": 936, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1575, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has several limitations: first, recent studies showed that the PCT level decreases rapidly after hospital admission for CAP [9, 14] .

For the same reason, we did not perform repeated samples to evaluate PCT kinetics. Second, our method can only measure a PCT level > 0.5 ng/ml. It was recently shown in CAP that values from 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml could help diagnose a bacterial origin and guide antibiotic treatment [13] .
