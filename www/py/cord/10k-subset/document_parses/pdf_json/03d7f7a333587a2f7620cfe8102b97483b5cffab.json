Viral infectivity persisted for less than 6 hr at 37 C in nutrient broth. Survival of virus was enhanced in the presence of cysteine and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide, and at pH 5.5. Survival was also enhanced in a growing culture of intestinal microflora and could be observed as well in a culture of Streptococcus [ecalis in medium with reduced oxygen tension. These results were compared with findings in experiments with several other intestinal viruses, and it is suggested that some intestinal viruses may be adapted to the conditions of low pH and redox potential that are normal in the intestine.",
