A phylogenetic tree that was constructed with 369 bp of VP1 gene nucleotide sequences showed that modern EV-D68 strains were divided into three primary clades (A, B and C) according to the classification previously described by Tokarz (Fig. 2) 4 . Nearly full-length nucleotide sequences that correspond to nt 145-7203 of the EV-D68 prototype strain (GenBank accession no. AY426531) were obtained from 13 strains of EV-D68 in the current study. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on this region of nucleotide sequences with the 13 strains from Chongqing (Ten strains from 2014, two strains from 2013, and one strain from 2012), seven strains from the 2014 US outbreak and available EV-D68 sequences that were long enough (Fig. 3 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 297, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 295, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 780, "end": 787, "text": "(Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Patients and sample collection.
