For patients with acute anemia or deficient/inadequate levels of hemostatic factors, transfusion of normal donor blood or an appropriate component is a lifesaving treatment. However, donor blood has limitations: limited supply, requires typing and crossmatching, a short storage life, and a risk of disease transmission (e.g., hepatitis, AIDS). A substitute for red cells or other blood component that can overcome these limitations would be highly desirable. Basic principles and recent progresses on the development of red cell substitutes (RCSs), artificial platelets, recombinant clotting factors, and artificial antibodies are discussed with a primary focus on the RCSs.",

            "text": "Because red blood cells in the blood deliver essential oxygen to tissues and organs, in acute anemia caused by traumatic hemorrhage or other causes, lost oxygen carrying capacity must be promptly restored or could be fatal. Allogeneic donor blood (red cell) transfusion is effective but has limitations mentioned above. For this reason, search for a RCS has been ongoing for decades but only recently have a few candidates reached active clinical testing [1] . Blood types are generally classified based on presence of AB and Rh antigens on the red cell membrane surface. In most transfusions, simple ABO/Rh blood typing is sufficient to match appropriate donor blood. Occasionally, however, patients with rare red cell antigens do present difficulty in identifying matching blood donors. More often, compatibility problems occur in patients who must receive chronic transfusions (e.g., sickle cell anemia or thalassemia patients). In such patients, alloimmunization against minor red cell antigens makes it difficult to find appropriate donors. There have been efforts to create universal donor red cells. The red cell surface antigens were neutralized or masked using polyethylene glycol (PEG) or its derivatives. Covalent binding of PEGs to RBCs do appear to mask the RBC surface antigens thereby opening possibilities of transfusion of heterologous or even xenogeneic RBCs. In one recent study [2] , Type A or B human RBCs modified with methoxyPEG showed decreased anti-A or anti-B antibody binding. Furthermore, methoxyPEG modified sheep RBCs were resistant to phagocytosis by human peripheral blood monocytes. In another approach, red cell A or B antigens were enzymatically removed by exoglycosidase treatment but was only partially successful [3] . These 'stealth' red cell approaches may obviate incompatibility problems but are yet to deal with issues of limited supply and potential disease transmission.",

Stroma-free Hb (SFH), a purified Hb solution free of red cell membrane stroma as cellfree Hb in a physiologic solution, can still reversibly bind and deliver oxygen. Because there is no antigenic red cell membrane in SFH solution, it can be used as a universal resuscitation fluid for recipients with any blood type. This SFH, however, was found to have two perceived shortfalls: SFH was perceived to have too high an oxygen affinity (P50 of 10~15 mmHg versus 26~28 mmHg for normal red cell Hb) and too short an intravascular circulation half-time (T 1/2 < 1.5 h) to be useful. Acellular free SFH has a higher oxygen affinity than native intra-erythrocytic Hb because 2,3diphosphoglycerate (DPG) normally present in the red cells is lost during purification. The high oxygen affinity was perceived as detrimental to optimal oxygen offloading to tissues. Acellular tetrameric Hb (\u03b1 2 \u03b2 2 ) in solution readily dissociates into \u03b1\u03b2 dimers that are easily filtered through the kidneys and excreted in the urine. The HBOCs in clinical testing today are Hbs chemically or genetically \"engineered\" to produce desirable oxygen offloading characteristics and an extended circulation half-time. Key approaches of HBOCs currently in development as red cell substitutes are briefly described below.",

            "text": "One way to alleviate the high oxygen affinity of SFH is through the use of functional DPG analogs that specifically attach to the DPG pocket. For example, the negatively charged pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) is a DPG analog that specifically interacts with the positively charged amino residues of the DPG binding site (e.g., Lys 82\u03b2, His2\u03b2, and His143\u03b2) [4] . The reactive aldehyde group of PLP is used to crosslink PLP to the primary amino groups of the DPG pocket (valines of \u03b21 and \u03b22) via a Schiff reaction which is then reduced forming a covalent bond. Pyridoxylated SFH (PLP-Hb) has a near normal oxygen affinity (P 50 = 22~24 mmHg) but is still dissociable into \u03b1\u03b2-dimers susceptible to renal excretion because there is no inter-dimeric crosslinkage. Using a DPG analog with bifunctional aldehydes (e.g., 2nor-2-formyl pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate; NFPLP), low oxygen affinity Hb with an inter-dimeric linkage between the two primary valines of \u03b21 and \u03b22 subunits (\u03b2 stabilized Hb) was produced [5] . Hb can also be stabilized using an \u03b1-specific crosslinker bis(3,5-dibromo salicyl)-fumarate (DBBF or diaspirin) to produce 99\u03b11-99\u03b12 crosslinked Hb (DCLHb). DCLHb has been shown to have a P50 of 30 mmHg and substantially longer intravascular circulation time than unmodified SFH.",

            "text": "Intravascular retention times of HBOCs can be further increased by intermolecular crosslinking (polymerization) of stabilized Hbs using bi-or poly-functional crosslinkers. For example, PLP-Hb can be polymerized using glutaraldehyde, a bifunctional nonspecific crosslinker, to produce poly(PLP-Hb) with t 1/2 of over 30 h following a partial exchange transfusion in adult baboons [6] . PolyHeme \u00ae (Northfield Labs., Chicago, IL, USA), a poly(PLP-Hb) product, is being tested in Phase III clinical trial in the USA. A low oxygen affinity oligomeric HBOC with desirable circulation characteristics has been produced using ring-opened raffinose (o-raffinose), a hexafunctional crosslinker [7] . With this unique crosslinker prior intra-molecular stabilization is unnecessary. At 10 g Hb/dL, this o-raffinose HBOC delivers 4.3 mL O 2 /dL under the normal arterio-venous oxygen gradient, close to the nor-mal oxygen delivery capacity of blood. The o-raffinose modified Hb (Hemolink \u00ae by Hemosol, Inc., Toronto, Canada) was shown to reduce blood transfusion requirement in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery [8] . An alternative approach to circumvent the high oxygen affinity and limited availability of human SFH is to utilize naturally low O 2 affinity bovine Hb as a starting material [9] . Bovine Hb has a naturally low oxygen affinity compared to human Hb (P 50 = 30~32 mmHg). It is not DPG dependent and can be directly polymerized without prior modification to achieve desired the oxygen affinity and circulation time [10] . Potential immunogenicity and transmission of animal borne disease such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) could be of concern with these products.",

To meet the metabolic oxygen demand, the fraction of O 2 in the inspired gas (FiO 2 ) patients were required to breathe were 100% oxygen (i.e., FiO 2 = 1.0), a situation to be avoided clinically due to the adverse effects of elevated oxygen concentration on the lungs (e.g., oxygen toxicity).",

San Diego, CA, USA), a stable 60% (w/v) emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide (perflubron) has been developed using egg yolk phospholipid as the sole emulsifying agent. Under normal arterial and venous oxygen tensions, Oxygent \u00ae can unload as much as 1.3 mL oxygen per 100 mL, a remarkable improvement in oxygen delivery capacity (ODC). Yet, the oxygen delivery capacity of Oxygent \u00ae is less than 30% of normal blood (5 mL O 2 /100 mL blood at 15 g Hb/dL) and may still require oxygen enriched air breathing to ensure adequate oxygen delivery. This product has been tested in Phase II/III clinical trials in the USA. and other countries but the trials were suspended due to higher than expected rate of stroke in treated patients [24] . Of note, a new PFBOC formulated as stable microbubbles has been developed. It is reported to dissolve a sufficient amount of O 2 so that it can be used for ultra small volume (1/500 of typical perfluorocarbon dose) resuscitation applications [25] .",

For example, in the early 1970s, commercial factor VIII and FIX concentrates from pooled human plasma became available for treatment of hemophiliacs. However, pooled plasma could transmit infectious pathogens although these risks have decreased substantially over the last decade due to improvements in donor screening, improved test assays, and viral inactivation. In addition, transfusion of blood products causes immunologic complications including serum sickness and acquired antibodies against specific coagulation factors. These problems have lead to development of recombinant clotting factors as safer treatments for bleeding patients.",

Antibodies raised in animals or animal sources against specific pathogen are already in wide use to prevent/treat serious infectious diseases (e.g., vaccines against meningitis, small pox, and influenza). However, although animal antibodies are effective, they could cause severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock). To avoid such reactions, human antibodies should be developed and used. Recent advances in genetic engineering technology enabled us to produce completely human antibodies for therapeutic purposes. For example, using a combinatorial infection technique (phage technique), a very large human Ig-Vgene library approaching 10 11 in diversity was created with human germline V-gene segment and synthetic joining segments [29] . From this library, antibodies against a plethora of antigens could be produced with high affinities. Human antibodies could also be obtained from transgenic animals that carry a restricted set of human immunoglobulin genes. With immunization and immortalization, human hybridoma with high affinities could be obtained. Therapeutic antibodies with two antigen binding specificities (bi-specific antibodies and diabodies) can also be produced. Diabody directed against surface Ig idiotype of lymphoma and the T-cell CD3 co-receptor expressed in E. coli was shown to be effective in recruiting T-cells to kill lymphoma cells in vitro [30] . With rapid advances in genomics, proteinomics, and rational design methods, it would soon be possible to create on-demand artificial antibodies with desired specificities and affinities. Such technology would help develop prevention and treatment against fast evolving highly virulent infectious pathogens (e.g., influenza and SARS viruses).",
