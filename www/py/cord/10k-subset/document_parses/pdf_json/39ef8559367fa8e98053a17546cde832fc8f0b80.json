Scattered lymphadenopathy can be explained by all three categories of disease, but sepsis is the acute concern. His cough, bilateral crackles, and hypoxia signal a diffuse parenchymal lung process; most commonly this will be a bacterial pneumonia. Fever and rash is often caused by viral exanthems such as Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); while each causes lymphadenopathy and fever, primary pulmonary disease is unusual. Acute influenza frequently leads to pneumonia, but rash is not characteristic. Bacterial infections like endocarditis, meningococcemia, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever all warrant early consideration with fever and a diffuse petechial rash, although he does not have any epidemiologic risk factors for these conditions. A bacterial pneumonia with bacteremia could cause cutaneous vasculitis, but scattered lymphadenopathy is not part of that picture. While disseminated endemic fungal infections can cause fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary disease, an acute presentation with widespread skin lesions would be more likely in an immunocompromised patient. The rash does not have the typical appearance or pain of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, but environmental and medication exposures should be queried nonetheless. Sarcoidosis affects each of the involved organs in this case, but is usually more indolent. Vasculitis and other autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated diseases are possible but less likely. The same could be said for malignancy, which rarely presents with this degree of acuity, save for aggressive hematologic cancers.",

Experience also allows the clinician to recognize an unexpected data point as more than a variation, but instead as a deviation that invites consideration of other diagnoses. For example, unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy can be seen in lobar pneumonia, but symmetric, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is too unusual for pneumonia and will invite consideration of sarcoidosis, which can also present as a fever, cough, and infiltrate. power (a, b) .

The inflammatory response was not controlled with antibiotics and no source of infection was identified, so attention turned from sepsis to sepsis mimickers.
