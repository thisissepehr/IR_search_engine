Spontaneous breathing presents a clinically important risk of injury to the lung and diaphragm. While clinicians are primarily focused on monitoring lung function to prevent ventilatorinduced lung injury (VILI) during passive mechanical ventilation, less attention may be paid to the risk of VILI during assisted mechanical ventilation. Vigorous spontaneous inspiratory effort can cause both lung injury (patient self-inflicted lung injury [P-SILI]) [1, 2] and diaphragm injury (myotrauma) [3, 4] . These injuries lead to prolonged ventilation, difficult weaning, and increased morbidity and mortality [5] [6] [7] . Safe spontaneous breathing presents a complex challenge because one must aim to minimize the volume and transpulmonary pressure (P L ) to avoid P-SILI while also maintaining an appropriate level of patient respiratory effort to avoid diaphragm atrophy. To this end, respiratory monitoring is key.

Of note, the low level of respiratory effort required to trigger the ventilator is not sufficient to avoid disuse atrophy [3] , such that diaphragm atrophy can occur under pressure support ventilation. Excessive concentric loading. The diaphragm is sensitive to excessive respiratory load. Higher inspiratory patient effort, dyssynchronies, and under-assistance due to an insufficient level of support are frequent in assisted mechanical ventilation. Vigorous concentric contractions provoke high muscular tension resulting in muscle inflammation, proteolysis, myofibrillar damage, and sarcolemma disarray [13, 14] .

Eccentric contractions occur when a muscle generates contractile tension while . During passive ventilation, the pleural pressure swing is positive and transpulmonary pressure is therefore lower than airway pressure (P aw ). During assisted ventilation a vigorous inspiratory effort generates a negative swing in pleural pressure resulting in an additive increase in transpulmonary pressure; transpulmonary pressure may therefore be much higher than airway pressure. P es esophageal pressure it is lengthening (rather than shortening); such contractions are much more injurious than concentric (shortening) contractions [16] .
