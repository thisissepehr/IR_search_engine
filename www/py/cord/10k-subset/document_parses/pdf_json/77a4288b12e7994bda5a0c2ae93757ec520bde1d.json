In humans, the central processing center controlling the thermoregulatory set-point is the hypothalamus. Both warm-sensitive and cold-sensitive thermoreceptors are involved in the aff erent limb. Stimulation of the coldsensitive receptors activates eff erent responses relayed via the hypothalamus that reduce heat loss and increase heat production. Th ese responses include reducing blood fl ow to the peripheries and increasing heat production by mechanisms including shivering.

Th is activation leads to production of pyrogenic cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Th ese pyrogenic cytokines act on an area of the brain known as the organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis (OVLT) leading to the release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) via activation of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). PGE 2 binds to receptors in the hypothalamus leading to an increase in heat production and a decrease in heat loss until the temperature in the hypothalamus reaches a new, elevated, set-point. Once the new set-point is attained, the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis around this new set-point by the same mechanisms involved in the regulation of normal body temperature. However, in addition, there are a number of important specifi c negative feedback systems in place that prevent excessive elevation of body temperature. One key system is the glucocorticoid system, which acts via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Both these mediators have anti-infl ammatory properties and downregulate the production of pyrogenic cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1.

Th ey represent an important system providing protection to cells, not only against extremes of temperature, but also against other potentially lethal stresses including toxic chemicals and radiation injury. During heat-stress, transcription and translation of HSPs is upregulated. HSPs can then trigger refolding of heat-damaged proteins preserving them until heat-stress has passed or, if necessary, can transport denatured proteins to organelles for intracellular degradation. As well as providing protection against cellular damage from the thermal stress induced by fever, the HSPs may themselves be important regulators of the febrile response.

Murine macrophages demonstrate a range of enhanced functions at temperatures in the febrile range.

As COX catalyzes the generation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, this suggests that the pivotal role of PGE 2 in the regulation of the thermostatic set-point may be preserved in these species as well as in higher animals. Such a common biochemical mechanism to regulate fever across such a diverse group of animals raises the possibility that the febrile response may have evolved in a common ancestor. If this is the case, then fever probably emerged as an evolutionary response more than 350 million years ago [13] . As the febrile response comes at a signifi cant metabolic cost [4] , [5] , its persistence across such a broad range of species provides strong circumstantial evidence that the response has some evolutionary advantage.

Th e conservation of a metabolically costly response across a broad range of animal species suggests that the response probably has an evolutionary advantage. Th ere are some interesting historical examples of hyperthermia being employed to treat infectious diseases. However, in the modern era the relevance of these examples is questionable. Furthermore, arguments based on the evolutionary importance of the febrile response do not necessarily apply to critically ill patients who are, by defi nition, supported beyond the limits of normal physiological homeostasis. Humans are not adapted to critical illness. In the absence of modern medicine and intensive care, most critically ill patients with fever and infection would presumably die. Among critically ill patients, it is biologically plausible that there is a balance to be struck between the potential benefi ts of reducing metabolic rate that come with fever control and the potential risks of a deleterious eff ect on host defense mechanisms. Remarkably, at present, we do not know what eff ect treating fever in critically ill patients with infections has on patient-centered outcomes.
