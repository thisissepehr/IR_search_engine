Although brush border maldigestion can occur if infection extends to the proximal region of the small intestine, Ciyptosporidium mainly causes malabsorption by the massive occupation by protozoa of the absorptive surface and villous atrophy(Tzipori 1988). Diarrhoea occurs as a result of overgrowth of intestinal microflora and changes in osmotic pressure. Compared to coccidiosis, diarrhoea in cryptosporidiosis is milder and non-haemorrhagic.The role of Cryptosporidium infection in the aetiology of diarrhoea of immunocompetent foals is not certain. Although Ciyptosporidium infection was implicated as the cause of diarrhoea by some researchers(Gajadhar et  a/. 1985; Lengronne et a/. 1985; DiPietro et a/. 1988), others found no Ciyptosporidium infection in diarrhoeic foals (Reinemeyer et a/. 1984; Soule el a/. 1983; Chermette et a/.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "a/. 1985; DiPietro et a / . 1988; Fernandez et a/. 1988; Coleman et a/. 1989). but it is usually selflimited and lasts 1-8 days (Coleman et a/. 1989). Although high mortality has been reported in this group of animals (DiPietro et a/. 1988; Fernandez et a/. 1988). it was probably the result of concomitant infections. Diarrhoea in older foals infected with Cryptosporidium is frequently chronic and remittent. It lasts for several months and can still be present when foals are 9-10 months old (Lengronne et a/. 1985; Chermette et a/. 1987;", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "on the small intestinal mucosa (Snyder et a/. 1978; Gibson et al. 1983; Gajadhar et a/. 1985; Poonacha and Tuttle 1989; Mair et a/. 1990). In tissue sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin, developmental stages of Cryptosporidium appear as spherical basophilic bodies (2-5 pm in diameter) over the crypts and along the sides of intestinal villi (Snyder et a/. 1978; Gibson et a/. 1983). Special staining procedures (Wolbach-Giemsa) were used by some researchers without achieving any improvement (Snyder et a/. 1978; Gibson et a/. 1983). Transmission electron microscopy can be used to confirm the diagnosis (Snyder et a/. 1978; Gajadhar et a/. 1985; Poonacha and Tuttle 1989). The presence of a feeder organelle is unique to Cryptosporidium. Cryprosporidium infection in living horses is diagnosed by finding oocysts in faeces.
