            "text": "Hollow protein containers are widespread in nature, and include virus capsids as well as eukaryotic and bacterial complexes. Protein cages are studied extensively for applications in nanotechnology, nanomedicine and materials science. Their inner and outer surfaces can be modified chemically or genetically, and the internal cavity can be used to template, store and/or arrange molecular cargos. Virus capsids and virus-like particles (VLP, noninfectious particles) provide versatile platforms for nanoscale bioengineering. Study of capsid protein self-assembly into monodispersed particles, and of VLP structure and biophysics is necessary not only to understand natural processes, but also to infer how these platforms can be redesigned to furnish novel functional VLP. Here we address the assembly dynamics of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a complex icosahedral virus. IBDV has a ~70 nm-diameter T = 13 capsid with VP2 trimers as the only structural subunits. During capsid assembly, VP2 is synthesized as a precursor (pVP2) whose C terminus is cleaved. The pVP2 C terminus has an amphipathic helix that controls VP2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP3 scaffolding protein, necessary for control of assembly, 466/456-residue pVP2 intermediates bearing this helix assemble into VLP only when expressed with an N-terminal His 6 tag (the HT-VP2-466 protein). HT-VP2-466 capsids are optimal for genetic insertion of proteins (cargo space ~78 000 nm 3 ). We established an in vitro assembly/disassembly system of HT-VP2-466based VLP for heterologous nucleic acid packaging and/or encapsulation of drugs and other molecules. HT-VP2-466 (empty) capsids were disassembled and reassembled by dialysis against low-salt/basic pH and high-salt/acid pH buffers, respectively, thus illustrating the reversibility in vitro of IBDV capsid assembly. HT-VP2-466 VLP also packed heterologous DNA by non-specific confinement during assembly. These and previous results establish the bases for biotechnological applications based on the IBDV capsid and its ability to incorporate exogenous proteins and nucleic acids.",

Efficient self-assembly of capsid protein (CP) is based on its built-in conformational flexibility and extensive use of symmetry (icosahedral or helical) [2] . To facilitate and direct correct intersubunit interactions, viruses can use host resources such as molecular chaperones and membrane-specific regions, or other viral components such as scaffolding, accessory, cement, and proteolytic proteins [3] . Due to their structural efficiency at the nanoscale, virus capsids are used in the laboratory extensively as protein cages to incorporate various types of materials at inner and/or outer capsid surfaces, or as nanocontainers to encapsulate proteins or other biomolecules with potential application in nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology [4, 5] .",

IBDV is a double-stranded (ds)RNA virus with a single, non-enveloped icosahedral capsid [6] . The CP VP2 is synthesized as a precursor form, pVP2, encoded as part of the NH 2 -pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH polyprotein (1012 residues). VP4 is a viral protease that cotranslationally cleaves its own N and C termini [7, 8] , and VP3 is a multifunctional protein with scaffold [9, 10] and dsRNA-binding [11] activities. pVP2 (512 residues) undergoes a series of VP4-mediated processing events at three secondary targets (residues 501, 494, and 487) [12] . The resulting pVP2 intermediates can be further cleaved by a host protease (residue 452), the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase PurSA [13] , and/or by VP2 itself (residue 441) [14] to yield mature VP2 and several C-terminal fragments ( figure 1(a) ).",

            "text": "Two general strategies are recognized for viral genome packaging mechanisms, (i) viruses that assemble a procapsid and require a nucleic acid (dsDNA) pump or portal, and (ii) those that form around their genome (mostly ssRNA). Most dsDNA viruses assemble a precursor particle, the procapsid, which subsequently expands to a mature capsid for genome packaging. Procapsid assembly requires scaffold proteins (SP), as well as a protease that cleaves SP and initiates expansion [3, 25] , and a nanomotor (incorporated at the onset of capsid assembly) that pumps DNA into the capsid by ATP hydrolysis [26] . The capsid thus withstands high pressure as the genome is pumped in. By contrast, most viruses with single-stranded (ss) genomes assemble spontaneously around their genomes, that is, assembly and packaging are coupled [27] . As recently visualized by cryo-EM with the bacteriophage MS2, most ssRNA is folded into stem-loops [28, 29] . Electrostatic interactions between positive charges on the CP inner surface and negative charges on ssRNA are the driving thermodynamic force for capsid assembly [30] . In general terms, the stiffness and high charge density of dsDNA (or dsRNA) genomes of certain length preclude spontaneous packaging, although relatively small dsDNA fragments can be packaged spontaneously, as is the case of Simian virus 40 [31] . Viruses that package a dsDNA genome into a preformed empty capsid appear to be stronger and more rigid than viral capsids that assemble around a ss genome [32, 33] .",

            "text": "IBDV capsid assembly is initiated with a precursor CP (pVP2) and a SP (VP3) to build a particle that resembles a procapsid-like structure. IBDV lacks a portal protein for genome translocation, and the genome is probably incorporated by VP3 (due to its RNA-binding activity) during early capsid assembly. Furthermore, IBDV dsRNA segments might be packed as positive ssRNA segments, as in other dsRNA viruses [34, 35] . VLP produced by IBDV polyprotein expression in an inducible recombinant vaccinia virus [24, 36] result in spontaneous assembly of T = 13 VLP, which were a mixture of empty VLP and VLP bearing nonspecific ssRNA (possibly cellular messengers) [37] . In this study, electrophoretic analysis in ethidium bromide-stained native agarose gels showed that HT-VP2-466 VLP produced with a rBV are mostly empty particles (or nucleic acid incorporation is minimal). This result indicates that, as anticipated, the His tag only emulates the SP function of the VP3 C terminus, but VP3 RNA-binding activity is entirely lost. At first glance, HT-VP2-466 VLP are a drawback for efficient packing of exogenous nucleic acids. These VLP nonetheless have advantages; they can be used to encapsulate a DNA fragment directly, as removal of nonspecific host nucleic acids is unnecessary. Here we show proof of concept for HT-VP2-466 assemblies as potential carriers of heterologous nucleic acids in their interior cargo space. Future experiments will define the packaging of other nucleic acids (ssDNA, ssRNA, dsRNA) and the size limits for each type.",

The simultaneous effect of these factors destabilizes VP2-mediated inter-trimeric interactions. In principle, these interactions could be restored by dialysis against the original buffer, but cleavage of the C-terminal \u03b15 helix in any pVP2 intermediate precursor precludes VP2 reassembly into T = 13 capsids or tubular structures. In contrast, HT-VP2-466 capsids and assemblies maintain the ability to establish the interactions necessary for building T = 13 capsids. After disassembly in TE buffer, dialysis against the original buffer in the absence of cargo leads to reassembly of these capsids and of other small particles. These experiments indicate a reversible process that assembles T = 13 capsids similar to those of IBDV. The development of an in vitro disassembly/reassembly system for HT-VP2-466 capsids allows the non-specific incorporation of macromolecules during reassembly. This system can be used to encapsidate, besides nucleic acids as described here, other proteins or organic molecules.",

(c) Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (0.1% SDS) of purified 1000 and 1800 bp DNA fragments (lane 1), and extracted fragments after disassembly of cargo-bearing reassembled HT-VP2-466 capsids (lane 2). Lane 3 is a control of disassembled IBDV virions bearing the two genomic 2.8 and 2.3 kbp dsRNA fragments. Bands were detected by ethidium bromide staining. (d) Scheme of the HT-VP2-466 assemblies analyzed in this study (1-4, as described above).",
