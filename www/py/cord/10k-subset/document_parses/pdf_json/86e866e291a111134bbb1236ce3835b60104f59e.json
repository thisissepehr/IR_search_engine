A significant number of patients are unable to tolerate the masks and eventually stop using their devices. The goal of this project is to develop custom-fit masks to increase comfort, decrease air leakage, and thereby improve patient compliance. A single-patient case study of a patient with variant ALS was performed to evaluate the custom-fit masks. His high nose bridge and overbite of lower jaw caused poor fit with generic masks, and he was noncompliant with his machine. Using desktop Stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, a generic mask was extended with a rigid interface such that it was complementary to the patient's unique facial contours. Patient or clinicians interactively select a desired mask shape using a newly developed computer program. Subsequently, a compliant silicone layer was applied to the rigid interface. Ten different custom-fit mask designs were made using computer-aided design software. Patient evaluated the comfort, extent of leakage, and satisfaction of each mask via a questionnaire. All custom-fit masks were rated higher than the standard mask except for two.

Although the mask was excellent for the first night, as the seven-night trial progresses, the leakage and discomfort became intolerable. A few of the mask features may be more effective than others in reducing leakage. Comparing masks 1 and 2, the contoured silicone layer of mask 1 reduced leakage more than contouring just the rigid interface. This may be because the silicone was not compliant enough and the addition of silicone to the contoured rigid interface resulted in constriction or changes in the overall mask contour. Masks 3 and 4 were designed with the same feature (silicone thinning and spreading outward) but with slightly different cross-sectional profiles. The leakage ratings for both were different, indicating that the resistance to leakage of this design concept is sensitive to the cross-sectional profile. We observed that thin silicone walls such as in masks 3-5 and fully compliant silicone design such as in mask 10 were unable to resist leakage against the pressure generated by the BiPAP machine. As masks 1, 6, and 7 did not show a difference in leakage, the rough interfacing may not be an effective feature. The feature that reduced air leakage the most was the double walled feature in mask 8. However, in the seven-night trial, the leakage rating for mask 8 went down.
