Furthermore, preexisting cross-reactive MBCs that recognized H3N2v HA were demonstrated for most subjects, and the level of these preexisting MBCs had a significant correlation with early anamnestic Ab responses against H3N2v in this small substudy. By day 21, this correlation was lost, perhaps because of a subsequent (slower) rise of primary Ab responses against new epitopes in H3N2v rHA. We also demonstrated that the frequencies of MBCs recognizing H3N2v rHA and rHA from 1 of 2 seasonal viruses tested increased after vaccination. Thus, vaccinated individuals appeared as a group quite capable of developing new MBCs to H3N2v, irrespective of prior exposure to seasonal vaccines or infection. Following vaccination, most subjects responded to H3N2v vaccine antigen, and the MBC pool expanded to include not only B cells recognizing seasonal H3N2 HA, but also newly generated H3N2v-specific cells that encoded Abs that do not recognize the HAs of previous seasonal H3N2 viruses. The frequency of preexisting MBCs observed here for seasonal antigens and the frequency of MBCs to H3N2v after vaccination are typical of the human response to IIVs. It was interesting that the frequency of MBCs to H3N2v vaccine antigen after vaccination did not correlate with the magnitude of serum Ab responses. Abs are secreted by plasma cells, especially by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow, whereas MBCs do not secrete Abs but participate in secondary responses following reexposure. In fact, recent clinical trials with avian IIVs revealed little serum Ab response following primary vaccination but a strong response after subsequent boosting at a late time point, suggesting primary vaccination induced MBCs independent of a detectable serum Ab response [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1896, "end": 1900, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The HA of H3N2v is more closely related to that of seasonal H3N2 viruses that circulated in the 1990s. Studies using animal antisera that cross-react with human H3N2 epidemic influenza virus strains used in recent seasonal influenza vaccines exhibited no cross-reactivity with the H3N2v strain. Furthermore, limited serologic studies indicate that young children have little to no preexisting Abs to H3N2v and that immunization of young children with seasonal trivalent IIV (IIV3) elicits minimal to no cross-reactive Abs. In one earlier study, younger adults had evidence of cross-reactive Ab (approximately one third of adults 18-49 years of age had a titer of \u226540 before seasonal IIV3 immunization), but few developed Ab responses to H3N2v after immunization with seasonal IIV3 (50% with a postvaccination titer of \u226540 against H3N2v) [9] . Older adults were shown to have a lower frequency of Ab to the variant before immunization with seasonal IIV3 than younger adults (17%), and 40% had putative protective titers after vaccination with seasonal IIV3 [9] . Low levels of cross-reactive Ab against H3N2v has been observed in several other studies, particularly among children and older adults [10, 21] , and IIV3 failed to increase seroprotection rates substantially in one of these [10] . IIVs made using current and recently circulating seasonal H3N2 strains from humans are therefore unlikely to confer significant protection against H3N2v infections. In the current study, both younger and older adults developed significant serum Ab responses following a single 15-\u03bcg dose of H3N2v vaccine. Responses among the younger subjects were greater than those among the older subjects. Higher preexisting Ab levels were positively correlated with higher postimmunization Ab levels, and the frequencies of significant titer rises were lower among those with higher preexisting Ab titers, as observed previously [22] . The geometric mean fold increase from day 8 to day 21 among older subjects was greater than that among younger subjects, consistent with a delayed Ab response, which has been observed by others [23] . While 1 dose of vaccine containing 15 \u03bcg of H3N2v HA was immunogenic in adults, children and persons with underlying medical conditions that could impair their immune responses may need different immunization regimens. For the A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine, 2 doses containing the age-appropriate HA dose were needed for children <9 years of age [24] , and while vaccines containing 15 \u03bcg of HA were immunogenic in persons \u22659 years old, high-dose vaccines containing 60 \u03bcg of HA elicited superior Ab responses among adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus [25] . High-dose seasonal IIV is available for use in persons who are \u226565 years old and stimulates Ab responses that are superior to those stimulated by standard-dose IIV [26] . High-dose vaccines have been shown to be more efficacious than standard-dose vaccines in elderly individuals [27] . Additional studies will be needed to define immunization needs for these and other vulnerable populations.
