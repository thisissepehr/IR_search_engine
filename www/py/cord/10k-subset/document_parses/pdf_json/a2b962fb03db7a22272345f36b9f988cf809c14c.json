UL39 encodes the HSV large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. We aligned 85 full-length HSV-2 UL39 sequences, including present and prior NGS data [14] [15] [16] , Genbank, and in-house resequencing. The maximum nucleotide distance was 0.0183. Length varied from 1,141 to 1,146 AA/3,423 to 3,438 nucleotides (SI Table 2 ). Relative to the commonest 1,444 AA length in strain 186, strains SD90e 15 had identical 3 AA deletions, strain HG52 had a 2 AA deletion, and Ugandan strain D39650 14 had a 2 AA insertion. Indels were in the UL39 N-terminus. HSV-1 UL39 sequences (n = 82, Genbank) were each 1,137 AA long and had lower 0.006 aximum nucleotide distance. HSV-1 17+ 17 was used for further analyses. We constructed UL39 phylogenetic trees from HSV-2, HSV-1 17+ , and the ChHV homolog. Across the entire gene, the larger of the two major branches (SI Fig. 2 ) contained HSV-2 SD90e and laboratory strain 186. These data support the recent suggestion 15, 18 to use SD90e as the prototype HSV-2 strain, rather than strain HG52 (see below), and we named the largest UL39 group SD90e/186. We did use strain 186 rather than SD90e for recombination analyses herein, because strain SD90e has a very rare 9 nucleotide deletion in UL39 (above), while overall 81/85 strains (95%), including strain 186 had the same, prevalent length for UL39. Laboratory strain HG52 clearly fell in the minor UL39 branch. HSV-1 and ChHV segregated outside of these major HSV-2 groups, with ChHV closer to HSV-2 than HSV-1 from HSV-2. Aside from low prevalence SNPs and short indels, we noticed that the prevalent differences between UL39 sequences were concentrated in the 3\u2032 region of the ORF. We therefore re-analyzed from base pair (bp) 950 to the stop codon ( Fig. 1) to focus on the divergent region. To simplify, we present data for the 26 HSV-2 unique sequences in this region, excluding identical sequences. The HSV-2 SD90e/186 group was again the largest. The minor group now resolved more clearly into two subgroups. One subgroup, designated HG52, included 8 of 85 strains (9.4% of total). The second subgroup contained 15 of 85 (17.6%) sequences and was designated G19080 (SI Table 1 ) after a representative member. G19080 was isolated from a 45 year old HIV-1 co-infected US woman (Genbank KR135308 14 ) .

We used a ddPCR assay (loci schematized in Fig. 2 ) to rapidly genotype additional samples (Supplementary Methods, SI Table 4 for methods; sample data in SI Fig. 1 ). Strains HSV-1 17+ , HSV-2 G19080, HSV-2 HG52, and HSV-2 186 had the predicted HSV1:HSV1, HSV1:HSV1, HSV2:HSV1, and HSV2:HSV2 genotypes at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UL39 loci respectively. Most swab-derived DNA specimens had one of these genotype patterns. A new HSV1:HSV2 ddPCR pattern, consistent with additional UL39 IRV, was detected in in two HIV-uninfected participants (samples 2010_29297 and 2008_35742) ( Fig. 2 , SI Fig. 1 ). For participant 5060 who donated sample 2010_29297, 11 swabs collected over 37 days had this ddPCR genotype. Sanger sequencing (SI tables 5 and 6) confirmed the ddPCR data and defined two additional UL39 IRV genotypes. Each had 3\u2032 crossover markers identical to G19080 (SI Table 3 , Fig. 2A ) and novel 5\u2032 crossovers internal to the long G19080 HSV-1 insert. Sample 2008_35742 had a longer HSV-1 insert than sample 2010_29297, containing 11 additional HSV-1 type-specific allelic variant markers and extending a minimum of 77 bp further in the 5\u2032 direction within UL39. Bootscan, Simplot and phylogenetic analyses again were highly consistent with recombination (SI Fig. 3 ).

Taken together, the most parsimonious explanation for both the common HG52 group and these rare, short HSV-1 UL39 fragments is an ancestral long recombination event giving rise to G19080, followed by back-recombination events wherein a part of the HSV-1 fragment in G19080 was expelled by recombination with a 186-like HSV-2 strain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 266, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 337, "end": 343, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 412, "end": 419, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 451, "end": 457, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 862, "end": 868, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 874, "end": 880, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1164, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1174, "text": "Fig. 2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1556, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "We noted additional unique sequences in the C-terminal UL39 phylogeny (Fig. 1 ).

A rectal swab from a HIV-infected Peruvian man, R-103-1010 had multiple C-terminal heterozygous UL39 loci detected by NGS, manual sequencing of bulk UL39 PCR product, and clonal analysis of amplicons cloned from PCR product (SI Fig. 2 , Supplementary Table 6 ). The pattern indicated a simultaneous, dual HSV-2 SD90e-group and G19080-group infection pattern. UL39 bulk PCR amplicon sequencing of 10 additional swabs collected over a 14 day genital HSV-2 outbreak were also each heterozygous, indicating a prolonged episode of simultaneous dual-strain infection. Separately, we found that HIV un-infected North America participant 11848 had either a pure SD90e group-or a pure G19080-group UL39 ddPCR pattern in swab DNA samples collected 4 years apart (SI Table 6 ), consistent with dual strain infection but not simultaneous reactivation. UL29 genes with HSV-1 \u00d7 HSV-2 specimen 5073_9333, using target capture to enrich HSV DNA (Greninger et al. in preparation), and obtained sequence essentially identical to HSV-2v (SI Table 6 ). We found HSV-2v in 9 (6%) of 146 persons using a ddPCR assay data (SI Table 4 ). These included 6 of 49 Eastern or Southern African, 1 of 46 North American, and 2 of 51 South American subjects. HIV co-infection was present in 7 persons, but absent in one Ugandan, and in the US subject. The American participants with HSV-2v UL30 had the G19080 HSV-1 UL39 insert, while each African had the SD90e group UL39 gene. Burrel et al. proposed that HSV-2v UL30 resulted from HSV-2-ChHV recombination 5 . We aligned full length UL30 from HSV-1 (n = 98), ChHV 22 , HSV-2v, HSV-2 NGS sequences [13] [14] [15] [16] , laboratory strains, and HSV-2 sequences in Genbank. HSV-1 UL30 were closely related, with maximum pairwise uncorrected nucleotide distance of 0.01 and little C-terminal variation. HSV-1 17+ and HSV-2 186 were chosen as the species genotypes for recombination analyses for consistency with our analyses of UL39. For both UL30 and UL29, strains 186 and the proposed prototype strain SD90e were extremely similar. We noted that most HSV-2 UL30 sequences have a 539 bp zone of identity to HSV-1 (Table 2, Fig. 4C ). This zone contains over 70 consecutive HSV-1-specific allelic SNPs and an HSV-1-specific 12 bp insert. Lateral to this zone, all HSV-2 UL30 genes, including HSV-2v, are similar, and quite dissimilar from HSV-1 (Fig. 4D) . Contravening the ChHV hypothesis, many SNPs and a 3 bp indel in the 539 bp region separate HSV-2v from ChHV. Bootscan (Fig. 4D) confirmed a HSV-1 \u00d7 HSV-2 crossover event with highly shifting bootstrap values supporting different phylogenetic topologies. Simplot analysis further supported recombination by significant shifts in sequence similarity. Phylogenetic analyses of discrete regions of UL30 demarcated by the putative crossover zones associated with the tree clustering patterns (Fig. 4D) . The phi-statistics (p = 0.0) and RDP4 algorithms demonstrated high significance for recombination (p < 7.6 \u00d7 10 \u221218 for all methods).

The shorter recombination fragment in HSV-2 strain HG52 suggests a back recombination, where a strain with the larger HSV-1 recombination fragment has recombined again with another HSV-2 strain and expelled a part of the recombinant fragment.
