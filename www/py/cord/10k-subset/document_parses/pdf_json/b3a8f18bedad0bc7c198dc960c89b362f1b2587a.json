The majority of these proteins are distantly related to papain or chymotrypsin and may be direct descendants of primordial proteolytic enzymes. Virus genome synthesis and expression, virion formation, virion entry into the host cell, as well as cellular architecture and functioning can be under the control of viral cysteine proteinases during infection. RNA virus proteinases mediate their liberation from giant multidomain precursors in which they tend to occupy conserved positions. These proteinases possess a narrow substrate specificity, can cleave in cis and in trans, and may also have additional, nonproteolytic functions. The mechanisms of catalysis, substrate recognition and RNA binding were highlighted by the recent analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases of two RNA viruses.",

            "text": "After the introduction of genetic engineering methods in RNA virus research, fulllength cDNA clones that can be used to generate infectious transcripts in vitro have been developed for the majority of the (+)RNA virus family prototypes. Numerous RNA viral genomes have been sequenced and analyzed. 3C pr\u00b0 was shown to be conserved in the polyproteins of picornaviruses and, surprisingly, also in plant como-, nepo-and potyviruses. In these viruses, the enzyme is a member of an array of conserved replicative domains [41] [42] [43] . Proteolytic activity was detected in 3C-containing polypeptides of different picorna-and related viruses. Furthermore, the PV 3CD protein, a precursor of 3C pr\u00b0 and the 3D RNA polymerase (3DP\u00b0~), rather than 3C pr\u00b0 itself was shown to be the major enzyme involved in processing of the capsid protein precursor P1 [44, 45] . The narrow substrate specificity of 3C pr\u00b0 became evident by the discovery that nine out of 12 available Q/G dipeptides in the PV potyprotein were cleaved by this enzyme [46] . The 3C p~\u00b0 of other picornaviruses and the 3C-like (3CL) proteinases of related plant viruses have a similar but more relaxed specificity. Only one conserved cysteine residue, thought to be the catalytic nucleophile, was identified in 3C p~\u00b0 sequences of different origin [41, 47] and its indispensability for the PV 3C pr\u00b0 proteolytic activity was proven by site-directed mutagenesis [48] . A local sequence similarity was noticed around the principal catalytic residue of 3C pr\u00b0 and cellular serine proteases of the chymotrypsin-like (CHL) family rather than cysteine proteases of the papain-like (PL) family [47] . This initial observation was further extended by modeling of the CHL double ~-barrel fold and the prediction of the active site organization in the viral enzymes [49, 50] . The basic features of these models have gained support from a site-directed mutagenesis study of the potyvirus tobacco etch virus (TEV) 3CL or\u00b0, Nuclear Inclusion a (NIa) protein [51] .",

It was shown to be conserved in entero-and rhinoviruses but not in other viruses [49; Table 1 ]. 2A pr\u00b0 cleaves a pair of Y/G dipeptides in the PV polyprotein in cis and in trans, respectively [46, 53] . This enzyme was also implicated in the proteolytic inactivation of cellular cap-binding factor elF4G (former p220) in infected cells [54] . Proteolytic activity has also been assigned to the C-terminal domain of the nsP2 protein of the animal alphavirus Sindbis virus (SinV) [55, 56] and to the Helper Component (HC) of TEV [57] . Both proteinases were proposed to be distant relatives of cellular PL proteases, nsP2 is the major proteinase of alphaviruses mediating three cleavages in the nonstructural polyprotein (see below). In contrast, the cis-acting HC vr\u00b0 cleaves only one site consisting of a pair of glycine residues which separate HC and the downstream domain [58] .

It is a rather unusual proteinase with no apparent relatives among other proteolytic enzymes [62] . The cysteine proteinase v-cath of two baculoviruses, nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Bombyx mori (BmNPV) and Autographia californiea multiple NPV (AcMNPV), shares more than 30% of identical residues with some of the cellular PL proteases [65, 66] . The NPV v-cath is encoded between the 78.7 and 79.4 map units of the genome and consists of 323 amino acids (aa). This proteinase is also conserved in other baculoviruses.",

The enzymes can play an indirect role, mediating the production of an active viral factor, or a direct role, being intimately involved in one of these processes. The SinV nsP2 was found to control the switch from negative (-) strand to genomic RNA synthesis. It directs the proteolytic processing of the nsP1234 polyprotein following one of two alternative pathways. This leads to the production of a replicative complex that generates either (+) or (-) RNA [89] . 2A pr\u00b0 of different entero-and rhinoviruses stimulated the translation of different constructions which was driven by the cognate Y-non-translated region (NTR) of viral RNA [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . The stimulation did not require the assistance of other viral proteins. A proteolytically competent 2A p'\u00b0 was also required for wild-type level of the PV RNA replication [95] [96] [97] [98] . This activity of 2A pr\u00b0 was claimed to be unrelated to its role in polyprotein processing and in trans-activation of translation [95, 98] . Also, another picornavirns proteinase, 3CD pr\u00b0 (3cPr\u00b0), has been implicated in RNA replication. This proteinase seems to be a component of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex involved in (+)RNA synthesis [9%104] . Evidence has also been presented for an additional, as yet unidentified, role of the TEV HC pr\u00b0 in genome replication [105] . Another, 3CL, proteinase of TEV regulates its cellular localization by cleaving the 6K/NIa bond. The mature form of the proteinase, the NIa protein, is associated with cytoplasmic structures, whereas the 6K-NIa covalent complex is transported to the nucleus [t06].",

The translational switch from a cap-dependent to a cap-independent mechanism, which is used by entero-and rhinoviruses, employs 2AV% In aphthoviruses, L vr\u00b0 seems to play a comparable role. These proteinases cleave cap-binding eIF4G into two parts and, in this manner, they contribute to the inactivation of cellular mRNA translation [109] [110] [111] . 2A pr\u00b0 may also be responsible for the inhibition of cellular replication and RNA-potymerase (pol) II-dependent transcription which was observed in PV-infected cells. Both processes were reduced profoundly upon the transient expression of 2A pr\u00b0 in monkey cells [112] . Furthermore, the PV 3C p~\u00b0 appears to assist 2A p~\u00b0 in the control of polII-directed transcription and may be responsible for the inhibition of polIII-mediated RNA synthesis. 3C p~\u00b0 is involved in the modification of polIII Transcription Factor IIIC (TFIIIC) [113] and also cleaves the TATA-Binding Protein (TBP), which is the DNA-binding component of polII Transcription Factor IID (TFIID) [114, 115] . In FMDV-infected cells the inhibition of cellular transcription seems to be mediated by L vr\u00b0. This proteinase induces the Nterminal truncation of histone H3 in several test systems, although the cleavage was not reproduced upon incubation of purified substrate with the enzyme [1 t6,117] . In addition to biosynthetic processes, some picornaviruses, including entero-and rhinoviruses, affect cell architecture late in infection. The PV 3C pr\u00b0 or 3CD p~\u00b0 may be involved in this process since they can cleave Microtubule-Associated Protein 4 (MAP-4) into products detected in PV-infected cells [118] .",

            "text": "One of the remarkable features of viral cysteine proteinases is their ability to function in cis, in a monomolecular reaction. All CHL cysteine proteinases and a fraction of the PL proteinases, represented by the alphavirus nsP2, the FMDV L pr\u00b0 and the MHV PL p~\u00b0, are thought to cleave both in cis and in trans. The potyvirus HC vr\u00b0 and many recently identified PL proteinases, e.g. those encoded by corona-and arterivirus genomes, seem to act exclusively in cis. Several lines of evidence, albeit indirect, for the cis-activity of these proteinases were presented. Cleavage by nsP2 of the SinV nsPl/ns]~2 site, but not of the nsP2/nsP3 junction, was fast and insensitive to dilution [56] . Upon in vitro transla- tion of a number of viral RNAs, some cleavages were so fast that precursor proteins could only be observed upon processing inhibition [ 19, 20, 23, 69, 122] . However, it remained possible that two precursor molecules could be tightly associated and rapidly cleave each other, in an inter-rather than intramolecular fashion. To discriminate between these two possibilities, a system was employed in which a fraction of the molecules carried a defective proteinase and served as substrate for trans-cleavage by the same kind of molecules carrying an active proteinase. When tested in this way, the arterivirus and tymovirus PL proteinases did not show the intermolecutar activity mentioned above, although the cleavage site in the molecule containing the active proteinase was cleaved efficiently [20, 29, 69] . For many other proteinases, including the FMDV L pr\u00b0 and the PV 2A pr\u00b0, which demonstrated intermolecular activity in addition to apparent intramolecular activity, these two types of activities could also be differentiated. The processing mediated by these proteinases in cis and in trans responded differently to probing of the proteinase or the cleavage site structure by point mutations [8,122,123a] .",

            "text": "The prototype cleavage sites recognized by the PV 3C pr\u00b0 and the TEV HC pr\u00b0 are Q/G and G/G, respectively (see the Introduction). Variations of these sites dominate over others in the natural substrates of the majority of recently characterized proteinases [31, 33, 69, 72, [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] . The residues at either the P1 or the PI' position, or sometimes at both positions, can vary to different extents in substrates of viral proteinases (Fig. 3) . In addition to P1 and PI', other positions around the scissile bond may also be occupied by conserved residues [135, 148, 149] . Natural substrates bearing point mutations and peptide substrates of different structure were used to define the cleavage site determinants for a number of proteinases. The minimal peptide that was cleaved efficiently by the HRV-14 3C pr\u00b0 consisted of six amino acid residues, the scissile bond being located between the fourth and fifth residues. The optimal substrate for the proteinase was a symmetrical 16- met [150] . To be cleaved in the context of a potyprotein, a potential substrate should be accessible to the proteinase [151] . Peptides corresponding to a variety of natural cleavage sites were cleaved by the HRV-14 and HAV 3C p~\u00b0 with different efficiencies, which correctly reflected the kinetics of the respective cleavages observed in the respective polyproteins [128, 150] . Substrates containing primary cleavage sites were processed most efficiently by 3C proteinases; the structure of these substrates most resembled that of the prototypical sites. For the different residues surrounding the cleavage sites, a good correlation between conservation and intolerance to substitutions was observed. Elegant genetic experiments with PV confirmed that the principal cleavage site determinants for 3C p~\u00b0 occupy the P4, P1, and PI' positions of the substrate [152, 153] . In other viruses that employ 3CL proteinases, the substrate specificity is sometimes determined by other positions, which however always include the PI residue [ 12,13a, 150] . In contrast, in substrates recognized by the PV 2A pr\u00b0, P2 and PI' are the most important positions [123a,127] . In substrates cleaved by two different PL proteinases, the alphavirus nsP2 and the coronavirus PL1 p~\u00b0, P2 and P1 were shown to be determinants of specificity [135, 137, 139] . An interesting observation was made with respect to the primary structure of the only known site cleaved by the HepCV NS2-3 proteinase. Although the structure of this site is highly conserved in the different strains of HepCV, this conservation does not seem to be related to the recognition of this site by the proteinase [147a] . Variations in the structure of different cleavage sites recognized by the same proteinase, along with other factors (see above), probably provide an effective mechanism to direct limited proteolysis of polyproteins in a certain order and at a desired rate. Although optimal for its biological role, the structure of a natural substrate may differ from that of the site which is cleaved most efficiently by its cognate proteinase. This conclusion was drawn from the observation that heterotogous peptide substrates were processed by the HRV-14 and MV 3C vr\u00b0 with efficiencies that were comparable to or even higher than those observed for the corresponding authentic sites [129, 150] .",

Furthermore, 3C pr\u00b0 serves as an inhibitor for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of 3D p\u00b0i [154, 155] . The 3CD precursor was shown to be slowly autoconverted into 3C pr\u00b0 and 3D p\u00b0l and this process was efficiently stimulated by 3AB molecules [156] . It remains to be shown that 3C pr\u00b0 or 3D v\u00b01 (or both) interact with 3AB. The 3CL proteinases of other animal and plant viruses may be involved in protein-protein interactions similar to those described for the PV 3C pr\u00b0 [125, 145, 157, 158] . The PV and HRV-14 3CD p~\u00b0 (3C pr\u00b0) proteins also possess RNA-binding properties. The cloverleaf structure, which is conserved within the first 100 nucleotides of the 5'-NTR of the viral RNAs, was recognized by these proteinases [99] [100] [101] [102] . This interaction is crucial for the formation of the RNP complex that is implicated in (+)RNA synthesis (see above).",

            "text": "Catalytic system Viral cysteine proteinases employ different catalytic systems which seem to be original variants of the well-known catalytic triads identified in cellular enzymes. The HRV-14 and HAV 3C p~\u00b0 contain a triad of residues which are spatially equivalent to the catalytic Set-His-Asp of cellular CHL proteases and which are embedded in similar folds. In both enzymes the catalytic serine is replaced by cysteine and, in addition, in the HRV-14 3C pr\u00b0 the catalytic aspartic acid has been substituted by glutamic acid [5, 13] . The catalytic Cys 146, His 4\u00b0, and Glu 71 of the HRV-14 3C pr\u00b0 are in reasonable positions and orientations to form a charge-relay system that is similar, but not identical, to that of serine proteases. In particular, Glu 71 adopts an unusual antilone conformation to fit a space occupied by the smaller aspartic acid residue in serine proteases. The oxyanion hole involved in the stabilization of the tetrahedral transition complex is shifted 1-1.2 A away in the cysteine proteinase. Surprisingly, different active site organization was revealed for the HAV 3C p~\u00b0. The side chain of Asp 84, which is the counterpart of HRV-14 3C pr\u00b0 Glu 71, was shown to be oriented away from the catalytic histidine. Thus the HAV 3C vr\u00b0 likely employs a diad rather than a triad of catalytic residues [13,60] (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "The Cys-His-Asp(Glu) triad together with the glycine residue that follows the catalytic cysteine are the only conserved residues in the primary structures of 2A and 3CL proteinases [166] (Fig. 3) . The involvement of the cysteine in catalysis was supported by the results of inhibitor studies with numerous proteinases. Moreover, the formation of thiohemiacetal between the HAV 3C vr\u00b0 and a peptide-aldehyde inhibitor was recently demonstrated [167] . The importance of the triad residues for proteolytic activity of the CHL proteinases of different picorna-, como-, nepo-, calici, poty-, and coronaviruses was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, some Cys-to-Ser proteinase mutants retained partial [7, 14, 16, 67, 122, 168, 169] or even full [146] activity and acquired sensitivity to serine proteinase inhibitors [168] . The latter supported the genuine character of the relationship between cysteine and serine proteinases of the CHL family. In the same way, it was demonstrated that in a number of proteases glutamic acid and aspartic acid are (partly) interchangeable at the third position in the catalytic triad [7, 16, 101, [169] [170] [171] . The special character of this interchangeability is underscored by the observations that proteolytic activity was much more sensitive to replacement of the catalytic acidic residue by asparagine or glutamine [7, 14, 16, 100, [169] [170] [171] [172] . The only apparent exception was reported for coronavirus 3CL proteinases. A putative active site aspartic acid (glutamic acid) was tolerant to substitution by glutamine in the IBV and by alanine or proline in the MHV 3CL proteinases [67,173a] . In the human coronavirus 229E (HCV) an asparagine is present at this position [77] (Fig. 3) , and replacement of this residue by glycine or proline did not impair proteolytic activity in a peptide cleavage assay (J. Ziebuhr, G. Heusipp and S.G. Siddell, personal communication). These results and those of the James group [13] raise questions on the possible role(s) of the acidic residue in catalysis, and the possibility exists that viral CHL proteinases may differ in this respect.",

In line with this observation, a catalytic Cys-His diad of the PL type was identified in these and other viral PL proteinases by comparative sequence analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. At the primary structure level, the similarity between viral and cellular PL proteases is concentrated mainly around the catalytic cysteine residue; this is also true for the group of viral PL proteinases by itself (Fig. 3) . No apparent counterpart of the papain Ash 175 residue, which is considered to be the third member of the catalytic triad in some models, was recognized in any of the RNA-virus-encoded proteinases. Furthermore, another hallmark of cellular PL proteases -a tryptophane residue following the catalytic cysteine -is substituted in many viral proteinases by other aromatic or aliphatic residues, or even by arginine [23,28--30,33] (Fig. 3) . Unlike the observations made for CHL proteinases (see above), the Cys-to-Ser mutants of all viral PL proteinases tested thus far were completely inactive [9, 19, 20, 26, [28] [29] [30] 33, 69] .

His 16\u00b0 and Thr I41 of the HRV-14 3C vr\u00b0 were found to form the S1 subsite of the substrate-binding pocket and are hydrogen-bonded to the carboxamide group of the conserved glutamine residue in a 6-aa peptide substrate. The latter was modeled on the tertiary structure of the enzyme, a process that was guided by the organization of trypsin and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor complex [5] . The threonine and histidine residues of the substrate-binding pocket are conserved in the 3CL proteinases of most, but not all, viruses [49, 50] . There is a perfect correlation between the presence of the substrate-binding pocket histidine in 3C1 pr\u00b0 and the ability of the proteinase to cleave after a glutamine or glutamic acid residue (Fig. 3) . Substitution of. this histidine_ residue was absolutely deleterious for any of the 3CL proteinases under any of the experimental conditions tested [7, 48, 100, 104, 141, 142, 175, 176] . A similar observation was made for the nepovirus 3CL proteinases, in which a leucine occupies the position in the substrate-binding pocket that is normally occupied by histidine (Fig. 3) . Reversion of this leucine residue back to histidine inactivated the proteinase [143, 146] . The substrate-binding pocket threonine tolerated a conservative serine substitution fairly well and was sensitive to another substitution [104, 175, 176] . A PV Thr~4Z-to-Ser mutant gave a viable small-plaque progeny [104] . Interestingly, a viral serine rather than a cysteine enzyme with structural and functional characteristics of a 3CL proteinase was recently described for arteriviruses [141] (Figs. 1C and 2 ). In the HRV-14 3C pr\u00b0, the residue that could determine its specificity for a small residue in the PI' position was not identified. The $5-$2 subsites of the substrate-binding pocket, which interact with the less conserved P5-P2 positions of the cleavage sites, were recognized in the enzyme-substrate model of the HRV-14 3C pr\u00b0 as well [5] .",

Two sets of residues which might mediate such an activity have already been identified. The first set includes residues which could be changed to generate suppressor mutations for substitutions made in a region of the 5'-NTR. This region lies downstream of the cloverleaf structure and promotes cap-independent translation of viral RNA. The mutated residues are scattered in the polypeptide chain with a possible spatial concentration in two distinct areas far from the active site region of 2A pr\u00b0 [92] . These areas were implicated in the interaction with this region of the 5'-NTR [92] . The second set is represented by a finger-like motif CXC-Xn-CXH which was implicated in Zn 2+ binding [160,164a] . The spatial organization of the finger may distantly resemble that of the RNAbinding surface of 3CP% There is, however, a difference between the two apparently analogous structures. Unlike the 3C pr\u00b0 residues involved in RNA binding, the fingerforming residues of 2A pr\u00b0 cannot be mutated without the loss of proteolytic activity [160] because of their apparent role in maintaining the structural integrity of 2A p~\u00b0 [164a]. Interestingly, a structurally similar finger seems to be conserved in the HepCV NS2-3 proteinase (A.E. Gorbalenya, unpublished data) and replacements in it diminished the proteotytic activity of this proteinase as well [25] .",

All (+)RNA viruses of verte-brates and a significant number of plant RNA viruses employ cysteine proteinases or their serine homologues to control virus-specific processes and to modify the host cell. Proteinases can act in cis and/or trans and may display additional, nonproteolytic protein-and RNA-binding activities. The inactivation of proteinases is deleterious for virus reproduction and this makes these enzymes attractive targets for the therapy of many hazardous virus infections. The coding sequences for a large number of proteinases have been cloned, sequenced, and analyzed, and a few picornavirus enzymes were characterized in more detail. Extensive variations of only two structural themes, characteristic of the cellular enzymes chymotrypsin and papain, were identified in viral cysteine proteinases. This structural conservation, together with the narrow and conserved specificity of viral proteinases, will allow the development of general approaches to design anti-proteinase drugs to be used against a variety of viruses. Also, substances which interfere with nonproteolytic activities of viral proteinases could be developed. To accomplish these goals, the structure function relationships of viral proteinases (and their precursors) and the proteolytically active complexes which they form should be analyzed in detail for prototypes of all major groups of viruses.",

The figure presents examples of polyproteins of which the processing has been shown to be mediated by cysteine proteinases. These polyproteins are encoded by members of the picornavirus-like supergroup (A), the alphavirus-like supergroup (B) and the coronavirus-like supergroup (nidoviruses) (C). Only the proteolytic and a number of other well-conserved domains are indicated. The names of most, but not all, virus proteins are highlighted. The dotted lines connect homologous domains in the polyproteins of two members of a particular supergroup, which are conserved in the same order in all other viruses of the same supergroup (array of conserved domains). The homologue of the defective PL proteinase domain of the EAV nspl protein was demonstrated to be active proteinase in two other arteriviruses, PRRSV and LDV. In these viruses, two proteins nsplc~ (N-terminal) and nspl[3 (C-terminal) are produced instead of nspl. The approximate position of the nspl~nspl[~ cleavage site of PRRSV/LDV is indicated within EAV nspl. Proteolytic activity was not yet demonstrated tbr the MHV PL2 p~\u00b0, Furthermore, the MHV PL1 pr\u00b0 is not conserved in another coronavirus, IBV. The cleavage site maps of EAV and MHV are partly provisional.",

An alignment of the regions containing the active site residues and the dipeptides cleaved by each proteinase are shown, In addition, the amino acid sequences of chymotrypsin, the 3C-like serine proteinase of EAV (nSlM) and papain were included for comparative purposes. The distances to the N-and C-terminal ends of the proteinases and between the conserved regions are indicated. For the HepCV NS2-3 proteinase, the distance to the PI' residue of the cognate cleavage site, which separates the NS2 and NS3 domains, rather than to the C-terminus of the enzyme is indicated. The proteinases were divided into three groups, separated by blank lines, according to the phylogenetic classification of the protein. Top block: CHL proteinases; middle block: unclassified proteinases; bottom block: PL proteinases. The (putative) catalytic triad of the CHL proteinases and the HepCV NS2-3 proteinase as well as the catalytic diad of the PL proteinases and the EAV nsp2 proteinase are shown in bold and in a larger font and are indicated with *. The Sl substrate-binding pocket residues of the 3CL proteinases are depicted in bold italic. TomRSV: tomato ring spot virus; TBRV: tomato black ring virus.

A unique fold for this enzyme was revealed. The activating peptide residing far from the active site extends a [3-sheet of the enzyme core. In contradiction to the current model [63, 64] , which has been described in this review, Cys TM has been implicated in the thiol-disulphide exchange and activation, and Cys 122, in addition to His 54 and Gill 71, has been proposed to be part of the catalytic triad. This triad can be superimposed on the active site Cys-His-Asn residues of papain. The tertiary structure model of Ad 23K suggests that variants of a portion of the activating peptide may be useful for designing antivirus drugs.",
