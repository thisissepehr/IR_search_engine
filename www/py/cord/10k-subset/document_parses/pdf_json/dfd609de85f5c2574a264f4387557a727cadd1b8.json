The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person's lifetime. Case presentation: Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient's physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked. Conclusion: Exploring the patient's articular features in her clinical context led us to diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome, a complex and often ignored condition. The case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach and coordinated interventions to define and manage this clinical entity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Joint hypermobility (JH) is defined as the ability to move specific articular segments painlessly beyond the normal range. A localized JH may be seen in some professions [1] , or a generalized one which usually results from a congenital disease or acquired conditions. Whereas the latter is common among athletes [2] , congenital JH may be an indicator of potentially threatening connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) in particular, though most patients appear with no signs of further serious conditions. JH is a relatively common finding (from 10 to 30 % of children) [3] and present in addition to a wide range of subtle symptoms such as musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain, joint instability, fatigue or anxiety [4, 5] , but also cardiovascular autonomic diseases [6, 7] and bowel disturbance [8, 9] which are usually investigated and treated as distinct problems. JH and some of these features define the picture of the so-called joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS), a wide-spectrum clinical condition that is often hard to diagnose. It is a challenge to assess the frequency of JHS in the general population; the undefined signs, the lack of specific laboratory findings, but also the patients' difficulty in describing their symptoms make it easy to underestimate or overlook this clinical picture.
