Our aim was to evaluate the association of total and specific IgE, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophilia in HSCT recipients with pulmonary complications. We prospectively measured total and specific serum IgE, eosinophils, and ECP before and 28, 100, and 180 days after HSCT. We included 30 children (age 2-17 years) undergoing HSCT. Nine patients had a history of previous atopy without being associated with pulmonary complications after HSCT until day +360. Specific IgE levels showed a decline after HSCT, associated with the absence of allergy symptoms, suggesting a reduction of atopy. Elevated total serum IgE levels occurred in seven patients on day +28 after HSCT. This elevation did not coincide with allergy symptoms. ECP showed no correlation with total allergy symptoms, eosinophilia, IgE levels, or pulmonary complications. There was a significant correlation (p00.0367) between ECP levels on day +28 and concurrent acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Non-atopic serum ECP and IgE levels are elevated on day +28 after HSCT in children, with ECP showing a potential relation to acute GvHD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has emerged over the past decades as an important treatment option for several malignant and non-malignant diseases in childhood and adolescence. However, conditioning regimens are potentially limited by severe side effects contributing to significant morbidity and mortality rates. Of the patients, 40% to 60% experience infectious or non-infectious pulmonary complications, accounting for a significant percentage (24%) of transplant related deaths [27] during the first 3 months after transplantation [17] . Depending on whether they occur before or after day 100 posttransplantation, these complications are classified as early or late [13] . Historically, about 50% of all pneumonias observed after HSCT have been attributed to bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Risk factors for bacterial pneumonia include neutropenia and myeloablative therapy [8] . Non-infectious pulmonary complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) develop in 30-60% of HSCT patients [2, 23] . Conditioning regimen and graft type has been described to be contributing factors. Yet, the exact underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of these diseases remain unclear, which also makes appropriate treatment rather difficult [2, 13] . However, an association between lateonset non-infectious pulmonary complications (LONIPC) and chronic GvHD have been assumed [23] . Unfortunately, non-infectious lung pathology often responds poorly to standard therapeutic approaches [9] , hence identification of predisposing risk factors is crucial for the development of preventive strategies [17] . Previous studies have shown that eosinophil granulocytes and serum IgE are elevated after HSCT in adults. Although elevated eosinophil counts have been reported in adults with chronic GvHD, no correlation with outcome could be shown [4] . However, in adults with acute GvHD after HSCT, elevated eosinophils were associated with a better overall survival [19] . Frankovich et al. [12] have reported an association of asthma and atopic history and non-infectious pulmonary complications after autologous HSCT in pediatric Hodgkin patients [11] . However, no prospective studies in a pediatric cohort of allogeneic HSCT patients have been published as yet. The development of asthma after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been observed and described as a plausible phenomenon of transfer from donor to recipient [3, 15, 26] . Adjacent to the different cellular phenotypes, different clinical types of asthma are known, including non-atopic asthma. Some authors even call for regarding asthma as a syndrome rather than a disease because of heterogeneity in pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical symptoms, and response to treatment [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 509, "end": 513, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 698, "end": 702, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 914, "end": 917, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1035, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1039, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1272, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1276, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1516, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1629, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1868, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1990, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2015, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2173, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2466, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2470, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2474, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2784, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In cases of sibling donor grafts, we evaluated donors' atopic history within the interview before transplant.
