            "text": "Protein translation is essential for all forms of life. Within this process, aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (ARSs) play an important role. This highly conserved ubiquitously expressed class of enzymes is responsible for correct coupling of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, 1-3 which base pair with messenger RNA (mRNA) triplets. 4 This ensures incorporation of correct amino acids in the growing polypeptide chain during protein synthesis. Each proteinogenic amino acid is coupled to its corresponding tRNA by a specific ARS, 1 as reflected in the ARS nomenclature (for example IARS for isoleucine-tRNA synthetase; LARS for leucine-tRNA synthetase). Because protein translation takes place in both the cytosol and mitochondria, mammalian cells possess cytosolic and mitochondrial ARSs. Mitochondrial ARSs are encoded by separate nuclear genes (nomenclature: ARS2), with the exception of KARS, GARS, and QARS, which encode both the cytosolic and mitochondrial ARSs. 1 Over the past 15 years, an increasing proportion of ARS genes has been associated with human disease. In the first description, a heterozygous missense pathogenic variation in GARS was found to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D, a peripheral axonal neuropathy. 5 Subsequently, other dominant pathogenic variations in GARS, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] YARS, 17, 18 AARS, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] HARS, 25 KARS, 26 ",

Exomes were enriched using Agilent SureSelect XT Human All Exon kit V5 and sequenced on a HiSeq sequencing system (Illumina). Reads were aligned to hg19 using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Variants were called using Genome Analysis Toolkit variant caller and annotated, filtered, and prioritized using the Bench NGS Lab platform (Agilent-Cartagenia, Leuven, Belgium) and/or an in-house designed \"variant interface\" and manual curation. Patients were evaluated according to our clinical practice and all laboratory analyses were performed in ISO 9001/ISO15189 accredited diagnostic laboratories.

Potentially, all symptoms reported for cytosolic ARS deficiencies represent the spectrum of a common clinical phenotype. Conversely, some features might be characteristic for specific ARS deficiencies. Nine cytosolic ARSs (IARS, LARS, MARS, QARS, KARS, RARS, DARS, and EPRS) form a multisynthetase complex (MSC). The major role ascribed to the MSC is to improve translational efficiency. Putatively, pathogenic variations in this subset of ARSs result in common symptoms based on deficient MSC function. Alternatively, symptoms might relate to specific amino acids (individually or to groups like branched chain amino acids), based on abundancy in specific proteins or to common (non)canonical amino acid or ARS functions. Combined cytosolic and mitochondrial ARS deficiencies obviously represent a specific subgroup, with mitochondrial dysfunction reflected in laboratory findings, muscle biopsy, and affected organs with high oxidative metabolism (brain, heart). Similarly, sensorineural hearing impairment is frequently seen in other mitochondrial ARS deficiencies, including LARS2, HARS2, RARS2, 55 and IARS2. 54 However, anemia and hypoalbuminemia in our KARS deficient patient and hepatosplenomegaly during infancy in QARS deficiencies 46 might imply involvement of the cytosolic ARS deficiency. Conversely, although the multiorgan phenotype might suggest a mitochondriopathy, we did not find evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction caused directly by the cytosolic ARS deficiency.",

            "text": "Intrauterine growth restriction and failure to thrive seem closely related to a disease mechanism involving reduced aminoacylation activity, translational slowdown or inefficiency, and consequential decreased proliferation. Indeed, growth was diminished in complementation assays in yeast with mutant AARS, 31 IARS, 36 MARS, 34 GARS, 50 and KARS 53 alleles. Similarly, hypoalbuminemia would well align with this disease mechanism, because albumin synthesis is very sensitive to amino acid depletion, particularly for leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophane. 56 Moreover, organs most prominently affected in recessive ARS deficiencies are the organs with highest amino acid incorporation rates: liver (2.4%/hr), lung (1.0%/hr), brain (0.6%/hr), and muscle (0.4-0.7%/hr) 57 or high proliferation rates (intestine). This also concurs with the prominence of symptoms during perinatal growth and infections, periods of high translational demand. It remains unclear why other highly proliferative organs like the skin are not affected, except in one patient with IARS deficiency and skin hyperelasticity 37 and two sibs with QARS deficiency with a dry rough skin. 46 PAP was previously thought to be a specific feature of MARS deficiency. [33] [34] [35] We show that other recessive ARS deficiencies (IARS and LARS) can also cause PAP. Furthermore, our IARS deficient patient developed cystic abnormalities with time, as reported in YARS deficient patients. 38 PAP results from the accumulation of lipoproteins in pulmonary alveoli, leading to restrictive lung disease and respiratory failure. 58 Most commonly involved in the pathogenesis is defective granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor activation, either through GM-CSF autoantibodies 59 or rare pathogenic variations in GM-CSF receptor genes. 60 This leads to deficient alveolar macrophage maturation, which is essential for macrophages to clear and recycle surfactant. Interestingly, among patients with autoimmune antisynthetase syndromes, antibodies against ARSs strongly predict interstitial lung disease. 61 In addition, PAP is also a clinical characteristic of lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), a rare inherited metabolic disease 62 caused by a defective cationic amino acid transporter in the kidney, small bowel, lung, spleen, monocytes, and macrophages, resulting in leakage of cationic amino acids (arginine, ornithine, and lysine). Thus a shortage of amino acids, antibodies against ARSs, and genetic ARS deficiencies can all result in PAP, putatively through reduced aminoacylation and deficient translation to ensure adequate surfactant composition or homeostasis. Interestingly, LPI patients show considerable overlap in clinical phenotype with recessive ARS deficiencies, involving neurological impairment, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, PAP, renal tubulopathy, and hemophagocytic lymophohistiocytosis. 62 The fact that both reduced amino acid concentrations and ARS deficiencies can result in common clinical symptoms concurs with insufficient aminoacylation for efficient translation as disease mechanism.",

            "text": "If reduced aminoacylation leads to symptoms in patients with recessive ARS deficiencies and if patients have some residual enzyme activity, then supplementation of the corresponding amino acid or high protein intake might improve symptoms. This is in sharp contrast with the traditional management of replacing protein by glucose in patients with metabolic hepatic disease, but aligns with the previous advice to patients with LARS pathogenic variations 29, 30 to supply a minimum of 2.5 g/kg of whole protein either enterally or parenterally while unwell. This is supported by the restoration of growth upon increased intake with tube feeding in P1-3 (Fig. 2) . Similarly, the clinical phenotype in a patient with MARS deficiency improved after starting parenteral nutrition 33 and MARS aminoacylation activity and proliferation in yeast with mutant MARS alleles improved upon methionine supplementation. 34 In conclusion, through deep phenotyping of five patients with novel compound heterozygous IARS, LARS, KARS, and QARS pathogenic variations, we were able to add lung disease, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and renal tubulopathy to the common phenotype we derived from literature for cytosolic ARS deficiencies, involving CNS abnormalities, growth restriction, liver symptoms, and facial dysmorphisms. This highlights the importance of deep phenotyping in patients with novel rare genetic diseases. Identification of a common clinical phenotype implies that recessive pathogenic variations in newly identified cytosolic ARSs may result in similar clinical symptoms, which might improve disease recognition and guide diagnostic work-up. Insufficient aminoacylation activity to meet high translational demand as common disease mechanism would also guide therapeutic care. As some residual enzyme activity seems essential for life, adequate supply of protein/amino acids is crucial, especially during periods of increased translational demand, including the first year of life and infections.",
