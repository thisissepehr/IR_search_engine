There are many hypotheses explaining why this virus infection would be fatal. One of these is the impaired immune response of the infected patient. The use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors may cause decreased immune response and greater susceptibility to infections. We presented a case of a patient using adalimumab that have developed H1N1 without complications. This is the first case of H1N1 in a patient using adalimumab reported in Brazil. We discuss the possibility that anti-TNF may not predisposes to a serious form of the disease or fatal complications.",

Swine flu is a variant of the H1N1 virus whose transmission can occur through human contact with animals or contaminated objects and from man to man. This virus was originally called \"swine flu\" because laboratory tests showed that several of its genes were very similar to the influenza virus that usually affects pigs in North America. Further studies showed that many genes of this new virus were quite different from those that normally circulate in pigs from North America. H1N1 has two genes of influenza viruses circulating in pigs in Europe and Asia and also genes of avian and human influenza. Scientists call it \"the quadruple recombinant virus.\"",
