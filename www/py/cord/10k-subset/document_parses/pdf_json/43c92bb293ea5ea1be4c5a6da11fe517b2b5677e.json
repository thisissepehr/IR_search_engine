The data were collected via public domain; thus, neither ethical approval nor individual consent was applicable.

Hence, the [exp(\u03b1 2 ) -1] \u00d7 100% quantifies the percentage change, and \u03b2 2 quantifies the unit change (day) in the serial interval, namely change per day in the calendar date.

The Pearson correlation coefficient between the serial interval and calendar date is estimated at \u22120.37 (P < .01).

The contact tracing and timely isolation of confirmed COVID-19 infections could lead to shorter observed serial interval due to right censoring 'bias'. 6, 7 As such, we call the observed serial interval under the effects of control measures the effective serial interval, which has a mean of 5.2 days from our data set. This result appears slightly but not significantly shorter than the previous estimated 'intrinsic' serial interval, with a mean of 7.5 days. 1 The mechanism behind the gender difference remains unknown, but it may be partly due to the fact that male cases are more severe than female cases (ie, \"officials recorded a 2.8% fatality rate for male patients versus 1.7% for female patients\" 8 . In both panels, the red represents the female primary cases, and the blue represents the male primary cases. The dots are the observed (or median) serial interval, and the bars are the ranges of serial intervals for multiple primary cases.
