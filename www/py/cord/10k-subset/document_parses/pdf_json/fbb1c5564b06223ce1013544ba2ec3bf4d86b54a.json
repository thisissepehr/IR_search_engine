By using the block heterogeneous mean-field approach, a series of discrete-time dynamical models is formulated and the condition for epidemic outbreaks can be established which is shown to be not only dependent on the network structure but also closely related to the immunization control parameters. Results show that increasing the immunization strength can effectively raise the epidemic threshold, which is different from the predictions obtained through the susceptible-infected-susceptible network framework, where epidemic threshold is independent of the vaccination strength. Furthermore, a significant decrease of vaccine use to control the infectious disease is observed for the local vaccination strategy, which shows the promising applications of the local immunization programs to disease control while calls for accurate local information during the process of disease outbreak.

However, previous work mainly focused on the immunization over the whole population under the assumption that the vaccines supply is sufficient to cover the most of individuals at risk. In some special scenarios, especially for emerging diseases, the vaccine supply is small compared with the large amount of population size at risk. Therefore, it is pivotal to investigate a local immunization program that is confined to a specified subpopulation. In the current manuscript, the immunization strategies through contact tracing on the susceptible-infected-recovered framework in social networks are proposed. Using dynamic analysis and numerical simulations, the epidemic thresholds are found which are shown to be closely associated with the adjustable parameters for the vaccination programs. This result is different from the case for susceptible-infected-susceptible model framework where epidemic threshold is independent of the vaccination strength. Furthermore, a significant decrease of vaccine use to control the infectious disease, through comparison of static and dynamic immunization schemes, is observed for the local vaccination strategy. These results provide novel designs for disease control using immunization programs.",

Since an individual's vaccination decision is made mainly based on the epidemic seriousness while sometimes, the novel effective and safe vaccine can only be developed and mass-produced after the emergence of infectious diseases triggered by new pathogens, the dynamic immunization is always implemented in realistic situations in most cases. 1, 10 Similar to individual's behavioral responses to infectious diseases, 11, 12 the dynamic immunization can be welladjusted based on transmission information during the epidemic spreading. As soon as an infectious disease begins to spread in the population, an effective immunization program should be initiated which may be adjusted according to the disease prevalence and the program terminates when the disease dies out. Therefore, the epidemic information-based immunization allows us to take the advantage of the interplay between the immunization response and the epidemic spreading. Motivated by this idea, researchers have evaluated the efficacy of various dynamic immunization schemes by using network models with direct immunization [13] [14] [15] or other modelling approaches. For example, Shaban et al. 16 formulated real-time susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) vaccination models for contact tracing in a network with a specific degree distribution by a branching process approximation. Nian and Wang 17 proposed a strategy to immunize the neighbors of an infected node. Ruan et al. 10 studied an information-driven vaccination program and found that strengthening the information diffusion can reduce the final vaccination fraction. Wang et al. 18 investigated the interplay between information spreading and disease dynamics in an information-driven vaccination program. Jo and Baek 19 and Fu et al. 20 evaluated efficiencies of immunization schemes in the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networks, respectively. Zhang et al. 21 investigated the impact of subsidy policies on vaccination decisions under the voluntary vaccination. More recently, Takaguchi et al. 22 proposed an immunization strategy based on observer placement, which is shown to be very efficient for disease control in the clustering networks.",

However, in reality, the vaccine supply is limited compared with the large population size at risk, especially for those diseases triggered by novel pathogens. Furthermore, vaccines may deliver to only a partial population due to other economic or humanity constraints. Therefore, it becomes much more realistic to consider a local immunization program that only covers a specified subpopulation (denoted by X in what follows). 23 It becomes of interest to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of static as well as dynamic immunization schemes for this realistic situation. A recent paper 23 investigated the SIS epidemic model with local immunization program and showed that the condition of epidemic outbreak is not related to the immunization strength. The SIS modelling framework is well-accepted for describing infections, such as rotavirus and gonorrhea, which do not confer long-lasting immunity. However, a SIR framework is more suitable for infections such as measles, mumps, and chickenpox where individuals recover and confer lifelong immunity, which is the fundamental framework we will extend in the current paper with network structures. Furthermore, we are also interested in the comparison of predictions obtained from the immunization programs for these two network model frameworks.",

These high-risk nodes can be found through contact tracing theoretically. 16, 24, 25 However, in practice, it is not easy to locate all these high-risk nodes and there exists a discount rate. Hence, we introduce an adjustable parameter d, denoted as the tracing rate or immunization rate, to account the efficiency of tracing and immunizing these high-risk nodes. Suppose a susceptible node will get infected by one infectious neighbor with rate b. Then a susceptible node with s infected neighbors changes its state with the following probabilities: 19 P\u00f0S ! S\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 d\u00de s \u00f01 \u00c0 b\u00de s ;",

All simulations are implemented by a parallel updating strategy in which the actual disease states of each node and its neighbors at each time step are considered. We start with a single initial infectious seed and all simulation results are obtained by taking averages of 20 random network configurations and 50 independent initial conditions for each network realization. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the epidemic prevalence R 1 (i.e., the fraction of recovered nodes at the end of the epidemic wave) as a function of infection rate b. This figure also shows the existence of an epidemic threshold for different immunization rates. In order to examine the validation of the theoretical results to the Monte Carlo simulation, we also consider the maximal infection density I max for different parameters, which has been shown to be an effective index to measure the epidemic threshold of the model with infinite absorbing states. 33 An alternative approach is based on the variability measure suggested by Shu et al. 42 As illustrated in Fig. 2(b) , the simulation results agree with the theoretical threshold conditions obtained in Eq. (5). Similar conclusion can be made for the targeted immunization in Fig. 3 . Furthermore, increasing d value can always raise the epidemic threshold s c regardless of the random or targeted immunization case. This result is significantly different from the SVIS network model based on an SIS framework (see detailed analysis about SVIS model in the Appendix), where the parameter d does not play a role for s c .",

Fig. 4 clearly shows that the immunization efficiency index Q is strongly correlated with the infection rate b and the immunization rate d for different predefined sets X, representing the random/targeted immunization strategies used. For each fixed d value, Q increases as b decreases. However, the monotonicity of Q, as a function of d is much more complicated, as shown in Fig. 4(a) for the random immunization case. Generally speaking, Q is an increasing function of d (Figs. 4(b)-4(d) ). However, in Fig. 4(a) , when the infection rate b is relatively small, say b \u00bc 0.2, the immunization efficiency is negatively correlated to the immunization strength, as highlighted by three blue lines. It is due to the dual effect of the increased immunization strength. 23 Although increasing d enlarges vaccination coverage, it also halts the spreading of an epidemic with a small infection rate across hub nodes and hence decreases propensity for vaccination. The relationship between s c and d is illustrated by dashed lines in each panel of Fig. 4 . Almost all of these curves lie in the red region, showing that the immunization efficiency should be very high to control the disease. It is noticed that at the case d \u00bc 1, the expression of s c is reduced to be the same as the corresponding static immunization in Ref. 38 . However, the spreading patterns between dynamic and static immunization are not the same, as many susceptible nodes are not vaccinated in X for the dynamic immunization.",

            "text": "The study of the network theory enables us to analyze the role of each node or node set in the epidemic spreading and get novel insights into the transmission dynamics. As we know, the SIR-like epidemic network model can be analyzed by various approaches, such as the percolation theory, 43 the branching process approximation, 16 and the effective degree approaches. 32, 44 Recently, the heterogeneous mean-field approach poses a good tool to analyze complex disease dynamics due to its simple and deterministic formulation. 18, 28 In this manuscript, we formulated real-time immunization models with the discrete-time HMF approach, where susceptible nodes can get immunized by contact tracing from infected nodes. Considering the real situations of vaccine shortages such that the number of vaccines cannot cover the whole population, we propose a local immunization program that can only immunize a given node set X in the whole population, which can be defined as a geological region of a city or a social group of a population or other groups sharing some characteristics. The epidemic thresholds for different (local versus global) vaccination scenarios against infectious diseases are obtained from stability analysis, based on which the effectiveness of a vaccination program can be evaluated. The predicted thresholds are validated through numerical simulations. Our result suggests that the local immunization program can greatly improve the efficiency of static immunization, requiring a smaller amount of vaccines to effectively control disease spread. However, the efficacy of vaccination programs not only depends on immunization rate but also on the choice of individual group to immunize. Therefore, it remains pivotal to extend the approach in this manuscript to other local immunization strategies, with different targeted vaccination groups to get an optimal strategy for disease control. This may contribute toward the optimal strategy of vaccine allocation for emerging infectious diseases such as influenza A (H1N1). 45 In the local immunization program with a SIR framework, we find that the immunization rate d can greatly affect the epidemic threshold, which distinguishes from the prediction based on the SIS spreading mechanism where d does not play a role in the threshold. This adds one more difference between the SIS and SIR network models, as revealed by Castellano and Pastor-Satorras 46 that the threshold of generic epidemic models is vanishing for an SIS model, while it is finite for the SIR model on quenched scale-rich networks (i.e., a > 3).",
