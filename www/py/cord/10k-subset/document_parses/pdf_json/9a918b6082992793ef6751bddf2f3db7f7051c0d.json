It has been estimated that virtually all children have had at least one RSV infection by their second birthday. RSV is responsible for annual disease outbreaks, usually during a defined winter seasonal period that can vary by community and year. RSV is recognized as the leading cause of hospitalization among young children worldwide. Infants of young chronologic age and children with predisposing factors, such as premature birth, pulmonary disease, or congenital heart disease, are most susceptible to serious illness. Unlike other viruses, immunity to RSV infection is incomplete and short lived, and reinfection is common throughout life. Initial attempts to develop a vaccine in the 1960s met with unexpected and tragic results; many children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated wild-type virus developed serious pulmonary disease upon subsequent natural infection. Numerous other vaccine technologies have since been studied, including vectored approaches, virus-like particles, DNA vaccines, and live attenuated virus vaccine. As of early 2010, only two companies or institutions had RSV vaccine candidates in early clinical trials, and no vaccine is likely to be licensed for marketing in the immediate future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization of infants and children in the United States 1-6 where it accounts for up to 120,000 hospitalizations annually in infants <12 months of age. 4, 7, 8 On a broader scale, RSV is the most common cause of childhood acute lower respiratory tract infection. 9 Costs associated with RSV-related hospitalization and outpatient visits for bronchiolitis are on the rise. 10, 11 The unique ability of RSV to evade maternal antibodies and infect infants very early in life increases the clinical impact of disease, due in part to narrow airways in infants that are susceptible to obstruction and an immature immune system in these children. In some cases, the clinical consequences of RSV-related illness do not end in childhood. Long-term studies of children hospitalized with RSV-related lower respiratory tract illness before age 24 months who were prospectively followed up for periods ranging from 18 to 25 years indicate that severe illness in early life is an independent risk factor for wheezing throughout childhood.

sneezing. 18 They named the virus that they cultured from the nasal secretions \"chimpanzee coryza agent\" (CCA) and were successful in inducing the same illness in nonimmune animals. A laboratory worker at WRAIR coincidently developed similar cold symptoms and CCA antibody titers. A year later, Chanock and associates recovered a CCA-like virus in an infant with bronchiolitis and in another infant with pneumonia. 19,20 Laboratory studies indicated that this virus was indistinguishable from the one isolated in the original report by Blount et al. 18 Sera from a group of infants who developed viral lower respiratory tract infections over a 5-month period was subsequently evaluated and indicated that many of the children developed humoral immunity to the CCA-like viruses. Chanock was able to show that infected cells consisted of multinucleated giant cells circumscribed by large syncytia, and proposed \"respiratory syncytial virus\" as a more suitable name than CCA for this virus. He is credited with the identification of much of the early knowledge about the importance as RSV as a viral pathogen, as well as with the discovery and testing of the RSV formalininactivated vaccine. A number of reports soon surfaced about this newly identified virus and resultant illness in children. Beem and colleagues reviewed the characteristics of acute respiratory disease noted in 41 children infected with the CCA/ RSV virus during the winter of 1958-1959 in Chicago. 50 The most frequently observed clinical diagnoses were bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory illness; two deaths were noted in patients who tested positive for the virus. Isolation of RSV from patients occurred between the months of December and April and was detected with highest frequency in January and February. Prospective studies conducted by Chanock's group during the 1959-1960 winter season in Washington, DC, provided further evidence of RSV as a significant cause of lower respiratory illness in young children. 51,52 RSV was recovered from 57% of young infants with bronchiolitis or pneumonia during a 5-month period.

A better understanding of the immune response to RSV infection is clearly necessary to further vaccine research. 115 The primary targets for RSV vaccination are neonates and young infants. They have immature immune systems and may not be able to elicit a robust immune response following vaccination in the presence of maternally acquired antibody. Strategies traditionally employed to overcome this problem involve the administration of more than one vaccine dose and delay in vaccination until after 6 months of age. Neither of these approaches is ideal. In addition, the RSV vaccine must not interfere with the safety and efficacy of other routine childhood vaccines. Assuming all of these obstacles can be overcome, given the history of Lot 100, regulatory bodies may question the safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates for prevention of RSV disease especially if the technology chosen has not been previously validated in young children or if a maternal immunization strategy is considered.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "History of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and immunoprophylaxis milestones.Late 1970s, early 1980s Additional studies validate cotton rat model of RSV illness.

Yeung et al. evaluated serum IgG levels of premature and term infants and showed that mean serum concentrations ranged from 180 to 656 mg/dL in infants born at 24.5 to 35.5 weeks GA, to 757 to 1100 mg/dL in infants born at 37 to 40 weeks GA. 91 A high proportion of premature infants remain hypogammaglobulinemic at 6 months of age. 92 Brandenburg and associates measured the decline in maternal RSV-specific antibodies over a 6-month period in 45 healthy term infants. 93 Antibodies were detected in all infants at birth (geometric mean titer [GMT], 301), steadily declined over the first 3 months (GMT, 24), and were undetectable in the majority of infants at age 6 months.

Ochola and coworkers characterized the levels of RSV maternal antibodies and their decay rate in 635 newly delivered babies in a rural area of Kenya. 95 Nearly all children (97%) had detectable levels of maternal RSV IgG at birth; levels that declined rapidly thereafter.

The concentration of serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies necessary to provide resistance to infection in these early cotton rat studies was similar to the level of maternally derived serum antibodies present in human infants <2 months of age. Both of these findings help explain later results obtained during human clinical trials of RSV-IGIV and RSV monoclonal antibodies for prophylaxis against serious lower respiratory tract disease following RSV infection. Results from these early studies provided evidence that the cotton rat is the best animal model of those tested for studying RSV infection and antibody response thus far. Limitations of this model include the fact that cotton rats do not develop measurable clinical disease and cannot, at present, be utilized to model cellular immunity. RSV is unique among respiratory viruses in that it infects infants at an early age, and those affected do not develop sufficient immunity to prevent subsequent reinfection. It is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year in the United States. There are no vaccines currently available for prevention of serious RSV illness, and none are likely to be licensed in the near future. Immunoprophylactic treatment with polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations against RSV has been developed to prevent RSV infection and reduce subsequent morbidity. In the second part of this series we will discuss the clinical history of immunoprophylaxis with antibodies in infants and children at high risk for serious RSV disease.
