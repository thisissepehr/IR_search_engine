Although there have been extensive studies of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, animal models and the immunobiology of infection, there is not yet a convincing and safe vaccine available. The major histopathologic characteristics of RSV infection are acute bronchiolitis, mucosal and submucosal edema, and luminal occlusion by cellular debris of sloughed epithelial cells mixed with macrophages, strands of fibrin, and some mucin. There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often co-circulate, but usually one subtype predominates. In temperate climates, RSV infections reflect a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter. It is believed that most children will experience at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. There are several key animal models of RSV. These include a model in mice and, more importantly, a bovine model; the latter reflects distinct similarity to the human disease. Importantly, the prevalence of asthma is significantly higher amongst children who are hospitalized with RSV in infancy or early childhood. However, there have been only limited investigations of candidate genes that have the potential to explain this increase in susceptibility. An atopic predisposition appears to predispose to subsequent development of asthma and it is likely that subsequent development of asthma is secondary to the pathogenic inflammatory response involving cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors. Numerous approaches to the development of RSV vaccines are being evaluated, as are the use of newer antiviral agents to mitigate disease. There is also significant attention being placed on the potential impact of co-infection and defining the natural history of RSV. Clearly, more research is required to define the relationships between RSV bronchiolitis, other viral induced inflammatory responses, and asthma.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV, here RSV) was first isolated from chimpanzees in 1956 [1] and was subsequently recovered from infants with severe lower respiratory tract disease [2] . It is a non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae. Its 10 genes encode 11 proteins since two overlapping open reading frames in the M2 mRNA yield two distinct matrix proteins, M2-1 and M2-2. The viral envelope contains three proteins, the G glycoprotein, the fusion (F) glycoprotein, and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein. The G protein functions in host cell attachment and the F protein is responsible for fusion and cell entry, whereas the SH protein is not required in either of these processes. The RSV virus comprises five other structural proteins, the large (L) protein, nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), and M2-1, and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Whether M2-2 also is a component of the mature assembled virus particles is currently unknown (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1087, "end": 1095, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often cocirculate, but generally one of the subtypes predominates [3, 4] . The results of molecular analyses show that several genotypes are present simultaneously in any given season and region, but even in neighboring regions, the circulating strains may differ [5, 6] . In temperate regions, RSV infections show a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter, a peak between mid-December and early February, and season offset in late spring (Fig. 2) . Some areas, in particular in northern Europe, report yearly alternations between an early large outbreak and a late small outbreak. In tropical regions, the patterns are less predictable and can include two yearly peaks in spring and fall or fairly constant infection rates throughout the year. Humans are the only host for RSV, and the reasons for the near disappearance of RSV between epidemics remain unclear. Following each epidemic, mean titers of maternally derived RSV neutralizing antibodies were found to decline in consecutively hospitalized infants <6 months of age and to reach their nadir shortly before the peak of the following epidemic in Denmark [7] . This led to the hypothesis that a cyclic pattern in the level of protective RSV-specific antibodies makes a major contribution to the seasonal pattern of RSV infections in temperate climates. It is more difficult to envision how this could account for the occurrence of two yearly RSV epidemics, as has been reported from Taiwan [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 170, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 171, "end": 173, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 365, "end": 368, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 369, "end": 371, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1238, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1573, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 561, "end": 569, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Epidemiology"}, {"text": "It is generally believed that most children will have experienced at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years.

During their first year of life, 68 % of the infants experienced a RSV infection; by the end of the second year, almost all children had been infected with RSV at least once. However, active surveillance during a RSV epidemic revealed an attack rate of 29 % in infants from Rochester, NY, though 62 % of infants within infected families [10] , which is similar to the 32 % infection rate during the first year of life reported from a prospective study in the UK [11] . These rates also agree with the results of seroprevalence studies from Germany and Japan [12, 13] , even when taking into account that infants may not elaborate lasting antibody responses during primary infection [14] . In contrast, seroprevalence data from China support high rates of RSV infection during the first year of life [15] . An important determinant of the infection rate appears to be the severity of the RSV epidemic, which varies from 1 year to the next, and of course the extent of individual exposure [14, 16] .

The clinical manifestations range from mild upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) or otitis media to severe and potentially life-threatening lower respiratory tract involvement (LRTI). The most common form of LRTI in RSV-infected infants is bronchiolitis, but pneumonia and croup are also seen. Involvement of the lower airways occurs in \u223c15-50 % of infants and young children with primary RSV infection and necessitates hospitalization in 1-3 % of the annual birth cohort, with infants between 2 and 6 months of age being at the highest risk [9-11, 14, 18, 19] . However, in some regions, the highest incidence of LRTI is reported in infants aged 6-11 months or even children between 1 and 2 years of age [20, 21] . In \u223c5-10 % of hospitalized infants, the disease is severe enough to require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Deaths are rare in previously healthy infants born in industrialized countries, but mortality rates are significantly higher in infants and children in developing countries and in patients with preexisting cardiac or lung disease or other chronic conditions [8, 21, 22] . Reinfections with RSV are observed in 30-75 % of children <2 years of age who had experienced a RSV infection during their first 12 months of life and usually occurs during the following season [9, 14] . The rate of reinfection again depends on the strength of the epidemic [14] . Even in secondary infections, the disease is usually symptomatic in young children, but its severity steadily diminishes with subsequent exposures, with fewer children experiencing bronchiolitis or other lower respiratory illness, fever, and middle-ear effusions [14] . Reinfections remain common throughout life, but in older children and adults, symptoms are generally either absent or confined to the upper respiratory tract, with LRTI (tracheobronchitis, bronchitis, wheezing) being observed in approximately one fourth of symptomatic illnesses [23] . However, immunocompromised patients, those with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, and the frail and elderly are also at risk of severe lower respiratory tract involvement, and RSV constitutes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in these populations [24] [25] [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 697, "end": 715, "text": "[9-11, 14, 18, 19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 860, "end": 864, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 865, "end": 868, "text": "21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1252, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1256, "text": "21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1260, "text": "22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1460, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1461, "end": 1464, "text": "14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1541, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1811, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2097, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2363, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2368, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2373, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis"}, {"text": "The most common manifestation of RSV LRTI is bronchiolitis, but there is no general agreement on the definition of this entity.

Fever may be present, but high fever is uncommon. Apnea may be observed in very young and premature infants. These clinical signs are accompanied by wheeze and/or fine inspiratory crackles on auscultation. While North America and some parts of Europe place major emphasis on the presence of wheezing, widespread crepitations are considered to be the hallmark of bronchiolitis in the UK, Australia and other parts of Europe (while wheezing alone would be diagnosed as viral-induced wheeze).

Note that many epidemiological studies, particularly from developing countries, now follow the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to refer to any RSV LRTI as pneumonia, since bronchiolitis and pneumonia are difficult to distinguish clinically or radiographically. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, bacteriological testing may also be helpful, but its routine use is not indicated since the risk of serious bacterial infections is low in infants with bronchiolitis, even if they are febrile [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . The likelihood of bacterial infection becomes higher in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [34, 35] . Pulse oximetry is recommended for all patients presenting at the emergency department, although experts disagree on whether supplemental oxygen should be instituted at oxygen saturation of \u226492 or <90 %.

Another analysis yielded rates of 48.9 for infants 0-2 months of age, 28.4 for infants aged 3-5 months, and 13.4 for 6-11 month-old infants for the period 1997-2006 [46] .

The overall frequency for 1994-1997 was 178/1,000, which declined to 104/1,000 for 2001-2004, largely due to a reduction in RSV hospitalizations in premature high-risk infants after the introduction of palivizumab prophylaxis.

Approximately 45-85 % of RSV hospitalizations carry a discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis [51] [52] [53] , with some of the highest proportions coming from recent US surveillance and hospital discharge data [42] [43] [44] . Conversely, between \u223c50 and 80 % of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis are due to RSV (see also Table 2 ) [51] . More specifically, a virus is detected by (RT)-PCR in \u223c75-95 % of infants \u22642 years of age who are hospitalized with bronchiolitis, and RSV accounts for \u223c70-75 % of the viruspositive samples [39, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] (see also Table 2 ). Interestingly, the proportion of RSV does not vary markedly n.a. not available a This is the overall bronchiolitis proportion for the study population, which included children up to 5 years of age, but almost 80 % were <1 year old b The rate was 0.8 % in years with small epidemics, and 1.4 % in years with large epidemics c Is likely to represent an underestimate because not all hospitals have the ability to do antigen detection or viral culture regardless of whether sampling is performed for several years [57] , a single whole year [54] , or one or more RSV seasons only [39, 55, 56] . This clearly illustrates that RSV is the most frequent cause of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis, but it also underscores that other viruses can cause bronchiolitis, including rhinovirus, hMPV, corona, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, bocavirus and AdV [39, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59] . The proportion with a discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis is similar in patients with RSV, hMPV or rhinovirus infections [52, 60] . However, the overall hospitalization rates for these viruses generally are significantly lower compared to RSV-associated disease in infants <1 year of age, although some data suggest that picornaviruses, including rhinovirus, are the most common etiological agent in acute respiratory illness requiring hospitalization even in this population [61] . It should be noted that, while RSV generally remains the most frequent viral agent in LRTI and particularly bronchiolitis severe enough to require hospitalizations, rhinovirus is emerging as the most frequent cause of acute respiratory illness in general and LRTI in particular in prospective community-based studies from Wisconsin, Western Australia, and the UK [17, 41, 62] .

In ambulatory subjects with a first episode of RSV infection, there was no significant difference in viral load between patients with bronchiolitis and those experiencing only URTI [11] . In contrast, the results from another prospectively followed birth cohort indicate a moderate correlation between viral load and disease severity in patients infected with RSV alone, but not in those coinfected with another respiratory virus [103] . However, the authors point out that the viral loads in these outpatient episodes were similar to those they had previously found in infants hospitalized with severe RSV LRTI, indicating that viral load is not the only factor determining disease severity. In a community-based surveillance study from Indonesia, viral load was associated with disease severity in children \u22651 year of age, but not in infants, even though children <1 year of age had higher viral loads and generally had more severe disease than older children [104] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 187, "text": "[101,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "102]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 805, "end": 810, "text": "[103]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1342, "text": "[104]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Load"}, {"text": "Several investigations showed RSV subtype A to be associated with more severe disease compared to subtype B, and this risk persisted after adjusting for age, prematurity, and other risk factors [3, 4, 75, 105]. Conversely, a greater severity in subtype B compared with subtype A infections has only been reported in one study [106] . To add to the confusion, other studies were unable to detect a significant association at all [98, 107, 108]. Clade or genotype may be a more important determinant of disease severity than subtype [5, 106, 109-111], although a significant association with genotype is not consistently seen either [112] . These discrepancies are likely due to the fact that several different strains generally co-circulate in any given RSV season [5, 6] , and some of the studies may simply lack the statistical power to detect significant differences in disease severity between individual RSV genotypes. The results from a recent in vitro study in primary epithelial cells (ECs) and an epithelial cell lines suggest that prototypic RSV-A and RSV-B strains differ in their ability to induce nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation, an important step in the cascade of events leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the subsequent induction of the NF-\u03baB responsive genes IL6 and IL8, with RSV-B eliciting significantly lower responses compared to RSV-A [113] . This supports the finding of greater disease severity in subtype A compared to subtype B infections. Studies in cell culture and in vivo models also provide clear evidence that individual RSV type A isolates differ substantially in their infectivity, virulence, and immunopathogenicity [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] .

Several analyses show simultaneous infection with more than one respiratory virus to be associated with increased disease severity in infants [39, 60, 121-124], although this is not a consistent finding [53, 57] . In a Dutch communitybased study, viral load was significantly associated with disease severity when RSV was the only pathogen detected, but such an association was not evident in infants coinfected with RSV and another respiratory virus [103] . In this study, it was decided to designate the viral agent that was present in higher quantities as the primary pathogen. It remains to be determined, however, whether this is a valid assumption. As a matter of fact, a detailed analysis of clinical characteristics in co-infections compared to single infections showed RSV to dictate the prevalence and severity of clinical features such as obstructive airway disease and hypoxia as well as overall duration of hospitalization, regardless of whether the co-infection involved rhinovirus or adenovirus (AdV) [125] . Only the frequency of fever was significantly higher in RSV-AdV co-infections compared to RSV alone. In contrast, dual infections involving rhinovirus in combination with AdV or influenza virus more often yielded significant differences in the prevalence of individual clinical characteristics. This suggests that simultaneous detection of two or more viruses by RT-PCR is not simply the reflection of lingering viral nucleic acids from a past infection, but truly reflects the simultaneous presence of two (or more) pathogens. Other data suggest that the localization of the virus may also play a role. A substantial portion of nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from infants who required mechanical ventilation because of RSV bronchiolitis were found to contain hMPV RT-PCR products [126] .

There is considerable cause for concern over the high dose of dexamethasone that was used in this trial, and independent confirmation of the results should be obtained before adopting this approach. Also note that plasma cortisol levels were found to be significantly elevated in infants with mild bronchiolitis compared to healthy controls and were further elevated in patients with severe RSV bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization [129] .

Palivizumab is effective in these infants [141], but since this population comprises 3-5 % of the annual birth cohort the cost of indiscriminate treatment would be considerable. Consequently, there have been several attempts to develop models that predict which high-risk infants would benefit most from palivizumab prophylaxis [71, 149, 150] . In Canada, use of palivizumab according to the Canadian Risk-Scoring Tool [149] in infants with a GA of 32-35 weeks has been shown to be cost-effective [151] and convenient [152] .

This is at least partly due to the fact that RSV, like other viruses, has developed numerous mechanisms to evade or subvert the host immune response [155] (Fig. 3) . The G protein, which together with the F protein is the only RSV antigen inducing neutralizing antibodies, is heavily glycosylated, and this has been shown to interfere with antibody recognition [156, 157] . Another immune evasion mechanism involves the ability to produce the G protein not only in full-length membrane-bound, but also in a truncated secreted form (Fig. 1) . The secreted protein may act as a decoy for neutralizing antibodies [155] . In addition, the central conserved region of the G protein contains a CX3C motif, which endows it with the ability to signal through the CX3CR1 receptor and to exert chemotactic activity similar to that of fractalkine (CX3CL1). Whether this interferes or enhances leukocyte recruitment to the infected lung in vivo is unclear from the available data [158] . Sensitization of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the RSV G protein followed by RSV challenge activates primarily CD4+ T cells and results in the induction of eosinophilia in the context of a Th2-dominated immune response, whereas priming with the F protein activates both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induces mainly type 1 cytokines and lung inflammation [159] . Similarly, human RSV G protein-specific T-cell lines produce interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, whereas the cytokine profile of F protein-specific T-cell lines is Th1dominated and similar to that induced by live virus [160] . This implies that the RSV G protein has the potential to downregulate cellular immune responses. There are also data suggesting that the G protein can downregulate inflammatory responses by antagonizing signaling through tolllike receptors (TLRs) [155, 158] . In addition, RSV can infect dendritic cells (DCs), which results in their maturation, but nonetheless reduces their ability to present antigen and activate na\u00efve T cells, thus altering the cytokine milieu through a variety of mechanisms. These include failure to form an immune synapse between DCs and na\u00efve T cells, and the secretion of an inhibitory factor [161] .

It does not explain, however, why other researchers did not see a reduction in RSV-induced AHR after inhibition of IL-13 signaling or in IL-13-deficient mice, even though the strain they used greatly upregulated IL-13 levels in the lung [209] . This is particularly noteworthy since neutralization of IL-13 decreased the levels of IL-5 in BAL, increased the concentration of IL-12 and virtually abolished the increased mucus production seen after RSV infection. In similar experimental models, IL-5-dependent eosinophilia has been implicated in RSV-induced AHR [220].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 175, "text": "[245]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 352, "end": 357, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 358, "end": 363, "text": "[115]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 364, "end": 369, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 618, "end": 623, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 684, "end": 689, "text": "[246]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1097, "text": "200,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "247", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1347, "text": "[209]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IL-13"}, {"text": "The regulatory cytokine IL-10 is upregulated in the airways and lung parenchyma of RSV-infected mice [136, 248] .

Following infection of BALB/c mice with RSV, there is a rapid and dramatic increase in the absolute and relative numbers of Foxp3+ Tregs among CD4+ T cells in the airway, lung parenchyma and lungdraining lymph nodes [138, 217] . The results of three independent depletion experiments in BALB/c [138, 217] and hybrid CB6F1 mice [137] demonstrate that these Tregs play a vital role in regulating the recruitment of innate (NK cells and neutrophils) and, particularly in the later stages of the disease, of adaptive (T and B lymphocytes) immune cells. Whether this accelerates viral clearance is somewhat controversial. In addition, Tregs dampen the production of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines [137, 217], including the production of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 by virusspecific CTL [137, 138] , and control the trafficking of virus-specific CD8 T cells from the lymph node into the lung [138] . The results from the hybrid CB6F1 model further suggest that Tregs also play a role in moderating disparities in epitope dominance [137] . As a result, Tregs are central in diminishing disease severity, including overall morbidity and weight loss [137, 138, 217] . Interestingly, the depletion of Tregs in CB6F1 mice was associated with increased pulmonary levels of IL-10 [137], suggesting that IL-10 alone is not sufficient for suppression of the RSVinduced immunopathology and that the effects of IL-10 deficiency or IL-10R blockade are largely mediated by the failure to maintain adequate numbers of Tregs [136] . The anti-CD25 antibody that was used in these studies for depletion of Tregs also eliminates activated CD25+ T cells. \"Depletion of regulatory T cell\" mice allow the specific depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs. While weight loss was even more dramatic in these mice, the overall results were similar, with the notable difference that viral load was decreased in Treg depleted mice [139] . Conversely, increasing the number of Tregs via IL-2 immune complexes decreased inflammation and accelerated recovery.

Cells expressing CD56 (NK cells) were also detected only rarely in the nine cases with fatal RSV infection, and staining for granzyme was absent [291] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 95, "end": 100, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 444, "end": 449, "text": "[291]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 695, "end": 700, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 848, "end": 853, "text": "[291]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Histopathology"}, {"text": "Whereas animal studies clearly indicate a role for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells not only in viral clearance, but also in the lung immunopathology after RSV infection, the role of T lymphocytes in human disease is less clear. Several lines of evidence suggest that CD8 T cells do not play a major role in the immune pathology of RSV. Postmortem lung tissue obtained from infants (median age 3 months, range 1-12 months) who had died from severe RSV infection contained very few detectable CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CD56+ NK cells, or granzyme-positive cells [291] . In contrast, lung tissue from a child with ambulatory RSV infection showed evidence of a prominent CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltrate, particularly in the alveoli [171] . Together, these findings suggest not only that these cells do not participate in the damage of the bronchiolar epithelium typical of severe RSV infection, but also that an inadequate T cell response may underlie the development of severe fatal RSV LRTI. A marked increase in the CD8+ T cell count has been observed in NB-BAL of infants with severe, but non-fatal RSV infection, and these cells exhibit an activated phenotype, including significantly higher expression of granzyme B compared to controls [282] . However, the magnitude of the T cell response did not correlate with any measure of clinical disease severity. In addition, the T cell response in peripheral blood, whether detected by RSVspecific tetramer staining or by measuring the total activated T cell population, peaked at the time of extubation, i.e., during the recovery phase approximately 9-12 days after the onset of symptoms. A further study from the same institution confirmed these findings in another group of infants with severe RSV infection and extended them to the observation that peripheral blood CD8+ T cell responses peaked well after the peak viral load, which was maximal before or on the day of admission to the ICU, and also took place after the greatest symptom severity, which occurred 2-3 days after admission to the ICU [294] . Similarly, the concentrations and activity of granzyme A and B were significantly elevated in tracheal aspirates of RSV-infected patients compared to controls without pulmonary conditions [285] . However, there was no association between granzyme levels and a marker of epithelial apoptosis or markers of disease severity. Furthermore, the most severe disease is generally observed in very young infants, but infants \u22645 months of age were found to have RSVspecific cellular cytotoxic responses much less frequently compared to children 6-24 months of age (38 vs. 67 %) during acute RSV infection [295] . Of note, detectable responses arose only 7 days or more following infection, but waned again in the youngest infants, while many of the 6-24 month-old children exhibiting sustained responses 2-3 months after the acute infection.

There have been numerous investigations of the cytokine profile in airway secretions during acute RSV infections [11, 101, 267, 275, [305] [306] [307] [308] . Note, the concentrations of mediators in samples from the upper airways generally show moderate to strong correlations with those of specimens obtained simultaneously from the lower airways of mechanically ventilated infants [101, 308] .

These include leukotrienes (LTs) and products of eosinophil degranulation, such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). In particular ECP and EDN are detected at significantly higher levels and in a significantly higher proportion of patients with RSV compared to healthy controls [306, [317] [318] [319] . The levels of ECP were also significantly higher in infants and children with RSV bronchiolitis compared to those with LRTI without wheezing and lowest in those with URTI only and correlated with disease severity as measured by initial oxygen saturation [318] . Other investigators detected an association between IFN\u03b3 concentrations and levels of EDN [305] or leukotriene C4 levels [308] . This may reflect the ability of IFN\u03b3 to activate eosinophils and prolong their survival. Interestingly, peripheral eosinophil counts are reduced in the majority of studies [129, 320, 321] , but peripheral eosinophilia has also been reported [322, 323] . The frequent detection of high levels of products of eosinophil degranulation is particularly noteworthy given that eosinophils are rarely found in BAL fluid or nasopharyngeal samples or in postmortem lung tissue of RSV-infected infants [171, 276, 281 ].

Passively acquired maternal antibodies are detectable in essentially all neonates, though at greatly varying titers [89, 90] . Their levels decline with a half-life of \u223c26 days [89] in agreement with the half-lives of endogenous and exogenous IgG antibodies. The highest risk of RSV LRTI severe enough to require hospitalization is seen at an age (2-6 months) when maternal antibodies are still present. This not only shows that RSV can cause infection in the presence of maternal antibodies, but raises the question of whether maternal antibodies may actually enhance rather than prevent disease. There are, however, numerous studies showing that the titers of maternally derived neutralizing antibodies are inversely associated with RSV infection overall [91, 92] , or with the severity of RSV disease [16, [93] [94] [95] [96] . In addition, palivizumab prophylaxis substantially reduces the risk of hospitalization for RSV LRTI in highrisk infants [141, 142] . Nonetheless, the presence of maternal antibodies can further limit the already weak ability to mount antibody responses observed in infants [331, 334] , as confirmed through the use of passive antibodies in experimental animals [257] . The immaturity of the neonatal immune system also contributes to the suppression of an active serum and mucosal antibody response [331, 334] . For example, it has been shown that the postinfection IgA antibody response to the RSV F protein correlates with age, while preexisting maternally derived antibodies determine the magnitude of the IgA response to the G protein [331] . Consequently, clear (three-or fourfold) increases in serum and/or nasal wash concentrations of RSV G or F proteinspecific IgG and IgA are not seen in all infants after primary RSV infection [89, 328] .

It later became evident that preterm children were overrepresented in the case sample and that there were significant interactions between premature birth and 11 of the 347 SNPs under investigation, nine of which localized to genes coding for mediators of innate immunity [346] . Importantly, six of these SNPs showed associations with severe disease only in preterm children, with IL27, C3, NFKBIA and TGFBR1 being protective and IFNG and ADAM33 risk-enhancing. Whereas IL1RN (encoding the IL-1 receptor antagonist) was protective in the premature birth group, it augmented the risk of term children.

In vitro, RSV ligation of TLR4 on airway epithelial cell lines was shown to enhance viral entry and replication via MyD88-and p38 MAPK-dependent mechanisms, with the latter playing a role in intracellular viral trafficking and virion disassembly [348] . TLR4 was also found to mediate the in vitro response of macrophages to purified RSV F protein, but not G or N protein, in a CD14-dependent manner [349] . Studies in TLR4-deficient mice have yielded conflicting results, with some showing delayed viral clearance in association with decreased NK and CD14+ cell recruitment to the lung, deficient NK cell cytotoxicity and reduced numbers of IL-12 producing cells [350] , while others were unable to replicate any of these results [243] . The specific genetic background of the TLR4-deficient mice and the controls may have been a major reason for these discrepancies. In yet another TLR4-deficient mouse strain, TLR4 played a critical role in NF-\u03baB activation in the initial response to RSV infection, though not in the later phases [351] . Activation of this transcription factor is an essential step in the induction or upregulation of numerous cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. A subset of infants (8/26) with RSV bronchiolitis showed upregulation of TLR4 expression on peripheral blood monocytes; the procurement of samples a mean of 7.5 days after disease onset may have precluded the detection of such enhanced expression in a substantially larger proportion of patients [352] . In these eight infants, the levels of TLR4 expression correlated negatively with minimal oxygen saturation.

An association between disease severity and a haplotype with higher promoter activity agrees with studies showing an association between higher IL-8 protein levels in airway secretions of RSV-infected infants and increased disease severity [269-271]. In marked contrast, when comparing 101 Chinese children hospitalized with RSV-positive pneumonia to 108 children with RSV-negative pneumonia, the IL-8 \u2212251T allele was significantly associated with RSV pneumonia, as was the TT genotype and also the \u2212251T-781C haplotype in logistic regression analysis [383] . In a German population, no association between the \u2212251A/T or the 781 C/T SNPs and RSV bronchiolitis was detected at the allele, genotype or haplotype level [384] .

They obtained highly significant results for SNPs across the IL4 gene and its promoter, with rs2243250 (the promoter polymorphism \u2212589C/T) yielding the highest OR at the allele and genotype level in the subset of infants without known risk factors for severe RSV disease.

A causal association was suggested by the early findings of Th2-skewing (of the mitogen-stimulated PBMC response) during severe RSV disease, which is characteristic of atopic asthma [296, 297] . This was further supported by the discovery that a considerable portion of infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis develop virusspecific IgE and a variety of mediators implicated in asthma, including ECP, EDN, LTs, and histamine [264, 318, 325] . Furthermore, RSV-specific IgE and histamine were detected almost exclusively in patients with bronchiolitis [325] , although this was not confirmed in another study [326] . In addition, virus-specific IgE was found to be associated with the development of postbronchiolitic wheezing [429] . Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the elaboration of Th2 cytokines in response to RSV infection could promote the sensitization to inhalant allergens. Allergic sensitization usually occurs early in life and during a time that overlaps with the period of greatest risk for severe LRTI due to RSV. This would then promote atopic asthma, which is thought to be the most common form of childhood asthma in developing countries. Since the actual infection with RSV runs a self-limiting course of 1-2 weeks and RSV-specific memory responses are short-lived, this hypothesis often invokes recurrent RSV infections. This may not be necessary, however, since there is growing evidence that the immune response to RSV is not as short-lived as has long been assumed. For example, the proportions of PBMC expressing CD4, CD23 (low-affinity IgE receptor), and the activation marker CD25 were significantly increased 5 months after the bronchiolitis episode [321] . At the same time point, PBMC from subjects who wheezed produced more IL-4 in response to stimulation with house dust-mite antigen. Similarly, serum samples obtained during convalescence (10-153 days after presentation) from RSV infection were found to contain significantly elevated levels of soluble CD25 [430] . In RSV-infected mice, the levels of DCs remain elevated in the lung for at least 21 days after viral inoculation [229] [230] [231] [232] .

Other investigators do not detect eosinophilia [115, 246] or even find decreased levels of IL-5 after RSV infection alone [209] . Instead, some data strongly implicate IL-13 and its ability to induce mucus production in both the RSV-associated AHR and the RSV-induced enhancement of allergic airway sensitization [116, 246] . While the results discussed so far suggest that that the two processes share a common mechanism, the results from another model indicate that the two events proceed via different mechanisms [209] . Specifically, through the use of IL-13-deficient mice or IL-13 neutralizing antibodies, it was demonstrated that IL-13 did not play a role in the AHR seen after RSV infection alone, even though it was strongly induced by RSV infection. It was, however an important mediator of the RSV-induced enhancement of allergic airway responses. In yet other experiments, RSV infection before allergen sensitization actually decreased the production of IL-13 and lung eosinophilia compared to OVA sensitization and challenge in mock-infected mice and thereby attenuated allergen-induced AHR [236, 247] . While some of these discrepancies can be attributed to methodological differences, it has been demonstrated that some commonly used laboratory strains of RSV do not induce pulmonary IL-13 production and upregulate IL-10 instead [114] [115] [116] .

In one case, this concerned sensitization to food allergens at the age of 1 year, while sensitization to inhaled allergens is a more important risk factor for the development of atopic asthma [407] . In a cohort that included children who had experienced RSVpositive or RSV-negative bronchiolitis in infancy, the rate of SPT positivity to common aeroallergens was significantly higher in index cases compared to controls (29 % of index cases vs. 15 % of controls) at the 5-year follow-up [409] .

The same group of authors claim to have provided further evidence for a causal association by showing that the highest odds ratio of developing clinically significant bronchiolitis was seen in children who were 122 days old, and the highest risk of being diagnosed with high-risk childhood asthma was observed in children who were 121 days old, at the time of the winter virus peak [469] .

In contrast, none of the factors reflecting the severity of the initial RSV bronchiolitis episode, which required hospital care, were significantly associated with physician-diagnosed asthma in another cohort [471] . Monozygotic twin pairs discordant for RSV hospitalization in infancy (and, it is assumed, disease severity) were not found to differ in lung function, AHR, frequency of asthma diagnosis, or allergic sensitization at a mean age of 7.6 years [472] . In addition, when asked which of the twins had the more severe disease, the parents identified the non-hospitalized twin with similar frequency as the hospitalized twin. In other cases, both twins may have been hospitalized in the expectation that their disease would eventually be of similar severity, even though one may have been less severely affected. In a study of the association between RSV hospitalization and asthma in the same 5,154 Danish twin pairs that formed the patient basis for the preceding study, modeling of the direction of causation indicated that severe RSV infection did not cause asthma, but instead was an early indicator of a shared genetic predisposition for both asthma and severe RSV disease [473] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 376, "text": "[411]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 588, "end": 593, "text": "[471]", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 836, "end": 841, "text": "[472]", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1572, "text": "[473]", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Risk of Recurrent Wheezing and Asthma Depends on Disease Severity"}, {"text": "Many of the gene polymorphisms found to be associated with severe RSV disease have also been implicated in the genetic predisposition to asthma.

Therefore, only studies comparing the genetic associations with asthma and severe RSV disease in genetically rather homogeneous populations are likely to yield meaningful results. Such studies do not suggest that there is considerable overlap in the genetic susceptibility to asthma and severe RSV infection.

Levels of ECP were higher in infants and children with RSV bronchiolitis compared to those with LRTI without wheezing.Concentrations of IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, and MCP-1 were found to directly correlate with various measures of disease severity MCP-1 levels were inversely associated with the duration of supplemental oxygen requirement. RANTES (CCL5) Chemokines help to determine the degree of inflammation and the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate RSV-induced changes in airway physiological responses were significantly reduced after RANTES blockade in mice. RSV infection of airway epithelial cells in vitro stimulates upregulation of RANTES By recruiting specific leukocyte subsets, chemokines contribute to the determination of disease severity. In neonatally infected mice, virus-specific IgE plays a role in mediating enhanced AHR upon reinfection.In BRSV infected calves severity of experimental disease correlates with development of BRSV-specific IgE response [260, 497]. Low levels of RSV-IgE are detectable in the late stages of acute infection, with peak concentrations occurring~3 weeks after infection. RSV-infected mice produce RSV-specific serum IgM, followed by IgG, predominantly of the IgG2a isotype. Elevated concentrations of substance P in BAL and lung tissue of RSV-infected mice. Selective NK-1R antagonists can inhibit development of RSV-induced AHR if given prophylactically. Prophylactic blockade of NK-1R signaling was accompanied by reduced airway lymphocytic inflammation, and decreased airway hyperresponsiveness. Substance P plays a dual role in the development of AHR during acute RSV infection, namely proinflammatory and neurogenic. SP-A and SP-D can modulate TLR4 signaling downstream of TLR ligation, it could be shown that TLR stimulation in B cells is an essential step in eliciting protective, affinity-matured antibodies against RSV [258]. The role that TLRs play in this process probably hinges on their ability to induce DC maturation and T helper and B cell activation. Some experimental mice infected with RSV develop RSV-specific IgE antibodies [259], although this was not observed in a similar experimental system [254]. However, bRSV-infected calves also exhibit RSV-specific IgE [260]", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar fluid cellularity in RSV-infected infants", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Heidema [282] n=32 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Everard [281] 14 </td><td>McNamara [276] 24 Term </td><td>23 Preterm\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>6.3 (2-21 days) </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>5.7 </td><td>5.4\n</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of symptoms at the time of sampling\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Method </td><td>FACS </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Differential </td><td>Differential </td><td>Differential\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Granulocytes </td><td>Percentage </td><td>Absolute # (105/ml)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>76.4 </td><td>1.5-10.9 </td><td>85 [69-94] </td><td>76 </td><td>85.3 </td><td>78\n</td></tr><tr><td>Monocytes </td><td>25 </td><td>0.4-4.5 </td><td>not reported </td><td>10 </td><td>8 </td><td>12\n</td></tr><tr><td>Lymphocytes </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1.5 (range 0-5) </td><td>9 </td><td>6 </td><td>8\n</td></tr><tr><td>B cells </td><td>0.4 </td><td>0-0.5\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>NK cells </td><td>0.4 </td><td>0.1-0.6\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>CD3+ T cells </td><td>1.9 </td><td>0.3-5.9\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>CD4+ of CD3+ </td><td>28.1 </td><td>0.1-1.2\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>CD8+ of CD3+ </td><td>62.2 </td><td>0.2-3.0\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "Genes and polymorphisms associated with increased or protective effects on severe RSV infection", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "Gouyon JB, Roz\u00e9 JC, Guillermet-Fromentin C et al (2012) Hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in preterm infants at <33 weeks gestation without bronchopulmonary dysplasia: the CASTOR study.
