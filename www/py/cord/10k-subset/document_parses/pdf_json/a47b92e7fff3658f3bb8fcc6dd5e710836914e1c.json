            "text": "When confronted with a globally spreading epidemic, we seek efficient strategies for drug dissemination, creating a competition between supply and demand at a global scale. Propagating along similar networks, e.g., air-transportation, the spreading dynamics of the supply vs. the demand are, however, fundamentally different, with the pathogens driven by contagion dynamics, and the drugs by commodity flow. We show that these different dynamics lead to intrinsically distinct spreading patterns: while viruses spread homogeneously across all destinations, creating a concurrent global demand, commodity flow unavoidably leads to a highly uneven spread, in which selected nodes are rapidly supplied, while the majority remains deprived. Consequently, even under ideal conditions of extreme production and shipping capacities, due to the inherent heterogeneity of network-based commodity flow, efficient mitigation becomes practically unattainable, as homogeneous demand is met by highly heterogeneous supply. Therefore, we propose here a decentralized mitigation strategy, based on local production and dissemination of therapeutics, that, in effect, bypasses the existing distribution networks. Such decentralization is enabled thanks to the recent development of digitizable therapeutics, based on, e.g., short DNA sequences or printable chemical compounds, that can be distributed as digital sequence files and synthesized on location via DNA/3D printing technology. We test our decentralized mitigation under extremely challenging conditions, such as suppressed local production rates or low therapeutic efficacy, and find that thanks to its homogeneous nature, it consistently outperforms the centralized alternative, saving many more lives with significantly less resources.",

This bypasses the distribution networks, and allows a more leveled spread of the therapeutic. We consider the fact that such decentralization might, under some conditions, exhibit lower production capacity, if, for instance, the local synthesis is inefficient, or the therapeutic efficacy is sub-optimal. However, as we show that equality precedes capacity, we find that this strategy consistently prevails thanks to its egalitarian nature, even if inferior in many other relevant parameters, e.g., production rate, response time or therapeutic efficacy. Hence, the merits of decentralization overcome its potential practical shortcomings, calling on us to urgently develop decentralized mitigation capabilities.",

However, recent breakthroughs suggest that decentralized mitigation is limited by perception, rather than by technology. Indeed, certain types of therapeutics can be converted into digital information, handled and distributed as data, and then locally printed, i.e. synthesized, at their designated destination (Box 1, Section A). Such digital shipping of, e.g., DNA sequences, vaccines or therapeutic agents, is, already in use [16] [17] [18] , hence the relevant technology is, in fact, currently available. However, at present, this technology remains unscalable under global demand. We, therefore, continue to lack decentralized mitigation capabilities, a lacuna that is primarily driven by the current absence of motivation to scale-up our printing capacity, as indeed, the crucial advantages of decentralization are yet unrecognized. Following our analysis below, exposing the unequivocal merits of decentralized mitigation, we wish to prompt its development as a future response to global epidemics. This entails advancing the already existing technological pathways towards practical implementation at a global scale -a goal that, given the appropriate motivation, we believe is within our reach. In Section A we present specific guidelines for economically viable decentralized mitigation, showing that, under achievable reduction in costs, an annual investment of 50-500 USD per individual is sufficient to set up the required infrastructure within approximately one decade.",

This competition confronts us with several challenges: (i) the inevitable response time t R required for us to instigate a mitigation plan places the pathogen at a potentially significant spreading advantage; (ii) while the pathogen reproduces as it spreads 1-3 , a therapy must be manufactured and shipped from one or few sources, whose production capacity may be limited [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ; (iii) under global demand we must ship the therapeutics worldwide, stretching the bounds of our limited transportation resources.",

It would na\u00efvely seem that winning this competition relies on rapid production and shipping capacity. However, here we show that due to the different spreading dynamics -drug dissemination becomes intrinsically inefficient when faced with global demand. The source of this inefficiency is rooted, not in production/shipping rates, but rather in the fact that network-based commodity flow leads to an uneven, and hence highly ineffective, supply of the therapeutic. As a consequence, we show that for a sufficiently large network, even unrealistically optimistic production/shipping capacities remain insufficient.",

We used empirical data on human aviation to evaluate the flux of passengers between = N 1, 292 local populations (nodes), each with M n individuals ( = \u2026 n N 1, , ), and quantified the impact of the epidemic through its global coverage is the fraction of removed untreated individuals in n.

In this approach, the dissemination is limited by the source's distribution capacity C s (day \u22121 ), capturing the number of doses that can be shipped from s per day, as dictated both by s's manufacturing capabilities and by the carrying capacity of the global transportation network. Setting = C 1 s represents a scenario where s is capable of distributing sufficient supply to satisfy the global demand in a single day, i.e. produce and ship doses at a volume comparable to the entire global population.

However, the phenomenological analysis above indicates, that there is an intrinsic deficiency in the spread of therapeutics, that cannot be easily compensated by simply increasing production/shipping rates C s . Indeed, as we next show, the two competing processes -viruses vs. therapeutics -lead to fundamentally different spreading patterns, in which the viruses benefit from an intrinsic advantage. Viral spread. Viruses spread via diffusion coupled with local SIR dynamics as captured by Eq. (12), Fig. 4a . In this process, upon penetration, the viruses reproduce locally at each node n through SIR, until reaching peak infection at = t T n Peak, . In a random network, since the majority of nodes are at the mean distance from the initial outbreak, we find that they all reach peak infection approximately simultaneously. Therefore, after a limited propagation time, the infection levels become almost homogeneous across all nodes, creating a uniformly distributed demand of the therapeutic. Indeed, we find that during the global peak infection, T peak , the infection distribution P(j) is bounded, capturing a state in which the majority of nodes simultaneously require treatment (Fig. 4c,e) .

We can improve dissemination efficiency by modeling it as a commodity flow problem 30, 31 , seeking to optimally utilize the routes of the existing air-traffic network, until meeting the demands of all destinations 32, 33 . In this framework, each air-route is assigned a carrying capacity C nm , capturing the number of doses it can transport per day, and each destination n is assigned an initial demand d n (0), depending on the size of its local population M n . At each step (day), as the therapeutic is shipped and accumulates at n, the local demands are updated, d t ( ) n , subtracting the supplied doses from d n (0), until n's quota is filled at time T n Supp, (Fig. 5a) .

            "text": "While current technology is not fully mature for immediate implementation of decentralization, in Section A we discuss its potential applicability within the foreseeable future, providing estimates for the level of technological enhancement that it entails. We also emphasize that in real scenarios, a combined approach is likely best, where highly capable populations (c n > 1) can ship their excess synthesized therapeutics to less capable ones (c n < 1). This hybrid -physical/digital -strategy can further homogenize the therapeutic supply, and minimize the burden on the transportation networks to treat only the needy destinations. Hence, even if imperfect, decentralization capabilities are a crucial component of future mitigation of global pandemics. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Our findings are most crucial in case the epidemic spreads globally. In such scenario, the peak infection occurs approximately simultaneously at logarithmic time-scales. Equations (8) and (10) indicate that such concurrent global demand cannot be met even under the most optimistic estimates for the capacity C s . Under these circumstances, decentralized mitigation is more efficient, even if it is inferior in other characteristics, such as production rate (c n ) or efficacy (\u03b3). This calls for a change in the current paradigm of classification and prioritization of therapeutics. At present, we focus mainly on the therapeutic efficacy 36, 37 , i.e. how efficiently the biological/chemical agent cures the disease. We relate little weight, however, to the agent's chemical classification -e.g., whether it is a small molecule, a protein, or a nucleic acid, as, indeed, these details seem marginal as long as it overcomes the lethal pathogen. However, these distinctions become crucial if we consider digital-distributability, as not all Figure 5 . Optimizing centralized mitigation. (a) To enhance the efficiency of the centralized drug distribution we used the commodity flow framework: each node is assigned an initial demand d n (0), proportional to its population (node size); and each air-route is assigned a daily carrying capacity C nm (numbers by edges), proportional to its daily volume of passenger traffic. In each time step t we optimize the flow from the source s to supply as much of the therapeutic as possible, within the constrained C nm . As nodes accumulate the therapeutic (blue fill) their demand is updated accordingly. For example, node 2's initial demand is d 2 (0) = 3. Following the first round of shipment (t = 1) a single unit is shipped from s, supplying a fraction . (b) The Gini coefficient vs. t, as obtained from the time dependent fractional stock levels f n (t). We find that despite the optimization, inequality continues to govern the therapeutic distribution, as expressed by the high Gini coefficient at small t. This describes a scenario in which few nodes are fully stocked early on, while the majority of nodes will only reach \u2192 f t ( ) 1 n (and hence Gini \u2192 0) at much later times. (c) The probability density P(f) vs. f at three selected time points t. Similarly to Fig. 3b we observe a highly unequal distribution in which selected nodes are fully supplied (right peaks), while others are still deprived (left peaks). These patterns in (b) and (c) are strikingly reminiscent of the those observed earlier in Fig. 3a ,b. (d) P(\u03be) vs. \u03be, capturing the probability density that a randomly selected node enjoys a supply rate of \u03be \u03be \u03be \u2208 + ( d ). Here we approximate rates as \u03be = T 1/ sn n Supp, , namely the average supply rate in n under therapeutic distribution from s. The power-law form of P(\u03be) (solid line represents \u03be \u03bd \u2212 ) demonstrates the uneven dissemination of the therapeutic, in which supply rates range over orders of magnitude. This pattern of P(\u03be) is, again, analogous with the identical patterns of distribution inequality observed in Fig. 4d ,g,k, further reinforcing the intrinsic heterogeneity characterizing network-based centralized mitigation. molecular media are equally digitizable. Hence, the utility of a drug emerges not just from its chemical effectiveness, but also from how such effectiveness is balanced alongside the drug's distributability.",

Short peptides can be efficiently digitized, thanks to their relatively facile printability 64 ; larger ones, however, often require additional modification 65 , and are hence harder to produce and fold properly. Finally, proteins, essentially very large peptides, are at present too complex for local synthesis outside a biological system, such as a cell culture, therefore prohibiting their current use as locally synthesized therapeutics.",

These building blocks are digital in the same sense that binary data is digital, with the sequence of monomers serving as data bits. Consequently, one can flexibly print any desired sequence using a standard printing apparatus, without specific adaptation or calibration, in a similar fashion to the way a standard printer can print any desired text. In the face of a novel pathogen, such flexibility can provide a crucial advantage over molecular printing. The therapeutic potential of such polymer-based drugs, while not yet widespread, has been demonstrated on several existing treatments, such as Fomivirsen 66 , Pegaptanib 67 and Insulin 68 . Their digital advantage, we believe, merits further research into expanding their therapeutic applicability.",
