METHODS: Retrospective analysis of infants <36 weeks' gestational age from the AWAKEN study (N = 1007). FB was defined by percentage of change from birth weight. Outcome: Mechanical ventilation (MV) at postnatal day 7. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine (14.8%) were on MV at postnatal day 7. The median peak FB was 0% (IQR: \u22122.9, 2) and occurred on postnatal day 2 (IQR: 1,5). Multivariable models showed that the peak FB (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.19), lowest FB in first postnatal week (aOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07-1.16), and FB on postnatal day 7 (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.13) were independently associated with MV on postnatal day 7. In a similar analysis, a negative FB at postnatal day 7 protected against the need for MV at postnatal day 7 (aOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.12-0.35).

While the implications of disorders of fluid balance in premature neonatal populations appear to parallel those of older children, it is critical to understand these findings in the context of the unique physiology and the unique long-term consequence on lung function in newborns. Neonates are born with an excess of extracellular fluid and typically experience a natural diuresis with an expected weight loss of up to 10% in the days after birth. For premature infants, body water content is proportionally higher than in term infants, making the impact of fluid shifts even greater. The loss of extracellular fluid is essential in the normal transition to extrauterine life, especially in terms of pulmonary function, and is accomplished by a negative fluid balance, where urine output and insensible water loss exceed fluid administration. The current study provides important epidemiologic data which shows that the median peak fluid balance in the first postnatal week is 0% (IQR \u22122.9, 2.0). It is particularly concerning that over half the cohort had a peak fluid balance above birth weight with another quarter of the cohort \u22652% above their birth weight at a time when neonates are expected to undergo a physiologic diuresis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 234, "text": "DT Selewski et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 763, "end": 764, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Morbidities that impair this natural diuresis, including AKI, lead to a state of FO that invariably worsens underlying lung function and, in some newborns, lung pathology. The Neonatal Research Network published a retrospective study examining the association between the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and daily fluid intake as well as weight loss over the first 10 days of life. Even after adjusting for co-morbidities and other known risk factors for BPD, higher fluid intake and less weight loss were associated with the composite outcome of death or BPD. 15 Schmidt and colleagues performed an analysis of patients from the Trial of Indomethacin Prophylaxis in Preterms and found in patients without a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) who were randomized to receive indomethacin there was reduced weight loss in the first postnatal week and higher rates of BPD. 16 The authors postulate that this FO may explain the association with BPD. A Cochrane review included five randomized studies comparing restricted vs. liberal fluid intake and morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. This meta-analysis found decreased risk of PDA and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants whose fluid intake was restricted and a trend (though not statistically significant) toward lower risk of BPD. 27 Our study results are consistent with these studies in that the odds of requiring mechanical ventilation at 7 days of age were increased in patients who had a less negative fluid balance. More importantly, on adjusted analysis, a negative fluid balance on postnatal day 7 was protective against the need for mechanical ventilation on postnatal day 7 with an aOR of 0.21. Taken together, these data suggest that it may be beneficial to focus on the avoidance of FO during the first postnatal week in order to decrease short-term and potentially longer-term morbidities.

Daily weights were available for only 91% of all possible patient days, which may have impacted the results. We therefore utilized subsequent weights and may have missed important increases or decreases, though misclassification is likely to have been infrequent. We acknowledge that, during sensitivity analysis, we had to exclude patients who died, which could affect our results and allow us to only generalize our findings to those who survive to 1 week of age.
