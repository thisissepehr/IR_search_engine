            "text": "One avenue for inferring the function of a protein is to learn what proteins it may bind to in the cell. Among the various methodologies, one way for doing so is to affi nity select peptide ligands from a phagedisplayed combinatorial peptide library and then to examine if the proteins that carry such peptide sequences interact with the target protein in the cell. With the protocols described in this chapter, a laboratory with skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry can readily identify peptides in the library that bind selectively, and with micromolar affi nity, to a given target protein on the time scale of 2 months. To illustrate this approach, we use a library of bacteriophage M13 particles, which display 12-mer combinatorial peptides, to affi nity select different peptide ligands for two different targets, the SH3 domain of the human Lyn protein tyrosine kinase and a segment of the yeast serine/threonine protein kinase Cbk1. The binding properties of the selected peptide ligands are then dissected by sequence alignment, Kunkel mutagenesis, and alanine scanning. Finally, the peptide ligands can be used to predict cellular interacting proteins and serve as the starting point for drug discovery.",

            "text": "Very often in research projects, there is interest in mapping the protein-protein interactions of a protein of interest as a way of understanding its function in the cell or virus. While a variety of techniques exist for this purpose, such as yeast two-hybrid screening, mass spectrometry, and protein complementation assays, another approach is the use of phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries. In such an approach, one takes a purifi ed, recombinant protein and isolates peptide ligands to it through affi nity selection (Fig. 1 ) . Interestingly, the phage-displayed peptides bind at \"hot spots\" for molecular interaction and very often share the same primary structure as short regions within cellular interacting proteins. Several examples where this approach has proven useful include such targets as protein interacting domains [ 1 , 2 ] .",

            "text": "To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we describe its application to two targets, human protein tyrosine kinase, Lyn, and the yeast serine/threonine-protein kinase Cbk1. Lyn was fi rst discovered as a viral oncogene [ 3 ] and later appreciated to be a proto-oncogene in humans. It is a non-receptor protein tyrosine Fig. 1 A general workfl ow diagram for isolating and characterizing the peptide ligands to protein domains or fragments using phage display methods. In principle, coding regions of any protein domain of interest can be converted into recombinant DNA and expressed as a fusion protein to a partner such as glutathione S-transferase (GST). With a soluble protein in hand, one can perform affi nity selections with phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries to identify its peptide ligands. The binding properties of those ligands can be then further characterized through affi nity and specifi city measurements. To assess the importance of each residue in the peptide ligand, a mutagenic analysis known as alanine scanning can be performed on the recombinant DNA. With that knowledge, potential interacting partners of the protein of interest can be predicted [ 14 ] . Finally, improving affi nity and specifi city of selected ligands through directed evolution may lead to the development of antagonists, which could be used as inhibitors of specifi c cellular interaction for proof-of-principle experiments of drug development kinase, which is a member of the Src family of proteins. It has a modular architecture: a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, several linker regions, and a catalytic domain that phosphorylate tyrosines in proteins [ 4 ] . The SH3 domain plays a role in mediating protein-protein interactions and has been described to bind proline-rich motifs in proteins. The Cbk1 belongs to a large family of NDR/LATS protein kinases, which is conserved across eukaryotes and includes members such as myotonic dystrophy kinase [ 5 ] . Cbk1 plays a role in controlling cell separation after cytokinesis, cell integrity, and polarized growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 6 ] . To date, only a few substrates of Cbk1 have been reported. One of them, Ace2, a transcription factor that is activated by Cbk1 via three phosphorylation sites [ 7 ] , is responsible for transcriptional control of enzymes required for septum degradation after cytokinesis [ 6 ] . The other, Ssd1, is an RNAbinding protein that suppresses translation of certain mRNAs and which loses activity when phosphorylated by Cbk1 [ 8 ] .",

That modifi cation eliminates the need for generation of uracil-containing single-stranded DNA (U-ssDNA) template, using E. coli strain CJ236 ( dut \u2212 ung \u2212 ). A mutagenic oligonucleotide, containing both complementary and exogenous DNA fragments, is then annealed to the ssDNA template, with the exogenous fragment looping over the TAG-containing vector region. Once the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is synthesized from the ssDNA template, it is electroporated into non-suppressor E. coli strain (e.g., SS320). If the TAG triplet-containing region has not been replaced by the exogenous fragment, the phage will not be propagated as the minor coat protein, pIII, cannot be translated. The wild-type phage can be propagated via the suppressor E. coli strain such as TG1 cells.",

It is relatively straightforward to use homemade or commercially purchased libraries to isolate peptide ligands to a given target and then deduce a binding motif. A peptide with a consensus motif can then be used to study the biology of the target (i.e., predict cellular interacting partner, solve the three-dimensional structure of the peptide and target in a complex, and to inhibit the target in cells). However, when only one or a few peptide ligands are isolated to a target, it is diffi cult to know a priori what residues in the phage-displayed peptide ligand contribute to binding. While one can explore the binding parameters of the peptide sequence through chemical synthesis of peptides with systematic amino acid replacements across the primary structure, we present an alternative, faster, and easier approach involving Kunkel mutagenesis, alanine scanning, and ELISA. We fi nd that by coupling these three techniques, one can readily determine at fi rst pass many important aspects of the binding interaction.",
