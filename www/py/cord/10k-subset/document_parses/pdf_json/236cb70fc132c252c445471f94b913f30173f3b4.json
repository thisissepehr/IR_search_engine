Also, they are associated with hepatitis in mice and avian bronchitis. Data suggest that coronaviruses cause Comment 3 %-4 % of acute respiratory illnesses in humans. The clinical syndrome is usually that of a common cold. Asymptomatic infections also occur, possibly because of partial immunity to reinfection. Coronavirus infections are most prevalent in the winter months and may occur in epidemic fashion, with the same strain being geographically widespread. Recurrent epidemics of the same type do not seem to occur in sequential years. Preliminary serologic investigations indicate that certain strains may infect children preferentially, whereas others are prevalent in adults. An alternative explanation of the findings is the emergence of new epidemic strains with disappearance of older strains for a period.

Treatment with Tween 80 resulted in the detection of a \"rosette\" particle similar to that found with Newcastle disease and Sendai viruses[45]. days, at which time no virus was detected. After slow freezing to -30 C, no virus was detectable when tested after five days. At -50 C, there was an initial decrease in virus titer, which then remained constant for 48 days. After rapid freezing to -70 C in veal infusion broth, there was no loss in titer[4].

This CF antigen has a smaller sedimentation constant than the infectious particle[2]. Smaller antigenic fragments can be produced by treatment with ether or Tween 80. Animal. Specific RS antiserum was produced by inoculation into guinea pigs and rabbits. After immunization, titers were in the range of 1:128 and I :256[1, 2]. Immunization of guinea pigs resulted in the production of serum that showed three precipitation lines when tested against concentrated RS virus[77].

Double infections with RS and influenza A 2 viruses have produced unusual symptomology [111]. 2. Prevalence. a. Virologic. Among infants under six months of age hospitalized for respiratory diseases, RS virus accounted for 50%with bronchiolitis, 25 % with pneumonia, and 13% with upper respiratory infection. Between the ages of six months and two years, isolations were about half as frequent as from younger infants with bronchiolitis or pneumonia, but the rate of recovery from upper respiratory illness was the same [3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 17]. Recovery of virus from adults has been sporadic and has usually been from persons with upper respiratory infections. b. Serologic. Serologic investigations of patients with respiratory disease suggest an infection rate double that indicated by recovery of virus [31, 38, 75]. In one epidemic, the CF test showed that 42 %of all children hospitalized for respiratory illness had RS infection [12]. In a longitudinal study in a small open community, respiratory illness occurred during periods when antibody rises were observed. The largest number of rises in titer occurred in the group aged five to nine years [123]. Maternal antibody is present in the sera of 75%of infants, but it does not prevent illness caused by RS virus [120]; between three and 12 months of age, 35%possess RS antibody. By the age of 5 years, 95% of children have specific serum antibody [3, 11, 12, 27, 31, 40, 41]. Specific secretory (neutralizing) antibody occurs in 40%-70% of infected persons with lower respiratory disease [97, 116]. B. Studies in Volunteers 1. Challenge. A dose of 160-640 TCID so of the second passage in monkeykidney tissue culture of a strain of RS virus sprayed into the nose and throat of 41 adult male volunteers produced typical colds in 20 of them. Thirty-three subjects of this group were infected with RS virus, as shown by recovery of virus and/or serologic response. There were no febrile responses. The incubation period was four days, and illnesses lasted four to 10 days [8, 10]. A temperature-sensitive mutant of RS virus, grown at permissive temperatures of 34 C or 28 C, infected the majority of adult volunteers and produced an acute but mild upper respiratory illness. Growth at 26 C resulted in a decrease in infectivity and a loss of virulence [84].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "c. Prevention 1. Vaccine. Several experimental vaccines have been developed from monkey kidney harvests of RS virus. Inoculation of guinea pigs with aqueous or alum-precipitated vaccine induced seroconversion with neutralizing antibody and also a delayed dermal hypersensitivity to both viral and cellular components of the vaccine. The purified, soluble CF antigens, A and B, did not induce either neutralizing antibody or a hypersensitivity reaction [83]. Inoculation of humans with alum-precipitated, formalin-inactivated RS vaccine resulted in a 90%-100% seroconversion rate, as detected by CF, and a 43 %-47 %rate, as detected by neutralization [62, 76]. However, in all trials, subsequent natural infections in those receiving RS vaccine were more severe than in those given a non-RS virus vaccine or placebo. In one study, 70% of vaccinees who later became infected during an RS epidemic developed pneumonia, as compared with only 10% among those given a control inoculation [91, 92, 96, 98].A strain of RS virus, propagated at 26 C, is as antigenic as live virus, but its infectivity is low. Although other new procedures for production of vaccineStudies in Volunteers Prevention[71] or the use of new adjuvants[103]  are under investigation, none has been proved to be effective in preventing infection, and without such protection, sensitization resulting from parenteral vaccination augments the naturally acquired disease.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "Bloth, B., Espmark, A., Norrby, E., Gard, S.

The observed prevalence of infection varies widely in different years [29, 33] .During a spring outbreak of respiratory disease in 1967, the infection rate in a community was 34 % [22] . From observations in a children's home, it was estimated (based on serology) that 19% of respiratory illness in a single season was caused by coronavirus strain OC43 [26] . Among groups of adults during two of four winters when there were high rates of respiratory disease and infrequent virus recovery, infection with 229B occurred in 10%-24% of those with upper respiratory tract disease [18] .In three separate studies, each covering a seven-or eight-year period, coronavirus OC43 accounted for 3 % of 1,328 illnesses observed in children [26] ; coronaviruses 229B and OC43 accounted for 4 % of colds in an 'adult industrial population [34] , and 15%-35 % of students were infected during three seasons of high prevalence [33] .A serologic survey of adults and children showed that infection in infants below one year of age was infrequent.
