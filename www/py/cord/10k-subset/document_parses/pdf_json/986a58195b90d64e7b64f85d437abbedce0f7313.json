The growing demand of dengue diagnostics especially in low-resource settings gave rise to many rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). This study evaluated the accuracy and utility of ViroTrack Dengue Acute -a new biosensors-based dengue NS1 RDT, SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1/IgM/IgG combo -a commercially available RDT, and SD Dengue NS1 Ag enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for the diagnosis of acute dengue infection. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study consecutively recruited 494 patients with suspected dengue from a health clinic in Malaysia. Both RDTs were performed onsite. The evaluated ELISA and reference tests were performed in a virology laboratory. The reference tests comprised of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and three ELISAs for the detection of dengue NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The diagnostic performance of evaluated tests was computed using STATA version 12. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of ViroTrack were 62.3% (95%CI 55.6-68.7) and 95.0% (95%CI 91.7-97.3), versus 66.5% (95%CI 60.0-72.6) and 95.4% (95%CI 92.1-97.6) for SD NS1 ELISA, and 52.4% (95%CI 45.7-59.1) and 97.7% (95%CI 95.1-99.2) for NS1 component of SD Bioline, respectively. The combination of the latter with its IgM and IgG components were able to increase test sensitivity to 82.4% (95%CI 76.8-87.1) with corresponding decrease in specificity to 87.4% . Although a positive test on any of the NS1 assays would increase the probability of dengue to above 90% in a patient, a negative result would only reduce this probability to 23.0-29.3%. In contrast, this probability of false negative diagnosis would be further reduced to 14.7% ) if SD Bioline NS1/IgM/IgG combo was negative. Conclusions: The performance of ViroTrack Dengue Acute was comparable to SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA. Addition of serology components to SD Bioline Dengue Duo significantly improved its sensitivity and reduced its false negative rate such that it missed the fewest dengue patients, making it a better point-of-care diagnostic tool. New RDT like ViroTrack Dengue Acute may be a potential alternative to existing RDT if its combination with serology components is proven better in future studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Dengue is an emerging infectious disease endemic to more than 100 tropical countries [1] .

Briefly here, for each test, a ViroTrack micofluidic loaded with 30 mcl of blood sample was inserted into a portable opto-magnetic readerthe BluBox. The sample was centrifuged, metered, and mixed with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) pre-coated with antidengue antibodies located within the cartridge. Dengue NS1 antigen, if present, formed sandwich agglutination with these MNPs and were forced to rotate under an oscillating magnetic field, which modulated the intensity of a laser beam passing through them. A photodetector with a Blu-ray optical pickup unit would then measure the phase difference between the modulated light transmission and the applied field, which corresponded to the level of dengue NS1 antigen. This measurement was presented in a relative unit and interpreted by the BluBox according to a pre-set threshold value, where positive was defined as > = 27, negative if < 23, and equivocal (EQ) if 23-26.9 unit.

However, diagnostic tests evaluated within the same study on the same patient population under the same condition can be directly compared [37] . In this study, among all the individual assays, SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA had the best performance followed by ViroTrack, SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1, IgM and IgG components.

The NS1-only assays performed better in detecting dengue infection in the first 5 days versus 6 days and above as NS1 antigen is actively produced and secreted in the first week [7, 18, 22, 29, 30, [40] [41] [42] [43] .

Its test procedure requires minimal training, and is as simple and user-friendly as that of SD RDT at least in terms of sample loading, but its test duration is slightly shorter.

This may create a bottleneck if more than one sample must be run concurrently, unless commercialised version of Blubox comes with the ability to run multiple tests. Yet, the presence of Blubox increases test sensitivity and reduces number of false positive from delayed interpretation common for immunochromatographic tests [8] .
