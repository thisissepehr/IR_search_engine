In the absence of any preventive therapy, 30-75 % of transplant recipients develop cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. account for more than 80 % of invasive fungal infections in solid organ recipients. This co-occurrence of two commonly seen opportunistic infections may end up in fatality. Here, we present a case of concomitant Aspergillus spp. and CMV infection and discuss the relevant literature. A 54-year-old male patient presented with fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain on the 9th posttransplant week after renal transplantation. CMV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 1,680,000 copies/ml, thus, valganciclovir dose was increased. There were inspiratory crackles at both lung bases, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple fungal balls throughout the right lung. Galactomannan antigen was positive, and voriconazole and other antimicrobials were subsequently added to the treatment. At the end of the therapy, on control CT, pneumonic consolidation had disappeared, sputum cultures didn't show Aspergillus spp., and CMV-DNA reduced to 700 copies/ml. The patient showed a favorable clinical response to combined treatment; fever, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain disappeared. Both CMV disease and aspergillosis may present as pulmonary disease; thus, the characterization of one may not preclude the search for the other and the timely initiation of treatment is of paramount importance for good outcomes.",

Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) rarely develops as a primary infection, reactivation of a previous CMV infection or the development of a superinfection often occur in transplant patients. It has been shown that CMV can lead to the development of bacterial and fungal superinfections by trigger cellular immunosuppression in solid organ transplant patients with a history of CMV infection [2, 3] . However, concomitant CMV infection and Aspergillus spp. pneumonia have rarely been documented [4] . There are only 7 cases to date in the literature. The diagnosis of coexisting infections is difficult and, thus, may delay the initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. We report the successful treatment of this coinfection in a renal transplant recipient.",

The immediate postoperative period was unremarkable and he did not experience delayed graft function. He was administered antithymocyte globulin (ATG Fresenius, rabbit antiglobulin) 2 mg/kg for 10 days and methylprednisolone. His maintenance immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus (doses adjusted to maintain trough drug levels between 10 and 15 ng/ml), mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg twice a day), and prednisone (tapered to 10 mg at the end of the second week). He was on valacyclovir 500 mg thrice a day for CMV prophylaxis. He was seropositive for CMV; however, the CMV status of the donor was not known at the time of transplantation.

In the absence of any preventive therapy, 30-75 % of transplant recipients develop CMV infection, and the reported incidence of CMV disease is 8-30 % [6] . CMV disease is defined as ''CMV infection manifesting with signs and symptoms of fever, malaise, leukopenia, and/or documented CMV invasive disease into organs''. The most frequent presentations of CMV disease are fever (58 %), pneumonitis (26.3 %), and enterocolitis (15.8 %) [7] . Most infections are associated with the reactivation of latent CMV [8] . Most complications of this infection occur in the first 6 month after engraftment [9] . The virus can influence the production of various cytokines and chemokines that can inhibit natural killer and T cell responses, as well as target humoral immune responses; in fact, it is these immunomodulatory properties that may be responsible for the indirect consequences of CMV infection [6] . The increased incidence of concurrent opportunistic viral, fungal, and bacterial infections in the setting of CMV infection has been well characterized in the literature. The immunomodulatory properties of CMV are attributed to solid organ transplant recipients' increased vulnerability to these infections [5] . To our knowledge, coinfection of Aspergillus spp. and CMV has been reported in 7 cases in the literature to date. The patient and disease characteristics of these cases are depicted in Table 1 . Some common features of reported cases were as follows: most of the cases were middle-aged males who received a deceased donor renal transplantation. Seven out of 8 cases presented within 3 months after transplantation. Six of 8 cases were treated with amphotericin B and 7 out of 8 cases were treated with i.v. ganciclovir ( Table 1 ). The intensity of maintenance immunosuppression was reduced in all cases and 3 out of 8 patients died, while 1 patient lost his renal graft and returned to dialysis. Interestingly, in 4 of these 7 cases, there was no mention with regards to CMV prophylaxis, while 2 patients were not given prophylaxis against CMV. In our patient, CMV infection developed despite appropriate prophylactic treatment with oral valganciclovir.",

The occurrence of invasive fungal infections is highest in the early posttransplant period, when immunosuppression is greatest. The prevalence of invasive fungal infections has decreased over the last decade, due, in a large part, to improvements in transplant surgical methods [10] . Invasive fungal infections following kidney transplantation are rare, occurring in only 1-14 % of kidney transplants [11] . Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. account for more than 80 % of invasive fungal infections in solid organ recipients [12] . Invasive Aspergillus spp. infection is a devastating complication following solid organ transplantation, with associated high mortality. It typically develops within the first 12 months and is most often seen within the first 3 months after transplantation [2] . Presenting symptoms are usually nonspecific, including low-grade fever, weight loss, fatigue, and dry cough [13] . A recent study reported an incidence of aspergillosis after solid organ transplant of 0.65 %, and the 12-month survival after infection was 59 % for patients with invasive aspergillosis [14] . Another study revealed autopsy findings and clinical associates of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [15] . Forty-one percent of the patients had no respiratory symptoms. Fungal etiology was not entertained clinically in any of the patients. The major associated conditions were prolonged antibiotic therapy, steroid therapy, renal transplantation, and underlying lung disease Our case is the second in which voriconazole was used for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient is currently still on maintenance antifungal treatment with voriconazole and control HRCT showed significant improvements in pulmonary findings.",

Previously, it has been reported that, in a renal transplant recipient, invasive Aspergillus spp. infection was complicated by an aortic thrombus [16] . Autopsy studies in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis revealed angioinvasion [15] . The mechanism of arterial obstruction during invasive aspergillosis remains hypothetical. It was suggested that aggregation of the fungus cells in the intima stimulates endothelial cells to become prothrombotic by expressing thromboplastin that activates factor II and initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade [17] . We think that the reason behind why aspergillosis facilitated the development of thrombosis was the low risk profile of our patient for deep vein thrombosis development. He had none of the risk factors apart from age and recent hospitalization for medical illness. He was fully ambulatory during the hospitalization.",
