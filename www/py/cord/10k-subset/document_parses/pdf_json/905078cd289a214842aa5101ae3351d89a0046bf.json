In order to isolate RV-Cs from clinical specimens and gain a better understanding of their biological properties and pathogenesis, we established air-liquid-interface (ALI) culture methods using HBEC3-KT and HSAEC1-KT immortalized human airway epithelial cells. HBEC3-and HSAEC1-ALI cultures morphologically resembled pseudostratified epithelia with cilia and goblet cells. Two fully sequenced clinical RV-C isolates, RV-C9 and -C53, were propagated in HBEC3-ALI cultures, and increases in viral RNA ranging from 1.71 log 10 to 7.06 log 10 copies were observed. However, this propagation did not occur in HSAEC1-ALI cultures. Using the HBEC3-ALI culture system, 11 clinical strains of RV-C were isolated from 23 clinical specimens, and of them, nine were passaged and re-propagated. The 11 clinical isolates were classified as RV-C2, -C6, -C9, -C12, -C18, -C23, -C40, and -C53 types according to their VP1 sequences. Our stable HBEC3-ALI culture system is the first cultivable cell model that supports the growth of multiple RV-C virus types from clinical specimens. Thus, the HBEC3-ALI culture system provides a cheap and easy-to-use alternative to existing cell models for isolating and investigating RV-Cs.",

Recently, a genotypic classification of RVs based on the VP1 sequence was proposed. According to this classification, more than 160 types of RVs have been classified into three species (A, B, and C) (available online: http://www.picornaviridae.com/) [3] . Receptors of RV-A and -B are intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family members [4, 5] , whereas those of RV-C comprise the recently identified human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3), expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells [6, 7] .",

These systems have provided an important tool for RV-C research. However, isolation of a sufficient number of sinus organs for culture and the stable culture of differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells are difficult. In addition, commercially available 3D human upper airway epithelial cells are costly, and only a few clinical isolates, RV-C2, -C7, -C12, -C15, and -C29, have been isolated using this method; of these, only RV-C7 and -C29 have been passaged and re-propagated [17] .

After being maintained in the ALI system for 30 days, histological examination revealed that HBEC3-and HSAEC1-ALI cultures were likely pseudostratified human airway epithelial cells with cilia and mucus-secreting goblet-like cells ( Figure 1 ). In order to observe the growth properties of the RVs in HBEC3-and HSAEC1-ALI cultures, RV-C9 and -C53 (8 and 7 log10 RNA copies/well), as well as RV-A16 (6 and 5 log10 RNA copies/well), were inoculated in three replicates for each RNA copy number of RV.

Following inoculation of HBEC3-ALI cultures with 8 and 7 log10 RNA copies/well of RV-C9, the RNA levels increased significantly from 4.21 (PI) to 5.92 log10 copies/well at day 7 and from under the detection limit (PI) to 3.78 log10 copies/well at day 1, respectively ( Figure 2A ).

There was no difference at any time point between RV-C9 and -C53 in the amounts of RNA in HBEC3-ALI cultures following inoculation with 8 log10 RNA copies/well.

Considering these results, the different RV-C growth properties between HBEC3-and HSAEC1-ALI cultures were not dependent on cell morphology, and therefore other unknown host cell factor(s) might be responsible for the differences. Further studies are needed to elucidate such discrepancies.",

This suggested that the increased RNA in HBEC3-ALI cultures indicated encapsidated progeny RNA genomes. The most significant increases in RNA levels in HBEC3-ALI cultures inoculated with 8 and 7 log 10 RNA copies/well of RV-C9 were 1.71 and 5.97 log 10 copies/well, respectively, and in HBEC3-ALI cultures inoculated with RV-C53 were 2.34 and 7.06 log 10 copies/well, respectively ( Figure 3A ). These increases in RNA levels agree with those of previous reports on RV-C culture methods [15] [16] [17] . In the HBEC3-ALI cultures, after virus inoculation onto the apical surface, propagated viruses were detected only on the apical surfaces and not in basolateral cultured medium (data not shown). These observations also agree well with previous reports on RV-C culture methods [14, 15, 17] as well as with those on natural RV infections in human airway epithelia [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

The mean RNA copy numbers of RV genome in the 11 clinical specimens from which the viruses were successfully isolated was 7.07 log 10 copies/inoculation (Figure 4 ). Considering that RNA copy numbers in the 11 specimens from which the viruses were successfully isolated were significantly higher, it is surmised that we failed to isolate RV-Cs from the other 12 clinical specimens partly because they contained lower concentrations of RV-C. The clinical isolate 47-SGH-JPN-2015 was isolated from the same clinical specimen as that of RV-C9 using ALI-cultured HBTE cells. Similarly, 4-SGH-JPN-2015 was isolated from the same clinical specimen as that of RV-C53. It was shown that there were no differences between the VP1 sequences of RV-C9 and -C53, as determined by NGS (accession numbers, LC428175 and LC428176) and between those of 4-SGH-JPN-2015 and 47-SGH-JPN-2015, as determined by Sanger sequencing (accession numbers, LC428172 and LC428173). These results suggest that our established HBEC3-ALI culture did not affect the VP1 sequence. Moreover, it is speculated that the same strain might be isolated from a clinical specimen using either HBEC3-ALI culture or ALI-cultured HBTE cells.",
