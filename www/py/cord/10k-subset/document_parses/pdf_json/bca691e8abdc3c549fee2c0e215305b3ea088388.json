However, its effectiveness in non-US healthcare settings is yet to be examined. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection by portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) devices in controlling transmission of MDROs in a non-US healthcare setting. Methods: All patients admitted in the intensive care unit in a 629-bed tertiary referral hospital in Japan from August 2016 to February 2019 were enrolled. During the study period, PX-UV disinfection was added to manual terminal cleaning after every patient transfer/discharge. For microbiological evaluation, surfaces were selected for sampling by contact plates before/after manual cleaning and after PX-UV. After overnight incubation, colonies on the plates were counted. Results: The incidence of newly acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) declined significantly (13.8 to 9.9 per 10,000 patient days, incidence rate ratio 0.71, p = 0.002), as well as that of newly acquired drugresistant Acinetobacter (48.5 to 18.1, 0.37, p < 0.001). The percent reduction of the microbiological burden by manual cleaning was 81%, but a further 59% reduction was achieved by PX-UV.

In this context, pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter are more likely to be controlled. The effectiveness of PX-UV in controlling transmission of Clostridioides difficile is well studied and demonstrated [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , but that of Acinetobacter has not been well investigated. Sporadic transmission of 2DRA has been observed in our ICU for the last five years. In Japan, antimicrobial resistance of Acinetobacter is not as serious. According to the Japanese national microbiological surveillance report, 97, 97 and 87% of Acinetobacter isolates were reported to be susceptible to meropenem, amikacin and levofloxacin, respectively [13] . Therefore, most of the newly identified 2DRA in our hospital seemed to be acquired by horizontal transmission. Until mid-2018, this situation has not been well controlled, despite our efforts for elevated compliance to hand hygiene, strict contact precaution of patients with this pathogen, terminal cleaning using bleach, and in some occasions, restriction of new admission to the ICU. However, by introducing the PX-UV, transmission of 2DRA in the ICU halted. As of June 2019, no new isolation of 2DRA from patients in the ICU has been observed for 11 months (August 2018 to June 2019). Generally, terminal cleaning by bleach is effective in preventing transmission of pathogens via environmental route, however, the result from the environmental sampling in this study, approximately 80% reduction in CFU by manual cleaning, indicated that cleaning by bleach is partially effective in reducing the bioburden in the patient care area. The halt of transmission of 2DRA in our ICU after introducing PX-UV suggests its adjunctive effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 399, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 400, "end": 403, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 404, "end": 407, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 408, "end": 412, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 413, "end": 417, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 418, "end": 422, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 837, "end": 841, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The effectiveness of ultraviolet light disinfection is maximized when performed after every patient discharge from the targeted ward.

They did not observe any statistically significant effect on the incidence of MRSA and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter. The effect of the addition of PX-UV to terminal cleaning by bleach was not observed in the study by Anderson et al. [8] . The differences between our study result and the results from Andersen et al. could be due to differences in the healthcare setting (proportion of private rooms), in the way the device is implemented (disinfecting isolation rooms in multiple units vs every discharge/transfer on single unit), or in the intervention fidelity (proportion of eligible rooms that are disinfected). We operated PX-UV after every patient discharge or transfer from the ICU, regardless of their colonization status, and obtained a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of healthcare-associated transmission of MRSA and 2DRA. This difference may be because undetected carriers of MRSA or Acinetobacter could serve as a source of environmental contamination even under the operation of ultraviolet light disinfection in the targeted rooms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 589, "end": 592, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "No new isolation of 2DRA from patients in the non-ICU ward has been observed for 10 months (September 2018 to June 2019).

First, the effect of PX-UV was evaluated using historical controls when we were not using this technology. We have only one ICU in our hospital, so we were not able to have a nonintervention arm in this study. Second, not all MRSA or 2DRA identified were necessarily acquired in the ICU by horizontal transmission. However, we screened all patients on the day of their admission into the ICU and if they were positive for MRSA and/or 2DRA we regarded it as prior acquisition and excluded them from the acquisition in the ICU. Therefore, we believe that most of the identified MRSA and 2DRA in this study were acquired by horizontal transmission. Third, the microbiological effect of PX-UV was evaluated by comparing the number of colonies from sampling the same frequently touched surface, but with different sites adjacent to each other. If there were significant differences in contamination between sites on the same surface, the result may not accurately reflect the effect of cleaning and PX-UV. We, however, believe that by sampling over 100 surfaces, we can minimize the effect by the heterogeneity of environmental contamination. Fourth, we did not measure the environmental contamination of MRSA or 2DRA by using selective media to sample the environment. For this reason, we are unable to demonstrate the direct relationship between environmental disinfection by PX-UV and the decrease/eradication of new isolation of MRSA or 2DRA. However, it is well known that contamination of the patient care area by the same pathogen that is isolated from the patient is common [14] . We have previously observed contamination by 2DRA on the keyboard in a patient care area where 2DRA was isolated from the patient (data not shown). Furthermore, MRSA, 2DRA and other common environmental flora are susceptible to bleach and PX-UV disinfection.
