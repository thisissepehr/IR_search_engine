Disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier and subsequent increased permeability results from the acute lung disease itself and/or MV. This leads to protein leakage and spillover of inflammatory mediators from and to the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Circulating biomarkers among adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been extensively studied, but the number of pediatric studies is limited. Pediatric intensivists frequently extrapolate adult data to pediatrics but there are significant differences in incidence, etiology, and outcome of acute lung disease in children, primarily related to developmental changes in the lungs and immune system [2] [3] [4] . Nevertheless, circulating biomarkers in children, as in adults, have the potential to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes, to improve our understanding of the pathobiology, and eventually to help to develop more targeted therapies. We present a concise review of \"what's new\" in plasma or serum biomarkers of acute lung disease in children, with a focus on clinical utility and need for future work in this area.

In respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia, there is an association between blood levels of surfactant protein SP-D, Krebs von den Lungen (KL)-6, and severity of pulmonary injury [4, 5] . Combining measurements of plasma Clara cell protein (CC)-16 and SP-D with soluble receptor for advanced glycation (sRAGE), a marker of epithelial injury, is useful for monitoring severity of lung damage in MV patients [4, 6] . Plasma levels of sRAGE are elevated in postoperative lung injury after cardiopulmonary bypass, in both children and adults [7] , suggesting that it is also a good marker of non-infectious pulmonary injury and need for prolonged MV. Given the interaction between sRAGE levels and use of high tidal volume MV on mortality in adults with ARDS [8] , it is likely that sRAGE may be useful in identifying groups of patients with acute lung disease that warrant particular attention to ventilation with low tidal volumes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 295, "end": 297, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 522, "end": 524, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 650, "end": 653, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 867, "end": 870, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epithelial markers"}, {"text": "Various plasma endothelial markers have been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, severity of multiorgan dysfunction, and/or mortality in pediatric and adult ARDS, especially in indirect forms.

Further evidence for the involvement of the endothelium is indicated by the association of increased levels of sTM with mortality and organ dysfunction (PELOD scores), in children with indirect ARDS [12] .

Likewise, it is plausible that markers of systemic inflammation and deranged coagulation may identify patients likely to profit from additional systemic measures such as appropriate hemodynamic support concomitant in severe systemic infection and/or sepsis, early use of antibiotics, or targeted anti-inflammatory or antithrombotic therapies. Recombinant TM, which suppresses high mobility group box protein (HMGB)-1-induced inflammation, reduced fatal outcome in an ARDS mouse model [19] . Since sTM measured in plasma of patients with sepsis and ARDS is a marker of endothelial damage and depletion of TM from endothelium, it may therefore have potential to identify patients that will respond to therapy with recombinant TM. Similarly, vasculotide, a synthetic agonist of Tie-2 receptor, which neutralizes the effect of excess Ang-2 and has anti-inflammatory properties, could be used as a potential therapeutic agent in patients with elevated Ang-2 [14] . Given that pathophysiology and outcome of acute lung disease in a developing child may differ from adults, we cannot extrapolate all adult experience without particular attention to lung growth and repair mechanisms in children. Consequently we strongly encourage further research in this area and advocate for collection of biological specimens in clinical trials. The need to study biomarkers of lung damage in children is both urgent and necessary as it is likely to lead to discovery of biomarkers that will help identify patients at greatest risk of adverse outcomes, and will provide mechanistic insights required for development of novel, patient-specific, therapeutic strategies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 341, "text": "[5]", "ref_id":
