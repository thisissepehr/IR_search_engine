Even with the advent of laboratory automation and the integration of genomics and proteomics in microbiology, interpretation of results still depends on the quality of the specimens received for analysis whether one is suspecting a prokaryote or a eukaryote as the etiologic agent, both of which are featured in this document. Microbes tend to be uniquely suited to adapt to environments where antibiotics and host responses apply pressures that encourage their survival. A laboratory instrument may or may not detect those mutations, which can present a challenge to clinical interpretation. Clearly, microbes grow, multiply, and die very quickly.

What is the susceptibility profile of the organism so therapy can be targeted? To meet those needs, the laboratory requires a specimen that has been appropriately selected, collected, and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Caught in the middle, between the physician and laboratory requirements, are the medical personnel who actually select and collect the specimen and who may not know or understand what the physician or the laboratory needs to do their work.

Clearly, the best outcomes for patients are the result of strong partnerships between the clinician and the microbiology specialist. This document illustrates and promotes this partnership and emphasizes the importance of appropriate specimen management to clinical relevance of the results. One of the most valuable laboratory partners in infectious disease diagnosis is the certified microbiology specialist, particularly a specialist certified as a Diplomate by the American Board of Medical Microbiology, the American Board of Pathology, or the American Board of Medical Laboratory Immunology or their equivalent certified by other organizations.

However, there are some strategic tenets of specimen management and testing in microbiology that stand as community standards of care and that set microbiology apart from other laboratory departments such as chemistry or hematology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TENETS OF SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT"}, {"text": "1. Specimens of poor quality must be rejected. Microbiologists act correctly and responsibly when they call physicians to clarify and resolve problems with specimen submissions. 2. Physicians should not demand that the laboratory report \"everything that grows. \" This can provide irrelevant information that could result in inaccurate diagnosis and inappropriate therapy. 3. \"Background noise\" of commensal microbiota must be avoided where possible. Many body sites have normal, commensal microbiota that can easily contaminate the inappropriately collected specimen and complicate interpretation. Therefore, specimens from sites such as lower respiratory tract (sputum), nasal sinuses, superficial wounds, fistulae, and others require care in collection. 4. The laboratory requires a specimen, not a swab of a specimen. Actual tissue, aspirates, and fluids are always specimens of choice, especially from surgery. A swab is not the specimen of choice for many specimens because swabs pick up extraneous microbes, hold extremely small volumes of the specimen (0.05 mL), and make it difficult to get bacteria or fungi away from the swab fibers and onto media, and the inoculum from the swab is often not uniform across several different agar plates. Swabs are expected from the nasopharynx and to diagnose most viral respiratory infections. Flocked swabs have become a valuable tool for specimen collection and have been shown to be more effective than Dacron, rayon, and cotton swabs in many situations. The flocked nature of the swab allows for more efficient release of contents for evaluation. 5. The laboratory must follow its procedure manual or face legal challenges. The procedures in the manuals should be supported by the literature, especially evidence-based literature. To request the laboratory to provide testing apart from the procedure manual places everyone at legal risk. 6. A specimen should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics. Once antibiotics have been started, the microbiota changes and etiologic agents are impacted, leading to potentially misleading culture results. 7. Susceptibility testing should be done only on clinically significant isolates, not on all microorganisms recovered in culture. 8. Microbiology laboratory results that are reported should be accurate, significant, and clinically relevant. 9. The laboratory should set technical policy; this is not the purview of the medical staff. Good communication and mutual respect will lead to collaborative policies. 10 . Specimens must be labeled accurately and completely so that interpretation of results will be reliable. Labels such as \"eye\" and \"wound\" are not helpful to the interpretation of results without more specific site and clinical information (eg, dog bite wound right forefinger). The microbiology laboratory policy manual should be available at all times for all medical personnel to review or consult and it would be particularly helpful to encourage the nursing staff to review the specimen collection and management portion of the manual. This can facilitate collaboration between the laboratory, with the microbiology expertise, and the specimen collection personnel, who may know very little about microbiology or what the laboratory needs to establish or confirm a diagnosis. It is important to welcome and actively engage the microbiology laboratory as an integral part of the healthcare team and encourage the hospital or the laboratory facility to have board-certified laboratory specialists on hand or available to optimize infectious disease laboratory diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2517, "end": 2519, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TEN POINTS OF IMPORTANCE"}, {"text": "This document is organized by body system, although many organisms are capable of causing disease in >1 body system.

In pediatric patients, if the direct antigen test is negative, and if the direct antigen test is known to have a sensitivity of <80%, a second throat swab should be examined by a more sensitive direct NAAT or by culture as a means of arbitrating possible false-negative direct antigen test results [102] . This secondary testing is not necessarily required in adults [103] . A convenient means of facilitating this 2-step algorithm of testing for Streptococcus pyogenes in pediatric patients is to collect a dual swab initially, recognizing that the second swab will be discarded if the direct antigen test is positive. b Direct and amplified NAATs for Streptococcus pyogenes are more sensitive than direct antigen tests and, as a result, negative direct NAAT results do not have to be arbitrated by a secondary test.

The Gram stain is not the appropriate method to detect PMNs in urine, but it can be ordered as an option for detection of high numbers of gram-negative rods when a patient is suspected of suffering from urosepsis. Because urine is so easily contaminated with commensal flora, specimens for culture of bacterial urinary tract pathogens should be collected with attention to minimizing contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota [187] . Although some literature suggests that traditional skin cleansing in preparation for the collection of midstream or \"clean catch\" specimens is not of benefit, many laboratories find that such specimens obtained without skin cleansing routinely contain mixed flora and, if not stored properly and transported within 1 hour to the laboratory, yield high numbers of one or more potential pathogens on culture. Determining the true etiologic agent in such cultures is difficult, so skin cleansing is still recommended. The use of urine transport media in vacuum-fill tubes or refrigeration immediately after collection may decrease the proliferation of small numbers of contaminating organisms and increase the numbers of interpretable results. Straight or \"in-and-out\" catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides a less contaminated specimen. If mixed enteric bacteria in high numbers are recovered from a second, well-collected, straight-catheterized sample from the same patient, a enteric-urinary fistula should be considered. Laboratory actions should be based on decisions arrived at by dialogue between clinician and laboratory. Specimens from urinary catheters in place for more than a few hours frequently contain colonizing flora due to rapid biofilm formation on the catheter surface, which may not represent infection. Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly discouraged, but if required, the specimen must be taken from the sampling port of a newly inserted device. Cultures of Foley catheter tips are of no clinical value and will be rejected. Collection of specimens from urinary diversions such as ileal loops is also discouraged because of the propensity of these locations to be chronically colonized. Chronic nephrostomy collections and bagged urine collections are also of questionable value. Multiple organisms or coagulase-negative staphylococci may be recovered in patients with urinary stents, and may be pathogenic. It is important that urologists and nephrologists who care for patients with complicated infections discuss any special needs or requests with the microbiology director or supervisor. Specimens from these patients may contain a mixed flora and if specific interpretive criteria are documented for these specimen types, the laboratory must be aware of the documentation and the special interpretive standards. Laboratories routinely provide antimicrobial susceptibility tests on potential pathogens in significant numbers. Specimens obtained by more invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations, should be clearly identified and the workup discussed in advance with the laboratory, especially if the clinician is interested in recovery of bacteria in concentrations <1000 CFU per milliliter.

Acceptable specimens for multiple erythemata or borrelial lymphocytoma, Lyme carditis, Lyme arthritis, and acrodermatitis are skin biopsy, endomyocardial biopsy, synovial fluid or biopsy, and skin biopsy, respectively [259, 261] . Although Borrelia can be detected by NAAT in blood or CSF, its usefulness for the diagnosis of Lyme disease in these specimen sources is limited. For example, Borrelia DNA is detected in the blood of less than half of patients in the early acute stage of disease when the EM rash is present, and if symptoms of Lyme disease have been present for a month or more, spirochetes can no longer be found in blood. Similarly, NAAT testing of CSF specimens is positive in only about one-third of US patients with early neuroborreliosis, and is even less sensitive in patients with late neurologic disease. The utility of testing synovial fluid and other specimen types is not well established and should be considered only under special circumstances and skin biopsy is not generally recommended because patients with EM can be reasonably diagnosed and treated on the basis of history and clinical signs alone. k Communication with the laboratory is of paramount importance when ehrlichiosis is suspected, to ensure that Wright-stained peripheral blood smears will be carefully examined for intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) in either monocytes or neutrophils or bands. l Serologic testing for Anaplasma phagocytophilum is associated with a specificity of 83%-100%, with cross-reactivity occurring in patients infected with Ehrlichia spp, Rickettsia rickettsiae, and Coxiella burnetii, among others.

Classical relapsing fever transmitted by the bites of soft (argasid) ticks burdens residents or travelers to mainly the western United States, although sporadic cases occur in the south-central states. Louse-borne relapsing fever is endemic to tropical countries or may become epidemic in refugee camps; travelers would be the only patients who might present with louse-borne relapsing fever, and their diagnosis would be similar to that for tick-borne relapsing fever. Relapsing fever presents as recurrent fevers of several days' duration, terminating with crisis and resuming after a few days; febrile episodes are marked by the presence of large numbers of spirochetes in the peripheral blood. Relapsing fever-like borreliae (B. miyamotoi) transmitted by the same hard tick as that transmitting the agents of LD cause fever that has a less characteristic presentation and may be confused with human granulocytic anaplasmosis; spirochetes are sparse in peripheral blood but are usually detectable by NAAT (particularly reverse-transcription PCR [RT-PCR]).

HIV viruses are classified based on the relatedness of their genome into types 1 and 2, groups, and clades. HIV-1 is categorized into groups M, O, and P, with M being most common [264, 265] . HIV-1 is more common than HIV type 2 (HIV-2) in the United States, but the latter should be considered in persons who were born in, have traveled to, have received blood products from, or have had a sexual partner from West Africa, as well as those who have been similarly exposed to HIV-2infected persons in any geographic area. After exposure to HIV, HIV RNA is detectable in plasma by 10-12 days, followed by appearance of HIV p24 antigen in serum or plasma at 15-17 days. Depending on the sensitivity of the serologic assays used, HIV-specific antibodies are detectable in serum or plasma at the earliest at 21 days after exposure. Performing an HIV RNA test after a negative initial antibody and/or antigen test in persons suspected of acute infection may therefore be helpful.

Disease is often biphasic beginning as a self-resolving, nonspecific febrile illness, followed by onset of rash and/or arthralgia approximately 1 week later.

Determination of HCV genotype and subtypes (ie, 1-6 and 1a vs 1b) is used to guide the choice and duration of antiviral therapy and predict the likelihood of response to therapy, as different genotypes and subtypes varying in virologic response to current treatment regimens and in likelihood of antiviral resistance before or during direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Pretreatment testing for HCV genome-specific resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) by conventional (Sanger) or next-generation sequencing assay methods is recommended by the FDA and/or current clinical practice guideline (https:// www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/resistance) prior to initiating certain DAA therapy combinations for infection due to certain HCV genotypes: (1) HCV NS3 RAS for simeprevir in genotype 1 infection, and (2) HCV NS5A RAS for elbasvir-grazoprevir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 1a infection, and daclatasvir/sofosbuvir or velpatasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 3 infection. Per recent recommendations from the FDA (https://www. fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm522932.htm), all patients prior to initiating DAA therapy should be screened for evidence of prior or current HBV infection (positive for HBc total antibodies and/or HBsAg), so that affected patients can be monitored and managed appropriately for reactivation of HBV during and after DAA therapy. A human genomic polymorphism interleukin 28B (IL-28B) genotype CC (within an interferon-\u03b3 promoter region on human chromosome 9) is associated with good likelihood of spontaneous resolution of HCV infection in acutely infected individuals as well as high probability of sustained viral response in those receiving interferon-based combination therapy for chronic HCV infection. Now with interferon-based therapy no longer in use for chronically HCV-infected individuals, IL-28B genotype testing is used mainly to predict likelihood of spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "O.

The presence of anti-WNV IgG alone at the time of presentation is indicative of prior WNV infection, and evaluation for an alternative etiology is recommended. Serologic diagnosis of WNV CNS infection may be established by detection of IgM antibodies to WNV in CSF as antibodies in this class do not naturally cross the blood-brain barrier.

Selection between these methodologies (ie, NAAT vs serology) is primarily dependent on when the patient presents in relation to symptom onset or last possible exposure to ZIKV [287] . Currently, the CDC recommends molecular testing by NAAT on serum and urine in symptomatic patients and pregnant women with illness duration of 14 days or less. While a positive NAAT result for ZIKV is diagnostic for infection, a negative result does not exclude infection as viremia or viruria may have passed by the time the specimen was collected. Patients negative by NAAT, particularly pregnant women, for whom ZIKV infection remains in the differential, should be evaluated using a serologic assay for antibodies to the virus. The most current guidelines and recommendations regarding evaluation and testing for ZIKV can be found on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/index. html). False-positive ZIKV IgM serologic results may occur in patients with a prior or current infection with a closely related flavivirus, including WNV or DENV.

Some parasitic infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality (eg, malaria, amebic encephalitis), whereas others cause only mild or asymptomatic disease (eg, filariasis due to Mansonella spp, toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent adults). As expected, the most commonly submitted specimens for laboratory identification of these parasites are whole blood, tissue aspirates/biopsies, and serum for serologic studies. Microscopy remains the cornerstone of laboratory testing for the identification of most blood parasites and many tissue parasites [289] [290] [291] . Expert microscopic examination of Giemsastained thick and thin peripheral blood films is used for detection and identification of the protozoan blood parasites Plasmodium, Babesia, and Trypanosoma, and the filarial nematodes Brugia, Wuchereria, Loa loa, and Mansonella, whereas microscopic examination, culture and/or nucleic acid amplification of ulcer samples, bone marrow, tissue aspirates, and biopsies are useful in the diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis, trichinosis, toxoplasmosis, and leishmaniasis. Although requiring a minimal amount of reagents and equipment, the accuracy of microscopic methods requires well-trained and experienced technologists. Even in the best hands, diagnosis may be hampered by sparseness of organisms on the slide and the subjective nature of differentiating similar-appearing organisms (Plasmodium vs Babesia; various microfilariae) or in identifying the species of Plasmodium present. The laboratory can enhance the sensitivity of these methods by employing a number of concentration procedures such as buffy coat examination, centrifugation, and filtration. In all of these procedures, samples must be properly obtained, transported to the laboratory as quickly as possible, and processed in a timely fashion to preserve organism viability and/or morphology. Organism viability and morphology may be adversely affected by a number of different factors including temperature, humidity, and exposure to fixatives or anticoagulants. Transportation requirements are described for each organism in the corresponding sections below. Serologic assays for detection of antibodies are available as adjunctive methods for the diagnosis of a number of blood and tissue parasite infections. Unfortunately, none are sensitive or specific enough to be used to establish the diagnosis on their own. In particular, assays for infection with one helminth will often cross-react with antibodies to a different helminth [290] . When available, antibody titers may be used to determine the strength of the immune response or detect a trend in antibody levels over time. IFA can provide quantitative titer results but reading the slides is subjective and inherently prone to varying results. In contrast, EIAs typically provide only qualitative positive or negative results determined by an arbitrarily set breakpoint. Thus, clinicians will not be able to determine if a positive result was a very strong positive or a very weak one without calling the laboratory for more information. This can have important implications for interpretation of results that are not entirely consistent with the clinical picture.

Rapid detection tests (RDTs) are particularly useful in acute care settings such as emergency departments or outpatient clinics to establish a diagnosis of malaria quickly while awaiting results of confirmatory blood films. These methods are also commonly used in smaller laboratories or during times (eg, night shift) when personnel with sufficient expertise to screen and interpret blood films for parasites.
