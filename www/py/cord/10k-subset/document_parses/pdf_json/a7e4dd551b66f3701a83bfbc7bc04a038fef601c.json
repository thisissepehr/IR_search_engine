We think an aging society could also induce an increase in ICU admissions and ICU demand. However, the numbers of ICU doctors and nurses did not correspondingly increase with the increase in patients admitted to the ICU.

Human resources may have been insufficient to keep pace with the increase in the number of ICU beds during the study period. Adequate human resource allocation is one of the 15 ]. An international investigation found that Asian ICUs had considerable variation in critical care structure, organization, and delivery, and single rooms and negativepressure rooms were lacking [16] . Estenssoro et al. found that the availability of supporting specialists and key procedures was inadequate in Latin America [17] . Moreover, Sakr el found that a high nurse:patient ratio (> 1:1.5) was independently associated with a reduced risk of inhospital mortality [18] . Recent literature on ICU structure in different regions/countries is summarized in Additional file 6.

Latin American ICUs had a lower nurse-to-patient ratio than Asian ICUs and a higher annual ICU mortality rate than US ICUs [16, 17] .

Here, using the doctor-to-bed ratio and nurse-tobed ratio might roughly calculate the doctor-to-patient and nurse-to-patient ratios. In the present study, 1 doctor to 0.6 beds represented 1 doctor to 3-4 patients (equal staff 24/7).

Fourth, the corresponding outcome indicators of improvements in DVT prophylaxis and sepsis bundle compliance, such as the DVT incidence rate, pulmonary embolism incidence rate, and sepsis mortality rate, were not collected in this study. Moreover, subgroup information, such as surgical vs non-surgical patients and type of admission, was unavailable in the present study. Since our intervention consisted of a series of composite actions, it was difficult to evaluate the contribution of any single intervention in relation to the achieved results. Fifth, the same team was involved, leading to a risk of bias with regard to obtaining objective data. Moreover, the Hawthorne effect, which is a form of reaction whereby subjects improve or modify an aspect of their behavior when being studied, may also have existed in our study [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1630, "end": 1633, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Among critically ill patients treated in ICUs in China, the implementation of a 3-year QI program period decreased the outcome indicator of VAP incidence and improved the process care indicators of DVT prophylaxis, SSC bundle compliance and microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use.
