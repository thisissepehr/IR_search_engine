The authors provide a thorough assessment of the barriers that led to delay in diagnosis in all four family members, and a clear description of the challenges of appropriate management. One aspect not addressed, and which potentially could have had a key influence on the evolution of the disease in all four cases, is the impact of screening for TB -and other infectious diseases -in primary care.",

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) overcome both of these problems. They work on the principle that white blood cells (Tlymphocytes) of a person infected with TB will release interferon gamma when stimulated by antigens unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CFP-10 and ESAT-6). Neither the BCG bacillus nor nonmycobacterial TB have these antigens. The place of IGRA testing is evolving, but studies of serology testing of migrants in primary care show that it is probably a cost-effective way of screening for latent TB infection. 12 A further advantage is that the blood drawn can also be tested for other infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. Modelling suggests that screening with IGRA could replace screening at port of entry with chest radiography. 12",

It is possible that they could have been screened at an asymptomatic stage when the entire family may have had latent, rather than active TB. Positive results of screening would have triggered referral for further assessment by the local specialist TB team. It is likely they would have been offered chemoprophylaxis to prevent reactivation of TB. Early identification of latent TB infection in these family members could have prevented reactivation to active disease and -in the case of those members with pulmonary TB (the mother and children) -potential further transmission to others. Clearly these benefits would only be possible if migrants are able, and indeed encouraged, to register in primary care.

Factors explicitly linked with poverty such as malnutrition, overcrowding, poor healthcare infrastructure and a higher number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) are all responsible for the increased burden of TB in the developing world. 15, 16 Diagnosis of TB is a challenge due to the long latent period, outreach to almost every organ of the body, and varied presentations. Timely detection of pulmonary TB cases, which constitute about 85% of all TB cases, is especially important since they contribute to the chain of transmission in the community. 14 In a high-burden country, the index of suspicion should be high but rational. Any patient with signs and symptoms suggestive of TB should be called as 'Presumptive TB' (earlier labeled as TB suspect) and should be evaluated 17 (see Figure 1 ).",

However, for convenience of implementation, thrice-weekly treatment is acceptable during the continuation phase only if every dose is directly observed (termed 'Directly Observed Treatment' or DOTS). Directly observed, thriceweekly therapy throughout treatment is acceptable if HIV infection is ruled out. 22 Follow-up Repeat sputum examination at the end of the intensive phase and at the end of treatment is required. Repeat sputum evaluation during the middle of the continuation phase is no longer recommended. 22, 32 Any sputum positivity during follow-up makes the patient an MDR suspect and NTPs may advocate culture/DST. Readers are referred to comprehensive guidelines available for the management of MDR TB. 33, 34 Conclusion TB has now re-emerged as a major health hazard, and resourcelimited countries need to build up robust National Tuberculosis Programmes (NTPs) based on epidemiological and clinical evidence to overcome the socio-cultural and economic limitations of the country. Apart from trying to upgrade the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities of the country, the NTPs should also aim at educating health care providers at all levels, increasing public awareness, promoting lifestyle improvement and cough etiquettes in the community. Progressively moving towards universal access to healthcare, adherence to guidelines, and changing attitudes, it is a realistic optimism that the next generation may live in a TB-free world.",

When a patient says, \"Feed a cold and starve a fever,\" they are referring to widely-held health beliefs that can have significant effects on their health behaviours. If they prefer chicken soup to antibiotics for respiratory infections, this can also affect outcomes. Culturally-bound health beliefs and practices can affect consulting rates, attendance at screening programs and treatment compliance, including completion of TB treatment. 42 It has been argued that all medical encounters are cross-cultural encounters. The ability to ask the right questions respectfully, to listen attentively, to learn the cultural lessons presented, and to apply these lessons effectively in diagnosis and treatment, are the legacy of medical anthropology. This, in fact, is a definition of patient-centred care. 43 Linguistic translation is not enough. Cultural interpretation is necessary in cross-cultural medicine as well. Simple questions such as, \"What do you think is causing your problem?\", \"What do you call this in your language?\", \"What do you require to treat it?\", \"What will happen if you treat it?\", \"What will happen if you don't?\", and \"How long will this last?\", are all useful in building bridges of cultural understanding about disease. All doctors learning about their patients' health belief models can apply these questions.",

            "text": "As expertise and trust grew, and social barriers broke down, other techniques were employed. Long interviews and focus group methods were employed to help decipher the codes of health beliefs and behaviours. 45 Parents revealed how common symptoms such as fever or anorexia were viewed as symptoms of malaria or other diseases unfamiliar to their new doctors. Other symptoms such as weight loss and difficulty feeding in the newborn child might call for traditional procedures like excision of the uvula, which were also foreign. A belief in the power of injections to heal compared to the relative inefficiency of tablets might lead to difficulties in adherence to long-term regimens such as TB treatment. Belief in the therapeutic power of blood-letting on the other hand might lead to surprising compliance with requests to appear for laboratory tests requiring venipuncture. 46 The success of culture-sensitive medicine can be seen in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB in the Ethiopian community in Israel. Although cases still appear, as this case report demonstrates, 1 and constant vigilance is required among health workers caring for members of this community, this can be considered a success story. 47 Other developments that are worth noting are the training of community health workers from among the immigrants themselves. The innovative Refuah Shlema program has resulted in the successful integration of motivated, idealistic members of the community into the health care team. Their credibility, respect and effectiveness among their fellow immigrants and the next generation of native born Israelis of Ethiopian origin is a remarkable achievement and an example worth copying. 48 The next challenge the society faces, as infections like TB are overcome, is the growing problem of obesity and diabetes in this community. While almost unheard of in Ethiopia, this is becoming a public health problem. Acculturation has health risks as well as benefits, and unique culturally-sensitive solutions are needed to face this issue too. 49 Rapid international travel and freely mobile populations draw these cross-cultural medical issues into sharp focus. Air travel was implicated in the spread of the recent SARS epidemic. Cultural issues require attention in the management of infectious and non-infectious diseases and will continue to occupy our attention in medicine.",
