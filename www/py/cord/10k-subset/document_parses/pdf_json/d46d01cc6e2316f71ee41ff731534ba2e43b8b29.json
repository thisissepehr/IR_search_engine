The seasonal epidemiology is characterized to occur from November through April in China, coinciding well with both seasonal human influenza and H5N1 in birds [2] . Almost all cases were hospitalized, and 1/3 of cases died. The fatality is much higher than that for seasonal influenza in the China (0.04%), but it is lower than for cases of H5N1 (60%) [3, 4] . Current evidence suggests that human infection appears to be associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including markets where live poultry are sold [5] [6] [7] . In the light of this opinion, the closure of live bird markets (LBM) has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of human infections [8] . Despite the fact that H7N9 remains to be a zoonotic infection of avian origin, there are concerns that the virus show genotypic and phenotypic evidence of partial adaptation to mammals [9] . Compared to other subtypes of avian influenza virus, H7N9 virus show increased binding affinity to mammalian-type receptors, and their amount grow up rapidly at the temperatures that are close to the normal body temperature in mammals (although it is lower than that of birds). In addition, they possess PB2 gene mutations that are associated with adaptation to mammals [10] [11] [12] . Whilst sequence analyses had shown that the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H7N9 virus detected in China show very high homology, whereas the genes for coding internal proteins are diversified [13] . Ferret and mouse models confirm that strains isolated from humans could replicate efficiently in both mammalian and human airway cells, with efficient transmissibility by direct contact and modest transmissibility by respiratory droplets [14, 15] . Given these signatures of partial adaptation to mammals, it is imperative to closely monitor and investigate all clusters of human H7N9 virus to determine the transmissibility and severity of virus infection, as well as its potential host and pathogen determinants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 333, "end": 336, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 530, "end": 532, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 722, "end": 725, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 726, "end": 729, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 730, "end": 733, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 879, "end": 882, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1073, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1455, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1460, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1925, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1929, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "A few of family clusters of H7N9 infections (in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong and Beijing) have been described involving two family members.

Both patients received early antiviral treatment, but it is not possible to determine whether the lack of clinical progression was result from antiviral treatment or as a consequence of a naturally indolent course [24] [25] [26] . Since there were no functionally important differences in the genotype of the virus infecting the three cases, viral virulence is not likely to contribute the differential severity. WHO evaluates all clusters of human cases of nonseasonal influenza virus to determine whether humanto-human transmission or common exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments may have occurred [19] . The homology of all eight gene segments was between 99.6~100%, suggesting it was either a common source exposure or a person-to-person transmission. Whilst all three individuals were exposed to potentially contaminated market environments within a putative maximum incubation period of 7 days, Case 2 and Case 3 had extensive unprotected exposure to the Index cases when he was ill. We believe that most likely explanation for this family cluster is that the Index case was infected from the live bird market, and the virus was transmitted directly from the Index case to his daughter and his wife. Several reasons could explain for this conclusion, as follows: (1) 7 days prior to illness onset in the Index case, he had not been in contact with any people with a febrile illness and other confirmed cases, but was frequently exposed to the A1 live bird market for 9 hours daily and to the D1 secondary live bird market. Although the A1 market was H7N9negative based on the environments samples collected on January 24, 2014, the samples from wholesale market B1 that supplied A1 market were H7N9 positive. Furthermore, 42.30% (11/26) of environments samples from different live bird markets under routine surveillance in Xiaoshan district during the same period were H7N9 positive (Source: unpublished data from the Zhejiang Avian Surveillance System); (2) Case 2 stayed with the Index case and provided beside bed medical care frequently on the January 14, 16, and 17-19. She had close unprotected contact with the Index case for cleaning and washing his body on January 18 without any personal protection when the Index case had severe symptoms such as high fever and cough. Although Case 2 had visited the A1 live bird market for three hours in three days prior to her illness onset, she reported no direct contact with live birds or poultry products. (3) There were multiple potential sources of infection for Case 3, including the Index case, the live market A1, and Case 2. However, the Index case and Case 3 shared the same room every day and worked closely together after the illness onset in the Index case. Most importantly, Case 3 provided beside bed care to the Index case including washing his body, dealing with his secretions, and changing his clothes for him, without any personal protective equipment. The day numbers between the onset of illness in the Index case and the onset of illness in the secondary cases (the serial interval) was 7 and 10 days, [27, 28] . Furthermore, sequence analysis showed that four strains isolated from the three cases were genetically similar to each other. All four isolates possessing amino acids Q226L and G228S in the HA segment were associated with increased affinity for human receptors (\u03b1-2, 6linked sialo-saccharides) [29] . virus from all three cases possessed P42S in NS and E627K and D701N in PB2 (which were associated with increased virulence in mice) and I368V and H99Y in PB1 (which was associated with aerosol transmission of avian virus between ferrets) [7, 8] . There were only two amino differences (V192I in NS and V280A in NP) between the virus infecting the Index case and the secondary cases. Those two mutations are not associated with any known functional change. Therefore, field investigation and H7N9 full genomics analyses supported the secondary cases acquired infection most likely from the Index case. Person-toperson transmission of H7N9 has been reported [30, 31] .
