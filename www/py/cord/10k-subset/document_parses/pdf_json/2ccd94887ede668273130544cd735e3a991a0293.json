The subsequent impacts of these diseases on human, livestock, and wildlife health, as well as the economic effects, have given international health organizations and national governments a greater appreciation of the importance of collaborative efforts in solving health problems. The One Health concept is not new, but under its umbrella, a new generation of veterinarians, physicians, ecologists, biologists, and social scientists is shaping the concept in novel ways. This has led to increased support for One Health initiatives to control disease by international agencies, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations as well as a growing emphasis on One Health concepts in training the veterinary workforce. Veterinary schools are reorganizing veterinary education to better teach students the precepts of One Health. This chapter explores the evolution and application of the One Health concept from the perspective of the veterinarian. The veterinary profession is positioned to be a strong advocate and leader of One Health. Veterinarians have a long history of involvement with One Health activities, and this involvement has adjusted and shifted with the changing needs of society. A new area of work for veterinarians is ecosystem health, which is becoming more relevant as a result of the impact that the ever-increasing human population is having on the environment that supports them.",

Anxiety levels rose even though the human mortality associated with these pandemics paled in comparison to the Spanish Influenza of nearly a century earlier. These pandemics drew attention to the interconnection between humans and the etiological source of the pandemics in animal reservoirs; they spurred the implementation of the global control of such diseases by multidisciplinary teams applying the principles of ''One Health''. Practitioners of One Health strive to generate far-reaching impacts on global health, food security, and poverty alleviation (particularly in developing countries) through interdisciplinary science and integrated control of disease.",

Its origin lies in comparative medicine, the idea that there is no line between humans and animals when it comes to health and disease. When founding the first veterinary school in Lyon, France in 1761, Claude Bourgelat emphasized the importance of comparative biopathology (Vet2011 2012). Later, Rudolph Virchow, William Osler, and John McFaydean carried the concept forward by incorporating veterinary perspectives into human health care through their respective work in comparative medicine, veterinary pathology, microbiology, and veterinary and medical education (Monath et al. 2010 ). In the twentieth century, veterinarians Karl Meyer, Calvin Schwabe, and James Steele maintained this inclusive approach through their work on public health and zoonoses (Monath et al. 2010) . Schwabe and Steele used the term ''One World, One Medicine, One Health'' to refer to their transdisciplinary work (Monath et al. 2010) . Missing from this early work in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the ecologists and environmental health experts. While the pioneers of the One Health concept recognized that environmental factors played a crucial role in the well-being of humans and animals, the value of environmental health for the benefit of the ecosystem itself was not emphasized.",

            "text": "Health and a Profile of the Profession Today Since many argue that One Health is simply a return to the roots of the veterinary profession, it is appropriate to briefly summarize the history of the profession and present a profile of the profession today. In contrast with human medicine, the role of the veterinarian in society has greatly expanded since the founding of the first veterinary school in Lyon in 1761. The school was primarily established to combat an epidemic of rinderpest, the most feared disease of cattle in that era that was ravaging France 2 . Following the establishment of the Lyon veterinary school, veterinary schools 3 were soon opened in other countries in Europe and later in other countries around the world. Throughout the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century, the focus of veterinary education in these schools was on training veterinarians to control disease in food producing animals, to prevent the transmission of zoonotic diseases, and, importantly, on the clinical care of the horse (riding, draft, and warfare). The introduction of motorized vehicles in the industrialized nations after World War I resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of draft and riding horses and this changed the role of the profession in these countries. Most veterinarians employed prior to World War II were in rural practice and predominantly involved with livestock. After World War II, the demand for veterinarians specializing in small animal medicine aroses in response to the growing status of companion animals in society (Smith 2011) . Today in the USA, approximately 77 % of clinical veterinarians work on companion animals, either exclusively or predominantly; those working on food animals, exclusively or predominantly, represent approximately 8 % (AVMA 2012a). For a profession that was founded on protecting the health of animals in agriculture, eradication of zoonotic diseases, and provision of equine care, this shift toward companion animal medicine in industrialized nations has been dramatic.",

In 2010, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), representing more than 80,000 small animal veterinarians around the world, launched a project aimed at increasing companion animal veterinarians' involvement in One Health and, in 2011, the WSAVA and the OIE signed an agreement aimed at taking the initiative further. Given the close contact between people and their pets, it is clearly important to consider companion animals in developing the concept.

Until fairly recently, however, work with zoo animals and wildlife reservoirs was motivated more by entertainment and disease eradication goals than a concern for wildlife or ecosystem health. In North America, the Wildlife Disease Association and the American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians were founded in 1951 and 1979, respectively (Fowler 2006) .

The types of employment available to veterinarians today have increased significantly alongside changes in expertise and demographics. Figure 2 illustrates this variety in veterinary work by listing veterinary professional functions by species and by type of employment. Table 1 outlines the range of responsibilities of veterinarians with regard to One Health. Regardless of the different types of employment within the veterinary profession, it is difficult to identify any sector of the profession that is not involved in One Health to some degree or another. While many veterinarians now specialize in one species or in one sector of the profession, they retain allegiance to their oath and remain aware of and practice the principles of One Health where appropriate. The contributions of veterinarians to the One Health concept are most easily appreciated, when one examines the response to the emergence of a disease either for the first time or in a new environment. It is in this setting when a disease is known to be zoonotic (or suspected to be zoonotic), that the interdisciplinary approach is most readily visible. This ''reactive'' role of veterinarians in support of One Health can be categorized as Direct or Indirect. The Direct Approach to Disease Investigation and Control is exemplified by multidisciplinary teams which come together in the field to work side-by-side in solving an emerging disease problem. This occurred in response to the early outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus infections in Africa, with teams of veterinarians, physicians, epidemiologists, wildlife experts, entomologists, and anthropologists physically working in the field (Breman et al. 1999) . While this is the standard public perception of outbreak investigation (thanks to movies and novels), this is probably the least common approach to working together and generally occurs only when a disease emerges for the first time or in a completely different environment.",

Meanwhile, the race was on to produce an effective vaccine to prevent mortalities in the pleasure, racing, and working equine populations (Monath 2001; Davis et al. 2001 ). One such vaccine, which is now commercially available for horses, was developed in parallel with a similar West Nile vaccine for humans (Long et al. 2007 ).",

Collaboration occurs at professional conferences, via journal publications, and over the web on sites such as ProMED-mail (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, International Society for Infectious Diseases). Surveillance of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus circulation in the field (humans, poultry, and wild birds) and molecular research on the virus conducted in the laboratory serve as an example of the indirect approach. This has involved many veterinarians and physicians working together. This topic is covered in detail by Malik Peiris and Peter Daniels in the next section of this book. Much of this work has been conducted in individual laboratories and then shared at joint conferences, such as the International Symposium on Avian Influenza, the International Meeting on Influenza Interspecies Transmission, and the 4th International Influenza Conference focusing on Zoonotic Influenza and Human Health. ProMED-mail regularly reports on human and animal cases of avian influenza, and the number of journal articles published each year on the topic continues to grow.",

The production of a safe and reliable source of food from ''farm to fork'' involves thousands of veterinarians around the world; the human-animal interface may not be obvious, but it exists. From clinical treatment of individual animals using the appropriate antibiotic on the farm to zoonotic disease surveillance activities in free-ranging wildlife, One Health is being practiced each and every day.

Funding in support of this type of scientific investigation has been traditionally fickle coming in waves for the ''disease du jour'', then quickly receding when the outbreak/epidemic is over and public attention wanes. The introduction of high volume sequencing of suspect agents through metagenomics has opened up the opportunity for this activity to be a scientifically rewarding approach. Veterinarians are in the forefront in this field which has become known as ''pathogen discovery''. A good example of such a program is PREDICT, a global early warning system for emerging diseases supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) within its Emerging Pandemic Threats Program (http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ohi/predict/index.cfm).

Domestic animal health practices have the potential to affect human health. Increased global demand for protein production has resulted in efforts to increase the efficiency of livestock and fish farming. This has led to highdensity animal production facilities and the use of prophylactic pharmaceuticals to maintain health and increase growth rates. Concern is rising that this practice is increasing the potential for the development of antibiotic resistance, and thus decreasing the effectiveness of antibiotics not only for food animals, but also for humans (Anonymous 2011) . Prevalence of multidrug resistance in Salmonella isolates taken from swine production units in the USA is above 50 % (Haley et al. 2012 ); this translates into increased health risk for those exposed to the industry. Farm workers and food animal veterinarians in Europe are at high risk for exposure to the novel livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in regions with high animal densities and endemic antimicrobial resistance in the agricultural setting (Garcia-Graells et al. 2012) . Antibiotic resistance is just one example of the way in which failure to honor the connection between livestock and human health is now affecting our own wellbeing.",

Cases of bovine tuberculosis were documented in free-ranging white-tailed deer during this time period, and continue to be identified in the northern part of the lower peninsula of the state (Okafor et al. 2011) . Eradication of bovine tuberculosis from cattle herds in areas with positive white-tailed deer has been challenging, suggesting continued spill-over from this reservoir host (Waters et al. 2012) . Eradication options for infected livestock herds include depopulation (most often applied to beef cattle), and test and remove (most often used in positive dairy herds). Trials are underway to refine vaccines developed to provide protection against bovine tuberculosis for use in both livestock and wildlife (Waters et al. 2012) . Successful vaccination campaigns against bovine tuberculosis would improve animal welfare by limiting the impacts of the disease on individual animals and by decreasing the extent of culling operations and associated loss of genetic resources.",

DDT was one of the factors leading to the decimation of Bald Eagle populations and the subsequent inclusion of this species on the endangered species list (USFWS 2007) . Weighing the importance of public health needs against these environmental impacts created controversy in the 1960 and 1970s, and eventually led several countries to ban the use of DDT (O'Shaughnessy 2008).

This would seem to indicate the central role of veterinarians in One Health is assured for the future, but this is not automatic. Paradoxically, while the veterinary profession sits on the cusp of the greatest period of opportunities in its history, it finds itself more fragmented and specialized than at any previous time. The profession needs to more proactive, and to prepare for the future by recognizing the changing needs of a global society with veterinarians playing important roles in five intersecting domains of work: public health, biomedical research, global food safety and security, ecosystem health, and the more traditional role of caring for animals (King 2009 ). One Health involves each of these domains to varying degrees, and thus there is a compelling argument that understanding and applying the precepts of One Health must be at the core of the profession.",

In the USA, veterinarians can be diplomates of specialized colleges such as those for veterinary cardiology, veterinary surgery, and veterinary internal medicine. A similar college system exists in Europe. In parallel with the growth of companion animal medicine and specialization, a wide range of subjects are now taught to veterinary students in most schools in the Western world.

Even though a veterinarian specializing at an all-cat private practice is required to be competent in these broad-based skills at the time of graduation from veterinary school, it is generally accepted that the level of knowledge of these subjects by recent veterinary graduates is suboptimal for a career actively involved in One Health, without further training beyond the traditional DVM curriculum.
