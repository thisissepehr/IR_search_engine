Recent experiences have shown that hospitals may be rapidly extended to operate at 120%-130% capacity. 2 Depending on the nature of the disaster, many otherwise plentiful hospital supplies, such as ventilators, may suddenly become insufficient to support the demand. 3 In the event of a large influx of patients in respiratory distress (e.g., a large outbreak of botulism), the number of ventilators available may not be enough to support all of the patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 182, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 479, "end": 480, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 643, "end": 644, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "While government resources would eventually be available, there may be a time when hospitals will need to provide ventilatory support to a greater number of patients than the available number of ventilators.

It runs on wall oxygen (50 psi) and is pressure cycled off the wall oxygen source, and seven can be run simultaneously off a single oxygen supply line by using the Vortran E-Vent Case multioutlet manifold device. One advantage is that this type of automatic ventilator is gas driven (from the oxygen source) and requires no electricity (this may be an advantage in certain types of disasters), is disposable, and is modifiable to provide ventilation for up to seven individuals off one oxygen source. However, this device requires anticipatory purchase, and it lacks the computerized monitoring that standard ventilators have, necessitating more intensive staff support. 5 Another option for providing increased ventilation capacity includes a proprietary device (patent pending) that is essentially a control system for splitting one ventilator to provide ventilation for two patients. 6 This does not have the advantages of the previously described disposable ventilator, because it would rely on an electrically driven ventilator.
