Providing quality care service of neonatal resuscitation reduces neonatal mortality. However, challenges to providing quality neonatal resuscitation are not well investigated in Ethiopia. Hence, this study is conducted to assess the quality provision of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia. Method: We used data from the Ethiopian 2016 Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care survey, conducted in 3804 health facilities providing maternal and newborn health services. We described the quality of neonatal resuscitation services according to the structure, process and outcome triad of quality dimension. Data from registers and birth records for the last 12 months prior to the survey were extracted. In each facility, the three last eligible charts of resuscitated neonates were reviewed and the highest frequency of chart of resuscitated baby was considered to the analysis. Thus, a total of 555 charts were assessed. Logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between the neonatal resuscitation processes, provider, facility and newborn characteristics with neonatal outcome at the time of discharge. Results: The finding suggested that, around two-third, 364(65.6%) of the asphyxiated babies resuscitated by bag and mask type of neonatal resuscitation. Of the babies who had got neonatal resuscitation 463 (83.4%) survived. Resuscitated neonates with a gestational age of greater than 37 weeks and above (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =1.82; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.09-3.04)), availability of priority equipment in health facilities for neonatal resuscitation (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.09, 1.54)) and women who had 12 h and less duration of labor (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI (1.23, 3.13)) were the independent factors of survival of the neonate. Conclusion: Only half of the health facilities were ready for neonatal resuscitation (NR) in terms of priority equipment's. However, eight out of ten babies survived after NR in Ethiopia. Gestational age, priority equipment for NR and duration of labor were determinants of survival of resuscitated neonates in Ethiopia. Therefore, the availability of priority equipment and attentive care and follow-up for premature neonates and those face prolonged labor need to be improved in Ethiopia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Birth asphyxia is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the failure to initiate and sustain breathing at birth\" and accounts for one-fourth of neonatal mortality [1] . Each year an estimated 10 million babies require assistance to start breathing. Five to 10 % of babies born in facilities need some degree of resuscitation, like tactile stimulation or airway clearing or positioning. Approximately 3-6% requires basic neonatal resuscitation, consisting of certain simple initial steps and assisted ventilation [2] . There is an urgent need for neonatal resuscitation in low-resource settings, where access to intrapartum obstetric care is poor and the incidence, mortality, and burden of long term impairment from intra-partum-related events is very high. Delays in initiating resuscitation may exacerbate hypoxia, and leads to neonatal morbidity and mortality [3, 4] . Evidence showed that risk of death increases by 16% for every 30 s delay in initiating ventilation up to 6 min and every 6% for every minute of delay [5] . Therefore, it is clear that the first minute after birth is critical to reduce neonatal mortality. Furthermore, successful neonatal resuscitation by welltrained health care providers has a potential to prevent perinatal mortality due to intrapartum related asphyxia [6] . Newborns with birth asphyxia can suffer from short-to long-term neurological complications [7] . Therefore, urgent referral of complicated birth asphyxia cases to higher well specialized facility is mandatory. As per the updated recommendations of American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics -international liaison committee on resuscitation; neonatal resuscitation program requires at least one trained person to be present during delivery [8] . This requires that the healthcare personnel involved need to be abreast with the latest recommendations and should follow them in their clinical practice.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 178, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 524, "end": 527, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 879, "end": 881, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1309, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1406, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1774, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "According to the EDHS 2016, the neonatal mortality rate in Ethiopia was 29 per 1000 live births [9] .

Appropriate caring for premature newborns and use of partograph to monitor each woman continuously throughout the duration of labor is very important intervention in low-resource settings as prolonged labor and delay in decision making are important causes of adverse obstetric outcomes.

By improving the availability and readiness of NR equipment, Ethiopia can reduce barriers to the proper neonatal resuscitation practice and improve performance that impact to decrease high neonatal mortality in the country [17] . This is supported by evidence from an effective intervention to decrease global neonatal mortality; effective NR could prevent neonatal deaths by 30% as well as improve the outcomes of newborns delivered with birth asphyxia [18] . However, to ensure that newborns benefit from NR, essential equipment, medical supplies, need to be made available and ready at the right place for the right application of the procedure [19] .

Another possible explanation for insufficient skill could be allocation of staff as described by Vesel et'al in Ghana [26] . An additional possible explanation could be the low proportion of non-trained providers that limits the statistical effect in this study. Besides the above, although secretion obstruct babies airway and worsening asphyxia, our findings showed that newborns born with meconium (stained amniotic fluid in the airway who did not start breathing on their own) had no effect on chances of survival after neonatal resuscitation. However, this contradicts with other study done in Kenya [27, 28] which demonstrated that meconium presence was a predictor of survival of neonates after neonatal resuscitation. The possible justification could be, competency of health workers were good in airway clearance in presence of meconium in babies who did not start breathing on their own.
