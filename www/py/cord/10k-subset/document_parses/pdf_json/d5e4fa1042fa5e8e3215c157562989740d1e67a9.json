However, data regarding their usefulness in predicting the short-term outcome of end-stage liver disease are not available in India. This prospective study compared the CTP score, MELD score and MELD-Na score as predictors of shortterm outcome among patients with end-stage liver disease. Methods: CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were determined in 171 patients with end-stage liver disease at a tertiary healthcare centre in India at the time of admission, and the concordance (C-) statistics of the three scores for 3-month mortality were assessed and compared. The aetiology of end-stage liver disease and the clinical presentation were determined. Results: The CTP score, MELD score and MELD-Na score on day 1 were significantly higher among non-survivors than among survivors (p < 0.0001 each). The C-statistic for 3-month mortality for the CTP score was 0.93 (p < 0.0001), that for the MELD score was 0.86 (p < 0.0001) and that for the MELD-Na score was 0.83 (p < 0.0001). The C-statistics of these scores differed significantly for 3-month mortality, and the CTP score was better than the MELD (p < 0.0001) and MELD-Na (p < 0.0001) scores in predicting 3-month mortality. Conclusions: The CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were very good predictors of mortality at 3 months among patients with end-stage liver disease. The CTP score was superior to the MELD and MELD-Na scores in predicting 3-month mortality.",

A final analysis of 13,014 cases of chronic liver disease (19.77%) showed that 33.9% presented with decompensated cirrhosis. Alcoholism (34.3% of 4,413) was the most common cause of cirrhosis, while hepatitis B (33.3%) was the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in general as well as of non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease (40.8% out of 8,163). The predominant cause of chronic liver disease was hepatitis C in the north, alcohol in the northeast, hepatitis B in the east and the south, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the west and differed significantly in various regions [8] .

Patients with ascites due to tuberculosis or malignancy, as well as those with malignancies other than hepatocellular carcinoma, were excluded from the study. Survival at 3 months following the index admission was determined by either telephonic follow-up or patient attendance at the medical outpatient department, if discharged from the hospital. CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were calculated on the basis of laboratory values obtained within 24 h of admission. Patient outcome was assessed after 3 months as \"survivor\" or \"non-survivor.\" The CTP score included two continuous variables (bilirubin and albumin) and three discrete variables (ascites, encephalopathy and international normalized ratio [INR] ). This score was divided into three classes: class A (5-6), class B (7-9) and class C (10-15). The formulas used for the calculations were as follows: MELD score = 3.78 \u00d7 ln(serum bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2 \u00d7 ln(INR) + 9.57 \u00d7 ln(serum creatinine [mg/ dL]) + 6.43; MELD-Na score = MELD score + 1.59 (135 -Na) with maximum and minimum Na values of 135 and 120 mmol/L, respectively [19, 20] .",

The \u03c7 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for comparing the qualitative variables. The prognostic utility of the CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores in assessing mortality at 3 months was calculated by determining the concordance (C-) statistic (equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). Comparison of the C-statistics of various prognostic scores was done by DeLong's test. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed for determining the potential independent predictors of 3-month mortality among end-stage liver disease patients. Only the clinical parameters assessed in all patients were used for the multivariate analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. All reported p values are two-sided.

The mean age of our patients was 48.94 years and a male predominance was seen (male:female ratio 5.1).

Previous studies in France [25] and the USA [29] have shown that the MELD score performs better than the CTP score in predicting 3-month mortality among patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. In a meta-analysis of 26 studies involving 4,732 patients having acute-on-chronic liver failure, the MELD score was found to have the largest AUC (0.82) when compared with other scoring systems estimated, especially for 3-month mortality [30] . Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the MELD-Na score (0.82) or the MELD score (0.81) at admission predicted in-hospital mortality better than did the CTP score (0.76) [25] . A prospective study by Wiesner et al. [29] on 3,437 patients on a liver transplantation waiting list showed that the MELD score was significantly superior to the CTP score in predicting 3-month mortality (AUC 0.83 vs. 0.76). Interestingly, another study analysing waiting list mortality in this regard showed a similar predictive value of the MELD and CTP scores for waiting list mortality [31] . However, in our study, the AUC was 0.93 for the CTP score, 0.86 for the MELD score and 0.83 for the MELD-Na score, and the CTP score was superior to the MELD score in predicting 3-month mortality (p < 0.0001). In the study by Wiesner et al. [29] , the study cohort was different to the cohort of our study, as their patients were on a transplant waiting list. Similarly, Londo\u00f1o et al. [17] found serum sodium and the MELD score as independent predictors of survival for patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, but hepatitis C (44%) was the commonest aetiology of cirrhosis among their patients, followed by alcohol (26%), both alcohol and hepatitis C (8%), hepatitis B (7%) and other aetiologies (15%), while alcohol was the most common cause of cirrhosis among our patients.",

            "text": "Our results are supported by some other studies which failed to confirm the superiority of the MELD to the CTP score [32] [33] [34] . A study by Heuman and Mihas [33] on 6,958 patients showed that the CTP score slightly outperformed the MELD score in predicting 3-month mortality (AUC 0.76 vs. 0.75), and the authors suggested that the superiority of the MELD score observed by Wiesner et al. [29] was probably the result of selection bias. In a study involving 257 patients with cirrhosis at the liver transplantation centre of Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran, the statistical analysis of the prediction of mortality or removal from the waiting list due to severe deterioration showed an AUC of 0.75 for the CTP score and 0.69 for the MELD score [34] . The better performance of the CTP score compared to those of the MELD/MELD-Na scores in our study appears to have its basis in the different aetiologies and clinical presentations, which can vary depending on the country and region of the world. As the different prognostic scores have varying components, a particular prognostic score may perform better for a particular clinical presentation. In our study, 63.15% (108/171) of the patients had ascites and 32.74% (56/171) had hepatic encephalopathy, while in a study by Dupont et al. [25] in France, ascites was observed only in 4.98% (14/281) of the patients and hepatic encephalopathy in 9.96% (28/281) of the patients. They found the MELD and MELD-Na scores to be better than the CTP score in predicting in-hospital mortality among cirrhotic patients. Although in our study as well as in their study, the mean serum sodium level was significantly lower among nonsurvivors than among survivors, the higher number of patients with ascites and hepatic encephalopathy in our study might have contributed to the better performance of the CTP score compared to the MELD/MELD-Na scores in predicting 3-month mortality among the cirrhotic patients in our series. It therefore appears logical that a particular scoring method may be preferred over others in the assessment of chronic liver disease based on different clinical settings, aetiologies, or regions of the world.",
