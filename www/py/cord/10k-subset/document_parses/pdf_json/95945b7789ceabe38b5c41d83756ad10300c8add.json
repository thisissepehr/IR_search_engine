The aim of this study was to determine the 24 months outcome of AKI following admission to PICU. Methods: We followed 80 children admitted to PICU with a diagnosis of AKI,based on pediatric modified RIFLE criteria, for two years. The impact of AKI on the two-year mortality was estimated using the Cox proportionalhazards regression model. Factors affecting long-term progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including hypertension and proteinuria, were also evaluated. Results: The mortality at two years follow-up was 48% with the highest mortality occurred during the first four months post PICU admission (40%). By the end of two years; 22.2% had reduction in the GFR, 33.3% had proteinuria and 73.3% were hypertensive. Proteinuria of 30 mg/dl or more at baseline was associated with worse renal function during follow-up. Based on RIFLE criteria ; failure stage at the time of admission increased the two-year mortality rate by more than three times, as compared to risk stage. Renal injury, on the other hand, did not increase mortality rate. Conclusions: AKI was associated with high mortality particularly in the first four months following admission to PICU. Significant percentage of the survivors had evidence of CKD after two years of follow-up.

High incidence and under-recognition has led to the development of a national AKI programme. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of AKI in children and to investigate its recognition and management. This multi-centre project was supported by the BAPN Methods: Creatinine measurements performed at 3 tertiary and 3 district general hospitals over a six-month period (01/07/12-31/12/12) were evaluated using the NHS AKI alert algorithm. Patients age 29 days to 17 years old were included. A subset of children were randomly selected for case note review. Information was obtained from paper and electronic patient notes. AKI stage 1 was defined as a rise of 1.5-<2x baseline creatinine level; AKI stage 2 a rise of 2-<3x baseline and AKI stage 3 a rise of >3x baseline. Results: 57,278 creatinine measurements were analysed during the study period with 5325 (10.8%) AKI alerts in 1112 patients. There were AKI 1 (62%), AKI 2 (16%) and AKI 3 (22%) alerts during the study period. The age distribution: 222 (20%) <1y, 432 (39%) 1-<6y, 192 (17%) 6-<11y, 207 (19%) 11-<16y and 59 (5%) 16-17y. AKI 1 was the largest group across all ages and a third of all alerts were in children under 6y. There were no gender differences but significant differences between centres for AKI alerts. We reviewed case notes of 66 children (39 boys) aged between 29 days to 17y. AKI was recognised in 18 patients (27.3%). Of all patients, only 17% had a pre-existing renal condition and were known to nephrology. 30% of patients had urine tested and 66% had medication dosage adjusted to estimated GFR. Conclusions: Our data indicate that AKI remains clinically under-recognised in children and there is a need for education about its management. Timely recognition and optimal management of AKI is important to improve long term renal outcomes.

This intense elevation of inflammatory molecules was accompanied by significantly increased urinary levels of Angiotensin I (p=0,0017), Angiotensin-(1-7) (p<0,0001), and ACE 2 (p<0,0001). On the other hand, ACE concentrations were significantly reduced and Angiotensin II levels were similar when compared to control group. Conclusions: The increased levels of cytokines and chemokines suggest that PUV leads to a pro-inflammatory state that might be part of the pathophysiology of this anomaly. The observed activation of the protective arm of the RAS, formed by ACE2-Angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor, may play a role in modulating the intense inflammatory process triggered by PUV. Objectives: To compare outcomes of patients (pts) with LUTO stratified by severity using a prenatal classification system. Methods: Retrospective chart review of LUTO cases evaluated at the Texas Children's Hospital Fetal Center from 2012-2015. LUTO classification: Stage I: normal amniotic fluid level (>18wks gestation), favorable fetal urinary indices*, absence of renal cysts or dysplasia; Stage II: oligohydramnios (>18wks), severe bilateral hydronephrosis, favorable urinary indices, absence of renal cysts or dysplasia; Stage III: oligohydramnios (>18wks), severe bilateral hydronephrosis, unfavorable urinary indices, presence of renal cysts or dysplasia. *Favorable fetal urinary indices: Na <100mEq/L, Chloride <90 mEq/L, Osm <200 mOsm/L, \u03b22-microglobulin <6mg/L Results: 42 total LUTO cases were seen in the study period. Five underwent termination of pregnancy and 1 had intrauterine fetal demise. Therefore, 36 pts were evaluated: 6 stage I, 18 stage II and 12 stage 3. No pts with stage I LUTO had fetal intervention, while 100% of stage II and 25% of stage III underwent vesicoamniotic shunting. Gestational age at delivery and birth weight were similar between the groups. A greater percentage of neonatal deaths occurred in the stage III group (67%) compared with stage II (17%) or stage I (0%). 75% of surviving stage III pts required dialysis as neonates, and 100% were dialysis dependent by 1yr of age. Overall, 64% of pts were alive at 1 yr. Five pts underwent neonatal dialysis with 80% 1 yr survival. For non-dialysis pts estimated GFR at 1 yr was not significantly different between Stage I and II. Conclusions: Prenatal LUTO staging is clinically useful as it is strongly associated with both neonatal survival and the need for neonatal dialysis. In addition, LUTO pts who survive the neonatal period, regardless of the need for dialysis, are likely to be alive at 1 yr of age.",

Median age was 4 years. All pts had systemic arterial hypertension stage 2. Fibromuscular dysplasia was diagnosed in 8/27 pts, Takayasu arteritis in 8/27, Williams syndrome in 5/27, neurofibromatosis in 4/27, 1 pt was diagnosed with renal artery compression by pheochromocytoma. The vascular lesion presented as mid aortic syndrome with bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) in 12/27 pts, unilateral RAS in 10/27 and bilateral RAS in 5/27 pts. Besides anti-hypertensive medication, angioplasty was performed in 12/27 pts, aortorenal surgery in 9/27, auto-transplantation in 1/27, excision of pheochromocytoma in 1 pt; 4/27 pts were managed exclusively with anti-hypertensive medication. Left ventricular hypertrophy was diagnosed in 21/27 children. 29 ABPM studies were performed in 16 pts at different treatment phases; 24 ABPM recordings were analyzed (5 were excluded by failure of the measures). After therapeutic management, only 1/16 pt achieved BP control by ABPM standards: systolic and diastolic (S/D) BP means < 95th percentile and BP load < 25%, with S/Dnocturnal BP dipping of 8.7% and 14.2% respectively. The remaining 15 pts demonstrated severe ambulatory hypertension, with SBP/ DBP means values \u00e2'\u00e2'> 95th percentile and loads > 50%. S/D nocturnal BP dipping was present in 5/24 (range 10% -18.3%) and 19/24 (range 12.1% -26.6%) recordings respectively.

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of blood pressure abnormalities by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in a large European cohort of children with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney diseases (ADPKD). Methods: Multicentric retrospective study. Inclusion criteria: age < 18 years, ABPM recording, basic anthropometric and laboratory data, ADPKD diagnosis based on family history and renal cysts or on genetic test. Results: 310 patients were enrolled in 22 European centers (M:F ratio 162:148; mean age 11.5 \u00b1 4.2 years). When present, paternal and maternal inheritance were equally distributed (43% -44%). A minority of patients underwent genetic testing: PKD1 and PKD2 mutations were reported in 32% and 0% of patients, respectively. Only 7 patients (2.2 %) had a eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73mq. Overall, 34% of patients had 24h mean ABPM values > 95th percentile or were treated with blood pressure medications. Pre-hypertension was present in 10% of patients and borderline hypertension in 26% of patients. Daytime heart rate was significantly lower in ADPKD children compared to healthy controls (p<0.001). A significant proportion of patients had elevated nighttime blood pressure values: 35% were non-dippers and 19% had isolated nocturnal hypertension. As expected, the proportion of patients with enlarged kidneys increased with age; conversely, correlation between age and hypertension was weak. Further rhythm analysis revealed a very high prevalence of circadian and ultradian rhytms in ADPKD patients, including pre-pubertal children. These abnormalities exceeded those reported in children with chronic renal failure. Conclusions: Despite potential recruitment biases, this study shows very high prevalence of blood pressure abnormalities in children with ADPKD, suggesting autonomic dysregulation and early onset of cardiovascular damage.",

Lymphatic vessel density is markedly lower, but again 70% higher in infants. Omental blood capillary density correlates with parietal capillary density (r = 0.391; p = 0.03), small lymphatic vessels are few. Uremia reduces omental but not parietal blood vessel density by 51%, Angp-2 levels are 78% lower. The submesothelial 3 vessel layer structure dissipates with low GDP PD, blood vessel density increases 2-3 fold, as do TGF-\u00df/pSMAD, VEGF, activated fibroblast and CD45/CD68+ macrophage abundance. Mild lumen narrowing develops in 31% of blood vessels, lymphatic vessel density remains low. EMT and profibrotic CD90+ fibroblast subpopulations appear more prevalent with high GDP PD-fluids. D/P creatinine ratios correlate with parietal peritoneal vessel density at baseline (r=0.49, p<0.05), and while on PD (r=0.57, p=0.08) but not with submesothelial thickness.

In the current interventional clinical trials, TKV measurement by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been shown to be more accurate, reproducible and able to detect small changes over a short period of time compared to ultrasound (US). Since future therapies in ADPKD could be extended to include children, we aimed to examine whether the high-resolution 3D-US TKV measurements might be used as an alternative method to MR measurements in ADPKD children Methods: Prospective evaluations of renal MR, 2D-and 3D-US were performed, whereby TKV was calculated by means of manual delineations (MR, 3D-US) or by the ellipsoid method (2D-US). Correlations and differences between parameters were evaluated using Pearson r and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. After correction using the optimal linear regression, the variability of the measurements was examined using Bland-Altman plots Results: We studied 29 patients (17 male, 12 female) with a median age (SD) of 14.0 (3.4) years and eGFR 111 (17) Objectives: Mutations of the Pkhd1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Pkhd1 encodes fibrocystin (FPC), a ciliary type I membrane protein of largely unknown function, suggested to affect adhesion signaling of cells. Contributions of epithelial cell adhesion and contractility to the disease process of ARPKD are elusive. Here, we establish a link between loss of FPC function and epithelial morphogenesis in 3D cell culture, cell contact formation and cytoskelal networks. Methods: We analyze FPC function in Madin-Darby canine renal collecting duct epithelial cells (MDCK) based on Pkhd1 silencing. Cells are studied on micro-pattered chips in 3D cell culture conditions allowing analysis of polarity, lumen formation and ciliogenesis in epithelial spheroids. Quantitative automated image processing is applied to analyze z-stacks of 5-color fluorescence images. To determine critical differences in cell adhesion parameters, MDCK cells are studied also on chips in their one and 2(4)-cell stages. Activation of adhesion signaling is addressed based on phosphorylation of the FAK/Src axis. Results: Using defined adhesion conditions, we quantified the impact of FPC deficiency on size / density of adhesion sites, cell shape characteristics and initiation of an apical surface. Effects on apicobasal polarity and lumen formation correlate significantly with positioning of centrosomes in 2(4)-cell stages and activation of adhesion signaling. In addition, FPC deficient cells reveal defects in the formation of correctly polarized epithelial spheroids. Transient reduction of actomyosin contractility restores 70% of correct epithelial morphogenesis (p<0.01).",

Ayivi (1) Objectives: Nigeria has the largest burden of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in the world. Kidney abnormalities are established findings in children with SCA and are known to start early in childhood. The study objective was to determine the risk factors associated with microalbuminuria in children with sickle cell anaemia and the relationship between it and glomerular filtration rate Methods: The study was descriptive and cross sectional involving 323 children with sickle cell anaemia in steady state and equal number with normal haemoglobin, age and sex matched as control. They were aged 6 months to 18 years and consecutively recruited from the paediatric outpatient department of the Jos University Teaching Hospital between September and December 2013. Anthropometric, demographic characteristics and clinical parameters of each child and the social status of the parents were obtained. Spot urine and venous blood samples were obtained for determination of microalbuminuria, packed cell volume and serum creatinine respectively. Results: The prevalence of microalbuminuria in children with SCA was 26% in 84 children, compared to 1.85% in controls. Of this, 87% were aged ten years or less and there was no sex difference. Anaemia and elevated glomerular filtration showed strong positive correlation with microalbuminuria, however, age, low socio economic status, number of siblings with SCA, did not. Glomerular filtration rate was higher in subjects with SCA than controls and as well in those with microalbuminuria compared to those without microalbuminuria (p<0.01).",

These findings suggest that abnormalities in lipid metabolism may play an important role in nephrolithiasis. Targeting these proteins may have preventive and therapeutic benefits. Objectives: Single center studies report neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence of 12-70%; neonates with AKI appear to have worse outcomes. These findings prompted the formation of the Neonatal Kidney Collaborative (NKC) and the development and implementation of the AWAKEN study. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of neonatal AKI and its association with outcomes in a large, multi-national cohort Methods: NKC includes 24 institutions from 4 countries (USA, Canada, Australia and India). Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions from Jan 1 to Mar 31, 2014 were screened. Inclusion criteria need for intravenous (IV) fluids \u226548 hrs. Exclusion criteria: 1) admission at > 2 weeks of age, 2) congenital heart disease requiring surgical repair at < 7 days of age, 3) lethal chromosomal anomaly, 4) death within 48 hours of admission, 5) severe congenital kidney disease. AKI was defined as either urine output (UOP) < 1 mL/ kg/hr during any 24 hour period from days 2-7 of life, a rise in serum creatinine (SCr) of 0.3 mg/dL from previous lowest value and/or receipt of renal replacement therapy. (Table) Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that at least 35.4% of infants admitted to NICU who required IV fluids develop AKI. Subjects with AKI have worse increased risk of death and longer LOS. Our data contribute to the growing evidence that neonatal AKI is common, with significant impact on clinical outcomes. Further analysis of this robust database is underway.",

As B-cell depletion can impact T-cell function, this study aimed to characterize T-cell subsets in FSGS patients in order to identify an immunological signature predictive of favorable response to rituximab therapy. Methods: 22 consecutive FSGS patients (median age 14.4 years, range 6.2-25.0 years) who received rituximab as third line therapy following steroids and calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), were included in the study. Clinical parameters including urinary protein excretion and serum albumin, as well as immunological subset monitoring were performed at baseline, 14-days, 1-month, and subsequently 3-monthly until relapse. Baseline immunological subsets were compared between rituximab responders and non-responders, as well as 22 patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) in relapse and 30 healthy controls, using Mann-Whitney U Test. Paired comparison was done using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: 12 of 22 patients (54.5%) responded to rituximab therapy, defined as resolution of proteinuria and ability to wean off steroids and CNI at 3 months following rituximab treatment. Mitogen-stimulated T-cell activation subset expressions are shown in the Table 1 below. Mitogen-stimulated CD154 + CD4 + CD3 + expressions before rituximab were significantly lower in FSGS responders compared to non-responders and controls. IFN-\u03b3 + CD3 + and IL-2 + CD3 + were similarly decreased in FSGS responders compared to nonresponders, MCNS and controls. Significant recovery of all 3 subsets in FSGS responders occurred 6 months post-rituximab treatment. Using ROC analysis, activated CD154 + CD4 + CD3 + (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.61-1.01), IFN-\u03b3 + CD3 + (AUC 0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.05) and IL-2 + CD3 + (AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.57-0.98) were good predictors of response to rituximab.",

We have previously reported that a history of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a risk factor for early relapse after the treatment of single dose of rituximab followed by immunosuppressants (Kamei K et al. Pediatr Nephrol 2016) . However, duration of B-cell depletion is different between each patient. Here, we investigated the duration between B-cell recovery and first relapse and calculated risk factors for early relapse after B-cell recovery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children with refractory SDNS who received a single dose of rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) between June 2007 and November 2013. All patients continued immunosuppressants after rituximab treatment. B-cell recovery was defined as CD19>1% lymphocyte after rituximab treatment. Kaplan-Meier analyses for relapse after B-cell recovery were conducted. The differences between groups (history of SRNS (SR) vs. no history of SRNS(nSR)) were compared using the log-rank test. Hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for relapse after B-cell recovery was evaluated by the Cox regression analysis. Results: Fifty-five patients (40 boys and 15 girls) received rituximab. The median follow-up period were 308 days (35-2,505 days). Fifty-percent relapse free survival was significantly shorter in SR than in nSR (238 days vs. 1,001 days, p=0.014) ( Figure 1 ). Results of Cox regression are shown in Table 1 .",

Anemia of CKD is due to numerous factors, including impaired renal EPO synthesis and intestinal iron absorption. EPO resistance in CKD is a known clinical problem, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. EPO receptor (EPOR) signals are transduced through a JAK2-STAT5 pathway. Here we investigated the HIF-EPO-EPOR axis in kidney, BM and proximal tibia/epiphyseal growth plate (EGP) in anemic juvenile CKD rats.",

By RNA-seq techniques, we further investigate the different expression of related transcriptions after the disruption of Gen1. Results: 1) Gen1 is ubiquitously expressed in the mesoderm of E10.5 embryos, including MM and UB regions. Over 60% Gen1 PB/PB newborn pups were detected different abnormalities of kidney and urinary tract, in which duplex kidney were the most common anomalies, hydronephrosis, renal agenesis, renal hypoplasia, VUR and UVJO also were not rare. 2) Over 50% Gen1 PB/ PB mice grew supernumerary ectopic UB. The ND of E10.5d Gen1 PB/PB mice cultured in vitro didn't show higher sensitivity to GDNF compared to WT mice. RNA-seq analysis of E10.5 MM revealed Grem1, a BMP4 antagonist that positively regulates UB formation, as the only gene that was significantly up regulated.

Conclusions: This study reports good short-term renal allograft survival in kidneys that were initially declined for paediatric recipients and then subsequently transplanted. While most children who have a kidney declined on their behalf will eventually be transplanted, they wait more than 6 months on average to get a kidney transplant. In view of the advantages of timely transplantation in children, criteria for accepting kidneys for paediatric recipients could be reviewed.",

For pts diagnosed since 2011, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, central nervous system and pulmonary TMA manifestations occurred in the 6 months prior to baseline in 143 (68%), 80 (38%), 60 (28%), 45 (21%) and 24 (11%) paediatric pts, respectively and were least common in pts with MCP mutations. Five years after disease onset, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) had occurred in 26% of paediatric pts as compared with 46% of adults (Fig 2) .

The incidence rate of first-time AP was 9.5 per 1000 person-years for the overall cohort, 6.2/1000 pers./yrs for PD and 15.4/1000 pers./yrs for HD (p=0.04, Fisher's test). The median age at AP diagnosis was 10 yrs (range 3-16) and median time on dialysis was 11 months (0.5-68). In 7 pts (58%) diagnosis leading to ESRD was renal dysplasia and 6 patients (50%) were affected by motor-cognitive abnormalities. All pts were hospitalized for a median time of 25 days (2-180). Median peak serum amylase and lipase was 1125 UI/L (234-3431) and 2885 UI/L (612-8140), respectively. Instrumental diagnostic features at presentation included enlarged pancreas (80%) and peripancreatic fluid collections (33%). In 1 case, AP was diagnosed shortly after an abdominal surgery with exposure to propofol. At AP diagnosis, 4 pts were receiving valproic acid and 2 pts enalapril. In 3 cases, AP course was complicated by a pancreatic pseudocyst. One child required a shift from PD to HD because of abdominal pain. Two pts experienced recurrent AP, while there were no deaths related to AP. Conclusions: In our experience, children on dialysis show a significantly increased risk for AP compared with the general pediatric population (estimated incidence rate of 0.15/1000 pers./yrs). A higher incidence is observed in children on HD and in those with neurological co-morbidities. Objectives: Bartter syndrome (BS), a normotensive hypokalemic tubulopathy, has been clinically known for decades and genotypically characterized. As pediatric diagnosis and patient management improve, more patients survive to adulthood, potentially developing new complications. We summarized our experience with a group of 13 young adults with BS of 2 genotypic variants: type 2, due to mutations in ROMK (BS-2) and type 4, due to mutations in the barttin gene (BS-4). All BS-4 patients carry the same mutation and belong to an extended family of Arab origin. Methods: Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. All patients have been treated since infancy with standard of care medications, including salts (NaCl and KCl) supplementation. Indomethacin was administered only when eGFR was normal.",

Objectives: Socio-economic disadvantage is increasingly recognised as an important risk factor for chronic disease, but the strength of the association with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the contribution of the various domains of disadvantage are uncertain. The aim of this study was to synthesise the evidence regarding the risk of CKD and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the general population according to markers of socioeconomic disadvantage. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and summary effects were estimated using random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. We included published primary articles in MEDLINE, EMBASE or CINAHL (until December 2014) that were cohort studies conducted in the general population. We included studies investigating the risk of incident CKD (and stage) and any of the following social determinants: ethnicity, education, income, occupation and area level measures of socio-economic status. Results: We identified 21 studies (n=12,987,147) -13 investigated risk by ethnicity, education (9), income (6), area level socio-economic status (4) and occupation (2). Only two of the included studies were of high risk of bias. Black Americans have more than double the risk of ESKD compared to white Americans (hazard ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 2.02 to 2.63, I 2 59%). Low income was found to increase risk of ESKD in four of the six studies identified, however low education and low SES were not consistently identified as risk factors for CKD. Conclusions: Although there is a substantial body of evidence regarding the association between socioeconomic disadvantage and CKD, there appears to be an inconsistent relationship. This may be artefactual, due to difficulties in quantifying disadvantage, or reflect true underlying differences in the association across different settings.",

We determined differences between groups on PedsQL\u2122 mean scores, and the proportion of children with an impaired HRQoL (\u22651 SD lower than the healthy norm). Linear regression models were used to explore determinants of HRQoL. Conclusions: This is the first international study examining HRQoL in the paediatric ESRD population. We found important decrements in HRQoL in this specific population, even after successful transplantation.

Conclusions: More than half children who receive renal-replacement therapy haveknown and novel disease-associated variations in genes associated withinherited kidney disease. This study shows that next generation sequencing analysis of pediatric end-stage renal disease patients is accurate and revealing. This analysis should be considered part of the routine genetic workup of end-stage renal disease, where the proportion of genetic mutation is high but requires sequencing of multiple genes. Conclusions: Urinary metabolomic profiling is a feasible technology to help identify metabolites that can distinguish SRNS from SSNS.",

Leveraging on advances in high throughput technologies and bioinformatics, we attempt to examine an extended range of urinary proteomes that may be implicated. Methods: In this prospective cohort analytical study, patients aged 1 month or more with a clinical diagnosis of 1st febrile UTI were recruited. APN and RS were diagnosed by DMSA scans done within 5 days of UTI and at 6 months respectively. Urine for proteomic study were collected at recruitment. US and MCU were done. Using multiplexing bioassay, 57 cytokines, 14 soluble receptors and 8 kidney markers were measured and data analysed using bioinformatics software. Conclusions: This prospective study of an extended repertoire of urinary proteomes during UTI showed promising results esp.in the prediction of RS which can potentially be translated to clinical application of using urinary proteomes as early non-invasive markers and predictors of renal cortical involvement. Larger cohort studies are needed to test the validity and reproducibility of these biomarkers.",

A urinary proteome pattern publishedby Good et al. was shown to identify adult patients with primary CKD with higher reliability than creatinine based methods. Our study aimed to proof this pattern's reliability in pediatric patients following orthotopic liver transplantation (pOLT). In this population kidney function is usually over-estimated by creatinine based methods due to extreme low muscle mass of the patients. Methods: The urinary proteome patterns of 25 children with biliary atresia followed by pediatric orthotopic liver transplantation were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry and compared to the known proteome pattern of CKD. Cystatin C based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was chosen as comparator. In addition, estimation of creatinine based GFR was also performed in all patients. Results: Thirteen children (f: 7; median age 7.9yrs.; range 0.6 to 15.4) had a reduced cystatin C GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 , 12 patients (f: 7, median age 6.0 yrs., range 2.0 to 11.9) showed no renal impairment. Sensitivity to detect renal impairment using the CKD-pattern was 77% (95% CI 46-95%) and specificity was 92% (95% CI 62-99%). The area under the curve was 0.80 (95% CI 0.59-0.93; p=0.012). Creatinine based estimation of GFR detected only 2/13 patients (15%) correctly resulting in a sensitivity of x %. Using multiple testing corrections, 20 peptides were identified that significantly differentiated patients with renal impairment from those without. Tandem mass spectrometry sequencing revealed 10 fragments of collagen alpha-1(I), 5 of collagen alpha-1(III) and one fragment of collagen alpha-1 (XVI).",

Levels of compliance (0: bad compliance; 1: correct compliance and 2: good compliance) are computed individually for the 17 patients: i) monthly; ii) quarterly; and iii) overall during the first year. Mean compliance scores are summarized quarterly as median, 25 and 75 percentiles, minimum and maximum observed. The \"number of hours covered by cysteamine\" is generated per day. Patients' self-evaluations of compliance are available at each visit. Results: Seventeen patients (mean age: 17.5 years; 58% female) were analyzed. Seven patients were transplanted and 2 under dialysis. eGFR remained stable over time. While WBC cystine levels remained under 1 \u03bcmol/ \u00bd cystine/g protein, there was a great variability among patients and over time in the mean quarterly compliance score (Median: 1.9 at inclusion -1.6 at M12, min = 0.05 -max=2). However, subjects were globally well covered by their study treatment: 22 to 23 hours daily coverage. The compliance scores seemed improved under delayed-release formulation.",

We observed a great variability among compliance profiles, and a trend towards improvement in compliance under delayed-release cysteamine. Objectives: Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation and crystallization of cystine in different cell types. If not treated, renal failure invariably develops within the first decade of life. We have shown excessive number of podocytes and proximal tubular cells in urine of cystinosis patients. Now, we hypothesized that in compensation for cell loss, ongoing regeneration might happen, and it could be reflected by the presence of kidney progenitor cells in urine of the patients. Methods: We quantified the number of kidney progenitor cells in urine using qPCR analysis of mRNA extracted of urine samples of healthy donors (n=10, age range 4-12 y.o) and cystinosis patients (n=8, age range 4-15 y. o). Patients had no kidney graft. The expression of vimentin was correlated to calibration curves derived from known numbers of adult kidney progenitor cells and normalized to volume of urine. We cultured and characterized urinary cystinosis progenitors by qPCR, FACS and immunofluorescence analysis. Later we differentiated progenitor cells into functional podocytes and proximal tubular cells.",

Results: HCAEC express FGFRs and membrane-bound Klotho. FGF23 increases the expression of the Klotho shedding protease ADAM17 and consequently the secretion of soluble Klotho. FGF23 activates FGFR1, and stimulates NO release via Akt-dependent activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Both, ROS formation via NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) as well as ROS degradation via superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT) are stimulated by FGF23 treatment. The effects of FGF23 on NO synthesis as well as on ROS formation and degradation are FGFR-dependent. Pre-incubation with a Klotho inhibitor blunts the FGF23-stimulated Akt-eNOS activation and NO synthesis, decreases ROS degradation by blocking SOD2 and CAT enzymes, whereas FGF23-stimulated ROS synthesis via Nox2 is unaffected, resulting in low NO bioavailability and increased oxidative stress.",

Here, we address this question by pharmacologic blockade/activation of autophagy using in vivo and in vitro model of membranous nephropathy. Methods: We studied female SD rats at day 21 after induction of passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) by injection of anti-Fx1A. Expressions of autophagy markers and apoptosis-associated proteins were analyzed . Confocal microscopy was used to explore the expression patterns of F-actin and nephrin. Attachment assay was used to assess the adhesion of podocyte. Apoptosis and expression of integrin-\u03b13 were measured by flow cytometry. Results: First, autophagy was induced in vivo in podocytes of PHN rats (shown by increased autophagosome number, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and Beclin-1 expression). 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) blocked autophagic flux and worsened renal injury in PHN rats. Compared with control littermates, the 3-MA-treated rats were markedly more sensitive to nephritis as indicated by increased urinary protein excretion, glomerular lesions, and podocyte apoptosis. Subsequently, we utilized immortalized mouse podocytes (MPC5) to study the autophagy mechanisms involved in MN with sC5b-9 incubation in vitro. Podocyte damage, apoptosis and deadhesion were demonstrated in the sC5b-9-incubated MPC5 cells. Furthermore, sC5b-9 induced Beclin-1 and LC3-II expressions and autophagosome formation. Inhibiting autophagy by 3-MA further promoted cellular lesions, apoptosis and actin reorganization-associated deadhesion in the sC5b-9-incubated MPC5 cells. In contrast, rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, promoted Beclin-1 and LC3-II expressions, which mitigated sC5b-9-induced changes in the injury-related morphology, apoptosis, and deadhesion of MPC5 cells. Conclusions: Our results establish a renoprotective role of podocyte autophagy in complement-mediated podocytopathy where it may interfere with cell killing and adhesion mechanisms. Results: Data on 61 children (32 male) from 12 centres were analysed. Shortterm dialysis (<4 weeks) was required in 5 (8%) children (PD in 2, CVVH in 2 and HD in 1) at a median age of 11 (5-16) weeks for a median duration of 16 (8-18) days secondary to sepsis (n=2), acute fluid overload (n=2) or AKI following ACEI (n=1). Thirteen (21%) patients required long-term dialysis by the age of 6 months, 30 (50%) by 1 year, 38 (62%) by 2 years, 41 (67%) by final follow up at a median of 34 months. Of those, 9 (22%) patients did not have nephrectomies, 29 (71%) had nephrectomies before and 3 (7%) after commencingdialysis. In 37 (90%) PD was the modality of choice. Amongst those on PD, CCPD with a day exchange was the commonest prescription (43%). Eleven (30%) patients needed to switch to HD due to PD catheter dysfunction (n=5), peritonitis (n=3), inadequate UF (n=2) or development of pleuro-peritoneal fistula (n=1). Peritonitis rate was 0.95/12 patient months. None developed thrombosis on PD. All patients on HD received 3 sessions of 4 hours per week. No HD line infections and no development of thrombosis were reported. There was no difference in growth between PD and HD patients. Twenty-five patients (61%) received a transplant at a median of 6.5 (0-47) months after start of dialysis of which 15 with living donor.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis for 267 female patients in 173 families who were genetically diagnosed with X-linked Alport syndrome in our department. We analyzed clinical and laboratory data from medical records. The data included proportion of patients with proteinuria and the age at which proteinuria was detected, proportion of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the age at which they reached ESRD, hearing loss and specific ocular changes, genotype-phenotype correlation. We also performed a X-inactivation analysis for the severe patients who reached ESRD before age 60. Results: The median age of our cohort was 24 years (age from 0 to 92 years). Proteinuria was detected in 169 patients (72.2%) and the median age developing proteinuria was 7.0 years. 35 patients reached ESRD and the median renal survival period in this study was 65.0 years and 15% patients reached ESRD at the age of 40. Specific ocular changes were detected in only 4 patients and hearing loss was 17 patients. No obvious genotype-phenotype correlation was observed.

Urological studies are recommended at the time of the first acute pyelonephritis in children of any age. Despite of high prevalence, the treatment is still a discussion. Surgery is curative about 98% of cases, however it is associated with a considerable risk. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent damage is controversy because of low compliance rates and side effects.

The samples with >50 \u03bcg/mL demonstrated <6 % of complement activity in classical and alternative complement pathways. The eculizumab levels had ranges of 36-459 \u03bcg/mL and 40-772 \u03bcg/mL during induction and maintenance phases, respectively, with 3 samples from 2 patients <50 \u03bcg/mL, required for efficient complement inhibition.

Conclusions: Our data demonstrate large differences in attained eculizumab concentrations among patients at all treatment stages. In induction and maintenance, the detected concentrations were up to 9-15 fold higher than required for efficient complement inhibition (50 \u03bcg/mL), although 3 samples did not reach this target value. Thus, eculizumab therapy should be adjusted to meet the needs of individual patients and monitoring of eculizumab concentration is useful to guide the treatment schemes.

Pape (1) Objectives: To describe the long-term outcomes of paediatric patients (pts) with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) treated with eculizumab (Ecu). Methods: Pts with aHUS who participated in a previous Ecu clinical study were invited to continue to be monitored in this observational, multicentre, multinational long-term follow-up study (NCT01522170). This analysis included paediatric pts (<18 years old at first Ecu dose) who enrolled, including pts treated outside of the recommended regimen. Change in renal function and targeted serious adverse events (TSAEs: serious infections, meningococcal infection, sepsis, leukopenia, infusion reactions, renal or hepatic impairment and malignancy) were assessed. Results: Median age at first Ecu dose was 8.0 (range 0-17) years and median follow-up from first Ecu dose was 48.9 (range 35.1-78.5) months (N=35). At least 1 complement abnormality was identified in 21 (60%) pts, including mutations in factor H (9 pts), membrane cofactor protein (3 pts), factor I (2 pts) and C3 (2 pts). Prior to first Ecu dose, 11 (31%) pts were on dialysis and 5 (14%) had prior kidney transplantation. Eight (23%) pts had experienced \u22652 thrombotic microangiopathy events prior to first Ecu dose. Median time from aHUS diagnosis to first Ecu dose was 3.1 (range 0-178.1) months. Improvement in renal function (increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate) following Ecu initiation, was maintained (figure 1), and dialysis was stopped in 9 (82%) pts. Two (18%) pts remained on dialysis throughout the study. No new dialysis or kidney transplants occurred. During this follow-up study, no pts died, 7 (23%) pts experienced a total of 9 TSAEs, including 2 meningococcal infections. Both pts recovered and remained on Ecu.",

Throughout this follow-up period, Ecu was generally well tolerated and effective in paediatric pts. Objectives: Elevated intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels can contribute to morbidity and mortality in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of oral paricalcitol in the reduction of iPTH levels in children with stages 3-5 CKD. Methods: Two phase 3 studies enrolled children aged 10-16 years with stages 3-5 CKD. The first study evaluated oral paricalcitol pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety in children with stage 3/4 CKD with an initial 12-week doubleblind period followed by a 12-week (minimum) open-label period wherein all children received paricalcitol. The second study evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral paricalcitol (no comparator) for 12 weeks in children with stage 5 CKD undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Results: In the stage 3/4 CKD study, 12 children received 3 \u03bcg paricalcitol and were assessed for intensive pharmacokinetics (mean C max , 0.13 ng/mL; AUC 0\u2212\u221e , 2.87 ng\u00e2'h/mL). Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that CKD stage does not influence the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol in children. Thirty-six children were randomized (baseline iPTH, 150 mg/dL) and 27.8% of the paricalcitol group achieved two consecutive iPTH reductions of \u226530% from baseline vs no childrenin the placebo group (P=0.045). Adverse events were observed in a higher proportion of the placebo group compared with the paricalcitol group in the double-blind (88.9% vs 38.9%; P=0.005) portion of the stage 3/4 CKD study. In the stage 5 CKD study, 8 of the 13 (61.5%) children enrolled had two consecutive iPTH reductions of \u226530% from baseline (baseline iPTH, 884 pg/mL, n=13), and 5 (38.5%) had two consecutive iPTH values between 150 and 300 pg/mL. Clinically meaningful hypercalcemia occurred in 2 (15.3%) paricalcitol-treated children in the stage 5 CKD study.",

Methods: A case -control study was performed over 6 months on 33 children with ESRD on regular hemodialysis. They were randomly divided into 3 groups: The first group (11 cases) on regular hemodialysis and received Cinacalcet 30mg/day in addition to conventional care (vitamin D and phosphorus binders) as needed, the second group (13 cases) on hemodiafiltration for at least 6 months and received conventional care only, and the third group (9 cases) [control group] on regular hemodialysis received conventional care only.

The genetic correlations between gene mutations and some of the syndrome, which has VUR phenotype, have been determined in recent years. However, the disease-causing genes of isolated VUR were not well understood yet. Methods: To determine the disease specific genes involving in isolated VUR, the whole exon sequencing (WES) was performed in 37 VUR patients. Of these 37 patients, 28 were isolated VUR.Exon-enriched DNA was sequenced by the Illumina hiseq2500 platform following the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina) . Results: WES data shows 74 mutations (69 novel) in 28 genes in 32 patients (86.5%) from 37 families (Table 1) . These genes include (number of mutations): TNXB (12), TRAP1 (7), KANSL1 (6), RET (6), ROBO2 (6), UPK3A (4), GENE 1(4), XRN1 (3), SALL1 (3), SALL4 (3), BICC1 (2), EYA1 (2), and other 16 genes shows one mutation. Several mutations of RET and HNF1B genes consistent with previously investigation. Further analysis by perniciousness of mutation demonstrated that the mutation of TNXB is significantly correlated with VUR risk stratification. The staging of VUR of patient harboring 4 or above mutations is much higher than the patient harboring 4 or bellowed (OR score is 4) ( Table 2 ). Our findings may provide a clinical molecular marker in VUR for risk stratification. Finally, it is reported that C5orf49 mutation could cause Meckel-Gruber Syndrome. In present study, we identified a run-on mutation were shared by 5 VUR patients out of the 37 patients. Although the MAF in Chinese thousand-genome project is around 4.7%, much higher than western population, it may be a susceptibility gene candidate in Chinese population, which needs to be validated in a larger sample size.",

Repeated UTIs can rarely lead to long-term consequences such as hypertension, preeclampsia, and end stage renal disease. We used a cost-consequence model to evaluate whether the benefits of antimicrobial prophylaxis outweigh its risks, and if so for which subgroups of children prophylaxis may not be cost-effective. Methods: We compared the costs and consequences of antimicrobial prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to no antimicrobial prophylaxis in children aged <6 years diagnosed with VUR grades I-IV after a first or second UTI. We also examined the results in subgroups defined by grade of VUR, presence of bladder bowel dysfunction (BBD), and presence of fever at the time of UTI. Costs and consequences were evaluated over the patient's lifetime. We included the following consequences in our model: hypertension, preeclampsia and end stage renal disease.",

Mild CAKUT was defined as primary VUR grades I-III or isolated hydronephrosis and all other abnormalities were defined as severe CAKUT. Results: 142 boys and 129 girls had at least one imaging study after UTI.

Cystograms were performed in 221 children, of which 83 (37.6%) CAKUTs were detected; 69 primary VURs, 3 posterior urethral valves, 5 neurogenic bladders with VUR and 4 duplex kidneys and 2 urinary tract fistulas. 108 children had a DMSA performed, of which 53 (49.1%) were abnormal, including 30 scarred kidneys, 14 dysplastic kidneys, 4 with dysplasia and scarring in the contralateral kidney, 2 enlarged kidneys, 2 with generalized decreased uptake in one kidney and 1 with a non-functional kidney. Overall, CAKUTs were detected in 148 (54.6%) children of which 43 were severe and 105 were mild.

Metabolic abnormalities commonly predispose urolithiasis and recurrence rates are high, justifying the comprehensive screening of all children. Objectives: We report preliminary observations from a first-in-human clinical trial of ALN-GO1, a subcutaneously administered investigational small interfering RNA therapeutic for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). PH1 is a rare, inherited, life threatening condition characterized by end stage renal disease and multiple end organ damage. The disease results from an inherited defect in the hepatic peroxisomal enzyme, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT), causing an overproduction of the toxic metabolite, oxalate. Currently, liver transplantation provides the only definitive correction of the hepatic metabolic defect. ALN-GO1 is targeted to hepatocytes, where it inhibits glycolate oxidase (GO), an enzyme upstream of AGT, thereby reducing the substrate for oxalate production. In pre-clinical models, treatment with ALN-GO1 has demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the non-toxic metabolite, glycolate, with a corresponding reduction in oxalate excretion, suggesting a potential for therapeutic benefit.",

Patients were followed until CKD (creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/ min/m 2 for 6 months), end stage renal disease (ESRD, initiation of dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant) or last follow-up. Those who received dialysis prior to transplant or were followed <90 days were excluded. Risk of CKD as a function of AKI and other covariates was evaluated in Cox regression models. Results: A total of 304 children were transplanted at a median age of 4.0 years (IQR:0.7-11.9); 55% were male. A total of 88 children developed AKI with a mean of 1.3\u00b10.6 AKI episodes over the first year post-transplant and 24 developed CKD. Less than 5 children developed ESRD, all within 65 days posttransplant and thus were not included in subsequent analysis. In a Cox regression model, those with 1 or more AKI events versus no AKI event by each of the pre-specified time points (3 months, 6 months, 1 year post-transplant) had a significantly greater risk for developing CKD over subsequent follow-up after controlling for age, sex, baseline eGFR. Conclusions: AKI occurs commonly in the first year after transplant and more than 1 episode of AKI is associated with 2-4 times greater risk of developing CKD",

Variants were filtered for the following: (i) rarity; novelty: frequency <1%; absence in 1000 genomes project, ExAC, EVS & in-house databases (ii)disease association: present in HGMD or FH-aHUS databases (iii) reported functional significance (iv) in-silicoprediction of deleteriousness: Phred-CADD >10. Prioritization was as pathogenic & likely pathogenic for variants in 6 genes (CFH, CFI, CFB, C3, CD46 &DGKE) fulfilling 4 and 3 criteria respectively and possibly pathogenic for other variation fulfilling 2 or more criteria. Pathogenic, likely and possibly pathogenic variations in the 6 genes concordant with literature were considered diagnostic. 20 variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. MLPAwas used to detect copy number variation in CFHR1-3. Results: Targeted sequencing at median depth 609X and 95.7% coverage at 20X yielded 264 variants (69 rare/novel, 27 disease-associated, 3 functionally significant, 26 predicted deleterious). One likely pathogenic (CFI), 26 possibly pathogenic and 7 diagnostic variations were identified (figure 1). The median number of likely and possibly pathogenic variations per patient was 2 (range 1-6). The numbers of patients with one & two diagnostic variants was 17 (CD46 13, CFH 2, CFI 1, DGKE 1) and 2 (DGKE & CD46; CFI & CD46 1 each) respectively (57.6% positivity).

Patients aged 6-17 years on HD with stable chronic renal anemia were given C.E.R.A. at a starting dose determined by previous epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin dosing. The initial dose of C.E.R.A. was 4\u03bcg every 4 weeks for each weekly dose of 250IU epoetin alfa/beta or 1.1\u03bcg darbepoetin ('intermediate dose'). After an interim analysis of the first 16 patients showed that this starting dose did not maintain hemoglobin (Hb) in the target range (10-12g/dL), the starting dose was doubled to 4\u03bcg for each weekly dose of 125IU epoetin alfa/beta or 0.55\u03bcg darbepoetin ('high dose'). Results: 64 patients have been enrolled (16 intermediate/48 high dose), with 48 evaluable for efficacy (12 and 36, respectively). Most withdrawals were due to renal transplantation. In the intermediate and high dose groups respectively, the mean ages were 11 and 13 years, and 69% and 48% were male. In the high dose group, adjusted mean change in Hb between evaluation and baseline was -0.09g/dL (95% CI -0.45, 0.26). Results were consistent across age groups(6- 11, 12-17 years)  and previous type of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. Hb concentrations over time in response to adjusted doses of C.E.R.A. were stable. In the high dose group 29/36 patients (81%) maintained Hb within 10-12g/dL, 27 (75%) maintained Hb within 1g/dL of baseline, and 25 (69%) fulfilled both criteria. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile for C.E.R.A. in adults Conclusions: Pediatric patients on HD with stable anemia of CKD can be switched from maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin to C.E.R.A., using a defined conversion factor for the starting dose of C.E.R.A.

Chen, A.V.D. Ven, A. Vivante, N. Mann, S. Shril, J. Schulz, H. Ityel, F. Hildebrandt Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United StatesObjectives: Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in children. Knowledge from animal models suggests that single gene mutations in genes governing kidney and urinary tract development may lead to CAKUT in humans. However, the genetic pathogenesis of human CAKUT remains mostly elusive. Methods: To identify novel monogenic causes of CAKUT we applied homozygosity mapping with whole exome sequencing (WES) in consanguineous families with CAKUT. We performed a electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA),Dual-Luciferase reporter assay, as well as migration assay to identify the function of mutant. Results: We identified a homozygous missense mutation (p.Arg415His) of the Ets Variant Gene 4 (ETV4) in a consanguineous family with isolated CAKUT. We showed that the R415H mutant abrogated its DNA binding affinity by using EMSA, as measured by luciferase assay in HEK293 cells, and altered migration effert for ETV4, resulting in migration defect.Conclusions: We identified a ETV4 mutation as causing human CAKUT via lack of induction of ETV4 transcriptional activity and subsequent affect the migration in R415H mutant cells.

The aims of this study were to determine the outcome of kidneys declined for paediatric recipients and establish renal allograft survival in kidneys that were eventually transplanted. Methods: Data from the UK Transplant Registry were collected for all kidneys offered and declined for paediatric recipients under 18 years of age from 2009 to 2014. The eventual outcome of declined kidneys was recorded, as well as three-year renal allograft survival in those kidneys that were eventually transplanted. The outcome for children who had a kidney declined on their behalf was also analysed. Results: 615 kidneys were available for transplantation from donors initially declined for kidney transplantation to 204 different paediatric recipients. 82% of the 615 declined kidneys were eventually transplanted, 7% of kidneys went to paediatric recipients and 62% of kidneys went to adult recipients.

Licht The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, CanadaObjectives: Complement dysregulation on endothelial cells causes EC activation/injury and leads to thrombotic microangiopathy. Different from previous concepts, our data demonstrate that complement dysregulation does not result in EC death. The current study focuses on EC complement evasion strategies, especially plasma membrane (PM) repair. We particularly focused on von Willebrand Factor (VWF), a protein stored in EC Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB), which we recently identified as new complement regulator on ECs. Methods: Complement activation on ECs was induced via sensitization on blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from healthy controls and patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) lacking both VWF and their storage WPBs. FM1-43X dye and calcein release were used to determine PM integrity. Results: Complement activation resulted in PM insertion of C5b-9 pores in control and VWD BOECs resulting in rapid Ca 2+ influx. In response, VWF was recruited to the EC surface via WPBs merging with the PM and releasing VWF multimers within 30-60 min. Importantly, control but not VWD BOECs resealed their PM within 30 min. In control BOECs known cellular mechanisms for PM repair (endocytosis, lysosomal recruitment) were not critically involved in PM repair. Conclusions: PM repair is a major strategy of ECs to overcome complementmediated injury. Our study indicates a new mechanism: Ca 2+ -dependent VWF recruitment to the EC surface resulting in complement regulation and EC PM repair via WPBs. The understanding of the detailed mechanism warrants further investigation.",
