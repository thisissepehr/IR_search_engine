While hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is well known as a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis, the role of muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (Fbp2) in glucose disposal and thermogenesis is unknown. Here, using Fbp2 knockout (KO) mice, we assessed the physiological role of Fbp2 in energy and glucose metabolism and thermogenesis. In vivo assessments of energy metabolism, glucose metabolism, and thermogenesis were performed by indirect calorimetry, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and cold challenge studies, respectively. Under both feeding and fasting conditions, Fbp2 KO mice showed similar phenotypes regarding energy and glucose metabolism compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, Fbp2 KO mice were severely intolerant to cold challenge under fasting conditions. Mechanistically, the cold-induced intramuscular conversion of lactate to glycogen (glyconeogenesis) is completely abolished in the KO muscle, which leads to a lack of glycogen source for thermogenesis in Fbp2 KO mice. The cold-intolerant phenotype of KO mice disappeared after feeding, and the KO mice were equally as cold tolerant as the WT mice and survived during the cold challenge for three weeks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Fbp2 is essential for muscle thermogenesis by replenishing the intramuscular glycogen pool through glyconeogenesis when the exogenous glucose source is limited. These data imply the physiological importance of Fbp2 in thermal homeostasis and suggest a potential novel therapy targeted to increase glycogen replenishment upon cold stress.",

A large body of research has been focused on muscle contraction, growth, and exercise performance due to its relevance to health and metabolic disorders 3 ; however, these studies have placed less emphasis on the role of skeletal muscle in regulating body temperature and metabolism. Generally, it has been assumed that heat production and metabolic activity in skeletal muscle are primarily caused by contractile activity because muscle shivering is recruited as the first line of defense during acute exposure to cold 4 . Shivering is a repetitive contraction-relaxation process that is activated by repeated stimulation of the neuromuscular junction that leads to an elevation of cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration, thereby activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to produce heat 3 . During shivering, heat is primarily produced by the major ATP-utilizing enzymes, including Na + /K + ATPase, myosin ATPase, and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase 5, 6 . Lipids provide most of the heat during low-intensity shivering, whereas carbohydrates become dominant under more extreme cold conditions 7 . The contribution from plasma glucose always remains minor; however, muscle glycogen plays an important role during intense shivering 7 . Although acute increases in exogenous glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis by insulin primarily maintain muscle glycogen size 8 , the glycogen pool can be replenished from 3-carbon units, such as lactate, named glyconeogenesis 9, 10 . However, whether the size of the muscle glycogen stores influences cold tolerance as well as the physiological importance of glyconeogenesis remain to be demonstrated.",

            "text": "In mammals, there are liver and muscle isotypes of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp), encoded by two separate genes, Fbp1 and Fbp2. The Fbp1 gene is mainly expressed in gluconeogenic organs, such as the liver and kidneys, and is the regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis 11 . Fbp1 plays a key role in hepatic gluconeogenesis. In animal models, the inhibition of Fbp1 markedly inhibits gluconeogenesis and increases glucose sensitivity and utilization 12 . In humans, Fbp1 deficiency caused by Fbp1 mutations decreases gluconeogenesis 13 and leads to hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis during fasting 14, 15 , and unexpected infant death 16 . In contrast, the Fbp2 gene is expressed in nongluconeogenic organs and was identified in striated muscle by Krebs and Woodford in 1965 17 . In skeletal muscle, Fbp2 catalyzes the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate 18 and is located in the middle of the glyconeogenesis and glycolytic pathways. Several studies have attempted to clarify the physiological meaning of Fbp2, which is distinguished from the gluconeogenic isotype Fbp1. A hypothesis was proposed by Newsholme in 1976 that the futile cycle between fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate mediated by Fbp2 could regulate whole-body thermal homeostasis 18 . Furthermore, the activity of Fbp2 has been known to be increased by cold challenge 19 as well as translocated to the mitochondria by glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibition 20,21 , suggesting its role in thermogenesis. However, whether Fbp2 directly contributes to muscle thermogenesis in vivo and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. A study using Fbp2 knockout (KO) animals has not been reported, and there is limited clinical evidence that Fbp2 deficiency is associated with benign nonprogressive myopathy in humans 22 . Thus, it is a testable hypothesis as to whether Fbp2 may affect intramuscular glycolysis, glyconeogenesis, or mitochondrial respiration, each of which could contribute to energy metabolism and thermogenesis. Here, we performed comprehensive studies using Fbp2 KO and littermate control (wild-type: WT) mice to identify the role of Fbp2 in energy and glucose metabolism and thermal homeostasis in vivo.",

Although Fbp2 mRNA was broadly expressed in various nongluconeogenic tissues, including white and brown adipose tissues (Fig. 1a) , the protein expression of Fbp2 was highly specific to muscle tissues and was not detectable in the liver and adipose tissues (Fig. 1b) . In particular, the type 2 fiber abundant extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle showed higher Fbp2 gene and protein expression than the type 1 fiber abundant soleus muscle (Fig. 1b, c) , which is consistent with previous findings of higher Fbp2 activity in white muscle than in red muscle 29 . Fbp2 gene expression was nondetectable in Fbp2 KO mice (Fig. 1c) . Fbp2 KO mice showed slight but significantly lower body weight than WT mice, which was mostly accounted for by decreased lean body mass, as measured by 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Fig. 1d) . Indeed, the weight of several skeletal muscles was significantly reduced in KO mice compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 1e) , and the decreased muscle mass was associated with reduced locomotor activity during the comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system study (Fig. 1f, g) . Despite the significantly decreased body weight, Fbp2 KO mice showed reductions in oxygen consumption (VO 2 , Fig. 1h , i), carbon dioxide production (VCO 2 , Fig. 1j, k) , and energy expenditure (Supplementary Fig. 1b) during the fasting period (light cycle, Fig. 1h, j) . The respiratory exchange ratio and food intake were identical between Fbp2 KO and WT mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1a, c) . There was no difference in energy expenditure at the feeding period between WT and Fbp2 KO mice, inferring a specific role of Fbp2 deletion on energy metabolism when the exogenous fuel supply was limited.",

There was no difference in insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose utilization between Fbp2 KO and WT mice, as reflected by the identical glucose infusion rates needed to maintain euglycemia during the steady state (Fig. 2a, b) . Hepatic glucose production (HGP) under basal conditions (Fig. 2c ) and the suppression of HGP by insulin, which indicates hepatic insulin sensitivity, were not different between Fbp2 KO and WT mice (Fig. 2d) . Insulinstimulated whole-body glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis rates also showed no differences between WT and Fbp2 KO mice (Fig. 2e) . Consistently, skeletal muscle-specific glucose uptake measured by 2-deoxy-D-[1-14 C]-glucose was identical between WT and Fbp2 KO mice (Fig. 2f) . We performed further hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies under highfat-fed conditions. There was no difference in glucose fluxes between WT and KO mice during the clamp study ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).

Thus, we further tested the role of Fbp2 in thermogenesis under more severe glycogenolytic conditions by challenging Fbp2 KO mice with both cold and fasting. After 6 h of cold exposure without food, Fbp2 KO mice exhibited more severe cold intolerance than WT mice, and most of the KO mice had to be euthanized after 10 h of cold exposure due to the humane concern of severe hypothermia (Fig. 3a) . Fbp2 KO mice showed significantly decreased glycogen content in their tibialis anterior (Fig. 3b) compared to KO mice after cold exposure. We also further tested whether glycogenolysis was accelerated by Fbp2 deletion by measuring the muscle glycogen content at various time points after the cold challenge. Consistent with the decreased body temperature patterns (Fig. 3a) , the muscle glycogen content was significantly reduced after 6 h of cold exposure (Fig. 3c) in both WT and KO mice.

Thus, both at room temperature and after 6 h of cold challenge, we conducted experiments using a radioisotope-labeled tracer ( 14 C(U)-lactate) to quantitatively measure the incorporation of lactate into glycogen in the skeletal muscle of WT and Fbp2 KO mice (Fig. 4a) .

These results imply that intramuscular glyconeogenesis exists even at room temperature. Since the subthermoneutral temperature of mice is~30\u00b0C, room temperature (~22\u00b0C) could contribute to the decrease in muscle glycogen content in KO muscle (Fig. 3b) . Furthermore, after 6 h of cold challenge, glyconeogenesis was markedly induced by~206% in the WT mouse muscle, whereas it remained blocked entirely in the muscle of the Fbp2 KO mice (Fig. 4b) , implying a more critical role of Fbp2 under cold conditions. Consistent with the EDL muscle results in Fbp2 KO mice, intramuscular glycogen replenishment was significantly decreased in the tibialis anterior (TA) and quadriceps (QD) muscles of Fbp2 KO mice after acute cold challenge compared to WT mouse muscles (Fig. 4c) . Furthermore, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Fbp2 transgenic mice, we measured the in vitro glycogen content after cold-mimicking stimulation (isoproterenol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist). Consequently, the glycogen content was decreased by isoproterenol in WT MEFs but maintained in Fbp2overexpressing MEFs (Fig. 4d, e) , indicating the preservation of glycogen by Fbp2-mediated glyconeogenesis. Furthermore, we investigated whether other heat sources, such as mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial respiratory function, were affected by Fbp2 deletion in WT and KO mice. The cold challenge itself significantly increased the expression of the Pgc-1\u03b1 gene both in brown adipose tissue and gastrocnemius (GAS) muscle; however, there was no significant difference between genotypes ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) . After the cold challenge, Ucp3 protein expression was identical between WT and KO mouse muscle, dissociating muscle mitochondrial uncoupling from the cold-intolerant phenotype of KO muscle ( Supplementary Fig. 3b, right) . The expression of Pgc-1\u03b1 mRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 3a , left) and Ucp1 protein ( Supplementary Fig. 3b , left) in brown adipose tissues showed increasing trends in KO mice after cold challenge, which was likely a compensatory response to the decreased body temperature in the Fbp2 KO mice. Accordingly, the expression of mitochondria-related genes in the GAS muscle ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ) and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate with isolated mitochondria from GAS muscle were unchanged (Fig. 4f) . However, with primary cultured myoblasts from the WT and Fbp2 KO mouse muscles, cellular oxygen consumption rates were significantly decreased in KO mouse myoblasts (Fig. 4g) , which was consistent with the decreased whole-body V O2 and V CO2 rates in the indirect calorimetry study (Fig. 1h, j) . These data suggest that Fbp2 affects thermogenesis mainly by regulating the intracellular glycogen content rather than directly changing mitochondrial function or other thermoregulatory pathways.",

            "text": "The physiological meaning of intramuscular glyconeogenesis has been questioned for over a decade since skeletal muscle mainly replenishes glycogen from exogenous glucose 31, 32 or via liver gluconeogenesis, named Cori cycling 33 . Indeed, when the oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intensive exercise, lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis in the muscles moves to the liver and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles 34 . We do not doubt that Cori cycling is the major pathway for preventing lactic acidosis in muscle and further drives additional glycolysis reactions via NAD + generation for most physiological conditions, including fasting and exercise. However, it is not clear whether intramuscular glyconeogenesis is an alternative pathway for replenishing muscle glycogen under specific conditions, such as cold exposure. Furthermore, we questioned why muscle chooses the energetically inefficient method of glycogen replenishment because gluconeogenesis via the liver requires more ATP consumption than glyconeogenesis in skeletal muscle, which bypasses the hexokinase step. In the present study, we discovered that acute cold challenge dramatically induced glyconeogenesis in the EDL muscle of WT mice (Fig. 4b) without increasing the muscle lactate concentration (data not shown). This suggested that muscle glyconeogenesis could have a critical contribution to muscle glycogen replenishment after cold challenge, which might mimic aerobic glycogenolytic conditions. Moreover, in the present study, we found the physiological importance of Fbp2 in the thermal homeostasis of the whole-body under acute cold stress and demonstrated intramuscular glyconeogenesis as an underlying mechanism of thermogenesis. These findings support an old hypothesis by Holloszy in 1979 9 , which stated that the existence of intramuscular glyconeogenesis and the involvement of Fbp2 in this pathway might contribute to glycogen replenishment from endogenous carbon sources. However, whether lactate can be resynthesized to carbohydrates in skeletal muscle under physiological conditions is controversial, and the physiological role of Fbp2 has been unclear for two decades [35] [36] [37] . This is likely due to the following three reasons. First, the majority of previous studies focused on exercise conditions 9,10,38 , where most lactate was oxidized by the mitochondria rather than converted to glycogen due to the increased ATP demand after physical activity. Second, previous studies have focused on glycogen synthesis with exogenous glucose supply 31, 32 . Therefore, it might be difficult to investigate the role of intramuscular glyconeogenesis in skeletal muscle glycogen metabolism. Third, experimental evidence supporting this concept 9,10,38,39 has never been conducted under the in vivo condition of Fbp2 deficiency. We believe that the most important experimental design of our study that differentiated it from previous studies was the cold challenge without exogenous glucose supply. First, in the present study, we found that Fbp2 KO mice exhibited decreased whole-body energy metabolism only during the light phase when food intake was minimized. Second, we used the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique to mimic the feeding state, which demonstrated that there was no difference in exogenous glucose uptake between Fbp2 WT and KO mice. Third, under fasting conditions, Fbp2 KO mice were cold intolerant and severely hypothermic after the acute cold challenge. However, when food was supplied, the Fbp2 KO mice survived well without any decreases in body temperature even after 3 weeks of the cold challenge. Consequently, these results indicate that intramuscular glyconeogenic flux is crucial for the maintenance of the endogenous glycogen pool and muscle thermogenesis.",

First, we assumed that the fructose futile cycling rate would be affected by the decreased glyconeogenesis in the Fbp2 KO mice, but we could not provide any in vivo flux data for the futile cycling rate in the Fbp2 KO muscle due to the technical limitations of the tracer methods. Future studies with a new isotope tracer methodology may provide more direct evidence for futile thermogenesis. Second, there are further questions that need to be addressed in future studies regarding whether the present findings of this study can be extended to clinical interpretation in humans. Although we focused on the relationship between cold tolerance and intramuscular glyconeogenesis, the physiological role of Fbp2 may be extended to other conditions where skeletal muscle glycogen breakdown replenishment is increased. We demonstrated in the present study that Fbp2 is closely related to the endogenous glucose source of skeletal muscle; therefore, further experiments with aerobic exercise or prolonged fasting could provide clinical insight into Fbp2 in various physiological conditions.",

After the tissue was digested and became a fine slurry, cell culture media based on Ham's F-10 (LM009-01, Welgene, Daegu, Korea) supplemented with 20% v/v FBS (S001-07, Welgene, Daegu, Korea) and 25 \u03bcg/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (2.5 ng/mL for final concentration, F0291, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were added to inactivate collagenase and dispase activity. Next, large clumps and debris were removed through a cell strainer (352350, Falcon, Corning, NY, USA). The whole mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 350 \u00d7 g, and the pellet was resuspended in cell culture media. Finally, myoblasts were (sub)cultured in type 1 collagen-coated dishes (39006, 21100, 21150, SPL, Pochon, Korea) until a sufficient number of cells was reached.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from mouse embryos (E13.5-15.5) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v FBS and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. For the in vitro cold stress-mimicking study, 1 \u03bcM isoproterenol (I5627, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was treated for 4 h in serum-free conditions maintained in low-glucose DMEM (LM001-11, Welgene, Daegu, Korea).",
