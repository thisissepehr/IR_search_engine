Fuzzy models based on differential equations have been proposed by Pearson (1997) , Seikkala (1987) , and Nikravesh et al. (2004) . However, this approach is difficult to apply in epidemiology due to the fact that epidemic models have, in general, strong non-linearities. In order to incorporate the heterogeneities in ecological and epidemiological models, Barros et al. considered fuzzy parameters in differential equations (Barros et al., 2000 Jafelice et al., 2004) , whose solution could be found by calculating the fuzzy expected value whenever the variables have a probabilistic distribution. Although these models consist in a significant contribution to the field, applying them is not an easy task. An alternative approach for fuzzy epidemic models based on dynamical linguistic models has been proposed (Ortega et al., 2000 . However, these gradual rules systems present important limitations, as the explosion of the number of the rules and the difficulties of the experts to model the consequents if many input variables are considered . In this context, any new approach of fuzzy dynamic model applied in epidemiology can represent an important contribution for both fuzzy logic and epidemiology.",

These attempts consist in macroscopic epidemic models, where the heterogeneity was given by the stratification of the population into subgroups, considering homogeneous mixing within the subgroups. The subgroups are closed and the level of infectivity and susceptibility are assumed as constant throughout the epidemic course. Recently, Menezes et al. (2004) proposed a Reed-Frost generalization from a microscopic point of view, in which the uncertainty involved in the diagnostic classification is modeled through a stochastic process and based on individual's information. Menezes et al. considered studies involving small groups, within which both homogeneous mixing and homogeneous susceptibility were maintained. The epidemic course depends on the clinical signals involved both in the classification process and to define the probability of an infectious contact. These clinical signals may include symptoms, results of laboratorial and physical exams. It is assumed that no resistance is gained and the individual becomes susceptible again, after being infected. They consider the model in the context of both retrospective, in which the patient's health status are observable and modeled as random variables, and prospective studies, in which these true health status are not known. In order to explore the role of the classification process in this epidemic model, we present in this paper a fuzzy approach for the Menezes et al. Reed-Frost generalized model, taking into account the vagueness of the diagnostic process instead of the stochastic uncertainty. We developed a microscopic epidemic model based on the clinical signals and consider a fuzzy relation to evaluate the individual's infectiousness, performing a fuzzy decision process where the infectiousness degree is applied directly into the epidemic dynamic.",

Thus, it is assumed that the higher the signal values, the higher the probability that a contact between an infected and a susceptible individual be infectious. The model allows the inclusion of both signals linked to increased and to decreased infectiousness. Furthermore, distinct signals can affect the probability p with different intensity and ways, affecting also the classification process. So, the calculation of the probability p assumes an important role in this approach, since the individual's information is transmitted to the population dynamics through it.",

In the former, all signals information related to the possibility function can be performed through fuzzy relational matrix, while in the latter it should be done through the probabilistic function. Clearly, from the interdisciplinary point of view, it is easier to understand the fuzzy relational approach than the mathematical formalism of polynomial functions. In the same way, the heterogeneity of susceptible individuals can be more easily performed in the fuzzy structure. It can be made simply by considering a fuzzy relational matrix that cross information about the immunological characteristics (as information about the child's history, family and personal antecedents, breastfeeding, re-infections, etc.) and the degree of susceptibility for the infection. In this sense, the fuzzy relational matrix can supply a fuzzy measure of the individual's protection for certain infections, taking into account the aspects of the identification uncertainties, commonly present in a real epidemic process. In addition, both fuzzy measures for the susceptibility and infectiousness degree can be elaborated based on the experts opinion.",
