A generalised view was the most common (30 %), with 55 articles (16.8 %) focused specifically on low and middleincome countries (LMICs). This reflects the high number of meta-analysis and review articles that used data from across countries, rather than from a single country. Eight articles (2.4 %) examined or contrasted between low-income and high-income countries. Canada was the most frequently cited country (2.4 %), with research primarily focused on the reasons for, and policies surrounding, medical tourism [3, 4] . Table 2 , Column A presents the 20 key thematic categories identified from the analysis, as described above. The first six of these (health systems, pharmaceuticals, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, research, policy-making and migration) were considered particularly 'rich' as they contained six or more subthemes. A second tier of thematic categories, each with 3 or 4 sub-themes included health technologies, international aid, and global health as an area of study, partnerships and knowledge sharing, nutrition, mental health and global threats. A third set of thematic categories although less 'rich' in terms of the range of sub-themes, included many areas critical for global health, such as tobacco control, maternal health and the health and rights of sex workers. Whilst the above analysis is useful insofar as it maps the broad range of topics published by the journal, we further reviewed these thematic categories in the context of an existing framework for globalisation and health.
