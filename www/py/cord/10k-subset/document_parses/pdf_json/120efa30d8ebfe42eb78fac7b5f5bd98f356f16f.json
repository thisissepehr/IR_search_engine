Self-management refers to possessing the skills to carry out medical regimens and health behaviour changes to control a disease and live as functional a life as possible. A Cochrane review demonstrated that self-management plans in COPD produced statistically significant improvements in quality of life and a lower probability of all cause hospitalisations 1 . The NICE COPD Guidelines recommend selfmanagement plans that encourage patients to respond promptly to symptoms of exacerbations 2 . We evaluated if COPD patients had a self-management plan, including the use of a rescue prescription, and how confident they were in independently implementing this plan. Thirty COPD patients (mean FEV 1 55%) were assessed in an outpatient department. 60% (n=18) of patients had a self-management plan in place.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 529, "end": 530, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welcome from the Local Organisers"}, {"text": "The main triggers for activating their plan were sputum (55%), breathlessness (28%) and a cough (17%). 83% of patients followed up with their GP as soon as possible after commencing a rescue prescription, and 89% reported feeling very confident to initiate their self-management plan independently. Healthcare professionals involved with COPD patients should continue to include self-management plans as part of the ongoing treatment of the condition, and should also consider the suitability of patients for rescue prescriptions for prompt management of exacerbations. University of Groningen, The Netherlands Understanding individual adherence behaviours may inform the development of effective patient-specific interventions to reduce COPD-related costs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welcome from the Local Organisers"}, {"text": "Inhaler adherence was remotely monitored in 226 COPD patients, for 90 days following hospital discharge. Cluster analysis grouped patients by adherence behaviour based on habit of use and critical technique error rate. Variations in patient characteristics and rates of adverse clinical outcomes at 12 months were analysed. The cost-utility of enhancing adherence was estimated. Four adherence clusters were identified:Cluster 1(Regular habit;Good technique,28%) had the lowest probability of any event(5.46/person). Cluster 2(Regular habit;Poor technique,21%) had the lowest rate of hospital presentation, but the highest community exacerbation treatment(4.6/ person). This group had evidence of increased hyperinflation. Cluster 3(Poor habit;Good technique,32%) had the greatest probability of any event,Hazard Ratio 1.8(1.1-2.9), p=0.02(vs.Cluster 1), and were notable for high anxiety scores. Cluster 4(Poor habit;Poor technique,19%) was older, majority female, with higher co-morbidity and greater cognitive impairment, and experienced the highest mortality, 33%,p<0.001. In a cost-effectiveness model, a targeted adherence behaviour intervention would result in additional QALYs gained, for each cluster, at reasonable investment. Notably, in Cluster 3, intervention would even be costsaving. Personalised interventions targeting specific adherence behaviours may prove a cost-effective strategy to curtail COPD-related healthcare costs. We examined which components have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes. Adherence to management guidelines was examined in 208 hospitalised COPD patients. We assessed 1)Arterial blood gas measurement, 2)Administration of Controlled Oxygen therapy, 3)Regular short-acting bronchodilator therapy, 4)Prescription of systemic steroids (oral if suitable) and 5)Prescription of appropriate antibiotics, where applicable. Hospital length of stay (LOS) and readmissions up to 90 days following discharge were recorded. The majority of exacerbations were low risk, median DECAF score of 1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welcome from the Local Organisers"}, {"text": "The median LOS was 8 days; 80% were discharged directly to home.

Suggestions for improvement have been evaluated to improve overall patient experience. Background: An audit in January 2017 highlighted care delivered to patients requiring Bi-PAP at Beaumont Hospital was fragmented and often provided by non-specialist teams. Only 44% of cases were referred to the Respiratory Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNSp) service. A Bi-PAP integrated care pathway was developed to standardise care. Aim: To explore the role of the Respiratory CNSp in the implementation of a Bi-PAP Pathway Intervention: As part of the pathway, the Respiratory CNSp carried out a daily assessment of patients on Bi-PAP. Nursing staff were guided on best practice and cases were discussed with the Respiratory Specialist Registrar (SpR) on a daily basis. Audit: A retrospective review of Respiratory CNSp notes highlighted recurrent themes in relation to our interventions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welcome from the Local Organisers"}, {"text": "Results: 82% of patients commenced on Bi-PAP (n=25) over a 3 month period were reviewed by the Respiratory CNSp. 66% required interventions to promote best practice. Interventions observed-titration of O2 therapy (34%); air driven nebulisation (27%); correction in machine set-up (10%); transfer to a High Dependency bed (8%) and Respiratory Registrar re-involvement (32%) Conclusion: The Respiratory CNSp expertise plays a pivotal role in the success of a Bi-PAP pathway through early and continuous review, prompt intervention and close consultation with Respiratory SpR and multidisciplinary teams. Exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma remains one of the most common presentations to emergency department and hospital admissions. In recent years with addition of wide range of inhalers, make it a cumbersome process to remember correct inhaler doses, device types and frequency of use. We conducted a review of drug kardex to assess adherence with inhaler prescriptions. A review of inpatient medical kardex in five medical wards in Tallaght hospital were carried out and all inhaler prescription details were collected including the documentation of dosage, device type and frequency. Out of 130 prescriptions reviewed, 40 patients were on at least one inhaler. Out of 52 inhalers prescribed, ellipta and evohaler devices were commonly used. Twelve patients were prescribed with more than one inhaler. A good compliance was found in documenting frequency of use of the inhaler (96%) followed by actual dosage of the drug (82%). Only 46% had correct documentation of the inhaler device type. This is not surprising with the new range of inhaler devices is available currently. We recommend displaying of a poster containing details of inhalers with dosage, device types and frequency, in all medical wards so that the prescriptions can be made easy. Comorbidities of variable severity are commonly associated with COPD, including cognitive impairment. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD patients and the, specific cognitive domains with the greatest deficits were evaluated. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was performed on 213 hospitalised patients with COPD. MoCA is a validated screening tool for the detection of cognitive impairment. The MoCA assesses multiple cognitive domains including visuospatial/executive skills, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction and orientation. The cohort was 50% male with a mean age of 71. The majority had moderate to very severe COPD (81%). The mean MoCA score was 22, consistent with mild cognitive impairment, and below that from an aged matched normal population sample (mean 26). Only 13% achieved a normal score MoCA score. Deficits were found across all domains but particularly in memory & visuospatial/executive skills. There was no significant association between disease severity (GOLD stage) and the prevalence of cognitive impairment. In summary, cognitive impairment is prevalent in COPD and will likely impact on patient's ability to understand and follow disease management plans. Evaluation of cognition should therefore form part of the routine assessment of these patients. The multidisciplinary Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU) at St. James's Hospital, provides a range of services for persons with chronic lung disease. In 2016, a quality improvement (QI) team was formed comprising RAU team members and two QI coachesin-training, in the context of a 'ground-up' approach to healthcare improvement within the Hospital using the Dartmouth College USA Clinical Microsystems\" QI approach 1 . During weekly meetings with coaches, a framework of assessing, diagnosing and treating the RAU \"microsystem\" was utilised. This ultimately led to identification of a theme (\"Access\") -and a global aim statement: to increase the number of patients referred to the respiratory outreach programme by 20% within an eight month period. Change ideas to achieve this aim included increased presence of RAU staff in the ED, contacting medical registrar on call at start of each shift, daily education huddle with ED/medical unit staff. Small changes were tested regularly using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. There was a 137% increase in referrals made and a 33% increase in the number of referrals accepted to the respiratory outreach programme over the 8 months compared to the same period in 2015/2016. Staff were provided with a framework to address quality improvement in the service on an ongoing basis. LTOT (long-term oxygen therapy) offers a survival benefit to patients with COPD who meet established criteria. Many patients may be prescribed oxygen inappropriately. Our aim was to establish which hospitals in Ireland are running oxygen clinics and to compare oxygen prescription in hospitals to a guideline standard. We sent an online questionnaire and followed up by phone to representatives in Irish hospitals in which domiciliary oxygen is prescribed. We obtained responses from thirty-two of forty hospitals (80%).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3613, "end": 3614, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An integrated care pathway for managing Bi-level Positive"}, {"text": "Twelve hospitals (38%) had a dedicated oxygen assessment clinic while twenty (62%) did not. Centres without oxygen clinics primarily prescribed oxygen from in-patient wards following an inpatient stay. Eight of the twenty-three hospitals with no oxygen clinic had no formal follow up in place for patients on home oxygen, while other centres followed patients in general and respiratory clinics. In thirteen centres oxygen was prescribed by non-respiratory clinicians. Centres with oxygen clinics met criteria for initial assessment and oxygen prescription, however titration of oxygen and general follow up did not meet guideline recommendations. Due to a lack of dedicated oxygen assessment and review services, many Irish patients are not optimally treated with domiciliary oxygen. Oxygen prescribing in Ireland requires increased resources in order to facilitate guideline-based treatment. The prevalence of obesity in adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma is up to 40%. It has been associated with increased dyspnoea, exercise limitation and decreased lung-function. A multidisciplinary approach was employed to develop a semi-structured group weight management programme. Sixteen adults with a BMI \u226530kg/m 2 and asthma/ COPD completed the programme. Participants attended physiotherapy and dietetics (for a total of 2 hours) once a week for 8 weeks, with follow up at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel using paired sample t tests. Results are displayed in Table 1 . Statistically significant improvements were obtained in weight, BMI, waist circumference, self reported health status and six minute walking test results. There were also reductions in self reported anxiety and depression scores. Twelve month follow up data will be collected in August 2017. This programme has demonstrated significant quantative health-related positive outcomes. Participants also reported benefits beyond those measured, including feeling \"listened to\", \"helped us help ourselves\" and improved peer to peer support. Given the prevalence of obesity in this population this programme may be of benefit to many more adults in Ireland. The aim of this study was to observe adherence rates with inhaled medication in COPD patients and assess their knowledge of their inhalers, inhaler technique, understand their perception of their disease, which healthcare professional had previously educated each patient and was inhaler use in line with the 2016 GOLD guidelines. There is paucity within research on the adherence levels of inhaled medication within the COPD group in Ireland. This study was conducted in the Mid West region encompassing all hospitals in the hospital group of Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh. A total of fifty participants were assessed. These participants attended the Respiratory clinics for their routine appointment. The assessment encompassed whether patients knew what condition they were taking their various inhalers for, in this case it was COPD; on who did the inhaler assessment i.e. respiratory nurse, pharmacy, physiotherapist, GP. It also looked at the classification of COPD patients and the inhalers they were on and whether stable or not.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1528, "end": 1535, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "An integrated care pathway for managing Bi-level Positive"}, {"text": "Within the sample a significant number of participants were non-adherent with inhaled medication. There was a strong correlation with adherence and correct technique with patients that were previously assessed (n=86%) and of these a significant number had been educated by respiratory nurses (n=76%). Of those previously assessed only 32% required medication change as per GOLD guidelines due to poor disease control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An integrated care pathway for managing Bi-level Positive"}, {"text": "This study highlights that regular contact with a healthcare professional, especially Respiratory Clinical Nurse Specialists, who can focus on COPD patient's disease and inhaled medication, and encourage adherence and add or remove therapy if no longer needed would reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life of these patients. The high rate of readmission of COPD patients has been highlighted on both a national and international level (1). According to a recent European COPD audit, Ireland's readmission rate was reported to be the highest of all the other European countries audited (1) . Claims about the degree to which readmissions are preventable have become the subject of much debate (2) . The aim of the project is to review patients who are have an unplanned readmission with a COPD exacerbation in order to identify gaps in patient care (i.e. assessment on admission, treatment, discharge and follow-up) and to develop recommendations for a care bundle. The first phase of the project involves a consultation process across the MDT, a review of existing local, national and international guidelines. Following this, an e-Delphi method is used to engage with national and international experts to develop a tool for retrospectively reviewing charts of patients with an unplanned readmission within 90-days following a COPD exacerbation over a one year period. The e-Delphi process is a structured method for developing consensus on an issue. The process of establishing a straight forward chart review has highlighted a number of issues including bringing the MDT together and the importance of having a researcher working with the team. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a 52kDa anti-protease, protecting the lungs from the harmful effects of proteases. Without this protection emphysema can develop and there are over 100 AAT mutations that cause AAT deficiency, 30 of these are nonsense mutations. The null bolton (qbt-AAT) arises from a frameshift mutation causing a truncated AAT protein of 49kDa, resulting in non-detectable AAT levels. Ataluren is a drug that has been shown to cause read-through of nonsense mutations. Our aim was to treat qbt-AAT producing cells with ataluren to restore production of the full sized protein (MM-AAT). Induced pluripotent stem cells were isolated from a skin biopsy taken from patients with either the qbt-AAT or MM-AAT phenotype. These cells were transformed into hepatocytes and treated with ataluren (0 -62.5\u03bcg/ml) or gentamicin (0.5\u03bcg/ml) for 48h. AAT gene expression was determined via qRT-PCR, the protein quantified using ELISA and protein size determined by western blot analysis. A significant increase in AAT gene expression in both MM-AAT and qbt-AAT cells was found following 62.5\u03bcg/ml treatment of ataluren (n=3, p<0.001) with a trend towards significance following gentamicin treatment. Ataluren (62.5\u03bcg/ml) also increased the concentration of secreted protein above the control levels for both MM-AAT and qbT-AAT cells (n=6, p<0.05). There was no shift in qbt-AAT protein size following either treatment (n=6).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 594, "end": 597, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 701, "end": 704, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "In conclusion, these results demonstrate that neither ataluren nor gentamicin cause read-through of the nonsense null bolton mutation to generate a full length AAT protein. However, there are increased levels of qbt-AAT on both the gene and protein level, indicating that these drugs may be stabilizing the mRNA preventing nonsense mediated decay. qbt-AAT can still function as both an anti-inflammatory and an anti-protease therefore these results indicate a potential use for ataluren in increasing qbt-AAT levels and thus increasing protection from unchecked pro-inflammatory meditators. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ATTD) is a genetic condition that predisposes to emphysema. Unpublished work from our laboratory has shown that AATD neutrophils have increased degranulation of primary granules. It has been demonstrated elsewhere that neutrophils of HVCN-1 (hydrogen voltage-gated channel-1) knockout mice have increased degranulation of primary granules (1). HVCN1 is a transmembrane proton channel found on the neutrophil membrane. We hypothesized that the abundance of HVCN1 is altered on neutrophils of AATD patients. Our aim was to demonstrate altered abundance of HVCN1 on neutrophil membranes of AATD individuals (ZZ) compared to healthy control cells (MM) and subsequently study the consequences of this. Western blot analysis of whole cell neutrophil lysates revealed a lower abundance of HVCN1 in ZZ-AATD neutrophils (p=0.0627). We demonstrated that the abundance of HVCN1 on the plasma membrane of ZZ neutrophils was decreased by flow cytometry analysis (p=0.0266). Two days after receiving AAT augmentation therapy patients with AATD showed increased HVCN-1 (p=0.0548). We hope to study the effects of this reduced abundance of HVCN-1 and ascertain whether it is related to the increased primary granule release seen in AATD. We also hope to understand the mechanism behind the reduced abundance of HVCN-1 in this patient group. Elevated circulating levels of IL-6 (p=0.04), sIL-6r (p=0.01), IL-6/ sIL-6r (p=0.03) and TNFR1 (p=0.008) were found in PWCF. Neutrophils isolated from patients receiving ivacaftor therapy had increased mIL-6r (p=0.03) as a result of reduced ADAM-17 activity (p=0.004). Ivacaftor therapy decreased plasma levels of IL-6 (p=0.02), sIL-6r (p=0.04) and TNFR1 (p=0.03). The mechanism resulting in increased ADAM-17 activity was shown to be related to reduced plasma membrane cholesterol content (p=0.007), which increased following ivacaftor therapy (p=0.02).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Our findings demonstrate that ivacaftor therapy indirectly corrected reduced plasma membrane cholesterol in CF neutrophils ultimately decreasing ADAM-17 activity and the cleavage of mIL-6r and TNF-\u03b1 to proinflammatory soluble forms. This study further identifies an auxiliary benefit of ivacaftor therapy resulting in reduced inflammation in CF. The major target in treating the proteolytic burden in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) is neutrophil elastase (NE) 1 . We evaluated the effect of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) on NE activity in CF and NCFB airway samples ex vivo, compared to those of two commercially-produced synthetic NE inhibitors and assessed the ability of each antiprotease to protect against cleavage of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) from neutrophils. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) samples from CF (n=15), NCFB (n=15) patients were evaluated. NE activity was measured using a NEspecific FRET assay and the ability of each compound to inhibit NE activity in CF and NCFB BAL was evaluated. IC 50 measurements were calculated subsequently. The capacity of each antiprotease to prevent proteolytic cleavage of CXCR1 from neutrophils in both CF and NCFB BAL was assessed by flow cytometry. The IC 50 of AAT against NE was significantly lower than both compounds in both CF and NCFB (5.4x10 -7 M and 1.2x10 -7 M, respectively; P<0.001), and AAT achieved greater protection against CXCR1 cleavage in both groups (P=0.003). Treatment with the concentration of AAT required for complete NE inhibition failed to achieve complete CXCR1 protection in CF. Treatment with higher concentrations of AAT, aimed at additionally inhibiting non-NE serine proteases, failed to achieve complete CXCR1 protection in each CF sample, in contrast to NCFB, where CXCR1 was fully protected. These data suggest that both non-NE serine proteases and non-serine proteases contribute to CXCR1 cleavage in CF such that anti-NE therapy may require combination with other protease inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the potential of Toll-like receptor 3 Leu412Phe (TLR3 L412F; rs3775291), as a candidate biomarker in IPF. We previously established that TLR3 L412F was associated with a significantly greater risk of mortality and an accelerated rate of decline in FVC in IPF patients (1) . Additionally, we demonstrated that 412F-heterozygous primary lung fibroblasts from IPF patients had reduced antiviral responses, following TLR3-activation, compared with wild-type patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 484, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2314, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "The primary aim of this study is to investigate the role of TLR3 L412F in disease progression in IPF in the context of antibacterial and additional antiviral responses. Specifically, we established the responses of primary lung fibroblasts from IPF patients to a panel of bacterial and viral TLR agonists. We demonstrated that 412F-heterozygous IPF fibroblasts have attenuated responses to the TLR agonists, Poly(I:C), LPS, Pam3CSK4, flagellin, FSL-1 and CpG. From an evolutionary perspective, we have also established that TLR3 L412F was prevalent within the Irish Neolithic period (3,343-3,020 cal BC) and are currently investigating the functional consequences of this in the context of bacterial and viral infection. These findings provide additional support for TLR3 L412F as a candidate prognostic marker in the treatment of IPF in the context of bacterial and viral infection. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown aetiology. Up to 90% of sarcoidosis patients have lung involvement including pulmonary fibrosis. This leads to impaired quality of life and sometimes mortality. To better understand the nature of the lung matrix we generated novel 3D multicellular foci from individual patient cells. Primary lung fibroblasts were isolated from explant tissue from patients with sarcoidosis or without lung disease. These were then grown in optimal conditions to promote 3D multicellular foci formation for a total of six weeks, treated +/-transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF\u03b21). Alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and collagen mRNA expression were assessed by RTqPCR and gross mechanical stiffness of the resulting multicellular foci was assessed by microsquishing. Treatment of sarcoidosis fibroblasts with 2.5ng/mL TGF\u03b21 caused a 6fold increase in collagen-1 (p<0.001) and a doubling of \u03b1SMA (p<0.05) mRNA and this was associated with a significant increase in gross mechanical stiffness (p<0.005), compared to untreated controls, indicating a successful switch to a pro-fibrotic myofibroblast phenotype. TGF\u03b21 increases fibrotic markers in sarcoidosis fibroblasts cultured in this long-term cell culture model. This 3D culture method provides a novel model to study the sarcoid matrix including the effects of targeted drugs ex vivo. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles measuring 30nm-100nm that are derived from endosomes in various cells and present in many and perhaps all biological fluids. They carry various molecular constituents including proteins, lipids, growth receptors, DNA, mRNA and miRNA. There is now increasing evidence that exosomes play a role in cell to cell signalling, due to the ability to transport proteins and RNA molecules between cells, and influence physiological and pathological processes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Age"}, {"text": "Using differential ultracentrifugation, we aimed to isolate and characterize exosomes from serum samples from patients with histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with known exosomal markers CD63 and HSP-70 using Western blotting and nano-particle tracking analysis (NTA). 85 serum samples were processed to isolate exosomes. Vesicles obtained from serum ultracentrifugation showed presence of CD63 and HSP-70 and the absence of Calnexin by Western blotting. We also confirmed exosome presence with the use of NTA (NanoSight NS 300), as the purified vesicles of our patients' samples had an average size in the range of exosomal diameter, between 40-100nm, which is in keeping with data from literature. These data confirm that the vesicles that were purified from our serum of our patients were indeed exosomes. Exosome isolation and characterization is feasible in serum of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer Heterogeneity at a morphological level in lung cancer has long been recognised, particularly in adenocarcinoma sub-type. As we move towards the genomic classification of this disease, tumour genomic heterogeneity has the potential to misclassify tumours due to the sampling bias of diagnostic biopsies. Lung cancer is one of the most highly mutated solid organ tumours, and it has been shown by multi-region sequencing that considerable genomic differences exist within the same tumour. We sought to determine if the cell free DNA contained in EBC could better represent this phenomenon than that of a diagnostic biopsy. Our preliminary results using UltraSEEK\u2122 in the Agena MassARRAY have shown that EBC-DNA is able to detect intratumour genomic heterogeneity in a patient with adenosquamous subtype with KRAS G12D and PIK3CA E542K mutations found in tissue, plasma and EBC and in synchronous primary adenocarcinoma & squamous cell carcinoma (KRAS G12D & PIK3CA E542K). We recruited 5 patients with early stage lung cancer and next generation, whole exome sequencing was applied to 4 different areas of each patient's resected tumour. Patient specific mutation panels were developed, and with this a priori information we will determine the proportion of these mutations in both the patients EBC, plasma and biopsy samples. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and severe of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs) characterised by varying patterns of inflammation and fibrosis 1 . As fibrocytes have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and exosomes have been identified in other organ/processes such as renal fibrosis 2 , to investigate the role of exosomes from fibrocytes in lung fibrosis, we first established if fibrocytes secrete exosomes and their modulation by TGF beta, a potent pro-fibrotic factor. We isolate human fibrocytes from blood samples containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's). We confirmed the presence of isolated fibrocytes by using Western Blot and immunofluorescence. We cultured the isolated fibrocytes for 72 hours with 10ng/ml of Transforming Growth Factor (TGF-\u03b21). We then extract and purify the fibrocyte derived exosomes using ultracentrifugation. We validated the presence of the exosome using Western Blot and Nanosight. Human fibrocytes were found to be spindle shaped cells and exhibit markers such as collagen, CXCR4 and alpha smooth muscle actin. They secrete exosome into their culture supernatant. The exosome were found to demonstrate features such as heat shock protein 70, CD 63 and absence of calnexin. The exosome were of the sizes between 30-120nm. TGF-\u03b21 increases the amount of exosomes secreted by fibrocytes but the appearance of the stimulated and unstimulated fibrocytes are similar.

Failure of the team providing normal medical care to document a patient's wishes or management plan regarding an acute deterioration, may subject patients to futile interventions, and expose staff to stressful situations. We introduced a pre-emptive 'ceiling of treatment' (CoT) form and measured staff reported anxiety regarding end-of-life care. Two online surveys were administered pre-and post-intervention, examining staff experience of caring for patients approaching end-of-life. Education was delivered to local units promoting the importance of early shared decision-making and prognostic conversations. Following CoT introduction, there were reductions in the proportion of doctors (91% vs. 14%) and nurses (73% vs. 40%) who witnessed patients undergoing treatments they considered futile. Medical staff reported a reduction in out-of-hours discussions regarding ceilings of treatment for patients already reviewed by their consultant (70% vs. 25%). There were reductions in the proportion of doctors (71% vs. 29%) and nurses (78% vs. 46%) reporting anxiety regarding appropriateness of interventions. All respondents felt CoT documentation improved patient care. Within our unit, the introduction of a CoT form led to marked improvements in communication and reduced staff anxiety regarding end-of-life care. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is widely accepted as the cornerstone of COPD management, and has been shown to improve exercise capacity, health-related quality of life and reduce breathlessness, fatigue and health-care utilization 1 . Despite this, dropout rates and non-completion remain an issue. We performed a retrospective analysis of completion rates in our PR programme. Only 49.5% of patients who were referred completed the programme (n = 47). 23.7% of patients started but did not complete the programme (n =23). Reasons for dropping out included: medical reasons (n=7); lack of interest (n=7); feeling physically unable (n=6); psychological issues (n=2) and time restraints (n=1). 26.8% of patients who were referred did not commence PR (n = 26). Reasons given for this included: lack of transport (n=7); distance to travel to the programme (n=2); feeling too well (n=4); psychological issues (n=1); feeling physically unable (n=3); lack of interest (n=4); no reason given (n=3); time restraints (n=1) and family commitments (n=1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "The results of this review show that while uptake and completion rates for our PR are in line with current international rates, it does highlight the reasons for non-completion and low uptake.

These patients were all referred to the clinic from the general respiratory outpatient clinic or were 6-8 weeks post discharge from hospital. Of 150 patients assessed, 70% suffered with COPD, 20% suffered with ILD and the remaining 10% had other conditions such as Heart Failure, Lung Cancer etc. 35% of patients assessed did not require supplemental oxygen, 17% were newly commenced on oxygen, 23% required a change in their original oxygen prescription, 9% required no change in prescription and 15% no longer required LTOT and had their oxygen removed. Assessment of patients who require LTOT is important to ensure patients receive appropriate oxygen supplementation and to reduce unnecessary costs. An\u00e1il and Irish Thoracic Society (2015) Irish Guidelines for Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) in Adults. Oxygen is probably the most common drug prescribed in the care of patients who present with medical emergencies. It has been identified that there is a lack of clear guidelines in Ireland and so a working group comprising of respiratory clinical nurse specialists and respiratory physiotherapists was developed to address this issue. Aspects of the guideline were divided and developed separately. Telephone conferencing, group email and face to face meetings were used to discuss issues as they arose. Feedback was sought from relevant stakeholders dealing with patients on oxygen in the acute setting to ensure robust representation. This comprehensive guideline covers all aspects of the use of oxygen in the acute hospital setting from the physiology of oxygenation to the health and safety issues that occur when using and providing oxygen. It also provides guidance to clinicians for the use of oxygen in the treatment of a large number of conditions. It provides concise information on assessment and follow-up of patients where oxygen is being used and also gives concise details on delivery methods available and when they should be used. It will enable practitioners administer oxygen in the acute setting in a safe and appropriate manner. The guideline will act as a template for auditing of current service provision. Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) refers to the provision of oxygen therapy for continuous use at home for patients with chronic hypoxemia. Patients with chronic lung disease such as COPD who necessitate LTOT therapy are often mobile outside their home and require access to portable oxygen therapy in order to maintain a normal lifestyle. The aim of this research was to examine the factors that affect patients' compliance with ambulatory oxygen therapy. A qualitative descriptive methodololgy was utilised for this research study. We recruited ten patients who used ambulatory oxygen across three hospital sites in the area where this study took place. All participants were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Data was analysed using the Braun and Clarke (2006) thematic analysis framework. Themes were selected by coding the data and the emerging themes were identified. One of the main concerns described by the participants in this study was the challenges they faced when presented with using oxygen cylinders. Participants stated they could not use the cylinders due to the size, weight, and volume of oxygen available in the cylinders whereas when another type of portable device was introduced compliance appeared to be less of an issue. The majority of participants, reported that they felt conscious about how they looked with their cylinders of oxygen when out socially.

In centers that specialize in weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation the regular use of polysomnography is costly and impractical. It is unknown whether actigraphy, which monitors gross motor activity, or behavioral assessment by a bedside nurse can be used as reliable surrogate measures of sleep for the reference-standard of polysomnography in such patients. We hypothesized that behavioral assessment (by bedside nurse) and actigraphy provide accurate estimates of sleep duration and disruption in this setting.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent for tuberculosis which remains a serious health concern globally. Autophagy has been identified as an important pathway process in both innate and adaptive immunity against tuberculosis through elimination of the pathogen. However Mtb employs an array of immune modulators to invade and thrive in macrophages by arresting autophagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes. Our aim is to identify novel host modulators of autophagy. We screened a number of FDA approved autophagy-enhancing drugs to overcome the Mtb-induced block of autophagic flux and boost host immune responses. EGFP-LC3 expressing BMDMs were infected with H37Ra and treated with autophagy-enhancing drugs. The number of GFP-LC3-positive puncta per cell was quantified by high content analysis to assess autophagy induction. Infected BMDMs treated with Sorafenib and Volproic Acid had reduced LC3-puncta levels per cell. We are currently establishing the effect of drug treatment on cytokine secretion and bacillary killing. We conclude that Mtb initiates autophagy in murine BMDMs however Mtb subsequently blocks autophagic flux. We have shown that existing FDA approved compounds which drive autophagy can be used to overcome this block in autophagy. Interest in the Aspergillus is significantly grown in recent days due to rising number of the immunocompromised population. Aspergilloma had not been a common referral to our respiratory services, but recently a rising number of referrals drew our attention towards its growing incidence. We are highlighting here three cases who were managed according to their presentation and background illness. Case 1: A 70 years old male, known case of COPD and alcohol dependence admitted for exacerbation of COPD. CXR showed LUL cavitatory lesion [ figure 1 ], which later confirmed as aspergilloma on CT scan [ figure 2 ]. Clinically asymptomatic and had normal bronchoscopy, initially given a short course of Variconazole, later decided to manage conservatively. Diseases of the pleura are common in respiratory practice. Pleural fluid analysis and accompanying imaging of the pleura are among the first steps in the work up of pleural effusions (1). However despite this initial assessment, up to 40% of exudative effusions will remain undiagnosed and further work up is mandatedin these cases medical thoracoscopy is a valuable tool. Overall the sensitivity and specificity of thoracoscopy is 92-97% and 99% respectively. This is better than that obtained by needle pleural biopsy and/or fluid cytology (2) . Patients who underwent medical thoracoscopy by the Interventional Respiratory Service from April 2013 -April 2017 were included. 45 patients underwent thoracoscopy for diagnostic purposes (table 1) . There was 1 false negative case which was confirmed malignant on repeat thoracoscopy. The procedure had a NPV of 95.6%, PPV of 100%, sensitivity of 96.3% and specificity of 95.6%. Thoracoscopy is a valuable tool in the work up and management of pleural effusions. It allows direct visualisation of the thoracic cavity along with biopsy of parietal pleura. As can be seen from this review the diagnostic yield is high with acceptable sensitivity and specificity rates. Complication rate was low with no procedure related mortality. (2).

Early mobilisation following thoracotomy and lung resection is frequently undertaken as growing evidence supports its use in optimising cardiopulmonary function, improving functional recovery; and therefore minimising the risk of developing post-operative pulmonary complications [1] . Despite well defined early mobilisation goals in Thoracic Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programmes [2] , the exact amount of physical activity undertaken, and any possible limiting factors, remain undefined. In 2017 the HSE carried out an evaluation of the Asthma Society's joint asthma and COPD Adviceline to determine its effectiveness in achieving the proposed service objectives and patient outcomes. A 2-stranded evaluation was undertaken. Service activity was examined through a document review and an interview with ASI staff. Service processes and service effectiveness were assessed through a survey of 442 service users. In total, 162 responses were gathered (37% response rate). All dimensions of the service were positively rated by users. As a result of using the service, the majority of users (79-88%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were confident in managing their condition, that they had an improved understanding regarding medications, an improved knowledge of what to do in the event of an exacerbation and an improved knowledge of the importance of engaging with a healthcare professional. The use of self-management plans increased as a result of service use, 56% of users had no prior plan but used one post call. The use of self management plans was found to maximise service effectiveness. Findings from this evaluation provide comprehensive and robust evidence that the service is effectively delivering the agreed objectives; in particular, a significant increase in the use of personalised self-management plans. This evaluation provides transferable learning with regards to self-management support which should be widely disseminated given its importance to emerging health needs and health service reform.

We fitted vector autoregressive models of current PEFR as a function of PEFR history and inhaler use, using data from the INCA -an electronic monitoring device attached to seretide dry powder inhalers -and twicedaily measures of PEFR. Three months of data were obtained from 174 patients with uncontrolled asthma, of whom 61 experienced exacerbations during the study period. Time series analysis showed statistically significant dependence of PEFR on recent PEFR values on a timescale of 1-3 days. PEFR was additionally shown to strongly depend on the history of inhaler use with a lag of 24 hours, and again at approximaely 72 hours after inhaler use. These peaks may correspond to the effects of reliever (LABA) and preventer (ICS) components of treatment. Intriguingly, the second, ICS related peak was not observed in patients who experienced exacerbations, suggesting that these patients may not be steroid responsive. The development of adjunct therapies with antibiotics has become increasingly urgent with the global increase in antibiotic resistance. Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection, is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients by utilizing biofilms to evade and resist antibiotic therapies.

We report for the first time, the use of small novel inhibitors of MIF, in an animal model of chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection, significantly attenuated weight loss (p<0.01), reduced infection and significantly decreased cellular infiltration (p<0.01) in affected murine lungs. This work has led us to the conclusion that MIF can enhance P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and that the use of small molecular weight inhibitors of MIF could provide an adjunctive therapy with antibiotics to treat P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients. Respiratory viruses are known cause of Cystic Fibrosis exacerbations. The prevalence of these pathogens has been studied previously identifying the most common pathogen as Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus. (1, 2) It has been suggested that sputum samples may have a higher yield if detecting these pathogens. However, difficulties can arise in processing mucoid samples. (1, 2) We aimed to study the prevalence of respiratory viruses using nasal swabs and sputum sampling and to compare the diagnostic yield of each modality using a wide panel of respiratory pathogens. Patients were recruited for this prospective observational cohort study when well (a minimum four weeks from last intravenous antibiotics) or at the onset of an exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics. Nasal Swabs (FLOQSwabs TM ) were stored in UTM TM Medium at -80\u00b0C. A 200\u03bcl aliquot of sputum was frozen at -80\u00b0C and subsequently thawed and homogenised using COPAN SL TM . Both nasal and sputum samples were processed using the FilmArray \u00ae Respiratory Panel in the National Virus Reference Laboratory. Sputum sampling is non-invasive and showed higher identification rates than nasal swabs in this cohort.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a glycoprotein possessing antiinflammatory properties with N-linked oligosaccharides, including sialic acid, which give rise to various glycoforms.

Primary hepatocytes were treated with interleukin-6, gene expression determined via qRT-PCR and protein expression via western blot analysis. AAT was purified from plasma of pneumonia patients during hospitalization. CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptor/chemokine engagement was assessed using flow cytometry and neutrophil chemotaxis was performed in response to CXCL7 or CXCL8.

Bordetella pertussis occurs as a primary infection in children younger than 10 years of age.Unvaccinated infants (0-8 weeks of age) are at highest risk of developing complications.These include respiratory distress, apnoea, seizures, pneumonia and death. The antenatal pertussis vaccine was introduced in Ireland in August 2012 after a pertussis outbreak in infants in the same year. A previous study has shown poor awareness and uptake of the Pertussis vaccine among Irish pregnant women.

Preschool BAL surveillance occurs in 3 Irish paediatric CF centres to assess lower airway infection. Here we update prevalence data of infection and inflammation over the last 7 years. BAL was collected via the SHIELD CF study from children with CF and disease controls (non-CF) undergoing clinically indicated bronchoscopy. BAL culture was performed at local microbiology laboratories. Presence/ absence of bronchiectasis was determined by radiology reports. IL-8 (ELISA) and Neutrophil Elastase [NE](activity assay) were measured at NCRC. 233 BAL specimens from 83 preschool children with CF and 29 controls collected over 7 years were included. Of 200 CF BALs 166 (83%), had organisms isolated from their lower airways. Of these organisms 36% were recognised CF pathogens. See figure 1 for comparison. Children with CF had higher levels of IL-8 (1384pg/ml vs 599pg/ml p=0.0028) and a greater proportion had free NE compared to controls (97/164 v. 12/ 31 p=0.03). 4 of 33 children with CF had bronchiectasis by 6 years of age (12%). Despite a reduced prevalence of infection over time in children with CF we are still seeing significantly greater inflammation than in controls, and a high incidence of bronchiectasis. Aerosol delivery rates in infants are generally low given the difficulty in interfacing an aerosol generator with the patient and poor compliance with therapy. Nebulisers are often used in combination with a facemask (FM) or are held close to the patients face in the hope that some aerosol is inhaled (blow-by) (BB). Given the rapid breathing rates in combination with the opportunity for substantial aerosol losses to the environment, inhaled dose is likely to be low. Here we compare the tracheal dose in an infant model across both interfaces. Aerosol was delivered to a simulated breathing infant. In line with standard of care, 4000mg of salbutamol was aerosolised using a jet nebuliser (Portaneb, Respironics, UK). Tracheal dose was measured after capturing inhaled aerosol on an absolute filter and quantification using UV-Spectrophotometry.

Orkambi (Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor) is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years or older who are homozygous for the F508def mutation in the CFTR gene. To date 14 adolescent patients have commenced on Orkambi in Cork University Hospital including 5 girls and 9 boys. The average profile of our patient cohort pre commencing Orkambi was 13.2 years, 46kg in weight, BMI 18.9, FEV1 91% and FVC 96%. Three of the patients were commenced on Orkambi in hospital; including 2 patients in a day unit setting due to a baseline bronchodilator response >12% and 1 patient who has severe CF respiratory disease (54% prior to commencing Orkambi). This patient subsequently experienced an adverse reaction in the form of chest tightness and tachypnoea requiring oxygen upon commencing Orkambi, which resolved on reduction of the dose to 200mg lumacaftor /125mg ivacaftor and commencing inhaled terbutaline 4 hours post Orkambi along with inhaled twice daily formoterol. She has since tolerated an increase in her dose to 400mg lumacaftor / 250mg ivacaftor. One other patient had significant drop in FEV 1 which was asymptomatic. Two further patients were commenced on Orkambi at a precautionary reduced starting dose of 400mg lumacaftor / 250mg ivacaftor per day due to CF liver disease though both children had a normal Child Pugh score.

There is very limited up to date literature describing the chest x-ray findings of aspiration in the paediatric setting. Our aim is to review chest x-rays of children with confirmed aspiration in a structured manner. This is a retrospective observational study of children who have undergone VFSS in OLCHC in the previous year. They are divided into two groups, patients with a definitely abnormal VFSS and patients with normal VFSS. Radiological findings compared between the two groups include right upper lobe changes, bilateral changes, peri-bronchial wall thickening, atelectasis, consolidation and clear lungs. Data collection is ongoing. To date data on 11 children with aspiration and 3 without have been collected. Among those with aspiration, X-ray abnormalities were seen in 8/11 children (7/11 orally feeding) with peribronchial thickening the most prevalent finding (73%), bilateral abnormalities in 45% and right upper lobe abnormalities in 55%.

A 15 year old male with advanced cystic fibrosis developed a small (one mm) linear tear in his PEG tube, approximately 40mm from the skin surface ( Figure 1 , left, arrow). His oral intake during the day was minimal so he was dependent on high calorie overnight feeds via the PEG tube. The patient's advanced condition precluded replacement of the PEG tube under general anaesthetic. Attempts to manage the tear with adhesive tapes yielded limited success. Overnight, a bespoke three piece sealing device was designed and fabricated using a multi-material 3D printer (Figure 1, right) . The device was precision made to fit tightly over the PEG tube and was positioned over the fractured section of the tube. On fitting the sealing device, the PEG tube was immediately ready for use and the patient was recommenced on his full supplement overnight feeding regime. In all, the completed device was fitted less than 24 hours after initial discussions between the clinical and design teams. The device is functioning well, two months post discharge of the patient. The diagnosis of Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) needs specialist diagnostic testing including electron microscopy. For this test a good quality ciliary brushing needs to be obtained. We aimed to appraise against a standard of the UK National PCD Specialist service that approximately 10% of nasal brushings will need repeating. This was a retrospective audit of all ciliary brushings performed in OLCHC from May 2015 to June 2016. Nasal and bronchial brushings were included. Patients case notes and lab electronic database has been used as sources for data collection. Data was collected using electronic data collection sheet. Post audit was carried out from July 2017-February 2017 after implementing remedial action plan. 45 samples were included. Overall failure rate was 38%. The main reason of high failure rate was poor quality of sample. 59 % of samples contained no ciliated cell and 29 % contained abundant bacteria. The highest failure rate was in nasal brushings (53%) and among the age group 6-10 years. The post audit results showed decline in the overall failure rate to 10% which is meeting the audit standards. Standard technique of ciliary brushings is essential and has to be implemented to ensure accurate and proper diagnosis making. Background: Omalizumab is an anti IgE approved therapy for sever resistance allergic asthma. There is specific indication to start asthmatic patient on omalizumab and all patient should have re-assessment after 16 week to decide whether to continue or stop the therapy according to the patient's response. The aim of this audit is to assist whether the service in UHL is implementing the NICE Guideline for Omalizumab in severe persistent allergic asthma. Methodology: All patients received omalizumab for 4 or more months during the Last 2 years were included in the Audit. The collected data were compared to the NICE guideline criteria to assess the compliance. Results: Eighty-six percent of adults in whom Omalizumab add-on therapy has been initiated met the criteria of starting Omalizumab. All patients whom received omalizumab have been re-evaluated after 16 week of therapy & all the patients whom had not shown an adequate response had discontinued the therapy after the re-evaluation. 78.5% of the patients are followed by a physician experienced respiratory medicine.

This association is already well known in asthma. Smoking is recognised as the main risk factor for the development of COPD. Secondhand smoke is also a factor in COPD particularly being linked to exacerbations in COPD patients and as factor in subsequent development of COPD in exposed children. There are established health benefits from smoking cessation in preventing progression of COPD and improvements in symptoms and in lung function. Despite the importance of smoking cessation in COPD many patients fail to quit. It is therefore important to examine the possible causes of this including the complexity of the disease, perception of aetiology, comorbidities such as poor mental health where depression and anxiety are very common and prevalence of severe dependence, combined smoking and abuse of alcohol. Literature reviews show clearly that COPD patients need specially structured smoking cessation programmes. The elements of these should include non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. One key element of treatment is the integration of smoking assessment and cessation into routine primary and secondary care. Assessment could include questionnaires, dependence tests, biochemical verification of selfreported smoking status. Respiratory physicians and all healthcare physicians should be trained in evidence based treatments and be prepared tom provide smoking cessation pharmacological and counselling to their COPD patients. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend a chest radiograph should be arranged after six weeks following community acquired pneumonia (1).

Demand for surgical lung biopsies when HRCT is not diagnostic of a type of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is increasing. This audit assessed the 90-day surgical mortality in patients having a surgical lung biopsy, and compared it to data from the literature reporting up to a 15% 90-day mortality in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) biopsied patients. Lung biopsies from 2013-2015 performed for the diagnosis of ILD were retrieved from the laboratory system and included only those with unclassified interstitial changes on pre-operative imaging reviewed at a multidisciplinary meeting. Data on morbidity/mortality at 30 and 90 days were recorded. Retrospectively, 38 patients were included from 2 centres with elective thorascopic biopsies were performed by two thoracic surgeons. The commonest histological pattern was hypersensitivity pneumonitis (n=14, 36%) followed by usual interstitial pneumonia (n=7) and smoking related interstitial lung diseases (n=6). In 11 cases 1 biopsy was taken, in 27 cases 2 or more biopsies were taken. There was no 90-day mortality. Four patients were listed for transplant, 2 with UIP were transplanted within 6 months. Outcomes (including diagnostic yield and 90-day survival) of thorascopic ILD biopsies in a thoracic surgery lung transplant tertiary unit is superior to published data.

Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody to CD20, is emerging as a useful therapeutic option in patients with IIM-related ILD. Method: All patients presenting to our institution with IIM-associated ILD between Jan 2014 and December 2016 were included.

Results: only 12 patients had regular bronchoscopy before EBUS, and only 5 had endobronchial biopsies done among these 5, 3 were diagnostic(60%). Single station FNA was performed in 80 patients with station 7 being the most frequent site for FNA. Mediastinal Adenopathy was the most common indication in 44% of patients followed by abnormal CXR in 25% of patients. EBUS yielded diagnosis in 90% of the patients. Conclusion: endobronchial biopsy remains a useful relatively safe test in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis particularly if access to endobronchial ultrasound is limited. However where readily available we would advocate EBUS as the initial and diagnostic modality of choice with a high diagnostic rate and low complication rate in appropriately selected cases. Further studies may allow accurate identification of patients where endobronchial biopsy alone may suffice. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fatal form of diffuse interstitial lung disease. Management of IPF requires an orderly approach, with regular evaluations and implementation of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The aim of this study was to review the tolerance, compliance, and efficacy of antifibrotic therapy in patients with IPF at our centre. Presently, there are two anti-fibrotic agents available for IPF patients, pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev). Since June 2017 nintedanib has only become available in Ireland to all IPF patients, having previously been available on a compassionate-use only basis. 75 patients were commenced on pirfenidone treatment during the study period. 54 (72%) were male. Most patients tolerated the maximum recommended dose of 2403mg daily. The commonest side effects of pirfenidone include digestive problems/weight loss, sensitivity to sunlight and deranged LFT's. In our population, 30% (n=23) reported significant nausea/weight loss which required dose titration or discontinuation. 11 (14%) patients had to stop therapy due to side effects but did tolerate recommencement once symptoms resolved. A further 12 (16%) also had to cease therapy due to side effects but could not tolerate recommencement and were subsequently initiated on nintedanib. 11 (92%) of these patients tolerated maximum recommended dose of 300mg daily with diarrhoea being the main reported side effect, with the other patient tolerating the recommended dose reduction of 200mg daily. Mortality rate and the pulmonary function results were also obtained. Lidocaine is the most commonly used drug for topical anaesthesia of the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree during bronchoscopy. It significantly reduces the incidence of cough and stridor, and the requirement for sedative drugs. It also has a low risk of cardiac side effect. It is available as 1-4% solution, 10% spray and 2% gel.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) as a result of lung disease and/or hypoxaemia is associated with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PH in patients undergoing lung transplantation (Group III PH) and to compare postoperative outcomes with those without PH. Retrospective review of transplant registry in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH) between the years 2014 to 2016. The overall prevalence of PH was calculated at 38%. This was highest in the alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) group at 60% and lowest in the pulmonary fibrosis group at 30%. Average length of hospital stay post-transplant for patients with PH was 34 days compared to 28 days in non-PH patients. The average age of the PH group was 50.7 compared to 50 years in the non-PH group. Arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and flutter were present in 28.2% of the PH group and 38% in the non-PH group. The majority were self-limiting. The overall prevalence of PH was 38% in our cohort of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Post-transplant outcomes for patients with PH were similar to those without PH. The Mater Hospital has employed a Thoracic Clinical Nurse Specialist to implement the first TERP in Ireland.

Implementation of TERP has reduced our post-operative stay by 50%. Physiotherapy and the promotion of active recovery are important in thoracic surgery to optimise pulmonary function, promote independence and maintain quality of life. Pre-surgery optimisation is an area in which further improvements can be made. We performed a retrospective data review of all patients admitted to the Mater Hospital, Belfast over a 12 month period who were coded on discharge with a Pneumothorax (PTX). Type of PTX, demographics, who inserted the initial Intercostal Chest Drains (ICD), size of ICD, need for a second ICD or discussion/ transfer to the tertiary thoracic surgical unit was recorded. Length of stay (LOS) was recorded. 30 patients were identified. 73% (22/30) needed an ICD inserted. 73% had initial chest drain inserted by A&E. Of which, 88% were 12French ICDs. The respiratory team inserted larger drains (18-32French). 41% of total patients needed multiple ICDs. There was no association between who inserted the drain and the need for multiple drains (p=0.65). However, the need for multiple ICDs were associated with a statistically significant longer LOS (6 days IQR 4-8.5 vs. 16 days IQR (8-29.5) (p=0.02) (Figure 1 ). Half the patients with a PTX were discussed with the tertiary thoracic surgical unit. 20% of these patients were transferred over to this unit. Despite national guidelines (1) , there is variation in practice as to size of drain inserted for PTXs. The need for multiple ICDs has a detrimental effect on LOS.

An on-line questionnaire-based study was conducted involving foundation and core trainees (n=20) assigned to a Belfast respiratory ward from August 2016 -February 2017. Information was sought regarding junior doctors confidence in chest drain management; specifically indications and contraindications to insertion, understanding of 'swinging' and 'bubbling' and knowledge regarding drain clamping and flushing. Post registration trainees (post FY1) accounted for 65% (13/20) of respondents. Average confidence level regarding chest drain management was 2/10. Doctors felt further education was required on indications and contraindications for drain insertion (55% and 70% respectively). Drain swinging/bubbling could not be assessed by 80% of respondents.

Endobronchial stenting is considered in patients with recurrent hospital admissions despite optimisation of medical co-morbidities. The use of the temporary carinal Aerstent (LeufenMedical) is reviewed. This was a retrospective review of a two specalist thoracic surgeons practise. TM was confirmed by history, PFTs noting large airway obstruction, expiration CT and assessment bronchoscopy with lavage. Five patients, 43-74 years, presented with dyspnea MRC grade III-IV (n=4) with 1 other patient failing extubation in ITU.

Nagle, C. O'Shea, A. Mulgrew Respiratory Department, Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee, Co KerryObstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) occurs in 4% of women and 9% of men. Continuous postive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most common treatment for OSA. Adequate compliance is crucial in prognosis. A retrospective study of 67 patients on CPAP attending the sleep clinic in Bon Secours Tralee was completed. This study aimed to evaluate CPAP compliance and the factors that affect it. AHI and ESS was measured at time of diagnosis, after auto titration, at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1year follow ups. Compliance was also measured at each follow up. Patients had excellent treatment outcomes with a mean improvement in AHI of 31.17 (34.74 initially, 3.57 at 1 year) and ESS of 8.94 (12.28 initially, 3.34 at 1 year). Compliance was excellent at one year (5.21 hours/night, range = 2.41 -10.3). Surpisingly, initial OSA severity, as estimated by AHI or ESS, did not influence CPAP compliance (r = -.271; -.256 respectively). This study demonstrates the value of follow up. Our study suggests that in a well treated group of patients, their initial parameters are not important in predicting CPAP compliance.4.6. Supine and Non Supine obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS): Comparison between gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), and OSAS severity M. Balicaco, C. Falcao, T. Nyaude, M. Purcell, J. Stephenson, B. Casserly, A. O Brien Respiratory Department, University Hospital Limerick Objective: To compare Supine and Non-Supine OSAS in relation to gender, BMI and Severity of OSA.Methods:The polysomnography studies (PSGs) of patients referred to our sleep centre, from 2016 up to the second quarter of 2017, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients with AHI >/= 5 per hour were included. All patients were investigated with full PSG. Respiratory events were defined as hypopnoea or apnoea. We classified OSAS between Supine and Non Supine, gathered and compared their gender, BMI and OSAS severity.Results: One hundred forty-eight patients had supine OSAS and 63 patients have Non Supine OSAS. Of the 148 supine OSAS patients, 90 were male. The average BMI of this group was 31.4, and 76% of these have a BMI between 25 to < 40. 46% of this group were classified as severe OSAS in both male and female population. There were 40 male and 23 female in non supine OSAS, with an average BMI of 33.6. 75% of this group have a BMI between 25 to <40. In this group of patients 53% were classified as mild OSAS in both male and female population. Conclusion: Presently, we found no difference between gender and BMI in both supine and non-supine OSAS; there were however, more severe cases of OSAS in the supine population than in non supine population.References: Joosten, SA, O'Driscoll, Berger, PJ, Hamilton, JS DM.

We developed an alternative pathway, with minimal consultant input, for OSA referrals, with the aim of reducing waiting time for investigation and management. Consultant triaged the referral letters and patients contacted with date for sleep investigations. Results were reviewed by consultant and onward referral as appropriate -Discharge, Advice, referred for CPAP or referred to Tertiary sleep centre. 252 patients were included in the study. 57 patients did not attend, cancelled or did not complete investigations. Of the 210 patients investigated, 126 patients were referred for CPAP, of which 122 have commenced. Following completion of their investigations, 71 patients were discharged. Waiting times were significantly reduced from up to 18 \u2192 3 months (referral to investigation) and from 8 \u2192 1 month (diagnosis to starting CPAP) with a significant reduction in non-attendance rates. This new pathway has demonstrated that it is possible to investigate patients for potential OSA with minimal consultant input, resulting in a significant reduction in time to diagnosis / management and consequently benefiting this group of patients.4.8. Metabolic requirements of human CD1c + myeloid dendritic cells in response to BCG infection D. Triglia, J. Keane, M. P. O'Sullivan Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, St. James Hospital, Dublin.Bacillus-Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is the only vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) and displays low efficacy in protecting adults against pulmonary TB. Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) are potent antigen presenting cells shown to be promising targets for vaccines and immunotherapies to fight infectious diseases. Metabolic reprogramming of host macrophages has been shown to be critical in the control of TB infection 1 . Here we investigate the metabolic requirements of mDCs following infection with BCG. CD1c + mDCs were isolated from human peripheral blood and infected with BCG. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates (OCR and ECAR) of infected cells were determined using an XFe24 Extracellular Flux analyser (Seahorse Biosciences). Statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric data) or the Paired Student t test (parametric data). Our findings show that maturation of mDCs in response to BCG induces changes in cell metabolism. Both ECAR and OCR basal levels were increased following infection, suggesting that BCG-infected mDCs rely not only on glycolysis but also on oxidative phosphorylation as energetic sources. Understanding the complex metabolic changes which human mDCs undergo following infection with BCG could uncover strategies to improve the ability of this vaccine to elicit protective immunity to TB.Gleeson LE, Sheedy FJ, Palsson-McDermott EM, Triglia D, O'Leary SM, O'Sullivan MP, et al.

O. MEARADepartment of Public Health HSE EastThe public health importance of animal TB was recognized by WHO in 1950 when the report of the Expert Committee on Tuberculosis The committee recognizes the seriousness of human infection with bovine tuberculosis in countries where the disease in cattle is prevalent. There is the danger of transmission of infection by direct contact between diseased cattle and farm workers and their families, as well as from infected food products.\" In 2015, there were an estimated 149 000 new human cases of zoonotic TB globally, and 13 400 deaths due to zoonotic TB. The African region carries the heaviest burden of disease and death due to zoonotic TB, The true burden of zoonotic TB is likely to be underestimated due to a lack of routine surveillance data from most countries. Incidences of TB in animals are described both nationally and internationally. Data on cases of Bovine TB in humans recoded in Ireland 1998-2016 are presented. The impact of the Bovine Eradication Programme in Ireland is examined in detail.4.11. Management of a complex TB outbreak in a third level institution M. O. Meara, A. Morgan, P. Lyng, E. O. DonohueDepartment of Public Health HSE EastContact tracing is one of the many components required in a TB Control programme. In January 2013 the Department of Public Health, HSE East was notified of 2 cases of TB amongst two students in a third level institution.TB contact tracing took place in accordance with the Guidelines for the Control and Prevention of TB in Ireland 2010. Following a site visit a number of additional contacts not initially identified by case 2 were found. One hundred and nine people were offered contact tracing. Of those that attended for initial contact tracing (88) there was a >50% positivity on Mantoux testing. Four further cases were identified over the following 10 months. Molecular typing identified linked cases and showed the value of linking clinical and laboratory data. This outbreak demonstrated some of the challenges in contact tracing in a third level institution where students and staff have competing priorities other than health. Compliance with public health follow-up and chemoprophylaxis amongst this age group is difficult. The value of an early site visit and the difficulties of engaging with appropriate senior management will be discussed.4.12. Pulmonary Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) PostLung Transplant-A case series from the National Lung Transplant Centre, Ireland. S. Winward, P. Ging, J. Kleinerova, J. J. Egan National Lung Transplant Centre, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin 7Despite robust prevention measures, TB can occur following transplant, we report the successful management of four patients who presented with pulmonary TB following lung transplant. All lung transplant recipients transplanted from May 2005 to July 2017 were included in this study. A retrospective, descriptive analysis was performed. All patients were QuantiFERON\u00ae negative prior to transplant. The diagnosis of active TB was delayed because of atypical presentation. Donor derived TB was confirmed in 2 patients who received a single lung from the same donor. The prevention of TB by careful screening and targeted treatment is essential. However, infection can develop after transplant either as 'de novo' or donor derived. Treatment of TB requires a multidrug regimen administration for the appropriate duration using nonstandard regimens with a high pill burden to avoid unmanageable interactions. The drug interaction between rifampicin and immunosuppressant medication is well known and can lead to loss of allograft. Careful monitoring of immunosuppression was required with titration of calcineurin inhibitor to achieve the target range. A successful response to treatment was achieved in this patient group with eradication of TB.4.13. Differential microRNA Expression in Human Macrophages in Response to M. tuberculosis Infection D.

O'Leary 1 * Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin; 2 St James's Hospital, Dublin 8 *joint senior authorsTuberculosis is the leading infectious disease killer worldwide with over one third of the world's population infected with M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Understanding the mechanisms of evasion of host immune responses by Mtb is crucial to develop improved drug treatments and vaccine candidates. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in gene expression and modulate cellular processes, such as innate immune responses. We sought to identify miRNA profiles in human alveolar macrophages (AMs) and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with Mtb. AMs were isolated from bronchial washings obtained from patients undergoing bronchoscopy under ethical approval, and MDMs were isolated from blood obtained. Macrophages were infected with Mtb and total RNA was isolated at 24-and 48hrs post-infection. RT-PCR was performed to analyse expression of miR-17, miR-21, miR-29a, miR-33, miR-125b, miR-146b, miR-155. We found differential expression of miR-21, miR-33, and miR-146b in macrophages in response to infection with Mtb at varying MOIs. Our results demonstrate modulation of miRNA expression in human macrophages by Mtb which may implicate several cellular pathways involved in host immunity, including autophagy. Our findings provide new insight into understanding Mtb-", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF19": {"text": "Case 2: A 65 years old male, known case of COPD, Ca throat s/p radio-chemotherapy, admitted with haemoptysis.

The aim of this audit was 1) to review molecular and histo-pathology reports from patients in 2016, 2) to compare histological with cytological material transitioning from Cobas to the molecular diagnostic test Oncomine Focus Next Generation Sequencing Assay. Results: Adenocarcinomas represented 85% of 131 patient cohort. 83% of testing was done on histological samples, and 62% on tissue biopsies. Out of cytological samples, 50% were done by EBUS. Total failure rate of molecular testing was 12.2%, 9% in histological and 27% in cytological samples. Mutations were detected in 44% patients with KRAS, EGFR and ALK rates of 25%, 12% and 3% respectively. Three BRAF and one RET mutation were also detected. Oncomine Focus Assay was done in 79% with a failure rate of 9.6%.Conclusion: This audit form an institution with a rapid access lung assessment clinic and MDT for all lung cancer patients, provides mutation rates similar to those published of non-Asian populations. 79% of these tests were done using Oncomine Focus Assay, making it a reliable molecular test.5.2.

Henry 1 Background: Standard dose computed tomography of the thorax (SDCT) is used to follow and exclude malignancy in pulmonary nodules. Ultra low dose CT with MBIR reconstruction (ULDCT-M) potentially can provide high quality images with a reduced radiation dose (1) . This study evaluated whether ULDCT-M allows dose reduction without affecting nodule detection or performance compared to SDCT. Methods: Prospectively 15 patients with pulmonary nodules on SDCT were included. At a defined interval, patients underwent two synchronous CT protocols (SDCT and ULDCT-M). Images were independently reviewed by two thoracic radiologists. Nodule characteristics, dose-length products (DLP) and effective doses (ED) were recorded. Results: Nine male and six females were included. Forty-nine nodules (mean size 4.7\u00b1 2.6 mm) were detected on follow up. ULDCT-M yielded a mean ED of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 mSv compared with 3.15 \u00b1 0.88 mSv for SDCT (P<0.0001). This resulted in a 97.4% effective dose reduction. Mean DLP was significantly less with ULDCT-M (5.6\u00b1 0.4 vs. 217.0\u00b1 60.4, P <0.0001). ULDCT-M detected 95.9% of nodules. No significant differences were observed between SDCT and ULDCT-M for nodule detection (P= 0.5), size (mm) (P = 0.5) or nodule characteristics (P=1). Conclusion ULDCT-M significantly reduces radiation exposure without affecting diagnostic performance, representing a prospective image technique for lung nodule follow up and lung cancer screening.

The most common deficient mutation is Z (Glu342Lys), but at least 100 other harmful mutations exist. AATD is under-diagnosed despite World Health Organisation (WHO) and American Thorasic Society(ATS)/ European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines advocating screening all COPD, poorly-controlled asthma, and cryptogenic liver disease patients, as well as first degree relatives of AATD individuals. 18,000 individuals have been screened following WHO and ATS/ERS guidelines in the National AATD Targeted Detection Programme. AAT phenotyping was by isoelectric focusing and AAT levels by immune turbidimetry. Sequencing of the SERPINA1 gene was used to identify rare and novel mutations. We have identified 305 ZZ, 280 SZ, 90 SS, 2670 MZ, 1776 MS, and over 100 individuals with rare deficient phenotypes (e.g. IZ, FZ, IS, Null, M malton ). A number of novel SERPINA1 mutations have been discovered. Our results illustrate the high prevalence of AATD in Ireland and the success of a targeted approach. We advocate that all COPD patients should be tested for AATD as per ATS/ERS and WHO guidelines. The advantages of a diagnosis of AATD include specific treatments such as augmentation therapy, family screening, smoking cessation, and the consideration of occupational and environmental exposures.10.10 Oesinophilia and COPD exacerbationDr. Jan Kara, Dr. Katherine FinanSligo University HospitalIntroduction: Respiratory disease kills one person in five in Ireland. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive.

Glanville, A. Sahadevan, M. Kooblall, R. Morgan Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin Elevated cardiac troponin T at presentation after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) has consistently been associated with adverse outcomes. Despite this it is not routinely considered essential in evaluating PE. We studied the utility of the biomarker troponin in evaluating and prognosticating after an acute PE. 85 consecutive admissions with pulmonary embolism were studied. Troponin-T on admission was compared to CT and echocardiographic criteria for right ventricular dysfunction. Mortality within 1 year from PE was recorded. Mean age of patients were 63.4 years \u00b1 15.9 (Range 24-91). 15/85 patients did not have a troponin level after admission. 22.9% of patients with an acute PE in this cohort had an elevated troponin. An association between an elevated troponin was associated with both CT evidence of RV dysfunction and echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction (\u03c72=20, p=0.001). Elevated troponin at diagnosis of PE was further associated with increased mortality within 1 year using Fisher's exact test(p=0.043). Commonly full echocardiographic studies after PE are unable to be performed emergently in overburdened hospitals hereby preventing timely identification of intermediate-risk patients for increased morbidity and mortality after PE. This study supports evidence for rapid stratification of PE's impact and prognosis using troponin. 11.2 A prompt for follow up-is it necessary? G. Loye, E.

Fitzpatrick 2 Sligo University Hospital 1 ,VTE is a common preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalised medical patients. These patients, often with one or more risk factors, have an overall increased risk of developing VTE during or post hospital admission. Timely and appropriate VTE thromboprophylaxis is an important quality indicator of Hospital performance. VTE prophylaxis audit was conducted to determine the practice in medically admitted patients in Sligo University Hospital and to determine compliance with local Guidelines. This retrospective audit was undertaken on 100 patients who presented to the Hospital between the 4th October and 4th November 2016 (100 cases). 85% of patients had a VTE risk assessment with the correct dose on their drug chart, 51% commenced on day of admission and 34% were already on NOAC. 85% adult patients receive a risk assessment for VTE on admission to hospital and prescription of prophylaxis as per Hospital guidelines.This audit shows that we are quite good at prescribing VTE prophylaxis on the medical wards in SUH but fall short of 100% standard and we need to reduce the delays in prescription and assessment. It is recommended that SUH VTE policy be fully implemented, educate staff on VTE prophylaxis section in drug kardex, Information leaflet to be given as 'Reducing the risk of getting a blood clot' to in-patients, encourage Ted Stockings where appropriate and present the findings of this audit to all medical staff.NICE guidelines on VTE, SUH GuidelinesAerogen, IDA Business Park, Dangan, Galway, IRELAND Tracheostomy is a common less invasive means of instrumenting the airways for the provision of ventilatory support. Similar to endotracheal tubes (ETT), tracheostomy tubes (TT) are used as a conduit for aerosol delivery to the lung, however, aerosol delivery via TT is not well described in the literature. Here, we compare aerosol delivery across these two interfaces in both adult and paediatric patient models. Aerosol was delivered during mechanical ventilation (Maquet, Servo-i). 4000\u03bcg of salbutamol was aerosolised using the Aerogen Solo nebuliser (Aerogen, Ireland). Adult and Paediatric ETT (ID 8.0mm and 5.0mm) (Teleflex, Ireland) and TTs (ID 6.4mm and 5.5mm) (Shiley, Covidien, Ireland) were used. Lung dose was measured after capturing inhaled aerosol on an absolute filter and quantification using UV-Spectrophotometry.The results are shown in the table below. Significance was considered at P <0.05.Aerosol delivery is seen to be significantly affected by the choice of patient interface, with TT facilitating delivery of more aerosol. This may be due to the shorter length and design of the TT.11.9 Aerosol delivery during passive humidification G. Bennett, M. Joyce, L. Sweeney, S. Ni Murchu, I. McDonnacha, R. MacLoughlin Aerogen, IDA Business Park, Dangan, Galway, IRELANDDuring mechanical ventilation passive humidification of the airways is achieved through the use of Heat Moisture Exchangers (HME). Unlike active humidification systems, no additional heat is applied beyond the patient's own exhaled breath. Heat and humidity are known to affect aerosol, however, delivery to the lung during concurrent HME use is not well described in the literature. Here we assess aerosol delivery rates during passive and active humidification of the artificial airway. Aerosol was delivered during simulated adult and paediatric mechanical ventilation (Servo-I, Maquet, Sweden). 4000\u03bcg of salbutamol was aerosolised using the Aerogen Solo nebuliser (Aerogen, Ireland). The nebuliser was placed between the wye and endotracheal tube. Active humidification was supplied by a hot pot humidifier (Fisher & Paykel, NZ). Passive humidification was supplied by a HME (Clear-Therm, Intersurgical, UK). Lung dose was measured after capturing inhaled aerosol on an absolute filter and quantification using UV-Spectrophotometry. The results are shown in the table below. Significance was considered at P <0.05.There was no significant difference in lung dose recorded between active and passive humidification.11.10 Safety and Feasibility of a CT guided lung biopsy service in a level3 S Sharif i , J Slattery ii , H Logan ii , S Glynn ii , A O'Brien iii , F O'Connell iv , MS Sheehy ii i Medical Student, University College Dublin, Dublin; ii Mullingar Regional Hospital, Mullingar, Westmeath; iii Limerick University Hospital, Limerick; iv St James Hospital, James Street, Dublin 8We wished to assess the safety of CT guided biopsy service in a level 3 regional hospital with Multi-Disciplinary Team link up to a larger level 4 hospital. We audited all lung biopsies for 9 years 6 months (114 months) (from 1st December 2007 to 31st May 2016). We looked at complications of the procedure including pneumothorax, pneumothorax requiring a chest drain, parenchymal bleeding and air embolus. There were 317 patients who had 368 lung biopsies performed over the 114 months. 172 (46.7%) biopsies were on lesions <20mm in size. There were 134 (36.4%) pneumothoraces of which 33 (8.9%) required a chest drain. There were 97 intra parenchymal bleeds visible on either post procedure CXR or the intra procedure CT. None of these bleeds required active intervention and none required admission. There was one presumed air embolus whose neurological symptoms resolved fully. 3 patients had repeat CT performed in SJH for technical / safety reasons.Our results support the current practice that CT guided lung biopsy is a service that can be provided locally in a level 3 hospital with level 4 hospital support.Irish Thoracic Society Poster Review and DiscussionSaturday 11 th November 2017 12.

Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with respiratory failure and death (1) . Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the standard of care for respiratory failure in MND (2) . The aim of this study was to determine NIV compliance rates and their relationship with patient outcome.This was a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to our MND clinic initiated on NIV between January 2015 and July 2017. Compliance was reported as percentage of days in a 3-month period NIV usage exceeded 4 hours and tracked over 9 months from initiation. 40 patients were trialled on NIV during the study period with compliance data available for 31. On initial presentation mean FVC was 90% and mean SNIP was 55cm H 2 O. Mean compliance at 3, 6 and 9 months was 40%, 46% and 47%. Median survival following successful initiation of NIV was 383 days. Patients commenced on NIV with initial compliance \u226550% survived longer (median 479 days p= 0.036). Non-invasive ventilation is effective at improving survival length in patients with motor neurone disease. Compliance with therapy was associated with longer survival. Our data is consistent with published research. Tobacco smoking remains a huge public health threat in Ireland, with a prevalence rate approximately 18.7% according to 2016 HSE estimates. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), which can increase smoking cessation success rates by 50-70% (0), is pivotal in tobacco dependence treatment. The HSE Tobacco Control Framework (2) recommendation is that an offer of smoking cessation intervention be made to all habitual cigarette smokers. During a two-week review of our Respiratory inpatients (n=91), a prescription for NRT was documented in only 15% (n=3) of active smokers (n=19). Lack of knowledge of NRT doses and time constraints were identified as key barriers to prescribing NRT. Education sessions regarding smoking cessation interventions were undertaken. Following this, a re-audit was undertaken by means of a questionnaire for each surveyed patient. 65 inpatients were included, of whom 20% were smokers (n=14). 72% of these were prescribed NRT. There was almost a 5-fold increase in NRT prescriptions after physician education. Doctors play a key role in smoking cessation encouragement for hospitalized patients. Regular education is key to ensuring high prescription rates of NRT in this population (1). References On admission for status asthmaticus, the patient may receive aerosolised beta-agonists as a first line therapy, often with concurrent supplemental oxygen. There are an increasing number of options available for codelivery of aerosol and oxygen. These include high flow therapy (HFNT) and use of a nebuliser with supplemental oxygen passing through the device. Here, the level of aerosol delivered beyond the trachea was investigated across both interventions. Aerosol was delivered to a simulated breathing adult. 4000\u03bcg of salbutamol was aerosolised using the Aerogen Solo nebuliser (Aerogen, Ireland). The nebuliser was used in combination with the high flow system (Teleflex RCI Neptune\u2122) (HFNT) and separately in combination with the Aerogen ULTRA aerosol chamber (Aerogen, Ireland) (NEB). HFNT delivery was assessed at 10 and 60LPM, whilst NEB was assessed with supplementary oxygen flows of 2 and 6LPM. Tracheal dose was measured after capturing inhaled aerosol on an absolute filter and quantification using UV-Spectrophotometry. Rationale: Histological evidence of well-formed non-caseating granulomas, or sarcoid reaction, has been noted in our centre either at the time of initial cancer diagnosis and staging, or at a time when recurrence is suspected.

Methods: We identified 289 patients diagnosed histologically with sarcoid over a 6-year period in one centre, from 2010 to 2016. 50 of these patients had a new or prior malignancy. Data was collected on these 50 patients including, age, sex, malignancy, interval from malignancy to sarcoid diagnosis, whether the malignancy was active or in remission, site of diagnostic biopsy, indication for biopsy, the cancer treatment involved and whether treatment was required for sarcoid. Results: The most common associated malignancies were Gastrointestinal (20%), Haematological (18%), Pulmonary (12%), Gynaecological (12%) and Head and Neck (12%). Biopsy sites included mediastinal nodes (74%), local nodes at the time of surgical resection (14%), bone marrow (4%), cervical lymph nodes (4%), inguinal lymph nodes (2%) and porta hepatis lymph nodes (2%). Tissue diagnostic of sarcoid was obtained most frequently via Endobronchial ultrasound fine needle aspiration (68%). 36% of the sarcoid cases were diagnosed at the same time as their initial histological malignancy diagnosis, 30% were diagnosed within one year, 28% of patients within 5 years and 6% were diagnosed beyond 5 years. 37 of the patients had pulmonary sarcoid. Of these, 34 patients had stage 1 disease, and 3 patients had stage 2 disease. Conclusions: 50 of 289 patients (17.3%) with a histological diagnosis of sarcoid had an associated malignancy that was either new or had been previously treated. The large majority (74%) had hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 36% of the sarcoid cases were diagnosed at the same time as their initial histological malignancy diagnosis. Typically, these patients had radiological lymphadenopathy, that was often FDG-avid, at initial cancer staging. Biopsy of these avid glands, proving sarcoid reaction, down-staged their malignancy allowing more aggressive cancer treatment with often curative intent. This report highlights the importance of sampling all pathologic lymph nodes that would potentially re-stage malignancy. Breathlessness, a common feature of interstitial lung disease (ILD), impacts on patients' physical and psychological wellbeing. Research suggests that a hand-held fan that generates airflow over the face can reduce the sensation of breathlessness. The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association provided a hand-held fan to patients and invited them to provide feedback via a 4-point Lickert-scale questionnaire to rate the frequency of their breathlessness with activities of daily living, and their experiences of using the fan. 27 patients responded (12M:15F); mean age 66 years and median time from diagnosis of 5 years. 24 respondents had Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and 3 had another ILD. 52% were prescribed anti-fibrotics and 52% were oxygen-dependent. Activities that caused dyspnoea often/ always included exercising (91.6%), climbing stairs (82.61%), and household chores (79.13%). 56.5% of patients used the fan often/every day. A majority of patients agreed/strongly agreed that the fan was effective (100%), easy-to-use (91.3%), helped improve breathlessness (90%) and relaxation (70%), and enabled them to concentrate more on their breathing (77%). 95% said they would continue to use the fan and 95% would recommend it to another patient. Healthcare professionals should consider hand-held fans as a practical non-pharmacological treatment option for dyspnoea in ILD patients. In practice, pleural fluid pH is essential for decision making in the management of pleural effusions. We aim to assess the impact of performing bed side pleural fluid pH as a part of a newly introduced respiratory ledpleural service on patient outcomes.
