If angiogenesis cannot catch up with the speed of hypoxia by long term bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), bladder ischemia may be induced. Progress in understanding the mechanisms regulating angiogenesis could off er novel therapeutic options in the treatment of bladder dysfunction. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major growth factor that directly participates in angiogenesis. Recently, enhanced angiogenesis of bladder as early response to BOO for the adaptation to the new metabolic status was demonstrated. Th erefore, we designed this study to investigate the change of angiogenesis growth factor receptors expression of the bladder in late BOO of rats.",

However, there is still an historic deep rooted fear of its use due to the existence of late genitourinary toxicities such as the radiation cystitis. Nowadays these toxicities may pose less of a threat due to the use of newer radiotherapy techniques and the reduction of radiation doses applied to the tissues adjacent to the tumor. Th e objective of our study is to fi nd predictive factors and determine the cumulative incidence of overall and severe radiation cystitis.

Th e current analysis compared the eff ect of LHRH agonists and the GnRH antagonist, degarelix, on serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), a marker of bone turnover, and the incidence of skeletal adverse events (AEs). Conclusions: Degarelix suppressed S-ALP more quickly and for longer than LHRH agonists. It also reduced bone pain and was associated with a lower incidence of fractures. Collectively, these data indicate that degarelix provides better control of skeletal disease in men with metastatic prostate cancer, an eff ect that may be mediated by its diff erential eff ect on FSH.",

Th ese plants contain aristolochic acid (AA), a powerful nephrotoxin and human carcinogen, which, in susceptible individuals, causes chronic kidney disease and/or upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Bioactivation of AA yields a reactive intermediate that binds covalently with DNA to form aristolactam (AL)-DNA adducts. In the urothelium, these adducts give rise to a unique mutational signature. As there are several reports of renal dysfunction in Japan associated with the use of AA-containing Chinese herbs, we hypothesize that a fraction of UTUC cases in this country may result from past use of Aristolochia herbs.",

Th e mean patient age was 57 yr (43-71 yr). Th e mean operative time was 241 min (180-300 min), and the mean estimated blood loss was 290 ml (50-1000ml). Th e mean length of tumor thrombus was 5.5 cm (4-10 cm). With a mean follow-up of 11.5 mo (5-30 mo), one patient was identifi ed lung metastasis four months postoperatively. Introduction and Objective: Partial nephrectomy provides equivalent oncologic and superior functional outcome compared with radical nephrectomy over the short-and long-term. With the development of laparoscopic techniques and increasing laparoscopic surgical experiences, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has become an acceptable alternative to radical nephrectomy for expert laparoscopic urologists to treat small renal mass. However, higher complexity tumors are associated with more resection of normal tissue, a longer warm ischemia time, and postoperative morbidity, especially entirely endophytic hilar tumor. In order to reduce normal tissue resected during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for entirely endophytic hilar tumor, we develop a novel technique to deal with the higher complexity tumors.",

UVENTA\u00ae stent placement could represent a new option of conservative treatment for ureteral fi stulas. Materials and Methods: UVENTA\u00ae self-expanding ureteral stent are able to restore urinary fl ow in ureteral stenosis and to facilitate the closure of ureteral fi stulas thanks to its triple layer structure made of two layers of metal mesh with interposed a PTFE membrane. UVENTA\u00ae stents are available in diff erent lengths and diameters, and allow the coaxial overlap of the ends of multiple stents, providing a lumen of large caliber able to ensure the proper urinary fl ow and the possibility of further endoscopic procedures. We show the case of 65-year-old man that in September 2014, undergone to pelvic surgery for an adenocarcinoma of the sigma in advanced stage. Th e postoperative period revealed a urinary leakage, dealt initially in conservative way by the general surgeon. Due to unsatisfactory results, the patient was then evaluated by the urologist and subjected to bilateral ascending pyelography highlighting the presence of a high fl ow left ureteral fi stula in pelvic tract; he case was managed immediately with Bilateral ureteral stenting prior to placement of a UVENTA\u00ae stent. Th e subsequent step was a retrograde pyelography through the left stent, used to identify the site of the ureteral fi stula. Aft er hydrophilic guidewire positioning and Mono-J stent removal, the delivery system of the UVENTA\u00ae stent is advanced coaxially to the guidewire under radiologia control. Once reached the desired position the stent is released from its delivery system whit pull-back technique playing a UVENTA\u00ae stent 9Fr x 20 cm allowing its simultaneous self-expansion. Th e next ureteroscopic control has shown the need to placement of an additional UVENTA\u00ae stent to complete fi stula's coverage. Following the insertion of a hydrophilic nitinol guidewire a new UVENTA\u00ae stent 9Fr x 12 cm has been positioned further in order that the ends of the two stent's overlap for a length of at least 3 cm.",

Recent data suggested that severity of LUTS was associated with that of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) in elderly men. However, information on the association in young adults is limited. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between LUTS and LOH symptoms in young and middle-aged adults. Results: Th e mean ages of the patient and control groups were 40.50\u00b15.12 years and 38.17\u00b12.12 years, respectively (p=0.09). Th e mean IFSF-total and all of the IFSF sub scales (except pain) in the patient group were signifi cantly lower than those of the control group.

Th e mean IIQ-7 scores of the patients was higher than controls, however this increase was not statistically signifi cant (p=0.11). Introduction and Objective: SAV1 is one of the core components of Hippo pathway, and this pathway plays a role for cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration through regulation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). YAP1 is known as an oncogenic protein in many human cancers, but only a few studies demonstrated that YAP1 acts as an oncogene in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In our previous study, we identifi ed SAV1 was downregulated in high grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cases compared with low grade ccRCC cases and re-expression of SAV1 inhibited RCC cell proliferation in vitro. To evaluate a role of SAV1 in vivo, we created a murine xenograft model of human RCC.",

Th e reasons for popularity in laser are ease of performance, lesser complications, and good results. It is the complications factor that makes it look attractive. Th e onus is therefore to make TURP safer. Th is is more applicable in India, where the cost of laser excludes 80-90% of patients. Numerous innovative procedures have been tried to make TURP safer. Continuous outfl ow has been described as innovation, the means to achieve it not described. Introduction and Objective: Prophylactic peri-vesical drain placement during suprapubic prostatectomy remains a widespread surgical practice. However the surgical technique of suprapubic prostatectomy has signifi cantly improved and as such the contemporary role of prophylactic surgical drains needs reevaluation. It has been traditionally assumed that prophylactic drains helps prevent fl uid collection (blood, serum, urine) which if not drained can lead to surgical wound complications. Th is paper investigates the incidence of surgical wound complications aft er a series of suprapubic prostatectomy done without placement of surgical drains but in the context of modifi cations to the surgical technique.",

Common investigations that respondents proposed included urofl owmetry \u00b1 post-void residual volume measurement (75%), PSA (63%), urinalysis (52%), voiding diary (45%), physical examination (38%) and TRUS-biopsy (33%). However, only urinalysis and symptom scores are essential investigations recommended consistently in major international guidelines. Whether urofl owmetry should become an essential investigation in SEA remains debatable. LUTS secondary to BPH/BPO (94%) and OAB (71%) were the two most common diagnoses for the case scenario, and correspondingly, alpha-blocker (97%) and antimuscarinics (55%) were the two predominant treatments suggested by respondents. Nocturnal polyuria is a common cause of nocturia especially amongst elderly, yet relatively few urologists (32%) considered this condition as a main diagnosis.

Female Urethral prolapse is a rare condition that has bimodal distribution aff ecting postmenopausal women and prepubertal girls. Female urethra has two layers of smooth muscles inner longitudinal layer and outer circular which remain adherent to each other by strong connective tissue. Separation of these two layers with episodic increase in intra-abdominal pressure leads to complete urethral prolapse. Birth trauma during prolonged vaginal delivery, perineal tears, debility, malnutrition and periurethral bulking agent injections have been implicated in postmenopausal group.",

Referring to famous researchers, Fran\u00e7ois Gigot de La Peyronie (1678-1747), founder of the Royal Academy of Surgery of France, described the homonymous disorder (1743), consisting of penile deformity due to induration of the corpora cavernosa of the penis.

In 1988, fi rmer silicone coated prosthesis became the \"gold\" standard.

Th e primary strategy has been to coat the surface of the catheter with repellant agents, such as silver alloy hydrogels or anti-biotics. Anti-bacterial peptides, such as human beta defensing 3 (HBD-3) or cathelicidine are naturally produced peptides from the urothelium, acting to inhibit bacterial attachment and infi ltration as part of the innate immunity of the host.

Introduction and Objective: Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae are an increasing concern in an era of antibiotic resistance as they cause infections ranging from community acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) to life threatening sepsis. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence and antibiotic susceptibility profi le of all ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae at a university hospital in the United Kingdom. Patient gender, age and catheter specimen were assessed as risk factors. Patient age, gender and specimen type were recorded in the database. Urine samples received from outside our institution (including community isolates) were excluded from the analysis. Urine was processed by calibrated loop sampling on to chromogenic clear media (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK). A positive culture was defi ned as \u2265 105 CFU/mL except for samples from children and pregnant women where a cut-off value of >103 CFU/mL was used. Susceptibility testing was performed by BSAC (British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy) disc diff usion testing and reported for ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem), nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam, trimethoprim, cephalexin, fosfomycin, third generation cephalosporins (ceft riaxone, ceft azidime) quinolones (norfl oxacin or ciprofl oxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin) and others.

However, laparoscopic surgery was done under CO2. Water fi lled condition has several merits. Water pressure is suppressing venous bleeding and prevent from CO2 embolism in venous injury condition. To keep water temperature as same as body temperature was useful to avoid low body temperature. Simultaneous observation of ultrasound image from the surface of the body and laparoscopic view is possible during surgery. Th us we conduct to develop the water fi lled laparo-endoscopic surgery systems (WAFLES).",

Most urinary diversions are performed extracorporeally because of complex procedure time consuming. However, with the development of minimally invasive radical cystectomy techniques, increasing attention has been focused on intracorporeal urinary diversions, including both ileal conduit and orthotopic neobladder. We reviewed cases of laparoscopic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal ileal conduit in our medical center.",

Patterns of care, length of hospital stay (LOS) and blood transfusion rates (BTR) were compared by surgical approach. We then created an economic model to evaluate the incremental cost of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) over open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) incorporating the cost off set from diff erences in length of hospital stay and blood transfusion rates. Th e economic model constructs estimates of the diagnosis related group (DRG) costs of ORP and LRP, adds the gross cost of the surgical robot (capital, consumables, maintenance and repairs), and manipulates these DRG costs to obtain a DRG cost per day which can be used to estimate the cost off set associated with RARP in comparison with ORP and LRP. Economic modelling was performed around a base-case scenario, assuming a 7-year robot lifespan and 124 robotic cases performed per fi nancial year, and one and twoway sensitivity analyses performed for the 4-arm da Vinci SHD, Si and Si dual surgical systems (Intuitive Surgical Ltd, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is also known as a growth factor which activates not only macrophages but also cancer cells and osteoclasts through the activation of the specifi c Receptor d' origine nantais (RON). HGF and MSP are secreted as an inactive single-chain precursor (pro-HGF, pro-MSP), which lacks biological activity and, therefore, requires proteolytic activation for conversion to an active two-chain form by HGF activator (HGFA). Although, there have been reported a lot of study for HGF/MET signaling with castration-resistant (CR) PC and bone metastasis, the report for examination of plasma protein is rare. In addition, MSP/RON signaling axis is not well evaluated in PC. Here, we analyzed the associations between PC progression and plasma levels of HGF and a closely related molecule, MSP. Conclusion: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations in blood were examined by newly developed ultra-sensitive quantifying method, LC-MS/MS.

Complete stone removal assures resolution of the immediate adverse outcomes of the stone disease, and prevents possible long-term complications such as pain, obstruction and stone growth. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is an eff ective procedure which is being considered as the gold standard in the treatment of large/complex renal calculi. Reported stone free rates are up to 90%, probably refl ecting the level of experience, stone properties and equipment employed in the procedure. It is well established that higher incidence of residual fragments increases the complication rates and needs further interventions. Th e main reason for failure of complete radiolucent stone clearance is inability to visualize the residual stones either by nephroscope or by fl uoroscopy.

Th e management of T1a SRMs (\u22644cm on imaging) was accessed. Low malignant potential lesions were defi ned as cystic RCC, chromophobe and type 1 papillary RCC.Conclusions: A total of 31 benign and 36 low malignant potential SRMs were identifi ed, accounting for 31% of all SRMs identifi ed in our study. Th is group of patients could benefi t from active surveillance and non-operative management. Our data has identifi ed a signifi cant number of cases where options other than surgical resection could be considered and urologist's attitudes to management of benign and low malignant potential lesions remain an important factor in preventing unnecessary surgery.Introduction and Objective: Small renal masses (SRM \u22644cm) are a common clinical entity for the practicing urologist. With increased use of modern cross-sectional imaging, they now account for over 50% of all renal masses. Th e pathological characteristics of small renal masses in young adults however remain poorly defi ned. We aimed to review the tumour characteristics of small renal masses in young adults (defi ned as \u226445 years old) and compare them to older adults (>45 years). and Methods: We identifi ed all surgical resected small renal masses at a large tertiary centre over an 11-year period between 2004 and 2014. Data was collated on various pathological characteristics and the two age groups were compared. A total of 219 patients underwent surgical resection for small renal masses \u2264 4cm on diagnostic imaging. Forty-three patients (20%) were aged 45 years or younger. : Th e median age was 39 (range 20-45). Forty-seven percent of the masses were in females, 60% were left sided. Twenty-nine patients (67%) underwent nephron-sparing surgery. Median tumour size was 25mms. Th ree masses (7%) were associated with von Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome, while 40 masses (93%) were sporadic. Six masses (14%) were benign. Oncocytoma was the most common benign tumour. Th irty-seven masses (86%) were malignant. Of the malignant masses, clear cell RCC was the most common followed by papillary, cystic and chromophobe RCC. Where cancers were graded, 81% were low grade and 19% were high grade. Ninety-two percent were pathological stage T1a, while 8% were pT3a. Seventy-three percent were considered indolent cancers while 27% were considered potentially aggressive cancers. When comparing younger patients to older patients with SRMs, younger patients had similar rates of malignancy but were more likely to be female, have associated VHL syndrome and undergo nephron-sparing surgery. Younger patients with RCC had similar tumour subtypes, grade and stage compared to older patients. : Small renal masses in young adults are biologically hetereogenous and have similar pathological characteristics to SRMs in older adults. Younger patients have similar rates of malignancy, tumour subtypes, grade and stage compared to older patients. Our data suggests that age in itself is not an adverse prognostic factor for tumour pathology in patients presenting with SRMs.Introduction and Objective: Robotic multiplex partial nephrectomy (RMxPNx) is robot-assisted partial nephrectomy for 3 or more tumors from a single kidney. RMxPNx has been previously shown feasible with excellent preservation of renal function. Herein we compare renal function outcomes of patients undergoing RMxPNx stratifi ed by Body Mass Index (BMI). and Methods: A prospectively maintained database was searched for all patients who underwent RMxPNx. Multiplex partial nephrectomy is defi ned a resection of 3 or more masses in a single kidney. Patients underwent RMxPNx when the largest tumor measured 3 cm in size. Enucleation resection techniques of tumor excision was utilized in all patients. Th e patient cohort was stratifi ed into BMI<30 or \u226530. Statistical analysis was performed using a T-Test.Results: Fift y-four patients were identifi ed between 2007 and 2013 with 26 having BMI<30 (Group 1) and 28 with a BMI\u226530 (Group 2). Th e mean BMI for Group 1 was 25.8 compared to 35 for Group 2 (p<0.0001). Mean age for Group 1 is 45 and 47 for Group 2. However, no statistical diff erence was noted in number of previous ipsilateral surgeries[1.81 vs.  Conclusion: In experienced hands, robotic multiplex partial nephrectomy is safe and results in excellent renal function outcomes. Body mass index did not have a signifi cant impact on renal function or other perioperative outcomes. Larger studies are needed to confi rm these fi ndings.Ye J, Ma L, Wang G, Tian XPeking University Th ird Hospital, Beijing, ChinaIntroduction and Objective: Warm ischemia time (WIT) and hemostatic control remain the main concerns during retroperitoneoscopic nephron sparing surgery (RNSS). Th is study is to evaluate perioperative outcomes of sutureless RNSS with a bipolar coagulation (BC) by comparing with the barbed self-retaining suture (RRS) technique. and Methods: A total of 147 consecutive RNSS were carried out at our institution from December 2012 to December 2014. Fift een sutureless RNSS (BC Group) and 55 RNSS with barbed self-retaining suture (SRS Group) were observed retrospectively in consecutive sequence. Hemostasis is controlled either by a sutureless technique with a bipolar coagulation or by a barbed self-retaining suture repair. and Objective: Th e CyberKnife radiosurgery system is a new impressive device for the treatment of diff erent tumors. Th e purpose of this study to assess the effi cacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of clinically localized RCC. and Methods: Between January 2010 and February 2014 we studied 42 patients had histological or radiological evidence of Stage I (T1N0M0) renal cell carcinoma with a size no larger than 8 cm in greatest dimension measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 2 were with bilateral location (T1aNxMx) and 4 with metastasis into the brain, lungs, liver, bones and mediastinal lymphatic nodes of the neck (T1bNxM1, T3NxM1, T2NxM1, T1N-0M1correspondingly). Th e mean age was 58 years. : Th e median follow-up was 36 months. Forty-two of the 42 individuals were alive and had a minimum follow-up of 48 months. We concluded that high-dose-per-fraction, conformal external radiation may have a curative role for small, node-negative, organ-confi ned RCC. Th ere was a measurable size reduction in 42 lesions, including complete remission in 42. Renal function remained stable. Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation median creatinine clearance was 72.7 and 70.8 ml/minute/1.74 at baseline and follow-up, respectively (p <0.05). Grade I erythrodermia developed in 1 patient, 2 reported grade I fatigue and 4 reported grade I nausea. Nephrectomy was avoided in all cases. Kidney functions remained unaff ected after treatment.",

Initially we performed vaporization and vaporesection as surgical treatments for prostatic hyperplasia. From November 2007 diode laser enucleation of the prostate (DiLEP) has become a routine method for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To the end of 2013 we have performed a three-lobe technique in 192 consecutive patients. One hundred and six of them completed a 5-year follow-up. Because this is a new device, clinical results are limited and poorly described, we have created a video to demonstrate an advantage of this technique to another enucleations. and Methods: From November 2007 to December 2013, 192 patients underwent DiLEP for symptomatic BPH by single surgeon. All patients were assessed with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), serum prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA), urofl owmetry and residual urine volume (PVR) before surgery. Th e mean operative time was 62.5 minutes. No signifi cant intraoperative and early postoperative bleeding was observed. None of the patients required blood transfusion. Hospital stay aft er surgical intervention covered 1 day that was equal to average time of urethral catheter indwelling. We present a video demonstration of diode laser enucleation of the prostate in a 68-year-old male with BPH, prostate volume 100 cc. Th e patient presented with urinary retention managed by an indwelling catheter, following failed alpha-blocker treatment. : Th e improvement rates, calculated based on the IPSS scores at 4 years aft er surgery, were 78.9%. Th e results indicate signifi cant decrease in severity of LUTS. Th e treatment eff ect was sustained. Also treatment effi cacy as regards the maximum urinary fl ow rate (Qmax) was calculated.Conclusions: Diode laser enucleation of the prostate is low-risk minimally-invasive treatment option of treatment of patients with BPH. Th e method may be safely performed even in high risk patients on ongoing oral anticoagulation. Treatment eff ects is sustained. DiLEP is a true endourological alternative to TURP.

Buccal Mucosa Graft (BMG) has become the graft of choice in many centers, but sublingual and retroauricular graft must be considered in cases of insuffi cient oral BMG. Retroauricular (Wolfe) graft , a full-thickness skin graft with dense subdermal plexus, could be considered in patients with lack of oral graft s. It has proven to have good results and low donor site morbidity. We aim to present our technique for retroauricular graft harvesting. and Methods: We present a patient with recurrent distal anterior urethral stricture secondary to previous urethral reconstruction for hypospadias. Staged approach was opted. At fi rst stage patient had BMG harvested bilaterally and more graft was required.

Various methods of intraoperative double J (DJ) stent insertion during laparoscopic ureterolithotomy have been described previously. Key to the operation is the placement of DJ stent into a small ureteric opening laparoscopically which may be technically challenging. We present a video presentation on a novel method for retrograde placement of DJ stent in patients undergoing laparoscopic ureterolithotomy without the need for intraoperative radiological guidance. and Methods: Prior to laparoscopy, rigid cystoscopy is performed and the ureteral length from the bladder neck to the glans penis is measured using the cytoscopy shealth. Ureteric catheterisation is performed and advanced to the level of obstruction using rigid cystoscopy under sterile conditions. Th e ureteral length is marked on the DJ stent pusher and the patient is positioned and lateralised. Transperitoneal laparoscopic ureterolithotomy is performed in lateral decubitus position depending on site. Aft er stone removal, the ureteric catheter is exchanged for guide wire and the DJ stent is advanced across the ureteric defect under direct vision to the appropriate stent pusher marking and ureteral closure is performed. A retrospective review was performed for patients who underwent retrograde stent insertion and its viability assessed. : A review of 4 patients who underwent laparoscopic ureterolithotomy and retrograde DJ stenting in 2014 was performed. Stent placement was performed with minimal transperitoneal manipulation. No additional procedure was required for stent adjustments. Th ere were no signifi cant Clavien-Dindo complications (>grade 3) using this method.

We have reported our experience with indocyanine green (ICG) using near-infrared imaging (NIRI) to facilitate robot-assisted ureteral reconstruction, but this series is the fi rst to use this technology for complications of bowel-based urinary diversions. We present our method for localization of uretero-bowel diversion anastomotic strictures and reconstruction with the assistance of ICG fl uorescence using NIRI. PCN) reliant. Intra-operative localization of uretero-ileal anastomotic strictures was facilitated by NIRI and retrograde instillation of ICG into the bowel segment as well as antegrade instillation of ICG via percutaneous nephrostomy into the ureter(s). : All procedures were completed robotically. In all cases, retrograde instillation of ICG caused the bowel urinary diversion to appear fl uorescent with NIRI as opposed to non-urinary bowel. Th e ureter(s) was identifi ed using antegrade ICG and NIRI in all cases. Th is facilitated delineation of the stricture(s) under NIRI. Th ere were no intraoperative complications, blood transfusions, conversions to open, or aborted procedures. : NIRI and ICG appear to be safe when used to revise uretero-bowel diversion anastomotic strictures. Th is technology may provide an advantage that is specifi c to the minimally invasive robot-assisted approach. Also retrograde bowel urinary diversion ICG instillation and antegrade ureteral instillation of ICG via PCN(s).",

We had previously reported that chronic hypoxia accelerated cell migration and invasion. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the mechanisms by which cancer cells migrate and invade. We investigated whether the environment of chronic hypoxia induced EMT in prostate cancer cells. and Methods: Th e human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was cultured under normoxia (21% O2), acute hypoxia (1% O2 for 48 hours), or chronic hypoxia (1% O2 for 6months). We investigated expressions of key EMT molecules at the level of mRNA and protein in the each LNCaP. : Th e expression of Slug (SNAI2) which is known as a transcriptional factor and a key molecule of EMT was specifi cally increased and Zonula Occuludens (ZO)-1 which is known as a tight junction protein, was decreased. But other EMT markers including E-cadherin as an epithelial marker, and Vimentin and N-cadherin as mesenchymal markers, were not signifi cantly changed. Knockdown of Slug inhibited cell migration and invasion in chronic hypoxia LN-CaP cells. But expression of ZO-1is not signifi cantly changed by knockdown of Slug. Th en we investigated what is the target for Slug and induces migratory and invasive behavior in prostate cancer cells. : Th ese results suggested that chronic hypoxia is not associated with EMT in prostate cancer cells. But Slug might be associated with prostate cancer progression. Another mechanism which induces cell migration and invasion via Slug is thought to exist. Now we investigate which gene is the target for Slug and induces migratory and invasive behavior in prostate cancer cells.Assessment of PCA3 and Multiparametric MRI's Collective Benefi ts when Deciding Initial Prostate Biopsy in Patients Whose PSA Level Is between 3-10 Ng/Ml Okcelik S 1 , Soydan H 2 , Ates F 2 , Berber U 3 , Saygin H 4 , Sonmez G 4 , Karademir K 2 Dept. of Urology, Beytepe Military Hospital, Ankara, Turkey; 2 Dept. of Urology, GATA Haydarpasa Teaching Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey; 3 Dept. of Pathology, Corlu Military Hospital, Tekirdag, Turkey;",

Two patient's urine samples weren't examined for PCA3, because the urines were unable to be conveyed to the laboratory within 15 minutes so urine PCA3 RNA preservative could not be added. As one patient's urine sample didn't work in PCR it was excluded for PCA3 study. Th e mean age of patients were 61.22 \u00b1 1.06. Mean PSA values were 5.13 \u00b1 0.19 ng/ ml, respectively.

However, PSA is tissue specifi c and not cancer specifi c. Recently, EPCA-2, a prostate matrix nuclear protein, has been proposed as a prostate specifi c cancer marker. Th is study was conducted to investigate whether EPCA-2 can be a more helpful marker in prostate cancer diagnosis. and Methods: One hundred seventy-six patients enrolled in this study had abnormal PSA or DRE and were candidated for a prostate needle biopsy. Th e consent form was completed. Five cc blood samples were obtained from each patient prior to biopsy and samples were frozen for EPCA-2 measurement. Cases were the cancer-diagnosed and others with BPH diagnosis were considered as controls. Univariate and multivariable analyses were done to assess the relationship between diff erent independent variables with cancer diagnosis. Th e diagnostic power of EPCA-2 for cancer was estimated at diff erent levels of PSA, according to the ROC curve. : One hundred seven patients were diagnosed with BPH (controls) and 69 with cancer (cases). Th e mean age of cancer cases was 70.33 (\u00b19.02) while it was 63.34 (\u00b19.47) for BPH cases (p<0.01). EPCA-2 and PSA were also signifi cantly diff erent (p<0.1). Th e multivariable logistic regression has shown that EPCA-2 has a signifi cant relationship with cancer diagnosis (OR=1.009, P=0.021). Aft er controlling other variables following stratifi cation for PSA, it was shown that EPCA-2 and cancer were correlated just when PSA was >10 (P<0.000). AUC was 0.694, for cancer prediction by EPCA-2 when PSA >10. : EPCA-2 has the power of diff erentiating BPH from cancer in prostate cancer suspects. Th is suggests that EPCA-2 can be helpful in diagnosing PCa and can be a preventive test to avoid unnecessary biopsies considering PSA and age of the patient.Comparison between Transperineal MRI-TRUS Fusion Target Prostate Biopsy versus Conventional Transrectal Systematic Prostate BiopsyKimura M 1 , Muto S 1 , Saito K 1 , Isotani S 1 , Ide H 1 , Yamaguchi R 1 , Horie S 2 Introduction and Objective: Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy has been used for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but the technic is usually blind to cancer location. It has been criticized for both overdiagnosis of low grade tumors and underdiagnosis of clinically signifi cant prostate cancer. Multiparametric magnetic resonance (mMR) is enabling targeted biopsy of suspicious lesion. Th e detection of clinically signifi cant cancers has been facilitated by targeting according to PIRADS (Prostate imaging Reporting and Data System). In this study we compare in 55 patients, diagnostic accuracy of combination mMR cognitive targeted biopsy (MR-CB) using PIRADS and extended systematic template biopsy (TRUS-TB) versus extended systematic biopsy alone. and Methods: Included in this prospective study were 55 consecutive men with suspicious for prostate cancer. Median age was 66 years (range 49-84) and mean prostate specifi c antigen was 8.9 ng/ ml (range 1.81-44). Prebiopsy, all patients received 1.5 Tesla mMR of the prostate, consisting of T2-weighted, diff usion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR. Th e degree of suspicion from mMR fi ndings was classifi ed according to the PIRADS scoring system. A median of four targeted biopsies per lesion were obtained and 17-core extended systematic TRUS-TB was performed in every patients. Imaging data and biopsy results were analyzed. : Th e tumor detection rate was signifi cantly higher with MR-CB compared with TRUS-TB (27/55, 35th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2015 ABSTRACT BOOK 49%; 12/55, 21%, respectively, p<0.005). MR-CB detected prostate cancer in all signifi cant patients with positive TRUS-TB. Th e mean PIRADS score of all lesions was 2.6\u00b10.52. Tumor lesions show a signifi cantly higher sum score compared with benign lesions (p<0.005). Regarding tumor malignancy, no high grade prostate cancer (Gleason score>7) was present at PIRADS score <3. : Combined MR-CB and TRUS-TB technic is more eff ective compared with TRUS-TB in detecting clinically signifi cant prostate cancer. PIRADS score give additional information and could be part of the decision-making process when considering biopsy. Th is method of prostate cancer detection may help to reduce the overdiagnosis and associated overtreatment of clinically insignifi cant prostate cancer by reducing unnecessary biopsy. Ekwueme K, Ismail N, Horsu S, Rashid A, Nwafor N, Bourns S, Venturi C, Das S, Awsare N, Pettersson BCountess of Chester Hospital, Chester, UKIntroduction and Objective: High false negative rates with TRUSB result in many patients requiring repeat biopsy for persistent suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). We adopted a policy to off er MRI scan prior to TRUSB and subsequent biopsy to include targeted sampling of any abnormal area on the MRI. Herein, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this strategy controlled with matched cohort who underwent conventional systematic TRUSB without MRI. and Methods: Between June 2012 and October 2013, 411 patients with raised PSA referred for TRUSB were retrospectively studied. Of these, 132 underwent pre-biopsy MRI (Group 1) and 279 underwent systematic TRUSB without MRI (Group 2). A hundred and ninety two cases were repeat TRUSB aft er a median of 1 (range 1-4) negative biopsies. Prior to TRUSB, Group 1 underwent 1.5 Tesla T2 and diff usion weighted imaging (dwi) MRI with Synergy body coil covering prostate and seminal vesicles. Areas suspicious of tumour were localised to one or more zones which were targeted at time of TRUSB. Statistical analysis was by Chi-square using IBM SPSS\u00ae version 20.Conclusions: MRI prior to conventional TRUSB does not improve cancer detection rate. As a negative MRI does not preclude PCa, we recommend that these patients should undergo MR targeted biopsy or transperineal saturation biopsy instead.Linares QuevedoA, Castellucci R, S\u00e1nchez G\u00f3mez, F, Cogollos Acu\u00f1a I, Salinas Moreno S, D\u00edez J, Salmer\u00f3n Beliz I, Mu\u00f1oz Fern\u00e1ndez de Legaria M, Santonja C, Mart\u00ednez-Pi\u00f1eiro LInfanta Sof\u00eda Hospital, Madrid, SpainIntroduction and Objective: Th e ideal biopsy strategy to identify men with prostate cancer would be detection of only signifi cant prostate cancer and minimization of insignifi cant prostate cancer detection and consequent overtreatment. MRI targeted biopsy is a promising strategy that may off er these advantages compared to standard systematic TRUSGB. Th e aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic effi cacy of MRGB with TRUSGB. and Methods: A total of 168 biopsy-naive subjects with elevated PSA levels and/or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were consecutively enrolled from July 2011 through July 2014. All subjects underwent MRI prostate and TRUSGB. Subjects with normal MRI scans (Pi-rads 1, 2) underwent TRUSGB only, following the Vienna Nomogram; each equivocal (Pi-rads 3) or suspicious lesion (Pirads 4-5), was additionally biopsied using two cores. : Of 168 men, 69 (41.1%) had PCa. TRUSGB detected 60 cases of PCa (35.7 %) and 9 additionally cases of PCa were detected only by MRGB. Th e mp-MRI was equivocal for PCa (Pi-rads 3) in 46 subjects and suspicious (Pi-rads 4, 5) in 40 cases. Among these, TRUSGB detected PCa with Gleason score \u22657 in 75 % (Pi-rads 3) and 77.8 % (Pi-rads 4, 5) of the cases respectively. MRGB detected PCa with Gleason score \u22657 in 88.9 % (Pi-rads 3) and 90 % (Pi-rads 4, 5) of the cases respectively. Th e estimated NPV of MRGB for Pi-rads 3, and Pi-rads 4-5 lesions was 89% and 97.5 % respectively. : mpMRI followed by selective biopsy seems to improve the diagnosis of intermediate and high risk PCa compared to standard TRUSPB.Template-Guided Saturation Prostate Biopsy Effectively Detects Clinically Signifi cant Cancer That Is Diffi cult to Detect by Conventional Randomized BiopsyAndo T, Mori K, Nomura T, Sato F, Mimata HOita University, Yufu, JapanIntroduction and Objective: In many cases with suspected prostate cancer based on clinical fi ndings, the cancer is not detected by conventional randomized biopsy. When we repeat a biopsy in patients in whom cancer was not detected by conventional randomized biopsy, we perform a targeted prostate biopsy in combination with real-time virtual sonography (RVST-PBx), which allows real-time observation of fused images obtained with transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in patients with positive MRI fi ndings. Meanwhile, in patients without positive MRI fi ndings, we perform a template-guided saturation prostate biopsy (sPBx). Th e performance and signifi cance of these biopsy methods are reported herein. and Methods: Th is study included patients who underwent RVSTPBx or sPBx between August 2010 and February 2015 because their prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA) levels remained high or increased despite no evidence of cancer being detected by systematic prostate biopsy. Each biopsy was perineally performed in patients in the lithotomy position under lumbar anesthesia, and TRUS was combined with real-time tissue elastography (RTE), which visualizes the hardness of the prostate. As for RVSTPBx, 3-to 5-core MRI/TRUS-RTE fusion biopsies were performed in addition to conventional 12-core randomized biopsy. In sPBx, 1 core/ml of prostate tissue was collected by employing a template. Patient characteristics, cancer detection rates, cancer sites, and pathological fi ndings were evaluated according to each method. : RVSTPBx was performed in 14 patients with a mean age of 72 years, PSA level of 8.25 ng/ml, one previous biopsy and 16 biopsy cores. Meanwhile, sPBx was performed in 53 patients with a mean age of 69 years, PSA level of 12.7 ng/ml, 1.45 previous biopsies and 46.3 biopsy cores. Cancer was detected in 6 (42.9%) and 34 (64.2%) patients, respectively. In the patients undergoing RVSTPBx, 12 (24%) of the total 50 targeted biopsy cores were positive, while 13 (7.8%) of the total 167 cores of conventional randomized biopsy were positive. Out of 16 cores in total collected from the central zone by targeted biopsy, only one core was positive. Two patients (33%) met the criteria for active surveillance described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. In the patients undergoing sPBx, out of 118 cores in which cancer was detected, 82 cores (70%) were collected from the central zone. Two patients (5.9%) met the criteria for active surveillance described in the NCCN guidelines. No notable complications occurred in the patients undergoing either RVSTPBx or sPBx. : Both RVSTPBx and sPBx were shown to be eff ective test methods for increasing cancer detection rates. Our results suggest that more peripheral zone cores should be tested in patients with positive MRI fi ndings, and that more central zone cores should be tested in patients without positive MRI fi ndings. SPBx eff ectively detects clinically signifi cant cancer that is diffi cult to detect by conventional randomized biopsy.Introduction and Objective: Elastography is an imaging technique in which the diff erences in tissue stiff ness can be visualized. One of the problems for prostate cancer detection is false-positive results in patients with prostate hyperplasia. In this study, the tissue elastic modulus (Young's modulus) of the prostate gland was directly measured in prostatectomy specimens to compare with the results of elastography. Th is study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hitachi General Hospital. and Methods: Patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with a tumor diameter of \u226510 mm based on preoperative imagings were included. All patients provided written informed consent. Elastography was performed before each operation. Specimens were stored at 4\u00baC and delivered under refrigerated conditions. Sections were sliced at a 1-cm thickness before fi xation, with the lesion at the center. Each local area in the lesion or surrounding tissue was compressed using a stiff ness testing apparatus (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA) to measure the elastic modulus. Based on histopathological fi ndings, the compressed areas were classifi ed as normal gland in peripheral zone, normal gland in transitional zone, or cancerous tissue, and the tissue elastic modulus was calculated. Sections pathologically considered to have no cancer were excluded from the analysis.Results: Th e elastic modulus was measured in 14 patients. Th e mean tissue elastic modulus was 2.36 (range: 1.19-3.58) kPa for normal gland, 5.13 (range: 3.35-6.24) kPa for hyperplasia, 3.81 (range: 1.72-7.01) kPa for cancer ofG3+4, 5.17 (range: 4.78-5.52) kPa for cancer of G4+3, and 7.63 (range: 5.08-10.0) kPa for cancer of G3+5 and 4+5. Elastography could detect lesions of G8 or higher.",

Excluded 30 cases of repeat biopsy, and included 591 cases, whose medical records could be checked, in the study. Prostate cancer 224 cases, non-prostate cancer 367 cases. Th e ages, PSAs and Gleason scores distribution of prostate cancer patients was analyzed. Calculated the PSAD and PSAV if possible. : Most prostate cancer patients got diagnosis over 60y, the diagnostic peak was 70 to 79 (54.5%), and most PSA was above 10ng/ml (66.1%). Th e Gleason scores was mainly below 7. TPSA (AUC=0.723, P<0.001) all had good effi cacy in diagnosis of prostate cancer. TPSA (r=0.433, P<0.001), PSAD (r=0.432, P<0.001) and PSAV (r=0.445, P=0.004) of prostate cancer patients was positively correlated with the Gleason scores.

TPSA, f/T, PSAD and PSAV all isn't correlated with the Gleason scores (P>0.05), but PSAD may tend to be correlated with the Gleason scores (r=0.330, P<0.10). : TPSA, f/T and PSAD all can be used for prostate cancer early diagnosis. PSAV and PSAD is correlated with the Gleason scores of the tumor, and may be help for the assessment of tumor progression.In the PSA gray zone, f/T and PSAD is all help for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Th e aim of this study was to compare serum testosterone and prostate specifi c antigen (PSA) levels of these same two groups of patients in a sub-Saharan African population. and Methods: One hundred and thirteen male patients (aged \u226540years) who presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and/or indications for prostate biopsy were recruited. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for serum testosterone and PSA. Prostate sizes were measured and PSA densities calculated before trans-rectal prostate biopsies were performed. : Fift y-four patients (47.8%) were diagnosed of prostate adenocarcinoma aft er prostate biopsy (and histology) while fi ft y-nine patients (52.2%) were grouped as patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Serum testosterone values were lower in the prostate cancer group (23.09\u00b12.31nMol/L versus 24.37\u00b11.94nMol/L in the BPH group) but this diff erence was statistically insignifi cant (p=0.671). Serum testosterone also did not diff er signifi cantly with Gleason grade and Gleason score in the subgroup of patients with prostate cancer. Serum PSA and PSA density (PSAD) values were signifi cantly higher in men with prostate cancer and in cancer patients with Gleason grade (\u22654) and Gleason score (\u22658). As an additional fi nding, when all patients were analyzed irrespective of diagnosis, the group of patients with serum PSA values \u226519ng/ml had signifi cantly lower serum testosterone levels when compared to those with serum PSA level <19ng/ml. Th is additional fi nd-ing could not be replicated within the diff erent groups of patients (BPH and prostate cancer) when they were split in the same manner into two groups. : Serum testosterone levels of patients with prostate cancer did not statistically diff er from those of patients with BPH. However, serum testosterone was found to be lower in those with high serum PSA values (above 19ng/ml) regardless of the fi nal diagnosis. Further research and studies with larger sample sizes are needed to explore this fi nding.Introduction and Objective:Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is an emerging technique aiming to improve upon the diagnostic sensitivity of prostate biopsy. Variance in interpretation and application of techniques means results may vary. Th ere is likely a learning curve to establish consistent reporting of mpMRI. Th is study aims to review current literature supporting the diagnostic utility of mpMRI when compared to radical prostatectomy (RP) and template transperineal biopsy (TTPB) specimens. Data suggests that compared to RP and TTPB specimens the sensitivity of mpMRI for prostate cancer (PCa) detection is 80-90% and the specifi city for suspicious lesions is between 50-90%. mpMRI has an increasing role for prostate cancer diagnosis, staging and directing management toward improving patient outcomes.and Methods: A systematic literature search, based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines of databases including Medline via OVID, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ERIC via Pro-Quest was undertaken in March 2015. Keywords included: prostate, cancer, diagnosis, multiparametric, MRI, prostatectomy, transperineal in the form \"((((((prostate) AND cancer) AND diagnosis) AND multiparametric) AND mri) AND prostatectomy) OR transperineal\". Of the 1737 publications were initially identifi ed 47 were broadly relevant and 12 articles selected for detailed comparison. : Twelve relevant publications were identifi ed and compared. Th e sensitivity and specifi city of mp-MRI reported in the literature is approximately 80-90% and 50-90% when compared to RP and TTPB specimens. Numerous confounding variables were also reported including heterogeneity of MRI sequences, diff ering patient populations and radiologist experience. : mpMRI has an increasing role for prostate cancer diagnosis, staging and directing management toward improving patient outcomes. Th e sensitivity and specifi city of mpMRI reported in the 35th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2015 ABSTRACT BOOK literature is approximately 80-90% and 50-90% when compared to RP and TTPB specimens. Th is is less than what some expect, possibly refl ecting a learning curve for the technique of mpMRI. Does Specifi c Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Elevate the Risk of Prostate Cancer? Kim J, Sung H, Han D, Lee S Introduction and Objective: Despite the general fears linking Lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) with prostate cancer, the association between LUTS and prostate cancer detection rate is not much discovered yet. We investigated whether each specifi c symptoms of LUTS are related to the elevated odds of prostate cancer detection by evaluating the correlation of the each subscales of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) refl ecting the severity of specifi c LUTS with the cancer detection of a multi (\u226510)-core transrectal prostate biopsy. and Methods: From July 2007 to Jan 2013, 3,267 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsies due to elevated PSA levels ranging between 2.5 and 30 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal exams (DREs). Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis was used to assess the association of each symptoms of LUTS and prostate cancer detection. Th e predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve.",

Routine use of MRI for PCa was started since 2012, hence the study population was divided into two groups G1(Before  MRI, 2008 -2011) and G2 (Aft er MRI, 2012 -2014. We compared the TTMB results between two groups for the rates of GS upgrading (GS \u2265 7) and upstaging (bilateral) as compared to initial and detection of clinically signifi cant caner (maximum cancer core length (MCCL) \u2265 4 mm and/or Gleason grade \u2265 3 + 4). : Th e clinical and biopsy characteristics of G1 and G2 are shown inTable 1. MRI was performed in 82.1% patients in G2. TTMB detected cancer in G1 -64 (65%) and G2 -52 (77.6%) patients.

Transperineal template prostate biopsy (TMP) is gaining popularity as a diagnostic modality for prostate cancer. We aim to present our data for TMP performed on patients with elevated PSA and previous negative TRUS guided biopsy. and Methods: Prospective analysis of retrospectively collected data on patients undergoing TMP at Bart's and the London NHS Trust between 2009 and 2014. A total of 327 cases were analysed aft er exclusion of cases with unavailable histology. : Mean age of patients at TMP was 65 years (45 -83) with 5.2% undergoing their fi rst biopsy (17/327) and at least 11.9% for restaging (39/327). Mean corrected PSA was 13.9 (0.05 -132) and average of 38 cores taken per biopsy. Our TMP histology demonstrates a signifi cant cancer detection rate of 37% (121/327) with majority of the previous negative TRUS biopsies attributing to larger prostates. Fift y-seven percent of cancers were detected in the anterior zone (AZ) but only 9% were limited only to AZ.

TTMB Outcomes ative TRUS biopsies (\u22654) is rather low but we cannot comment on its clinical signifi cance. and Objective: As the number of patients with low-volume, low-grade localised prostate cancer (PCa) increased, less invasive focal therapies have been introduced based on the accumulated pathological and clinical fi ndings aft er radical prostatectomy. We previously reported that radical transurethral resection of prostate cancer (TUR-PCa) could be a radical therapy against localised PCa. We examined our data to evaluate whether focal TUR-PCa could be a viable focal therapy. and Methods: We analysed the distribution of cancer foci in 209 patients treated with radical TUR-PCa. And clinical results of 79 patients with unilateral PCa were studied because such patients seemed to be the most suitable candidates of focal TUR-PCa.In additional 16 patients we made a preliminary study of focal TUR-PCa. We radically resected the aff ected one lobe with the unaff ected lobe being resected less vigorously, or we radically resected both lobes except for the prostate tissues near the neurovascular bundle. : Pathological study revealed there were cancer foci near the neurovascular bundle bilaterally in 35%, unilaterally in 39% and no cancer bilaterally in 26%, suggesting the possibility of focal TUR-PCa.Patients' age ranged from 58 to 91 years and preoperative PSA, 0.70 to 17.30 ng/mL. At the fi nal follow-up, there were 75 (94.9%) patients with stable PSA levels: PSA\u22640.01, 40 cases; \u22640.02, 12; \u22640.03, 5; \u22640.04, 5; \u22640.1, 5; \u22641.0, 8. PSA failure developed in 4 (5.1%). Th e actuarial biological non-recurrence rate was 98.2% for the pathological stage pT2a-b at 88 months and 90.5% for pT2c at 84 months. Concerning the 16 patients treated by focal TUR-PCa, the follow-up period ranged from 3 to 53 months (median, 22.0). Postoperative PSA was stable between 0.007 and 0.406 ng/mL. No patients suff ered from urinary incontinence. Bladder neck contracture developed in only 1 patient and favorable results were obtained concerning the erectile function. : Focal TUR-PCa was considered to be a promising option among focal therapies against localized PCa because of possible advantages of both cancer control and quality of life. A longer follow-up results will be presented. and Objective:We investigated about the change of the renal function for prostate cancer patients who discontinued ADT. and Methods: Between 2009 and 2014, among 121 patients that performed prostate biopsy in our institute and were diagnosed prostate cancer pathologically and received ADT over 6 months, 60 patients who underwent the radiotherapy on stage B and C were statistically examined retrospectively. Th e renal function was assessed using estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR.) Th e \u0394eGFR was calculated by (posttreatment eGFR-pretreatment eGFR)/pretreatment eGFR \u00d7100). Th e discontinuing group was defi ned only for 6 months with ADT and the continuing group was defi ned for 12 months with ADT. We analyzed statistically about age, the \u0394eGFR at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, PSA, testosterone, hemoglobin, stage, Gleason score, comorbidity, body mass index, heart rate, cardio-thoracic ratio. : A total of 60 patients (discontinuing group: n= 23, continuing group: n=37) were analyzed. All patients underwent the radiotherapy aft er ADT for 6 months. Th e median hemoglobin was 14g/dl (range10.8-17.1g/ dl) in discontinuing group and 14.8 g/dl (range 12.6-16.8g/dl) in continuing group, respectively (P=0.0415).

However, whether degarelix can reduce acute genitourinary toxicity associated with irradiation when used as neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains unclear. Th e aim of this study was to evaluate the effi cacy of degarelix as neoadjuvant ADT followed by radiation therapy in the control of acute genitourinary toxicity compared to LHRH agonist. and Methods: Between May 2005 and May 2014, a total of 355 patients who had received neoadjuvant ADT for intermediate-to high-risk prostate cancer followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were enrolled in this study. Of these, 25 patients were treated with degarelix and 330 with LHRH agonist. Both groups received neoadjuvant ADT in combination with antiandrogen agents for 6 months prior to IMRT. Propensity-score matching was performed using clinical variables, including age, prostate-specifi c antigen level, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, D' Amico risk stratifi cation, prostate volumes, history of diabetes mellitus, pre-treatment use of alpha-1 blockers, radiation dose per fraction (2 or 3 Gy/fraction) and pre-treatment frequency of nocturnal urination. Genitourinary toxicity was estimated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 guidelines and acute toxicity was defi ned as any toxicity developing within 3 months aft er the end of radiation therapy. : Propensity-score matching resulted in 23 patients in each group. Th e matched cohort showed no signifi cant diff erences in clinical variables between groups. In the matched cohort, acute genitourinary toxicity was detected at a signifi cantly lower rate in the degarelix group than in the LHRH agonist group (39.1% vs. 69.6%, p=0.038). Post-treatment frequency of nocturnal urination was also signifi cantly lower in the degarelix group than in the LHRH agonist group (2.21\u00b10.27 vs. 3.34\u00b10.27, p=0.005). : Th e results of our study suggests that degarelix might reduce acute genitourinary toxicity UP.270,Table 1.UP.270,Figure 1.35th CONGRESS OF THE SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 INTERNATIONALE D'UROLOGIE -SIU 2015 ABSTRACT BOOK associated with IMRT compared to LHRH agonist, and might be useful as neoadjuvant ADT followed by irradiation.",

Th e mean age was 69 years (range 43 to 86). A total of 1083 patients had newly diagnosed prostate cancer, with 724 patients having complete data i.e. PSA, TRUS biopsy and MR. Staging for this analysis was determined by the MR report. : Multivariate analysis showed a signifi cant effect in T (p<0.05), N (p<0.05) and M (p<0.001) staging in relation to PSA and GS. Th ere was also significant interaction between T and M staging (p<0.05). In Univariate analysis, GS and PSA showed an increase with T staging up to T2C stage (p<0.05), whereas N staging showed a non-signifi cant eff ect on GS while giving a signifi cant eff ect on PSA (p<0.05).

Seventy-two percent of men (85 patients) were graded as having strong PFM strength pre-operatively, 14% (17 patients) were graded as moderate and 11% weak (13 patients). Th ree men were noted to have inappropriate PFM use. Weak PFM strength at 4 weeks correlated with incontinence as expected. Th ere was no signifi cant relationship between Gleason score, T-stage or pre-op PFM strength and post-op PFM strength. Younger men with weak PFM strength at 1 week were more likely to have improved strength at 4 weeks. : PFM strength is an important factor in urinary incontinence post-RARP. Our data demonstrated no signifi cant pre-operative predictors of weak PFM strength post-operatively. Studies of larger cohorts of men with longer follow-up could shed more light on risk factors for pelvic fl oor weakness post-op.Introduction and Objective: T1c prostate cancer cases have clinically inapparent tumor on digital rectal examination. However, prostate cancer is subsequently detected on needle biopsy. Generally biopsies are performed due to a suspicious prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA). PSA is a known clinical predictor of extracapsular disease. We aim to assess the relationship between PSA and pathological T stage in cases of T1c prostate cancer. and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry data was conducted. A total of 1,544 cases of T1c prostate cancer with recorded PSA at diagnosis were identifi ed. Date of diagnosis ranged from 2009-2013. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) to assess the relationship between PSA and pathological T stage. : Overall 30% of T1c cases have extracapsular (T3/T4) pathology; 19.5% of T1c cases with PSA 0-5ng/dL have extracapsular disease. Th ereaft er the OR for extra capsular disease increases with PSA level. Compared to a PSA of 0-5, PSA 5-10 had an OR of 1.9, PSA 10-15 had an OR of 2.7, PSA 15-20 had an OR 5.5 and PSA >20 had an OR of 6.2 for extra capsular disease. (Table 1). : Using a Victorian population, we have demonstrated that the odds of extracapsular disease increases with PSA in cases of T1c prostate cancer. Our results are similar to existing international data. Partin tables covering a similar period (2006-2013) found that 46% of patients with T1c disease and PSA >10 had extracapsular disease. We also found 46% of our patients with T1c disease and PSA >10 had extracapsular disease. Th is study highlights the importance of PSA in determining the signifi cance of T1c disease. Introduction and Objective: A digital rectal examination forms (DRE) part of the core assessment for prostate cancer both for screening and staging purposes. An abnormal DRE increases the likelihood of prostate malignancy, especially in the context of an elevated prostate-specifi c-antigen (PSA). However, its utility is limited. It misses a signifi cant proportion of cancers, whilst detecting mainly higher stage cancers. One study involving 565 DREs, concludes only a 52% concordance for T2 suspected clinical disease. We aim to measure the ability of the clinical T stage to correctly identify pathological stage. and Methods: A retrospective analysis of Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry data was conducted comparing recorded clinical and pathological UP.301, Table 1.

Comparison of Clinical and Pathological Characteristics between Patients with and without Intravesical Recurrence for UTUC after Renal Transplantation (n = 37) Introduction and Objective: Extirpative treatment of Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC)has long been the standard of care regardless of tumor grade. We herein stratify oncologic outcomes based on tumor grade with implications for the role of systemic chemotherapy. We present long-term oncologic outcomes of all patients treated with nephroureterectomy for UTUC over an 18 year time period. and Methods: All patients (N=114) were treated by a single surgeon with extirpative surgery for UTUC as a primary treatment. One hundred and three (90%) underwent laparoscopic nephroureterectomy via a retroperitoneal approach, with transurethral incision of the ureteric orifi ce and then open bladder-cuff excision through a Gibson incision. Th e open surgical was used in 11 (10%) cases. Data was prospectively collected and concurrent outpatient follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier methodology to calculate overall survival (OS), cancer specific survival (CSS), and metastasis free survival (MFS). : Th e mean age of patients was 71.8 (range 46-94), 67 male (59%) and mean Charlson Comorbidity Index of 5.6 (range 0-13). Mean follow-up time was 64.0 months (range 1-186) with median overall survival 107.1 months. Twenty-seven patients (23.7%) with low grade tumors, treated with nephroureterectomy, had 2-, 5-, and 10-year CSS of 100, 92, and 92%. In contrast, 87 (76.3%) with high grade tumors had a lower 2-, 5-, and 10-year CSS of 68, 58 and 32% (p<0.0003). Likewise, MFS was worse for high grade disease at 2-, 5-, and 10-years of 69, 60, and 39% compared to low grade disease of 93, 93, and 93% (p<0.005). : Tumor grade is a signifi cant predictor of OS, CSS, and MFS in patients treated with nephroureterectomy for UTUC. Extirpative therapy alone was found to result in relatively poor long-term CSS in patients with high grade disease, underscoring the need for adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies.How Dependent Loops along Thoracostomy and Urinary Drainage Tubes Impede Drainage: An ex-vivo Model and Two Clinical Trials Garcia M 1 , Bullock T 1 , Tasian G 1 , Eisenberg M 2 , Hill A 3",

All patients were assessed with voiding symptom, urofl owmetry, urodynamic study before the operation. And 1 month aft er the operation, all patients were reassessed with voiding symptoms and urofl owmetry for comparison. : Th ere were 66 patients (41.3%), 94 patients (58.7%) retrospectively. Th ere were no signifi cant diff erences in age, body mass index (BMI), storage symptoms. Preoperative maximal fl ow rate (Qmax) was lower in group A than in group B (13.1 vs. 23.8 ml/s, p<0.001). Preoperative voided volume and post void residual (PVR) were comparable in both groups. BCI was lower in group A than in group B (85.1 vs. 140.7, p<0.001). Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP), maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP), PdetQmax were comparable in both groups. Operation success rate were comparable in both groups. Diff erences Introduction and Objective: One of the most bothersome complications infl uencing the quality of life aft er radical prostatectomy (RP) is urinary incontinence. Many studies have reported that urinary incontinence aft er RP improves gradually over time. To examine chronological changes in urethral and bladder functions before, immediately aft er, and 1 year aft er robot-assisted RP (RARP), urodynamic studies were prospectively performed. and Methods: Sixty-three consecutive patients underwent pressure-fl ow studies, urethral pressure profi les, and abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) tests 1-2 days before, immediately aft er, and 1 year aft er RARP. : Th e mean bladder compliance was 28.3 mL/cmH2O before RARP; it worsened to 16.3 mL/ cmH2O immediately aft er RARP and recovered to 27.1 mL/cmH2O at 1 year. Th e mean detrusor pressure at maximum fl ow rate was 61.9 cmH2O before RARP; it decreased to 34.3 cmH2O immediately aft er RARP and remained at 35.6 cmH2O at 1 year. Th e mean maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) was 84.2 cmH2O before RARP; it decreased to 33.4 cmH2O immediately aft er RARP and recovered to 63.0 cmH2O at 1 year. Intrinsic sphincter defi ciency (ISD) evaluated by the ALPP test was observed in 53 patients immediately aft er RARP, although no patient showed ISD before RARP. ISD remained in 7 patients at 1 year. Both ALPP and MUCP at 1 year were significant factors for continence in multivariate analysis.",

Importantly, patients who had discontinued bicalutamide because of adverse events were excluded.Results: Of the 87 patients treated with alternative fl utamide therapy, prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA) levels decreased by >90% (Group A) in 18 patients (21%), by 50-90% (Group B) in 15 patients (17%), and by 0-50% (Group C) in 18 patients (21%), but increased by >0% in 36 patients (41%). Th e median duration of response was 22.5, 8.5, and 3.5 months for Groups A, B and C, respectively. Th e duration of response for 15 patients (17%) was more than 12 months. Aft er alternative fl utamide therapy, decreased PSA levels of >50% were achieved in 11 of 25 patients (44%) with MAB nadir PSA levels of <0.2 ng/ mL, in 14 of 37 patients (38%) with MAB nadir PSA levels of 0.2 to 4 ng/mL, and in 8 of 25 patients (32%) with MAB nadir PSA levels of >4 ng/mL. During the observation period there were no severe side eff ects.Conclusion: Approximately 60% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer who relapsed aft er MAB with bicalutamide achieved a decrease in their PSA level with no severe side eff ects. Th e nadir PSA level during MAB, however, was not a predictor for the eff ectiveness of alternative fl utamide therapy. Th us, alternative fl utamide therapy is a reasonable treatment option for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Nevertheless, changing to another therapy should be considered in patients who achieve decreases in PSA levels of <50% with alternative fl utamide therapy, as the duration of response was relatively short in these patients.",

All of them were diagnosed prostate cancer by prostate biopsy pathologically and had taken ADT for at least 6 months. We assessed the renal function of 106 prostate cancer patients by using the eGFR and investigated the time-independent change rate of the eGFR (\u0394eGFR) aft er ADT. Th e \u0394eGFR was calculated by (post treatment eGFR-pretreatment eGFR)/pretreatment eGFR \u00d7100). Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were carried out to identify clinical covariates signifi cantly associated with the risk factors for renal dysfunction at 6 months later.Results: Th e incidence of the renal dysfunction at 6 months was 63% (67/106). Th e mean \u0394eGFR at 1, 3, 6 months were -0.9%, -3.3% and -2.2%, respectively (P=0.0678). Th e incidence of the renal dysfunction at 6 months was signifi cantly associated with the renal dysfunction at 1 month (P<0.0001), at 3 months (P<0.0001), hypertension (P=0.0017) and dyslipidemia (P=0.0288). Th e renal dysfunction at pretreatment with ADT did not aff ect the renal function 6 months later (P=0.3577).

Th e earlier renal dysfunction may cause the renal dysfunction at 6 months later. So, when the treatment of ADT began, it was thought that an examination of periodical renal function was necessary. Th e present results suggested that it was necessary to control the blood pressure and lipid for receiving ADT with prostate cancer.",

Baseline characteristics and pathological outcome were analyzed.Results: In analyzed cohort, mean age was 68.4\u00b19.1 years, median initial PSA was 7.6 ng/mL (range, 4.2-18.6), median prostate volume (PV) was 33.2 mL (range, 17.5-92.2) , and median volume of ROI was 1.11 mL (range 0.16-2.41). Of 16 patients, prostate cancer was detected in 9 (56%) patients by target biopsy and 8 (50%) patients by systematic biopsy. Patients with positive biopsy was likely to be higher PSA than men with negative biopsy (P= 0.039). Median ROI/PV was not signifi cant between them (2.35 vs. 2.51: positive vs. negative, P=0.491). Cancer detection rates per core between target and systematic biopsy were 49.9 and 22.2 %, respectively (P=0.012).Regarding pathological results, mean Gleason score of target biopsy was 2.8 compared with 2.1 of systematic biopsy, although which is not statistically signifi cant (P=0.158).Conclusion: MRI-TRUS fusion target biopsy is gradually spreading in Japan, since its higher cancer detection rate compared with conventional systematic biopsy.

In 158 men in the prospective study, the relative increase in recommendation for AS was 24% and absolute TR increase for AS was also 10% (41% to 51%). 18% of TR changed post-GPS and TR modality and/or intensity occurred in 26% of men (25 decreased; 14 increased; 2 equivocal).Conclusions: Both studies, conducted with diff erent methodologies, demonstrate that use of GPS provides meaningful change in TR and decisions in men with newly diagnosed PCa and results in a net increase in recommendation and/or adoption of AS. In the chart review study, TR changes appear to underestimate changes in actual treatment received and more GPS patients than baseline patients were assigned to AS supporting the clinical utility of GPS in the initial assessment and management of men with low risk PCa.",

Th e results were related to patient specifi c and clinico-pathologic data.Results: Patients with HCE (n=287) had a more aggressive grade Gleason score (GS) \u22657b, p<0.001)), a locally more advanced stage (\u2265pT3a, p<0.001), and lymph node metastasis (N+, p<0.001).

Reported high satisfaction with telephone follow-up (90% were either satisfi ed or very satisfi ed). Majority of patients found the length of the conversations to be 'just right' (93%) with a lesser majority expressing that the calls were always at times convenient to them (78%) and that they were always called when they were told they would be called (74%). Patients felt that the information given to them over the phone was always easy enough to understand (89%) and the majority felt that they always had the opportunity to ask questions during the conversations (81%). When asked whether they would prefer telephone follow-up or hospital follow-up, 79% of respondents reported that they would prefer telephone follow-up, citing convenience, time and privacy as the reasons for their preference. Twenty-one percent of patients would prefer hospital follow-up, reporting ease of understanding, not liking the telephone and preference for face to face contact.Conclusions: Telephone follow-up relieves pressure on the Outpatient Department, increases capacity, reduces waiting times and brings care closer to home.

All the subjects were evaluated by the face-to-face questionnaires of Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). A professional urologist was invited to measure their lengths of penis and volumes of testes. All the data were analyzed by SPSS version 13.0 soft ware.Results: A total of 1782 men aged from 18 to 70 years (30.99 \u00b1 6.60) were categorized into lifelong PE (LPE) (244 men), acquired premature ejaculation (APE) (440 men), variable PE (VPE) (727 men) and subjective PE (SPE) (371 men), respectively. Th ere was no signifi cant diff erence among the four PE subtypes except for the IELTs and the IIEF-5. Th e self-estimated IELT of SPE was signifi cant longer than that of other subtypes, and the similar case could be seen in IIEF-5. Th e highest percentage was found in APE (55.68%) for chronic prostatitis (CP) and in LPE (96.72%) for ED.Conclusion: VPE was the most common subtype, next APE, thirdly SPE and the least one is LPE. Consistent with the previous reports, we found that the incidence of CP in APE was the highest among all the four subtypes of PE, and CP was a signifi cant risk factor of APE but not for other subtypes. Th ere has always been controversial about the relationship between PE and ED. Th e results from our multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that ED was not only associated with PE, but also could be regarded as a risk factor of PE.

While, there were no signifi cant diff erence in fT (6.75 vs. 6.40 ng/mL, P = 0.328), TRT duration (498 vs. 557 days, P = 0.571), and TRT discontinuation rate (80.9 vs. 73.8%, P = 0.269) between two groups.Conclusion: Even though, LOH patients who had diagnosis of depression and underwent medical treatment such as antidepressant, TRT can be feasible approach for those patients. Majority of those LOH patients underwent mental health treatment at the same moment with TRT, which may not harm treatment effi cacy of TRT.",

Th e mean (range) stone diameter was 2.74 (0.8-5) cm. One hundred thirty-eight children (94%) had a solitary stone while nine (6%) had more than one stone. Th e main component of the stones were calcium oxalate in 70 patients (48.6%).Results: All children were stone-free aft er one PCCL; no recurrent stones developed. Th e mean (range) PCCL procedure time was 29.6 (12 to 48) min and intraoperative blood loss was scant. Perioperative complications were few. Th e mean (range) hospital stay was1.2 (1-3) days.Conclusions: Blind access PCCL (without any ultrasonic or fl uoroscopic guidance) is a facile and safe approach for removing stones in the pediatric bladder stones. Advantages include the lack of ionizing radiation, no need for opacifi cation by iodine contrast media and low relative cost. We recommend this minimally invasive technique for management of large bladder stones (larger than 1cm) in children.

Th e general condition of the patients except one was improved quickly aft er operation and discharged aft er 5.4 (\u00b15.75) days.Conclusion: Most obstructive uropathy due to calculi was in serious conditions to need immediate procedures and URS were safely and successfully performed under intravenous analgesics. In some of female patients, URS is well-tolerated even without analgesics. Prompt URS procedure with intravenous analgesics can recover these conditions with minimal morbidity.",

Demographic data and variables (stent/catheter, indication, side, success/failure -including reasons for failure) were collected. Patients were asked to subjectively rate the level of pain at the end of the procedure.Th e data has been collected and tabulated into an Ex-cel\u00ae worksheet.Results: A total of 301 procedures (average 37.6 per year) were performed with age range from 14 to 94 years (average: 47.8 years).

Staghorn calculi were treated in 9 patients including 2 cases of bilateral staghorn calculi, resulting in a total of 11 staghorn renal units treated by ambulatory PCNL. All 9 patients were discharged home uneventfully 2-6 hours postoperatively. Th ere were no major postoperative complications, emergency room visits, hospital readmissions or deaths. Th e stone-free rate was 64%, with 7 of the 11 renal units being stone-free at follow-up.Conclusion: Th is small series represents the largest series of ambulatory PCNL for staghorn calculi to date. In very carefully selected patients, PCNL for staghorn calculi on a completely outpatient basis appears safe and may be feasible. Further research on ambulatory PCNL for staghorn calculi is required prior to widespread adoption by urologists. Introduction and Objective: Th e most diffi cult aspect of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is frequently the renal puncture. Most are performed under fl uoroscopic control. Parallax, the assessment of the displacement of an object when viewed along two lines of sight, is the concept which allows the surgeon to gauge the 3D relationship of the needle to the kidney from a 2D fl uoroscopic image. Whilst most urologists appreciate successful access correlates with both kidney and stone images moving in unison on rotation of the C Arm (or \"reverse parallax\"), confusion oft en arises with unsuccessful attempts in relating how to amend the puncture with the radiological fi ndings.",

Univariate analysis of variables associated with survival end points was performed with Cox proportional hazards regression.Results: Median follow-up of our cohort was 11.0 years (IQR 4.3-18.2) with a median overall survival of 13.9 years. At presentation 92.2% (n=47) of men had localized disease. Interval completion hemiscrotectomy (performed aft er initial unplanned diagnostic surgery) was done in 25 men, in which 25% (n=5) had residual disease present. Local recurrence (LR) occurred in 12 patients (23.5%). Median time from diagnosis to LR was 15months. Univariate analysis showed presence of positive margins at diagnostic surgery (HR 4.81, p=0 .047) and upfront/ completion hemiscrotectomy (HR 0.21, p=0 .02) to be signifi cant variables. At last follow-up, 7/12 men (58.3%) with LR were alive and disease free, 4 developed metastatic disease with 3 PTS-related mortalities, and 1 deceased of other cancer type. Metastasis was present in 13 men (25.5%), with median time to metastasis 18mo, and median to from metastasis to death 11.4mo. At last follow-up, 21.6% (n=11) of the patients were deceased with 7 cases attributable to PTS. On univariate analysis, there were no significant variables for metastatic disease, and age (HR 1.04, CI 1.00-1.08, p=0.02) and non-localized disease at presentation (HR 5.17, p=0 .02) were signifi cant for overall survival.Conclusion: In our cohort of PTS patients with median 11 years follow-up, aggressive treatment of local recurrence (23.5%) resulted in good disease free survival for 7 of 12 men. Completion hemiscrotectomy, particularly for positive margin disease, may decrease local recurrence.",

Multivariate analysis showed that perinephric fat stranding, higher pT stage (\u2265 T3), lymph node involvement of cancer, and positive surgical margin were independent prognostic factors of cancer-specifi c survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.007, p < 0.001 and p = 0.029, respec-tively).

Work-up confi rmed the diagnosis without evidence of metastatic disease and the patient went on to have an open transperitoneal nephroureterectomy. Laparoscopic approach was initially attempted but abandoned due to dense adhesions thought secondary to previous open bowel resection for colorectal cancer. A fl ank incision was used; there were no specifi c operative complications and the specimen was easily retrieved without manipulation or rupture. Post-operative recovery was unremarkable and histological analysis of the tumour revealed a non-invasive high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma at the right pelviureteric junction with clear resection margins. Approximately 9 months post-operatively the patient re-presented with a rapidly enlarging mass at the fl ank incision. Imaging demonstrated a circumscribed hypodense mass within the muscle layers at the site of the scar and biopsy revealed poorly diff erentiated carcinoma. Surgery to excise the mass was subsequently performed and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a lack of staining for MSH6.Results: Abdominal wall metastasis following open nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma is rare, with only one case reported previously. Given patient's previous history of colorectal cancer, strong family history and immunohistochemical fi ndings are highly suggestive of Lynch syndrome. Incisional site tumour recurrence following surgery for urological malignancy is a very rare complication, with only a handful of case reports existing, mostly relating to port-site metastasis following laparoscopic surgery. Wound recurrence following open surgery is an extremely uncommon but recognised event, more frequent in certain gynaecological and general surgical malignancies.

Logistic regression was performed to analyze a correlation between de novo UI and other factors such as age, prostate volume, retrieved tissue weight, operative time, and the fi rst post-void residual (PVR) urine volume immediately aft er removing postoperative urethral catheter. Urethral catheter was removed aft er bladder instillation with a 200 ml normal saline via urethral catheter, and PVR urine volume was estimated immediately aft er the fi rst postoperative self-voiding. All defi nitions of UI corresponded to recommendations of the International Continence Society.Results: Aft er HoLEP, 44 patients (31.2%) had de novo UI, most of which resolved within 1-6 months; 34 had stress UI, 6 had urgency UI, and 4 had mixed UI. Age and PVR urine volume were signifi cantly higher in UI group than non-UI group (75.09 \u00b1 6.82 vs. 72.01 \u00b1 8.04 years; P = 0.029, 81.88 \u00b1 67.13 vs. 30.15 \u00b1 23.56 ml, P < 0.001). In a logistic linear regression analysis, only PVR urine volume was an independent predictor of de novo UI aft er HoLEP.

Th e preoperative evaluations included a complete medical history, a female bladder questionnaires, urogynecological examination and urodynamic test with valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP). Th e main outcome measures were perioperative morbidity, postoperative SUI, persistent or de novo urge incontinence, postoperative complication and voiding dysfunction. Th e objective and subjective success rate were evaluated by visual analogue score and global patient impression questionnaire at 1, 3, 6 months. Th e mean follow-up period was 36\u00b114 mo (range, 12-90 mo).Results: Th e incidence of SPARC related morbidity was similar in both groups. For the operation outcome results, in younger group (258 patients) there were 232 cases of cure (89.9%), 20 cases of improvement (7.8%), and 6 cases of fail (2.3%) and in elderly group (41 patients) there were 36 cases of cure (87.8%), 4 cases of improvement (9.8%), a case of fail (2.4%) (p>0.05). Th e operation satisfaction rate of patients was 93.7% in the younger group and 90.2% in the elderly group (p>0.05). A total of 279 patients (93.3%) would like to recommend the SPARC procedure to others.

Aft er their resection, intradural anastomosis of donor root to the recipient distal root stub was performed. Th ose roots whose stimulation elicited the largest response were always selected. Aft er 8-16 months (mean 12 months), the artifi cial refl ex arc's function was examined (to date in 11 rabbits). Under general anaesthesia, skin segments L5-S1 were peripherally stimulated and then the spinal root above the anastomosis was stimulated. Detrusor response was measured using an EMG strip electrode and intravesical pressure (Pves) monitoring and sphincter response using an EMG needle electrode. A root sample from under the anastomosis was resected for histology.Results: Electromyography confi rmed detrusor response to peripheral skin stimulation in 7 (64%) animals and sphincter response in 8 (73%). Five (45%) animals displayed elevated intravesical pressure (Pves) up to 15 cm H2O. Root stimulation induced detrusor and sphincter EMG response in 7 (64%) and 9 (82%) rabbits, respectively, and 4 (36%) animals displayed increased Pves up to 24 cm H2O. Micturition was not induced in any animals. With confi rmed detrusor contraction (EMG, elevated Pves), external sphincter activity was never inhibited. Somatic-to-autonomic anastomosis creation was histologically confi rmed in all samples. Hind limb paresis occurred in 2 (18%) animals and spinal lesion in 3 (27%).Conclusion: Lumbar-to-sacral-nerve rerouting is a technically manageable method with donor root fibres verifi ably joining recipient roots. Only in a limited percentage of cases, however, can the method achieve positive functional results, i.e. demonstrable detrusor contractions and elevated intravesical pressure.

Th e anatomic structure of the proximal 2/3 urethra was found to be quite homogenous, which surrounded by circular smooth muscle. Th e connective tissue constituted with abundant collagen fi bers and vascular plexus was most voluminous in the distal 1/3 urethra, and relatively richer near the bladder neck. UPP had 2 pressure zones: high pressure zone corresponding to the distal 1/3 urethra and low pressure zone corresponding to the proximal 2/3 urethra.

Th e initial treatment consisted of self-catheterization (33 pts -49%), \u03b1 blockers (20 pts -30%), suprapubic cystostomy (6 pts -9%), double voiding (6 pts -9%) and neurostimulation (2 pts -3%).Conclusion: Th e most common causes for UAB include neurogenic conditions and obstructive symptoms associated with aging. Th ere are no specifi c symptoms to support this diagnosis but some might suggest it stronger than others. Urodynamic evaluation is mandatory to assess the parameters of this condition.",

            "text": "A retrospective chart review was conducted on consecutive urodynamic studies performed for voiding dysfunction between 2012 and 2014, to identify patients with detrusor underactivity. Underactive bladder was defi ned as bladder contractility index less than 100. Charts and urodynamic tracing were examined for patient demographics, suspected risk factors, presenting symptoms, urodynamic parameters, and treatment undertaken.Results: Th e prevalence of Underactive bladder in this series was 23% (79/343). Average age was 59.2 (range 19-90). Women represented 68.4% (54/79) of patients. Th e most common reported symptoms were: urinary urgency (63.3%), weak stream (61.0%), straining (57.0%), nocturia (48.1%), and urinary frequency (46.8%). Prior pelvic surgery and prior back surgery was noted in 40.5% and 19.0%, respectively. Most common management was intermittent self-catheterization at 54.4%, followed by observation/conservative treatment at 25.3%, and sacral neuromodulation at 12.7%.Conclusion: Underactive bladder is common, yet precise diagnosis and treatment remains nebulous. Th ere exists signifi cant overlap in symptoms compared to other bladder disorders, and urodynamic evaluation is useful in determining those patients with impaired detrusor contractility. Th is will help prevent mismanagement of these patients with surgery or medical therapy that may worsen their condition. Th ere remains much work to be done to better understand this condition, and establish optimal management for patients.",

Comorbidity tools exist but aren't always used outside of studies. Clinicians may infer a patient's fi tness from the size of their notes. Th is is particularly apparent in multidisciplinary meetings when the patient, and sometimes the referring clinician, is absent. We aim to establish if any correlation exists between the thickness and weight of medical notes and patient comorbidity.",

Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlston Comorbidity Index (CCI).Results: Mean (and range): age 63 (19-93) years; thickness 4.2 (0.3-36.4) cm; weight 1770 (157-16874) g; CCI 1.6 (0-8). Male to female ratio 1:1. Pearson's correlation (r) between thickness and CCI was 0.27 (p=0.01). Th e correlation between weight and CCI was 0.25 (p=0.01). Regression analysis showed, an 8.5cm increase in thickness gives in a 1-point increase in CCI (p=0.01); and a 5000g increase in weight gives a 1-point increase in CCI (p=0.01).Conclusion: Th ere is a statistically signifi cant relationship between the thickness and weight of a patient's notes and their CCI (p=0.01), but the strength of this relationship is extremely weak (r=0.25 and 0.27). On average, an 8.5cm or 5kg diff erence in size has only a 1-point diff erence in CCI. Th is change may reduce the 10-year survival of a patient by as little as 5%. Size of notes is a highly misleading indicator of fi tness. Patients should have a formal comorbidity assessment before deciding treatment options.Did you know? SIU Academy...",
