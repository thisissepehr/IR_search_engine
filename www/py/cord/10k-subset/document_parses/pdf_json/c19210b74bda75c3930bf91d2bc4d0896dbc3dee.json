One of key benefits offered by plants as expression hosts is their lower costs compared to mammalian systems. Regarding economic evaluation of current plant-based platforms, production costs can be substantially reduced compared with those of traditional platforms (Tus\u00e9 et al 2014) . There have been two techno-economic case studies representing plant-made enzymes using tobacco host plants for diverse applications; human butyrylcholinesterase produced indoors for use as a medical countermeasure and cellulase produced in the field as a cellulosic biomass. Their analyses indicate that substantial cost advantages over alternative platforms can be achieved using plant systems, but these advantages are molecule/product-specific and depend on the relative cost efficiencies of alternative sources of the same product. Plantsourced cellulase can be produced for just under $7/kg. These costs compare favorably to minimum $10.6/kg cost of the same fungal-sourced product (all costs adjusted to 2013 U.S. dollars) (Tus\u00e9 et al 2014) . They also reported that butyrylcholinesterase using a transient expression plant system costs approximately $474/dose to manufacture, although its cost can be reduced to less than $200/dose in a toll-manufacturing facility. Most of the capital costs (~60%) and a significant portion of the operating costs (>70-75%) are associated with the recovery and purification steps. Considering that oral immunization is a beneficial approach in terms of costs, patient comfort, and protection of mucosal tissues, use of food-grade plants such as rice, carrot, maize, lettuce, and strawberry can lead to highly advantageous vaccines in terms of costs, easy administration, and safety (Rosales-Mendoza et al 2016).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 364, "end": 381, "text": "(Tus\u00e9 et al 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1130, "text": "(Tus\u00e9 et al 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Benefits of Plants for Production of Recombinant Proteins"}, {"text": "In addition to fast production and inherent safety due to lack of adventitious animal and human source agents, industrially relevant benefits of plant systems include proper post-translational modifications.

Economic viability of a production process depends on the yields of the product. The largest challenge facing recombinant protein systems is scaling up production of the biomass to meet demand. One approach to this problem is agroinfiltration, in which Agrobacterium tumefaciens is injected or vacuuminfiltrated into leaves so that leaf cells take up but do not integrate T-DNA into the nuclear genome, resulting in production of milligrams of protein within a few days (Tschofen et al. 2016 ). However, TMV-based vectors showed extremely inefficient Agrobacterium delivery, which was estimated at about one infection per 10 8 Agrobacterium cells. More recent work on vectors built from different tobamoviral strains, which encode replication proteins, has been more successful (Yamanaka et al. 2000) but still not efficient.

Inducible expression of recombinant proteins with deconstructed viral vectors and chemical inducers can be used for yield optimization, as it allows separation of the growth and production phases in manufacturing. The process is based on inducible release of viral RNA replicons from stably integrated DNA proreplicons after ethanol treatment in transgenic plants (Werner et al. 2011) . Two components, the replicon and cell-to-cell movement protein, are placed separately under the control of an inducible promoter to achieve tight control of replicon activation in uninduced transgenic plants. After induction by incubation for 24 h in ethanol vapor, transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) plants incorporating this double-inducible system demonstrated high (over 5,000 fold) RNA amplification, followed by high absolute levels of protein (up to 4.3 mg\u2044g of fresh biomass) (Werner et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 634, "end": 654, "text": "(Werner et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1176, "text": "(Werner et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "New Approaches to Challenges Facing Plant-based Recombinant Protein Production"}, {"text": "The platform has the combined advantages of a transient gene expression and stable gene transformation in plants. The technology, In Plant Activation (INPACT), is based on a two-cassette system, which is stably integrated into the host nuclear genome (Dugdale et al. 2013) . Expression of the gene of interest is activated by an ethanol spray, and there is negligible expression in the absence of the ethanol inducer molecule due to the unique split gene arrangement. In their experiment, Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun (N. tabacum cv Samsun) rather than N. benthamiana was used due to the potential of high biomass tobacco for field production. The INPACT system is based on the replication machinery of the tobacco yellow dwarf mastrevirus and is essentially a transient gene expression from a stably transformed plant. The INPACT cassette is uniquely arranged such that the gene of interest is split and only reconstituted in the presence of TYDV-encoded Rep/RepA proteins. Rep/RepA expression is under the control of the AlcA:AlcR gene switch, which is responsive to trace levels of ethanol. The authors reported that transgenic tobacco (N. tabacum cv Samsun) plants containing an INPACT cassette encoding the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter showed negligible background expression but accumulated very high GUS levels (up to 10% total soluble protein) throughout the plant within 3 days of 1% ethanol application. The INPACT gene expression platform is scalable, not host-limited, and has been used to express both therapeutic and industrial proteins. Thus, deconstructed viral vectors offer a set of versatile tools that can rapidly evaluate biologic candidates and then transition them to large-scale commercial manufacturing (Chen and Davis 2014) .

Post-translational modifications of proteins in plants are different from those in animal/ human cells. Glycosylation can affect protein structure, biological activity, and stability when the protein is injected as a drug (Strasser et al. 2014 ).

Therefore, in addition to the risk assessment framework of GM plants used as food/feed or processing, molecular farming plants with recombinant protein products raise new questions and concerns that trigger a need for further specific biosafety considerations due to the nature of recombinant genes (Sparrow et al. 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 598, "text": "(Jouzani and Tohidfar 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 900, "end": 921, "text": "(Sparrow et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Regulatory Challenges"}, {"text": "Risk of co-mingling and contamination of transgenic plants with recombinant genes can be reduced by using as target plants for molecular farming with other agriculturally important crops, non-food/feed crops, production cell suspension cultures in bioreactors, or strict physical agronomic confinement and containment.

However, approval of ELELYSO\u2122 by the U.S. FDA has opened a clear regulatory pathway for plant-made biologics, especially those derived from cultured plant cells. This regulatory pathway can be applied to the approval of recombinant proteins from whole plants. A predictable review process in this approval case can encourage large pharmaceutical companies to give attention to plant-made biologics (Chen and Davis 2016) . Pfizer entered into an agreement to license (Paul et al. 2015) . In Korea, a significant proportion of the public has a negative view of GM plants, and experimental field trials for very few GM events have only been recently allowed in ChunBook Province. Therefore, Korea has strict evaluation criteria for this technology and strict compliance measures to avoid potential risks to the environment or human and animal health. Under these circumstances, the public's opinion on cultivation of biologic-produced plants or consumption of plant-produced products has not been explored.

Further development and widespread success of this technology will be strongly influenced by the level of regulation and restrictions applied to molecular farming plants and their products.

Only several manufacturing facilities have been approved for the production of GMP-grade proteins in leafy crops such as tobacco, whereas some other facilities can manufacture GMPgrade proteins expressed in rice seeds for manufacturing platforms of recombinant proteins (Xu et al. 2012; Broz et al. 2013) . Since there are a limited number of GMP-compliant production facilities, a relatively small number of plantderived pharmaceutical products such as human serum albumin (Farran et al. 2002) and influenza vaccine (Shoji et al. 2011 ) are currently on the market or undergoing clinical development (Table 1) . However, several other companies have established commercial platforms for the production of non-pharmaceutical products to generate revenue without the lengthy and costly regulatory procedures required for clinical studies (Abiri et al. 2015) . These products range from veterinary pharmaceuticals, technical enzymes, and research reagents to media ingredients and cosmetic products (Table  1 ; Fig. 1 ). It has also been reported that transgenic silkworm lines, in which Spider (Araneus ventricosus) dragline silk (MaSp-2) protein is expressed as a part of fibroin fiber of silk, show high-toughness (Sylvester et al. 2011 ). Veterinary pharmaceuticals have received attention to reduce use of antibiotics in livestock production and thus the emergence of antibiotic-resistant and potentially zoonotic pathogens (Sack et al. 2015; Topp et al. 2016) . The production of recombinant vaccines by plants may help to reduce the burden of veterinary diseases, which cause major economic losses and in some cases affect human health (MacDonald et al. 2015) . These circumstances have encouraged the development of cost-effective, efficient, and scalable production and delivery platforms for veterinary pharmaceuticals (Rybicki et al. 2012; MacDonald et al. 2015) . Although the motivation is great, a knowledge gap exists between the ability to create and evaluate plant-based products in the laboratory and the ability to make these products ready for commercialization, including business planning, financing, and regulatory approval (MacDonald et al. 2015) .

The European Union (EU) is considered to have the toughest and most stringent legislation on GM products and commodities in the world. Although the commercialization of medicinal or industrial products produced has yet to emerge in Europe, the EU funded molecular farming projects from 2004-2011 (www.pharma-planta.net) and gained regulatory approval for a recombinant protein product to enter phase 1 clinical trials in humans. The regulatory burden in Europe for biologic-produced GM plants such as GM crops is very costly and not appropriate for most plantmade pharmaceuticals (PMP) and plant-made industrial (PMI) applications(Sparrow et al. 2013). The authors propose that amendments to the EU Directive 2001/18/EC are necessary to fully acknowledge emerging technologies for production of PMP/PMI. Therefore, broader and more balanced legislative oversight is needed in Europe. Despite similar or even stricter conditions in Korea, there have been no experimental field trials using PMP/PMIproducing plants. Korea needs similar regulatory administration as Europe for biologic-produced plants.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Table 1.
