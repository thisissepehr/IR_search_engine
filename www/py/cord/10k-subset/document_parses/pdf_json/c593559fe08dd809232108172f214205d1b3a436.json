A group of Monascus orange pigment (MOP) amino acid derivatives, in which the reactive oxygen moiety was changed to amino acids, significantly inhibited HCV replication. Further, combination of the MOP derivatives (Phe, Val or Leu conjugates) with interferon (IFN)-a inhibited HCV replication more than IFN-a treatment alone. Lastly, molecular docking studies indicate the inhibitors may bind to a thumb subdomain allosteric site of NS5B. The antiviral activity of the MOP derivatives was related to a modulation of the mevalonate pathway, since the mevalonate-induced increase in HCV replication was suppressed by the MOP compounds.",

However, IFN-a alone or in combination with ribavirin often leads to a range of side effects, and the sustained virological response rate after combination therapy of pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin is ,50%, particularly for those infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4. 2 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative anti-HCV agents, especially for patients who do not respond to IFN-a therapy.",

            "text": "HCV is an enveloped RNA virus with a positive-sense single-strand RNA genome of 9.6 kb. The viral genome consists of one long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both the 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 ends of the genome. The ORF encodes a single polyprotein of 3010 amino acids that is proteolytically processed by cellular and viral proteases into \u226510 polypeptides corresponding to the viral structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. The 65 kDa HCV NS5B protein has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and is a key player in HCV RNA replication. 3 RdRp activity is not present in mammalian cells, offering the opportunity to identify selective inhibitors of the HCV RdRp. The crystal structure of HCV NS5B resembles a right hand shape with finger, thumb and palm domains similar to other polymerases. 4 Over the last decade, researchers have begun developing nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors, which target the active site in the palm subdomain and the allosteric sites in the thumb subdomain of NS5B. 5 Microbial secondary metabolites have a variety of biological properties that make them useful as antibiotics, anticancer drugs and antiviral drugs, and in other applications. 6 Monascusfermented products, first mentioned in a monograph of Chinese medicine in 1590, are produced by Monascus species, and historically have been used to treat indigestion, muscle bruises and dysentery. 7 Monacolin K, also known as lovastatin, is the major secondary metabolite produced by Monascus spp. and a potent inhibitor of 3 \u2032 -hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. 8, 9 Monascus pigments are also secondary metabolites synthesized from polyketides by Monascus spp. 10 There are six major Monascus pigments, including the yellow pigments monascin and ankaflavin, the orange pigments monascorubin (C 23 H 26 O 5 ) and rubropunctatin (C 21 H 22 O 5 ), and the red pigments monascropunctamine and rubropunctamine. 11 Monascus pigments have been used as food additives and traditional medicines in East Asian countries, including China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. 12 Further, the pigments have many useful biological activities, such as antimicrobial, 13 tumour suppressive and immunosuppressive activities, 14 as well as hypolipidaemic activities; 8 however, their mechanisms of action have not been well defined.",

            "text": "We tested the HCV inhibitory effect of the above-described MOP AADs in R-1 cells that harboured an HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon. This replicon consists of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which directs expression of a G418 selectable neo r marker, and an encephalomyocarditis virus IRES, which directs the expression of the HCV NS proteins (NS3 to NS5B) required for HCV replication (Figure 2a, top panel) . R-1 cells were treated with 10 mM of each MOP AAD for 48 h and then the remaining steady-state level of NS5B protein was determined by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 2 (a), among the selected group of MOP AADs that inhibited NS5B RdRp activity in vitro, Lys, Phe, Val, Leu and Ile derivatives also inhibited HCV replication in Huh7 cells, which harbour a HCV subgenomic replicon RNA. Treatment of cells with the positive control, IFN-a (100 IU/mL), or the MOP AAD both reduced the NS5B protein levels to different degrees. IFN-a reduced NS5B by 75% while the reductions for the AADs were: Lys 30%; Phe 39%; Val 38%; Leu 45%; and Ile 35%. In the conditions of this assay, none of the MOP compounds significantly affected Huh7 cell proliferation (at most ,10% at 10 mM concentration), as assessed by a colorimetric MTT assay (data not shown). Notably, in contrast to the in vitro RdRp assay results, the parental MOP compound did not significantly reduce HCV protein expression levels in the Huh R-1 cells, which might be due to its lower affinity to the RdRp or inability to pass through the plasma membrane. We next confirmed the anti-HCV activity of the five selected MOP derivatives (Lys, Phe, Val, Leu and Ile derivatives) by measuring HCV subgenomic RNA levels by real-time qRT -PCR. The HCV RNA levels were decreased by 38% -53% by treatment with 10 mM of each of the MOP derivatives (Figure 2b) . We finally selected MOP Phe, Val and Leu derivatives to further characterize the mechanism of HCV inhibition in HCV-infected cells. We used the HCV infection system established with the genotype 2a HCV clone JFH1, which yields infectious HCV virus from Huh7 or Huh7derived cell lines. 17 Because combination therapy with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin is the current standard therapy for the treatment of HCV infection, 26 we also sought to evaluate the potential of the MOP AADs to act in combination with IFN-a. HCV-infected Huh7 cells were treated with 10 mM of each MOP AAD alone or in combination with IFN-a (100 IU/mL) for 72 h and the HCV genome level was analysed by real-time qRT -PCR. As shown in Figure 3 RNA when combined with IFN-a and inhibited HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC 50 value of 8.9 mM (Figure 3b ). We also monitored viral NS5A and NS5B protein expression by western blot analysis. As shown in the Figure 3 (b) inset, the MOP-Leu derivative reduced NS5A and NS5B expression in a dose-dependent manner. Lastly, the compound displayed no significant cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 50 mM (,20% decrease of cell viability at 50 mM), as assessed by the MTT cell viability assay (Figure 3c ). Together, these results demonstrate that MOP AADs had antiviral activity against both genotype 2a HCV (from the Huh7 infection model) and genotype 1b HCV (from the subgenomic replicon system in Figure 2 ), and suggest their potential as novel HCV antiviral drugs when used in combination with IFN-a.",

As shown in Figure 4 hydrogen bond interaction site defined by amino acids Arg501 and Lys533. The propenyl moiety of MOP AADs is bound to the surface of one of the hydrophobic pockets defined by Trp528/ Leu497/Tyr477. The predicted binding mode of this moiety is similar to that of the ethylfuran moiety of the reference compound. The hexanoyl group of the MOP AADs, like the 4-fluorophenyl ring of the reference compound, is buried into a narrow deep hydrophobic pocket defined by Leu489, Ile482 and Met423. Lastly, two hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms of a carboxylate group on the inhibitors and Arg501 and Lys533 side chains on NS5B were also observed, as with the carboxylic acid moiety of the reference compound. The location of this inhibitorbinding site suggests that the binding of these inhibitors could interfere with a conformational change essential for HCV NS5B polymerase activity. 29 Interference with mevalonate pathway by the MOP AADs Lipid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis play a critical role in HCV replication. Because the HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, is the ratelimiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, various inhibitors of this enzyme were previously tested for anti-HCV activity. 30 In particular, lovastatin, one of the Monascus-produced secondary metabolites, was shown to effectively suppress HCV replication by inhibiting the interaction between HCV NS5A and the host protein FBL2. 31, 32 We also observed that lovastatin treatment (10 mM) for 48 h reduced viral genome abundance by 70% in HCV-replicating R-1 cells (data not shown), confirming previous reports. 30, 31, 33 Currently, it is not known whether MOP, like lovastatin, also interferes with cholesterol biosynthesis. To assess the possibility that MOP AADs may inhibit HCV replication by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, we first performed in vitro HMG-CoA reductase assays in HCV replication-supporting Huh7 cells. As shown in Figure 5 (b), MOP derivatives (the Phe, Val and Leu derivatives) did not have any observable HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity, even at a high concentration (10 mM), while pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, significantly decreased the enzyme activity at a concentration of 1 mM.",

This result prompted us to further investigate whether the MOP AADs block HCV replication by inhibiting the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway downstream of mevalonate. To test this possibility, we examined whether the increase in HCV replication by the addition of mevalonate can be suppressed by the MOP AADs. Huh7 R-1 cells, which harbour an HCV subgenomic replicon, were incubated with 10 mM mevalonate in the absence or presence of 10 mM of the Phe, Val or Leu MOP AADs. After 2 days, the cells were harvested and HCV subgenomic RNA levels analysed by real-time qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 5 (c), the HCV RNA level increased by 37% with the addition of mevalonate; however, the mevalonate-induced increase was completely blocked by MOP AAD treatment. Moreover, the increase in intracellular cholesterol caused by mevalonate supplementation was also inhibited by MOP AAD treatment and the cholesterol levels were reduced to the level of mock-treated cells (Figure 5d ). Together, these results suggest that in addition to a direct inhibition of NS5B RdRp activity, these MOP AAD compounds also inhibit HCV replication by interfering with the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway downstream of the HMG-CoA reductase step.",

The MOP AADs failed to dock to the other three NNI sites and did not show any common binding patterns shared with previously reported inhibitors known to bind to NNI-binding sites I, III and IV (data not shown). The pharmacophore of HCV NS5B NNI binding to thumb subdomain site II is composed of the hydrogen-bond interaction sites (Arg501 and Lys533) and a hydrophobic cavity, which appear to be occupied by a carboxylic acid residue and prophenyl residue of MOP AADs, respectively. Among those two predicted interacting parts of the MOP AADs, the carboxylic acid residue seems to be more critical for NS5B inhibition, since the MOP lacking this carboxylic acid residue showed comparably lower NS5B inhibitory activities and no detectable anti-HCV activity in HCV-replicating cells. Further, molecular docking simulations showed that the parental MOP compound did not make hydrogen bonds with Arg501 and Lys533. The NNIs binding to this site, like the inhibitors binding to the NNI-binding site I on the upper section of the HCV NS5B thumb domain, are likely to prevent the polymerase from adopting the closed conformation required for productive polymerization during elongation. 29 Genotype-dependent antiviral activity, which is due to the polymorphism of NS5B, is a major obstacle for the development of NNIs against HCV RdRp. Indeed, except for HCV796, an inhibitor that binds to NNI site IV on the palm domain, the activity of NNIs against non-genotype 1 HCV is limited. 36, 37 The MOP AADs selected in the present study demonstrated similar antiviral potency against HCV genotype 1b-derived subgenomic replicon cells and genotype 2a HCV-infected cells, suggesting the binding mode of these inhibitors was not limited to the genotype 1 NS5B polymerase. However, further studies are needed to determine whether these MOP derivatives provide a novel scaffold binding to the thumb subdomain allosteric sites of NS5B from other genotypes as well. In addition to genotype diversity, the emergence of resistant mutants is another obstacle for the development of NNIs. For instance, treatment of patients with NNI site II inhibitors, such as filibuvir and VCH759, in clinical trials resulted in the selection of resistant mutants with mutations at Leu419, Met423 and Ile482 of NS5B. 35, 38, 39 Our molecular docking simulation predicted that Leu489/Ile482/ Met423 is also involved in the binding of the selected MOP AADs to the site II hydrophobic pockets. Thus, it will be of interest to investigate whether the MOP AADs show cross-resistance with other NNI site II inhibitors. If so, MOP AADs would be additional combination choices for NNI cocktail therapy.",

In particular, cholesterol biosynthesis was proposed as an integral part of HCV RNA replication, which occurs on lipid rafts. 31, 40 In addition, HCV entry through the low-density lipoprotein receptor and viral assembly occurring on the surface of lipid droplets are also linked to cholesterol biosynthesis. 41, 42 Accordingly, various inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase have been shown to suppress HCV replication. 33, 43 Our results suggest that the anti-HCV activity of MOP AADs (the Phe, Val and Leu derivatives) might also be partially due to their ability to interfere with the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. The key enzyme in the mevalonate -cholesterol pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, was not inhibited by the MOP derivatives. However, the increased HCV RNA levels induced by mevalonate supplementation were inhibited by the MOP AADs. It was previously suggested that geranylgeranylation of the host factor FBL2 is required for targeting of HCV NS5A to the intracellular membranous structure to form the RNA replicase complex. 43 This previous study also demonstrated that the addition of cholesterol failed to rescue HCV RNA replication in the presence of lovastatin. 43 Thus, it is likely that the MOP AADs prevented HCV replication in part by blocking the generation of geranylgeranyl or its precursors, since the HCV NS5A -FBL2 interaction required for HCV replication depends on geranylgeranylation of FBL2. 43 Of note, the increased intracellular cholesterol level in the mevalonate-treated cells decreased upon treatment with the MOP AADs. Therefore, MOP AADs appear to be capable of inhibiting the step(s) involved in converting mevalonate to cholesterol or the enzyme converting farnesyl diphosphate to geranylgeranyl diphosphate.",

A double-hit strategy, including inhibition of HCV RdRp activity and interference with the mevalonate synthetic pathway, to inhibit HCV amplification may provide the basis for successful antiviral therapy using the MOP AADs derived from this microbial secondary metabolite. The selected AADs of MOP potentiated the antiviral activity of IFN-a, suggesting that combination therapy with IFN-a or other drugs may offer an alternative strategy for controlling HCV replication.",
