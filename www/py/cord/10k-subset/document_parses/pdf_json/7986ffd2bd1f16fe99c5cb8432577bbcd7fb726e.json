Using reovirus types 1 and 3, we infected 1B-6 cells (a cloned derivative of the Fisher rat cell line FRTL-5), and found a dose-dependent induction of thyroid cell MHC class II antigen expression as determined by laser flow cytometry and FITC-labelled OX-6 anti-RTl.B. As the number of viral particles/cell used for the infections increased from 5 to 100, the number of antigen positive cells increased, in reovirus type 3 infections to 50%, and in reovirus type 1 infections to 15%. Kinetic studies indicated that MHC class II antigen expression continues to increase three days after infection. Viral infection and the resulting MHC class II antigen expression may allow presentation of thyroid antigen to the immune system and participate in the initiation of autoimmune thyroid disease.",

MHC class II antigens allow the co-presentation of antigen to the helper T cells of the immune system. However, the specific factors which are likely to affect MHC class II antigens in autoimmune thyroid disease are uncertain. Animal models of endocrine dysfunction as a consequence of viral infection have been reported (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, the mechanism by which such viruses initiate endocrine autoimmunity remain obscure. Recent studies have indicated that the neurotropic murine hepatitis virus may induce expression of both MHC class I and class II antigen on murine astrocytes in tissue culture, rendering these cells competent to participate directly in the immune response to the viral infection (8, 9) .",

Using such gamma IFtreated cells as a control, 1B-6 cells were infected with reovirus type 3 for 1-2 hours. Forty-eight hours after a 2-hour infection of 1B-6 rat thyroid cells with reovirus type 3, we found a 20% induction of MHC class II antigen-bearing cells and a further 20% increase by 72 hours (Figure 1 ) . This MHC class II antigen induction exhibited a dosedependent relationship. Upon comparison of class II antigen responses to increasing doses of virus per cell, it was noted that as the number of plaque-forming units per cell (pfu/cell) increased (from 5 to 100), the percentage of antigen positive cells increased (from 5% to 47%) ( Figure 2D ). When reovirus type 1 was used, the percentage of MHC class II positive cells increased to 17% at 72 hours (Figure 2A ). Since MHC class II antigen expression allows endocrine cells to communicate with T helper cells of the immune system, it is possible that reovirus infection may initiate autoimmune endocrine disease by inducing endocrine cell MHC class II antigen expression in susceptible animal strains.",
