The current study was conducted to investigate the positive effects of dietary propolis (PR), as a potent naturally produced antioxidant, on growth performance and immune function of turkey poults exposed to oxidative stress induced by PQ injection. Native male turkey poults (n = 120, 49d-old) were randomly assigned into 4 groups: poults received a basal diet with a daily subcutaneous PQ injection of 5 mg/kg BW for 7 consecutive days (PQ group), an experimental diet containing 1 g/kg PR with a daily subcutaneous PQ injection for 7 days (PR+PQ group), or received the experimental PR diet with a daily subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL sterile saline for 7 days (PR group); while the control poults received a basal diet with a daily subcutaneous saline injection for 7 consecutive days (C group). The productive performance in the PQ group showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the weight gain (WG) and feed intake (FI), and impaired feed conversion ratio (FCR). Propolis supplementation in the PR+PQ group significantly ameliorated the PQ effects on WG and FCR. Turkey poults of the PQ and PR+PQ groups had a significant augmentation in the blood malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and corticosterone levels, and in contrast, a significant reduction in the triiodothyronine (T 3 ), when compared to the C group. While propolis significantly reduced the MDA and corticosterone, and increased the T 3 levels in the PR+PQ group compared to the PQ group. Furthermore, the dietary PR supplementation significantly limited the PQ-suppressive effects on cell-and humoral-mediated immunity and lymphocyte proliferation of turkey poults. In addition, propolis supplementation in the PR and PR+PQ groups markedly reversed the PQ-induced DNA fragmentation and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) over-expression in blood cells.

The potential mechanism of PQ toxicity is the cyclic single-electron redox reaction that depletes cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and generates superoxide anion. Superoxide ions may form hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals; the latter being an extremely potent oxidant that may damage nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides (Tukmechi et al., 2013) . Moreover, trace amounts of PQ can be detected in more than 100 crops such as corn, tomatoes, olives, field beans, and fruits (Prasad et al., 2009) . PQ effects in rodent models showed that prolonged exposure leads to accumulation and persistent damage in the brain, lung, and liver tissues (Ortiz et al., 2016) .

A similar low growth performance was obtained by feeding paraquat to fish (Babatunde and Oladimeji, 2014) or rats (Kimura et al., 1999) . The low performance after paraquat treatment is attributed to the oxidative stress that may have been due to active oxygen species formed by the action of paraquat. Previous reports attributed the low performance in oxidative stressed-broilers to the reduction in associated metabolic and endocrine responses (Lin et al., 2004) or the down-regulation of all sugar, peptide, and amino acid transporter genes in the small intestine (Ebrahimi et al., 2015) . On the other hand, dietary propolis ameliorated the suppression of weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion in turkey poults that were exposed to PQ injection. Furthermore, administration of propolis to the diets of the turkey poults without PQ stress enhanced the weight gain by 20% compared to the control poults. This enhancement may probably be due to the ability of propolis to improve nutrients digestibility and absorption as a result of improving saccharase, amylase, and phosphatase activities (Mutsaers et al., 2005) . Additionally, Shalmany and Shivazad (2006) reported that the increase in feed intake could be linked to the palatable substances in propolis like resin, wax, honey, and vanillin.

When propolis was supplemented to the diets of turkey poults, a reduction in MDA level was obtained in the PR+PQ group compared to the PQ group. Previous studies reported that the supplemental antioxidants extracted from propolis, such as flavonoids and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, block ROS production and protect cell membranes against oxidants (Seven et al., 2010) .

In addition to the increase in the TNF\u03b1 concentration in the PBMC's, PQ injection also induced a significant high plasma corticosterone concentration.

These results are consistent with the data presented by Riahi et al.

In a recent study, Mehaisen et al. (2017) reported that corticosterone treatment has immunosuppressive effect in broiler chickens. In addition, free radicals are known to attack unsaturated fatty acid side chains of phospholipids, causing a substantial decrease of the membrane integrity and fluidity of immune cells (Smith and Heath, 1974) .

Furthermore, the paraquat toxicity involves depletion of cellular reduction agent of NADPH which is used as a cofactor for lipid and nucleic acid synthesis (Kelner and Bagnell, 1989) .
