Methods. This study investigates whether a hand-held germicidal wand can efficaciously disinfect surfaces treated with either a vegetative or spore forming bacterium and to evaluate the effect of changing environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH), target position, and target distances on microbial kill rates. Results. Kill rate was best at 40-65% RH at a temperature range of 21-24\u00b0C. Both high and low RH interfered with the ability of UV-C to kill the vegetative microbe. In the case of the spore forming bacterium, increased surface drying time was the most significant factor increasing kill rate. Conclusions. This research demonstrates that UV-C was efficacious under optimal conditions, a direct beam exposure, and a short target distance (12.7 cm). However, there are limitations when used in nonoptimal conditions. Increased distance and indirect beam angles resulted in lower kill rates. It is also important to minimize unnecessary patient and worker exposure during its use.",

            "text": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant contributor to morbidity, mortality and cost in healthcare facilities. [1] [2] [3] [4] Klevens et al. estimated there were 1.7 million HAIs in 2002 and 98,987 deaths. Scott estimated the cost of HAIs to range from $28.4-$33.8 billion after adjusting to 2007 dollars. Research has demonstrated that the cost associated with drug resistant strains is $27,000-$127,000 higher than the cost of non-resistant strains. [5] Cost has been a particular concern for the healthcare industry because in 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began denying payments for HAIs. [6] The issue of HAI cost is complex and is influenced by many factors including the type of patient procedure and the type of infectious agent. A 2011 study by Umscheild et al. found the percentage of HAI that were preventable ranged from 45-69%. [7] This could result in up to 134,800 fewer infections, 3,100 fewer deaths, and a savings to the nation's healthcare system of $160-$630 million annually.",

            "text": "There has been increased interest in using stronger disinfectants or alternative disinfection strategies in the effort to combat HAIs. [8, 9] Some of these newer liquid disinfectants contain hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide mixtures, and superoxidized (electrolyzed) water. Two alternative strategies include room fumigation and ultraviolet C (UVC) surface disinfection. [10, 11] Stronger liquid disinfectants, chemical room fumigation, and UVC germicidal irradiation are being deployed in healthcare facilities because of concerns about the role of the environment as a cause of HAIs and a perception that current surface cleaning and disinfection methods are ineffective. It is important to remember that germicidal chemical disinfectants have the potential to not only inactivate microbes but to harm patients and workers. A significant concern is that not only the employee using the chemical germicide but patients who may be in the room during or shortly after cleaning have the potential to be exposed. These patients may be more susceptible to harm due to immunocompromising illnesses and may have continuous exposures while they are hospitalized. It is also important to remember that exposure to ultraviolet radiation can damage the skin, eyes, and immune system. [12] It is also well established that all forms of ultraviolet radiation, including UVC can cause skin cancer. [13, 14] On the positive side, UVC is the least likely of the UV bands to cause skin cancer because of relatively low penetration, permitting the radiation to be absorbed in the outer layer of dead skin cells. [15] Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other gram-positive bacteria have become an increasingly common problem in healthcare environments. [16] [17] [18] Another major concern has been the upswing in incidence of infections caused by Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). [19] This spore former organism is now considered to be the most important cause of diarrheal HAI. [20] Acinetobacter baumannii is yet another microorganism involved in HAIs that has been linked to environmental contamination. [21] [22] [23] While norovirus has been primarily a food borne disease, it is becoming a serious HAI problem in healthcare settings because it survives on surfaces and is highly infectious. [24] One of the latest microbes of concern are the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), especially involving Klebsiella pneumoniae. [25, 26] CRE is becoming more prevalent in U.S. hospitals because it is difficult to treat, and it also has a case fatality rate that may exceed 40%. [27] On the positive side, CRE organisms will be less resistant to environmental disinfection than other organisms such as spore formers.",

C. difficile has been assumed to be one of the most significant pathogens because of its environmental resistance and its high prevalence in hospitals. Stewart and Hollenbeak found that C. difficile's contribution to costs and mortality have been overestimated due to reporting bias. [28] They found that previous researchers had not controlled for differences in types of hospitals, differences in patient populations, and the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes when estimating the total costs of C. difficile to healthcare systems. This is an important consideration because concern over limiting the spread of C. difficile infections has been a major factor in the push to find alternative disinfection modalities.",

            "text": "Until recently, the common assumption has been that the number one risk factor for HAI is direct contact spread between a carrier and the patient or autoinfection of the patient due to colonizing organisms. [29, 30] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have only been a few reports documenting \"cause and effect\" between environmental contamination and infection. [31] In the last several years, there have been a number of studies that suggest a more important role of the environment in HAI. [18, 21, 30, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] There are a number of factors that contribute to the contamination of healthcare environments. Patients infected with MRSA and other communicable diseases will shed these microorganisms and may potentially serve as a source of HAIs. [33, 37, 39, [45] [46] [47] [48] Since C. difficile is a spore-former, it would be expected to be viable for months. [49] More importantly, the patient's environment has long been known as an important reservoir for C. difficile infections. [50] Even gowns and gloves worn to protect the healthcare worker have been found to be contaminated and to serve as potential vehicles of transmission. [51] A particular concern is that hospital textiles such as linens, surgical drapes, uniforms, patient apparel and many more may play a role in infection transmission. [52] There is evidence that the type of species or strain of microorganism affects survival in the environment. For example, A. baumannii strains survive desiccation better than other Acinetobacter sp. [45, 53] In the case of C. difficile, there is evidence that the Type 027/NAP1 strain has mutated and now has greater toxin production, pathogenicity, and infectivity. [19, 54] Akerlund et al. refer to this mutated organism as \"hypervirulent. \"",

The actual mechanism of transfer of the infectious agent to the patient is not well understood. A large scale observational study attempted to identify the kinds of contacts between patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors that present a risk of HAI. [55] The researchers found that in 21.6% of interactions between patient and healthcare provider or a visitor, there was no contact with either the patient or the environment. The most frequent interaction was contact with the patient's environment only (33.5%), followed by contact with intact patient skin (27.1%). The interaction with the highest potential for infection transfer was contact with the patient's blood or body fluids (17.8%). A particular concern was the proper use of gloves while touching blood or body fluids. The study revealed that healthcare providers complied over 94% of the time, whereas only 33% of visitors complied. This is an important consideration because failure to comply with hand hygiene and gloving policy by visitors may significantly increase the potential for infection transmission.",

Black lights have been used to identify the presence of rodent infestations and in hand hygiene demonstrations (Glo Germ). This same approach has been recently applied by environmental services to assess the quality of surface disinfection. [56] UVC has been used for upper air disinfection in the control of tuberculosis or other respiratory diseases for over 100 years. [15] The most effective design involves upper-room placement of the germicidal lamps that are shielded to reduce human exposure. Another effective approach is to place the UVC lamps in the exhaust system ductwork, or they may be used in the disinfection of ventilation system cooling coils. [57] [58] [59] To be most effective, the design of the dilution exhaust ventilation should bring the airborne pathogens into close proximity to the UVC germicidal lamps. Chang and Young found that in situations where the UVC radiance is high, the air turbulence is high, and the air velocities are low, germicidal effectiveness is reduced. [60] They emphasized the importance of conducting tracer turbulence studies before considering the use of germicidal UVC to assure that the airborne microorganisms come into close proximity to the lamps.",

[8, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] An important potential use of a handheld UVC germicidal wand would be the disinfection of frequently contacted surfaces. Some examples would include keyboard, patient bed rails, bedside tables, and even cell phones. Recently, there has been concern that mobile phones could serve as a reservoir for nosocomial infections. [66] Researchers found that 100% of healthcare workers' phones were contaminated with microbes due to poor disinfection and poor hand hygiene. A germicidal UVC wand could be an effective alternative to liquid disinfectants to disinfect these fomites. There are a number of challenges using this germicidal modality because, in general, microbes are easier to inactivate in the air than on surfaces. Unfortunately, current research has not considered some of the factors that limit UVC efficacy such as photoreactivation, relative humidity (RH), beam output stability, and beam angle in determining microbial kill rates. [67] [68] [69] [70] Our research explores the effects of RH, beam output, and beam angle on UVC efficacy to determine appropriate uses and limitations of this technology.",

Because relative humidity in the room is typically below 30%, a portable humidifier was employed to adjust humidity levels. In addition, a 61 \u00d7 61 cm square Plexiglas box was used for all tests, and an adjustable platform was used to vary the source to target distances; see Figure 1 . Germicidal UVC was administered using a Cole-Palmer ultraviolet lamp (model HV-09813-00). This unit operates at 254 nm and produces 2400 microwatts/cm 2 at 12.7 cm using a 40.6 cm long lamp. Intensity measurements were made for several exposure time intervals using a General UV512 C Digital UVC Light Meter designed to measure ultraviolet light in the range of 220-275 nm. A vegetative bacterial strain, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 12228 (Biosafety level 1) and a spore-former, Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) subsp. spizizenii ATCC 6633 (Biosafety level 1) were used as surrogates for MRSA and C. difficile. Each UV-C irradiation test was repeated in triplicate and involved the following steps. [8] A commercially lyophilized pellet (Microbiologic KWIK-STIK) of each microorganism was rehydrated and incubated overnight on a sheep blood agar plate at 37\u00b0C. Organisms were plated and incubated overnight twice to allow them to stabilize. Using sterile technique, suspensions of each organism were made in trypticase soy broth (TSB), in the range of 10 4 or 10 5 concentrations, using a densitometer designed for solution turbidity measurement of bacterial suspensions. Four vinyl coated laminate surfaces (7.5 cm \u00d7 10 cm in size) were streaked with ten microliters of either 10 4 or 10 5 concentrations of the microbe, spread in a 7.6 cm circle with a sterile bacterial spreader (Cole-Palmer). Microbioligistics KWIK-STICKs were used to inoculate each plate. Each KWIK-STICK unit contained a lyophilized pellet of a microorganism which was reconstituted, plated, and grown for 24 hr. A dilution was made in trypticase soy broth (TSB) with the growing organism. 10 \u00b5L of the dilution were inoculated onto the laminate surfaces, and spread in a 3-in circle. Each test surface was left to dry for either 10 or 30 min. The UVC lamp was allowed to warm-up prior to the start of each procedure. The UVC lamp took about three minutes to achieve peak intensity and then steadily lost up to 30% of that intensity over a period of about 30 min. After 30 min, the output was relatively stable and ready for use.",

Because the sensor was located approximately 1 cm below the surface of the photometer probe, this orientation resulted in an under estimate of scatter radiation intensity. During B. subtilis tests, the orientation of the photometer sensor was modified in positions 1 and 3 at a 12.7 cm target distance by placing the probe at a 90-degree angle facing the UVC lamp. This increased the measurement of scatter radiation by approximately 2 \u00bd times.

Our tests demonstrated that at a target distance of 12.7 cm, 10-sec exposure time resulted in the optimum kill rate (4.9-log reduction) in the center position. The improvement in kill rate by increasing the exposure duration from 5 to 10 sec was significant at a p-value of <0.001. Increasing the exposure to 30 sec did not increase kill rate.

Our results support that high RH interferes with the ability of UV systems to successfully kill pathogens. There has been little research on the effects of low RH (<30%) on the efficacy of UVC irradiation. [72] We found that low RH also interferes with UVC's ability to kill S. epidermidis. The effects of RH on B. subtilis kill rates were less pronounced, and the primary factor affecting kill rates was the drying time of the test surfaces. When only a 10-min surface drying time was used, this significantly increased the ability of B. subtilis to survive the effects of UV disinfection. The 30-min drying time of test surfaces resulted in a significantly higher kill rate and was determined to present a more realistic measure of actual use conditions. Results follow the inverse square law with the UVC lamp at 12.7 cm, 27.9 cm, and 50.0 cm away from test surface. At lower target distances (Figure 3 ), positions 1 and 3 only receive indirect beam exposure. At maximum distance of 50 cm, positions 1 and 3 receive direct beam exposure, providing a similar kill rate as position 2. The effects of distance on beam intensity and beam geometry are important considerations when using UVC as a surface germicidal agent. Placement of the UVC lamp at the minimum source to target distance will result in the highest intensity, but it will also treat the minimum surface area. Placement of the lamp at a longer target distance will increase the treatment area, but it may be necessary to increase the exposure time to maximize the kill rate. Our tests demonstrated that at a target distance of 12.7 cm, 10-sec exposure time resulted in the optimum kill rate (4.9-log reduction).",

            "text": "One limitation of using a handheld UVC lamp is that output is not stable. The 30-min warm-up time and 30% loss of intensity makes dose calculations challenging. Source to target distance and beam geometry were critical factors regarding radiation intensity and kill rates. Also, there is a tradeoff when considering the optimal source to target distance. A short target distance provides higher intensities and kill rates but treats a smaller surface area. Humidity had an effect on kill rates for S. epidermidis but not B. subtilis. For B. subtilis, surface dryness was a critical factor. Irradiating a damp surface treated with B. subtilis resulted in a significant reduction in kill rate. A limitation of this research was that we did not test photoreactivation. We cannot rule out that some of our results may have been affected by this phenomenon. A final concern is that exposure to UVC may result in ocular or dermal effects. Our results suggest that there is a potential for significant amounts of scatter radiation to the worker using the handheld UVC lamp. Therefore, it is essential that all individuals operating the device, take special care to avoid exposing themselves or exposing patients.
