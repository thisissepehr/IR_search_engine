Utilization of split liver grafts has been declining since a change of allocation rules for the second graft abolished incentives for German centres to perform ex situ splits. We therefore analysed our long-term experiences with the first ex situ split liver transplant series worldwide. Methods A total of 131 consecutive adult ex situ split liver transplants (01.12.1987-31.12.2010) were analysed retrospectively. Results Thirty-day mortality rates and 1-and 3-year patient survival rates were 13, 76.3, and 66.4 %, respectively. One-and three-year graft survival rates were 63.4 and 54.2 %, respectively. The observed 10-year survival Harald Schrem and Moritz Kleine have contributed equally to this paper.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "rate was 40.6 %. Continuous improvement of survival from era 1 to 3 was observed (each era: 8 years), indicating a learning curve over 24 years of experience. Patient and graft survival were not influenced by different combinations of transplanted segments or types of biliary reconstruction (p [ 0.05; Cox regression). Patients transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis had better survival (p = 0.021; log-rank), whereas all other indications including acute liver failure (13.6 %), acute and chronic graft failure (9.1 %) had no significant influence on survival (p [ 0.05; log-rank). Biliary complications (27.4 %) had no significant influence on patient or graft survival (p [ 0.05; log-rank). Hepatic artery thrombosis (13.2 %) had a significant influence on graft survival but not on patient survival (p = 0.002, [0.05, respectively; log-rank). Conclusions Split liver transplantation can be used safely and appears to be an underutilized resource that may benefit from liberal allocation of the second graft. The first description of a successful split liver transplantation using a left-lateral graft for a paediatric recipient and the remnant extended right graft for an adult recipient was reported by our institution in 1988 [1] . Before the introduction of split liver transplantation, reduced size liver transplantation had been used for paediatric liver transplantation, which resulted in the waste of liver segments 4-8 plus segment 1 [2] . Since 1988, with increasing experience and improvement of the surgical technique, the significant potential of split liver transplantation became apparent, and this modality soon became common practice [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, split liver transplantation from deceased donors still has a place in paediatric as well as adult liver transplantation [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . More advanced developments include the full anatomical liver split procedure for transplantation in two smaller adult liver recipients [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Today, the splitting procedure can be done either in situ during liver procurement in the deceased heart-beating donor or ex situ [7] [8] [9] . Both methods are considered to increase the risk for biliary complications [7] [8] [9] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Biliary complications belong to the most serious morbidities after all types of liver transplantation [18, 19] . Partial liver grafts have a higher incidence of biliary complications as a result of the risks of biliary leakage from the transected liver surface and as a result of the risks of surgical dissection in the hepatic hilum, which may cause injury to the intra-and extrahepatic bile ducts [3-17, 23, 24] . It could be demonstrated that the in situ split of the liver graft in the deceased donor is associated with significantly shorter cold ischemic times compared with the ex situ split procedure [6] [7] [8] [9] . Unfortunately, the in situ split approach often is restrained by logistical and technical efforts and lack of expertise as well as financial expenditures, all of which are necessary for its ultimate success [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In practice, about half of all split liver transplantation procedures in Europe and the United States are done after ex situ split of the liver graft [7] [8] [9] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Split liver transplantation is still discussed controversially for high-urgency and retransplant cases and some transplant centres still hesitate to use split liver grafts in adults [7] [8] [9] 17] . Our goal is to evaluate the long-term results of ex situ split liver transplantation and the influences of complications and their management.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 615, "end": 623, "text": "(27.4 %)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1245, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1459, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1667, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1671, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1675, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1679, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1683, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1684, "end": 1687, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1691, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1828, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1832, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1836, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1840, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1845, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1850, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1865, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2003, "end": 2007, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2008, "end": 2012, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2017, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2022, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2023, "end": 2027, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2160, "end": 2163, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2164, "end": 2167, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2171, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2249, "end": 2252, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2256, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2260, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2265, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2270, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2275, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2276, "end": 2280, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2285, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2286, "end": 2290, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2295, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2300, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2305, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2414, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2415, "end": 2418, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2721, "text": "[3-17, 23, 24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2916, "end": 2919, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2920, "end": 2923, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2924, "end": 2927, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2931, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3141, "end": 3144, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3145, "end": 3148, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3152, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3153, "end": 3156, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3157, "end": 3160, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3161, "end": 3164, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3165, "end": 3169, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3170, "end": 3174, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3327, "end": 3330, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3331, "end": 3334, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3335, "end": 3338, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3339, "end": 3343, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3344, "end": 3348, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3349, "end": 3353, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3354, "end": 3358, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3543, "end": 3546, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3547, "end": 3550, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3551, "end": 3554, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3555, "end": 3558, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This is a retrospective, single-centre analysis with ongoing data collection from a university hospital within the ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Patients and methods"}, {"text": "The combinations of transplanted segments, the types of biliary reconstructions and T-drain usage in this series are summarized in Table 2 .

We therefore consider that the long-term results of the first series of adult ex situ split liver transplantation since 1987 will be of interest in times of continued donor organ shortage and resulting deaths on the waiting lists. Thirty-day mortality in this series appears comparatively high and the overall 1-and 3-year patient survival rates appear comparatively low compared with today's expectations. As could be demonstrated in Fig. 1 , these results were influenced by the era during which the transplants have been performed. In this context, it is very interesting to note that patient survival has improved continuously from era to era. It can be assumed that the development of our series reflects a learning curve since the introduction of split liver transplantation in 1987. The comparatively high retransplant rate (22.9 %) is a result of the very long observational period. Mean graft survival of split liver transplants that were followed by a retransplant procedure during follow-up was 533 (range 1-2,655) days. A significant improvement of graft survival from era 1 to 3 was observed (p = 0.041, log-rank).

In our experience T tubes can be omitted and are omitted in our current practice of split and full size liver transplantation even though the data presented in our paper does not seem to provide clear evidence that this is the right choice. There is no conclusive evidence available for the influence of different types of biliary tract reconstruction on biliary complications after split liver transplantation or on graft or patient survival due to a complete lack of randomized, controlled trials [15, [17] [18] [19] 44] . Interestingly, a recent study including all types of liver transplantation could demonstrate that hepaticojejunostomy was an independent risk factor for the development of hepatic artery thrombosis [45] . We also found a significant influence of hepaticojejunostomy on the development of hepatic artery thrombosis in this series. In our practice, Roux-en-Y biliary reconstruction is limited to cases transplanted for PSC and to cases with destructed central bile ducts (e.g., in retransplant cases) as is the case in full size liver transplantation. The current series contains many patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis because our hepatologists have a research focus and a special clinical interest in this disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1017, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1036, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1241, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 384, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Units of intraoperatively transfused"}, {"text": "We believe that it is a progress in surgical technique to abandon the veno/venous bypass.

Hepatic artery thrombosis had a significant influence on graft survival but not on patient survival. It is interesting to note that the overall incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis after transplantation (n = 17; 13.2 %) was slightly more frequent compared with the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 4; 11.8 %) in cases with biliary complications which may be a consequence of early retransplantation after hepatic artery thrombosis before biliary complications could manifest in some cases.
