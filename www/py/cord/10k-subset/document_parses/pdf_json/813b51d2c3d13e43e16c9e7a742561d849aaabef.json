The partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is therefore below the predicted normal range for ~he patient's age at the prevalent barometric pressure of the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (paCO2) is elevated above the normal range. It has been accepted that in respiratory failure the paO 2 is below 60 mm of Hg and paCO 2 is above 50 mm of Mg. 1 In many instances respiratory failure is the consequence of underlying chronic pulmonary disease which gets exacerbated by acute pulmonary insults or reaches an end stage due to progressive disease. Another variety is where acute respiratory failure occurs in persons with previously normal lungs due to some precipitous insult. The onset in acute respiratory failure is relatively sudden.",
