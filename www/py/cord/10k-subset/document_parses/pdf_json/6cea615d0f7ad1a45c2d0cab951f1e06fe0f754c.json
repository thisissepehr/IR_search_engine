            "text": "A B S T R A C T Challenges arising from epidemic infectious disease outbreaks can be more effectively met if traditional public health is enhanced by sociology. The focus is normally on biomedical aspects, the surveillance and sentinel systems for infectious diseases, and what needs to be done to bring outbreaks under control quickly. Social factors associated with infectious disease outbreaks are often neglected and the aftermath is ignored. These factors can affect outbreak severity, its rate and extent of spread, influencing the welfare of victims, their families, and their communities. We propose an agenda for research to meet the challenges of infectious disease outbreaks. What social factors led to the outbreak? What social factors affected its severity and rate and extent of spread? How did individuals, social groups, and the state react to it? What are the short-and long-term effects on individuals, social groups, and the larger society? What programs can be put in place to help victims, their families, and affected communities to cope with the consequences -impaired mental and physical health, economic losses, and disrupted communities? Although current research on infectious disease outbreaks pays attention to social factors related to causation, severity, rate and extent of spread, those dealing with the ''social chaos'' arising from outbreaks are usually neglected. Inclusion, by combining traditional public health with sociological analysis, will enrich public health theory and understanding of infectious disease outbreaks. Our approach will help develop better programs to combat outbreaks and equally important, to help survivors, their families, and their communities cope better with the aftermath.",

For example, one might attempt to determine what social conditions tend to facilitate the appearance of disease outbreaks; how a particular society reacts to disease outbreaks and why; and whether there are differential impacts on different ethnic groups, social classes, males and females, age groups, and geographical regions. One might also study short-and long-term impacts on individuals, their family members, and the larger community. In the case of the larger community, distinguished sociologist Kai Erickson's (1) approach -his classic study of the destruction of community as a result of natural disaster in the form of a severe flood in the book ''Everything in Its Path'' -can be used for a richer understanding of the impact of such events. All elements should be incorporated and combined to develop more effective programs to combat disease outbreaks and to help survivors, their families, and their communities to cope better with the aftermath.",

Sociological analysis would help determine what social conditions -the rough equivalent of the ''environment'' in the agent-host-environment relationship used in the traditional public health -facilitate the appearance and spread of emerging diseases such as Nipah virus and SARS and re-emerging diseases such as TB. Sociological analysis would help us learn how the larger society, as well as groups and individuals, react to the appearance and spread of the disease. One might analyze the social effects, both short term and long term, on different societal groups. Traditional public health approaches fail with respect to these last two aspects and would be strengthened through the inclusion of sociological analysis.",

Economic crises result in high rates of inflation, unemployment, widespread poverty, and so on. During such times, malnutrition increases, lowering resistance to disease. After the collapse of Communist regimes in Russia and other parts of the Soviet Union, for example, diseases like diphtheria and TB increased considerably (2, 3) . Social chaos following natural disasters or war can bring on outbreaks of epidemic disease. Gastro-intestinal diseases proliferate after floods, when water supplies are contaminated or after earthquakes that destroy the piped water, sanitation, and solid waste collection systems. Refugee movements during times of war spread disease to other demographic groups and geographical regions.",

The appearance and spread of certain new human diseases may simply be the outcome of naturally occurring mutations. In the case of other new diseases, there is evidence that they are zo\u00f6 notic in origin and have jumped the species barrier from animals to human beings. One reason is the increasing intrusion of human beings into the habitats of wild animals, whether because of economic activities such as forestry, oil exploration, and mineral extraction or the opening of farms and plantations in wilderness areas, or leisure activities such as ecotourism. Thus, the Ebola virus may have spread from animal reservoirs into humans because of the movement of human beings into wilderness areas (4) . With the increasing popularity of new phenomena such as ecotourism, which is facilitated by relatively cheap and fast travel by jet aircraft, it would be relatively easy for exotic new diseases to spread from the wilderness to populated areas. Other phenomena such as the international pet industry (including exotic pets) can also help to spread zo\u00f6 notic diseases (5) .",

Examples would include antibiotic abuse in the livestock industry where healthy animals are fed antibiotics regularly in order to prevent disease, thus resulting in the quicker appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (so-called ''Mad Cow disease'') caused by the feeding of live cows with the processed brain tissue and other parts of dead but infected cows.",

In South Africa, HIV-positive men have raped baby girls because of the belief that sex with young virgins would result in the cure of HIV/AIDS (11) -an extreme example of seeking of ''miracle cures'' for highly virulent diseases. In the USA, certain religious groups believe that HIV/AIDS is divine punishment for homosexuality. In Malaysia, the reaction of certain fundamentalist religious groups to the challenge of HIV/AIDS has not been any more enlightened. Elsewhere, HIV/AIDS is regarded as a disease that afflicts only foreigners and outcast social groups such as drug abusers and prostitutes, and that mainstream groups are immune to it.",

In investigating and controlling the outbreak, one of the first challenges was to identify the disease-causing agent. The Nipah virus was identified and believed to have spread from fruit bats to domesticated pigs and then to humans who worked in the pig-rearing industry in Perak and Negri Sembilan states in Malaysia (18) . Scientists undertook transmission experiments with pigs to determine how they passed the virus to other pigs, and then on to humans. Hundreds of thousands of pigs from affected areas were culled in a program of eradication. During the first phase of culling, 901,228 pigs from 896 farms were eliminated in the infected areas. Another 172,750 pigs from 50 farms that tested positive for Nipah virus were culled in a second phase. The epidemic was brought under control by May 1999. Poon and Khaw note that there were 105 deaths among 265 human cases of the disease. As a result of the outbreak and the resultant culling operation, the pig population in Malaysia was reduced from 2.4 million to 1.32 million. The number of pig farms dropped from 1885 to 829 (19) .",

What is the situation of other pig farmers and their families in the aftermath of the Nipah virus epidemic? Was the financial support given to them by the Malaysian Government and members of the public sufficient to help them to recover from the epidemic? It appears not. The flourishing pig-rearing industry in Negri Sembilan state in Malaysia has been largely wiped out. An entire community, the town of Bukit Pelanduk, has been hurt by the destruction of its economic base through the mass culling of pigs. These significant questions have not been answered because public health experts have not followed up. They have not studied how the mental health and social lives of the people have been impacted in the long term. Sociological analysis using Kai Erickson's ''destruction of community'' approach would help increase considerably our understanding of the short-and long-term impact of such disease outbreaks. A well-designed, sociologically nuanced study of the impact of the Nipah virus outbreak could possibly investigate the following:",

Whether the Nipah virus outbreak resulted in short-and long-term socioeconomic effects on survivors, their families, and the community. This might be measured by reduced household income, higher unemployment and underemployment, significant financial loss, higher rates of indebtedness, discord among family members, and out-migration or population decline. The state of residents in neighboring communities not struck by the Nipah virus compared to remaining residents of Bukit Pelanduk. Mental health -broadly defined to include measures like substance abuse and domestic violence -and socioeconomic status can also be considered. Whether community bonds in Bukit Pelanduk were strong enough prior to the Nipah virus outbreak to enable the community to rebuild itself, recover, and perhaps even to flourish. Some communities are quicker to ''rebound'' from disaster depending on how widespread or severe the devastation was and on how strong community bonds were prior to the event. In conclusion, we propose to combine the traditional public health approach with sociological analysis to enrich public health theory, to develop better programs to combat disease outbreaks, and to help survivors and their families, and communities to better cope with the aftermath. Our opinion is that the traditional public health approach (which focuses on the disease and its victims alone while paying some attention to the ''environment'') is rather inadequate. Typically, after an epidemic disease outbreak has been brought under control, little further attention is paid to its victims, their families, and their affected communities. We feel that the traditional public health approach should be combined with broader sociological analysis in order to develop a better and deeper understanding of what social factors affect the occurrence of epidemic disease outbreaks and other sudden health-threatening events such as bioterrorism, and what affects outbreak severity, rate, and extent of spread. The remaining items on our agenda for research (i.e., those dealing with the ''social chaos'' arising from outbreaks) should not be neglected by those who study infectious disease outbreaks. Their inclusion through a combination of the traditional public health approach and sociological analysis would enrich both public health and sociological theory. We would see practical dividends -better programs to combat disease outbreaks and to help survivors, their families, and their communities to cope with the aftermath. Research can help us understand how ''social learning'' gained from the earlier Nipah virus epidemic was used effectively to contain later disease threats such as SARS and avian influenza in Malaysia. The Nipah virus disaster taught us that government must monitor farm animal populations for unusual patterns of sickness and death, quickly quarantine or cull affected animals, and strictly enforce rules to prevent smuggling of animals from affected areas. All these lessons were used to good effect to control the later outbreak of avian influenza in Kelantan state in Malaysia.",
