A sharp decrease in egg production and increased mortality without apparent clinical signs was reported. Each house contained approximately 12,000 females and 1,000 males. All birds had been vaccinated with commercial IB vaccine virus strains (Massachusetts and Connecticut types) 3 times during the growing period. The older birds (53 weeks) in House A, showed a more drastic decline in production, 20% in two days, than either House B (40 weeks old), or House C (42 weeks old) which dropped five to ten percent in production in a week. Egg shell quality problems occurred two weeks after the initial production drop. The birds did not achieve normal production after this period of illness. Upon necropsy, approximately 1 week after the production drop, affected birds exhibited a catarrhal tracheitis, airsacculitis, and inactive ovaries. Virus isolation attempts from these birds were unyielding since the tracheal swab material was heavily contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, swabs were then taken from several birds showing no respiratory signs and pooled for virus recovery attempts. Upon initial passage in embryos, only one of ten embryos showed stunting and dwarfing. CA fluid harvested from this embryo was then passed a second time in embryos, after a ten-fold dilution, and within 48 hours, a substantial number of embryos died. Table 1 shows the log 10 neutralization indices (NI's) of various pooled antiserums representing known IBV serotypes and the Indiana virus. Indiana antiserum did not significantly neutralize any of the heterologous viruses (NI < 2.00) but did have an NI = 5.38 log ]0 EID 50 with the homologous virus. Heterologous antiserums failed to significantly neutralize the Indiana virus but had high homologous titers.
