            "text": "have been classified, of which the strains containing subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H2N2 have been reported to circulate amongst the human population [2, 6, 7] . NA is important for the budding of new virus particles, whereas the homotrimeric HA protein plays a crucial role in entry into the host cell, being responsible for both attachment and catalysis of membrane fusion, a process that is thermodynamically favorable but has appreciable kinetic barriers [8] . Antigenic shift and antigenic drift are the major causes of yearly influenza epidemics and is therefore studied intensively [9] . HA is proteolytically cleaved from the inactive precursor HA0 into the disulfide-linked subdomains HA1 and HA2 by host cell enzymes [2, 6, 10, 11] . HA1 forms a globular, receptor-binding domain binding to \u03b1-sialic-acid linkages present on the host cell membrane [9] . In general, these sialic-acids are a part of a sugar chain on a glycosylated protein or lipid in the host cell membrane. In the prefusion state, HA1 envelopes HA2 and thereby may sterically restrict HA2 rearrangements [9] . The low-pH environment in the late endosome triggers a conformational change in HA. Upon lowering of the pH, HA1 dissociates and HA2 unfolds [12] . Due to the extended intermediate, the fusion peptide can insert into the target membrane. HA then zippers up onto itself which brings the membranes together. The zippering of the HA then forces the membranes to fuse and that leads to the formation of a hemifusion stalk where only the proximal leaflets of both membranes have merged. The stalk can proceed to a fusion pore, or form an elongated hemifusion diaphragm that may then lead to a pore [6, 13] .",

In this study we investigate the effect of both the sialic-acid donor and the lipid-to-cholesterol ratio of the target membrane on the efficiency and kinetics of influenza fusion using a single-particle in vitro assay. The effect of cholesterol on influenza fusion has been studied before using bulk liposomal fusion studies, but the effects at the single-particle level have not yet been elucidated [15, 17] . Furthermore, there have not yet been systematic studies into the effect of the sialic-acid donors. Here we show that both cholesterol percentage and sialic-acid donors have a significant impact on the efficiency as well as the kinetics of influenza hemifusion.",

Single influenza virus particles were immobilized on a supported planar lipid bilayer using either GYPA or GD1a as sialic-acid receptor and were fluorescently labeled in the membrane with a lipophilic dye, R18 ( figure 1(A) ). The target bilayers contained 0, 10, 20, or 40 percent mol mol \u22121 cholesterol and imaging was performed using TIRF microscopy ( figure 1(B) ). The fluidity of the bilayer was confirmed using FRAP in a separate experiment (SI figure 1 (stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/30/204005/ mmedia)). The experiment starts with flowing in the virus particles which dock onto the sialic-acid donors. As the pH is still too high (pH ~7.4), no fusion can occur. Only after flowing in citric acid buffer (pH 5.0), the pH is lowered and hemifusion can start to occur. The pH drop, after flowing in the citric acid buffer, is monitored by labeling the target membrane with fluorescein. When the pH is lowered, the pH-sensitive fluorescence of fluorescein drops, indicating the time of the hemifusion trigger (t 0 ). Hemifusion itself is visualized by the diffusion of the R18 membrane label from the virus into the target membrane. R18 can start to diffuse after the fusion of the proximal leaflets. As R18 is a self-quenching dye this diffusion is characterized by an initial spike in fluorescence followed by a gradual decrease in the region of interest. The onset of this 'spike' is defined as the hemifusion time (t hemifusion ) (figure 1(C)).",

In all conditions hemifusion efficiency was affected by the cholesterol percentage of the target bilayers. All conditions show an upward trend in hemifusion efficiency as the percentage of cholesterol in the target bilayer increased ( figure 2(A) ). This upward trend is best illustrated by the results of the X-31 GD1a condition where all of the tested cholesterol conditions showed a significant change in efficiency (SI table 1 ). This change in efficiency, however, seems to be less pronounced in the conditions which use GYPA as a sialic-acid donor. For both X-31 and PR8 the 0% and 10% cholesterol conditions do not show a significant difference. Also of note, the hemifusion efficiency of the GD1a condition is significantly higher overall than in the GYPA conditions. The higher efficiency of GD1a suggests that the sialic-acid donor also has an impact on the hemifusion efficiency. It also shows that the sialic-acid donor has an effect on the cholesterol dependency of hemifusion efficiency. As a control, experiments were performed with Influenza X-31 and lowered concentrations of GD1a. Trials were performed with 50\u00d7 less and 400\u00d7 less GD1a in target bilayers with a 40% cholesterol content. 40% was chosen as this was the condition closest to natural endosomes [18, 19] . The rationale behind using conditions with 50\u00d7 less and 400\u00d7 less GD1a is that these concentrations result in the target bilayer having the same concentration of sialic-acid or sialic-acid donors respectively as the GYPA condition. As GD1a is used in a 400\u00d7 times higher concentration and GYPA has 8\u00d7 as many sialic-acids as GD1a (GYPA has 16, GD1a has 2) [20, 21] . Both 50\u00d7 less and 400\u00d7 less showed hemifusion efficiency comparable to the GYPA condition (SI figure 2) .",

As they postulate, it is very likely that the effect of cholesterol on the intrinsic curvature of the membrane plays a role, as fusion proceeds via strongly curved intermediate states [22] . Cholesterol would aid the fusion process as its negative curvature would lower the energy necessary to form the intermediate state [23, 24] . While it is very likely that the negative curvature of cholesterol plays a large role in the increase of hemifusion efficiency it is also likely it is not the only effect of cholesterol. In this study we could see that the cholesterol dependency of hemifusion efficiency was modulated by the sialic-acid donors, with the GYPA conditions showing a significantly lower response to changes in the composition of the target membrane compared to the GD1a condition especially at low cholesterol contents. One explanation for this sialic-acid dependency is that cholesterol may interact with the sialic-acid donors, possibly forming lipid rafts in one or both of the conditions [25] [26] [27] . This recruitment may form a high cholesterol area which is either enriched or depleted of sialic-acids which, in turn, could increase or decrease the probability of the influenza viral particle docking on to the membrane. For instance, the lower cholesterol dependency on hemifusion efficiency of the GYPA condition could mean that GYPA recruits cholesterol in lipid rafts and thus reduces the relative difference of cholesterol content in specific sialic-acid rich areas between the trials with differing overall cholesterol contents.",

Studies into the fusion of influenza vary in the use of sialic-acid donors [6, 14, 17, 28 ]. Yet we find a remarkable effect on both hemifusion efficiency and time when comparing the GYPA and GD1a conditions. Possibly the increased efficiency in hemifusion in the GD1a condition was based on the difference in sialic-acid concentration. When forming our bilayers GYPA and GD1a were added in concentrations following the protocols of Otterstrom et al and Floyd et al, respectively [6, 28] . However, these studies do not use equivalent concentrations of sialic-acid with Floyd using 50\u00d7 more sialic-acid in the bilayer. We tested the different sialic-acid concentrations in the 40% cholesterol condition. The low GD1a conditions showed hemifusion efficiency that reached similar levels as in the GYPA condition (SI figure 2 ). This effect of low GD1a concentration would mean that sialicacid concentration is an important parameter in hemifusion efficiency. However, it is also likely that the type of donor plays a role as well. For example, one GYPA glycoprotein has on average 16 sialic-acids while one GD1a molecule merely contains two [20, 21] . This difference in sialic-acids per molecule could mean that effectively the sialic-acid concentration of GYPA could be higher due to a higher local concentration which could have an impact on HA binding.",

Our GYPA data does not show any correlation between hemifusion efficiency and hemifusion time. Therefore, it is likely that there is a factor which does affect hemifusion efficiency but not the hemifusion time and that this factor is a property of the target bilayer, a factor which still seems to be missing from the current models. A proposition made more likely when looking at the low GD1a results as once again the hemifusion efficiency and the time do not seem to be correlated. In the case of the comparable concentrations of sialic-acid (50\u00d7 less) we notice a marked drop in hemifusion efficiency, yet the hemifusion time is actually higher than in the regular concentration (SI figure 5) . The hemifusion time with the 400\u00d7 less GD1a condition is increased yet in this condition particle docking within field of view was an order of magnitude lower than other conditions. As such, the significance of this result is debatable. The data was fitted with the commonly used gamma distribution fit in order to illustrate the changes in hemifusion time [6] . Fit parameters in SI table 4. It is possible that an all-or-nothing effect may be at play here. The observed results could be explained by GYPA recruiting cholesterol into cholesterol and sialic-acid enriched areas which greatly increase the probability of HA2 insertion into the target membrane. These enriched areas would make for very hemifusion efficient 'hotspots'. These hotspots would explain the lack of cholesterol dependence in GYPA hemifusion rates. If hotspots have similar local concentrations of cholesterol across the conditions it would remove cholesterol as a factor when studying hemifusion time. It would also explain why hemifusion efficiency would still be cholesterol dependent as opposed to the time. As the overall cholesterol content of the bilayer increased the surface area covered by these hotspots would as well. The increased hotspot surface area, in turn, would increase the probability of virions docking on or near these hotspots. As the vast majority of hemifusion events would be on or near these hotspots this would increase hemifusion efficiency overall.",

Labeled viral particles are docked and the target bilayer is labeled with a pH sensor. The membrane dye (R18) is indicated as red, the pH sensor (fluorescein) is indicated as green. As pH drops fluorescein quenches and upon hemifusion the membrane dye diffuses across the planar bilayer. (B) A schematic representation of the microscope setup. Experiments were performed in separate channels of the microfluidic flow cell. Emitted fluorescence is split using a dichroic mirror and imaged on different halves of an EM-CCD camera. (C) Field of view and resulting graphs. (Top left) microscope image 5 s before pH trigger. Green channel shows fluorescein, red channel shows the viral particles. (Top right) microscope image 240 s after pH drop. Fluorescein signal has lowered and particles have undergone hemifusion. (Bottom) the resulting graph after analysis. The drop in fluorescence in the green channel is designated t 0 . A spike in fluorescence in the red channel indicates the t hemifusion of the particle.",
