In a rather conceptual way one can subdivide the human environment into a number of fields which are by no means truly separated from each other. Commonly these are categorized into a geoclimatic and a sociocultural compartment, but even between these two compartments considerable overlaps exist. For example, a natural feature easily changes to a sociocultural one by exploitation and specific use by man. Substantial variables within the individual fields can operate by quite different mechanisms, including toxic-metabolic and/or immunological paths, but they might also be vectors of infectious agents. Thus a strict fixation on one or another of these two basic mechanisms of causation cannot be made by epidemiology, as long as no clear knowledge is available from clinical or experimental research. In addition it should be kept in mind that epidemiology is almost exclusively able to generate and to support hypotheses; final confirmation has to be left to the basic disciplines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Criteria for causal inference in epidemiological research have recently been reformulated by M.

There are, however, well known shortcomings: the individual risk is not tested, and many confounders are in play.

There are surprisingly few investigations giving only sparse data so far. Thus Barlow, in 1960, performed an extensive correlation analysis between the MS mortality rate and cosmic ray intensity for which geomagnetic latitude was used as a proxy measure (26). He found such a correlation worldwide and within individual countries such as the USA, Australia, and Italy. Resch (27) recently revived this view, and confirmed Barlow's findings on the basis of more recent prevalence data on the global level. In addition he emphasized the parallels of MS and geomagnetic latitude in the most northern parts of Europe. Apart from sun radiation (vide infra) natural types of radiation were not studied further. For example an interesting question might be a role of terrestric radiation due to radon decay which is high in mountainous areas (28).

Statistical adjustment for latitude removed, however, most of these associations, with the exception of a product term of rainfall and low temperature. The problem of such an adjustment will be treated below. In a greater number of further regions positive associations with MS were reported for low temperature (8, 14, 17, 18, (31) (32) (33) (34) . As far as humidity/ precipitation is concerned, our own investigations by the correlational approach in the USA (33), France and Australia point in particular to the winter conditions as more important in that respect. For example in the USA, beside the consistent correlation with low temperature, a positive one with snowfall but not with annual rainfall was found. The same was true for winter, but not for annual and summer humidity in Australia (Table 1 ). In France the MS mortality (35) showed a very similar northeast-to-southwest gradient as both January temperature and January humidity (36) ( Table 1 ). In the Australia and New-Zealand region MS prevalence data from the 1980's (37) showed a highly significant correlation with latitude but, using climatic tables (38) , also with low annual temperature (r,=0.883; p<O.Ol), low sushine (r,=0.767; p<0.05) and higher winter humidity (r,=0.929; p<0.02), whereas non-aridity and the number of fog days were not significantly related.

In this comprehensive analysis they demonstrated, in comparison with control communities and North American standards, especially high soil concentrations of chromium and some other elements, and low concentrations of aluminium, borium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenium and others. Also in the drinking water a number of deviations were found, e.g. a high molybdenium content, in contrast to the soil. The lead concentration was fairly high in the soil, but low in the water.

So far no clear association with a higher SES was demonstrated, but the direction of results is clearly biased in favour of a higher SES (70, 71) . However, detection bias must be seriously considered.

Both coniferous wood smoke and peat smoke have a higher likelihood of generating such compounds due to their lower methoxy-group content (66, 117) (allowing nitro-group addition) and the additional formation of nitrosated polyaromatic hydrocarbons (1 18). Such nitrophenolic compounds are of particular interest in the context of autoimmunity, because they are prominent target antigens and thus possible stimulators of the natural immune system, perturbations of which are now considered of importance in the generation of autoimmune disorders (review in ref. 47 ). Most interestingly, both molecular mimicry between nitrophenols and MBP on the level of natural antibodies (1 19) , and the intrathecal synthesis of such cross-reacting natural antibodies in MS patients (120) have been demonstrated. The amphipathic character of the hapten with its predominating aromatic ring structure appears of paramount interest as a basis of cross-reactivity with respect to a strongly hydrophobic epitope around amino acid 90 in MBP Several studies suggested a more specific immune response in HLA-DR2 positive MS patients towards this particular epitope (121) (122) (123) . As a possible alternative, drugs cross-reacting with nitrophenols Agriculture Several hypotheses on the role of agricultural features were formulated.
