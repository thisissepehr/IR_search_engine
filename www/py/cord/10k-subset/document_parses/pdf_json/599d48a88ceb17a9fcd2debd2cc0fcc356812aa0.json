AT III irreversibly inhibits serine proteases (e.g. activated factor X and thrombin) in a one-to-one ratio, with the generation of protease-AT III complexes. Heparin prevents AT III from interacting with the endothelial cell surface by binding to sites on the AT III molecule, competing for the AT III binding site, and reducing AT III's ability to interact with its cellular receptor. AT III's anticoagulant effect is thus greatly accelerated (by a factor of 1000) by heparin; heparin reduces AT III's anti-inflammatory properties, weakens vascular protection and increases bleeding events [7] [8] [9] Heparin in patients with sepsis, septic shock or DIC associated with infection may be associated with decreased mortality [10] .
