            "text": "One of the most important components of a virus is the protein shell or capsid that encloses its genetic material. The main role of the capsid is to protect the viral genome against external aggressions, facilitating its safe and efficient encapsulation and delivery. As a consequence, viral capsids have developed astonishing mechanical properties that are crucial for viral function. These remarkable properties have started to be unveiled in singlevirus nanoindentation experiments, and are opening the door to the use of viral-derived artificial nanocages for promising bio-and nano-technological applications. However, the interpretation of nanoindentation experiments is often difficult, requiring the support of theoretical and simulation analysis. Here we present a 'Virtual AFM' (VAFM), a Brownian Dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of virus aimed to mimic the standard setup of atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments. Despite the heavy level of coarse-graining, these simulations provide valuable information which is not accessible in experiments. Rather than focusing on a specific virus, the VAFM will be used to analyze how the mechanical response and breaking of viruses depend on different parameters controlling the effective interactions between capsid's structural units. In particular, we will discuss the influence of adsorption, the tip radius, and the rigidity and shape of the shell on its mechanical response.",

            "text": "Viruses are captivating nanoscale biological entities that in their simplest form are made by two essential components: a protein shell, also known as a capsid, and RNA or DNA as genetic material [1] . Despite this apparent simplicity, viruses are extremely efficient nanomachines capable of replicating with unparalleled efficiency in a wide variety of hosts and conditions. The most important role of the capsid is to protect the genetic material of the virus. During the extracellular phase viruses face large variations in environmental conditions that could induce extreme changes in temperature, pH, osmotic shocks related to a sudden alteration of salt concentration, or dehydration. In addition, the capsid of many double-stranded DNA viruses has to withstand up to tens of atmospheres of pressure built up during the packaging of the viral genome at high densities [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Moreover, extremophile viruses can live in extreme conditions of salinity, radiation or temperature [8] . Thus, it is very important that the capsid keeps its integrity under environmental changes and survives mechanical stresses during its life cycle. As a consequence viruses have developed amazing mechanical properties. Notable examples are bacteriophage \u03c629 that is capable of withstanding about 50 atms of pressure inside [5, 7, 9] ; or cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) that tolerates broad pH ranges and deformations of more than 30% without breaking [10, 11] .",

Instead of placing the focus on the finest structural details of the nanoindentation of a specific virus, the aim is to provide a highly coarse-grained description, allowing to simulate large viruses at realistic timescales and with the advantage of being able to link the mechanical behavior to the essential physical ingredients of the interaction between capsid's structural units. With the VAFM one can get a better understanding of the mechanical response of viral capsids and how it will be influenced by changes in structure, loading or environmental conditions. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the basics of AFM nanoindentation experiments in the study of viral capsids. Section 3 will be devoted to the description and implementation of the 'Virtual AFM', a Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation mimicking the typical set up of single virus nanoindentation experiments. A detailed explanation of the main parameters of the interactions in the coarse-grained model and how they could be obtained from experiments and full-atom simulations is also provided. Next, we will show how the elastic response of viruses depends on different physical parameters of their effective interactions, including the bending rigidity of the shell, the adsorption to the substrate, the radius of the AFM tip or the capsid shape. Finally, our main findings are summarized in the conclusions.",

In contact operation mode, when the tip touches the sample the cantilever suffers a deflection that is measured by a laser and a photodiode. From the deflection of the cantilever, one can get an accurate topographic image of the sample with nanometer resolution [15, 17] . The deflection can also be translated into a force with a resolution of about 10 pN, using the elastic constant of the cantilever, which can be determined using, for instance, Sader's method [31] .",

The cantilever is then lowered progressively, recording the force and deflection as a function of the vertical position of the tip [15] . A conventional experimental force curve as a function of the indentation is plotted in figure 1 . For small indentations a linear forceresponse can be observed allowing the determination of the particle's effective spring constant from the slope. For larger indentations one can observe a non-linear behavior followed by the presence of strong discontinuities in the force-indentation curve that are often attributed to the mechanical failure of the capsid. The maximum indentation is the value of the indentation at which the first sudden drop in the force occurs, and the corresponding value of the force is identified with the 'breaking force'. These three parameters, namely the effective spring constant, the maximum indentation and the breaking force, are the standard output of nanoindentation experiments. But the challenge is to translate these simple measures into meaningful intrinsic mechanical properties and to identify what are the actual processes responsible for the different features observed in the force-indentation curves.",

On the opposite extreme, full-atom or high-resolution, structure-based coarse-grained simulations of nanoindentation experiments are computationally very costly, specially when applied to large viruses [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . That is the reason why we developed our 'Virtual AFM' described in the next section. Using a high level of coarse-graining one can reach longer timescales and perform efficient simulations while retaining the essential ingredients of the interaction between viral capsid subunits. Our model can be considered as an intermediate approach between continuum descriptions, that ignore the discrete nature of viral capsid proteins and cannot describe virus breaking, and structure-based coarse-grained simulations.

Accordingly, our model [53] is coarse-grained at the level of capsomers, i.e. pentamers and hexamers, which are the basic structural units of a viral shell. These capsomers are represented as effective spheres of two different diameters: \u03c3 h and \u03c3 p , reflecting the fact that hexamers and pentamers are made of a different number of proteins (six and five, respectively), see figure 2 (a). The goal is thus not to provide structurally-detailed information of each individual coat protein but rather to capture the essential physical traits of the effective interactions between capsid's morphological units. Three are the essential ingredients of the interactions required for a successful model of a capsid at this high level of coarse-graining. First, a short range repulsion is needed to mimic steric effects and prevent capsomer overlapping. Second, some kind of binding attraction is vital to keep the integrity of the capsid. Third, an orientational-dependent interaction is necessary to account for the anisotropy of capsomers and to form stable shell-structures rather than compact clusters. Accordingly, the interaction between capsomers is modeled using three contributions: a Mie-like, an angular, and a torsion potential, V = V LJ \u00b7 V a \u00b7 V tor . The Mie-like potential describes the binding and the excluded volume interaction between a pair of capsomers in terms of their relative distance, r ij . The expression used was",

In particular, the diameters \u03c3 h and \u03c3 p represent the effective size of an hexamer and a pentamer, respectively. They can be determined as the diameter of a sphere circumscribing the actual hexameric and pentameric capsomer of a real virus of interest (see figures 3(a) and (b)). The remaining parameters entering into the different interaction potential terms, can be determined for a specific virus either from experiments or atomistic simulations. More specifically, atomistic umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations can be used to the determine the potential of mean force (PMF) between two hexamers or pentamers [60] . Using the distance between the center of masses of two hexamers as reaction coordinate, it is possible to evaluate the atomistic PMF as a function of their separation. This can then be fitted to the Mie expression, equation (3), obtaining the values of m and n, controlling the range of the interaction and ij , representing the minimum of the potential. This procedure has been implemented, for instance, to obtain the effective interaction potential between two CcmK2 hexamers in studies of carboxysome assembly [60] . Alternatively, the effective binding energy between capsomers can be obtained from assembly or calorimetry experiments [61] or estimated by calculating the association energies in the atomistic equilibrium structure, considering the sum of energies due to desolvation, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions between all atoms of the interacting subunits [62] .",

A second abrupt drop in the force is observed when the tip breaks the upper part of the capsid generating a large hole. This cracking of the capsid is not reversible, as shown by the different routes followed by the retraction curves of the tip. The final structure after retraction sometimes is partially healed as shown in the inset figure of a structure missing one pentamer with a small hole and pentamers and hexamers reorganized. Figure 7 shows similar nanoindentation curves obtained when a 'soft' virus, i.e. one with a relatively low bending stiffness, is indented along its 3-fold axis of symmetry. The indentation curves show an initial linear regime followed by an increase in the slope ended by an abrupt drop in the force which in this case is not associated to the breaking of the shell, but rather to its flattening on top of the substrate, as will be discussed in more detail later on. The critical force and indentation associated with the sudden drop of the curves change in different repetitions of the same simulation.

Rather than following this approach, we have opted in the present work to use the VAFM to analyze in global physical terms how the mechanical response of a viral capsid measured in a nanoindentation experiment depends on the physical characteristics of the interaction. In par ticular, we analyze the influence on the mechanical response of different parameters, such as the bending stiffness, related to the parameter \u03b1, the radius of the tip, the adsorption energy of the substrate E ads , and the geometry of the indentation. The results are briefly summarized in the following subsections. Figure 8 shows the influence of the bending rigidity on the indentation along the 5-fold orientation of a T = 7 shell with one type of capsomer. The bending rigidity \u03ba of the shell is dictated by the parameter \u03b1 through equation (11) . As \u03b1 increases, the bending rigidity decreases and the capsid becomes softer, tolerating larger indentations. For \u03b1 \u2208 [0.1, 0.5] the shape of the shell is spherical and the effective spring constant, obtained from the slope of a linear fit for small indentations, decays as k cap \u223c \u221a \u03ba \u223c 1/\u03b1, as predicted by thin-shell theory [17, 35] . The sudden drop in the force curves for \u03b1 = 0.1 and \u03b1 = 0.2 corresponds to a breaking event, associated with the opening of a hole in the upper part of the capsid. However, for \u03b1 = 0.3 the capsid is very soft, and resists large indentations (of up to 75% of its radius), until its final collapse into a pancakelike shell. For \u03b1 > 0.3, the shell becomes progressively more faceted. This faceting is noticeable by an increase in its 5-fold height, signalled in the figure by the shifting in the contact point towards negative values. For \u03b1 > 0.6 the shell undergoes a buckling transition [43] , as indicated by the change in height. The several drops observed in the measured force are due to a progressive faceting or flattening of the shell on top of the substrate rather than to an actual breaking event (which is unlikely because the structure is very soft).",

We have analyzed the influence of the adsorption strength with the substrate on the indentation curves for capsids of different bending rigidity. Figure 9 shows the results for a relatively rigid shell with \u03b1 = 0.1. At small values of the adsorption energy, E ads < 1, the capsid keeps its nominal height and the slope of the indentation curves is insensitive to E ads . However the maximum value of the indentation before the first drop in the force occurs goes down as the adsorption gets stronger. The drop corresponds in this case to the flattening of the bottom part of the virus induced by the applied force. For 1 < E ads < 4, the bottom pentamer and the five surrounding hexamers are initially adsorbed on the substrate leading to a well-defined initial height of the capsid which is smaller than the nominal height (reflected in figure 9 by a shift of the contact point between the tip and the sample).",

Contrarily, for indentations along the 3-fold axis of symmetry (see figure 10 (b)), the tip is placed in the space between three hexamers, and the contact height depends on the tip size, as indicated by the shift of initial contact points. In addition, the slopes are different and increase continuously with the tip radius up to converging to a constant value for very large, essentially flat, tips.

            "text": "One of the most representative characteristics of both experimental and simulated indentation curves are abrupt drops in the force, that occur after the initial linear regime. These force drops have been traditionally attributed to capsid breaking, see figure 1 (a). However, in the simulations we see that many different physical phenomena can happen with the same signature corresponding to a drop in the force. The advantage of the simulations is that one can correlate the observed drops in the force with snapshots obtained from the simulations. In that way, we have observed that sudden drops in the force correspond, very often in an indistinguishable way, to breaking, buckling, rotation and/or sliding. Rotation and sliding are the most common cause of sudden drops in the force when the capsid is not properly immobilized on the substrate. When rotation and sliding are prevented, one could still observe breaking, buckling, and reorganization of capsomers, see figure 11 . It is important to distinguish between breaking and buckling events. Breaking is defined as the disruption of the capsid involving rupture of intercapsomer bonds. This is typically an irreversible phenomenon that is associated with the presence of a crack or hole in the capsid (see figure 11 (a)), as can be observed also in AFM experiments. Breaking is important for the life cycle of virus, since it will expose the genome. In nanotechnological applications it is indispensable to prevent the unwanted breaking of the shell for nanoencapsulation. In a buckling process there is a collective change in the position of several capsomers, leading to a faceting of the structure, without cracks, see figure 11 (c). If the indentation stops just after a buckling event and the tip is retracted we could observe very often that this buckling is reversible.",

The second drop corresponds to the collapse of the bottom pentamer, that adopts the same z-position as the hexamers around it and the third drop is when the structure actually breaks. In experimental force curves the force drops are identical to the ones observed in the simulations, but the mechanism involved in the drop is unknown in most cases. It is usual to interpret always a drop in the force as a breaking event. But with the help of our simulation one can see that this is not always correct, and that the mechanism depends on the elastic characteristic of the capsid. When the bending rigidity of the shell is large, the shell is more fragile, and breaking events are usually the most probable cause of force drops. Buckling appears normally for low values of bending stiffness, corresponding to soft shells that deform easily, preventing rupture.",

Thus, in its present form, our model cannot capture realistically the complicated changes associated to viral maturation. However, the order of the spring constant for our polyhedral shell is the same as that found in nanoindentation experiments for the mature T7 capsid [30] . Remarkably, the anisotropic elasticity obtained from AFM indentation experiments of T7 viral capsids does not follow the anisotropy expected from continuum homogenous models [23] . Whereas the experimental results show the spring constant of T7 capsids for each icosahedral symmetry axis as k 5c < k 3c < k 2c , FEM simulations of the stiffness performed in thin shell continuum models establishes k 5 < k 2 < k 3 [30] . In addition, FE simulations of a thin or thick icosahedral shell with the same dimensions as T7 also predict an incorrect order of the spring constants. Remarkably, the results obtained with our VAFM reproduce the same order of the effective spring constants found in the experiments (i.e. k 5c < k 3c < k 2c ). This suggests that the distinct stiffnesses for the different orientations found in the T7 capsid are associated to the discrete nature of its structural components and to their particular arrangement in the final structure.",

This 'Virtual AFM' is a very useful tool to investigate the mechanical properties of viruses, and how they change with the relevant physical parameters. With this tool it is also possible to interpret real experiments, providing a simple way to account for the influence of the discrete structure of the capsid, and obtaining very useful information about the physical ingredients involved in the mechanical response of viral capsids.",

            "text": "Our 'Virtual AFM' has been already useful to interpret experiments performed on bacteriophage T7 [30] . The simulations explain the unusual anisotropic stiffness found in these experiments, and reproduce qualitatively the experimental results. We have also analyzed how the measured stiffness depends on different physical parameters, and on the shape of the virus. In particular, we have shown that the measured spring constant not only depends on the Young's modulus of the shell but also on the local bending rigidity between subunits. We have also analyzed the influence of the adsorption with the substrate on the elastic response of a virus. Our findings suggest that the effective spring constant of the virus is almost insensitive to the substrate, but the virus height, breaking forces and maximum indentations depend on the adsorption strength and the bending rigidity of the virus. The radius of the AFM tip has a minor influence on the measured slope, associated with changes in the contact area. We have also shown that sudden drops in the force are not always a signature of breaking of the shell. Adsorption, faceting and buckling can also lead to indistinguishable force drops, evidencing that caution has to be taken in the interpretation of experiments. Finally, we have found that viruses show an anisotropic elastic response where the relative magnitude of the spring constants not only depend on the triangulation number, but also on the shape of the shell. Although in this work we have focused on the T = 7 structure, the Virtual AFM can be a useful tool for many future studies of indentation, buckling and breaking of different T-number viruses.",

The initial linear response ends abruptly by a sudden drop, in this case due to the fracture of the shell. Data courtesy of de Pablo's group. (b) A similar curve obtained in our simulations for a T = 7 shell. In the simulation, the sudden drop in the force is due to the breaking of the upper part of the virus. After the breaking event, the remaining part of the shell partially recovers its height, offering resistance to further indentation, as indicated by the subsequent increase in the force.",
