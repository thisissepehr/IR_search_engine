Contracts with infection prevention services could be considered to support standalone or smaller system clinics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The first step in setting up a program is to convene a multidisciplinary program oversight committee composed of the practice's clinical and financial leadership to obtain buy-in and resource commitment, along with ongoing oversight of the program. Once the institution makes a commitment, the infection prevention team is formed. This team will ideally consist of at least an infectious diseases-trained medical director and an infection prevention specialist. The next step is to draft policies and/or procedures, creating a framework for the team to enforce CDC and professional society recommendations. Next, we found it useful to perform a census of all practice clinics and settings to ascertain the scope of the services being performed, including which locations perform sterilization and HLD. As in the hospital setting, it is important to perform an initial and yearly infection control risk assessment to identify and prioritize high-risk areas and activities such as injections, infusions, reprocessing of reusable medical devices, and procedures such as vein ablations. Once the risk assessment is complete, a standardized survey tool that incorporates elements of the CDC checklists [5] , along with items in the newly created policies, can be utilized to perform a baseline survey to determine areas for improvement and future educational opportunities. A sample checklist can be found in Table 1 . Eventually, as the program continues to develop, follow-up surveys are performed. The following sections describe high-priority items and major areas of focus when rolling out an infection prevention program. [11] . Employees who reprocess instruments and administer injectable medications should complete additional training that incorporates competency evaluation. In order to maintain or update infection prevention knowledge, it is important to administer continuing education through an annual online overview course and annual competency evaluations. Despite education, health care workers can develop a \"this is not the hospital\" attitude. The absence of routine outcome measures and microbial surveillance perpetuates this attitude. In fact, ambulatory clinics are an extension of hospitals in the continuum of care as patients are typically managed in the outpatient setting, including pre-admission and after discharge. A potential downfall of perceiving the clinic environment as safer than the hospital is illustrated by an outbreak of group A Streptococcus among patients in an outpatient clinic due to ignoring numerous infection prevention practices [12] . The clinic was noted to have lapses in disinfection of multi-use items between patients, glove use, hand hygiene, and in implementing contact precautions.
