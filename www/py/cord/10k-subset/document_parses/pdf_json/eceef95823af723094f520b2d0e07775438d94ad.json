These mAbs were successfully used for detection and quantification of ACE by ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In all these applications mainly single mAbs were used. We hypothesized that we can obtain a completely new kind of information about ACE structure and function if we use the whole set of mAbs directed to different epitopes on the ACE molecule. When we finished epitope mapping of all mAbs to ACE (and especially, those recognizing conformational epitopes), we realized that we had obtained a new tool to study ACE. First, we demonstrated that binding of some mAbs is very sensitive to local conformational changes on the ACE surface-due to local denaturation, inactivation, ACE inhibitor or mAbs binding or due to diseases. Second, we were able to detect, localize and characterize several human ACE mutations. And, finally, we established a new concept-conformational fingerprinting of ACE using mAbs that in turn allowed us to obtain evidence for tissue specificity of ACE, which has promising scientific and diagnostic perspectives. The initial goal for the generation of mAbs to ACE 30 years ago was obtaining mAbs to organ-specific endothelial cells, which could be used for organ-specific drug delivery. Our systematic work on characterization of mAbs to numerous epitopes on ACE during these years has lead not only to the generation of the most effective mAbs for specific drug/gene delivery into the lung capillaries, but also to the establishment of the concept of conformational fingerprinting of ACE, which in turn gives a theoretical base for the generation of mAbs, specific for ACE from different organs. We believe that this concept could be applicable for any glycoprotein against which there is a set of mAbs to different epitopes.",

Later we demonstrated that even simple adsorption of catalytically active ACE to the plastic for ELISA results in partial denaturation [34] .

To exclude the possible masking effect of the N-domain on the immune response to epitopes located on the C-domain of the ACE (due to the masking of part of the C domain of the N-domain globule [37] ), the mice were immunized with purified recombinant testicular ACE (expressed in CHO cells), which contains only the C-domain.

Since the combined work of more than 100 genes is responsible for the glycosylation of human proteins [56] , it could be assumed (and experimental evidences were obtained) that the combined expression of these genes (and hence the glyco-sylation of the same protein) should differ in different organs [57] . This can be schematically represented as follows: the ACE gene encoding the amino acid sequence of the protein is the same in all organs (like my daughter's face), whereas the set of sugars (glycans) decorating various ACE glycosylation sites (and hence the surface conformation of the ACE) is different in different organs (as well as my daughter's hair, Fig. 1b) .

There were statistically significant differences in the binding efficiency of mAb 1G12 to the N-domain and mAb 1B3 to the C-domain of the enzyme in four patients out of 20 ( Fig. 3 in [45] ). Changes were affected not only the surface of the protein, but also affected its catalytic functions. It turned out that the conformationally altered ACE is characterized by an increased (up to 4 times) activity with respect to the natural substrate angiotensin I, less efficiently inhibited by a specific ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (tripeptide analogue widely used as an antihypertensive agent) and practically was not inhibited by another ACE inhibitor-nonapeptide teprotide. We also analyzed a large sample of blood plasma from healthy donors [48] and patients without uremia [62] and found eight cases of the same conformationally altered ACE as with uremia-which are less susceptible to specific ACE inhibitors [45] . Thus, patients with such conformationally altered ACE in their blood should probably be given more intensive therapy with ACE inhibitors, or replace them with antihypertensive agents of another class.",

We found (together with Vladimir Muzykantov) that radioactively labeled mAb 9B9 is extremely effective (up to 50% of the administered dose [73] and specificity (30-50 times more than in other organs and blood) accumulate in the lung [74] [75] [76] . Later we mapped the epitope for mAb 9B9 [42] and also determined the reason for such specific accumulation of mAbs to ACE in the lung. The fact is that 100% of the capillaries of the lungs express ACE (versus 5-15% of the ACE-positive capillaries in the systemic circulation) [9] , whereas in healthy kidneys neither the glomerular endothelium nor the intercellular endothelium produce ACE in general [9] . Such heterogeneous expression of ACE along the vascular bed with preferential expression in the capillaries of the lung provides a specific accumulation of antibodies in the lung during systemic administration.",

Excessive accumulation of adenoviruses in the liver even caused the death of one of the first patients subjected to gene therapy in 1999 [79] . When we \"coated\" (using a bispecific reagent) adenoviruses with mAb against ACE (9B9), we found not only a 20-fold increase in the specific accumulation of such \"targeted\" viruses in the lung, but also a 5-fold decrease in the accumulation of viruses in the liver [80] .

Specificity of delivery of reporter transgene into the lungs via mAb to ACE. (a) Rat lungs transfected in vivo with adenoviruses with a reporter transgene (CEA) and \"coated\" with mAbs against ACE are stained with antibodies against CEA. Expression of the transgene (brown staining), was absent in the lungs of rats transfected with viruses with transgene, but not \"coated\" with anti-ACE mAb (adapted from Fig. 6a in [80] ). (b) The activity of the reporter gene (luciferase) was evaluated in different organs of the rat 3 days after adenovirus adenovirus administration (AdCMVLuc (2 \u00d7 10 9 pfu)) and expressed through luciferase activity (RLU), normalized to 1 mg protein. The mean values of three experiments + SEM (adapted from Fig. 4a in [80] ) are presented. Expression of the reporter gene from the virus, \"coated\" with mAb against ACE, increased in the lungs by 20 times (upper left graph) and decreased in the liver 5 times (upper right graph). We were able to clone the genes of heavy and light chains of the most used mAb 9B9 and get its fragment (scFv). However, the binding affinity of this fragment fell by two orders of magnitude [93] . Nevertheless, our results allow us to hope for successful clinical application of this approach, which is impossible, however, when using mAb of mouse origin. The fact is that the production of the first antibodies (especially to tumor antigens) gave rise to an extraordinary revival in the biomedical and biotechnological world, since it seemed that a \"magic bullet\" was about to appear to treat cancer. However, pretty soon it became clear that mouse mAbs cannot be used as therapeutic, as injections of such mAbs lead to a significant production of antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins-Human-Anti-Mouse Antibodies (HAMA) response. Therefore, in the 1980s, various approaches were developed to \"humanize\" mouse mAbs and to obtain antibodies using \"humanized\" mice [94] .",

The region of epitopes is shown by circles with a diameter of about 25-30 \u00c5, which corresponds to an area of 600-900 \u00c5 2 . Most epitopes contain potential glycosylation sites-colored green (the pattern is adapted fromFig. 1 in [50]). (b) Diagram illustrating the concept of conformational fingerprinting of ACE. The identical face of the girl in all the pictures reflects the presence of one gene that encodes the amino acid sequence of an ACE molecule in different organs (and cells) of a human. Different hairstyles mean that the glycosylation of ACE in different organs and cells can differ significantly, which leads to differences in the local surface conformation of ACE in different organs and cells.",
