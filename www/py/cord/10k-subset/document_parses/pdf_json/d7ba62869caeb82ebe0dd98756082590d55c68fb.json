It is therefore important to understand the full spectrum of GH signaling pathways and cellular responses. We applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics combined with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture to identify proteins rapidly phosphorylated in response to GH in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. We identified 132 phosphosites in 95 proteins that exhibited rapid (5 or 15 min) GH-dependent statistically significant increases in phosphorylation by more than or equal to 50% and 96 phosphosites in 46 proteins that were downregulated by GH by more than or equal to 30%. Several of the GH-stimulated phosphorylation sites were known (e.g. regulatory Thr/Tyr in Erks 1 and 2, Tyr in signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and 5b, Ser939 in tuberous sclerosis protein (TSC) 2 or tuberin). The remaining 126 GH-stimulated sites were not previously associated with GH. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of GH-stimulated sites indicated enrichment in proteins associated with the insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesions. Akt/protein kinase A consensus sites (RXRXXS/T) were the most commonly phosphorylated consensus sites. Immunoblotting confirmed GH-stimulated phosphorylation of all seven novel GH-dependent sites tested [regulatory sites in proline-rich Akt substrate, 40 kDA (PRAS40), regulatory associated protein of mTOR, ATP-citrate lyase, Na \u03e9 /H \u03e9 exchanger-1, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1, and Shc]). The immunoblot results suggest that many, if not most, of the GHstimulated phosphosites identified in this large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis, including sites in multiple proteins in the Akt/ mTOR complex 1 pathway, are phosphorylated in response to GH. Their identification significantly broadens our thinking of GH-regulated cell functions.

GH signaling is initiated by GH binding to a GH receptor dimer, which leads to activation of the GH receptor-associated Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) (5, 6) . The activated JAK2 phosphorylates tyrosines within itself and the GH receptor, forming binding sites for Src Homology (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins, such as the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) (reviewed in Refs. 7 and 8) . In addition to signaling through Stats, GH activates the Ras/Raf/MAPK kinase (MEK)1/Erks 1/2 pathway (9, 10) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTORC1 pathway (11) (12) (13) (14) . GH has also been shown, often in a cell-specific manner, to activate members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (15) and to stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of a variety of other proteins, including transmembrane proteins (e.g. SIRP1\u2423), phosphatases (e.g. SHP2), adapter proteins (e.g. SH2B1, CrkII), and proteins associated with the cytoskeleton (e.g. p130Cas/Bcar1) (16 -18) .

However, due to the low stoichiometry of phosphorylation and high complexity of samples isolated from whole cells, global analysis of protein phosphorylation in cells by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) remains challenging. Enrichment of phosphopeptides before LC-MS using metal oxides (TiO 2 , ZrO 2 ) (25, 26) , immobilized metal affinity chromatography (27, 28) , and phosphopeptide-specific antibodies (29) have been used to selectively enrich phosphopeptides from complex peptide mixtures and dramatically improve the detection of phosphopeptides. We employed a MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approach that combined immunoaffinity purification, ZrO 2 , and LC-tandem MS (MSMS) with SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) (30) to identify and quantify rapid (5 and 15 min) GH-dependent changes in protein phosphorylation in the highly GH-sensitive 3T3-F442A preadipocyte cell line. SILAC-based protein quantification has been widely used to study dynamic changes in protein expression levels (31) (32) (33) (34) because it enables samples to be combined and processed simultaneously, eliminating the differences within individual runs that are due to variation in sample handling during the extensive sample processing. This proteomic analysis enabled us to identify close to 1800 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 132 were found to be up-regulated by GH and 96 down-regulated by GH.

The broad range of functions for these 132 GH-responsive proteins, both metabolic and structural, suggests that further study of these proteins has the potential to provide a molecular basis for the many GH responses (51) that are only beginning to be understood. To gain insight into pathways activated by GH, we used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) to categorize the proteins that contain phosphosites that increased with GH treatment at 5 or 15 min (Table 2) . Four pathways contained five or more proteins that exhibited GH-dependent phosphorylation. The four pathways identified by KEGG have obvious functional overlaps and not surprisingly, several proteins are present in two or more pathways. The identification of previously unknown, GHregulated proteins in two of the categories (\"regulation of the actin cytoskeleton,\" and \"focal adhesions\") highlights proteins that have the potential to broaden our understanding of the mechanistic basis underlying the ability of GH to promote changes in the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) . In the category \"regulation of the actin cytoskeleton,\" the phosphosites in protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12a (Ppp1r12a)/Mypt1/myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, NHE1, and myosin heavy chain 9 were not previously known to be GH regulated. In the category \"focal adhesion,\" the phosphosites in filamin, zyxin, parvin, and Ppp1r12a were not previously known to be GH regulated. The identification of proteins in the categories \"insulin signaling pathway\" and \"mTOR signaling pathway\" that exhibit increased levels of phosphorylation in GH-treated cells are consistent with the known role of GH in the regulation of metabolism and cell growth (1, 2). Erk1, Erk2, and TSC2 were known previously to be phosphorylated in response to GH on the sites we identified. The phosphosites in raptor and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) were not previously known to be GH-regulated sites. Manual examination of the functions reported for proteins in our proteomic analysis revealed two additional proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway, each with two GH-up-regulated sites: PRAS40, which, like raptor, is part of the mTORC1 complex, and programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), which, like eIF4B, is a target of S6 kinase (Fig. 3) .

However, immunoblotting confirmed all seven sites tested, even those with the most subtle increases, including four that were picked up in only one of the three screens, supporting our contention that for the GH up-regulated phosphosites, identification in even a single screen makes that site likely to be a bona fide GH-regulated site.

Studies using yeast revealed that different modes of enriching for phosphopeptides sample quite different subpopulations of the phosphoproteome with little overlap among them. Use of four different enrichment methods significantly increased the coverage of the phosphopeptide population (Kweon and Andrews, manuscript in preparation), suggesting that future studies would benefit from combining the results from multiple, complementary enrichment schemes. Third, in the modern LC-mass spectrometer, for each successive peak fraction selected by the nano LC system for analysis, two steps are performed: first, the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer obtains a single MS survey scan in the Orbitrap analyzer, then for the seven most intense precursor ions from each MS survey scan, sequential MSMS scans are obtained in the LTQ to determine their peptide sequence. Due to the highly complex samples obtained from the cell lysates and the limited sequencing speed at the MSMS sequencing step, modern mass spectrometers are only capable of sequencing approximately 16% of the precursor ions present (47) . Thus, the relative abundance of a phosphopeptide greatly influences the probability that the ion derived from a particular phosphopeptide will be selected for MSMS sequencing. It is not surprising that in analytical replicates, and certainly with biological replicates, the ions from less abundant phosphopeptides might not be consistently selected due to slight changes in chromatography at either the SCX, ZrO 2 , or LC-MS steps (73) (74) (75) . As evidence of variation in selecting different precursor ions for sequencing, in our study, the inclusion of a technical replicate increased the number of identified peptides by about 20% on average. Furthermore, for low-abundance precursor ions, the quality of the MSMS spectra deteriorates, thus making it more difficult to obtain protein sequence. The fraction of identified peptides following the MSMS sequencing step has been determined to be approximately 60% for abundant precursor ions, but drops to about 10% for low-abundance ions (47) . In our typical screen, of the approximately 10,000 spectra we obtained, about 30% were identified. Fourth, the low expression levels of regulatory proteins and low stoichiometry of their phosphorylation further increases the difficulty of detecting phosphorylation events (76) . It is well known that compared with many growth factors, stimulation of cells with GH does not produce a very robust signaling response. In 3T3-F442A cells, the signaling response to GH is much less than for platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor (77) . Therefore, identifying GH-dependent phosphosites is likely to be particularly challenging. Finally, many phosphorylation sites are not identifiable either because the tryptic fragments are too large or too small for identification or because their sequence-specific properties lead to low efficiency ionization or fragmentation. However, based on the validation that we did with our immunoblotting studies, even those phosphopeptides that were detected in only one screen have a high likelihood of being valid and certainly provide sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation of all the identified phosphosites.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1177, "end": 1193, "text": "(13, 45, 69 -72)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2649, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3083, "end": 3087, "text": "(73)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 3088, "end": 3092, "text": "(74)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3093, "end": 3097, "text": "(75)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 3642, "end": 3646, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3921, "end": 3925, "text": "(76)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 4194, "end": 4198, "text": "(77)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Using immunoblot analysis, we confirmed the phosphoproteomics results for all seven of the GH-stimulated sites tested, which included nearly all of the phosphosites for which phosphospecific antibodies were available.

We identified phosphorylation sites in proteins previously reported to be phosphorylated in response to GH (Erk1, Erk2, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Shc) but the vast majority of the identified phosphosites (125 of the 132 GH-up-regulated sites) were in proteins not previously known to be regulated by GH. Based on the high degree of reproducibility (\u03fe90%) for GH regulation when a phosphosite was detected in more than one screen, and the high degree of validation (100%) of sites by Western blotting (including sites identified in only one screen), SILACbased phosphoproteomics analysis is a very powerful method to detect novel GH-regulated proteins. In a single experiment, we detected 1 order of magnitude more candidate GH-regulated proteins than we have detected using other techniques (yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, immobilized phosphopeptide pull-down, Tap-tagged and Flag-tagged coimmunoprecipitation, and cloning of ligand targets assays involving JAK2 and/or GH receptor) and observed a much higher rate of verification of candi-date proteins (i.e. the proportion of false positives was substantially lower). This is probably at least in part due to: 1) our SILAC-based phosphoproteomics analysis method not requiring overexpression of any proteins or artificial treatment or manipulation of any protein, other than growing some of the cells in heavy-labeled amino acids, and 2) the fact that the GH-treated and untreated cell lysates were processed together in a combined sample.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although GH signaling has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Akt (13, 45) , the prominent representation of Akt/mTOR pathway components in our phosphoproteomics analysis (Table 3 ) was unexpected.

Given the shared roles of GH and mTORC1 in regulating protein synthesis as well as organ and body growth, it makes sense that GH activates Akt-regulated mTORC1 signaling. Before this work, only one GH-initiated pathway leading from Akt to the mTORC1 complex had been identified: phosphorylation of TSC2 Ser939 (14) . Our phosphoproteomics analysis coupled with studies using wortmannin to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway revealed that GH stimulates the phosphorylation of numerous proteins in the Akt-mTORC1 pathway, including: 1) Akt-mediated TSC2 Ser939 phosphorylation, which suppresses TSC2 function and thus inhibits the activity of mTORC1 (49, 50) ; 2) Akt-mediated PRAS40 Thr247 phosphorylation, which is thought to contribute to relief of PRAS40-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 (59, 60) ; and 3) mTOR as well as Erk1/2-mediated raptor Ser863 phosphorylation, which has been shown to promote multisite raptor phosphorylation and augment mTORC1 activity (36, 57, 58) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 71, "end": 75, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 76, "end": 79, "text": "45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 761, "end": 765, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1097, "text": "(49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "(59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1241, "text": "60)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1411, "text": "(36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1415, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1419, "text": "58)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 184, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Additionally, among the sites in our phosphoproteomics analysis that we have verified by immunoblotting, several potential novel functions of GH have been revealed. Because phosphorylation of Ser455 in ACLY has been shown to increase ACLY-dependent synthesis of acetyl-CoA (67), our finding that GH stimulates phosphorylation of ACLY Ser455 suggests that GH may increase acetyl-CoA synthesis. Acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA in fatty acid synthesis. Thus, activation of ACLY would be consistent with the known rapid and transitory insulin-like stimulatory effects of GH on lipogenesis (78) . Similarly, because phosphorylation of NHE1 at Ser707 has been shown to increase NHE1 activity (35) , our finding that GH stimulates the phosphorylation of NHE1 Ser707 suggests that GH may activate the Na \u03e9 /H \u03e9 exchange function of NHE1. Consistent with a multipronged regulation of proteins and pathways, GH may also increase NHE1 activity in a calmodulindependent manner. GH binds its receptor and activates the tyrosine kinase, JAK2. JAK2 activation has previously been reported to phosphorylate calmodulin, resulting in increased interaction of calmodulin with NHE1 and increased NHE1 activity (79) .

It has also been shown to increase the motility of 293T cells stably expressing GH receptor (56) and the directed migration of monocytes (52, 55) and RAW264.7 macrophages (Su, H.-W., and C. Carter-Su, manuscript in preparation). During cell migration, focal complexes assemble at the leading edge and then disassemble as a cell moves. Some focal complexes mature and recruit new proteins; these focal adhesions anchor cells to the matrix and are important for cell movement. Multiple focal adhesion proteins have been shown to undergo GHdependent changes in tyrosyl phosphorylation (18, 81, 82) . Of the seven proteins containing GH-enhanced phosphosites identified by KEGG analysis as \"focal adhesion\" proteins, four (filamin, zyxin, parvin, Ppp1r12a/regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase) had not been identified previously as GHregulated proteins.

This analysis suggests that pathways that activate these kinases or kinases with similar substrate specificity may play an important role in GH signaling. Of these kinases, Akt is the only one known to be stimulated by GH (13) . Our present findings and previous work of others (14) provide evidence that a number of the identified Akt phosphorylation consensus sites are phosphorylated by Akt in response to GH (e.g. TSC2 Ser939, Tensin-3 Ser769 2.0/\u03ea/\u03ea PRAS40 Thr247, ACLY Ser455). However, because of overlap within kinase substrate consensus sequences and because the MaxQuant analysis of consensus phosphorylation motifs does not use a comprehensive list of kinases, some of the identified \"consensus\" phosphosites are likely to be phosphorylated primarily by a related kinase. For instance, GH signaling reportedly inhibits GSK3 (45) . Thus, our finding that GH signaling increases phosphorylation of GSK3 consensus sites suggests that GSK3 does not represent the physiological kinase for these sites. Instead, another, perhaps related, kinase that responds positively to GH, seems more likely to be the responsible kinase. Akt is a member of the AGC family of kinases. Family members Akt and SGK1 are both reported to phosphorylate Ser and Thr that lie in RXRXXS/T motifs (83, 84) . Rather than Akt/PKA, which was identified as the most likely kinase(s) by MaxQuant, the AGC kinase member SGK1 is thought to phosphorylate NDRG1 Thr328 and Ser330 (65) . The AGC family member p90 RSK (RXXS motif) is thought to be the kinase that phosphorylates NHE1 Ser707 (85) . At least one of the kinases identified in our motif analysis, CK2, is thought to be constitutively active (86) . CK2 was recently reported to both associate with JAK2 and, in an in vitro assay, phosphorylate JAK2 (86) . Additionally, CK2 inhibitors were found to depress GH-induced activation of STAT5, consistent with CK2 playing a role in GH signaling. With kinases like CK2 that are constitutively active, the regulation of ligand-dependent signaling likely requires a change in the conformation of protein substrates or altered subcellular localization of substrates or kinases to permit phosphorylation. Therefore, for potential substrates of CK2, it may be informative to determine whether any GH-dependent changes in subcellular localization of the substrates can be detected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 493, "end": 497, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1498, "text": "(83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1502, "text": "84)", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1672, "text": "(65)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1782, "text": "(85)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1895, "text": "(86)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2002, "text": "(86)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, these studies are the first studies to use mass-spectrometry and SILAC-based phosphoproteomics to identify novel proteins involved in GH signaling.
