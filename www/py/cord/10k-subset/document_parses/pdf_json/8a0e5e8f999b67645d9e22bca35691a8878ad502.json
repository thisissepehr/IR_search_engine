Global influenza surveillance work has been led by WHO since the early 1950s and although pandemics occurred at irregular intervals in the 20 th Century and before (. Fig. 1 ) formal national and international pandemic planning only started late in the 20 th century. The first published national pandemic plans appeared in Europe in the 1990s, some stimulated by the emergence of a potential pandemic influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong in 1997 [2] . The first WHO guidance pandemic plan appeared in 1999 but was based on limited international consultation [3] . More considered work began in early 2002 with the formal development of a global influenza agenda including pandemic planning [4, 5] leading to a resolution at the World Health Assembly in 2003, This also contained the first targets for seasonal influenza immunisation [6] . The experience of SARS in 2003, another albeit considerably different acute respiratory viral infection, gave stimulus to this work as did the development of the first comprehensive International Health Regulations (IHR 2005 ) that could be used when declaring a pandemic [7] . The first proper global guidance on pandemic planning was adopted by WHO in 2005 along with a seminal checklist [8, 9] .",

The ECDC did this by drawing from the expertise of its four Technical Units (Health Communications, Preparedness and Response, which led the pandemic preparedness activities; Scientific Advice, which hosts the coordination of the influenza work, and Surveillance). Working in support of Member States and the European Commission the ECDC initially developed a simple assessment procedure to strengthen pandemic preparedness in the EU and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and started a series of visits (. Tab. 1). It did so in collaboration with the European Commission (EC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO-EURO). At the same time the ECDC developed close linkages with WHO Headquarters since that has the main influenza expertise globally and leads the work of pandemic preparedness and response.",

The ECDC has no regulatory function and can only issue guidance (that is documents on a topic offering options with their pros and cons, operational aspects and the relevant scientific evidence). It can rarely offer recommendations or directions. Also it can only become involved in a country's preparedness when invited. However with strong leadership from the European Health Commissioner (Mr Kyprianou 2005-2008), the European Commission and successive EU Presidency Countries (notably those of the UK, Austria, France and Sweden) all EU and EEA countries welcomed and supported the ECDC's approach to the extent of seeking an ECDC assessment.",

Following piloting with Swedish authorities the visits began in the summer of 2005 (. Tab. 1). The initial procedure was a classical external assessment relying on a visiting team (usually but not always led by a senior member of the ECDC or EURO staff but with some members from the EC and EURO). The team visited countries for 3-4 days, checking plans against the WHO templates and making a limited number of visits to a few convenient national institutions. A standard questionnaire was completed during the visit, based on the WHO check-list, and those questions became the first ECDC Indicators of Pandemic Preparedness. This followed the broad structure recommended by the WHO documents with the five WHO guidance categories: planning and coordination, situation monitoring and assessment, prevention and reduction of transmission, health system response and communication. Following the visit the ECDC would send a written report to the country which remained unpublished.",

Strenuous work to improve preparedness was led by WHO (human health), the European Commission and other animal health agencies (FAO and OIE) [12, 13] . Many countries secured stockpiles of antiviral agents, principally oseltamivir [14] . In response to this items on preparedness for avian influenza outbreaks were added to the ECDC indicators and joint work was sought with Ministries of Health and Agriculture during the visits. However\"bird flu\" was almost a distraction for ECDC in that it had to develop a suite of risk assessment and guidance documents for what was an animal influenza what could occasionally infect humans [15, 16] . While human infections with A(H5N1) often had lethal consequences to date no such infections have occurred in the EU/EEA countries and the virus has as yet failed to fully adapt to humans and transmit efficiently from person to person [16] . With hindsight this severe threat led most Member States, ECDC and WHO to focus on planning for a much more severe pandemic than transpired in 2009. Preparing for a severe threat was a very defensible first step but it should of course have moved on to planning for mild as well as severe eventualities [17, 18] .",

Between 2005 and 2008 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) worked with the European Commission (EC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO-Euro) to assist European countries in preparing themselves for a future influenza pandemic. All eligible countries in the European Union and European Economic Area participated with energy and commitment. Indicators of preparedness were developed based on WHO planning guidance and these were set within a simple assessment which included a formal country visit. The procedure evolved considerably with field experience. As the complexity of pandemic preparedness was appreciated it changed from being a classical short external assessment to longer national self-assessments with demonstrable impact, especially when self-assessments were published. There were essential supporting activities undertaken including a series of pan-European pandemic pre-paredness workshops organised by EC, WHO-Euro, ECDC and countries holding the European Union Presidency. The self-assessments highlighted additional work and documentation that was needed by national authorities from the ECDC. This work was undertaken and the document produced. The benefits of the self-assessments were seen in the 2009 pandemic in that EU/EEA countries performed better than some others. A number of the guidance documents were updated to fit the specific features of the pandemic. However the pandemic revealed many weaknesses and brought new challenges for European countries, notably over communication and vaccines, the need to prepare for a variety of scenarios and to factor severity estimates into preparedness, to improve surveillance for severe disease and to deliver seroepidemiology. Any revised self-assessment procedure will need to respond to these challenges. then became a collaborative effort with an in-country lead and all the national country agencies involved in influenza preparedness as essential players.",

This experience and further national exercises which were stimulated by Common Ground led to an appreciation that the assessments had to include Practices and that these were the third P joining Plans and Preparedness.

To identify areas where support from the ECDC or other partner agencies should be requested Ground rules 1. There is transparency between ECDC and the national authorities operating as a joint assessment team led by ECDC. Essentially it is a structured self-assessment by the country of the country but facilitated by and led by an external team (for EU and EEA countries the lead is by ECDC) 2. The assessment report will not be used to make comparisons between countries except where it is agreed that comparisons can be made, e.g. vaccine coverage 3. Examples of good practices and innovations are shared with other countries with the knowledge of the country concerned to encourage to make them public through the ECDC webpage 4. Reports and the results of the assessment process are not shared by ECDC with third parties without the written consent of the national authorities 5. Those people on the external team members who are not members of ECDC staff work to the ECDC team leader and do not share the findings with other members of their own organisation without the team leader's permission and the knowledge of the country authorities 6. Any contact with the media is by the country concerned shop it was appreciated that in addition to evaluating written plans, the self-assessments needed to determine the extent that they had been translated into preparedness at different levels in the countries, for example whether or not complementary standard operating procedures and contingency arrangements had been developed, staff educated and trained, equipment and supplies ordered and local business continuity planning undertaken. These facets were added to the procedure and indicators [20, 21] . Particular examples are the delivery of antivirals and vaccines. While a country may have acquired a national stockpile of oseltamivir and have an Advance Purchase Agreement for specific pandemic vaccines that will be to no effect if the plans are not there for and practised for getting the drugs and vaccines to local practitioners and then onto the public. To assist in this ECDC developed what it called acid tests 2 for countries to self apply to convince themselves that they could deliver countermeasures to citizens (. Tab. 5, [27] ).",

The importance of nonhealth sectors was appreciated for two reasons. Firstly a pandemic threat could temporarily remove up to 20% of working adults through illness or having to care for others and so threaten the functioning of core activities well beyond the health sector. Pandemic business continuity planning was needed, for example the power industry, food and fuel supplies. Secondly while there was agreement that certain public health measures might constitute significant countermeasures to reduce peak illness prevalence those in the social distancing category required cross sectoral preparation action [29] . For example proactive school closures needed close coordination between education, health and other sectors at national and local levels [30] . Therefore in their updating the ECDC procedures increasingly required their health sector counterparts to involve other sectors, business and civil society. At the same time some EU countries started to publish cross government or whole society plans and eventually the French Presidency Angers Workshop in 2008 led to formal EU Health Council Recommendations on the need for multi-sectoral planning in pandemic preparedness [20, 21] .",

At the request of the health commissioner two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken by ECDC with EU/ EEA Member States in 2006 and 2007 asking them to indicate their performance on the indicators. A sensitive question has been whether performance on preparedness indicators should be centrally monitored in the EU? A number of Member States made it clear to the ECDC that the country-specific results should only be known to the country, that they should not pass beyond the ECDC and that specifically there would be no\"league tables\". This followed an earlier academic exercise when preparedness plans found on the web were analysed and countries were place in a \"league table\" without validation or informing the countries [24, 25] . Instead in 2006 the ECDC used the then indi-cators to gather country-specific data but did not publish individual country results. Rather normative data were passed back to countries so that they could determine how they compared to other EU/EEA countries. All countries participated in a repeat of the survey using a core of the same indicators in 2007, which allowed the ECDC to determine to what extent countries' preparedness had improved after 12 months of work [32] . Member States were also shown the report for comment before publication and the ECDC made adjustments when suggestions and requests were received. Hence the ECDC was seen as an honest\"broker\". The combined results revealed that much progress was being made while at the same time there were a number of weaknesses especially in the fields of delivering preparedness locally and multi-sectoral work. This led to the development of a standard\"threedimensional\" model of pandemic preparedness [22] . In preparation for an intended repeat survey in 2009 (Member States had asked for a moratorium on surveys in 2008) the EU Health Security Committee (the EU body with oversight of pandemic preparedness) pointed out that if Member States were going to be judged by the indicators they ought to approve them. A process of consultation was undertaken with the HSC Influenza Section members leading to formal publication of the indicators, though not until after the 2009 pandemic [22] .",

            "text": "The 2009 pandemic provided a real test of pandemic preparedness. While there was generally a strong response to a pandemic that itself was almost optimal for Europe [18, 32] it is also agreed that many weakness were revealed and lessons needed to be learnt [17, 33] -perhaps the most important being to prepare for different kinds of pandemics, especially around that elusive parameter\"severity\" [34] . The last European status report on pandemic preparedness in 2007 [30] had concluded that, in spite of the progress found, a further 2-3 years of sustained effort and investment was needed by the EU and its Member States to achieve the level of preparedness needed to respond well to a pandemic. That can now be seen to have been an optimistic estimate. Dealing well with the challenges of any pandemic requires complex adjustments that may be very different from the experiences in other crises. Most problems occurred in stress on hospital intensive care and paediatric services, around risk communication, vaccination, maintaining the confidence of the professionals and delivering local interventions. These cannot be measured with indicators alone and arguably the ECDC\"acid tests\" are the most useful of the indicators on hand ( [27] , . Tab. 5). Consensus on the surveillance difficulties were agreed at a meeting of the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN) in 2010 [34] . These identified difficulties in establishing surveillance in hospitals, undertaking seroepidemiology, estimating severity and sharing of analyses. Finally it is important to appreciate that the 2009 pandemic was unusually benign (it had a low case fatality rate and did not stress essential services outside the health sector) [17, 18, 33] , i.e. countries should not neglect preparations for more severe pandemics. The commitment to visit all 30 EU/ EEA Member States in 2 years placed a considerable strain on the ECDC and its partner organizations. They will not have the capacity to re-visit the countries frequently, and follow-ups have been so far limited to addressing progress in pandemic preparedness during visits for other reasons. Therefore, it remains challenging for the ECDC and partner organizations to assist the Member States over a longer term in keeping the momentum in strengthening preparedness though there is a Council Conclusion to do so which ECDC will support [35] . However countries will need to do more self-monitoring and assessment in the future, supported by the new indicators, and complemented by annual regional meetings for direct communication about their activities, and continued, but less frequent assessment visits. The natural\"kick-off \" for this in Europe was the Belgian EU Presidency meeting in July 2010 and the Council Conclusions though in parallel it is hoped that there will also be a new WHO guidance developed after the 2011 World Health Assembly and the report of the Fineberg Committee [35, 36] .
