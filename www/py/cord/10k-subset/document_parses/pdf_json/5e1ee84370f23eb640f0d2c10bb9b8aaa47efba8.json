Aims: The objective of this research effort was to conduct the first countrywide survey on the status quo of sedation analgesia as delivered to children and adolescents in Germany. Methods: We dispatched letters to all pediatric hospital settings in Germany (n = 305), including a questionnaire that had been developed with existing guidelines taken into account. Its items were designed to elucidate the current practice of PSA throughout these pediatric centers regarding (a) organizational structures and (b) standards of medication and staffing. Results: A total of 138 centers returned the questionnaire, hence the response rate was 45.2%. Numerous centers had implemented adequate structures and staffing standards. Deficits were nevertheless identified, most notably in terms of on-location equipment and staff provided to deliver sedations. Essential items of equipment were not provided in up to 26.8% of centers. Adequate staffing was not provided in up to 44.2% of centers, depending on the diagnostic or interventional procedures for which the PSA was delivered. The most widely used sedative agents were midazolam, ketamine/esketamine, and propofol.

Its reasonable response rate of 45.2% illustrates the importance attributed to this topic. Around 60% of the responding centers delivered at least two sedations per week. While this survey captured merely a snapshot and not a trend, the literature does provide evidence for PSA becoming increasingly common [1] [2] [3] [4] . We agree with recommendations and demands raised in numerous publications that a standardized approach is mandatory [7] [8] [9] . Given the additional provision of adequate on-location equipment and well-qualified staff, patient safety can be ensured and the quality of sedation optimized. Our findings show that specialized sedation teams are established in over 40% of pediatric centers. Thus we have come a long way, but there continues to be room for improvement. Regular training is demonstrably helpful in implementing standardized processes [6] . It is therefore all the more surprising that only around one-third of the responding centers organized such courses recurrently. A need for regular trainings and organizational improvements can also be postulated from other findings: 15.9% of pediatric centers did not ask their patients if they were allergic or intolerant to substances used for PSA, around 20% did not consider airway infections during the pre-sedative period, onefifth did not use a standardized documentation protocol, and one-fourth did not perform follow-up examinations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 492, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 493, "end": 496, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 497, "end": 500, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 501, "end": 504, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 623, "end": 626, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 627, "end": 630, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 631, "end": 634, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1058, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In its latest update on how to deliver safe sedation to children, the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) has pointed out that adverse events and adequate organization are inversely related.

Our results show that many centers are aware of inadequate training being a problem and have implemented risk-adapted rules for sedation. Yet the responses also show that there is considerable room for improvement. What remains generally unanswered is the question just how much training should be required from an anesthesiologist or pediatrician to be considered \"experienced enough\" for safe delivery of a sedation, regardless of its depth [14] . While we have repeatedly reported on the good experience with our own in-house standard [5, 6, 22, 23] , any wholesale extrapolation of this experience and its analysis would be misguided, given that other pediatric centers may have training programs that differ from ours in content and emphasis.
