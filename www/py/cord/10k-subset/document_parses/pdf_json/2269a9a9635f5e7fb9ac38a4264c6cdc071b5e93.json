HFRS is considered to be distinct from hantavirus (cardio-)pulmonary syndrome (HPS or HCPS), described in the New World. Here, we report a severe case, which fulfilled most, if not all, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HPS, needing non-invasive ventilation and subsequent acute hemodialysis. However, the etiological agent was PUUV, as proved by serological testing, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing. Viral antigen was detected by specific anti-PUUV immunostaining, showing, for the first time, greenish intracytoplasmic inclusions in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages. This case definitely confirms that HPS can be encountered during PUUV infections. Interestingly, special findings could render the diagnosis easier, such as greenish homogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions, surrounded by a fine clear halo in BAL macrophages. Therefore, although the diagnosis remains difficult before the onset of renal involvement, the occurrence of severe respiratory failure mimicking community-acquired pneumonia must alert the clinician for possible HPS, especially in endemic areas.",

            "text": "Members of the genus Hantavirus comprise the only nonarthropod-borne viruses in the family Bunyaviridae. Hantaviruses are primarily transmitted by the inhalation of aerosolized viral particles shed by rodents, which serve as chronically infected but asymptomatic reservoirs. Recent overviews [1, 2] have listed up to 42 named hantaviruses, of which at least 20 were described as human pathogens, mostly in the Americas. This is in contradiction, however, with the official standpoint of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) having recognized, so far, only 23 lineages as separate hantavirus species, of which not all are known pathogens [3] . Each hantavirus species is multiplied and spread by a mostly unique rodent species. The most important pathogens are Hantaan virus and Seoul virus in the Far East (>90 % of worldwide infections), Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava-Belgrade virus in Europe and Russia, and, finally, Sin Nombre virus and Andes virus in the Americas [1, 2] Until recently, two clinical syndromes were classically described: hantavirus (cardio-)pulmonary syndrome (HPS or HCPS) described since 1994 in the Americas [4] and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or its milder form nephropathia epidemica (NE), known in Eurasia since the early 1930s. However, a considerable overlap of symptoms was noted from 1994 onwards [5] , and recent evidence has shown yet more pathogenic similarities between the syndromes caused by the two groups of genetically related viruses [3, 6, 7] . The case described herein adds to the mounting evidence that HPS can be seen in Europe, and be caused by PUUV, as reported previously [5, [7] [8] [9] .",

Her general practitioner started ibuprofen (600 mg \u00d73/d), as well as a quinolone (levofloxacin 500 mg/d) 3 days before her hospital admission. She had smoked since her youth (30 pack-years) and her medical history was characterized by mild asthma, fallopian tube ligature, and a subarachnoid hemorrhage treated by endovascular therapy, resulting in complete recovery. Carbamazepine, prescribed to prevent seizures, was her only drug. She lived with her family in Doische, a rural area in the Ardennes, the densely forested South of Belgium, a region highly endemic for NE [10] . She had not traveled recently and had no pets. Her job consisted on delivering newspapers by car or on foot. She also took a stroll through the woods near Doische about 3 weeks before the onset of symptoms.",

The level of atypical lymphocytes seen in New World HPS cases is higher (rarely if ever less than 10 %) than the 1 % observed in our patient [14] . Moreover, and typical for HPS, rather than for classic HFRS, is the initial clinical and radiological presentation with pronounced pulmonary involvement, but without any initial renal injury on admission, as described recently in three severe Swedish NE cases, two of which were fatal [6] . Pulmonary edema secondary to right heart decompensation after overhydration due to oliguria as a suggested mechanism in HFRS [4] could clinically and radiologically be excluded in cases described in Belgium [5, 9] , France [8] , and Sweden [6] , as in this case with normal echocardiography. Other biological markers mainly noted so far in HFRS were also present: marked proteinuria, fasting hypertriglyceridemia contrasting with low levels of total cholesterol, and very low HDL levels [10, 11, 15] . Finally, initial blurred vision due to transient shallowing of the anterior eye chamber is an often overlooked but very specific clinical sign in NE and, to a lesser degree, HFRS cases [1, 10, 15] , but have not been reported so far in HPS cases from the Americas. In the herein described HPS case, PUUV infection was confirmed serologically, and corroborated by positive blood reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, confirming the considerable clinical overlap between the New and Old World syndromes.",

With specific immunostaining, it was possible to prove that these images corresponded to PUUV viral inclusions. PUUV viral RNA was demonstrated by real-time PCR in BAL at day 9 POS in a Swedish NE case [6] , but the detection of viral antigen with immunohistochemistry has been described so far only on autopsy lung specimens [6] .

            "text": "Hantavirus pathological mechanisms are not well understood, especially the reason why some Puumala viruses had a more pronounced renal or pulmonary feature. Since direct viral tissue damage is negligible, a so-called \"cytokine storm\" as an immunopathological response of the human host seems to be of core importance [16] . Recent publications suggested that the increased capillary permeability observed in both HPS and HFRS might be caused by a common immunopathological mechanism, i.e., hantavirus-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, attacking endothelial cells presenting viral antigens on their surfaces [17] . It is also possible that direct viral toxicities or toxicities due to mediators should be considered as well, since T cells apparently cannot be implicated in pathogenesis in an HPS animal model [18] . In conclusion, this case firmly confirms that PUUV is also an etiologic agent of HPS. Additionally, special features could help the diagnosis, such as greenish homogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions, surrounded by a fine clear halo in BAL macrophages. Therefore, diagnosis clinical suspicion of HFRS remains difficult on admission, before the onset of renal function impairment. However, the combination of an episode of fever with blurred vision, early and massive proteinuria as in this patient, followed by severe lung involvement looking like a community-acquired pneumonia, elevated LDH, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia must alert the clinician for a possible hantavirus infection with HPS features, especially in endemic areas.",
