In detail, 7 of 36 SR-patients of trial AML-BFM 2004 relapsed so far. Five of these would nowadays receive more therapy upfront or not be included into the SR group according to more recent BFM practice and international consensus (one with AML1/ETO; one with STAT5B/RARA, three fulfilling previous SR-criteria only by morphology-Auer rod positive-but not by genetics) [1, 10] . Cases with AML1/ETO fusion have been recognized to fare worse by not receiving HAM in study 2004 that intended only four instead of five cycles for SR patients [10] . Patients with FAB M3 and STAT5B/RARA fusion have recently been demonstrated to be resistant to both ATRA and ATO, and to carry a very poor prognosis with conventional therapy [16] . Generally speaking, of the six PML noninvolving variant rearrangements of RARA identified to date to occur with a low frequency, specifically those involving the PLZF and STAT5B as fusion partners confer therapy resistance and need special management probably even including SCT in first CR [16, 20] . According to the recent pediatric AML expert consensus, mere evidence of Auer rods has no longer been considered an independent criterion for inclusion into a SR stratum in the future [1] . Hence, our relapse case observations among formerly considered \"SR\" patients demonstrate the increase of knowledge over the study period as well as the fact that the course of single patients can have a considerable statistical influence in small trials. Outcome differences between the small Austrian cohorts and the much larger German patient series, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution: results in the Austrian BFM 98 patients seemed to be better compared with the entire AML-BFM 98 cohort (5-year-pSU 75 \u00b1 6 vs. 65 \u00b1 2 %, 5-year-pEFS 61 \u00b1 7 vs. 51 \u00b1 2 %), whereas this relation inverted in study 2004 (5- year-pSU 62 \u00b1 6 vs. 74 \u00b1 2 %, 5-year-pEFS 50 \u00b1 6 vs. 55 \u00b1 2 %) [17] . the first independent report summarizing characteristics and outcome of only the Austrian patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 156, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 431, "end": 444, "text": "[4-7, 10, 17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 744, "end": 747, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 748, "end": 750, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 751, "end": 753, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 754, "end": 757, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2191, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2195, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2362, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2544, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2838, "end": 2842, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2846, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3033, "end": 3036, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3655, "end": 3658, "text": "(5-", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3722, "end": 3726, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Importantly, over the years, the diagnostic work-up has improved and recruitment criteria were specified and broadened to achieve a more realistic picture of the variable characteristics as well as the general outcome of children with AML.

In the last study period (AML-BFM 2004), a stable recruitment of approximately 10-12 cases annually was reached and most of those (95 %) could be accepted as fulfilling protocol criteria. Hence, results from the different study periods are not completely comparable as the composition of the cohorts changed over time.

In a similar approach, we piloted alternate-day high-dose intravenous teicoplanin (plus oral ciprofloxacin for patients aged > 5 years) and found a similar reduction of VGS septicemia (manuscript in preparation). This prophylaxis can easily be applied also in an out-patient setting. Serious viral infections and associated deaths have been rarely reported in pediatric AML patients [22, 23] ; however, we observed two cases of death in CR during maintenance therapy caused by fatal EBV-induced hemophagocytosis syndrome. Toxicity besides infectious complications was mainly gastrointestinal (Table 3 ). In contrast to other international AML studies, high-grade cardiotoxicity is very rare, both in the entire BFM cohort and in the Austrian series, and we faced no death caused by cardiac toxicity [22, 28] . To some extent, this may be due to the use of potentially less cardiotoxic anthracyclines [17] , as well as to strategic treatment reductions in good risk patients [4, 10, 29] . Treatment reductions and drug targeting of essential pathways of leukemic pathobiology instead of applying conventional, nonselective chemotherapy may further allow improving cure rates and quality of life. As an example, patients with AML FAB M3 and the typical PML/RARA fusion have an excellent prognosis with current ATRA-based chemotherapy already (20/21 of our patients are in continuous CR-2 following SCT after relapse) [29] . More recent observations with combinations of ATO and ATRA suggest that chemotherapy could even be completely avoided in this subtype [30, 31] .

Major factors of success in this striving are (i) immediate diagnostics and treatment in dedicated and experienced centers only (i.e., limited to five major centers in Austria serving nearly all cases out of a population of approximately 8 million people) and (ii) supportive care aiming at reducing typical comorbidities and fatalities. In fact, the total percentage of study patients who died for any other reasons besides relapse declined over the three studies from 11 % in study 93 to 5 % in trial 2004. In AML-BFM 93 and 98, the respective numbers were comparable with those published for the whole BFM cohort (12 and 9 %, respectively) [21] . Death before start of treatment (n = 6) and early death (n = 3) were almost exclusively caused either by cerebral hemorrhage due to coagulation disturbances as in FAB M3 subtype (n = 2) or to hyperleukocytosis (n = 4; three cases M4/M5), or due to leukostasis with associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is typical for FAB M4/M5 subtypes (n = 2). This was also seen in the whole BFM cohort and other international pediatric AML studies [21] [22] [23] . A high degree of experienced alertness to initial risk of complications, immediate treatment commencement including external cell reduction modalities (e.g., by exchange transfusion) as needed, and specific therapies like ATRA pretreatment in FAB M3 all translate into a reduced death toll [24] . Nevertheless, it needs to be stated that deaths before study consent and treatment initiation are usually not registered in the database of studies that fall under laws and regulations related to the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products. Hence, registration also of such patients and of their presentation (and of other patients not eligible for study inclusion) is an overriding aim for a population-based assessment of the welfare of pediatric patients with AML to work on measures to avert fatal outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 775, "end": 779, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1242, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1549, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Death in first CR (n = 5 in total; only one case in study 2004) should be rare with experienced supportive care.

It is accompanied by long periods of severe neutropenia and immunosuppression with associated invasive bacterial and fungal infections. Related to this, high-grade toxicity in AML-BFM 2004 was particularly caused by infections (between 22 and 31 % following the different chemotherapy courses; Table 3 ). The usage of anti-infective prophylaxis covering Pneumocystis jirovecci, common molds like Aspergillus species, and gram-positive as well as -negative bacteria has, therefore, been recommended [1, 22, 23, 25, 26] . Currently, oral antifungal prophylaxis with either itraconazole suspension (higher bioavailability than capsules) or voriconazol is probably the most cost-effective praxis in children with AML.

Indicating SCT for HR AML by availability of a matched sibling donor-as in study AML-BFM 98-has no proven value overall, but SCT might be beneficial in certain subgroups like those with MLL rearrangements [36] . SCT-related increased morbidity and mortality as compared with conventional intensive chemotherapy needs to be balanced against potentially higher antileukemic efficacy. In that striving for higher cure rates, SCT-in its current forms-is still not a cureall: despite SCT in first CR, five patients relapsed among 14 transplanted (some of the latter have a very short follow-up time). Nevertheless, our data are in line with the notion that performing SCT in first CR in defined highrisk constellations might allow undergoing SCT under better circumstances and with less toxicity accumulations-in contrast to waiting for a relapse and undergoing further toxic chemotherapies as preparation for eventual SCT in second CR. Importantly, according to our data the proportions of patients eventually transplanted-based on both policies-seem to be similar (37-39 % in study 98 and 2004). Upcoming trials will, therefore, reintegrate the idea of transplanting certain high-risk patients already in first CR based on the nowadays more comprehensive picture of genetic aberrations heralding a very poor outcome upon chemotherapy alone [1] . Among those are MLL translocations specifically involving the quite frequently occurring partner genes AF6 (5/5 relapsed; one survived after SCT) and AF10 (6/11 relapsed; short follow-up in two cases after primary SCT), whereas AF9-the most frequently observed translocation partner in pediatric AML-did not confer such very dismal outcome. Our MLL data are in line with recent large-scale case collections, both regarding the very significant overall incidence (23 % among all study patients-38 % of HR patients) and with respect to partner gene distribution as well as related outcome [37] . Hence, MLL-rearranged pediatric HR-AML is probably the most important genetically defined subcohort needing improved and individualized treatment modalities. Most importantly, both the need for and the potential of individualized management are based on sophisticated genetic reference diagnostics.

In total, around 42 % of non-FAB M3 patients with a poor early response achieved a stable CR with their first line of treatment (BFM 93: 0/5; BFM 98: 6/11, 55 %; BFM 2004: 8/17, 47 %).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Results of different study periodsAML acute myeloid leukemia, CCR continued complete remission, CR complete remission, ED early death, NR nonresponse, EFS event-free survival, pSU probability of survival, pEFS probability of event-free survival, SU survival, SE standard error", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Toxicity in acute myeloid leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster 2004", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Induction </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>HAM (HR group) </td><td>AI </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>haM </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>HAE </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Maintenance\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Grade3/4 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Grade3/4 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Grade3/4 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Grade3/4 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Grade3/4 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Grade3/4\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>General condition </td><td>n </td><td>% </td><td>Total </td><td>n </td><td>% </td><td>Total </td><td>n </td><td>% </td><td>Total </td><td>n </td><td>% </td><td>Total </td><td>n </td><td>% </td><td>Total </td><td>n </td><td>% </td><td>Total\n</td></tr><tr><td>12 </td><td>16 </td><td>77 </td><td>9 </td><td>18 </td><td>49 </td><td>9 </td><td>13 </td><td>71 </td><td>5 </td><td>7 </td><td>67 </td><td>5 </td><td>8 </td><td>60 </td><td>2 </td><td>4 </td><td>56\n</td></tr><tr><td>Nausea </td><td>14 </td><td>18 </td><td>76 </td><td>4 </td><td>8 </td><td>49 </td><td>9 </td><td>13 </td><td>71 </td><td>5 </td><td>8 </td><td>65 </td><td>9 </td><td>15 </td><td>60 </td><td>2 </td><td>4 </td><td>56\n</td></tr><tr><td>Diarrhea </td><td>13 </td><td>17 </td><td>77 </td><td>2 </td><td>4 </td><td>49 </td><td>8 </td><td>11 </td><td>71 </td><td>2 </td><td>3 </td><td>66 </td><td>2 </td><td>3 </td><td>60 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>56\n</td></tr><tr><td>Stomatitis </td><td>10 </td><td>13 </td><td>77 </td><td>5 </td><td>10 </td><td>49 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>71 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>65 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>60 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>56\n</td></tr><tr><td>S-GOT/S-GPT </td><td>13 </td><td>17 </td><td>77 </td><td>9 </td><td>18 </td><td>49 </td><td>23 </td><td>33 </td><td>70 </td><td>8 </td><td>12 </td><td>66 </td><td>13 </td><td>22 </td><td>59 </td><td>6 </td><td>11 </td><td>55\n</td></tr><tr><td>Creatinine </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>77 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>49 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>71 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>67 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>58 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>55\n</td></tr><tr><td>Infection </td><td>17 </td><td>22 </td><td>77 </td><td>15 </td><td>31 </td><td>49 </td><td>21 </td><td>30 </td><td>70 </td><td>19 </td><td>29 </td><td>66 </td><td>17 </td><td>30 </td><td>57 </td><td>8 </td><td>15 </td><td>55\n</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiac function </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>77 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>49 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>71 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>65 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>60 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>56\n</td></tr><tr><td>Neurotoxicity </td><td>2 </td><td>3 </td><td>77 </td><td>1 </td><td>2 </td><td>49 </td><td>2 </td><td>3 </td><td>71 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>66 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>59 </td><td>2 </td><td>4 </td><td>56\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors thank all involved clinicians, data managers, nurses, and technicians of the participating hospitals for their most valuable cooperation.
