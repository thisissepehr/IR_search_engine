            "text": "Actin determination in cells requires lysis of cells which is carried out more easily in cell suspensions compared to lysis of cells attached to artificial surfaces. Here we report our data of actin analysis in platelets adhered to plastic and of cultured endothelial cells (ec) . Analysis of the actin pools in platelets and ec was performed using the ONase I inhibition assay. Ouri~g adhesion of platelets to plastic wells (Nunclon , Denmark) a shift in the G-/F-actin equilibrium occured. An increase of 22.0 + 6.7~ (n = 5) F-actin was found compared to control washed platelets. This increase during adhesion is moderate in comparison to that found during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Ec from human umbilical veins were cultured on gelatin-coated p~astic dishes. Ihey contain 12.9 + 2.3 /ug actin/lO ec (n : iO), 57.4 + 9.1% were found to be G-actin and 42.6 + 9.1% F-actin. For one single determination ~ne petri dish (90 mm diameter) with about 4.5 x lO ec was necessary. Whereas lysed ec were scraped off for actin determination from the dish and transferred into Eppendorf tubes, actin analysis in platelets was quantitatively only after depolymerization of the filaments on the surface, indicating that filaments stick tightly to the plastic. Aotin exists in platelets in two main forms, the monomer or G-aotin and the filamentous polymeric form, F-actin. The equilibrium of G-to F-astin in resting platelets is maintained at a constant ratio, but upon stimulation G-actin can readily polymerize to form filaments. After irreversible aggregation induced by AOP, collagen, adrenaline, arachidonic acid, PAF or thrombin, a significant increase in F-actin was found (30-50~ more cellular F-actin compared to controls). Actin polymerization is a very fast process reaching a significant level already with shape change and well before aggregation commenced or release of serotonio was signilicant. During reversible aggregation the degree of actin polymerization is smaller and at the end of deaggregation the F-actin level nearly returned to values found in unstimulated platelets. A 23187 or ionomycin also induce actin polymerization, but the degree is smaller (12-25~ more cellular F-a~$in compared to controls). The increase in cytosolic Ca ~ induced by the ionophores precedes the actin polymerization. EDTA inhibits partially ADP-or collagen-induced actin polymerization. From both results and the finding that phorbol ester (O.B/uM PMA) leads to an increase of about l~ F-actin in pl@telets we conclude tentatively Z+ that Ca and proteinkinase C seem to be involved at least in part into the initial actin assembly process in platelets. Platelet functions in a 63 years old woman with autoantibodies against the GP IIb-IIIa complex (see A. Schirmer et al., part l) were severely impaired. Aggregation could not be induced by AOP and collagen, thrombin caused only a weak aggregation. Agglutination by ristocetin as well as adhesion were also defective. Patient's serum (i-5~ final concentration) inhibits thrombin-or collageninduced aggregation of normal platelets, q Patient's platelets contain only 473/ug actin/lO ~ platelets and an extremely low F-actin value (3Q of total platelet actin). Stimulation of these platelets with 0.i U/ml thrombin for 3 min and measurement of the G-/Factin equilibrium resulted in an increase of only 5% F-actin, whereas ADP and collagen did not induce any actin polymerization. Addition of patient's serum to normal platelets leads to an inhibition of thrombin-induced actin polymerization. Both effects of patient's serum on normal platelets (inhibition of aggregation and actin polymerization) points to receptor blockade by platelet autoantibodies found in th%patient's serum. Ca ~ movement in the patient's platelets is severely impaired after AOP or collagen stimulation whereas a normal Ca movement was induced by O.l U/ml thrombin. How-Z+ ever, normal Ca movement by thrombin but inhibited actin polymerization by this agonist does not necessarily+point to an independence of actin polymerization from Ca ~ ions, but emphasizes the receptor-mediation for actin polymerization. Classical hereditary thrombocytopathies (Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, Bernard-Sculler syndrome) are caused by deficiencies of certain platelet membrane glycoproteins (GPs). He report on patients from three families with excessive bleeding. Bleeding time was prolonged or at the upper normal limit. Patients exhibited variable degrees of defective platelet aggregation: either a complete lack of response with ADP and collagen or a decreased aggregation with desaggregation. Platelet GPs were analysed by one-and two-dimensional electrophoresis, lectin-and immunoblotting, and immunoelectrophoretic techniques. In one family the patients' platelets showing decreased aggregability in response to AOP contain only 25 -50 of GP IIb-IIIa complex. In addition, the complex migrated with an altered mobility in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. In a second family a structural abnormality of the GP IIb-IIIa complex is suggested dy the finning that platelets although containing 40 -60 ~ of the normai amount of GP IIb-IIIa complex show a complete lack of aggregation. In the third family the patient's platelets contain an abnormal GP idemtifieo as a variant of GP Ib. This variant is different from the polymorphic GP Ib forms reported so far.",

The fluorescent dye thiazole orange (TO) is characterized by a large fluorescence enhancement and high quantum yield upon binding to nucleic acids, particularly RNA. In addition, the dye readily permeates live cell membranes. Whole blood samples from hematologically normal subjects and from patients with quantitative platelet disorders were stained with thiazole orange and the platelet populations were analyzed by flow eytometry. The mean percentage (+ SD) of TO-positive platelets in 50 control subjects was 8.6 + 2.8 %. In 21 thrombocytopenic patients whose bone marrow contained normal or increased numbers of megekaryooytes, the percentage of TO-positive platelets was significantly elevated to 26.9 + 10.9 % (p < 0.0001). In contrast, the percentage of positively stained platelets in 23 patients with thrombocytopenza due to underproduction of platelets did not significantly differ from controls (7.1 ~ 3,2 %). Both the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay in differentiating between these two categories of thrombocytopenia was > 95 %. In patients with thrombocythemza/thrombocytosis (n = 13), the percentage of TO-positive plateleta averaged 7.2 + 2.9 %. We conclude, that flow cytometrlc analysis of platelets after staining with TO is a sensitive and spec\u00b1fic test that rapidly prov].des information on the adequacy of platelet production and, thus, on the mechanism of thrombocytopenza. of North Carolina at Chapel Hi I I ; and M uni ci pal Hospi t al Fel dki r ch, Aust r i a Factor X(FX) \"Vorarlberg\" is acongenital CRM+ FX deficiency characterized clinically by a mild bleeding ten den cy.

Blood/plasma samples were drawn from the donor before, during and after the separation run as well as from the used device during the separation and from the collected plasma. Thrombin-antithrombin-oomplexes and the fibdn(ogen)-derivatNes, soluble fibrin and flbrinopeptid A, proved to be sensitive indicators of a slight activation of the coagulation system. This activation was less pronounced by separation through cantrifugation than through filtration; however, even the filtration devices activated the coagulation system tess than common bag centrifugatlon. Furthermore, a decrease in blood coagulation factors and inhibitors were most pronounced using bag centrifugation. The number of cells remaining in the collected plasma was highest after separation by centrifugation alone, whereas less than 1/10 as many were seen using filtration methods. Considering the fact that presently most of the dally transfused fresh frozen plasma Is collected by centrlfugatlon of blood bags, the comparatively slight activation of blood coagulation by plasma separation machines seems to be negligible. However, the number of remaining cells in the collected plasma may be of greater interest: a total elimination of cells from transfused plasma should be the goal to avoid activation of blood coagulation in recipients.",

D. vonder Ahe, Y. Nagamine--and G. MOIler-Berghaus The genes coding for the two plasminogen activators urokinasetype (uPA) and tissue-type (tPA) have been identified. They are located on different chromosomes. Both genes are organized with separate exons. The homology between the two PAs at the amino acid level is only 40%, but the enzymes are highly similar in their basic structures, which demonstrates a close evolutionary relationship, uPA is implicated in various aspects of cellular functions such as fibrinolysis, cell migration, tissue reorganization during morphogenesis and invasive growth in both normal and pathological conditions linked to increased plasmin activity, uPA synthesis is modulated by a variety of effector molecules such as phorbol esters, growth factors, peptide and steroid hormones retinoids and others. The regulation of uPA synthesis occurs mainly at the level of gene transcription. To elucidate the mechanisms of regulation, we studied the human and pig uPA gene including their putative regulatory 5'flanking regions. For this purpose, we constructed a series of hybrid genes with uPA-5'-flanking deletion mutants and the E. coil chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase as a reporter gene. Using gene transfer techniques, this hybrid gene was stably integrated in the host cell genome and the activity of the reporter gene measured. This analysis revealed that sequences proximal to the transcription start site as well as sequences far upstream play an important rol e in hormonal regulation through the protein kinaee A pathway and by phorbol esters using the protein kinase C pathway. Furthermore, we identified the protein-binding sequences within the regulatory regions by DNAase I footprint and gel band shift analysis. A comparison of regulatory sequences of human and pig uPA genes will be discussed.",

A series of in v i t r o assays including aPTT, TT, heptest, anti Xa and anti l l a assays using chromogenic substrates were performed in both human and rat platelet poor plasma. All agents inhibited thrombus formation in venules at minimal effective doses from 0.01 to 5 mg/kg 30 min after a single i . v . injection. The dose-dependent antithrombotic effect was not p o s i t i v e l y correlated with the inhibition of F. lla or F. Xa in human or rat plasma. These data suggest that i n h i b i t i o n of thrombosis at the endothelial surface does not d i r e c t l y correlate with current ex vivo coagulation assays. Higher doses were required to observe antithrombotic effects after subcutaneous injections and their duration lasted far longer after s.c. administration than after i . v . injection.

Patscheke. Cell suspensions containing human washed platelets (2 x 108/ml) and human PMNLs (2 x 106/ml) were stimulated with the platelet agonists thrombin 0.06 IU/ml, U 46619 1 pM, or ADP 10 pM. Platelet aggregation and the luminolenhanced chemiluminescence (CL) of the PMNLs were simultaneously monitored in a Lumiaggregometer. Thrombin and U 46619 were able to trigger the platelet aggregation and the CL in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen, whereas ADP required the presence of added fibrinogen to aggregate aspirin-treated platelets and to induce the CL. EDTA and no stirring suppressed the platelet aggregation and the CL in the mixed suspensions. Interference and electron microscopy revealed mixed platelet-PMNL aggregates. Cell-bound fibrinogen was localized by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. It was found in the contacts between platelets, between platelets and PMNLs, at the free surfaces of both cell species and in the platelet C-granules. Neither thrombin, U 46619 and ADP nor the supernatant or a filtrate of thrombin-stimulated platelets induced any CL in pure PMNL suspensions. In asplrin-treated whole blood, U 46619 4 IJM or ADP 10 pM also led to an aggregation as measured by the impedance method and to a strong CL. The CL and the aggregation were again suppressed by EDTA, no stirring and RGD peptides. In contrast, ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination was not associated with CL. It is concluded that the platelet-dependent activation of PMNLs requires a close intercellular contact that is mediated by fibrinogen-binding to the surfaces of both cell species.

The question arises wether, more frequently than known so far DIC in this cases must be attributed to an inborn ipclination to thrombosis due for example to protein C or AT Ill deficiency. To evaluate the possible interactions between phenprocoumon and either metoclopramide or cisapride the following open crossover trial was carried out: 24 healthy volunteers were given 0.22 mg/kg phenprocoumon as a single oral dose on day 4 of a 10 day lasting metoclopramide or cisapride administration and, after a washout period of 4 weeks, alone without those drugs. Several coagulation parameters (prothrombin tlme, factor X-and factor VII-activity, protein C activity and protein C antigen) and the plasma levels of phenprocoumon were determined at certain intervals up to 7 days after administration. Metoclopramide decreased the area under the curve (AUC) (about I6%) and the halflife of phenprocoumon (from 132 to 111 hours), but did not alter peak concentration or the time to peak concentration. Cisapride had no effect on the pharmacocinetics of phenprocoumon. These findings fit for an increase in the elimination of phenprocoumon through metoclopramide. Except for a significant decrease in factor X activity between 2 and 36 hours after phenprocoumon intake during metoclopramide coadministration there were no significant changes in the coagulation parameters through coadministration of eisapride or metoclopramide. As the pharmacokinetlc and the coagulation parameters varied to a large extent intra-and interindividually we conclude that both drugs should be used with caution in combination with phenprocoumon. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) produced by recombinant DNA technology in eucaryotic ceils is well known as a thrombolytic agent. Recombinant t-PA produced in E. coli and renatured tacks carbohydrate moieties in contrast to t-PA produced in eucaryotic cells. The aim of our studies was to investigate if there were differences between recombinant tissue-type piasmlnogen activator (rt-PA) derived from eucaryotic cells (Aiteplase, Thomae GmbH, glberach, FRG) and rt-PA from E.coli (BM 06.021) regarding their pharmacoklnetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. Rabbits were infused with 200 OOO lU/kg b.w. of DM 06.021 or Altepiase for 30 minutes. Plasma samples were assayed for t-PA-activity by a spectrophotometric method with ChromozymRpL. In comparison with AIteplase (n=6), BM 06.021 (n=5) showed an about three-fold longer initial half-life (2.1+_0.6vs.5.6\u00b12.6 mln, mean+-So) a three-fold slower plasma clearance (22.2\u00b17.6vs. 7.5+1.7 ml \u2022 min -1 \u2022 kg -1) and a three-fold increased area under the curve (133+_44 vs. 452+_105 IU \u2022 m1-1 \" min). In a rabbit model of jugular vein thrombosis, BM 06.021 or Atteptase was infused for 4 hours at at least 3 dose levels. The specific activity of RM 06.021 was comparable with that of Alteplase. The analysis of the dose-response curves showed that BM 06.021 has a two-fold increase in thrombotytlc potency (ED~ 0.26 mg/kg b.w. vs. 0.55 mg/kg b.w.). At equieffective doses there were no statistically significant differences either in the plasma levels of t-PA-activity, fibrinogen, plasminogen or alpha~antiplasmln between BM 06.021 and Alteplase at the end of the experiments or in the hemodynamics during the infusion of the two agents.",

Patients with coronary heart disease undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery represent a well-studied group in which changes of a number of hematological, mostly platelet parameters have been described. New electronic cell counting and sizing techniques in hematology enable us to analyze most of these partially uncommon parameters such as mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet volume distribution width (PDW) and RBC-distribution width (RDW) on a fast scale.

The data were correlated with clinical severity of preeclampsia. We found no consistent changes of vWF in association with thrombocytopenia of clinical severity of preeclampsia. However, the ratio of vWF:RiCof/vWF:Ag was lower in postpartum samples of mild (p<0.03) and severe (p<0.007) preeclamptics as compared to the controls. A mild form of disseminated intravascular coagulation with elevated FSP titers and thrombocytopenia was evident in severe preeclamptics. Two preeclamptic patients, who developed severe intrapartum hemorrhage showed decreased HMW forms of vWF multimers postpartum. The alteration of multimers did not correlate with the severity of preeclampsia nor with thrombopenia. Since low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used for prevention of thromboembolism, the coagulation laboratories are in need of a practicable test, sensitive to factor Xa-inhibition, for monitoring the effect of LMWH in plasma.Effects of subcutaneous administration of 20 mg and 40 mg of Enoxaparin were studied in blood samples drawn from 20 patients before and 1,2,3,4,6,12 and 24 hours after injection, measuring thrombin time, APTT, Heptest and anti-Xa activity (amidolytic assay). Subcutaneous administration of 20 mg Enoxaparin had no effect on APTT, and was followed by a bar17 significant (p<0.05) rise of thrombin time 4 hours after injection. There was a barly significant (p<0.05) increase of APTT and thrombin time four hours after application of 40 mg.Heptest and amidolytic assay (S-2222) correlated well and there was a significant (p<0.01) increase of values with a maximum at 4 hours after administration of 20 mg or 40 mg Enoxaparin. Compared with values measured after treatment with 20 mg, higher values could be achieved after administrab ion of 40 mg.We concluded that the Heptest, which can be performed easily and quickly, correlates well with the chromogenic reference method. Therefore, it could be utilized in monitoring the effect of Enoxaparin in plasma samples of patients treated with this drug. Results of internal and external evaluations Electra 900c is a new automated instrument designed to perform all relevant functional assays of a haemostasis laboratory. All clotting assays and chromogenic substrate assays can be performed. In the PT assay simultaneously a fibrinogen determination is performed by measuring the increase of absorbance during clot formation (derived fibrinogen). The performance of the derived fibrinogen was evaluated on 237 patient samples which were analyzed in different laboratories. The correlation between the derived fibrinogen and the Clauss assay was excellent with the correlation coefficient of r -0,96. Both assays give approximately the same information on the amount of clottable fibrinogen which is reflected by the equation of the regression line (Passing/Bablok) y = 0,95 x + 19,5. PT-assays correlated well with results determined on mechanical instruments of centrifugal analyzers. Typical in run precision were between 0,6 and 3 % C.v. for several parameters including PT, aPTT, fibrinoqen (Clauss), AT III and Factor VlII. Also the precision from day to day was in a similar range.

With Electra 900/1000 the same degree of precision as in clinical chemistry can be achieved. Therefore a further step into standardization and improvement of precision and accuracy in haemostasis assays is possible. Tissue Factor (thromboplastin) expression in vascular cells or release of cells into the circulation trigger the initiation of coagulation in the vasculature by allowing the formation of proteolytically active Tissue Factor:factor VII (TF:VlIa) complexes. In vitro studies demonstrated the potency of LPS to induce TF expression in endothelial cells and monocytes and suggest a critical role of this effector molecule in the pathogenesls of disseminated intravas~ular coagulation associated with septic shock. The lethality of E. cell induced septic shock in baboons is prevented by infusion of anti TF monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) prior to E. cell challenge demonstrating pathophysiological significance of TF expression in the vasculature. We investigated the mechanism by which MAbs against TF interfere with TF cofactor function. Most MAhs recognized factor VII interactive regions on TF and demonstrated inhibition of TF function by occupying the factor VII binding sites. Incubating TF with these MAbs abolished cofactor function completely as determined in clotting assays. Preformed TF:VIIa complexes were not inhibited by these MAbs, a finding which was expected from the slow dissociation of the TF:VIIa complex. The disadvantage of the inhibitory profile of these MAbs for therapeutical interventions during intravascular coagulation is evident. Two MAbs raised in our laboratory showed a inhibitory profile distinct from all other MAbs. These MAbs not only bind to TF:VIIa complex but also block TF:VIIa function as efficiently as free TF cofactor function. These MAbs appear to represent potential therapeutical agents which are able to inhibit ongoing initiation by TF:VIIa during disseminated intravascular coagulation. The accumulation of high molecular weight molecules induced an increase of plasma viscosity and a reduction predominantely of the factor VIII complex. Patients suffering from cerebrovascular disease were treated with 500 to 1000 ml of three different s~lutions of HES over 10 days. They received 10% Eloh~st ~ 200/0,62 (n:lO) or one of two different sol~tions of 10% HES 200/0,5 (HAES-sterilR; n=10; Haemofusin-; n=10) which differ in the mode of hydroxylat~on. Only the HAES-steril-decreased the plasma viscosity, induced no accumulation of high molecular weight starch molecules in the plasma and did not alter significantly clotting factors. In contrast the two other HES solutions increased plasma viscosity due to an accumulation of high molecular weight starch molecules and decreased progressively and significantly factor VIII:C, Vlll~g and VIII:RCF. In conclusion not only the degree but also the mode of hydroxylation of starch might be responsible for the accumulation of high molecular weight starch molecules. These molecules seemed to induce the different haemorheological and haemostaseologic effects and especially the reduction of factor VIII activities which was much higher than the hemodilution effect. The degree of the reversible factor VIII reduction, which corresponded with a drug induced yon Willebrand's disease, depended on the dosage and the duration of the HES infusions. (2388 Dalton). This material was tested in an experimental thrombosis model, in which rat mesentetic venules (diameter 25-30 Nm) were injuried by well defined Argon laser lesions.

I f lactobionic acid was added to citrate-PRP ADPand collagen-induced aggregation were inhibited with I00 Ng/ml PRP while epinephrine-induced aggregation was reduced at concentrations of 500 Ng/ml PRP. The effects of LW 10082 on epinephrine-induced aggregation and the inhibition of platelet adhes.ion to siliconised glass are similar to those observed with d i f f e r e n t low molecular weight heparins, but d i f f e r d i s t i n c t l y from the effects of UFH. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) possess d i f f e r e n t anticoagulant properties compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH). Their capacity to i n h i b i t thrombin is reduced but they show higher anti Xa a c t i v i t y . In the present study 3 LMW heparins (CY 216, Choay, Paris); Kabi 2165 (Kabi Vitrum, Stockholm), LMW heparin (Sandoz, NUrnberg) and I UFH (Liquemin, Hoffmann-La Roche, Grenzach) were compared with the 4th Int. Standard (IS) for UFH and the WHO Standard (WS) for LMWH. Anti Xa, anti l l a and APTT-assays were performed using an automated centrifugal analyzer (ACL 300, IL). In the anti Xa assays Liquemin, the 4th IS for UFH and CY 216 were less active than Fragmin and Sandoz neu and the WS for LMWH more d i s t i n c t differences were found in the low dose range (0-0.2 U/ml ). As expected Liquemin and the 4th IS for UFH had the highest anti l l a -a c t i v i t y , while Fraxiparin showed the lowest thrombin-inhibition. The other LMWH including :he standard for LMWH exhibited moderate anti l l a a c t i v i t y . The heparin-sensitivity of 4 APTT-assays'(PTT-D, IL; Actin FS, Merz + Dade; Neothromtin, Behring; PTTa, Boehringer) differed with Neothromtin and Actin FS being the most sens i t i v e reagents. Marked differences between UFH and LMWH were only detected in the high dose (0.25-1.0 U/ml). The heptest was sensitive to all investigated heparins. The d i f f e r e n t heparins show d i f f e r e n t a c t i v i t i e s depending on the assay by which they are monitored. The introduction of an international standard for LMWH can only partly solve this problem. Prospectively (10/86-9/89) 125 patients with liver cirrhosis of different etiologies sod episodes of portal and functional deconpensation were repeatedly investigated to assess the importances of disturbance of helestasis and liver function. Methods: TPZ, fibrinoqen, clotting factors If, V, VII, VIII, intithro~bin III (AT Ill), Protein C, platelets, Cholinestsrase (~E), Alb~lin, Billrubin, Indocyanina-tl/2 (ICG), Galactose elimination capacity (GEC), ascites, esophageal verices, bleeding events, Child-l~o~-classificatiun and life tables were analysed. Results: 45 patients (36%) died within study period (Child A:18%, Child B: 27%, Child C: 71%). Of patients with I~-tl/2 <20 |in mertslity rate was 35% compared to 65% in patients with ICG tl/2 >20 nin. Coa@datery and inhibitory factors of hemestasis (TPZ : AT Ill, factor VII : protein C ) correlated positively ( r _< 0.7) A new balance of hemestasis results. Also parameters of bemostasis and liver function correlated in different phases of portal and functional decolpensation. Bleeding events followed portal hypertension and were indepeedunt of parameters of hemestesis. Prolongation of ICG tl/2 is an indirect parameter of portal shunt flow. Probabillity of bleeding evunts is si<p~ificantly hi~P.r in patients with ICG tl/2 >30 lin colpared with ICG tl/2 <20 nin.Osing a score of TPZ and AT III <40% aim factor VlI <30% pro(]mesis is very bad (*liver failure).

            "text": "Initiation of coagulation on cell surfaces is triggered by Tissue Factor (TF) an integral membrane protein with a wide tissue distribution. TF serves as a receptor for factor VII/VIIa forming a catalytic TF:VlIa bimolecular complex. We attempted to define the functional regions in TF using moneelonal antibodies (FLAbs) as probes for the surface of the TF protein. MAbs were shown to be specific for factor VII interactive regions by functional characterization of their inhibition pattern and by competition studies with factor VII. The recognition sites on TF were characterized by Western-blot analysis of MAb reactivity with proteolytic fragments of TF and with carboxy terminal deletion mutants of TF produced in a prokaryaotie expression system. One group of MAbs did not react with proteolytic fragments of TF and reacted with a deletion mutant spanning amino acids 1-157. No reactivity with shorter mutants was observed suggesting that the interaetlve region of the MAbs is located in exon 5 or requires this part of the molecule for proper folding. A second group of MAbs was shown to react with proteolytic fragments which bound anti peptide antibodies to amino terminal sequences of TF. These MAhs reacted with a deletion mutant spanning amino acid 1-83 but not with shorter mutants. These data therefore implicate the amino terminal half of the TF extracellular domain in factor VII binding. Site directed mutagenesis and peptidyl mimicry will help to define key amino acids in the factor VII interactive region. Since pre-kinins and their inhibitors under the administration of heparin fragments have not been very much taken into account until now, comparative investigations with high molecular heparin (HMW) will contribute to learn more about them. The clinical relevance is going to be discussed in this context and investigated with the help of the activators prekallikrein, of the kallikrein-like-activity, of the functional kallikrein-inhibition and @-factor XIIa-inhibition before the chirurgical intervention and on the third and seventh postoperative days. The investigation was carried out on 122 patients who had to be submitted to different elective abdominal surgical operations. 60 patients were treated with standard-heparin (HMW); 62 with LMW-heparin. In patients after abdominal surgical interventions, a compensed activation of the contact phase was to be noted. This could be proved by a remarguable PKK d~crease which however was not combined with a more intensive kallikrein-like-activity. The mecanisms of compensation could be ascribed to higher levels of the capacity of inhibition by kallikrein and ~-factor XIIa. The release of PMN-elastase can be followed in plasma with the elastase alphal-proteinase inhibitor complex. Two series of-recirculations with heparinized whole blood in a HLM-system were done. The testing-length was each time 120 minutes; blood was taken at nine defined sample times. In another series 1500 plasma units of the Cl-esterase-inhibitor was each time before the recirculation added to the filling volume of the HLM. The concentration of elastase revealed a steady increase up to an end value which exceeded after two hours the initial value by twenty times. Compared with the control group, the application of CI-INH did not lead to a significant inhibition of elastase. Despite a significant increase of the inhibition of kallikrein and ~-factor XIIa no effects on the activation of the contact phase could be established. The reactions of the coagulation system and of complement system were ivestigated ex vivo in a closed HLM modell. Testing time was over 90 minutes. In order to stop the coagulation of blood efficiently, 6 IU/ml of CY-216 (Fraxiparin) had to be administrated. This is, despite a higher anti-FXa-activity, equivalent to twice the dosage of KABI 2156 (Fragmin). Possible explanations for this are: first, an inactivation ++ caused by the bond to Ca -ions; second, a slight affinity of heparin with ATIII. During the course of recirculation the concentration of heparin steadily decreased. This was mainly caused by the inactivation of heparin by platelet factor 4, combined with a significant decrease of the number of thrombocytes. A comparison of CY-216 and KABI 2156 shows that CY-216 is less bonded to platelet factor 4 and also less neutralized by platelet factor 4; on a larger scale, the aggregation of thrombocytes undergoes an inhibition. This reaction could have a positive effekt on the daily dosage, but a negative one on the arising of hemorrhage complications. At the beginning of the test, a confused activation of coagulation occurs intrinsically and extrinsically. This can be established mainly by the decrease of factor XII and Cl-inhibitor activities, as well as by the increase of the activity of factor X. Coagulation is caused by the release of specific proteins by the thrombocytes. As a result of this study, it is to be noted that CY-216 is absolutely capable to stop efficiently the coagulation, but also that crucial differences with the LMW-heparin KABI 2156 do exist. Chir.

The single parameters obtained by varying the aprotinin dosages during the administration of HMW-heparin (150 and 300 KIU/ml), as well as during the administration of varying molecular weight heparin preparations were statistically compared with those obtained by the administration of constant doses of aprotinin. The prekallikrein activity was not effectively inhibited by HMW and I24W-heparin, whereas with a low dosage of aprotinin (150 KIU/ml) it is extremely effectively inhibited and with a high dosage it.is completely inhibited. The kallikrein-like-activity curve confirms these findings independ4nt of the molecular weight. The kallikrein formation was increasingly reduced with increasing doses of proteinase inhibitor; however, a total prevention could not be attained. In the present study a consumption of kallikrein inhibitors, independent of the aprotinin dosage and the heparin administered cannot be demonstrated. One can, therefore, proceed on the assumption that the activity of the physiological kallikrein inhibitors -mostly Cl-esterase inhibitor -decreases in corresponding proportion to the decrease in the @-factor XIIa-inhibition activity. A higher aprotinin dosage as compared to a lower dosage revealed only a slight fall in the ~-factor XIIa-inhibition activity. Chir. Univ. Klinik, 7400 T~bingen, Calwerstr. 7",

            "text": "Because of the positive effects of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin in the field of heart surgery, this study was concerned with Cl-esterase inhibitor which is probably the most efficient inhibitor in the contact activation phase of the coagulation. The investigation was carried out in an ex-vivo model. Anti-coagulant CY 216 (Fraxiparin) was used at a dosage 4 IU/ml. In a initial experiment, Cl-inhibitor was dosed at i000 U/500-700 ml. The extra corporal circulation was kept up at over 120 minutes. The determined parameters at each sample time were co~ pared to the respective results of the runs without Cl-esterase inhibitor, but with the same dosage of heparin. During the filling of stored blood into the reservoir of the HLM, a contact activation of the coagulation and of the prekallikrein-kallikrein-kinin systems was to be noted, produced by the intensified contact with artificial surfaces, and in spite of heparinisation. After the addition of Cl-eWterase inhibitor, further increasing coagulation processes were measured despite significantly increased activity values of ~-factor XIIa-inhibition and Cl-esterase inhibitor. The prekallikrein-kallikrein-kinin system showed as well a further act~ vation. The heparin activity decreased during the circulation. The proteolytical processes of the contact activation phase, as well as the activation of the prekallikrein-kallikrein-kinin system could not be suffiently inhibited. Chir. Univ. Klinik, 7400 Tiibingen, Calwerstr. 7 In the present study, low respectively high molecular heparin was administered to patients during and after abdominal chirurgical interventions. In this process, low molecular heparin appeared to be slightly superior with regard to the emergence of thromboembolism complications. In order to check the effectiveness of the different heparins, patients were not only clinically observed; before and after the operation, relevant parameters concerning the coagulation were analyzed. Blood samples were taken on the first preoperative day, and on the seventh postoperative day. Besides the determination of the activity the inhibitor ATIII, the factor XII-levels and the capacity of inhibition of Cl-esterase inhibitor were measured. The results did not point at any difference between low respectively high molecular heparin. In almost every case, a reduction of the activity of ATIII was confirmed in the postoperative period. In patients with big abdominal operdtions a more important decrease of this activity was to be noted. The factor XII-levels reacted similarly. Since -as our results reveale -factor XII has an important part to play in the fibrinolysis, both the consumption of inhibitor ATIII and the reduction of factor XII could be responsible for the greater incidence of thromboembolism complications in big abdominal chirurgical interventions. The only difference we could find out at the comparison of both groups was in the remaining activities of heparin before the morning subcutaneous application: patients with low molecular heparin indicated then clearly higher prime activities. chit. Univ. Klinik, 7400 T~bingen, Calwerstr. 7 The release of PMN-elastase can be followed in plasma with the elastase alphal-proteinase inhibitor complex. Two series of recirculations with heparinized whole blood in a HLM-system were done. The testing-length was each time 120 minutes; blood was taken at nine defined sample times. In another series 1500 plasma units of the Cl-esterase-inhibitor was each time before the recirculation added to the filling volume of the HLM. The concentration of elastase revealed a steady increase up to an end value which exceeded after two hours the initial value by twenty times. Compared with the control group, the application of CI-INH did not lead to a significant inhibition of elastase. Despite a significant increase of the inhibition of kallikrein and @-factor XIIa nQ effects on the activation of the contact phase could he established. Slightly reduced plasma levels of prekallikrein, as well as a clear increase of the kallikrein-like-activity, reveal an activation of the plasmakallikrein system at the very beginning of the experiment. Other results show a start of the endogene coagulation and a slight activation of the complement cascade. That is why the place value of the activated Hageman-factor, plasmakallikrein and anaphylatoxins C5, respectively C3a, is of secondary importance in the series of experiments. The similarly increasing runs of the concentration of platelet factor 4 and PMN-elastase show that Pf 4 has intensified the release of elastase from thrombocytes. At the end of the experiment we found reduced heparin levels. Chir. Univ. Klinik, 7400 T~binqen. Calwerstr. 7",

There should be screening tests which can be performed during day and night without special knowledge. The quantitative measurements of fibrino-peptide A, thrombin-AT lll-complex and other substances, which arise through coagulation, may give reasonable informalions of the beginning of DIC, but such assays are time consuming or they need special knowledge or special equipment. Semiquantitative latex-agglutination tests can be done by every lab assistant. Therefore we initiated the semiquantitative determination of fibrin(ogen) degration products (FDP) or of a neoantigen (D-D) in all patients on an intensive care unit, who were thought to have early DIC by the physician on duty. We present a retrospective analysis of the data from 300 patients. About 2/3 show elevated FDP or D-D. The results of these screening tests are compared a) with the results of other coagulation tests performed often (PTZ, fibrinogen, AT III, platelets), b) with the results of lab screening for organ failure (creatine, P%, 3/GT, leucocytes) and c) with some clinical paramet@rs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, main diagnosis). The comparisons show that in patients, who have no bleeding or other positive signs of DIC, no relations exist between FDP or D-D value and other coagulation tests. But even in these patients there is a relation between FDP or D-D and the results of the lab screening for organ failure. High temperature and/or the combination of low blood pressure and high heart rate lasting longer than 4 h are associated with high FDP or D-D respectively.",

P1atelet function assays should be designed in such a way that they can be performed in normal clinical labs without special knowledge. They should enable direct data comparisons of the different labs. We present a standardized measurement of collagen and ADP induced ptatelet aggregation with the help of a personal computer. The measuring data are registered on line, laid out graphically and calculated in accordance with suitable points given. The dose effect relationships between aggregants (6 different concentrations) and calculated parameters (5 after ABP induction, 4 after collagen induction) are demonstrated (n = 40). The comparison of the results of this normal group with those of 8 volunteers 24 hours after they had taken 250 mg ASS and of 5 patients respectively with typical illnesses associated with type-and hyperaggregability, shows that the analysts of the aggregation with 2 reagent-concentrations respectively (1.2 and 4 #g/ml collagen; 1.2 and 4 pHol/ml ADP) and the resulting calculation parameters can differ between normal, type-and hyper-aggregable platelets, We believe that the presented standardized and simplified platelet aggregation meas[:rements are suitable for multi centre trials.

The interaction of heparins of varying moleca:lar weight has been investigated in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, antifactor IIa and Xa tests and a whole blood coagulation system. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and 5 low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) were added to increasing doses of protamine in vitro. The heparin-protamine complex was sedimentated by centrifugation. The supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Fractions from HPLC were collected and aXa and alia activities were measured using commercial assays. The data show that UFH and all LMWH's were quantitatively bound by protamine. 1 mg protamine totally bound i mg of all heparins. No aXa or alIa activity was detected in the eluates from the HPLC column. We also examined the neutralization of UFH and the LMWH Kabi 2165 by protamine after intravenous injection of both substances in man on an ex vivo whole blood clotting test. The results show that the effect of protamine on aPT/and thrombin time is completely inhibited by protamine although the coagulation of whole blood was still impaired. There was no difference in the prolongation of coagulation using UFH and LMWH. Clotting of whole blood was monitored in serial subsamples with measurement of FpA and PF4. No relation between FpA and PF4-values and antifactor Xa activity was found. The data demonstrate that protamine binds UFH and all LMWH preparations. After administration into man UFH and LMWH both are bound by protamine. However, some anticoagulant activitiy can still be detected after administration of protamine. This suggests that UFH and LMWH cause release of heparin-like compounds into the blood stream which do not react with pmtamine. Four groups of patients received prophylaxis of thromboembolism because of prior venous thromboembolism (n=51), artificial heart valve replacement (n=13), atrial fibrillation with arterial embolism (n=l 1) and cardiomyopathy (n=ll). They received the LMWH Kabi 2165 in a dose ranging from 2500 to 15.000 aXa units 1 x daily s.c. The dose was adjusted according to the bodyweight and the statistical risk of developing thromboembolism. The treatment period ranged from 1 to 48 months. Occurrence of thromboembolism and haemorrhage, laboratory parameters (Heptest, capillary blood, whole blood, and plasma, S 2222 factor Xa method, aPTT, thrornbin clotting time and AT III) and safety parameters were controlled every 4-6 weeks. The mean treatment period was 0,5 years summing up to a total observation period of 50 years. No fatal thromboembolism occured. 2 patients of group 1 experienced rethrombosis. One major gastrointestinal bleeding occured in a patient with a so far unknown colon carcinoma. Seven minor haemorrhages occured which did not re-occur after a 15 % dose reduction in these patients. All plasma samples were taken 2-4 hours after the s.c. injection. Heptest values from capillary blood and whole blood ranged from 30-60 sec., values in plasma ranged from 45-100 sec. S 2222 aXa method showed values ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 aXa units/ml, aPTT and TCT were only slightly prolonged. AT III and safety parameters remained unchanged during the observation period. Osteoporosis was not detected. 8 pregnant women were included in the study. No anti Xa activity was detected in blood drawn from the umbilical cord after delivery. The data suggest that LMWH can be effectively and safely used for prophylaxis of thromboembolism in patients with venous thromboembolism, artificial heart valve replacement, atrial fibrillation with arterial embolism, cardiomyopathy, and in pregnancy.",

            "text": "Two cases of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) typell with severe thrombo-embolic complications are reported. Thrombocytopenia occured 13(15) days after the onset of heparin therapy and platelet count dropped to the lowest value of 13 000(40 O00)/~l at the 16(24)th day. Thromboembolic complications under heparin treatment included pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis of the legs in both patients and additionally thrombosis of arm veins in one patient. Cessation of heparin resulted in normalization of platelet count within 8(3) days. Diagnosis of HIT was confirmed by in vitro plat~let aggregation tests. At the time of the patients thrombocytopenia normal donor platelets were used and mixed with the patients platelet poor plasma(PPP). Two commercial standard heparin preparations (from a minimum concentration of 0,2 IU/ml upwards) led to a strong aggregation of platelets in presence of either patients plasma. No remarkable aggregation could be seen with one of five tested LMWH fractions. This preparation and a second LMWH failed to aggregate platelets with the plasma of the second patient. Controls of all preparations were carried out in normal platelet rich plasma(PRP) and the use of donor platelets with a notable spontaneous or heparin dependent aggregation was excluded. Aggregation studies with the patients PRP were performed after normalization of their platelet count and no change in aggregation behaviour compared to the results with the mixture of donor platelets and patients PPP was observed. These results indicate that in patients with HIT i t might be very helpful to perform in vitro platelet aggregation studies with various LMWH fractions in order to select one preparation without aggregatoric potency that could be applied therapeutically.",

Conclusion: The treatment with LMWH seems to be an effective and safe treatment after PTCA with advantages in comparison to aspirin. Till now,after an initial bolus of about 10% of the total dosage rt-PA was given as a prolonged intravenous infusion because of its short half-life and in order to avoid early reocclusions. A single bolus would simplify the therapeutic regimen.+Therefore 20 patients (3 female, 17 male; mean age 55 -11 years) wish acute myocardial infarction (duration of symptoms 125 -58 min) were treated with a single rt-PA bolus of 50 mg intravenously (over 2 min).The basic therapy before lysis consisted in 5000 IU heparin, 500 mg ASA and nitroglycerin intravenously. Results: T~e fibrinogen lev~l {Clauss method) decreased from 2.7 -0.5 g/1 to 1.5 I 0.9 g/l after 2-4 hours and reached the initial value within 24 hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained in 7 patients by measuring rt-PA antigen levels in multiple plasma samples. Mean peak rt-PA concentration was 9.9 -3.8 ~g/ml, ~otal plasma clearance 490 \u00b1 150 ml/min and half-life 4.9 -1.9 min. Coronary angiography 60 min after rt-PA bolus revealed an open infract-related artery (TIMI 2,3) in 15/20 patients (=75%); in the remaining patients reperfusion was achieved by angioplasty (PTCA),intracoronary thrombolysis and twice an aorto-coronary bypass was necessary. Control angiography at 24 hours showed a reocclusion in 4/18 patients; during hospital stay PTCA and bypass grafting was performed in 10 patients.One female patient died 17 days after rt-PA bolus because of fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions: A single intravenous rt-PA bolus of 50 mg seems to provide similar patency rates and kinetics as the usual infusion;the incidence of bleedings requires further studies. Recombinant Hirudin (rH, CGP 39393) is a potent thrombin inhibitor. In addition to its anticoagulant effect, we were interested in its profibrinolytic activity in vitro and ex vivo. For the in vitro experiments the fibrinolytic activity of the euglobulin fraction (EGL) of 15 normal plasmas with or without urokinase (Uk) was tested in a fibrin plate assay both before and after addition of rH. The same cycle was repeated in 8 plasmas with heparin (Hep) instead of rH. For the test system EGL was obtained from 0.5ml plasma containing 5U Uk and 6.6 ttg rH or 0.5 U Hep and applied on human fibrin plates. For the ex vivo evaluation 12 healthy volunteers received 0.1-0.3 mg/kg/h rH for 6h. Blood samples were drawn at Oh, 6h, 12h and 24h. Fibrinogen (Fbg), plasminogen (Pig) and antiplasmin activity (AP), t-PA antigen and PAI activity, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT), rH levels (Elisa) and EGL fibrinolytic activity were assayed. RESULTS: rH induced more intensive fibrinolysis in synergism with Uk measured as lysis surface (mm 2) (Uk: 194.2~_46.6 vs Uk+rH: 245_+11.7, p<0.0001), rH enhanced the fibrinolytic activity of plasma (P) in the absence of Uk also (P: 55.2_+10.9 vs P+rH: 62.6+5.2, p<0.02). Heparin had a similar but slightly weaker effect with Uk (Hep+Uk: 180.1+55.7 vs rH+Uk: 188.4+_52.4, p<0.06) and without Uk (Hep: 67.5+-38.9 vs rH: 72.2_+44.4, p<0.2). Ex vivo on the other hand, Fbg (p<0.02), Pig (p<0.2) and AP (p<0.1) were slightly reduced at the end of 6h. From Oh to 6h PAI decreased from 24.7+8.6 to 13,1_+1.9 AU/ml (p<0.005) and t-PA from 4.5_+1.9 to 3.2_+1.0 ng/ml (p<0.001), a variation that parallels the normal circadian rhythm. TAT did not show Significant changes. The EGL of the proband plasmas spiked with Uk showed a stronger fibrinolytic activity (p<0.03) at 6h compared to those of Oh and 24h (Oh: 156.6_+76.6, 6h: 216.8_+33.9, 24h: 173.3_+61.5), but this activity did not correlate well with the rH levels. CONCLUSIONS: 1. In the presence of rH a slightly stronger fibrinolytic effect is observed measured as fibrin plate lysis activity both if rH is added to plasma in vitro and if it is administered intravenously. But this may be well explained by the specific anticoagulant action of rH and Hep in the dynamic equilibrium of fibrinolysis and clotting in the test system. 2. Under rH treatment the observed changes of Fbg, Pig, AP, t-PA and PAI although suggestive of enhanced fibrinolysis cannot be differentiated from the normal circadian rhythm of these proteins, since \"the highest ex vivo fibrinolytic activity coincides with the lowest PAI levels.",

The results of the coagulation tests were compared with the levels of cholinesterase (CHE) and albumin. In addition the levels of the liver enzymes: GGT, GOT, GPT and AP were determined. All the results were compared with the findings in 34 healthy persons. In the patients suffering form Cl we found the best significant correlation between PC and CHE (p<0.001), between PC and albumin (p<0.01), between AT III and CHE (p<0.001) and between AT III and albumin (p<0.01). By differentiation in compensated and decompensated groups of liver cirrhosis the correlations were still more pronounced. In the patients suffering from CAH a positive correlation could be demonstrated between PC and CHE (p<0.05) and between PC and albumin (p< 0.05). In this group we found neither a significant correlation between AT III and CHE nor between AT III and albumin. We could demonstrate that the decreased levels of the other parameters: plasminogen,~2-AP, fibrinogen, PT (in %), f.V, f.Vll and the increased levels of f.VIII:C and v.WF-Ag corresponded not significantly with the decrease of liver synthesis. PC and AT III proved to be the best prognostic markers for decreased liver synthesis in cirrhosis and CAH. (a) is an LDL-like particle to which the characteristic apolipoprotein (a) is attached by disulfide bonds to apo B-IO0. Human apo(a) cDNA contains domains homologous to kringles 4 and 5 and the protease domain of plasminogen. Recent reports suggest that Lp(a) in vitro inhibits streptokinase induced plasminogen activation and enhances ADP and epinephrine mediated platelet aggregation. Therefore we investigated the Lp(a) concentrations in 2 unrelated patients suffering from recurrent deep vein thromboses with proven abnormal plasminogen molecules and in their affected relatives. Furthermore we studied the levels of Lp(a) in 203 young patients below the age of 45 suffering from venous thromboses. Lp(a) was measured with a sandwich immunoradiometric assay using 2 different monoclonal antibodies. The assay proved specific for Lp(a) in that on immunoblotting analysis only the solid phase antiapo(a), but not the tracer Ab crossreacted with purified human plasminogen. The Lp(a) concentrations of the patients with abnormal plasminogen molecule corresponded to that of a healthy reference population. The levels of Lp(a) in the young patients suffering f;'om venous thromboses coincided with that in the normal controls (84 healthy blood donors). Therefore we concluded that there is no direct correlation between the Lp(a) concentration and the risk of venous thrombosis. A new abnormal plasminogen, Frankfurt II, has been identified in the plasma of a 27 year-old male patient who has a long history of recurring thromboembolic disease since age 6. He has a plasminogen functional deficiency, also the antigen concentration was slightly reduced. His plasmin generation rates were lower than normal as were those of other family members. His isolated Plg had a specific proteolytic activity of 15.0 IU/mg protein, about 50% of normal; family members values ranged from 17.5 to 23.5 IU/mg protein. Maximum active site generation rates in the equimolar Plg-Sk complex (0-60 min. at 37\u00b0C) ranged from 60% to 80% of normal for all family members, the propositus and his father were at the lower levels.",

Additionally we will report of more than 50 patients with severe acquired FXIII deficiency where bleeding complications were treated with different amounts of FXIII-concentrates. Laboratory tests performed 4 hours after the snake bite revealed a fibrinogen level of 0.25 g/1. Prothrombin time was prolonged above 300 seconds. Five hours after the snake bite, the patient was treated with 30 ml of equine antiserum and subsequently developed an anaphylaetic reaction with generalized erythema, dyspnea, vomiting and pruritus, which made the application of 250 mg of prednisolone and antihistaminic agents necessary. At the same time the patient suffered from considerable bleeding from the wound as well as from several i.v. puncture sites. Hematuria and mucosal bleeding did not occur. Six hours after the snake bite, coagulometric fibrinogen levels were not measurable, prothrombin time, aPTT and thrombin time were above 500 seconds. Tests for circulating fibrin monomer complexes were highly positive, D-Dimer test was elevated to 32 gtg/ml. Immunological fibrinogen measured by laser nephelometry was 1.64 g/l. Facor XIII activity, measured by dansylcadaverine assay was 6 %, factor XIII:A antigen level was approximately 20 %. Levels of prothrombin, factor V, factor VII and factor X were 34 %, 10 %, 27 % and 28 %, respectively, whereas levels of factors VIII, IX and XII were only moderately decreased or normal. Antithrombin III was reduced to 57 %. The patient was heparinized with 625 units of unfractionated heparin per hour intravenously and received additional 60 ml of equine antiserum, alongside with 250 mg of prednisolone and 2 g of human fibrinogen.",

Results of urinalysis did not differ from those of the control animals. Precipitative antibodies were not detectable. Histopathological changes due to chronic application of rH were not found.

The studies revealed that both single snd repeated application of the 10 -100 fold theropeutScally relevant dose rH was well toleretad. Lupus anticoagulants (LA) are a heterogenous group of antibodies directed against different phospholipids (PL). They affect various phospholipid dependent coagulation assays. We examined plasma samples of healthy volunteers (n = 10), patients in the stable phase of oral anticeagulation (n = 9) and patients with a LA (n = 14). In a modified aPTT determined with two different coagulation assays each plasma sample was tested with addition of various dilutions of a PL preparation. An index of modified aPTT performed with one particular PL dilution was calculated for every plasma sample. Plasma samples of healthy volunteers and anticoagulated patients showed similar increase of clotting time with increase of PL concentration. Concerning the calculated index there was no significant difference between both groups (p > 0.05). Plasma samples containing a LA demonstrated a shortening of clotting time with increasing amount of added PL. In contrast to the observations of other investigators different amounts of added PL were needed to minimize the clotting time of an individual plasma sample. Further increase of PL concentration led to an increase of clotting time. Independent from the used coagulation assay the calculated indexes in this group were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than those of normal or anticoagulated plasma. The test design seems to be a suitable confirmatory test for LA. Because of the variable PL concentration needed to minimize the clotting time, one particular index is probably not the best approximation for the in vitro activity of a LA.",

In particular, the flbrln(ogen) derivatives proved to be very sensitive Indicators in diagnosing and monitoring of DIC. In acute pancreatitis, for example, the elevation of enzymes was followed by an Increase of soluble fibrin and subsequently of degradation products detectable by FbDP-, D<Iimsr-ELISA or even common latex tests, which all indicate the direct onset of 'reactive flbrinolysls'. Due to the relatively large reservoir of protein clmulatlng In plasma, the concentrations of coagulation factors or Inhibitors were often not decreased although flbrln(ogen) derivatives ware already elevated. Flbrlnogen concentrations were of low diagnostic value, slnoa they were distlnctly lowered only at a very late stage of consumption coagulopathy or even Increased due to flbrlnogen's property as an acute phase protein. In contrast, protein C, antlthromb[n lit, and course observations of platelet counts proved to be more sensitive parameters in indicating a consumption of the bamostatic potential and deserve further consideration in DIC diagnostics, since they are of both pathognomonic and pathogenetlc relevance. The detection of elevated concentrations of thrombln-antithrombln-complexes (TAT) was a sensitive marker of an activation of coagulation factors with thrombin generation; correlations with the formation of soluble fibrin were found. However, due to the antithrombln Inhibition, TAT levels do not provide information about the 'net thrombln activity' on the fibrlnogan molecule. In conclusion, flbrin(ogen)-derivatives are of central importance in DIC; they reliably Indicate the continuation of an increased blood coagulation turnover whereas other parameters merely mark the loss of haemostatic potential or activation not resulting in an flbrinogen-turnover.",

In order to make the reagent particularly suitable for monitoring oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), the manufacturing procedure has been especially set up to enhance sensitivity. The ISI (International sensitivity index) of PT FIB H.S. has a typical value 7.35, which makes it comparable to the 2nd BCR RM for Rabbit Thromboplastin. Other characteristics of the reagent on the ACL: normal PT range between 11.5 and 15.0 seconds, therapeutic activity range for OAT between 16% and 34%: about 15 seconds of difference between 100% and 28% in a calibration curve prepared by dilution, excellent precision, insensitivity to heparin up to 0.5 IU/ml. A comparison has been carried out with two widely used reagents on samples collected from healthy donors, patients under OAT and patients with liver diseases. The reagent may be easily used -coupled with a set of deficient plasmas -for the determination of the single factors of the extrinsic pathway. In the analysis of fibrinogen linearity up to at least 700 mg/dl has been observed. A comparison with semi-automatic determination according to Clauss is shown. ",

Though thrombolysls in accute myocardial infarction is very efectlve to restore coronary reperfusion a considerable number of patients (pts) experiences reoccluslon. In order to investigate the role of residual thrombus (RT) after thrombolysis coronary angiograms (CA) were performed in 72 pts after urokinase preactivated pro-uroklnase therapy. In 39 pts thrombolysis was successfull. Assessed by 3 independent investigators in 26 (66.7%) out of these 39 pts RT was diagnosed. Control CA in 27 pts (19 with RT, 8 without RT) 24-36 h later revealed reoccluslon in 26.3% of pts wlth RT, but in none without RT(p<0.05). The result was much more significant at control 17-23 days later (24 pts: 16 wlth RT, 8 without RT) when 43.8% of pts with RT and only 12.5% without RT showed reoccluslon(p<0.0l). Other angiographic assessable risk factors are preexisting stenosis diameter and diminished perfusion. We could not find a correlation between the extend of presisting stenosis and early reocolusion. But TIMI IIl perfusion was seen less frequently in pts with RT (50% vs77%; p<0.02). Thus after thrombolytic therapy RT seems to be an additional major determinant of early reoccluslon. Aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationships between PAI and age, several metabolic and glyco-metabolic parameters and some clotting and fibrinolysis parameters in 148 diabetics, The correlation between PAI and age, expressed as coefficient of correlation amounted for males r=-9.5 E-3; p=0.94, for females r = 0.14; p= 0.18. Significant correlations (p<0.05) to PAl were found for cholesterol, Chol/HDL-chol ratio, triglycerides and fructosamine with coefficients of correlations of respectively 0.02, 0.01, 0.0008 and 0.05. To HDL-cholesterol, HbA1c and urinary microalbumin we found moderately significant correlations of r= -0.11 (p= 0.18), r= 0.10 (p= 023) a~d r--I! I? (p= 01~I) N~, ::ignJfJcant correlation was found of PAI to thrombin-antithrombin III complex and D-dimer. Splitting up the significant results we obtained significant differences of the mean PAI levels when comparing the triglycerides under and over 2.0 mmol/ L, the cholesterol levels under and over 7.5 mmol/L and the cholesterol/HDL ratio under and over 5.0 mmol/L. The HDL-cholesterol level was splitted up for males at 0.9 mmol/L, for females at 1.2 mmol/L. The PAl means were only significantly different in the male group. Moreover there could be calculated, if dividing the male and female Patients in groups under and over 50 years old, significant differences between the female PAI concentrations, whereas the differences between the male and female over 50 groups were significant too. (1,2) . Therefore patients of vWD type III should produce antibodies against vWF by repeated substitutions (3, 4] . In our case a patient with vWD type III was substituted during 5 clinical treatments with 3500 units Ristofact and with more than 200 ku cryoglobulin. 6 weeks after the last treatment an antibody against vWF was detected in his plasma with the immunoelectrophoreses and immunofixation. This antibody was in vitro tried to be neutralized by isolated vWF. Therefore several plasma dilutions were mixed with different concentrations of vWF and incubated i h by 37 C. The remaining vWF, which has not reacted with the antibody, was quantitatively analysed by an ELISA-test. The antibody concentration was estimated to be 0.4 U/ml by the result~ngs of titration cur~es. Detection of an antibody against vWF was rarely described in literature, though it was expected to be present in patients with vWD type III (3, 4] . As we me,sure high titer of vWF-antibody, we suppose repeated substitution booster antibody production. From the estimated antibody concentration we calculate a total antibody quantity of 1000 U in blood of the patient. These results show, that additional i000 units of vWF are necessary in therapy to neutralize the antibody before a correction of the bleeding disorder can be recognized. We conclude, that the possible production of an antibody against vWF represents a further complication in the treatment of patients with vWD type III. Impaired fibrinolysis causes a reduction of the defensive potency against acute coronary occlusion and fibrin formation; in addition, the process of fibrin deposition in the arterial intima may he accelerated by a diminished fibrinolytic activity. In the scope of the Prospective Cardiovascular N~nster (PROCAM) study (which was initiated to improve the predictive power in the recognition of individuals at risk for CHD) the fihrinolytic system in employees in Westfalia and the northern Ruhr area was characterized by measuring the plasminogen activator inhihitor-I (PAl-I) using a chromogenic assay, the euglobulin fibrinolytic activity (EFA), as well as the tissue-type plasminogen activator activity (t-PA) on fibrin plates. PAI-I in men (n=1322, ~=3.7 \u00b12.9 U/ml) showed a strong positive correlation to triglyeerides (r=0.49 ***) and body mass index (BMI) (r=0.42\"**). Other known risk factors of MI exhibited weaker, but significant relations: diastolic blood pressure (r=0.28\"**), cholesterol (r=0.24\"**), llDLchol. (r=-O.19***) and factor VIIc (r=0.28\"**). The euglobulin fihrinolytic activity (n=618, ~=87.1 \u00b123.4% of a normal pool) was higher in men with high llPL-cholesterol (HDL>55mg/dl: 93.6 \u00b126.5% vs. HDL<35mg/dl: 82.5 \u00b122.1%). DMI (r= -0.13\"*) and systolic b.p. (r=-O.13 **) negatively correlated to EFA. The t-PA-activity on fibrin plates with added Ct-inactivator (n= 615, ~=92.5 \u00b119.1% of a normal pool) exhibited positive correlations to EFA (r= 0.50***), as well as to protein C (r=0.16***) and ATIII (r=0.27\"**). (* =p<O.05; ** =p<O.Ol; *** =p<O.001) In conclusion, these hemostaseological variables delineate an evident relationship between fibrinolysis and risk factors of arterial as well as venous thrombus formation. Platelet inhibitory principles are usually evaluated in-vitro employing a single platelet stimulator.

Therefore, a study was undertaken to compare, under stimulatory conditions of different strength, the potency of two classes of platelet inhibitors: (1) inhibitors of intracellular stimulatory pathways, llke the prostacyelin mimic cicaprost, and the cyeloox'ygeuase inhibitor asphin, and (2) inkibitors of extracellular agglutination, llke the aspeeitie tetrapeptide RGDS, and the dodecapeptide from the gamma-chain of human fibrinogen (FIBGAM).",

We therefore studied the effect of the PGI2-mimic iloprost, which has potent antlplatelet and antithrombotie properties, on lysis rate with t-PA and reocclnsion in a canine model of coronary thrombosis. In anaesthetized beagle dogs occlusive thrombus formation was induced by introduction of a copper coil into a branch of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). Occlusion of the LCX was assessed by coronary angiography and typical ECG-changes. 60 rain after occlusion all animals were anticoagulated with heparin (200 IU/kg i.v. + s.c.). Further treatment was either iloprost (30 ng/kg/min i.e.), rt-FA (50 ~g/kg + 10 izg/kg/min i.v.), a combination of both or solvents, t-PA inhtsian was maintained until 15 rain after reperfasion of the LCX. Iloprost i.e. was continued to the end of the observation period, i.e. further 180 rain or until reocelusiou + 30 rain. Mean time to occlusion ( \u00b1 SEM; n =25) was 28.5 -+ 6 rain. Reper-fusion was achieved within 10 -50 rain in all dogs receiving t-PA or t-PA + iloprost, in 4/7 dogs on iloprost alone and in 2/6 controls. All coronaries in controls and in the group on t-PA alone reoccluded or remained occluded while none of the dogs (0/6) treated with t-PA + iloprost showed LCX reocclnsion until the end of the observation period. 2 COronaries with reperfusion during iloprost only remained patent as well. There was no difference in t-PA-antigen plasma levels in the two t-PA groups (peak levels around 640 ng/ml), neither in the decreases of o~2-AP or fibrinogeu (to about 50 % of prevalues). 30 ng/kg/min i.e. iloprost caused a moderate hypotemion.",

There is also a tendency with iloprost alone to enhance and to maintain spontaneous lysis. Platelet PAL1 represents a major pool of the total blood PAI-1 level. When released into the plasma it might contribute significantly to a prethrombotic state by dowuregulatiou of fibrinolysis. We therefore investigated the effects of a prostacyclin mimic (cicaprost), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (aspirin), an antiadhesive tetrapeptide (RGDS), and an antlaggregating dodecapeptide from the gamma-chain of human fibrinogan (FIBGAM) on collagen induced aggregation of and PAI-1 release from human platelets. Citrated human PRP was treated with collagen (5 izg/ml) to induce aggregation aad release reaction. Antiplatelet agents were added 10 rain prior to the addition of activator. The samples were incubated for 15 min in an aggragomcter before they were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. The cellfree plasma was snap frozen and kept at -27 \u00b0C until PAI-1 determination. PAI-1 was determined with a two-site sandwich-ELISA employing a monoclonal and a polycional anti-PAI-l-antibody. The biological activity of the released PAL1 was assessed in a modified clot lysis assay employing an anti-PAI-l-antibody which inhibits t-PA inactivation by PALL Results: Activated platelets inhibit clot lysis in vitro. This effect can be reversed by addition of a specific anti-FAI-l-antibedy. Only the common pathway inhibitor of platelct activation cicaprost is capable to effectively inhibit PAl-1 release from stimulated pintelets with an IC50 identical to the IC50 for inhibition of platelet aggregation.

            "text": "B. Baldus, G. Gehrmann, P.FJ. Verhallen, W. Witt Activated platelets significantly contribute to the generation of thrombin in a plasma system in vitro. This is mainly due to the formation of the prothrombinas\u00a2 complex e.g. the assembly of clotting factors X and V on negatively charged phospholipids provided on the outer membrane of collagenor thrombin-activated platelets. Prothrombinase formation enhances prothrombin activation velocity by several orders of magnitude. Recently an dagant method was published to measure thrombin generation in pLatelet rich plasma triggered with high dilutions of tissue thromboplastin (S. Btguin et a1.,1989 Thromb.Haemostas., 61, 25-29) . This method allows to study the effect of antithrombotic agents on the cooperative interaction between platelcts and the coagulation system. It was the aim of the present study to investigate the influence of different classes of antiplatelct agents on thrombopLastin induced thrombin generation in PRP and to compare their effects with those of antithxombotic agents acting mainly on plasma factors. AntipLatelet agents chosen were the prostacyclin mimics iloprost and cicaprost, the antiadhesive teh'apeptide RGDS and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin. Anticoagulants used were an unfractionated heparin, a heparin fragment and natural hirudin. Results: Iloprost, cicaprost as well as the tetrapcptide RGDS inhibited thrombin generation in PRP induced by thromboplastin in a dose dependent manner. Maximal eflScacy for all three agents tested was 60 % inhibition. Their potency was in the same order as for inh'bition of platelet aggregation induced by strong agonists. All three agents not only inhibited maximal thrombin generation but also postponed the thrombin burst. Aspirin even at 3 mM did not show any effect in our system. Both types of heparins tested dose-dependentiy inhibited ma.,dmal thrombin generation and delayed-thrombin burst indicating a similar mode of action. Hirudin dose dependently postponed the thrombin burst only. We conclude from this study that common pathway inhibitors of platelet activation like iloprost and eicaprost may have anticoagulant properties possibly by inhibiting prothrombinase formation. The surprising effect of RGDS may indicate that platelet aggregate formation also plays a role in prothrombin activation velocity in platelet rich plasma.",

Samples were sequentially taken from coagulating whole blood in order to determine the concentrations of the release proteins platelet factor 4 (PF 4) and B-thromboglobulin (BTG) and of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) as a measure of thrombin activity. Controls initially show a small secretion of the variables (\"slow phase\") followed by a fast increase of concentrations after 5 to 6 minutes of incubation (\"fast phase\"). Collagen (2 ug/ml) causes an initial increase of the PF 4-concentration (21+16 vs. 4.9+1.5 ng/ml) which approximates to the ~ontrols in-the fast phase. The FPA-generation shows an earlier begin of the fast phase than in control~ (3.8~1.7 vs. 4.8+0.8 min).

The patients suffered from 3-10 bloody stools daily and there was no improvement upon administration of corticosteroids and 5-ASA for at least two weeks.

SubstitutionRof 1250 units of F XIII concentrate (Fibrogammin , Behring, F.R.G.) -in addition to treatment with steroids and 5-ASA -for i0 days resulted in a decrease of stool frequency (1-2 normal stools daily) and intestinal blood loss. F XIII activity (I: 164%; II: 173%; III: 96%) and F XIII A levels (I: 333%; II: 231%; III: 150 %) increased in all patients. Decreased F XIII activity in patients with active ulcerative colitis are presumably a result of consumption of F XIII in the inflamed bowel tissue. F XIII substitution seems to reduce the stool frequency and the intestinal blood loss.

Res. 25: 341, 1982 ; own results). The microembolization of labelled platelets in the lung was used as an in vivo model to evaluate the effect of PAF and inhibitory drugs. Following injection of 51Chromium-labelled homologous platelets into urethane-anesthetized rats the distribution was continously monitored using collimated crystal scintillation probes. Count rates and the ratio of two detectors (ci/c2) one placed above the thorax (cl), the other above the abdomen (c2) -were calculated and displayed by a microcomputer-based system. A bolus injection of PAF resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent sequestration of 51Chromiumlabelled platelets in the lung. This process was reversible and not redeemable by a second application of PAF indicating a desensitization. Nevertheless labelled platelets were still able to react to other platelet stimuli e.g. ADP. PAF-induced (5 ug/kg) pulmonary platelet accumulation could be completely overcome by prior injection of the specific PAF-antagonist WEB 2170 (BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM). Pretreatment of the animals with pentoxifylline and acetylsalicylic acid, administered successively (principle of HWA 5112) also exerted a significant inhibition\u00b0 These results indicate that, in contrast to the situation in vitro, a PAF-specific activation of platelets is achievable in vivo. The detection of the multimeric structure of yon Willebrand factor is an important method of subtyping yon Willebrand's disease. We report an electrophore~c method, in which the yon Willebrand factor multimers are separated in a 1,0% agarose gel, using a discontinous buffersystem. The gel was lying on the water-repellent side of a ~el bond film and cooled at a temperature of 12vC. At the end of the separation the top side of the gel was covered with a nylonmembrane having a pore size of 0,2 ~m. The sandwich was with the nylon-membrane infront overturned on a carbon electrode, covered with filter papers, soaked in anode-buffer. After remove of the gel bond the sandwich was completed by bringing up filter papers, soaked in ~athode-buffer, and a second carbon electrode. The semi-dry blotting was performed by a constant current of 15mA for 17 hours. The visualization of von Willebramd factor multimers was carried out by use of a peroxidase conjugated rabbit antibody to human factor VIII vWf. The present method has a high degree of resolution and consumes, compared with conventional methods, using tank-blotting and immunochemical sandwich techniques, less buffer, antibody solutions and time. Problems, using radioactive marked antibodies, are avoided. Any change of hydrogen ion concentration could change the dissociation of proteins and possibly plasma and blood rheology. We measured therefore plasma and blood viscosity (capillary hose viscosimeter KSPV 4, RHEOMED for the plasma, WELLS-BROOKFIELD cone plate viscosimeter with shear rates of 230,4, 115.2, 46,08 and 23.04/'\" for the blood) at different pH-values. We draw blood from three volunteers from an antecubital vein after venous stasis with a tourniquet for 5\" and vigorous exercise with that arm. The initial pCO2 was between 54.1 and 75.3 mmHg, the pH between 7.232 and 7.06. Measurements were done immediately and then every 30\" for 2 hours. The specimens were kept open, so that CO2 could leave the blood or plasma. At the last measurement the pCO2 was between 11.1 and 6.1 mmHg, the pH between 7,472 and 7.608. Plasma and blood viscosity remained statistically unchanged at all pH rp. pCO2-values. We conclude that alterations of the acid base balance do not influence blood or plasma rheology. Aim of this study was to find the best mathematical model fitting the curve that express the aggregation phenomenon when evaluated by means of impedance aggregometry on whole blood. Venous blood samples were collected from I00 healthy subjects (50 males and 50 females). Platelet aggregation was measured by a Chrono-Log aggregometer; collagen, at different concentration, was used as proaggregating agent. The mathematical analysis of the curves was performed by means of the least square method. The best model fitting the curves was the hyperbolic function Z=K*tm,where Z is the impedance and t the ti~le while K and m are the regression coefficients. The chi-square method and the Fisher's test confirmed the expressed hypothesis. The m parameter represents the per cent variation (positive, null or negative) of impedance for a per cent unitary variation of time. A normal distribution of the m values has been obtained from our samples. The normal range in our laboratory was 0.39+/-0.08. Values above or below this range could be respectively considered as expressing hyper or nypoaggregating situations. This simple but exact method could allow an easier clinical interpretation of platelet aggregation on whole blood. Aim of the present study was to investigate possible changes of platelet aggregability occurring during aging in healthy subjects. Platelet aggregation was evaluated in a group of 40 individuals (20 nlales, 20 females) whose age ranged from 50 to 5g years (mean 65.6 years).Criteria for inclusion were the absence of metabolic and/or cardio vascular disease, including hypertension, Furthermore, they were on no medications nor were they suffering from any acute or chronic illness. In the same way, 40 individuals watched for sew and smoking habits, whose age ranged from 40 to 59 years {wean 46.5 years),were enroled as control group. Platelet aggregability was evaluated by iaeans of impedance aggregometry using a whole blood Chrono-Log aggregometer; collagen at different concentration was used as proaggregating factor. Venous oIood sa~iples were collected without stasis in the fasting subject after 2 hours bed rest; blood was anticoagulated with sodium citrate 3.8%.

This is the case in patients with a c t i v a t i o n of the intrinsic or extrinsic coagulation system. Both systems result in an activation of factor IX, so that its inactivated form is the first common s e r p i n c o m p l e x of the cascade. In patients under heparin treatment, sometimes it is the only indicator of plasmatic h y p e r c o a g u l a b i l i t y and frequently a unique elevated factor IX-AT complex can be seen in patients without heparin therapy. G e n e r a l l y it can be established, that in patients with activated coagulation but il~tact inhibitor potential (sometimes upholded by heparin), the serpin complex sequence is IXIAT > X, AT > TAT. In contrast to this, in patients with malignancies, shock or after serious operative treatment, the activation seems to be nearly u n r e s t r i c t e d by i n h i b itors with the sequence IXJAT < XIAT < TAT. We recommend to determine serpin complexes in those patients, which are known to be at high risk for thrombosis as well as in those patients, which are under heparin therapy for e s t a b l i s h i n g hypercoagulability. . While NO-compounds directly activate sGC, the nitrates need to be metabolized to release nitric oxide prior to activation of the enzyme. In vitro only NO-containing agents, but not nitrates, can stimulate sGC in platelets and potently inhibit aggregation. We have compared in a doubleblind study the effectiveness of each a single oral dose of molsldomlne (4mg), 5-1SMN (20rag) or placebo to inhibit platelet function ex vivo and to influence the fibrinolytic potential in twelve healthy volunteers. Before, 80 and 60 mln after drug intake plasma concentrations of tlssue-plasminogen-activator (t-PA) and the activity of plasminogenactivator-inhlbitor I (PAl-I) were determined. RESULTS: Platelet aggregation ex vivo was significantly inhibited after intake of molsidomine and to a minor degree following 6-ISMN. Plasma concentrations of t-PA were reduced by 10% after 5-1SMN and placebo, but increased by 6% after molsidomine. The activity of the inhibitor (PAl-I) was increased by 11% after 5-ISMN, while placebo and molsldomlne provoked decreases in PAl-activity by 6% and 13%, respectively. The overall fibrinolytic potential (calculated by the relation of t-PA/PAI) was absolutely unchanged after placebo, was decreased by 15% and 12% 30 and 60 min after 5-ISMN and was significantly increased by 7% (30 min) and by 45% (60 min, p<0.05) after intake of molsidomine. CONCLUSIOn: The present results suggest t h a t molsidomlne, but not organic nitrates, induces an increase in fibrlnolytic potential in vlvo. Since both drugs (molsidomine and 5-ISMN) have vasodilatory and p l a t e l e t i n h i b i t i n g properties ex vlvo, their different effects on fibrlnolytlc parameters may be an additional a d v a n t a g e of molsidomlne in the clinical practice.

            "text": "When PAIs in the plasma sample are incubated with urokinase for 5 min, the only significant contribution to the inhibition of urokinase arises from PAI-I. By extending the incubation period to 30 min, PAI-2 can be determined in addition to PAI-I. The inhibition of urokinase by PAI-3 becomes apparent only in the presence of heparin. Thus it is possible to differentiate between the type of PAI p r e s e n t in plasma by varying the incubation period in the presence or absence of heparin. The interaction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAl-l) with its binding protein vitronectin (VN) (JBC 263:15454-15461, 1988 ) was studied utilizing purified human components, and the possible contribution of VN in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cultured human endothelial cells (EC) was addressed\u2022 While platelets and EC constitute two major sites of storage or production, respectively, of PAl-l, little is known about the distribution of VN at these sites. The high specific PAl-1 capacity in the ECM of cultured EC is suggestive for the stabilization of PAl-1 by matrix component(s). While VN was found associated in high molecular weight complexes together with plateletderived PAl-1 in the supernatant of stimulated platelets, only small amounts of VN were detectable in cultured EC. In contrast, substantial quantities of VN could be detected in the intact ECM of these cells. Direct binding of recombinant PAl-1 to the PAl-l-depleted ECM was inhibited mainly by antibodies against VN indicating that VN constitutes the primary binding component for PAl-1 in the ECM of EC. Binding studies of PAl-1 to immobilized VN further revealed that, unlike urokinase, heparin did not inhibit PAl-1 binding, although PAl-1 as well as biotinylated hepadn bound to the same 10-15 kDa fragments entailing the glycosaminoglycan binding domain of VN. These results provide evidence not only for the occurrence of both, VN and PAl-1 in platelet storage granules as well as in the ECM of EC, but also for a functional link between both components resulting in the stabilization of PAl-1 activity particularly at platelet-ECM sites of interaction. The extracellular VN-PAI.1 relationship may have significant implications for the regulation of plasminogen activation in general and the protection of the ECM against proteolysis. (VN) represents a multifunctional adhesive extra. cellular protein operative in the regulation of the hemostatic system. VN is found in plasma as intact molecule (M r 78,000) and in a partially proteolyzed form (M r 65,000); the ratio of both forms varies individually. The physiological significance of this distribution, however, is unclear. Monoclonal antibodies against VN were obtained from female balb/c mice immunized with a mixture of native and proteolyzed antigen. Positive clones were detected by ELISA type assay using highly purified human VN. One monoclonal (SP1C5) was selected by westernblot analysis for its reactivity exclusively with the intact VN molecule but not with the partially degraded po]ypeptide, indicating that SP1C5 may react with an epitope in the carboxy-terminal portion of VN, entailing the intact sensitive peptide bond (Arg-378, Ala-379). The reactivity of SP1C5 with different VN preparations correlated well with the concentration of proteolyzed VN in the respective samples. A direct correlation between decreasing reactivity of SP1C5 with timedependent proteolysis of intact VN by human plasmin or elastase but not by tPA was also found. Moreover, SP1C5 inhibited proteolysis of VN at the sensitive peptide bond. A sandwich ELISA was established using SP1C5 as tagging antibody and polyclonal anti-VN as detection antibodies. Drastic variances in the concentration of intact VN in normal individual plasma samples were found (30-100% of maximal reactivity), although the total VN concentration in these samples varied only minimally. The monoclonal SP1C5 may thus be helpful in monitoring VN-proteolysis by circulating proteases in plasma and to establish correlations with VN dys-function in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. A simple detection system is thereby provided which may also help to detect possible polymorphic forms of VN. The endothelial cell thrombin receptor thrombcmodulin (TM) is an inhibitor of coagulation (a) by serving as a cofactor for thrombin-induced protein C activation, (b) by directly affecting the procoagulant activity of thrombin and (c) by accelerating the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin II1. We have recently proposed the presence of a dermatan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycan region in rabbit TM which may constitute a secondary binding site for thrombin, required for both activities (b),(c). In the present study the effects of TM on the inactivation of thrombin by another serine protease inhibitor, heparin cofactor II (HCll) whose activity is dependent on glycosaminoglycans, were investigated. In a dose-dependent fashion TM effectively protected thrombin against fast inactivation by HCII/dermatan sulfate. Similar effects were also found in this inhibition reaction if dermatan sulfate was omitted or was replaced by heparin, respectively. Removal of the secondary binding site of TM by chondroitin-ABC-lyase resulted in partial reduction of the thrcmbin protecting effect of TM. it is thus concluded that binding of TM to thrombin renders the enzyme resistant against inactivation by HCII. In another experimental set-up using intact cultured human endothelial cells no appreciable thrombin inhibition by HCII occurred on the surface of these cells. From these findings we conclude that under quiescent conditions neither in the fluid phase nor at the intact vessel wall thrombin inhibition by HCII is of major importance. Rather endothelial cell components may protect thrombin against inactivation by this protease inhibitor.",

M011er-Berghaus The assembly of the extrinsic pathway activation complex on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) was studied by binding assays with purified factor VII (FVlI) and factor Vlla (FVIla). Functionally, FVll(a)-binding was estimated by the rate of factor X (FX)-activation on the surface of endotoxin-stimulated and non-stimulated EC, respectively. FXa-formation occurred only on stimulated EC, was saturable within 90-120 min and could be inhibited by tissue factor (TF)-specific polyclonal antibodies, indicating the participation of EC-derived TF. Physically, binding of radiolabeled FVII/VIla occurred to stimulated as well as to unstimulated EC. Total bindina was calcium-, temperatureand time-dependent. Binding of 12~I-FVlI/FVIla was inhibited to about 50% by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ligand(s). After reaching equlibrium within 4.5-6 h, reversibility of binding was demonstrated within 2 h by the displacement of 45-50% of bound radioligands. The interaction was characterized by a dissociation constant K D = 51.7 + 92.9 riM. Other vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, in particular prothrombin, displaced binding of \u00b0I-FVll by 15-30% and binding of 1251-F'Vlla by 35-40%, whereas non-related proteins were not effective. These data suggest the involvement of an apparently TF-independent ECbinding site on both types of cells which appears not to be exclusively specific for FVlI/FVlla. The TF-mediated'binding was studied by adding 12OI-FVII/FVlla to EC in the presence of 5uM prothrombin as an unspecific competitor. Using this experimental approach bound radioactivity (about 60% of total) could be further suppressed by polyclonal TF-antibodies only on endotoxin-stimulated EC. The time course of specific FVII/ FVIlabinding, measured by determining the amount of dis-placable radioligands by TF.specific antibodies, reached saturation within 90-120 min, which was in good agreement with the kinetics of binding isothermes, measured via FXa-generation. Our results document that specific TF-dependent binding sites for FVII/ FVIla exist on perturbed EC and are required for effective FXactivation.

Factor XIII (F XIII) of the blood clotting cascade is a proenzyme which, after activation with thrombin, crosslinks proteins by a transamidation reaction, and has major functions in wound healing. The plasma form is built up by two different chains (a and b) from which the a-chain contains the active centre. F XIII Occurs also intracellularly in platelets, monocytes and placenta. In these cells only dimers of the a-chain are found. F XIII from placenta is well characterized and the amino acid sequence has been determined by Takahashi et al.(19~ For further characterization and understanding of the strUcture/function relationship x-ray diffraction analysis could be valuable. To enable such investigations we tried to obtain crystals with suitable quality.Previously Bohn etal, (1971) crystallized F XIII from placenta and platelets by dialysis against distilled water. Applying this method for F XIII from placenta we obtained small hexagonal and monoclinic crystals. To get larger crystals, we examined a nund0er of different crystallization conditions and found indeed some, yielding acceptable crystals from recombinant F XIII and F XIII of placenta origin. Precipitation with sodium acetate (9 -I0 % (w/v)) in Tris~buffered solution by vapour diffusion yields thin needles up to 1 .~m. Using ammonium sulfate (0,5 -0,9 % (w/v)) we received hexagonal and monoclinic crystals up to 0,5 mm long. Precipitation with arm~Onium acetate or ammonit~n sulfate (9,6 % (w/v)) in Tris-buffered solution by vapour diffusion in the hanging or laying drop leads to crystals with orthorhombic symmetzy. Single crystals with edges up to 0,25 ntm could be obtained. X-ray investigations of these crystals are ongoing to prove their quality for diffraction analysis.",

The present study aimed at investigating i) whether this increased activity would result in an increased cytosolic pH (pH i) and ii) whether the increased activity is an epiphenomenon rather than a causative factor in essential hypertension. Platelets were loaded with the fluorescent pH i indicator BCECF. The platelets were suspended in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) at 37~C and the cytosol was acidified by addition of increasing amounts of propionic acid. The recovery of pH i towards the initial values was recorded and the initial slopes of the fluorescence tracings were used to estimate the activity of Na+/H + exchange. The pH i of resting platelets in normotension (7.14 + 0.04, n=10) did not significantly differ from that in essential hypertension (7.16 + 0.04; n-8). In contrast, the initial rate of pH i recovery from an artificial acid load in essential hypertension was enhanced by a mean factor of 3.9 (range 2-5; n=8) as compared to platelets from normotensives. In contrast, platelets from patients with secondary hypertension (renal artery stenosis) had both a normal pH i and Na+/H + exchange activity. The following conclusions can be drawn: i) Overexpression of Na+/H + exchange activity in essential hypertension does not occur as a result of elevated blood pressure. In contrast, this phenomenon may constitute a causative factor in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, ii) Overexpression of Na+/H + exchange activity does not result in an increased pH i. iii) The increased activity of the platelet Na+/H + exchanger may contribute to the hyperreactivity of platelets in essential hypertension.

From this experiment it emerged that the results of the TAT-complex measured in blood taken from the IDC displayed higher readings than in blood obtained through cannulation with a butterfly and that it increased in proportion to the time of passage. In addition two groups of patients were examined. The first group consisted of patients who had to undergo a PTCA, whereas the second one were to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. It turned out that, after an injection of 15,000 U of heparin and after extracorporeal circulation, the TAT-complex increased, which suggests an increased activation of coagulation. Despite these results the question whether the TAT-test is a suitable one to be carried out routinely, still remains open because it is the method of taking blood samples which is of major importance, and falsely positive results are achieved very frequently. Therapy with vincristine and prednisolone caused a pronounced decrease in fibrinogen levels in 9 patients treated for lymphoid blast crisis (LBC) of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In two patients the initial decrease in white blood cell count (WBC) in response to therapy was accompanied by a marked decrease in fibrinogen levels to values below 80 ng/d], within 'he first three days of trealmu.L, a pronounced rise i,, b-Db,er ieveis~ the occurence of soluble fibrin in the circulation and a drop in platelet count to values below 20.000 cells/u]. Induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC in these two patients caused profuse bleeding and necessitated substitution therapy with fibrinogen and platelet concentrates. In the remaining 7 patients no signs of DIC were detected after initiation of therapy, nevertheless 4 of them showed a moderate increase in D-Dimer levels. In these patients a well known side effect of steroid therapy, namely a decrease in fibrinogen levels accnrding to the half life of 96 hours was observed. Fibrinugen levels did not fall below 150 mg/dl and increased after dose reduction from 100 mg/day to 50 mg/day. We conclude from our results that \"two types of disturbances in fibrinogen metabolism can be observed during vincristine/prednisolone therapy of LBC in CML: i) a decrease in fibrinogen levels according to its biological half life due to a steroid mediated impairment of liver synthesis and 2) a rapid fall in fibrinogen levels in the course of DIC most likely induced by the release of procoagulants from detoriating blast cells, leading to severe bleeding. Therefore blood coagulation parameters should carefully be monitored in such clinical settings. Human and bovine platelets were fixed by impact freezing and freeze-substitution in resting state and after activation. Electron micrographs of serial sections were digitized by a Macintosh II computer (Apple Inc.), and threedimensional reconstruction was done with regard to the surface shape, the distribution of internal organelles, the contractile sphere, and the distribution of microtubules. The program allows presentation of different selections of the components of the models under various aspects. Transparent reconstruction of some surfaces give insight into internal organizations.",

Endotoxins induce a variety of functional alterations in cultured endothelial cells such as expression of tissue thromboplastin, downregutation of thrombomodulin, and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 synthesis. In order to gain more insight into the expression of surface protein expression, we immunized mice with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which had been pretreated with endotoxin for 24 hours, and raised monoclonal antibodies directed against endotoxin-treated HUVEC. Four monoclonals were isolated which showed markedly increased binding to endotoxin-treated HUVEC. One of these monoclonals, designated EC-HTC7, has been characterized. EC-H7C7-binding to HUVEC increased after 4 h treatment with endotoxin (from S. enteritides), reached a maximum at 8 hours and remained constant up to at least 24 hours. The expression of the antigen was dose-dependent As little as 1 ng/ml of endotoxin induced an increase of binding of EC-H7C7 to HUVEC, maximal binding was observed at 30 ng/ml. The antibody showed no binding to human fibroblasts before or after stimulation with endotoxin. The epitope recognized by this antibody was not induced by treating the cells with thrombin or phorbol esters which are known to induce the expression of tissue thromboplastin, indicating that it does not react with tissue thromboplastin. The antibodies raised against endotoxin-activated HUVEC most likely recognize so far unknown epitopes on the surface of endothelial cells, and may help to characterize the surface alterations induced by endotoxin. showed a significantly enhanced HR, particularly in severe PAD end diabetic macro-angiopath~;mainly due to:codsfderabIy blevated RBC aggregation and increased plasma viscosity. Both haemorheological parameters closely correlated with fibrinogen concentration. SPA proved to be activated in the same patient groups. These changes may promote thrombogeneeis, especially in areas characterized by e pronounced passive movement of blood towards the vascular wall. Additionally, they indicate an increased risk of blood flow limitation in the disturbed microcirculation. Therefore special treatment to improve diminished blood fluidity and to inhibit raised plstelet activity is indicated.

The multimeric glycoprotein von Willebrand Factor (vWF) fulfills two biological functions: it promotes platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium and acts as a carrier protein for coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII). The present investigation was concerned with the carrier function of vWF for FVIII, specifically the vWF component of FVIII/vWF complex was studied. Native, plasmaderived FVIII/vWF complex was analyzed under nondenaturating conditions by ultracentrifugation using a 3-30% linear sucrose density gradient. vWF multimer analysis of the starting material and vWF antigen containing fractions demonstrated a clear separation of the differently sized vWF multimers. The bulk of FVIII activity was found in the fractions composed of vWF dimer only. In all those fractions that not contained vWF dimer, FVIII activity was not measured. These data indicate that the binding protein for FVIII is the vWF-dimer. Moreover, ligand blot analysis of highly purified FVIII and electropboretically separated vWF-multimers showed exclusively binding of the FVIII molecule to the VWF dimer. Thus, the present data give clear evidence that the FVIII/vWF complex is formed between intact FVIII molecule and the dimeric form of vWF only.",

Recently, we demonstrated that plasma-derived VN specifically binds to human cultured endothelial cells and thereby promotes attachment and spreading of these cells to polystyrene petri dishes (Blood 71: 1581; 1988 ). In the present study we investigated whether VN may also promote the attachment of human endothelial and mesothelial cells to expanded polytetrafluorethylen (ePTFE) and polyurethane. ePTFE and polyurethane were passively precoated overnight with a solution of 25 ug/ml vitronectin, 25 ug/ml fibronectin and 0,2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Mesothelial cells derived from human omentum and endothelial cells isolated from human umbilical veins were seeded at a density of 2,4 x 105 cells/cm 2 and the extent of cell attachment was determined by light and scanning electron microscopy and by counting the cells after trypsinization. After 90 min more than 80% of the surface of ePTFE was covered with endothelial or mesothelial cells in the fibronectin and vitronectin coated wells, but the cells were more homogeneously distributed over the graft surface in the vitronectin coated wells. A monolayer of cells could not be achieved neither with fibronectin nor with vitronectin precoating on ePTFE after this time interval. In contrast to ePTFE, cells seeded on polyurethane pracoated with vitronectin and fibronectin formed a monolayer of ceils after this time interval. These data demonstrate that vitronectin can be used as a precoating substance for endothelial celt seeding on ePTFE and polyurethane.",

During fibrinolytic therapy a rise of FPA and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) has been observed. We investigated the in vitro effect of several plasminogen activators in high concentrations on citrated normal plasmas. The reagents used in final concentrations of 100.000 ul ml plasma were rt-PA (Actilyse Thomae, Biberach = 1 mg), prourokinase Sandoz/N~rnberg, Urokinase Deutsche Kabil-M~nchen, Streptokinase Behringwerke Marburg. rt-PA, prourokinase and urokinase had a low thrombinlike proteolyric activitiy when tested on the chromogenic substrate S-2ZSa, I00.000 u/ ml corresponding to 0.4-5 ulml, When added to plasma an effect was even noted for concentrations of 10.000 ulml for rt-PA and puk. With urokinase the effect was lesser visible. Streptokinase had no effect. At the same time a rise of FPA could be observed from about 10 ng/ml to 2000-3000 ng/ml for rt-PA, PUK and less with 1000 nglml for urokinase. Streptokinase induced a rise only about 50 ng/ml. At the same time the high concentrations of plasminogen activator, prourokinase and urokinase led to a loss of antithrombin activity of 30-50 % in plasma as well as in AT concentrate (Kybernin, Behringwerke) with a small rise of TAT.-This effect was again not noted with SK. -We conclude that several kind of plasminogen activators especially those with an affinity for fibrin have besides their fibrinolytic activity an additional but Lesser effect on the coagulation system.

A case of a three-year-old girl with reduced F VII-acti-vity (14.5-17%) and no hemorrhagic diathesis so far is reported. Because of a preoperative screening coagulation test for tonsillectomy, a F VII-deficiency was diagnosed. Although the child had shown no bleeding tendency so far, the child received PPSB; after therapy F VII-activity raised, however the PTT was now prolonged (78\"'). Finally after therapy with a F VII-concentrate alone a rise of F VIE-activity and prothrombine dime could be achieved without change of the PTT. It is postulated that the change of the PTT was caused by the heparin which is contained in the PPSB. Because PPSB contains less F VII-activity than a F VII-concentrate alone, the patient was given a high dosage of PPSB (20 U/ kg/12 hra) -which means he received more heparin than in a F VII-concentrate. We conclude that for a patient with an isolated F Vlldeficiency undergoing surgery a therapy with F VII-concentrate should be the therapy of the first choice. Significant difference between PC activity and antigen was found in 23 patients with proteinuria exceeding Ig/24 h and varying degree of renal insufficiency. PCI, ap-macroglobulin, urea and uremic toxins were investigated as a possible cause for this difference. Results showed a significant higher PCI in patients than in controis (p 0.001), but only a very weak inverse correlation to PC-activity. Elevated PCI due to enhanced liver synthesis in nephrotic syndrome seems unlikely since there was no correlation between PCI and cholinesterase. Neither uremic toxins nor urea nor a~-macroglobuIin were responsible for reduced PC-activity compared to the antigen. It is suggested that PCI may play an important role in exerting differences between functional and immunological PC. If elevated PCI participates on thrombogenesis in patients with high grade proteinuria with our data could not be shown. Phenprocoumon was administered to 10 healthy volunteers at a dosage of 15 and 12 mg in the first two days. Four of them received 1 mg vitamin K after 3 days. Bloc, d samples were drawn every 12 hours up to 7th day. Factor VII and protein C reached minimal levels of 10 to 15% during the third day. Concentrations (In mean) of thrombln-antithromblnitl-complexes (TAT) and flbrlnobeptld A (FPA) were markedly increased during the first two days whereas soluble flbdn remained within the normal range.

Concentrations were elevated during th~ first two days and subsequently fell to subnormal values Indicating the efficacy of the anticoagulant therapy. Two days after the last phenprocoumon administration, coagulation factors and protein C tended to normalize but In some courses TAT and FPA levels were increased again. This study provides Insights into the activation of the coagulation system : TAT and F1 +2 proved to be sensitive indicators of thrombln generation, which, however, due to the Inhibitory function of antithrombinlll, does not necessarily lead to an increased flbrlnogan-flbrln turnover with FPA release and formation of soluble fibrin. The measurement of TAT and In particular of F1 +2 may demonstrata a latent hypercoagulabllity even before fibrinogan-tumover is increased.",

R. Egbring, R. Seitz, L. Lerch, R. Wallin~ T. Saldeen* In acute inflammatory disorders granulocyte activation occur and lysosomal enzymes are released and normally inhibited by a2M and aIAT. If the inhibition is not sufficient fibrinogen may be degraded and Fps such as FpB~ 30-43 (FpB~) arise. In vitro FpB~ could be observed in aIAT deficient plasma (30% of normal) after addition of purified ELP of much lower concentrations as in normal plasma samples. Thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) elevation established intravascular thrombin formation and FpA and FpB are markers for the proteolytic activity of thrombin in vivo. ELP aIAT and FpBB and TAT elevation were determined in patients with bacterial infections, systemic hematological-, inflammatory bowel disease and disorders were PMNLS are activated. All these markers were elevated at various extent in o.m. patients and their discrimination enable conclusions which proteolytic reaction occur in inflammatory disorders, or if PMNL are activated otherwise. The decrease after treatment of the underlaying illness and plasma derivate substitution (AT III conc. and FFP) in several time courses had been a sure sign for successful treatment of DIC.

Kandt, J. Schrader, H. Kesterlng, F.

All the patients received an immunsuppraeaive therapy with Cycloaporln A and Cortlcosteroids. The average values of Cl-eaterase-inhlbitor did not change significantly during the first two days after sugery. Later, s noticable rise in the average values occurred. This rise was higher in patients with rejection reactions than in patients exhibiting no signs of organ rejection.

The following levels were measured in patients and controls: DVT patients: ACA IgG: median: 7.1U/ml, range: 1.0 to 100.0, ACA IgM: 2.6 U/ml, 0.0 to 60.0; controls: ACA IgG: 5.6, 1.1 to 30.0, ACA IgM: 2.3, O.O to ]3.8. 16 of 262 patients (6.1%) had elevated (> 99% percentile of healthy controls) ACA Ig levels (age of the first thrombotic event: median 28 years, range: 15 to 5g). Elevated ACA IgG levels were detected in 11 of 262 patients (= 4.2%), elevated ACA IgM levels in 8 of 262 patients (= 3.14). Both ACA IgG and IgM levels were elevated in 3 of 262 patients (= 1.2~). 6 of 11 patients with elevated ACA IgG had spontaneous DVT (152ga). At the time of investigation none of the patients had a history of arterial thrombotic disease. Two female patients had systemic lupus erythematodes: i of these patients had spontaneous DVT (22a; ACA IgM ~ ) and i suffered from DVT post partum (25a; ACA IgG ~ , IgM ~ ). The latter patient had lupus anticoagulant and the highest levels of ACA !gG (I00 U/ml) and A~ A IgM (60 U/ml). The present study confirms that elevated levels of ACA may be associated with venous thrombotic disease; this phenomenon is however relevant only in a small subgroup of DVT patients.First Dept. of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria 164 SENSITIVITY OF D-DIMER AND TAT MEASUREMENTS IN THE DIAGNO-STIC WORKUP OF THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE W.Speiser, Th. Leitha, R.Mallek, E.Minar, K.Lechner ..........................................................The sensitivity of elevated plasma levels of the activation markers of blood coagulation, thrombin-antithrombincomplex TAT, and fibrinolysis, fibrin split product D-Dimer, in the diagnostic workup of deep venous thrombosis DVT and pulmonary embolism PE was investigated. 34 consecutive patients with phlebographically documented proximal DVT and 26 consecutive patients with a high probability of PE in lung scan were included into the study. D-Dimer levels were determined by EIA (Agen Inc;, Parsippany, USA; elevated levels: >120 ng/ml = > mean + 2 S.D. of 45 healthy controls: 82\u00b119) and by Latex test(Dade, Miami, USA; positive test if levels exceed 500 ng/ml). TAT levels were determined by EIA (Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG; elevated levels: > 5.4 ng/ml : > mean + 2 S.D. of 45 healthy controls: 3.4\u00b11.0). Sensitivity of D-Dimer EIA measurements, D-Dimer Latex test and TAT measurements in DVT patients during the first week of symptoms: i, i, 0.88; during the second week of symptoms: i, 0.33, 0.66. Sensitivity of D-Dimer EIA measurements, D~Dimer Latex test and TAT EIA measurements in PE patients: 0.85, 0.46, 0.54. We conclude from our results: i) Due to high sensitivity D-Dimer EIA can be used as a screening test in patients with suspected proximal DVT during a period of two weeks after the onset of symptoms and D-Dimer Latex test can be used in proximal DVT patients if the duration of symptoms does not exceed one week. 2) In PE patients b-Dimer EIA can be recommended for the diagnostic workup, especially in patients with inconclusive lung scan. 3) TAT measurements show markedly lower sensitivities in the diagnosis of DVT and PE than D-Dimer measurements. First Dept. of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria High Evidence for a Second (Hydrophobic) Binding Region in Plasminogen Activator/ Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Interaction T.W. STIEF, J. DIGON, A. ESPIGADO, R. PARODY, E. MARTIN, J.M. RODRIQUEZ Dept. of Haematology, Section of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, General Hospital \"Virgen del Rocio\", University of Seville, E-41013 Seville, SpainPlasminogen activators interact with fast acting plasminogen activator inhibitore at second order rase constants (kt) in the range of 10 z l mo1-1 s -~ . In this study it has been demonstrated that in the presence of hydrophobic agents, such as poly ethylene glycol or Triton X 100 T.M., the apparent second order rate constants fall drastically in a hydrophobic agent-concentration dependent manner. In addition, urokinase bound to plastic plates becomes to about 45 % refractory to inhibition by PAI, interestingly without any lOBs in catalytic activity against plasminogen. Thus, there is high evidence that beside the reactive caDtre a second (hydrophobic) binding region seems to be involved in PA/ PAI interaction.Human macrophages and granulocytes participate in physiologic fibrinolysis. Membrane proteins include u-PA and plasminogen receptors. Interaction of u-PA with its receptor results in PAI uncontrolled PA activity allowing the creation of microcomparmments of enhanced flbrinolytic activity.The mechanism for this PA/ PA receptor in~eraction might involve the hydrophobic binding region of the PA molecule.167 H.-J.

The patients (15 female, 12 male) had a mean age of 65 years and were on HD for 5,7 years. 5 patients died during the study and one was transplanted. LMWH was given initially at a 60% dose of previous UFH requirement and subsequently adjusted according to AP'I-r and thrombin time (l-r) values. Several assays were performed prior to, 30 rain and after HD including: AP13-, \"IT, anti-Xa, anti-Ila (Boehringer, Mannbeim), t-PA and PAl-1 (Biopool, Umea), von Willebrand factor antigen (Boehringer, Mannheim) and factor VIII:C antigen.A mean heparin dose of 4958 U (UFH) vs. 4216 U (LMWH) was given per dialysis. Mean APTT (Boehdnger, Mannbeim) values before HD were 33.8 s and 33.9 s, and after HD were 49.9 and 46.3 s for UFH and LMWH, respectively. Significant correlations between chromogenic substrata anti-Xa assay (Ka-bWitrum) and Heptest (Haemachem, St.Louis) were observed during UFH (r=0.71) and LMWH (r=0.72). The correlation between APTT and anti-Xawas r= 0.62 for UFH, but only r= 0.27 for LMWH. Factor vIn:CAg decreased during LMWH treatment (425_+ 151 to 317_+ 260 U/dl), but remained constant during UFH (313_+122 and 292_+144 U/dl). Mean platelet count showed no differences during LMWH (228_+84x 1000/ul) or UFH (220+89 x 1000/ul) treatment. Transfusion requirements were 1.59 _+ 2.62 U and 1.6 -+ 1.44 U red cells during UFH and LMWH treatment, respectively. Shunt thromboses were observed in 1 (UFH) and 3 (LMWH) patients. Our data confirm earlier findings that LMWH may be used as an anticoagulant for HD, however, dose finding, drug monitoring and possible advantages have to be investigated and confirmed in further studies.Abteilung for Klinische H~mostaseologie und Transfusionsmedizin und Abteilung for Dialyse und Nephrologie der Universitt=t des Saarlandes, D-6650 Homburg/Saar, F.R.G.",

            "text": "a-2-Macroglobulin (a2M) is a proteinase inhibitor of broad specificity and one of the major plasma proteins in man. Monocytes interact with azM-proteinase complexes internalising and degrading them. Since activated leukocytes (PMN) release large amounts of reactive oxidants the goal of this study was to determine whether these agents are able to inactivate the inhibitor. Mimicking the leukocyte attack in normal human plasma by N-chleramines we observed an oxidant concentration dependent inactivating effect on purified and plasma azM. The oxidant concentration for complete inactivation of the inhibitor was found to be comparable w i t h the \"lethal\" dose for human a-2-antiplasmin and antithrombin I I I . The inactivation of a2M by oxidants is the result of a specific oxidative damage since the corresponding serine proteases as well as CI-inhibitor were chloramine resistant under the conditions used. I t might be speculated that the oxidants attack the bait region of the trap molecule a2M. According to our results, the amount of oxidants released by I x 10 ~ activated P M N would be sufficient to destroy azM activity of about I Nl of human plasma. Consequently, in local areas of inflammation activated leukocytes may well be able to create microcompartments of uncontrolled protease activity by generation of reactive oxidants.Oxidants seem to alter enzyme/ inhibitor balances in favour of the enzyme.Univ. Department of Hematology, Section of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, General Hospital \"Virgen del Roche\", University of Seville, E-41013 Seville, Spain Shape change (1), internalization of surface-bound iigands (2) and the exocytosJs of secretory organelles (3) characterize stimulated platelets. These reactions involve membrane rearrangements and the action of the contractile cytoskeleton and appear to run off simultaneously within the first seconds of activation. To study the earliest structural dynamic processes during activation the platelets were stimulated for 10 up to 60 seconds with thrombin or collagen and than chemically fixed or -for demonstration of membrane fusion -rapidly frozen (impact freezing) and freezesubstituted. Using electron micregraphs from serial sections the structural alterations were reconstructed. (1) Within the first seconds of piatelet stimulation the membranes of the \"surface connected system\" were evaginated for the purpose of surface enlargement required to change shape. (2) Simultaneously, the plateJets started to internalize surface areas with bound ligands. The plasmalemmaJ invaginations were observed attached to the contractile get and thus they followed the centripetally moving constriction. This could be demonstrated for several surface bound ligands as cationized ferritin, fibrin as weJI as collagen fibers. The internalization of fibrillar ligands by platelets in this mode caused the retraction of fibers. (3) Within the first seconds after stimulation the membranes of the secretory organel]es form appositions to the plasmalemma or to membranes of the SCS and seemed to maintain this position during shape change and interna] contraction. The exocytosis started after formation of a fusion pore and was then continued by compound exocytosis of secretory granules. The observed membrane rearrangement may explain how piatelets are able to carry out their different actions (shape change, surface-ligand interaction, release reaction and retraction) within a short period of time. Thereby, a retrieval of membranes and integrated components seems to occur. In recent years the knowdlege on the regulation of the fibrinolytic system has substantially increased. Several clinical conditions have been associated with alterations of the fibrinolytic system in plasma. However, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from the laboratory data obtained as the plasma levels of several components of the fibrinolytic system, such as tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAl-l), are influenced by diurnal variation, age, exercise, stress, nutrition. In order to study the fibrinolytic system in plasma, it is necessary to standardize influencial factors. We designed a highly standardized procedure for the investigation of the fibrinolytic system in plasma. Ten healthy volunteers were investigated three times, with a minimal interval of 7 days between each examination. Blood was withdrawn under fasting conditions in the morning between 7.30 and 9.00 a.m., after a resting period of 20 minutes, before and after 10 minutes of venous occlusion (VO). In order to evaluate the day to day variation, the coefficient of variation (CV) was estimated for each parameter before and after VO. The mean CV for the eug!obulin lysis time was 9.5% before VO and 9.3% after VO. The CVs for tPA were 14.4% and 27.0% before and after VO, respectively. PAl-1 antigen showed a CV of 10.5% before and 19.0% after VO, and the CV for PAl-capacity were 5.0% before and 33.0% after VO. There was a significant correlation between PAl-1 antigen and PAl.capacity before and after VO (r=0.64, p<0.0001, and r=0.72, p<0.0001). These data indicate that the day to day variations in parameters of the fibrinolytic system can be kept within a low range, provided a highly standardized procedure is chosen for blood withdrawal MPG-Clinical Research Unit for Blood Coagulation and Thrombosis, D-6300 Giessen, and Department of Internal Medicine II, Hassenklinik, D-6330 Wetzlar.",

In eleven healthy young subjects the effects of a short exhaustive bicycle exercise were examined on thrombin-antithrombin III komplex, tissue-plasminogen activator, complement fragments C3a and C4a and histamin in the blood. The analyses were carried out thirty minutes before and immediately before exercise, immediately post-exercise and thirty and sixty minutes later. As evaluated from the percentage change of haemoglobin and haematocrit, the plasma volume did not change significantly after the exercise test. Immediately postexercise thrombin -antithrombin III, tissueplasminogen activator, complement fragments C3a and C4a and histamin were all significantly elevated (p < 0.01) compared with the pre-exercise values. Thirty and sixty minutes later the values normalized and significant differences with the pre-exercise values could no longer be measured.The present results support the concept of an activation in vivo of coagulation, fibrinolysis as well as of the complement system after short maximal exercise.",

One of the causes may be hyperfibrinolysis.Activity and antigen of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA; tPA-Ag), activities of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and \"intrinsic plasminogen activators\" (iPA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator antigen (uPA-Ag) as well as thrombelastography (TEG) and further parameters of plasmatic coagulation were monitored in the course of 9 consecutive OLTs (table). Our data confirm previous results that indica\u00a3e hyperfibrinolysis developping during the anhepatic stage (a.st.) and peaking in the early reperfusion (rep.) period mostly due to tPA increase. In addition intrinsic fibrinolytic activity may be involved. We believe that antifibrinolytic therapy may be indicated in OLT.

MoAB #394 in combination with the bi0tinylated meAB #377 was applied to quantitate various forms of nrokinase by FLISA. As verified by Western bi0t analysis, m0AB #377 and #394 bind to the pr0enzyme form (pr0-uPA), the high and 10w molecular weight form of uPA (HMW-uPA, LMW-uPA). MOAB #377 is directed to an epit0pe on the A-chain of uPA whereas #394 detects an epit0pe on the B-chain.

            "text": "Turbidimetric measurements of platelet function lack a reference with which different instruments and procedures could be standardized. As a consequence, quantitative results strongly depend on the type of the aggregometer, the mode of its adjustment and cannot be directly compared between different laboratories. We present a method of a standardization that refers to the platelet concentration. It is based on a linear relationship between the signal measured and the platelet concentration. We developed a computer-assisted universal aggregometer in which the range is adjusted with a dispersion of definite t u r b i d i t y and the platelet-suspending medium, the transmission is transformed into absorbance and the still remaining deviations from a line are corrected by software-assisted calibration.The calibration can be stored for different platelet preparations and even different cell species, e.g. neutrophils, and is reused for different samples and preparations. With that calibration, any phenomenon of piatelet activation which is turbidimetrically monitored can be referred to an actual (in aggregation measurements) or pseudo (in shape change or secretion measurements) percentual change in platelet concentration. This procedure also strongly increase the sensitivity and accuracy with which small changes in the t u r b i d i t y during weak aggregation, shape change or alpha-granule secretion can be reliably measured. The computer software provides on line monitoring of the signals from 4 aggregometer channels and calculates the final results. The instrument works with platelet concentrations between 0.5 and 8 x 108/rnl. An universal interface can also be connected to the analogous exit of any conventional aggregometer. ( Fla.,1984) . Un~l now a viral transmission was easily detected by screening tests for HBV or HIV, but NANB hepafifis could only he excluded by surrogate tests. Now we have the possibility to prove a NANBV transmission by detection of anfi HCV with the second generation \"ortho-HCV\" enzyme linked immunceorbent assay (ELISA) developed by Ortho Diagnosfi~, New Jersey. A further criterion for safety is the Inactivation of parvovirus B19, because this virus is designated as one of the most thermoresistaet viruses in blood products. Anti HCV tests and anti B 19 tests were conducted in three groups of *virgin\" patients, who were exclusively treated with defined concentrates: Group 1) 49 haemophilia A patients, who were treated since 1980 with a pasteurized factor Viii concentrate, heated in aqueous solufion at 60 o C for 10 hours (Heamate \u00ae HS, Behringwerke Marburg).

In this context, special interest was devoted to the influence of hirudin on the clinically relevant endotoxin-induced localized or generalized microthrombosis. The generalized form known as Shwartzman reaction (GSR) was induced by endotoxin infusion (2.5 mg/kg x h)in young pigs. The localized Shwartzman reaction (LSR) was induced by intradermal application of endotoxin in rabbits, followed by intravenous provocative injection of endotoxin on the next day. To detect f i b [~ deposits the animais were pretreated with ~ ~I-fibrinogen and the accumulation of radioactivity was measured with a gamma c o u~ ter. When hirudin (0.05 mg/kg x h)waa given,the endotoxin-induced consumption of clotting factors which is typical of GSR was less pronounced and the number of fibrin deposits in the lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen was diminished. The increase in the right ventricular pressure was delayed. The animals survived the otherwise lethal endotoxin infusion. Compared to hirudin, heparin (0.5, i or 2 mg/kg x h) could not prevent the endotoxin-induced changes and the an9 mals died during the endotoxin infusion. Hirudin prevented also the development of the LSR. Fibrin accumulation in the skin area and the haemorrhagic-necrotic reaction were suppressed by hirudin (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) 30 min prior to the provocative endotoxin injection.Institut for Pharmakologie und Toxikologie der Medizinischen Akademie Erfurt, Nordh~user Str.

Therefore, the availability of easily measurable plasma parameters predicting a forthcoming organ complication as early as possible is urgently needed. In this respect we evaluated the predictive value of the hemostatic parameters prothrombin, antithrombin III, plasminogen, O62-antiplasmin , prokallikrein and C1-inactivafor [either separately or summarized in the PFI-index according to AASEN) in a prospective study on 69 polytraumized patients (Injury Severity Score > 30 points). In addition, we studied factor VIII antigen as well as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), t-PA inhibitor I and D-dimers. During the observation period (usually 14 days) 11 patients developed lethal MOF, 29 patients overcame reversible organ failure and 29 patients did not show signs of organ dysfunction. At the time of admission to the hospital (mean value: 49 min post trauma) AT III, prothrombin, D-dimems and t-PA indicated the development of later organ failure with specificities and positive predictive values above 60 %. All other parameters did not behave as clinically relevant prognostic factors in this respect. Moreover, the data of AT III and ~2-antiplasmin at the time of admission allowed a clear differentiation between patients who died and those who overcame the traumatic events. From the 4th posttraumatic day onwards also the PFIindex indicated the later outcome with a sensitivity and a specificity value above 60 %.1~t. Klin.Chemie u.Kli~.Biochemie in der 2Chirurg.
