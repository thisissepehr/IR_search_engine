When DNA was discovered to be the material basis of inheritance in all organisms, it was thought that the DNA content of an organism should correlate with its phenotypic complexity, but soon thereafter the C-value paradox was found. C-value refers to the amount of DNA contained within a haploid nucleus, and usually equals to genome size. Salamanders and lungfishes have the largest genomes of 120pg, while the C-value of humans is only 3.5pg [1] . C-values vary enormously among species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold. Variation in C-values bears no relationship to the complexity of the organism. The discovery of non-coding DNA in the early 1970 s resolved the C-value paradox. Although it is still unclear why some species have a remarkably higher amount of non-coding sequences than others of the same level of complexity, it was believed that the number of genes contained in the genome, rather than the genome size, correlated with the complexity of the organism. However, the human genome project and other model organism genome projects revealed that there are only about 25,000 genes in the human genome [2] , while simple organism nematode have 19,500 genes [3] and rice even has more genes than humans, 46,000~55,000 [4] .

The study of proteomics proceeds extensively after the genome projects. However, proteins are different from nucleic acids. Many proteins are subjected to a wide variety of chemical modifications after translation. A lot of these post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, nitrosylation and protein splicing, are critical to the protein functions. The modified proteins display different physical and chemical properties and biological functions from the unmodified. If a modified protein can be seen as a new protein, then the size of the proteome would be much larger than the number of genes. The number of proteins in a living organism may never be accurately counted as the number of genes, because every modified protein can only be individually studied. That is technically much more difficult because different proteins have different properties. A proteomic study can become quite complex even if the object of the study is very restricted.

The traditional mathematical notion of complexity is Kolmogorov complexity, which can be thought of as the length of the shortest message in which the given sequence can be encoded [5] . The complexity is minimal for a homopolymer, and is maximal for a random sequence, in which case complexity is equal to the sequence length. The later case means the sequence cannot be simplified at all, so is the most complex. However, Kolmogorov complexity does not correspond to our intuitive notion of biological complexity. The other complexity is to calculate the Shannon's information entropy of a sequence [5] [6] [7] [8] . The complexity is the length of the sequence subtracting the Shannon's entropy, and is actually the information content of the sequence. This kind of complexity has biological meaning. The more complex means the sequence is more conserved and therefore carries more information.

The phenotypic complexity of an organism is a measure of uncertainty associated with the size of the genome sequence, and is mathematically defined as the information entropy of the system. The amount of effective genomic information needed to produce a gene/protein sequences from a random sequence is at least the information entropy. The approach uses permutation and combination formulas to model the information needed to encode proteins for simple organisms like viruses, bacteria and other single celled organisms; and also extends the method to compute the information needed to produce differentiated cells and to construct spatial structures formed by the cells in higher organisms. The approach is not without interest, but several questions need to be addressed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Reviewers' comments"}, {"text": "1.

In p.4: \\...there are no regulations of quantity of gene products.

But is this relevant for computing complexity? in p. 5:\\In fact, mutations are not normally allowed for a real protein sequence\" -not true, viruses are notorious for rapid evolution that is facilitated, in the case of RNA viruses, by a particularly high mutation rate (but again, is this information even needed for what authors are proposing?).

For instance, the effective information for the eukaryotes is calculated as sum of Shannon entropies corresponding to information needed (1) to encode all proteins, (2) to produce all he differentiated cells, and (3) to construct the spatial structure. For the three organisms (viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes) considered in the paper, the effective information is shown to be increasing in the order from virus to bacteria and to eukaryotes. What the authors had done is to use Sharron's information entropies to represent genotypic complexity on the three organisms but failed to demonstrate the relevance of this information to the evolution of phenotypic complexity. It should be noted that the scalability of genotypic complexity does not automatically lead to the scalability of phenotypic complexity that is not defined in the paper.Here are my specific comments: 1. A logical framework must be constructed so that the information on genotypic complexity as measured by Shannon's information entropies can be used to support the evolution of phenotypic complexity. This framework should be equally applicable to either the entire universe of organisms or only to a single organism such as eukaryotes. The authors may first focus on one organism and then apply the methodology to a broader subgroup of organisms if not the whole universe of organisms. An interesting work on phenotypic complexity is by Lehere and Haddow [27] in which mapping of genotypic complexity to phenotypic complexity was considered.2. In view of the comment #1 above, it is logical to consolidate all equations that are now scattering over three sections into a single section of method and/or theory. In other words, the metric on genotypic and phenotypic domains must be well defined first before any evolutionary claim could be made. Some formality on how these equations are derived should be presented. For instance, it would be more appropriate to define a1 along with a2, a3,..., acn, rather than skiping a1 and replace it by t (the averaged size of cellular proteome of differentiated cells) as shown in the section \"The calculation of effective information of eukaryotes\". While the calculated result will be the same, it is desirable to have some formality in presentation to avoid misunderstanding from readers. For instance, one may question the meaningfulness of the term (choosing t from x) when t is not an integer.3. Another loose end of the manuscript is the lack of a well-defined universe from which representative samples are taken and the inference made. The scope of organisms to be inferred must be clearly defined; otherwise, the conclusion of the paper could be predetermined simply by the choice of database and the methodology. A biologist may argue that there is always an increase in complexity if one follows the simple dictum that eggs come from preexisting eggs and multicellular organism evolves from single cell animals. Questions can then be Authors' contributions YJ proposed the ideas, conducted the calculations, and wrote the manuscript.
