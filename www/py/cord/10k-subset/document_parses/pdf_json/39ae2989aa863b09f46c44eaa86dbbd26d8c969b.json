Design and setting: Prospective observational study in a medical ICU of a university hospital. Patients: Twenty consecutive patients with septic shock and a cardiac index of 3.5 l/min or higher, started on \u00aalow-dose\u00ba hydrocortisone therapy (100 mg bolus, 10 mg/h for 7 days and subsequent tapering) within 72 h of the onset of shock. Measurements and results: Basal total and free plasma cortisol levels ranged from 203 to 2169 and from 17 to 372 nmol/l. In 11 patients cortisol production was considered \u00aainadequate\u00ba because there was neither a response to ACTH of at least 200 nmol/l nor a baseline level of at least 1000 nmol/l. Following the initiation of hydrocortisone therapy total and free cortisol levels in-creased 4.2-and 8.5-fold to median levels of 3587 (interquartile range 2679\u00b15220) and 1210 (interquartile range 750\u00b11846) nmol/l on day 1, and thereafter declined to median levels of 1310 nmol/l and 345 nmol/l on day 7. Patients with \u00aainadequate\u00ba steroid production could be weaned from vasopressor therapy significantly faster, although their plasma free cortisol concentrations during the hydrocortisone treatment period did not differ. Conclusions: (a) During proposed regimens of \u00aalow-dose\u00ba hydrocortisone therapy, initially achieved plasma cortisol concentrations considerably exceed basal and ACTH stimulated levels. (b) Cortisol concentrations decline subsequently, despite continuous application of a constant dose. (c) \u00aaInadequate\u00ba endogenous steroid production appears to sensitize patients to the hemodynamic effects of a \u00aatherapeutic rise\u00ba in plasma cortisol levels.",

            "text": "adrenal insufficiency per se can lead to a high output circulatory failure that resembles septic shock [3] . In addition, animal experiments [4] and clinical observations [5, 6, 7, 8] have shown that diminished steroid levels during sepsis are associated with adverse prognosis. In experimental settings in humans the administration of hydrocortisone before or during endotoxin challenge significantly reduces the inflammatory response [9] . On the other hand, some studies have shown that mortality is higher with increased levels of cortisol in patients with sepsis and septic shock [10, 11] . A recent prospective cohort study in 189 patients with septic shock found that patients with high cortisol levels and a reduced response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, corticotropin) have the worst outcome [12] .",

As shown in Table 4 , the only detectable difference between patients with and without rapid weaning from catecholamines was their endogenous cortisol production; 11 of 14 patients with rapid hemodynamic improvement, but none of the 6 patients with continued high catecholamine dependence, showed inadequate endogenous cortisol production. Accordingly, free and total cortisol levels before the initiation of hydrocortisone therapy in patients with early improvement were significantly lower.

            "text": "This study confirms that endogenous plasma cortisol concentrations are increased in patients with septic shock, but that the degree of increase is highly variable. Only one of 20 patients had a post-ACTH cortisol plasma level less than 500 nmol/l, which supports the concept that absolute adrenocortical deficiency is rare in critically ill patients [5, 6, 7, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] . Whether increases in cortisol levels are appropriate for the severity of illness or reflect functional hypoadrenalism is less clear. The rapid ACTH test is widely used as a simple method to identify adrenocortical hyporesponsiveness, but controversy exists as to how diagnostic criteria should be derived from the basal cortisol level, the stimulated cortisol level or their difference [24] . Three [6, 7, 32] of four previous studies [6, 7, 28, 32] using a rapid ACTH test to investigate adrenocortical function in septic shock used an increment of at least 200\u00b1250 nmol/l to define \u00aaadequate\u00ba responsiveness. However, in healthy controls, large unselected patient populations and also in patients with septic shock [7, 24] (Table 1) cortisol increments are inversely related to basal levels. As discussed previously [24, 29, 31, 33, 34] , it appears likely that disproportionately low increments from high basal cortisol concentrations are due to maximal endogenous ACTH and therefore not indicative of adrenocorticoid hyporesponsiveness. We have thus arbitrarily defined endogenous cortisol production as \u00aaadequate\u00ba in patients not only when they responded significantly to ACTH, but also when their baseline level was above 1000 nmol/l. Using these criteria endogenous cortisol production appeared to be \u00aainadequate\u00ba in approximately one-half of our patients. It should be noted, however, that an elevation in plasma cortisol levels above 1000 nmol/l in septic patients may reflect not only increased production but could also indicate decreased hepatic cortisol clearance [35, 36] . Following cortisol therapy with a similar dose as in previous trials (340 mg/day) [18, 19, 20, 21 ], peak concentrations of total cortisol were almost threefold higher than the post-ACTH level in patients considered to have an \u00aaadequate\u00ba endogenous response. These peak concentrations corresponded to a 6.2-fold and 9.1-fold increase in free cortisol concentrations in patients with and without \u00aaadequate\u00ba endogenous production. Clearly therefore this dose must be considered as supraphysiological. Interestingly, although the median total cortisol level remained above 1000 nmol/l thereafter, the levels of both total and free cortisol declined progressively during the course of therapy despite the administration of a constant dose of 10 mg/h. A similar, albeit less pronounced reduction in cortisol levels during \u00aalow-dose\u00ba hydrocortisone therapy has also been reported by Briegel et al. [22] . However, in this study the dose was tapered after only 1\u00b15 days. Therefore, in contrast to our observations, the decline could be attributed to the reduction in steroid dose. Even if one assumes that in the present investigation the administration of ACTH and the initial bolus injection of 100 mg contributed to the peak concentration on day 1, and that endogenous cortisol production was subsequently suppressed, these two effects cannot entirely explain the reduction in median level from 3587 to 1310 nmol/l between days 1 and 7. Moreover, it has been shown that cortisol production in septic shock is in fact not suppressible by steroids [34] . It is possible therefore that the metabolism of hydrocortisone changes during the treatment period. Earlier studies have shown that cortisol extraction from blood is decreased, and that its half-life is prolonged during septic shock [35, 36] . The observed decline in cortisol levels during the treatment period could reflect a reversal of these alterations.",

It is nevertheless noteworthy that inotropes could be reduced rather quickly after initiation of the hydrocortisone infusion. The reduction in catecholamine dose was comparable [21] or even faster than in previous studies using similar doses of cortisol [18, 20] , which may be related to the fact that we started therapy earlier during the septic course. In contrast to previous reports [6, 7, 28], mortality in patients with \u00aainadequate\u00ba endogenous cortisol was not higher (Table 2) , and survivors and nonsurvivors did not have significantly different steroid levels Fig. 2 Time course of noradrenaline needs in patients with and without adequate endogenous cortisol production (CP). Two days after the beginning of \u00aalow-dose\u00ba hydrocortisone therapy patients with inadequate endogenous production needed significantly less vasopressor support before hydrocortisone therapy. This observation is in accordance with the results of a recent randomized controlled trial by Bollaert et al. [20] and is compatible with the growing evidence that \u00aalow-dose\u00ba therapy reverses the putative adverse risk factor of inappropriate cortisol production [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] .",

In addition, the only detectable difference between patients with and without rapid hemodynamic improvement was their basal cortisol status (Table 4) . Similarly Brie-gel et al. [18] found that 6 of 14 patients weaned from catecholamines within 48 h of hydrocortisone therapy had lower cortisol levels before steroid treatment. In addition, Annane et al. [32] reported that patients in septic shock with inadequate as compared to adequate cortisol production had lower baseline responsiveness to noradrenaline but showed a more marked improvement in vasopressor sensitivity in response to hydrocortisone bolus. It appears therefore that the greatest benefit of hydrocortisone therapy is achieved in patients with blunted endogenous production, although the exact mechanisms of this sensitization remain to be elucidated. In contrast to the hemodynamic changes the febrile response and the course of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels or white blood cell counts did not depend on the pretreatment cortisol production (Table 3) . Thus, although it has been suggested that hydrocortisone treatment reduces indicators of the acute-phase response [22] , these effects appear not to be directly related to the hemodynamic effects. We also found no association between the hemodynamic response and survival rates (Table 4 ), but larger controlled trials are necessary to exclude or verify effects on such outcome parameters.",

Firstly, during proposed regimes of \u00aalow-dose\u00ba hydrocortisone therapy plasma cortisol concentrations are achieved initially which considerably exceed basal and ACTH stimulated levels. Thus in order to achieve a substitution of deficient endogenous production, doses even lower than those used so far may be sufficient. Secondly, during continuous administration of hydrocortisone, cortisol levels decline, suggesting that changes in cortisol metabolism have a significant impact on its plasma concentration. Thirdly, \u00aainadequate\u00ba endogenous steroid production appears to sensitize patients to the hemodynamic effects of a rise in plasma cortisol levels. ",
