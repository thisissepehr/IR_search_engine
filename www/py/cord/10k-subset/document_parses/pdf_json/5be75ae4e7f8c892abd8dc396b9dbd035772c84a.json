A survey was conducted to assess the intensive care physicians' perception of the AMR situation in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). Methods: Between May and July 2017, physicians working in European ICUs were invited to complete an online questionnaire hosted by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The survey included 20 questions on hospital and ICU characteristics, frequency of infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and relevance of AMR in the respondent's ICU, management of antimicrobial treatment as well as the use of last-line antibiotics in the six months preceding the survey. For the analysis of regional differences, EU/EEA countries were grouped into the four sub-regions of Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Europe. Results: Overall, 1062 responses from four European sub-regions were analysed. Infections with MDR bacteria in their ICU were rated as a major problem by 257 (24.2%), moderate problem by 360 (33.9%) and minor problem by 391 (36.8%) respondents. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently encountered MDR bacteria followed by, in order of decreasing frequency, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Perception of the relevance of the AMR problem and the frequency of specific MDR bacteria varied by European sub-region. Bacteria resistant to all or almost all available antibiotics were encountered by 132 (12.4%) respondents. Many physicians reported not having access to specific last-line antibiotics. Conclusions: The percentage of European ICU physicians perceiving AMR as a substantial problem in their ICU is high with variation by sub-region in line with epidemiological studies.

ICUs are particularly exposed to AMR. This is due to the specific population of patients cared for in ICUs that accumulate factors known to increase the AMR risk as ICUs combine a high frequency of patients under antimicrobial treatment, a high intensity of care with numerous invasive devices, and a concentration of severely ill patients with multiple previous hospital stays and previous exposures to antibiotics [12] . The substantial proportion (12.4%) of ICU physicians who reported that they had, during the preceding six months, at least one patient with an infection caused by a bacterium resistant to all or almost all antibiotics available in their ICU is of concern. This is an indication that ICU physicians are already encountering situations where options for effective treatment of infections are very limited. We analyzed the results by European sub-region to take into account that the epidemiology of AMR as described, for example, in the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance-Network (EARS-Net) reports [5] , and of antibiotic consumption as reported from ESAC-Net [2] are largely heterogeneous in the EU/EEA. In 2016, EARS-Net reported a wide variation in AMR depending on the bacterial species and the geographical region with higher percentages of AMR being reported by countries in Southern and Eastern Europe. Our multivariate analysis of factors influencing the perception of AMR confirmed the role of the European sub-region, with ICU physicians in Eastern and Southern sub-regions more frequently ranking MDR bacteria in their ICU as a major problem. The other factors significantly associated, in the multivariate analysis, with a higher ranking of perception of AMR as a problem were related to (a) the number of admissions and the type of ICU, which are likely proxies for patient populations with different risks for infection with MDR bacteria, and (b) the lack of protocols for empiric treatment, which might be a sign of the absence of antibiotic stewardship activities that could improve antibiotic prescribing and control of MDR bacteria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 589, "end": 593, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1208, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1270, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The EARS-Net report also highlighted a high level of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae which was reported in our survey as the most frequently encountered type of MDR bacteria in ICUs in the EU/EEA.

Firstly, it confirmed the lack of availability of older antibiotics in several EU/EEA countries, as already raised by other studies [14, 15] . In particular, colistin and temocillin were not available in all EU/EEA countries [15, 16] . Secondly, our study showed that the recently approved cephalosporin-betalactamase inhibitor combinations targeting infections with resistant Gram-negative bacteria: ceftolozanetazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, that received marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union in 2015 and 2016, respectively [17, 18] , were not always available in ICUs in EU/EEA countries. However, we were not able to differentiate between nonavailability of these antibiotics at national level or at hospital level (e.g. because of cost or organizational reasons). We also did not assess whether availability meant rapid availability from the pharmacy or whether lastline antibiotics had to be ordered from other providers or countries with a delay that may impact appropriate management of severely ill ICU patients. Many respondents mentioned carbapenems in the category 'other' last-line antibiotics (data not shown), although they were not included in our list of proposed last-line antibiotics. This is an indication that carbapenems are still considered as last-line antibiotics by many ICU physicians in the EU/EEA. A previous survey designed by ECDC, the European Medicines Agency and ESICM among European intensive care physicians with partially comparable, but not identical questions and only 95 respondents was published in 2009 [4] . Some results were similar in both surveys. For example, MRSA and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently reported MDR bacteria in 2009 and in 2017. However, there were differences in the scale used to measure the perception of AMR, which prevents more detailed comparisons. In 2009, 50 (53%) respondents declared having treated at least one patient with a bacterium totally or almost totally resistant to available antibiotics during the preceding six months, which is a higher percentage than the result of the 2017 survey (12.4%). This might be explained by the much lower number of respondents and possible selection bias of these respondents in 2009 as well as possibly by a changing perception, among ICU physicians, of what constitutes \"totally or almost totally resistant\" and should therefore be interpreted with caution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 223, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 224, "end": 227, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 312, "end": 316, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 642, "end": 646, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 647, "end": 650, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1664, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To our knowledge, similar European-wide surveys have not recently been performed among ICU physicians.

The preferred option was \"faster/better microbiological diagnostic tools\". This is not surprising in the ICU context where the timely replacement of an empiric antibiotic regimen with targeted treatment is of utmost importance. New diagnostic tests are under development, but there might be barriers to their use, often related to costs [28] . Furthermore, the correct use of these new tests is important and, as stated by Messacar et al. [29] , diagnostic stewardship is required to direct the appropriate tests to the right patient. \"Opportunities for training/education of clinicians for better use of existing antibiotics\" was the option ranked second by the respondents, while \"new antibiotics\" was only ranked fifth suggesting that ICU physicians have more trust in antibiotic stewardship and better targeted use of existing antibiotics than in new antibiotics that might possibly become available in the future [30, 31] . The fact that \"more resources for infection control\" was ranked third is encouraging, as this indicates that ICU physicians are aware of the close relationship between crosstransmission, ICU acquired-infections and antimicrobial use and that AMR cannot be controlled without the implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures and the involvement of ICU physicians in such activities. An interesting example of such involvement is the control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Israel by a national intervention [32] . \"More opportunity for specialist consultation\" was ranked as the least preferred option, indicating that ICU physicians (or at least the respondents to our survey) have sufficient access to infectious disease specialists or consider that their level of competence allows them to manage antimicrobial treatment in severely ill patients. The strength of this study is its relatively large number of responses from the target group of ICU physicians who are prescribing antibiotics and its ability to provide European sub-region-specific results. This survey has, however, several limitations. Firstly, the results were based on a non-random sample of respondents and a response rate could not be calculated. Given the dissemination strategy, specific categories of ICUs or ICU physicians, especially those with interest in AMR may have been overrepresented. Secondly, we do not know how many ICUs are represented by the respondents as no information allowing the identification of ICUs was collected to maintain the confidentiality of respondents. Thirdly, grouping countries into four regions may mask differences between countries and we were not able to provide results by country due to differences in the number of replies by country.
