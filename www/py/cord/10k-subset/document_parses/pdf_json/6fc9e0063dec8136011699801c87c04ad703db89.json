Of the 3 influenza virus genera (A-C), influenza A is generally associated with more severe disease and is further subtyped by 2 surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Various combinations of the 16 HA (2 phylogenetic groups) and 9 NA subtypes define all subtypes of influenza A viruses. The Group 1 HA subtypes are H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16; the Group 2 HA subtypes are H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15. Seasonal viruses, such as influenza A H1N1 (Group 1) and H3N2 (Group 2), and influenza B viruses cause infection in 5%-15% of the population worldwide and 250,000-500,000 deaths annually. In addition to frequent annual epidemics, influenza viruses periodically cause pandemics, the most recent example being the 2009 pandemic caused by the swine-origin H1N1/2009 influenza virus.",

            "text": "Vaccination is the principle means of preventing seasonal and pandemic influenza and it's complications. A universal vaccine that induces broad immunity against multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses is a long-sought goal in medical research. Recently, we and others identified a family of human broadly neutralizing ''heterosubtypic'' antibodies (BnAbs) that bind to a highly conserved pocket on the stem of HA present in all Group 1 influenza viruses [1, 2] and block virus-host cell membrane fusion. These BnAbs were identified by recombinant H5 panning from antibody (Ab)-phage libraries that are constructed from nonimmune B cells [1] , immunoglobulin (Ig) M memory B cells of seasonal vaccinees [3] , or bone marrow of H5N1-infected ''bird-flu'' survivors [4] . BnAbs with similar properties have also been recovered from immortalized IgGexpressing memory B cells of seasonal vaccinees [5] . An unexpected finding from these studies is the frequent contribution of VH1-69 heavy chain genes to these BnAbs, suggesting that a large fraction (up to 10%) of the human naive B cell repertoire has the capability of responding to this conserved epitope [5, 6] . These observations raise additional questions as to whether such BnAbs are present in human serum and at ''protective'' levels, whether they exist as ''natural'' Abs, and/or whether are they generated during the immune response to influenza virus infection or vaccination [5, 7] . To explore these questions, we analyzed serum samples from H5N1 vaccinees and commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) samples for their crossreactive binding and neutralization activity against different influenza A subtypes. We also utilized a representative BnAb, F10, for which the precise epitope was determined crystallographically [1] , to probe for heterosubtypic BnAbs directed against the highly conserved pocket on the HA stem.",

Although it cannot be formally ruled out that IVIG is truly H5 naive, this was the best representative sample available for this study. H5-immobilized magnetic beads were used to affinity-purify F10-like and anti-H5 Abs from the IVIG. F10-like Abs were isolated by Bio-F10 competition elution from the total H5-beads bound Abs, and the remaining H5-bound Abs on the H5-beads were released with acid elution. By quantitative ELISA, we found that, from 100 mg of IVIG, 10 lg of Abs bound to the H5-coated plate (0.01% of the total). Of these, 10% could be purified using affinity purification with H5-beads by acid elution. The final yields were 1-1.4 lg acid-eluted anti-H5.

Indeed, Corti et al [5] showed that a majority of 2007 and 2008 seasonal vaccinees had preexisting neutralizing Ab titers against pseudotyped H5N1 viruses that markedly increased after seasonal vaccination and that the HA stem-pocket directed Abs were present at relatively low levels, compared with Abs that bind to the globular head of HA.",

Other investigators have shown that a low level of heterotypic anti-HA Abs that bind and neutralize H5N1 viruses is present in IVIG from diverse geographic locations [9, 10] . These investigations further showed that these heterosubtypic anti-H5N1 Abs cross-react with H3N2 and H1N1; however, efforts to purify and characterize these Abs (beyond neutralization titers) have not been reported. Our data show that there are 2 populations of heterosubtypic Abs with different HA binding ability in IVIG: one can bind to HAs from both Group 1 and Group 2 viruses; the other is specifically directed against Group 1 stem pocket. Approximately 0.01% of IVIG (most certainly derived from H5-and H7-naive donors), which is purified by acid elution from H5-beads, has heterosubtypic binding activity to both Group 1 and Group 2 HAs. This fraction of IVIG Abs also demonstrated neutralizing activity against the H1N1 and H5N1 pseudotyped viruses. The F10-like stem pocket-directed Abs were also detected in IVIG and were recovered at 10% of the levels of H5 binding Abs. As expected, these F10-like Abs displayed similar binding and neutralization profiles among the tested HAs and viruses as the Group 1 specific mAbs that are directed to the stem pocket of HA [1, [3] [4] [5] . For both Ab fractions, a broader range of other subtypes were not tested due to limited amount of the Abs that we could purify from IVIG (1 lg and 0.1 lg/100 mg IVIG, respectively), larger-scale purification of H5 protein and other materials will be required to characterize these heterosubtypic BnAbs in more detail.",

            "text": "Although we quantitatively show that BnAbs that bind to Group 1 and 2 HAs are present at very low levels, as well as that stem pocket-directed F10-like BnAbs exist at even lower levels, the question of whether serum or IVIG has protective levels of either type of heterosubtypic BnAbs is not answered in our study. However, our quantitative data support the notion that the levels of these BnAbs are borderline or below titers that would traditionally be considered protective. For example, there is up to 1 lg of F10-like Abs/100 mg IVIG; assuming 10 mg/mL IgG in normal human serum, then concentrations up to 0.1 lg/ ml of F10-like Ab could be present. Likewise, the fraction of acid eluted BnAbs with activities against Groups 1 and 2 could also be in this range. Furthermore, we did observe variability in these levels in our study patients (Figure 1) , and it remains possible that host factors, including VH polymorphism, may impact the baseline and inducible BnAb levels. In addition, the origins of these 2 populations of heterosubtypic anti-HA Abs are unknown. The possibility that they may be a component of ''natural'' polyreactive Abs cannot be excluded [22] . However, it is most likely that both our H5N1 vaccine study subjects and the IVIG donors had prior exposure to other Group 1 (H1N1) and Group 2 (H3N2) influenza A viruses, either through seasonal vaccinations and/or natural infection, and this may have given rise to heterosubtypic H5 and H7 binding Abs, respectively.",

These observations provide the basis for further investigations aimed at obtaining a better understanding of these BnAbs, their origins, and the host genetic factors that restrict or enable their induction [23] . These additional studies should bring us closer to developing a universal influenza vaccine that provides durable protection beyond seasonal vaccines and mitigates that ability of the viruses to undergo neutralization escape. Indeed, a recently reported vaccine regimen-which induced protective level of the Group 1 stem-pocket directed BnAbs in animals-provides experimental evidence that the same may be possible in man [23] .",
