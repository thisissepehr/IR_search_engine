Therefore, the parasite molecules involved in host-cell invasion hold great importance. The human erythrocyte band 3 interacts with a number of P. falciparum proteins and plays an important role in host cell invasion [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Recently, we have shown that the P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 [18, 21, 22] is involved in the host-parasite interaction, and band 3 present on the human erythrocytes also acts as one of its receptors [22] .

The binding activities of wild-type P-4 and TP-4 were almost comparable. However, changing any triplet in TP-4 caused a drastic reduction in the binding activity of this mutated peptide compared to the binding activity displayed by the mutant peptide with a single amino acid change in the same triplet.

An asparagine residue (N203) of this 12 amino acid domain was more critical for binding than any other amino acid residue. This is because mutation of this residue (peptide AVII) resulted in a loss of the maximum erythrocyte binding activity ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). The probable reason for this could be attributed to its stronger interaction observed with two different ectodomains (loop 1 and loop 6) of band 3 protein in SPR (Table 3) . Although peptide AIII with the V199A mutation also interacts with two loops (loop 1 and loop 3), its erythrocyte binding activity was affected to a lesser extent than that of the peptide AVII with the N203A mutation. This difference in erythrocyte binding activity could be attributed to the weaker interaction of this peptide (AIII) with loop 3 than loop 1 of band 3 compared to the mutated peptide AVII, which interacts strongly with both loops (loop 1 and loop 6) of band 3 ( Table 3 ). The glutamine residue of this 12 amino acid peptide domain was interacting with loop 1 of band 3 because its mutation caused a drastic reduction in K D values in SPR, although this did not affect erythrocyte binding activity proportionately. The other mutated peptides interacting with the single loop also showed a minimum effect on erythrocyte binding activity, except for AII (W198A), which also interacts with single loop (loop 6) but had affected the erythrocyte binding activity more than the other mutated peptides binding to a single loop. Indeed, the effect of the W198A mutation on the erythrocyte binding activity of this mutated peptide (AII) was same as in the case of the R207A mutation (peptide AVI), although the latter was interacting with all three loops. Mutant peptides where the above mentioned five amino acids were replaced with alanine showed a reduced affinity for at least one of the band 3 loops, thus accounting for the corresponding reduced red blood cell (RBC) binding. The only mutant peptide (AI) that had a reduced affinity for loop 3 only in SPR was unable to affect RBC binding. Tryptophan residues in several proteins play important role in protein-protein interactions [32] [33] [34] [35] . At the binding interface of the protein-protein interaction, the probability of having tryptophan residues is maximal compared to other amino acids [36] . There are a number of studies where tryptophan residues play an important role in biochemical and biological function. In Plasmodium, the PHIST domains of PHISTa family members contain two positionally conserved tryptophan residues, and one of them plays an important role in its interaction with host erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein band 4.1 [37] . In members of class I cytokine receptor superfamily, the tryptophan rich motif WXXW/WSXWS is involved in various functions, including ligand binding [38] . The binding region of TP-4 of PvTRAg38 also contains the WXXW motif, which could have provided an anchoring role for its binding with band 3. In host-parasite interactions, conserved tryptophan rich motifs are involved in membrane infusion of HIV virus [39, 40] , SARS virus [41] and Ebola virus [42] .
