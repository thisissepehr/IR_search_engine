High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a pivotal inflammatory mediator, plays a potential role as a prognostic biomarker in cardiovascular disease.

Arterial blood samples for HMGB1 measurement were collected from 250 patients after anaesthetic induction (baseline) and 1 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB).

This contrasts with the prognostic value of pre-operative (baseline) high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, which has been shown to be related to an increased risk of major cardiovascular and cerebral events 24 . However, taking into account its characteristics as a nonspecific acute phase reactant, hsCRP seems to be more closely related to the vascular risks such as plaque rupture and vascular thrombosis, showing its predictive role to be limited to the cardiovascular events in patients with coronary and/or metabolic disease 5 . Congruent to our results, CPB duration 25 and pre-operative creatinine 26 are well-recognized risk factors of post-operative morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery. A prolonged duration of CPB may affect the level of post-CPB HMGB1. However, the correlation between post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations and CPB duration was weak (\u03b2 coefficient = 0.373), while the independence of these variables on predicting outcome could be verified in multivariable logistic regression analysis.
