A study indicated that there were more cases in males than in females (the male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1), which is consistent with our results in the descriptive epidemiology [39] . The transmission pattern of shigellosis has shifted from water/food-to-person to person-to-person, with high risk groups being particularly men who have sex with other men (MSM) in developed countries [1] . Meanwhile, numerous studies have reported that the incidence in males is higher than that in female [6] [7] [8] . Does this mean that the transmissibility of shigellosis among males is stronger than that among females? The SEIAR model was developed to verify this hypothesis. However, we obtained the number of cases in five hypotheses using \"knock-out\" simulation.

The median values of the SAR exhibited the following order: SAR fm > SAR mf > SAR mm > SAR ff . Because a model of the total population in Hubei was constructed, the value of SAR was small and within the neighborhood of zero. However, this did not affect the quantification of the transmissibility of shigellosis. A previous study indicated a high incidence in MSM in developed countries owing to unprotected sex and oro-anal contact [1] . However, the proportion of MSM in China is not large. This finding may be related to the fact that the contact rate between males and females, such as kissing, embracing, and shaking hands, is higher than within genders. The results indicate that the most significant transmission route is from female to male. Superior hygiene behaviours may be responsible for the lower female than male incidences. The greatest reason that males are more susceptible than females may be related to superior lifestyle habits, such as hand washing, in female individuals than in males. Moreover, females generally carry out more tasks such as cooking in the home. This finding suggests the importance of emphasizing the importance of washing hands before cooking for females.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 159, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 811, "end": 814, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmissibility of shigellosis in different genders"}, {"text": "The results of this study are consistent with those of most research [41, 42] , which have indicated a heavy disease burden in children under 6 years. There is no doubt that children have a relatively high susceptibility compared to other ages. Furthermore, it is apparent that children often exhibit poor habits such as not washing their hands after using the toilet or before meals. Our results demonstrate that the main transmission route is from the elderly to children. There is a custom in China whereby young parents leave their children in the grandparents' care. This suggests that the most important intervention may be the need to cut off transmission from the elderly. According to the epidemic characteristics of bacterial dysentery, control measures could be implemented in terms of following aspects: a) Focus on females cooking in the home and grandparents caring for grandchildren, such as advocating hand washing. b) Encourage effective hygiene habits to reduce the susceptibility of male individuals and children. c) Reduce the frequency of social behaviour such as kissing, embracing and shaking hands.

It is possible that the transmission would vary according to changes in human behaviour. Thus, further research is required to explore the transmission characteristics of Hubei Province. Numerous studies have indicated that Shigella consists of four species, namely dysenteriae, boydii, flexneri, and sonnei, among which the final two are the most common in low-and middle-income countries [36, 43, 44] . In our study, the dataset was obtained from routine infectious disease surveillance of the CDC in Hubei Province with no reported information regarding the Shigella species. We believe that it is highly necessary to estimate the transmissibility in different Shigella species. Additional data for the different species will need to be collected for analysis. The results have been affected given that we supposed that \u03b2 w = 0 in the SEIAR model and ignored environmental factors (such as water and food). Moreover, owing to the limited availability of data, sociological components (for example, occupations, and cultural and societal backgrounds) were not considered in the model. Additional data relating to sociological factors need to be collected for analysis.
