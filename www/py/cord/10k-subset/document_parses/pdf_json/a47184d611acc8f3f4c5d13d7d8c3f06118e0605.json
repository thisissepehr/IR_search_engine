The semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is the most widely studied photocatalyst. The photosensitizing action of titanium dioxide was first observed in 1929, when as a pigment used in paint, it was found to be responsible for paint fading. This paint fading was because of the photodegradation of the polymer organic binder of the paint by the action of TiO 2 .

TiO 2 is a semiconductor with a band gap close to 3.2 eV, and UV light with wavelengths shorter than $380 nm photoactivates TiO 2 by providing the band gap energy needed by an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band. This implies that when photons of UV-A light are absorbed on TiO 2 , they generate excited pairs of electrons and holes. The photogenerated holes react with the water to produce hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH), while the photogenerated electrons react with molecular oxygen to give superoxide radical anions ( \u2022 O 2 \u00c0 ). These radicals so produced are highly reactive and they work together to completely oxidize the organic species. The attack by the \u2022 OH radical, in the presence of oxygen, thus initiates a complex cascade of oxidative reactions. The mechanism of the photocatalytic process has been extensively studied in the literature and several complex reaction pathways have been reported [7, 16, 29, 35] .
