We have found that substantial demyelination results from the focal inflammatory lesion caused by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 200 ng) directly into the rat dorsal funiculus. Within 24 h, such injections caused a focal inflammatory response consisting of a substantial number of polymorphonuclear cells and ED1-positive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-positive macrophages/microglia. The number of inflammatory cells was substantially reduced by day 7. OX-52-positive T-cells were less frequently observed but were present in the meninges at 8 h, reached a maximum in the dorsal funiculus at 7 days, and were rare at 14 days. The inflammation was followed by the appearance of a large lesion of primary demyelination that encompassed up to $75% of the cross-sectional area of the dorsal funiculus. Treatment with dexamethasone significantly reduced the number of cells expressing iNOS, but did not prevent the demyelination. By 28 days the lesions were largely remyelinated, usually by Schwann cells. These changes were not observed in control, saline-injected animals. We conclude that the intraspinal injection of LPS results in inflammation and subsequently in prominent demyelination. The mechanisms underlying the demyelination are not clear, but it is notable that it typically begins with disruption of the adaxonal myelin. Indeed, there is an early loss of myelin-associated glycoprotein within the lesion, despite the persistence of proteolipid protein. This combination is a feature of the pattern III lesion recently described in multiple sclerosis (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) , and we therefore suggest that LPS-induced demyelination may serve as the first experimental model available for the study of this type of multiple sclerosis lesion.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1771, "end": 1797, "text": "(Lucchinetti et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Abbreviations: AdPC = adenomatous polyposis coli; GFAP = glial fibrillary acidic protein; ICAM-1 = intercellular adhesion molecule-1; iNOS = inducible form of nitric oxide synthase; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; MAG = myelin-associated glycoprotein; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PLP = proteolipid protein; PMN = polymorphonuclear cell", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Inflammation within the CNS is a common feature of neurological disorders and infection, but whether it contributes directly to neuronal or glial damage in vivo can be difficult to determine. For example, in a disease such as multiple sclerosis, and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), immune-mediated inflammation can be prominent but it is difficult to disentangle the indirect consequences of the inflammation from other ongoing immune-mediated disease processes. Experimentally, inflammation can be induced in most tissues by the local injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and typically large numbers of neutrophils and monocytes invade the tissue from the bloodstream within minutes, macrophages remaining at the site for a number of days (Issekutz et al., 1981; Cybulsky et al., 1988) .

In two studies where myelin was examined, some limited myelin loss was reported. Matyszak and Perry (1995) found that the injection of killed bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) directly into the hippocampus produced an acute inflammatory response but did not result in myelin loss. However, when animals were subsequently given BCG peripherally, a delayed-type hypersensitivity developed which was associated with myelin loss, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. In a subsequent study (Matyszak et al., 1997) it was demonstrated that, at least in small pockets, this myelin loss resulted from primary demyelination. Lehnardt and colleagues found a reduction in immunolabelling with the oligodendrocyte marker RIP following large doses of LPS (5 mg) injected into the pericallosal white matter of neonatal rats (Lehnardt et al., 2002) . However, such doses of LPS produced destructive, cystic lesions in many animals, and so although the nature of the myelin loss was not examined in detail, it seems likely to have been secondary to axonal degeneration.

Such direct cell damage is suggested by studies demonstrating a detrimental effect of LPS on the survival of oligodendrocyte progenitors in vitro (Molina-Holgado et al., 2001) . However, mRNA for LPS receptors is either absent [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)] or found only at very low levels (CD14) in oligodendrocyte precursors (Lehnardt et al., 2002) . On the other hand, many commercial preparations of LPS have been shown to contain contaminants that are highly bioactive, and can activate receptors other than TLR4, including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) (Hirschfeld et al., 2000) , a receptor that has been reported to be expressed by oligodendrocytes (Bsibsi et al., 2002) . This contamination is perhaps best illustrated by the ability of these preparations to activate leucocytes from C3H/HeJ mice, which lack functional TLR4 (Morrison et al., 1976) . To examine the possibility that our typical LPS preparation was indeed acting via other receptors, we also examined the effect of an LPS preparation that does not activate cells from C3H/HeJ mice. The lesions resulting from such injections (Fig. 11 ) appeared similar to those produced by the less pure LPS preparation, indicating that the lesions are the result of the LPS, as expected, and probably mediated by TLR4 activation. Thus, if TLR4 is absent in adult oligodendrocytes they would be unlikely to respond directly to LPS since this receptor is thought to play a key role in signal transduction following LPS binding (Poltorak et al., 1998; Hoshino et al., 1999) . These considerations suggest that LPS may be acting via other, indirect, mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 285, "text": "(Molina-Holgado et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 437, "end": 460, "text": "(Lehnardt et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 667, "end": 692, "text": "(Hirschfeld et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 765, "end": 786, "text": "(Bsibsi et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 942, "end": 965, "text": "(Morrison et al., 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1616, "text": "(Poltorak et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1638, "text": "Hoshino et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1208, "end": 1216, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The apparent conflict between the findings of Molina-Holgado et al. (2001) , indicating that oligodendrocyte progenitors are sensitive to LPS, and the seeming absence of appropriate receptors, as demonstrated by Lehnardt et al. (2002) , is probably due to the degree of cellular purity of the examined cultures. Lehnardt and colleagues found that the deleterious effect of LPS on oligodendrocyte progenitors was dependent on the presence of microglia (Lehnardt et al., 2002) , and a role for these cells is also supported by the observation that conditioned media from LPS-exposed microglia (or astrocytes) injured oligodendrocyte progenitors (Pang et al., 2000) . The factor(s) responsible are not clear, but a role for TNF-a is possible since this cytokine has been shown to damage rodent (Selmaj and Raine, 1988; Cammer, 2002) and human (Jurewicz et al., 2003) oligodendrocytes in vitro. However, injection of TNF-a into white matter in vivo does not result in demyelination (Hall et al., 2000) , and so if this agent is involved it may act in concert with other factors; or perhaps demyelination can result from chronic, rather than acute, exposure to TNF-a. Recent evidence suggests that peroxynitrite (formed from nitric oxide and superoxide anion) plays a key role in LPS-induced, microglial-mediated oligodendrocyte damage in vitro (Li et al., 2004) . Thus, although LPS might not be directly toxic to oligodendrocytes, it could cause demyelination indirectly via factors derived from activated microglia, astrocytes or macrophages. Arguing against this possibility is the fact that dexamethasone treatment reduced the inflammatory response, as indicated by the reduction in cells expressing iNOS, yet demyelination was at least as extensive as that seen in control animals. Dexamethasone is known to inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kB and activated protein-1 in monocytic cells, leading to decreased production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1b (Jeon et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 46, "end": 74, "text": "Molina-Holgado et al.

First, the dexamethasone treatment may not have adequately suppressed the inflammation. This may be the case, since iNOS activity was suppressed, but not eliminated, in the lesion. Secondly, the cellular actions of both LPS and dexamethasone are complex, and activation of cells by LPS via pathways unaffected by dexamethasone may also have occurred, perhaps via the MyD88-independent cascade following TLR4 activation (for review see Akira and Takeda, 2004) . Certainly, dexamethasone has recently been shown actually to enhance expression of tissue factor (Reddy et al., 2004) , a transmembrane glycoprotein present on monocytic cells which activates coagulation cascades. Local activation of tissue factor might have resulted in ischaemia, thereby augmenting the lesions. In summary, although the mechanism of LPS-induced demyelination is not known, we favour the idea that oligodendrocytes are killed by a factor or factors produced by activated inflammatory cells, particularly in the light of the finding that LPS-activated microglia are capable of inducing oligodendrocyte damage in culture (Lehnardt et al., 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 564, "text": "Akira and Takeda, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 664, "end": 684, "text": "(Reddy et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1227, "text": "(Lehnardt et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Could the current observations on LPS-induced demyelination illuminate the mechanisms involved in the demyelination observed in inflammatory demyelinating disease? CNS demyelination occurs in association with inflammation in a number of disorders, including multiple sclerosis (Lassmann, 1999), Devic's neuromyelitis optica (Baudoin et al., 1998) , recurrent transverse myelitis (Pandit and Rao, 1996) , HTLV-1 associated tropical spastic paraparesis (Ijichi et al., 1996) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Stuve and Zamvil, 1999) , including the form of the latter disorder which is associated with infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae (Heick and Skriver, 2000) . However, our understanding of the mechanism of demyelination in such disorders is often incomplete. It is possible that the mechanism involved in one or more of these disorders may be common to that operating in the current experimental lesion; if so, the current lesion could act as a useful model with which to explore the mechanism for potential therapeutic targets. We note in particular that in the current lesion MAG is lost before other myelin proteins, and this loss appears to occur just prior to the initiation of demyelination. Such preferential loss of MAG also occurs in some inflammatory demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis, designated 'pattern III' by Lucchinetti and colleagues (Lucchinetti et al., 2000; Aboul-Enein et al., 2003) . The unusual initiation of demyelination in the periaxonal myelin may be another manifestation of this early MAG loss, as MAG is normally found in the periaxonal myelin in the CNS (Trapp et al., 1989) . This pattern of demyelination is not reproduced by the usual experimental model for multiple sclerosis, namely EAE (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) . It is notable that in both multiple sclerosis (H. Lassmann, personal communication) and the current LPS model this unusual pattern of demyelination occurs in conjunction with microglial activation and the prominent expression of iNOS.
