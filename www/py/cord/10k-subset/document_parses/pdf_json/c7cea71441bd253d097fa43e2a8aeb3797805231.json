However, the effects of PFCs on ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced lung injury have not been investigated. Typical acute lung injury was induced in rats by 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion in isolated and perfused rat lung model. Rat lungs were randomly assigned to receive PBS (control), 1 % FC-77, IR only, or IR with different doses of FC-77 (0.1 %, 0.5 %, or 1 %). Subsequently, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), perfusate, and lung tissues were collected to evaluate the degree of lung injury. IR caused a significant increase in the following parameters: pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary filtration coefficient, lung weight gain, lung weight/body weight ratio, wet/dry lung weight ratio, and protein concentration in BALF. TNF-\u03b1 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 concentrations in perfusate samples and MDA concentration and MPO activities in lung tissues were also significantly increased. Histopathology showed increased septal thickness and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissues. Furthermore, NF-\u03baB activity was significantly increased in the lungs. However, pretreatment with 1 % FC-77 prior to IR significantly attenuated the increases in these parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that systemic FC-77 administration had a protective effect on IRinduced acute lung injury. These protective mechanisms may have been mediated by the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and attenuation of subsequent inflammatory response.",

Because of these advantages, liquid ventilation with PFCs was initially shown to improve acute lung injury in animal models and a few human studies. Important mechanisms that attenuate lung inflammation include the distention of collapsed alveoli to improve lung compliance, improvement of oxygenation by increasing oxygen diffusion, and removal of inflammatory mediators from the alveolar regions of the lung [2] [3] [4] . However, two subsequent large clinical trials of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) showed that liquid ventilation was not beneficial for improving survival [5, 6] .",

In addition, systemic FC-77 administration has been shown to attenuate acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) [15, 16] . Although PFCs reportedly limit the infarction size in IR heart injury [17, 18] , the beneficial effects of FC-77 on IR-induced acute lung injury remain unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine whether systemic FC-77 administration ameliorates acute lung injury induced by IR. In this experiment, we used a well-established model of isolated rat lung because it enabled us to measure the pulmonary filtration coefficient (K f ), which is the most accurate indicator of pulmonary capillary permeability [19] .",

The animals used for this study were cared for in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (National Academy Press, 1996) , and approval for our study protocol was obtained from the National Science Council and Animal Review Committee of the National Defense Medical Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight 250-350 g) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital sodium (20-25 mg/rat). Tracheostomy was performed to enable ventilation with a rodent ventilator (7025; Ugo Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy). The rat lungs were ventilated with 5 % CO 2 in air at 65-70 breaths/minute with a tidal volume of 2 mL. After a median sternotomy was performed, heparin (1 U/g of body weight) was injected into the right ventricle, from which 10 mL of blood was collected. This blood sample was mixed with 10 mL of normal saline containing 1.5 % human serum albumin. This was subsequently used as a perfusing fluid for the isolated lungs. For constant-flow perfusion of the isolated lungs, a cannula was inserted into the pulmonary artery via a right-ventricular puncture. A tight ligature was placed around the main trunk of the pulmonary artery. A widebore cannula was inserted into the left atrium via the left ventricle to divert pulmonary venous outflow into a reservoir. The wide-bore cannula was then fixed with a ligature at the apex of the heart. Another ligature was placed above the atrioventricular junction to prevent the flow of the perfusate into the ventricles. Both the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and the pulmonary venous pressure (PVP) were recorded from side arms of the inflow and outflow cannula. A roller pump was used to provide constant perfusion flow at a rate of approximately 8-10 mL/min to stabilize PAP at 15-20 cmH 2 O. PVP was set at 4-6 cmH 2 O by adjusting the height of the venous reservoir. With the isolated perfused lungs remaining in situ, the whole rat was placed on an electronic balance. The digital signals of the electronic balance were converted to analog signals with a digital-to-analog converter and were recorded on an oscillograph recorder. Isolated lung preparations were used in this study only if they satisfied three criteria: (1) no leakage at the sites of cannula insertion, (2) no evidence of bleeding or edema, and (3) an isogravimetric state.",
