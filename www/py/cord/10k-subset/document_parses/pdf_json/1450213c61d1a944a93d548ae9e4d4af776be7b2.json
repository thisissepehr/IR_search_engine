In this framework, we study an axiomatic decision model and prove a representation theorem. Resulting decision criteria aggregate partial evaluations consisting of (i) the conditional expected utility associated with the analyzed part of the decision, and (ii) the best and worst consequences of its non-analyzed part. The representation theorem is consistent with a wide variety of decision criteria, which allows for expressing various degrees of knowledge on (A,\u0100) and various types of attitude toward ambiguity and uncertainty. This diversity is taken into account by specific models already existing in the literature. We exploit this fact and propose some particular forms of our model incorporating these models as sub-models and moreover expressing various types of beliefs concerning the relative plausibility of the analyzed and the non-analyzed events ranging from probabilities to complete ignorance that include capacities.",

In standard models, decisions are evaluated on the basis of the probabilities that they lead to such or such result. Now, whereas it is possible to estimate with precision some risks, such as automobile risks (thanks to actuarial data), the evaluation of others, such as natural disasters is more difficult (statistics on frequencies and magnitudes are scarce). Such an evaluation becomes even more problematic for environmental risks such as those resulting from global warming or from genetically modified organisms (GMO) and for some health risks such as epidemics. Although all these risks are perfectly identified, it seems difficult to assign probabilities to the relevant events as well as to evaluate their effects precisely.",

The effectiveness of a given strategy depends on the values of several parameters which are initially unknown such as ways of spreading of the disease, the type of infection (viral/bacterial), etc. The introduction, for a given strategy, of the event associated with an effective control and of the complementary event can always be made, although generally it will not be possible to assess the relative likelihood of these two events (no quantitative information is attached to them). Then, conditionally on an effective control, a routine situation is recovered and standard utility/probability evaluation can be performed; whereas, conditionally on a poor control, predictions that can be made are vague (for instance, a number of casualties ranging from one thousand to one million) and, further, cannot be improved by recourse to a refined analysis.",

(ii) We only introduce a single non-analyzed event for a given decision. The reason is that specifying more precise outcome intervals on subsets of\u0100 would be, in our opinion, deceptive. The fact that an event such as \"the number of deaths resulting from poor control of SARS is between 100 000 and 500 000\" can be precisely described in words does not endow it with any assessable weight (such as a conditional probability or capacity). Thus, in accordance with general principles of rational decision making under complete ignorance (Arrow and Hurwicz 1972; Cohen and Jaffray 1980; Barbera et al. 1984) , decisions should depend only on the best and the worst outcomes on all subsets which is to say on the best and worst ones on the whole of\u0100 itself. By the way, Jaffray (1980, 1983) show that, under complete ignorance, consistency with the weak dominance principle rules out a weak ordering of the decisions although both properties are \"approximately compatible\". For this reason, the satisfaction of weak dominance on the non-analyzed part of decisions is not required but the model still guarantees the absence of awkward implications.",
