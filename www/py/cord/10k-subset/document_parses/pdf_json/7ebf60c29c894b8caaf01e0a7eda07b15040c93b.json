Methods: We performed a prospective study of patients admitted to three adult ICUs of our hospital from December 2010 to February 2011. All tracheal aspirate (TA) samples sent to the microbiology department were systematically screened for influenza. We defined influenza as unsuspected if testing was not requested and the patient was not receiving empirical antiviral therapy after sample collection. Results: We received TA samples from 105 patients. Influenza was detected in 31 patients and was classified as unsuspected in 15 (48.4%) patients, and as hospital acquired in 13 (42%) patients. Suspected and unsuspected cases were compared, and significant differences were found for age (53 versus 69 median years), severe respiratory failure (68.8% versus 20%), surgery (6.3% versus 60%), median days of ICU stay before diagnosis (1 versus 4), nosocomial infection (18.8% versus 66.7%), cough (93.8% versus 53.3%), localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (6.3% versus 40%), median days to antiviral treatment (2 versus 9), pneumonia (93.8% versus 53.3%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (75% versus 26.7%). Multivariate analysis showed admission to the surgical ICU (odds ratio (OR), 37.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1 to 666.6; P = 0.01) and localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (OR, 27.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 584.1; P = 0.03) to be independent risk factors for unsuspected influenza. Overall mortality at 30 days was 29%. ICU admission for severe respiratory failure was an independent risk factor for poor outcome.

In most cases, the etiology is bacterial, although viruses have been implicated in almost 9% of cases [17] . During the 2009 pandemic, the rate of ICU admission for respiratory failure among hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1v) ranged from 15% to 34% [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, no studies have investigated the rates of bacterial and viral etiologies among patients admitted to the ICU with suggestion of lower respiratory tract infection during the 2009 pandemic. Here, we demonstrated that, after the pandemic influenza season, the etiology was viral in 31.4% of patients admitted to the ICU with suggestion of lower The etiology of acute febrile respiratory illness causing respiratory failure is often unknown at admission to the ICU [17] . About half of the cases are diagnosed as bacterial pneumonia shortly after admission, with a small number of cases found to be viral pneumonia when the initial bacterial studies are negative [10] . Detection of influenza virus often depends on specific epidemiologic risk factors and clinical suspicion. The combination of fever, malaise, and cough was shown to have a 79% positive predictive value during the pandemic and seasonal epidemics [23, 24] ; however, these criteria may be not accurate in ICU patients, because other etiologies, or conditions like as postsurgery sedation, may confound the diagnosis [25] . In our study, influenza was unsuspected in 48.4% of cases. Suspicion of influenza was lower in older patients, in those admitted to the ICU for surgical conditions, in those who stayed for a longer time in hospital and ICU, and in those who did not have a cough and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. The direct consequence of overlooked influenza was a significant delay in the initiation of antiviral treatment. Definitive diagnosis of influenza is by detection of the virus in culture or RT-PCR with a nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab or lower respiratory tract sample [23, 24] . Because viral shedding peaks at 48 hours after the onset of illness and declines thereafter, testing of lower respiratory tract samples in patients with compromised lung parenchyma may be more beneficial [23, 26, 27] . Accordingly, we found that the upper respiratory tract sample did not reveal influenza in 17.6% of cases.

Findings could vary between one influenza season and another, depending on the characteristics of the prevalent influenza virus stain. We did not perform a costeffectiveness analysis, although the finding of a longer ICU and hospital stay in patients with unsuspected influenza suggests a potential favorable impact on care management. We could not perform an analysis of the possible routes of transmission of the nosocomial cases. However, we can exclude with sufficient certainty the occurrence of an outbreak for the following reasons: (a) the cases of hospital-acquired influenza were distributed uniformly between the three ICUs (postsurgery ICU, six; medical ICU, five; and postcardiosurgery ICU, two); (b) no case of influenza was recognized among the healthcare staff during the study period; (c) the preventive measures included vaccination of staff, respiratory isolation, and droplet-contact precautions, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1247, "end": 1251, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We showed that influenza is a common cause of acute respiratory illness among patients admitted to the ICU during seasonal epidemics, and that it is often overlooked, and it could lead to a delay in the initiation of antiviral treatment and possible nosocomial transmission of influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Microbiology departments should systematically investigate the presence of influenza in respiratory samples obtained from ICU patients during the seasonal epidemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "\u2022 The incidence of influenza in the adult ICU during the influenza season is high.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Key messages"}, {"text": "\u2022 The diagnosis of influenza is often overlooked in ICU patients.
