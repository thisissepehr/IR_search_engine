The ability to use, share, and harness the potential of data so as to inform practice, and improve health care decisions, is the underlying platform of a LHS. Generating new knowledge rapidly, accelerating the adoption of innovations and discoveries, integrating new data sources, and providing guidance to providers regarding treatment effectiveness and patient risks are some of the benefits to be derived in a LHS. While rapid learning is the pinnacle goal of a LHS, lowering health care costs, improved population health, empowering consumers, and driving innovation have also been stated as outcomes of a LHS. A Health Data Management infrastructure that encourages and implements innovative policies, practices is a requisite for supporting a LHS. The meaningful use of EHR's, incorporating patient generated data, providing patient access to their health information, ensuring data quality and integrity, creating data trust, as well as implementing a supportive information governance environment are but some of the opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed to drive forward the future of health care and achieve a LHS.",

            "text": "Most health outcomes arise from longitudinal processes and are analyzed using time-to-event or survival analysis methods, which are the focus of STRATOS Topic Group 8 (TG8). The paramount challenge is to accurately account for time-related complexities, which require developing specialized methods to address even those analytical issues which, in other analyses, are adequately handled by 'standard' statistical methods. We will illustrate such complexities using two examples, both involving challenges investigated also by other STRATOS TG's, which emphasizes the need for STRATOS-wide collaborations to develop an integrated modeling approach. The first challenge involves modeling the effects, i.e. functional forms, of continuous covariates. TG2 aims at developing guidance for flexible modeling of possibly nonlinear effects of continuous covariates in multivariable analyses. However, we will demonstrate how, in the specific context of survival analyses, the accuracy of both estimating and testing of non-linear (NL) effects may be affected by imposing a priori proportional hazards (PH) assumption, which underlies the extremely popular Cox PH model. The PH assumption implies that the effects of the covariates remain constant during the entire follow-up period, but there is ample empirical evidence of time-dependent (TD) effects, where the hazard ratio changes substantially during the follow-up [1] . We will show, using both simulated and real-life data (concerning prediction of death after a septic shock, and prognostic studies of cancer recurrence or mortality) how ignoring TD effects may lead to biased estimates and invalid conclusions regarding NL effects, and vice versa, and affect the accuracy of risk prediction or (cost-)effectiveness assessment of health interventions [2] . Another time-related complexity arises when the values of the covariates themselves change during the follow-up time, implying use of time-varying covariates (TVC). The challenge is how to define the TVC that best reflects the way past covariate values may affect current hazard. This problem can be seen as a complex case of measurement errors, which are the focus of TG4. We will demonstrate that the choice of the way repeated-over-time TVC values are aggregated in the analysis may have a major impact on the model's fit to data and/or power to detect an association [3] . We will then propose a more flexible weighted cumulative exposure model and illustrate its advantages in modeling TVC in the analyses of adverse effects of medications [4] . Additional challenges are faced if the longitudinal changes in TVC are driven by the same process that affects the clinical endpoint and have to be predicted, together with survival, using joint modeling methodology [5] .",

However, it remains unclear whether weight gain per se promotes colorectal cancer and what exact mechanisms may underline this association.

This association was accounted mostly for by attained waist circumference [reduction of 61 %], and by the biomarkers soluble leptin receptor [reduction of 43 %] and glycated hemoglobin [reduction of 28 %]. Other factors that showed an influence on the association included the biomarkers of oxidative stress-ROM [reduction of 11 %] and FRAP [reduction of 13 %] and the iron metabolism biomarker-transferrin [reduction of 17 %]. Attained BMI in adulthood and leptin attenuated the association by 24 and 21 % respectively; however these changes did not prove to be statistically significant. Among the biomarkers, sOB-R and HbA1c further attenuated the association beyond waist circumference by 58 and 35 %, respectively. Conclusions These novel data suggest that the observed association between adult weight gain and colon cancer could be primarily explained by attained abdominal fatness and biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction. Avoiding weight gain and metabolic control from early adulthood on through lifestyle modifications could provide valid means for improved CRC prevention.",

The aim of this paper is to analyze and assess the quality of available query translation methods for CLIR on a health portal for psychology. A test base of 100 user queries, 50 Multi Word Units (WUs) and 50 Single WUs, was used. Swedish was the source language and English the target language. Query translation methods based on machine translation (MT) and dictionary look-up were utilized in order to submit query translations to two search engines: Google Site Search and Quick Ask. Standard IR evaluation measures and a qualitative analysis were utilized to assess the results. The lexicon extracted with word alignment of the portal's parallel corpus provided better statistical results among dictionary look-ups. Google Translate provided more linguistically correct translations overall and also delivered better retrieval results in MT.",

To our knowledge this is the first comparison of the three approaches that focuses on the medical domain. Results CLIR based on MT translates the source language query into target language query with the help of commercial software for machine translation. Linguistic and semantic analysis are applied on user queries in order to improve translation quality. MT approaches have sometimes performed worse compared to dictionary based translations in particular for short queries. The information contained in oneword queries can be too limited to find out the context of the word. Quality MT systems are also difficult and expensive to build and sometimes limited to specific languages (Zhu & Wang, 2006) . Other drawback of MT is that systems tend to lack adaptation to specific domains (like the medical domain) and have economic, usage constraints (Pecina et al. 2014) . In recent years machine translation approaches based on statistics (SMT) and training data have become more and more popular. The strength of this approach is that it utilizes advanced machine learning techniques training translation models on monolingual and bilingual resources in specific domains.",

However, special equipment such as a three-dimensional position analyzer for accurate measurement of gait is complex and expensive [1] . Therefore, such special equipment is often unavailable for routine gait assessments of the elderly. In this study, we developed a posture analysis system based on a small information terminal to provide a system that can be used for elderly gait assessment in research and clinical practice. Also, pedometers designed for healthy people cannot count the number of steps accurately when the elderly walk slowly [2, 3] . We devised a new algorithm for smartphones that detects the number of steps during slow walking. Methods Overview First, we developed a stand-alone system (ver.1) for measuring the patient's posture, and verified the accuracy of the measured angles. Second, we developed remote a control system with a control terminal and two measurement terminals (ver.2). Finally, we devised a new algorithm that detects the number of steps in the slow walking of patients with hemiplegia, and verified the accuracy of this algorithm (ver.3). Ver. 1 Subjects wore two iPod Touch (5th generation) on their chests (anterior to the sternal bone) and their lumbars (posterior to the sacrum bone) regions, and inclination angles in the anteroposterior and horizontal directions were measured. Ver. 2 When a user touches the measurement terminal, unwanted signal noise is generated. For that reason, we have developed a controller for remotely controlling the measurement terminals. Ver. 3 We devised a new algorithm by the use of the frequency analysis.",

Acid-Base blood (ASB) test is a an worldwide standard in treatment patients in critical stage. However the clinical value of this test remains under estimated especially in the conditions of support ventilation of patients. The current study aims to propose a new integral indicator of patient routine ASB test of capillary blood based on trained artificial network. Methods ASB test results of 367 SMI patients, all over 1400 tests, were used to train 1-rank neural network. As the result the linear classifier was developed. The output of this classifier is in integral value varied from relative (?10) to relative (-10) . Negative values indicate the negative prognosis of patient status. For clinical assessment of proposed method a special module was added to Clinical Information System. This module allows to compare the output of neural network with clinical evaluation of highly professional medical experts.",

We screened the titles first for relevance and later abstracts. 47 articles met our criteria and were finally reviewed. A literature matrix was formed in Excel for compilation and analysis. Results Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh were different compared to initial outbreak in Malaysia in 1999. Unlike Malaysian outbreak, person to person transmission occurred in Bangladesh leaving humans most vulnerable. Infections were reported in domesticated pigs, dogs, cats in South Asia and serological study in Bangladesh showed 6.5, 4.3 and 44.2 % seroprevalence in cattle, goat and pig respectively. Pteropus bat plays a key role in Nipah transmission and risk factors include drinking raw date palm sap contaminated with bat urine or faeces, eating halfeaten bat saliva laden fruit and close contact or involvement in burial of cases. As date palm sap is harvested during winter, Nipah outbreaks mostly occurred during this season. Nipah occurred within the ''Nipah belt'' and had a high case fatality of more than 70 %. Avoiding raw date palm sap and drinking sap from trees protected with bamboo skirt or ''bana'' remain the principle preventive measures along with strict infection control in hospitals for prevention of secondary cases. Conclusion Extensive knowledge of this emerging zoonosis is the key for prevention and saving lives. Community sensitization and multisectoral intervention through One Health approach can prevent this deadly disease especially in outbreak areas.",

Computerized decision aids (CDAs) are a set of tools that can help patients making informed decisions about their health. The main objective of this paper is to review the literature on CDAs in pregnancy and child birth and their effects on the knowledge acquired, decisional conflict, and clinical outcomes. Methods: We included published studies about interventions designed to help pregnant women in making decisions about screening options and obstetrical treatment. Two authors systematically searched the electronic bibliographic databases Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October 2013 and OVID Embase (1980 to October 2013 for articles published in English. We only included observational and RCTs studies where computerized tools (such as electronic pamphlets, educational brochures, booklets, audio-books, and decision boards, etc.) were used. Studies which did not use computerized tools (e.g., pamphlet/ educational brochure/booklet, audio-booklet, decision board) were excluded. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the selected studies by ''The Cochrane risk of bias assessment'' tool [1] . The search keywords were website, internet, ''decision support'', ''decision aids'', alert, reminder, teleconsult*, pregnancy, gestation, matern*, obstetrics. Results: we identified 190 potentially relevant articles on the basis of the abstract (n = 3511 titles).182 articles were excluded on grounds of irrelevance to the population, interventions, outcomes, or study design. The reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews led to the identification of two additional articles. Ten studies included seven Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) and three observational studies. Six studies used computerized decision aids in the form of a computer program, computer based information system, or computer generated reminders, and four studies assessed decision aids in the form of email or web based consultation. Compared to written materials or routine care, CDAs have improved pregnant women's knowledge on specifics subjects [2, 3, 4] . A CDA tool is more effective than a written informational document in reducing decisional conflict (based on O'Connor's decisional conflict scale) (p \\ 0.05). Three studies demonstrated improved health outcomes including increased rate of vaginal delivery after a previous cesarean section [5] , undergoing invasive prenatal testing [4] , and intended external cephalic version for breech presentation [3] , but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Computerized decision aids showed improved effects on various health outcomes (higher knowledge acquisition, reduced decisional conflicts) compared to the traditional written patient educational pamphlets and routine care. Further research on other potential effects of CDAs on patient decisions and clinical outcomes are still required.",

In 2013 Swat region, which has been under insurgency since several years, was hit by a major dengue outbreak. [3, 4] This outbreak was comparable with 2011 outbreak in Lahore, Punjab in which more than 300 people died. In this outbreak in total 9032 cases of dengue fever were reported along with death of 33 people [5, 6, 7] . Outbreak was started suddenly in August and ended in November, 2013. More than half 6473 cases were reported in September. Methods Data for all the reported cases of dengue fever was collected from district health offices which collect the reported data. As it is a notifiable disease so the physicians have to report any case immediately. After devolution of powers district health information system is working efficiently for collection of routinely collected health data. Data was cleaned and then visualized into graphical representation via MS Excel 2010. ArcGIS 10.3 was used to generate incidence rate map of dengue in the district at union council level.",

Graphs also show month wise distribution as well as gender distribution during that sudden outbreak in 2013. Map generated shows the incidence rate per each union council in Swat district. Male accounted for 6157 (68 %) of the affected reported cases while remaining 2875 (32 %) were females. Mean age of infected reported cases was found to be 29.70. There are several factors which may have contributed to this sudden rise of dengue fever in Swat. In all the outbreaks male to female ration of infected population has been around 70:30. It can be attributed to the cultural practices because women normally don't go out to work while men work in fields. It is suspected that government operations against insurgents lead to under reporting of epidemic in the region which leads to sudden outbreak. There is need to further explore the climatic conditions and land-cover land-use changes which potentially might contribute to dengue outbreak. Best control measure of dengue virus is to control its vector. Conclusion It can be concluded that time period from August to October is favorable season for the growth of mosquitoes which are vector of dengue virus. During this time period active vector control measures must be taken along with awareness campaigns to effectively control the spread of dengue infection. Areas which are highly affected by dengue must be given special consideration for effective dengue control.",

Eleven studies found that MD increased in ever HRT users compared to never users and the highest increase in MD was observed in current users compared to former and never HRT users. Six studies showed that using oestrogen ? progestin (E ? P) was associated with higher MD than oestrogen alone use. In addition, 4 studies reported that continuous oestrogen ? progestin (CEP) users had higher MD than sequential oestrogen ? progestin (SEP) and oestrogen alone users. However, 2 studies showed that SEP users had higher MD compared to CEP and oestrogen alone users. Conclusions Epidemiological evidence is rather consistent suggesting that there is a positive association between HRT use and MD among menopausal women, with the highest increase in MD among current users, and CEP users. The potential public health implications of this association are increased breasts discomfort, reduced sensitivity and specificity in detecting small tumours during mammography screening in women using HRT, and possibly increased breast cancer risk. registry for intensive care (IC) called NICE [2] . To this end a mapping is realized between the items in the quality registry and the DCMs. 2. Methods In the Netherlands, 44 DCMs are available describing different parts of the care process and clinical findings (e.g. demographics, contact information, blood pressure, etc.). The NICE registry contains 26 items on demographics and administrative information, 53 on physiology and laboratory outcomes, and 472 diagnoses, i.e. 445 reasons for admission based on APACHE IV classification [3] and 27 comorbidities. These diagnoses have been mapped to SNOMED CT. 3. Results Twenty-two percent of the registry items could be mapped to a DCM. For 14 % of the items a DCM was not available. For 64 % of these items a DCM was available, but the context used in the definition of the item (e.g. worst value in the first 24 h of admission) could not be represented with the DCMs and therefore a full mapping could not be realized. Sixty-eight percent of the reasons for IC admission could be mapped to a precoordinated SNOMED CT concept, the other 32 % needed post coordination. Twenty-two percent of the comorbidities could be mapped to a SNOMED CT concept. For the remaining comorbidities, the definition was too ambiguous (37 %) or too narrow with additional context (41 %) to be mapped to SNOMEC CT. 4. Discussion DCMs were initially meant to support data exchange between institutions and therefore items related to the location of a patient within an institution (e.g. IC admission date) cannot be captured with current DCMs. Applying DCMs made explicit that the use of international terminologies such as SNOMED CT is assumed, but not yet realized for entry of diagnoses in the Netherlands. It also clarified that definitions of some data items in the quality registry are ambiguous which should be solved. DCMs are meant to aid standardized point-of-care data capture for clinical process. However, as in each quality registry, also the NICE registry requires specific context for data items that are currently not included in the DCMs. For instance, for physiologicaland laboratory outcomes, the NICE registry requires the worst values (e.g. for blood pressure) in the first 24 h of admissions. Although there is a DCM for instance blood pressure, the context related to the worst value in the first 24 h of admission cannot be captured. This registry specific context should be handled in the software using queries when extracting the data to the registry. 4.1. Conclusion Changes in the registry items and extensions of the DCMs are required for DCMs to aid a quality registry. The panel discussion will have participants from ECDC and the health informatics community, discussing state of the art and future of information management in the domain of infectious disease prevention and control. There will be ECDC authors shortly presenting current and future characteristics of EU regulated information flow and management regarding data on infectious diseases epidemiology and epidemic intelligence. There will be special emphasis on data intensive activities as molecular surveillance. External panelists are asked to introduce possible influence of new paradigms of big data, reusable semantic assets, medical terminologies, ontologies on infectious disease information management. Other areas to investigate are the role of social media, emerging fields as digital surveillance.

In contrast, aCL was detected in 2/30 (6.7 %) of control subjects; each of the other anti-phospholipid antibodies (APLA) was never observed. Of all the ab2-GPI ? cases, the incidence of stroke patients having the combined profile of ab2-GPI ? aCL was 11/14 (78.6 %) and of ab2-GPI ? aPS was 9/14 (64.3 %). Only 2/14 (14.3 %) of these ab2-GPI ? patients also expressed aCL in the absence of aPS. The frequency of patients expressing all three markers was only 9/14 (64.3 %). In none of the APS/stroke patients were aCL or aPS expressed in the absence of the ab2-GPI. Conversely, IgG ab2-GPI as a sole marker was seen in 3/14 (21.4 %) of these patients (i.e. in absence of either other marker). Conclusion It can be concluded from these studies that the among the three major forms of APLA examined, the presence of IgG ab2-GPI autoantibodies appeared to correlate best with stroke in patients who were concurrently suffering APS.",

This paper presents an approach for a SNOMED-CT concept extraction with a customized natural language processing pipeline for German clinical notes using Apache cTAKES. The objectives are, to prove the natural language processing tool for German language if it is suitable to identify UMLS concepts and SNOMED-CT Codes. The German UMLS database and German OpenNLP models extended the natural language processing pipeline, so the pipeline can normalize to domain ontologies such as SNOMED-CT using German UMLS concepts. For comparison, the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 training dataset translated into German was used. The implemented algorithms are tested with a set of 199 German reports including 11,797 UMLS concepts and obtained a result of 9,018 concepts that could be mapped to SNOMED-CT. The number of mapped codes is a quantity characteristic and does not describe the quality and the correctness of the mapping.",

For the analysis of adverse events simple standard methods for contingency tables are commonly used. However, the application of simple standard methods may be misleading if observations are censored at the time of discontinuation due to treatment switching or noncompliance, resulting in unequal observation times. To account for varying observation times frequently incidence densities, i.e. events per patient years, are used to quantify the risk of adverse events. For comparisons between groups incidence density ratios are used together with confidence intervals based upon the Poisson distribution. The corresponding results are interpreted in the same way as hazard ratios. In this talk, the validity of the incidence density ratio as approximation of the hazard ratio is investigated by means of simulations. Methods A simulation study was performed by using various survival time distributions with constant, increasing and decreasing hazard functions. A number of different data situations were considered using various sample sizes, various baseline risks, various effect sizes, and various differences of mean observations times between the groups. From the simulated survival times hazard ratios were estimated by using the Cox proportional hazards model. Incidence density ratios with corresponding confidence intervals were estimated by usual formulas based upon the Poisson distribution. As performance measures the coverage probability, the relative bias, and the mean squared error were applied by using the true hazard ration for the comparisons.",

The STRATOS topic group ''High-Dimensional Data'' has formed to deal with the multitude of available proposals. Specifically, approaches for design considerations, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, data reduction, multiple testing, developing prediction models, dealing with categorical data, comparative effectiveness, and simulation-all in a high-dimensional setting-will be considered. The talk will introduce the work carried out by the group with respect to these areas, and will more closely discuss selected areas, such as exploratory data analysis and data reduction. Health systems turn to highly distributed, cross-organizational, regional or even international care settings including many different stakeholders from multiple knowledge and policy domains and integrating human actors, devices, applications or components. Standards and publicly available specifications as well as tools for managing the resulting interoperability challenges cannot be developed by one organization. Hereby, the seamless integration of specifications and artifacts from different organizations is crucial and so far insufficiently solved. The workshop, jointly organized by HL7 Germany and HL7 Austria and supported by activists engaged in ISO and CEN, will address the whole standards and product development and deployment lifecycle. It will help overcoming the existing problems with standards and specifications from different Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and guiding standards developers, designers, and implementers to improve their processes and outcomes. The principles, methodologies, requirements and solutions proposed in the workshop will be shared with the related SDOs and published in an international journal.",

Organizational, methodological and technological paradigm changes enable a personalized, predictive, preventive and participative approach to health and social services supported by a comprehensive set of domains managed by different scientific disciplines. Interoperability has to advance beyond ICT concerns, including the real world business domains and their processes, but also the individual context of all actors involved. So, the system must properly reflect the environment in front and around the computer as essential and even defining part of the health system. This paper introduces an ICT-independent system-theoretical, ontology-driven reference architecture model allowing the representation and harmonization of all domains involved including the transformation into an appropriate ICT design and implementation. The entire process is completely formalized and can therefore be fully automated. Abstract. In this paper we report on our findings arising from a qualitative, interview study of students' experiences in an undergraduate health informatics program. Our findings suggest that electronic health record competencies need to be integrated into an undergraduate curriculum. Participants suggested that there is a need to educate students about the use of the EHR, followed by best practices around interface design, workflow, implementation and safety with this work culminating in students spearheading the design of the technology as part of their educational program. Internationally, over the past several years researchers from around the world have been focused on varying aspects of patient safety and risk management to improve health information technology safety (HIT).",

Published as textual documents, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) didn't demonstrate to impact physician practices when disseminated in their original format. However, when computerized and embedded in clinical decision support systems, they appeared to be more effective. In order to ease the translation from textual to computerized CPGs, we have elaborated a fine-grained knowledge model of CPGs (FGKM) to be used when authoring CPGs. The work has been conducted on VIDALRecos \u00d2 CPGs. The building of the model has followed a bottom-up iterative process starting with 15 different CPGs. The first version of the FGKM has been assessed on two new complex CPGs, and was enriched by comparison with the Guideline Elements Model (GEM). The final version of the FGKM has been tested on the 2014 Hypertension CPGs. We compared the rules automatically derived from FGKM instances to those manually extracted from textual CPGs for decision support. Results showed that difficulties such as text normalization have to be solved. The FGKM is intended to be used upstream of the process of CPGs authoring in order to ease the implementation and the update of both textual and computerized CPGs.",

For the analysis of RT data we introduced an analysis platform [2] with diverse service-oriented analysis tools [3] . To show the successful technical realization of the mentioned objectives, a typical radiooncological use case has been selected as feasibility project. Radiation oncologists want to know, how much dose has been applied during primary treatment in the region of recurrence. First, the patient group has to be queried from the research database. Then, the RT data of primary and recurrence irradiation has to be collected and pre-processed for analysis. During analysis images from recurrence irradiation have to be registered with the original planning CT from primary irradiation. The resulting transformation can be assigned to the remaining primary RT data (e.g. segmented structures, planning parameters and dose distributions). Thereby the primary RT data is projected to the coordinates of the recurrence. Then, dose statistics and dose volume histograms (DVHs) can be calculated for each patient, which summarize the three-dimensional dose distribution and represent the irradiation at a glance. Finally, a statistical analysis is performed across all patients and corresponding diagrams are generated.",

Students and researchers do not often have the possibility to use productive application systems of e.g. hospitals or medical practices to gain practical experiences or examine new components and technologies. Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop a dedicated laboratory environment for patient health care and clinical research. Essential application systems were identified and a suitable architecture was designed for this purpose. It is accompanied by a teaching plan that considers learning modules for bachelor and master degrees in medical informatics. We implemented the laboratory environment called MI-Lab with multiple free and open source software components. All components are installed on virtual machines and/or Docker containers. This modular architecture creates a flexible system which can be deployed in various scenarios. The preliminary evaluation results suggests that laboratory environments like MI-Lab work well in teaching practical aspects of medical informatics and are widely accepted by students. ",

Superficial spreading melanoma is associated with a very good prognosis. In contrast, nodular melanoma has a much lower 5-year relative survival. It has also been observed that early stage melanoma with lower tumor thickness is associated with better prognosis than thick melanoma. Survival differences between the histological subtypes were discussed to be mainly caused by tumor stage, but so far relative survival of melanoma patients in Germany stratified by both T-stage and histological subtype is unknown. Objective To investigate relative survival from melanoma by T-stage for each histological subtype, stratified by sex. Methods Data from 12 German cancer registries are analyzed, covering a population of 28 million inhabitants. Patients with a diagnosis of primary melanoma (ICD-10: C43) in 1997-2012 are included whereas patients younger than 15 years and death certificate only (DCO) cases are excluded. Patients with multiple melanomas of different histologic subtypes contribute to all respective subgroups. Stage-specific 5-and 10-year relative survival are estimated by histologic subtype (superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, amelanotic melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous maligna melanoma, and other melanoma) for women and men.

The specification and customization of clinical document types are tasks that need a strong collaboration between domain experts and IT specialists. However, these collaborators are often faced with difficulties due to different interpretation of domain knowledge. Therefore, an adequate method for sharing domain knowledge about documents is necessary. Even though there are some tools that help to define medical document types, there is a lack of approaches that focus on the understandability of the specification for the domain experts. This paper proposes a modeling approach based on the Clinical Document Architecture to address this gap.",

The state has a total population of 3.3 million people [2] .",

Besides pulse rates, SBP was related to inversely and DBP, height, weight and BMI (kg/m 2 ) was positively related to gynecological age. Whereas, women who experienced early or late menopause had no relation to gynecological age with health behavior and mental health. Conclusion It is known, menopause age is determined genetically, not a related with socioeconomic position or environmental factor [9]. We show that gynecological age was related socioeconomic status, mental health, health behavior, obstetrics & gynecological history and anthropometry. Probably we determined that the father's education level was related childhood nutrition. Also, we estimated childhood nutrition status was related early age at menarche. In a previous study, middle-aged women's mental health was associated with early menopause [4] . However, in this study, women who experienced depressive symptom has no relate to gynecological age. Long-term gynecological age was related who has good scores on quality of life among normal age at menopause. Increasing hormone exposure was associated with body mass. Obese was related not only gynecological age also early age at menarche and late age at menopause. Interestingly the women who are overweight or more at their BMI and below the average or less of subjective body mass recognition have shorter gynecological age relatively than others. Unlike natural menopause group, the surgical menopause group does not have a full menstrual period. In previous studies it did not mediate to whole of gynecological age. This study suggests a gynecological age and epidemiological characteristics that are related to when they experienced natural menopause.",

The StuDoQ database covers more than 200 patient variables, including demographic characteristics, medical history, tumor features, comorbidities, behavioral risk factors, and outcomes. Prediction models were developed in a learning-sample of 3813 patients. To avoid overfitting and overly optimistic assessment of our prediction models, we used penalized logistic regression (ridge regression). Models were evaluated in a separate internal validation sample of 2294 patients. Discrimination, i.e. the ability to distinguish between patients with and without events, was assessed using the c statistic, i.e. the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Calibration was examined graphically by plotting observed frequencies versus predicted probabilities and numerically by means of Brier scores.",

Eligible study participants were 60 years and older, without need of nursing care (German long-term care legislation) and without cognitive impairments. The intervention included a reinforcement programme to strengthen health recommendations: participants of the intervention group had the choice to take part in the small group session programme ''Active Health Promotion in Old Age'' or in a preventive home visit programme or opt for no programme. The half-day group-sessions were provided by an interdisciplinary geriatric health educator team and included information on medical aspects of ageing, physical activity, healthy eating and social participation. Home visits comprised multidimensional assessment performed by a specially trained nurse. One-year follow-up results showed favourable effects in the intervention group in the use of preventive services and health behaviour [1] . The majority of the intervention group chose the programme ''Active Health Promotion in Old Age''. After completion of the RCT, members of the control group could also participate in this programme [2] . In addition to the 1-year follow-up, long-term analyses were performed based on the ITT principle (original randomisation), showing no significant differences [3] . Next, we examined long-term effects in participants and non-participants of the multicomponent intervention ''Active Health Promotion in Old Age'' (1st Prize German Preventative Award 2005) [4] .",

Nonetheless older people vary in health status, functional competences and limitations. Health-promoting preventative and therapeutic intervention programmes with the aim to propose tailored and thus effective interventions have to take these differences into account. The LUCAS Functional Ability Index (LUCAS-FAI) was developed to screen functional competence in senior citizens in the community setting. This validated self-reporting index includes pre-clinical markers and focusses equally on both, functional resources and restrictions to subdivide the heterogeneous group of older persons into the classes ROBUST, post-ROBUST, preFRAIL and FRAIL. The prognostic validity of the selfreporting index was investigated in the Longitudinal Urban Cohort Ageing Study (LUCAS). Survival analyses showed significant differences between these classes [1, 2] . One question to detect functional resources was: ''Please indicate if you are able to walk 500 meters''. Alternatively, we have also used a question on cycling instead. Despite many attempts to provide appropriate tools for supporting stroke patients in their care and rehabilitation processes, there is still room for improvement. We propose an online care and rehabilitation planning tool as a potential eHealth service for stroke patients. The aim is to study the care professionals' perceived usefulness of the planning tool. We developed and presented a functional prototype to a neurology team in Stockholm. Three focus groups were performed with the care professionals in the team and the data were analysed based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.Although care professionals mentioned challenges such as time limitation for using the tool and issues related to the responsibility of the system, they were positive towards the tool and its potential usefulness in ease of understanding the rehabilitation process and support for collaboration.",

Electronic medical records are very unique systems in which concepts with different levels of abstraction coexist. For instance, an EMR may contain individual temperature measurements as well as the concept of 'fever', which is of course an abstraction of a set of temperature measurements. Following that principle, we have built Clini-calTime, a system that allows researchers to visually express patients' phenotype using clinical intervals and instants as well as their temporal relationships. Here, we describe the use of Clini-calTime to identify patients with sepsis using the MIMIC II database. Methods MIMIC II is an anonymized database of clinical data containing information from in-tensive care unit episodes [2] . To create our dataset, we randomly selected 60 patient records. These records were blindly annotated by two clinicians according to the presence/absence of sepsis, defined as a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) of infectious origin [3] .

Predicting only cardiovascular mortality, discrimination performance of the commonly used ESC SCORE remained somewhat superior to the ACC/AHA risk score. Yet non-fatal events are of increasing importance given the decreased case-fatality of acute myocardial infarction. Considering this advantage, the recalibrated ACC/ AHA risk score provides a meaningful tool for estimating 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease in the German population. Clinical data is often captured in unstructured texts and scattered in different health information systems. This complicates the aggregation of information in the process of clinical decision making. However, having a quick overview and an efficient representation of relevant aspects of a patient's health status are crucial for this process. While accessing patient data and perusing clinical documents, relevant details need to be discovered quickly. In this paper, we introduce an approach to visualize relevant information from clinical documents by tag clouds. The conventional tag clouds visualize the content of a document using the terms they are containing shown in different sizes with the size calculated based on the term frequency. Important facts and diagnostic results with low occurrence in a text may be ignored by this na\u00efve method. In this paper, we therefore adapt the conventional tag clouds by information extraction and a guidelines-based classification schema, so that the clinical concerns can be visualized more correctly. The aspects are extracted according to a classification schema developed by clinical experts. We evaluate the approach on a set of radiology reports for cervical spine treatment.",

Current research has mainly concentrated on event recognition through concept mapping using from medical ontologies (UMLS, SNOMED CT) and gene relation detection in the biological context. However, the analysis of the patient status and the interaction between the patient status and a context event is still at the primary stage. In order to realize an efficient personalized treatment design and pathway planning, the correlation between a patient status and different types of clinical events should be analyzed. In this paper, we will provide a summary of the current research progress in clinical event detection in the biomedical domain and compare two approaches of event acquisition: an event schema produced using a guideline-based method and an expert-based annotation. We will apply the approaches to generate a structured annotation corpus and a special case of an event schema based on the complication classification and risk management in treatment of laryngeal cancer. Background Clinical trials are majorly performed in the western world to proof safety, efficiency, and efficacy of novel drugs or medical devices. For data capture and the comprehensive documentation, electronic systems are nowadays available. However, such systems are stand alone, not providing any interface for data exchange and system interconnections. In addition, image-or signal-based surrogates (imaging biomarkers) are acquired increasingly in those trials. Currently, this binary large objects (BLOB) data is also not integrated to the IT systems supporting clinical trials, since it is approaching big data volumes.",

We examined differences between the 16 German federal states in the prevalence of eight major cardiovascular risk factors separately and combined as the total number of risk factors per person. Risk factors were categorized as follows: physical inactivity (no regular sport in the last 3 month), smoking (current regular or occasional smokers), alcohol use (risky consumption), low fruit and vegetable intake (\\1 portion of fruit, vegetable or juice/day), obesity (BMI C 30 kg/m 2 ) and lifetime medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia or diabetes.

In comparison the network constructed on published HAT research is smaller and less connected with proportional more components and a smaller giant component (76.78 percent of the authors against 81.27 percent for Chagas). There is less research conducted in affected countries (8.5 % for HAT against 56.9 % for Chagas of the publication output).

DM patients typically visit different medical disciplines (our cohort visited care providers from a median of 4 different disciplines within one year), which entails a lower COC-index. However, this broader care spectrum may be more beneficial for them than visiting just one single care provider, where the latter would entail a high COC-index. Thus, a simple and reasonable interpretation of the COC-index would only be possible, if the COC-index was disentangled from the number of different medical disciplines, which a patient has visited.

We identified relevant competencies from national sources (step 1), matched and enriched these with input from the international literature (step 2) and fed the resulting 24 core competencies into a survey (120 invited experts from which 87 responded) and two focus group sessions with a total of 48 experts (steps 3a/3b).

In the eStandards project, 19 European case studies reporting from R&D and large-scale eHealth deployment and policy projects were analyzed. Although this study is not exhaustive, reflecting on the concepts, standards, and tools for concurrent use and the successes, failures, and lessons learned, this paper offers practical insights on how eHealth deployment projects can make the most of the available eHealth standards and tools and how standards and profile developing organizations can serve the users embracing sustainability and technical innovation.",

Substantial evidence supports the role of modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet in chronic disease risk (2). In observational studies the consumption of plant-based diets showed an association with reduced inflammatory profiles and subsequently lowered risk of chronic diseases (3). Plantbased diets are defined as dietary patterns that emphasize foods of plant origin, particularly vegetables, grains, legumes, and fruits (4). These diets generally exclude or rarely include meats, but may include dairy products, eggs, and fish. Variations of plant-based diets are Mediterranean (5), Nordic (6) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) (7) , for which previous studies found favorable associations with lower chronic disease risk. In this context, it could be hypothesized that plant-based dietary strategies may in fact prevent generation of a pro-inflammatory environment in the human organism, which may be one important mechanism linking healthy diets to reduced chronic disease risk. Therefore we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention trials in order to assess the effect of plant-based diets on inflammation-associated biomarker profiles. Methods Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for articles published in the period between January 1946 and January 2016. Eligibility criteria included: (1) participants older than 18 years of age; (2) plant-based dietary intervention; (3) data on mean differences in biomarkers between individuals consuming plant-based diets and those consuming control diets. Exclusion criteria were: (1) intervention trials \\4 weeks; (2) studies among pregnant women or terminally ill patients; (3) concomitant interventions; (4) interventions based on individual food components rather than on overall dietary patterns. Data collected included: study design, baseline characteristics of the study population, information on dietary interventions, and outcome assessment (biomarker measurements). Data were pooled using random-effects models and Heterogeneity was assessed by subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression. Evaluated biomarkers of inflammatory status were: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM), leptin, adiponectin and resistin.",

No substantial effects were revealed for the remaining biomarkers: TNF-a, resistin, adiponectin and leptin. Conclusion Plant-based diets are associated with an improvement in inflammatory profiles-as indicated by decreases in CRP and IL-6 concentrationsand could provide means for therapy and prevention of inflammationrelated chronic diseases. (1) . These include the work sites perform in the trial as well as work the coordinating center performs in managing sites. Site work includes identifying potential subjects, verifying that subjects meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria, conducting study procedures, and collecting study subject's baseline and follow-up information. Many site-based activities revolve around the collection and reporting of clinical trial information and potentially could be enhanced through information technologies. Secondary data collection A major breakthrough in clinical trial operations occurred when a Swedish group used national cardiovascular registries to collect and management clinical trial data (2). This and other government initiatives led to interest in the secondary use of registry and/or patient billing data in clinical trials. However, the secondary use of existing data is associated with limitations in study design and may raise issues regarding data quality. eSource For at least a decade, researchers have explored the use of e-source technologies to populate study data sets by capturing data directly from electronic medical record systems (3). More recently, standards and methodologies such as Retrieve Form for Data Capture (RFD) and Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) seek to overcome many limitations of secondary data use for clinical trials while retaining most of the benefits. However, these methods require set-up that may place a burden on informatics-na\u00efve sites. Data quality Data quality issues are important considerations with any data collection method, more so recently for health record data. Concerns over the quality of health record data have deep roots (4, 5, 6) . Current interest is focused on problems created by the inability of most emerging data capture methods to provide for data validation and correction. Two distinct modes of data collection exist (1) collection of existing data for some secondary use, and (2) collection of new data for some primary or secondary use. Data quality assessment methods are needed in both cases. Data quality assurance and control methods should be applied in the latter case. We present a framework that covers both cases, and as such is applicable over the wide range of proposed and existing methods for the collection of EHR data for use in clinical studies. Ethics and regulatory Ethical and regulatory issues underlie each data capture and data quality issue associated with the use of new medical informatics technologies in clinical trials. If registry, billing or electronic medical record data are repurposed for clinical trials, do patients and regulators need to be informed and do they need to consent? If so, in which situations is this required and how will it be obtained? Summary In this workshop, we will review technical, data quality and ethical/ regulatory issues associated with using medical informatics to improve clinical trial operations. Workshop participants will contribute to this work and help set an agenda for a subsequent workshop planned for the Information Technology and Communication in Health (ITCH) 2017 Conference in Victoria, BC.",

The analysis assumes data from a randomized parallel group design. We use non-parametric density estimators to construct an ROC curve based on the probabilities that a (non-)responder, defined by better (worse) response to treatment as opposed to control, in the treatment group has a biomarker value above a value c. Our non-parametric approach comes close to the true AUC in a simulation study based on a normal distribution. Application to a real data set shows that despite a significant interaction term in a proportional hazards model, a biomarker may not be helpful for treatment decisions. Our proof of principle study opens the door to further developments and generalizations.",

As demonstrated recently by results of a population-based study, IUGR is the single largest risk factor for stillbirth, increasing the stillbirth rate fourfold than compared to pregnancies with normal growth, and if antenatally undetected increases further to eightfold [2] . Therefore early detection of IUGR is of core importance for maternal and child health. However, observational studies from the late 1990s and early 2000 reported antenatal detection rates of 25-30 % for suboptimal fetal growth (i.e. IUGR) through routine fetal ultrasonography [3, 4] . Possible reasons for the antenatal non-detection of IUGR have not been well elucidated yet. The aim of this study was to describe the sensitivity of antenatal detection of IUGR and to investigate if there are specific groups having a higher chance of non-detected IUGR (e.g. women with a migrant background).",

Clinical trials compared RVX to warfarin, but not to the standard of care in Germany, phenprocoumon (PPC). Recent insights regarding defective devices used to measure blood clotting rates in the control group of these trials raised new questions about the risk of bleeding associated with RVX as compared to standard drugs. The aim of this study was to characterize new users of RVX versus PPC in Germany and to assess and compare bleeding rates in both groups using claims data. Methods Based on data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) from 2011 to 2013 a cohort of new users of RVX or PPC was established. Comedication, comorbidity, potential indication as well as the thromboembolic and the bleeding risk scores (CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED) were assessed. Crude incidence rates (IRs) per 1,000 person years (PY) were estimated for any bleeding leading to hospitalization and the sub-types intracerebral, gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeding. A nested case-control analysis (NCCA) will be applied to compare the adjusted risk of these bleeding events between new users of RVX and PPC using conditional logistic regression.",

The CHA2DS2-VASc was lower in RVX users while HAS-BLED was similar in both groups. The overall crude bleeding rates were slightly lower in new RVX users compared to new PPC users (overall IR: 17.58 per 1,000 PY (95 % CI 15.98-19.29) vs. 19.60 per 1,000 PY (18.43-20.83)).

Data Warehouses (DWH) as central data repository systems play a key role by providing standardized, high-quality and secure medical data for effective analyses. However, DWHs in medicine must fulfil various requirements concerning data privacy and the ability to describe the complexity of (rare) disease phenomena. Here, i2b2 and tranSMART are free alternatives representing DWH solutions especially developed for medical informatics purposes. But different functionalities are not yet provided in a sufficient way. In fact, data import and export is still a major problem because of the diversity of schemas, parameter definitions and data quality which are described variously in each single clinic. Further, statistical analyses inside i2b2 and tranSMART are possible, but restricted to the implemented functions. Thus, data export is needed to provide a data basis which can be directly included within statistics software like SPSS and SAS or data mining tools like Weka and RapidMiner. The standard export tools of i2b2 and tranSMART are more or less creating a database dump of key-value pairs which cannot be used immediately by the mentioned tools. They need an instance-based or a case-based representation of each patient. To overcome this lack, we developed a concept called Generic Case Extractor (GCE) which pivots the key-value pairs of each clinical fact into a roworiented format for each patient sufficient to enable analyses in a broader context. Therefore, complex Patients and methods RNA expression of genes depicting the p53 pathway (p14ARF, MDM2, p21, BAX and HMGA2) were studied in tumor tissues of 208 HNSCC patients. Network analysis was used to characterize the relation between genetic biomarker, acting upstream (p14ARF, HMGA2, MDM2) and downstream (p21, BAX) of the tumor suppressor p53. Multiple imputation was used to fill in missing values of gene expressions and covariates, creating a total of 5 data sets. Gaussian graphical models within a bootstrap approach were then applied to access the structure of the gene expression network [4] . The final network was generated using a model which counts how often an edge is detected in 10,000 bootstrap network replications. The effect of the p14ARF network on human papilloma virus infection (HPV) status and patient survival (overall survival and tumor-specific survival) was determined using logistic and Cox regression models for a follow-up time of 6-8 years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Principal component analysis was conducted to summarize the gene expression profile of a network and its effect on patient survival.",

It is an early marker of impaired renal function. The aim of this project was to identify genetic loci that are associated with apoA-IV concentrations based on a hypothesis-free genomewide approach and to investigate a possible relation with already known susceptibility loci for related traits (kidney function, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Methods A genome-wide association meta-analysis was conducted with about 10 Mio. SNPs using data from five population-based cohorts (n = 13813) followed by a replication step in two additional studies (n = 2267). To account for possible heterogeneity, a fixed effects or random effects model was used to associate each SNP with apoA-IV concentrations. Additionally, a look-up of the replicated SNPs in downloadable GWA meta-analysis results was performed on kidney function (defined by eGFR), chronic kidney disease, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Moreover, weighted SNP-scores were built involving already known susceptibility loci for the aforementioned traits and were associated with apoA-IV concentrations. All apoA-IV measurements were done by ELISA centrally in one laboratory.",

These test characteristics are usually estimated by comparing the imperfect test with a gold standard. However, in many cases a gold standard does not exist. By applying several tests simultaneously to the same samples, the class membership and consequently the performance of each test can be estimated under certain conditions via latent class analysis (LCA) based on the joint probability of observed result patterns. However, among the many publications applying LCA in the field of diagnostic testing, most publications appear to focus rather on the technical implementation without considering questions relevant for safe practical applications: (1) Is the common mandatory assumption of conditional independence of the diagnostic tests realistic? (2) Can a unique solution be identified (identifiability)?",

Self-reported daily activity limitation is assessed via the Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI) based on a single question with answering categories ''severely limited/limited but not severely/not limited at all.'' In the present analysis, people reporting severe limitations were considered as limited. A modification of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPBBmod) (Guralnik 1994) was used to measure physical functioning. SPBBmod is based on Timed-up and Go-Test, Chair-Rise-Test and Balance-Tests. Test-based limitations of physical functioning were defined as a SPPBmod score of 8 or lower. Data on 1,707 community-dwelling people aged 65 to 79 years participating in DEGS1 with full records on GALI and SPBBmod were analysed. 21 chronic conditions and seeing and hearing limitations were assessed. Multimorbidity was defined as having 3 or more of these conditions. Agreement and disagreement between GALI and SPPBmod was assessed with descriptive methods and the kappa statistic was calculated. Participants who show limitations in SPPBmod but do not consider themselves as severely limited were considered as particularly vulnerable. Among persons with limitations in SPPBmod, we identified characteristics of this potentially vulnerable subgroup using multivariable logistic regression analysis with self-reported severe activity limitation (no vs. yes) as the outcome and chronic health conditions, recurrent falls, social support and education as independent variables.

Then a patient's smartwatch fetches the current plan via web services and reminds the patient to take the prescribed drug.

The Ligurian Vaccination in HIV Program is a proposed vaccination schedule specifically dedicated to this risk group. Selective strategies are proposed within this program, employing ICT (Information and Communication) tools to identify this susceptible target group, to monitor immunization coverage over time and to manage failures and defaulting. The proposal is to connect an immunization registry system to an existing regional platform that allows clinical data re-use among several medical structures, to completely manage the vaccination process. This architecture will adopt a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach and standard HSSP (Health Services Specification Program) interfaces to support interoperability. According to the presented solution, vaccination administration information retrieved from the immunization registry will be structured according to the specifications within the immunization section of the HL7 (Health Level 7) CCD (Continuity of Care Document) document. Immunization coverage will be evaluated through the continuous monitoring of serology and antibody titers gathered from the hospital LIS (Laboratory Information System) structured into a HL7 Version 3 (v3) Clinical Document Architecture Release 2 (CDA R2).",

Methods A panel of gamification experts constructed an initial list of terms commonly used when describing gamification elements. The initial list was revised and refined to remove terms that were too broad or too specific (ie: ''explore'' or ''on-boarding''). A randomized sample of 50 apps for health description was produced from the Medical category of the iTunes App Store. These descriptions were given to a gamification expert for detecting the presence of gamification elements and used as gold standard. The descriptions were automatically searched for matches with the initial and final list of gamification keywords. Any match considered the description to belong to a gamified app. A Fleiss-Kappa analysis was done to check reliability with both lists.",

From a preventive point of view it is hence important to identify women with increased stress levels. To date it is unknown whether and how stress levels change during pregnancy and which characteristics are associated with higher levels of prenatal stress. Our objective was to examine perceived stress over the course of pregnancy and associated socioeconomic and psychometric factors in a cohort of healthy pregnant women from Hamburg, Germany. Methods Data from 335 women participating in the pilot study of the PRINCE (Prenatal Identification of Children Health) cohort, a populationbased prospective cohort study, was used for the present analyses. Once per trimester the women completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the SF12 regarding physical and psychological aspects of quality of life. Furthermore, data regarding socioeconomic factors, social support (Berlin Social Support Scale) as well as coping strategies (brief COPE Health-exploring complexity: an interdisciplinary systems approach HEC2016 S65 inventory) was assessed once during pregnancy. For analyses, the study population was allocated into quartiles yielding groups of low (1st quartile; n = 84), medium (2nd and 3rd quartile; n = 167) and high (4th quartile; n = 83) mean perceived stress and the three groups were compared with regard to socioeconomic and psychometric characteristics using ANOVA for normally distributed continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis test for not normally distributed continuous variables and Chi square test for categorical variables.",

Bivariate analysis revealed that variables of SES were not significantly associated with any form of stress. Women with migration history had a significantly higher number of children (p \\ .05), lower educational levels (p \\ .001), and lower household net incomes (p \\ .001). Furthermore, they reported a significantly lower prevalence of subjective chronic stress (p \\ 05) compared to participants without migration history.

For acute stress however, none of the tested possible influencing factors were significant. Conclusion Women experienced a considerable burden of acute and chronic stress in pregnancy. Migrants were experiencing significantly less chronic stress than non-migrants, in spite of their significantly lower SES. Low SES did not contribute to maternal stress in this population. Additional research is needed to study other factors such as personality and health status to better understand chronic and acute stress in pregnancy.

This limits our possibilities to design better interventions. Process evaluations can be used to improve this understanding by assessing fidelity and quality of implementation, clarifying causal mechanisms, and identifying contextual factors associated with variation in outcomes. Coiera describes the intervention process as a series of stages extending from interactions to outcomes: the ''information value chain''. However, past process evaluations often did not assess the relationships between those stages. In this paper we argue that the chain can be measured quantitatively and unobtrusively in digital interventions thanks to the availability of electronic data that are a byproduct of their use. This provides novel possibilities to study the mechanisms of informatics interventions in detail and inform essential design choices to optimize their efficacy.",

Of these 13 archetypes, 3 have been obtained from the international archetype repository of the openEHR foundation. The remaining 10 archetypes have been newly created.

According to previous research MAP physiologically increases with growth, which in turn enhances elastic properties and compliance of arteries despite an accompanying ageand BP-dependent rise in arterial stiffening. This effect on vascular structure and function might explain our finding that PWV remained constant and will probably start to show a noticeable increase with onset of puberty. Our results emphasize the usefulness not only of routine BP measurements in early childhood but moreover of measuring PWV in order to evaluate arterial function. Research questions should focus on further clinical and lifestyle risk factors potentially influencing PWV in healthy young children. ",

The HPV test doesn't indicate dormant HPV infections reliably. The effect of the HPV vaccination into a dormant HPV infection to the actual effect on the formation of a dysplasia is therefore unclear. It can also be observed that further HPV types in high SIL are detected, even though these are not officially classified as high SIL. These HPV types are currently not detected using the common HPV tests and are not included in the new advanced vaccination. If the development of further new high risk HPV types continues it is questionable if a HPV-screening-program can withstand the HPV mutation, while morphological diagnostics are unaffected and malignancy criteria remain consistent. It is through morphological diagnostics such high SIL are detected. Thus the importance of gynecological screening with morphological diagnostics becomes apparent. ",

It involves the analysis of routinely collected oral health care records from health insurances in six European countries, including the National Health Service (NHS) England and NHS Scotland. It is planned to store the data in a central repository. The use of sensitive medical records is dependent on data usage agreements, each of which underlies different national data protection and privacy regulations. The result is that the requirements for data aggregation differ between the European partners. While some regulations may allow the use of a pseudonymised patient identifier, other requires anonymisation before the data can be used in a central repository. Hence, a flexible workflow for the integration of routinely collected insurance data in a central repository must be established.

The ongoing OMS trial investigates different questions related to OMS and potentially underlying neuroblastomas. In order to support this trial with an adequate IT infrastructure, linkage of neuroblastoma research databases with the OMS electronic data capture system was required. Therefore, an EDC system for the OMS trial has been developed and integrated into the research infrastructure of the European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents (ENCCA) project. Application of ENNCA's pseudonymization concept enabled linkage of the OMS trial with neuroblastoma trials from two different scientific societies, while being compliant with current data protection regulations. Linkage of the neurological and the oncological domain could successfully be demonstrated and a promising concept for secondary use of the data of both domains has been developed, proofing the broad potential of the concepts for cross domain research as promoted in the ENCCA project.

Furthermore, patterns of prescriptions in 2015 relating to age, duration and administrative districts were examined.

Numbers of prescriptions regarding the tranquilizers bromazepam (47.300 [2006]/ 23.561 [2014] , -50 %), diazepam (67.800/41.875, -38 %) and oxazepam (57.600/25.362, -56 %) indicated that these BZD still are popular but prescription numbers declined continuously through the years. Lorazepam was prescribed most frequently with an increasing number of prescriptions (65.089/72.477, ?12 %). Prescriptions of BZD applied as hypnotics were also declining during the analyzed period: lormetazepam (34.842/15.894, -54 %), nitrazepam (21.400/ 7.790, -64 %), temazepam (29.242/11.295, -55 %). In case of Z-hypnotics, zolpidem tended towards decreasing numbers of prescriptions (62.378/51.291, -17 %) whereas zopiclone seems to be favoured more and more by practitioners (71.044/79.167, ?11 %). Besides tranquilizers and hypnotics, tetrazepam was prescribed extensively with an increasing number of prescriptions (71.500/ 82.800, ?12 % [2012]) thus representing the most frequently used BZD until 2013. There were no striking changes in prescription patterns of other BZD since discontinuation of tetrazepam. Despite existence of pertinent recommendations in 2015 the vast majority of BZD and Z-hypnotics turned out to be prescribed to patients between 70-80 years old. Indication was not of relevance since both hypnotics (short acting) and tranquilizers (mid-long/long acting) were prescribed likewise to this group. In contrast, tetrazepam and diazepam were found to be prescribed particularly to people aging 45-50 years. Percentage of patients receiving prescriptions of BZD permanently (periods of [2 quarters) averaged out 19 % in 2014. Distinct differences in numbers of prescribed BZD and Z-hypnotics amongst various areas consistent with a general north-south-divide became evident. No seasonal variations in prescriptions were noticed. Conclusion This analysis revealed an overuse of BZD and more and more of Z-hypnotics that has to be questioned especially with respect to the fact that the majority of this substances is prescribed to elderly patients. Thus, there is still a need to develop programs reducing uncritical prescription of BZD.",

They facilitate individualized outcome prognostication conditional on covariates as well as adjustments of estimated effects of risk factors on the outcome by covariates. Theory of statistical models is wellestablished if the set of covariates to consider is fixed and small, such that we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10-30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. In recent decades many statisticians have extensively studied variable selection procedures for various purposes, e.g., for adjusting the effect of a risk factor of interest for confounders or other covariates, for hypothesis testing, or for deriving multivariable prediction models. In this talk, we will exemplify application of variable selection using scientific questions and data from real medical studies with continuous and censored survival endpoints. Using these examples and simulated data, we will discuss implications of variable selection, e.g., on bias and uncertainty of the final model. We demonstrate how resampling methods can help to quantify these instability issues in real-life data analyses. Currently, routine software implementations largely ignore instability issues caused by variable selection. We advocate the implementation of resampling methods in routine software such that applied researchers can get aware of instabilities in the finally selected model, in particular if they apply variable selection to too small data sets.",

Still, genome-wide data usually comprises millions of SNPs and a corresponding DBN would require an unrealistic amount of training samples to be efficient.

The most frequent diagnoses are tension-type headaches and migraine. An important question for epidemiological studies is whether or not it is possible to classify children with those diagnoses based on questionnaire data. Several pain-related characteristics are surmised to be different between children with migraine; intensity, frequency, painquality (pulsating vs. pressing), and accessory symptoms (nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light). The aim of the present study was to investigate the utility of questionnaire ratings of these individual characteristics in identifying children who suffer from migraine. Methods 795 patients (72 % female; mean age = 15 years, standard deviation 2 years) admitted to a tertiary pain clinic participated in the study. Children that were diagnosed as having migraine (irrespective of additional diagnoses) were contrasted to those children that were not diagnosed as having migraine. Diagnosis was made by an experienced pain-therapist after a 1.5 h-interview with children and parents. Data on pain-characteristics mentioned in the IHS-criteria (intensity, frequency, pain-quality rhythm, pain-quality affect, days missed school, pain-related disability, number of accessory symptoms) was collected via questionnaire before the interview (both children and parents reported characteristics). First, the individual characteristics were tested for significant differences between children with and without migraine and expressed as effect sizes. Second, Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC)-analysis were used to determine the diagnostic utility of the individual characteristics. Third, two separate decision trees-one for children and one for parents-were developed. In order to avoid overfitting the depth of the tree was based on 50 replications of ten-fold stratified cross-validation. Diagnostic utility of classification was measured by the area under the curve (AUC) within the full sample and out of sample as estimated by cross-validation.",

(Bio-) medical ontologies like Orphanet Rare Diseases Ontology (ORDO) or the Human Disease Ontology (DOID) provide a high number of concepts, synonyms and entity relationship properties. Such standard terminologies increase quality and granularity of input data by adding comprehensive semantic background knowledge from validated entity relationships. Moreover, cross-references between terminology concepts facilitate data integration across databases using different coding standards. In order to encourage the use of standard terminologies, our aim is to identify and link relevant concepts with freetext diagnosis inputs within a biobank registry. Relevant concepts are selected automatically by lexical matching and SPARQL queries against a RDF triplestore. To ensure correctness of annotations, proposed concepts have to be confirmed by medical data administration experts before they are entered into the registry database. Relevant (bio-) medical terminologies describing diseases and phenotypes were identified and stored in a graph database which was tied to a local biobank registry. Concept recommendations during data input trigger a structured description of medical data and facilitate data linkage between heterogeneous systems. ",

In particular, the workshop participants will build on their first-hand experience of using interactive visualization to discover segmentation and patterns from open data. After the breakout session, each group will report on their experiences and assessment on the pros and cons of such methods for wellness and decision support. The workshop will be concluded with a short presentation that showcases action maps going forward to present current and future self for decision support. Cloud computing is a model of self-service on-demand network access enabling delivering computing resources and services. Contemporary forecasts show that the technology is simultaneously evolving and maturing, the healthcare cloud market is expected to grow by one third of CAGR through to 2018. For companies transitioning their enterprise operations to the cloud, the technology brings a variety of opportunities and challenges, which were identified with our systematic literature review (Management, Technology, Security, Legislative). Consequently, using case study review, the research provides interesting insights emphasizing cloud complexity and superposition which seems to balance potential organizational limitations. Furthermore, results give an overview on the healthcare areas, where cloud computing has already undergone significant development (bioinformatics) or is expected to widen in the near future (cardiology).",

This allowed a quasi external (domain) validation of the developed score.The remaining patients were used for recalculation of the currently used scores and for the new development. Recalculation was done by logistic regression using the original risk factors and their transformations. For the development of the new score, logistic regression combined with best subset selection or backward reduction and lasso regression was used. 20 of the 28 initially considered risk factors (including medication) were selected for the data driven parameter selection algorithms.

In this analysis we assess whether the concept model of SNOMED CT comply with the documentation needs within this clinical domain. Attributes from the follow-up template of the clinical quality registry for Danish Head and Neck Cancer, and their respective value sets were mapped to SNOMED CT using existing mapping guidelines. Results show that post-coordination is important to represent specific types of value sets, such as absence of findings and severities. The concept model of SNOMED CT was found suitable for representing the value sets of this material. We argue for the development of further mapping guidelines for consistent post-coordination and for initiatives that demonstrate use of this important terminological feature in actual SNOMED CT implementations.",

Commonly, reference intervals for a parameter of interest are defined as its 2.5th and 97.5th percentile in the healthy population. Recently, quantile regression has received increasing attention as a tool for reference interval calculation, because percentiles (e.g. 2.5th and 97.5th) can be directly modeled. A further advantage of quantile regression is the potential for individualized reference intervals by introducing variables such as age, sex, smoking status and body mass index into the model. Thus, reference intervals of a parameter can be given for subgroups of interest. Furthermore, fractional polynomials can be used to model non-linear associations between explanatory variables e.g. age and the respective percentile of the outcome.",

Background and aims In Germany, among patients with (sporadic) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) Legionella spp. belongs to the most important causative agents (''community-acquired Legionnaires' disease'', CALD). Due to underreporting and lack of source identification, it is unknown how many cases of CALD are due to contaminated drinking water in residential plumbing systems. The recently reformed drinking water ordinance is aimed at reducing Legionella contamination in plumbing systems of residential buildings, excluding the household level. The aims of the study are (1) to estimate how frequently community-acquired pneumonias are caused by Legionella, (2) to examine how frequently the case-specific source of infection can be identified, and (3) to investigate among cases of CALD acquired at home to what extent (i) host (e.g. profession, behavior), (ii) environmental (drinking water contamination), and (iii) Legionella strain characteristics contribute to CALD acquisition through residential drinking water at home. Methods This prospective case-control study will take place from 2016-2019 in the German states of Berlin and Brandenburg. We will cooperate with hospitals to estimate the proportion of CAP that is CALD as well as to identify the causative strain of Legionella. After identification and reporting of a case of CALD, in cooperation with local health departments, the German Environment Agency and the Reference Laboratory for Legionella, we will initiate the following investigations: (1) extensive case interview, (2) sampling and assessment of the drinking water plumbing system of the case, (3) sampling of potential other sources of infection. We will attempt to match environmental with case patients' Legionella cultures through typing methods. Two controls will be matched for age (5-year age-groups), sex, smoking status, comorbidities and district. Controls will undergo the same questionnaire and environmental investigations as done for cases. Expected Results Percentage of CAP that is CALD, (2) Percentage of CALD with identified (typable) Legionella strain, (3) Percentage of CALD that is due to contaminated residential drinking water (CALD-DW), (4) Risk factors for CALD-DW, such as contamination on household level versus contamination on house plumbing system outside the household level, (5) Estimation of CALD that is preventable through full implementation of the drinking water ordinance. Expected Conclusion It is hoped that the anticipated results will allow drawing conclusions about the causal distribution of CALD and contribute to optimize the application of the drinking water ordinance.",

Based on literature we have constructed a model that describes these concepts and that guided the development of a questionnaire investigating COUMT adoption. The questionnaire was sent to staff working with patient data or records in seven out of eight Dutch university hospitals. Results show high willingness of end-users to comply to COUMT in the care process. End-users agree that COUMT is important, and that they want to work in a structured and standardized way. However, end-users indicate to not actually use terminology or information standards, but often register diagnoses and procedures in free text, and experience repeated recording of data. In conclusion, we found that COUMT is currently well adopted in mind, but not yet in practice.",

Differentiation between SIRS and sepsis, however, is difficult in a clinical setting as the SIRS definition is part of the diagnostic criteria for sepsis. Furthermore, age-specific changes in symptoms and laboratory parameters hinder the differentiation of both entities in pediatric patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model for the discrimination of sepsis and SIRS in critically ill children based on routinely available parameters. Methods Sepsis and SIRS defined by the international pediatric sepsis consensus conference (IPSCC) criteria were evaluated in a secondary data analysis based on a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a German tertiary-care hospital (ClinicalTrials.gov number; NCT00209768). We identified 238 episodes of SIRS and 58 episodes of sepsis in the 807 children aged 0 to 18 years originally enrolled in the RCT. Fifty predictor variables (demographic information, clinical parameters, laboratory parameters) measured at the first day of disease were considered as potential predictors for a diagnostic model. We used a Random Forest approach for classification and applied a temporal split-sample approach in order to validate the developed model. Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), i.e., the ability of microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites to resist the actions of one or more antimicrobial drugs or agents, is a serious global threat. Bacterial antibiotic resistance poses the largest threat to public health. The prevention of antimicrobial infections and their spread relies heavily on infection control management, and requires urgent, coordinated action by many stakeholders. This is especially true for nosocomial infections, also known as healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), i.e., infections that are acquired in healthcare settings. It is known that continuous, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data relevant to nosocomial infections and feedback for the use by doctors and nurses can reduce the frequency of these infections. Data from one hospital are more valid and more effective when they are compared with those from other hospitals. In order to avoid false conclusions, comparisons are only possible when identical methods of data collection with fixed diagnostic definitions are used. The automatic aggregation of standardized data using data from electronic medical records (EMRs), lab data, surveillance data and data on antibiotic use would greatly enhance comparison and computerized decision support systems (CDSSs). Once standardized, data can be aggregated from unit to institutional, regional, national and EU level, analysed and fed back to enhance local decision support on antibiotic use and detection of nosocomial infections.",

The summarized weighting is reduced by the number of tokens not used. The resulting mapping was validated by a manual comparison of searched and detected name.",

Another issue is that some products can be used for multiple indications and some drugs contain multiple ingredients, representing different ATC codes. Further, medication names usually contain a specific ingredient quantity, e.g. '40 mg'. The export name might, however, include adaptions, e.g. '20 mg'. Often, if available in catalog, this quantity was mapped correctly, but not reliably. Thus, a medication export/catalog mapping based on these names does not lead to a full catalog mapping. As a consequence, further catalog attributes might not be usable; for linkage with ATC codes, however, this approach is fully sufficient.

This comprehensive information is necessary to support diagnosis and treatment, care quality measurement, improvement of public health, improving the productivity of health care and facilitating reimbursement. One of the important services is speech therapy that is of value to patients with speech and voice problems. Providing data that often collected via standard forms and presented to users is crucial for speech therapy services. Such forms must be designed appropriately. Therefore, a standard form should have the following characteristics; appropriate physical and logical structure, useful data, prevent entering duplicate data and etc. Since no appropriate forms were available in Iran, one limitation has been the lack of standards for presenting and exchanging such data.

The ultimate goal of this work was to establish a standard form for recording and reporting speech language pathology data, which will in turn facilitate the establishment of such databases. Issues related to ensuring patient privacy and data ownership in clinical repositories prevent the growth of translational research. Previous studies have used an aggregator agent to obscure clinical repositories from the data user, and to ensure the privacy of output using statistical disclosure control. However, there remain several issues that must be considered. One such issue is that a data breach may occur when multiple nodes conspire. Another is that the agent may eavesdrop on or leak a user's queries and their results. We have implemented a secure computing method so that the data used by each party can be kept confidential even if all of the other parties conspire to crack the data. We deployed our implementation at three geographically distributed nodes connected to a high-speed layer two network. The performance of our method, with respect to processing times, suggests suitability for practical use. Achieving a good understanding of the socio-technical system in critical or emergency situations is important for patient safety. Research in human-computer interaction in the field of anesthesia or surgery has the potential to improve usability of the user interfaces and enhance patient safety. Therefore eye-tracking is a technology for analyzing gaze patterns. It can also measure what is being perceived by the physician during medical procedures. The aim of this review is the applicability of eye-tracker in the domain of simulated or real environments of anesthesia, surgery or intensive care. We carried out a literature research in PubMed. Two independent researchers screened the titles and abstracts. The remaining 8 full-papers were analyzed based on the applicability of eye-trackers. The articles contain topics like training of surgeons, novice vs. experts or the cognitive workload. None of the publications address our goal. The applicability or limitations of the eye-tracker technology were stated incidentally. ",

Prevalence data in this setting vary between 25 and 80 %, presumably due to different definitions and population characteristics. Since there is rare evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to prevent joint contractures in nursing home residents, attention should be better paid on the relief of negative impact of joint contractures on daily life. From the patients' perspective, restrictions in social participation are most burdensome. These may result from the accumulation of various factors, from changes in body function and structures to debilitating environmental factors, such as design of living areas or attitudes of health care professionals. An effective intervention has to reflect this complexity. We therefore aimed to develop a complex intervention to improve participation and quality of life in nursing home residents with joint contractures.",

Module three provides measures to support nursing home residents with joint contractures in participation and quality of life. Module four presents methods of collegial consulting and training. The second component of the intervention is a presentation dealing with knowledge about joint contractures lasting approximately 40 min. Addresses are nursing home staff, residents and relatives. In a third and fourth component of the intervention, nurses will be supported by telephone counselling and collegial peer-review to discuss practical patient-related issues. The implementation process will be documented to describe underlying mechanisms in relation to context, setting, professionals and residents. For this purpose, questionnaires before and after the workshop and a diary to document nurses experiences during the intervention period will be used. The next step is to evaluate the complex intervention in a clusterrandomized pilot study with seven nursing homes in two regions in Germany. The pilot study will be accompanied by a comprehensive process evaluation to assess the barriers and facilitators of successful implementation of the intervention and thus to provide sufficient information for planning a main trial.",

Modern high-quality education is based on guaranteed, structured and well-balanced curricula covering the necessary scope of knowledge and skills required in subsequent practice, which respond to changing epidemiological profiles, health systems challenges and population health needs. The general idea is to obtain vector representations of words included in descriptions of disciplines, represent the textual content in a vector space (word2vec in particular) and visualise the results of similarity analysis as an interactive web-based report. We present the findings of the real application of the word2vec approach on curriculum data and reflect on its implications in the long-term process of curriculum innovation. The paper describes an appealing way of exploring that can be helpful to anyone who is involved in the complicated and time-consuming process of curriculum design at institutions of higher education.

Moreover, some surgical procedures may cause more adhesions than others with subsequent increased risk of bowel obstruction (1, 4, 6) . In most countries, identifying persons with a relatively rare condition as bowel obstruction can be a challenge due to lack of systematic registration requiring exhaustive efforts for the investigators. Denmark has an extensive collection of national and disease-specific registries with unique information on patient level (7, 8) . The personal identification (CPR) number attached to every Danish citizen makes it is possible to link data from multiple data sources, facilitating registerbased research (9).

To examine the incidence of bowel obstruction after caesarean sections, we retrieved data from the Danish Medical Birth Registry (13), where information on all births in Denmark is registered (i.e. number of births, birth outcome, maternal risk factors and complications). Data from the Danish Hysterectomy and Hysteroscopy Database (DHHD) (14) were extracted to investigate the risk of bowel obstruction after hysterectomy and also, to investigate the risk of bowel obstruction after different surgery methods. In DHHD, detailed information about women undergoing hysterectomy from 2003 and forward is registered including indications, type of surgical procedure, complications, comorbidity, life style factors, re-admissions and morbidity. This large amount of data retrieved from various Danish health and social registries renowned for their comprehensive and high quality data with very little selection bias (7, 8) , enables us to do time-to-event analyses with bowel obstruction as outcome. The data also allow comprehensive descriptive unbiased analyses on gynaecological surgical procedures over time in the Danish female population.",

Discharge letters are an important means of communication between physicians and nurses from intensive care units and their colleagues from normal wards. The patient data management system (PDMS) used at our local intensive care units provides an export tool to create discharge letters by inserting data items from electronic medical records into predefined templates. Local intensivists criticized the limitations of this tool regarding the identification and the further processing of clinically relevant data items for a flexible creation of discharge letters. As our PDMS supports Arden Syntax, and the demanded functionalities are well within the scope of this standard, we set out to investigate the suitability of Arden Syntax for the generation of discharge letters. To provide an easy-to-understand facility for integrating data items into document templates, we created an Arden Syntax interface function which replaces the names of previously defined variables with their content in a way that permits arbitrary custom formatting by clinical users. Our approach facilitates the creation of flexible text sections by conditional statements, as well as the integration of arbitrary HTML code and dynamically generated graphs. The resulting prototype enables clinical users to apply the full set of Arden Syntax language constructs to identify and process relevant data items in a way that far exceeds the capabilities of the PDMS export tool. The generation of discharge letters is an uncommon area of application for Arden Syntax, considerably differing from its original purpose. However, we found our prototype well suited for this task and plan to evaluate it in clinical production after the next major release change of our PDMS. Background Ischemic heart disease is the most important cause of death in Germany, where hypertension is one of the most important risk factor. Among children, bronchitis is one of the most common acute disease and asthma the most common chronic disease. We investigated the influence of road traffic noise C55db(A), socioeconomic and -demographic risk factors classified with a number of indicators to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based score resulting in the new variable ''social burden'', physician density as a surrogate measurement for health access, and the proportion of people aged 65 or older on prevalence rates of heart insufficiency and hypertension. Additionally, the influence of road traffic noise C55db(A), social burden, and physician density was analyzed on prevalence rates of acute bronchitis and asthma in children aged 14 or younger. Methods All disease data and information on social indicators were obtained from the Central research institute of ambulatory health care in Germany and from the Statistical Office for Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. To determine the affected population by noise C55db(A), a road traffic noise map was overlayed with a population map and the affected area fractions were calculated and scaled in percent. We modeled associations between potential risk factors and district prevalence of heart insufficiency, hypertension, acute bronchitis, and asthma by multivariate ANCOVA analysis. Due to expected sexspecific differences, all analysis were conducted for both sex. To account for age dependency of ''heart insufficiency'' and ''hypertension'', we used age-standardized prevalence. The independent variables ''district area affected by noise C55db(A)'', ''proportion of people aged 65?'', and ''physician density'' were considered continuous and scaled by units as per 5 % increase in district area and per unit step of social burden (three groups: low, average, high social burden).",

If there is no specific abnormality, no data is recorded for normal status. Therefore, observed dataset of every school are sparse. It was concluded that the proposed Archetypes have enough structure to preserve real data except for iterative free-text of specific items. The development of personal medicine approaches is one of the major challenges of modern medicine. So far, research has focused on developing the most effective treatment for entire populations. However, the most effective treatment might be different for different subgroups of patients. Recent developments in modern laboratory medicine (like advances in genomics and proteomics) have lead to the discovery of new biomarkers determining subgroups of patients benefitting from a specific treatment. The impact of genomic variability on treatment response is often assessed in a biomarker-based design. Currently, such studies are restricted in the sense that only patients for whom the biomarker can be measured can be enrolled. Patients who unable to provide adequate biosamples are thus excluded from the trial and in some cases the proportion of such patients can be substantial. A recent study in non-small lung cancer showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) could not be measured in about 30 % of the patients [1] . Hence, results from trials including only patients whose biomarker can be assessed only provide evidence on how to treat these patients.",

IgG glycosylation patterns affect the Fc binding receptors which, being activated, prompt the immune response. To analyze the genetic influence on glycosylation in IgG, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on LC-MS measured glycans on plasma of about 1600 individuals in the KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) study cohort. Additionally, we performed GWAS on ratios of glycans within IgG subclasses in order to elucidate genetic factors determining single steps in the glycosylation pathways. We replicated the results from all GWAS in the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS) of about 1842 individuals. The results indicate that in addition to genes encoding for enzymes known to contribute to IgG glycosylation (ST6GAL1 (chr.3), B4GALT1 (chr.9), FUT8 (chr.14), MGAT3 (chr.22)), other gene coding areas have a strong influence on the IgG glycosylation patterns. Interestingly, associations were found with SNPs on chromosome 7 in the region of IKZF1, a gene encoding for a DNA-binding transcriptionfactor. This is of particular interest as its non-binding isoforms are suggested to alter the progression of B-cell malignancies in humans. In order to facilitate and increase the usability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for healthcare professional's daily work, we have designed a system that enables functional and flexible EHR access, based on the execution of clinical workflows and the composition of Semantic Web Services (SWS). The backbone of this system is based on an ontology. In this paper we present the strategy that we have followed for its design, and an overview of the resulting model. The designed ontology enables to model patient-centred clinical EHR workflows, the involved sequence of tasks and its associated functionality and managed clinical data. This semantic model constitutes also the main pillar for enabling dynamic service selection in our system. The extracted information can be viewed as a set of links between variables. In the first example above, variables are ''high young adult BMI'' and ''premenopausal ER ? cancer''. In the second case, variables are ''breast cancer'' and ''low-level (\\21 g/d) alcohol drinkers''. In order for Medical Recap to be able to aggregate such links into a dependence graph or a Bayesian network, it needs to group the extracted variables (terms) semantically into concepts, as some terms may refer to similar or related things. For example, terms ''premenopausal ER ? cancer'' and ''breast cancer'' may be grouped under concept Breast Cancer.",

However, these reports may be biased due to poor recall of previous events and may lead to invalid prevalence estimates, thereby producing misleading results. Quantifying the magnitude of bias regarding reports on past diagnoses requires a precise knowledge of what has been communicated previously.

Methods Data from 2063 individuals aged 30 to 90 years at baseline were analyzed of whom 1193 (57.8 %) underwent whole-body MRI. MRI was performed using a 1.5-Tesla system. Findings of potential clinical relevance were communicated to participants using standardized letters via postal mail. A postal survey was conducted on average 2.47 years after the MRI examination among all SHIP participants which included questions about disclosed medical findings. Self-reported data were compared with existing study documents regarding communicated findings using standard measures of diagnostic accuracy.",

The project EQUAL within the BMBF funded prevention research network AEQUIPA refers to the question on how social inequalities can be considered in the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to promote physical activity among older adults. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of interventions on social inequalities in physical activity among older adults and to identify appropriate methodological approaches for equity impact assessment using systematic review methods. Methods Nine electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CEN-TRAL, Physical Education Index, Social Science Citation Index, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, IBSS) were searched using keywords related to ''physical activity'', ''interventions'', ''intervention effects'', and ''older adults''. Searches were limited to peer-reviewed journal articles published from July 2005 to July 2015, written in English or German. Studies were included if they reported the effects of interventions on physical activity behavior among adults aged 50 years and over. Interventions targeting particular social groups or persons with certain diseases or risk factors were excluded. A review protocol was drafted adhering to the PRISMA-P 2015 statement and published in Systematic Reviews [3] . The final review will be reported following the equity extension of the PRISMA statement (PRISMA-E 2012). Results Searches identified 7,704 articles. Fifty-nine studies were included, representing a diverse range of study designs, intervention strategies, and outcome measures. In addition to age and gender, the majority of studies collected at least one other social factor (e.g., ethnicity, education, area deprivation), with these most commonly reported in the description of the study population. Around half of the studies considered social factors as covariables in multivariate analyses. Eleven studies had at least an indication of having analyzed potential effects on inequalities. Intervention effects were most often compared by age and gender subgroups. Differences in intervention effects according to marital status, ethnicity, and educational level were considered less frequently. The methods used for measuring equity impacts and their quality varied by study design. Several trends for the presence of equity impacts could be derived from the analyses. With regard to gender inequalities, the results of three studies pointed to gender-specific intervention effects.",

Disease risk prediction is highly important for early intervention and treatment, and identification of predictive risk factors is the key point to achieve accurate prediction. In addition to original independent features in a dataset, some interacted features, such as comorbidities and combination therapies, may have non-additive influence on the disease outcome and can also be used in risk prediction to improve the prediction performance. However, it is usually difficult to manually identify the possible interacted risk factors due to the combination explosion of features. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to identify predictive risk factors with interactions using frequent item set mining and feature selection methods. The proposed approach was applied in the real world case study of predicting ischemic stroke and thromboembolism for atrial fibrillation patients on the Chinese atrial fibrillation registry dataset, and the results show that our approach can not only improve the prediction performance, but also identify the comorbidities and combination therapies that have potential influences on TE occurrence for AF.",

Healthcare is moving towards digitizing patients' medical information and securely exchanging it through web-based systems. In one of Ontario's health regions, Nurse Led Outreach Teams (NLOT) provide emergency mobile nursing services to help reduce unnecessary transfers from long-term care homes to emergency departments. Currently the NLOT team uses a Microsoft Access database to keep track of the health information on the residents that they serve. The Access database lacks scalability, portability, and interoperability. The objective of this study is the development of a web-based database using Oracle Application Express that is easily accessible from mobile devices. The web-based database will allow NLOT nurses to enter and access resident information anytime and from anywhere. [4] . In 2015, the British Heart Foundation commissioned a feasibility study into the establishment of a national Public Accessible Defibrillator (PAD) database for the UK and how it could improve OHCA survival. As part of this feasibility study, the views of a range of stakeholders were sought, including those of community first responders (CFRs). CFRs are volunteers from local communities who attend to emergency calls received by the ambulance service and provide care until an ambulance arrives. There were over 12,000 CFRs operating across the UK in 2014 [5] . Most of the PADs are static AEDs made available in public places. The alternative is the use of mobile defibrillators that are carried to the scene of an emergency by CFRs [6] . Methods A survey was designed with 12 questions. It covered the areas of CFR demographics, experience with PADs, and their views on a national PAD database and the technologies and apps available for locating defibrillators and for alerting lay responders of an emergency. The survey questionnaire was made available via an online survey tool (SurveyMonkey). Between November and December 2015, links to the survey were sent via email to CFRs via the National Ambulance Services Responder Managers Forum [7] . Results 760 responses were received (6.3 % response rate) with 12 out 14 ambulance service regions represented. The experience of CFRs ranges from none (just finished training) to 16 years, with the largest proportion having under 2 years experience (47.28 %, 322 of 681). Awareness of apps and their use was variable with a reasonable knowledge of GoodSAM, AED Locator and the South Central Ambulance Service app but 75 % did not know if apps are routinely used in their area. 35.47 % of respondents (255 of 719) felt a national database of AED locations would have a significant impact on awareness and use of defibrillators with a further 42.84 % (308 of 719) thinking it would have some impact. Additionally, the use of apps linked to a national database was supported by over 85 % of respondents.",

Mostly, it relies upon the patient to contact the primary care centre for necessary follow-up visits. Because of the lack of follow-up, the risk of hospital readmissions due to a new exacerbation is high. In order to break the vicious cycle of exacerbation, hospital admission, re-exacerbation and re-hospitalization we therefore reorganised the care by letting a specialised home care (SHC) clinic, supported by a telehealth system, be responsible for the care of these patients instead of discharging the patients to primary care. The study will evaluate if the re-organisation and system can contribute to earlier detection of patients' deterioration and prevention of acute hospital admission, costs, and differences between COPD and HF patients.",

Elderly, multi-morbid patients with COPD or HF exacerbations are admitted to specialised home care and tele-monitored by a multi-professional team at the SHC clinic. Patients included in the study have had at least two hospital admissions during the year preceding inclusion and planned study participation for twelve months. The patients report daily to the clinic on performed physiological measurements (e.g. saturation, weight, blood pressure), symptom assessments (breathlessness, cough, phlegm) and intake of p.r.n. (''as needed'') medication. The care providers use a web-based system, the Health Diary, to view patients' reports for the detection of early signs of deterioration. The system generates alarms if the reported measurements or symptoms are below/above the individually decided thresholds and also if a patient misses the daily report. Meeting the patients' low digital literacy we developed the telehealth system based on digital pen technology. This way the patients do not have to learn how to use a tablet/smartphone or computer; they only have to be able to write with the digital ink pen. Earlier studies have shown digital pen technology to be suitable for elderly, multi-morbid patients [1] . Exacerbations are identified using information provided through the Health Diary system and the EHR. Consumed health care is assessed as the number of patient-care provider contacts (home visits or telephone consultations by a nurse or physician).",

Under the assumption, that only subjects with uncensored baseline measurements are recruited to the trial, the problem of an upper limit of quantification is accompanied with right-censored change from baseline data in the primary analysis. In order to handle right-censored measurements, many studies simply replace these values by a single value, e.g. the upper limit of quantification or the upper limit of quantification ? x, and apply a conventional analysis for non-censored data after this step.

Current smoking and breastfeeding status and frequency were assessed via questionnaire at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-delivery. Smoking status was assessed categorically by time of first reported post-delivery smoking relapse as follows: \\6 weeks, 6 weeks to 6 months, 6 months to 2 years, or long-term abstainers (no relapse reported).

Due to the specific needs of biomedical researchers, in-house development of software is widespread. A common problem is to maintain and enhance software after the funded project has ended. Even if many tools are made open source, only a couple of projects manage to attract a user basis large enough to ensure sustainability. Reasons for this include complex installation and configuration of biomedical software as well as an ambiguous terminology of the features provided; all of which make evaluation of software laborious. Docker is a para-virtualization technology based on Linux containers that eases deployment of applications and facilitates evaluation. We investigated a suite of software developments funded by a large umbrella organization for networked medical research within the last 10 years and created Docker containers for a number of applications to support utilization and dissemination. Clinical registries are a powerful method to observe the clinical practice and natural disease history. In contrast to clinical trials, where guidelines and standardized methods exist and are mandatory, only a few initiatives have published methodological guidelines for clinical registries. The objective of this paper was to review these guidelines and systematically assess their completeness, usability and feasibility according to a SWOT analysis. The results show that each guideline has its own strengths and weaknesses. While one supports the systematic planning process, the other discusses clinical registries in great detail. However, the feasibility was mostly limited and the special requirements of clinical registries, their flexible, expandable and adaptable technological structure was not addressed consistently.",

This can be achieved by large, nationalwide EHR systems. Such an EHR however is expected to contain much more documents and health-related artefacts than conventional EMRs (Electronic Medical Records). This raises concerns of information overflow amongst the physicians and health professionals. Objectives This paper aims to introduce a new concept for the automated aggregation of a fullystructured patient summary document based on information extracted from documents which are published in large-scale EHRs. Methods In the first step, semi-structured group interviews with experts and customers were conducted. Afterwards a qualitative literature analysis was conducted. As a last step, technical and medical standards in the field of interoperability were screened. Results The result is architectural approach that integrates into workflows and processes in large eHealth projects, as shown on the example of ELGA. The integration is achieved by introducing two new services, Content Indexer and Content Index. Offering standardized IHE XDS and XDR based interfaces it is ensured, that the integration into standard based systems is possible. Capturing data in its registration process allows the extraction of information without executing automated transactions that do not involve human actors (which is always regarded suspiciously and hard to explain to the patient).",

Poor usability of Medical Devices is a cause of use-errors that may ultimately lead to patient harm or even death. The European regulation requires that threatening risks related to usability-induced useerrors are identified and controlled by the manufacturer in order to get CE marking. This imposes a usability engineering process to be integrated within the design and risk management processes. The standards harmonized to this essential requirement call for a final usability evaluation, namely ''usability validation''. However, the lack of precise definition of this ''validation'' leads to difficulties and misguided applications. The Useval-DM project aims at gathering scientific evidence regarding two main operational issues of the ''usability validation'' phase: the ecological validity of the test environments (e.g. in-lab vs. in-simulator vs. actual clinical setting) and the number of participants to validation tests. Moreover, the Useval-DM project intends to perform an economic evaluation of candidate validation protocols in order to calculate the tradeoff between their costs and effectiveness at detecting threatening usability-induced use errors. Based on its results, the project will deliver guidelines and illustrative protocols to optimize usability validation of Medical Devices compliant with the European regulation.",

Background Westernized lifestyle has been blamed for allergy epidemics, and increased distances and frequency of travelling is one of its characteristics. It has been speculated that traveling to places which substantially differ from home environment in terms of climate, vegetation and food early in life could increase the exposure to further unknown allergens and hence promote the development of allergies, but no epidemiological study has investigated this research question. Methods Detailed data on travelling during first two years as well as range of atopic outcomes along with potential confounders up to 15 years were collected prospectively within two large population-based multicentre German birth cohorts-GINIplus and LISAplus. Maximum travelling distance (within Germany; middle/northern/eastern Europe; southern Europe; outside Europe) and total number of trips were considered as exposures. Six atopic outcomes were used: (1) doctor diagnosed asthma, (2) doctor diagnosed allergic rhinitis, (3) eyes and nose symptoms, (4) sensitization to food allergens, (5) sensitization to indoor and (6) outdoor inhalant allergens. Longitudinal associations between each exposure and health outcome pair were analyzed using generalized estimation equations (GEE).",

These solutions seem effective in promoting healthcare workers self-awareness and action regarding their hand hygiene performance, which is still far from desired. Underlying these systems, an indoor positioning component (following Internet of Things paradigm) is used to collect data from the ward regarding healthcare workers' position, which will be later used to make some assumptions about the usage of alcohol-based handrub dispensers and sinks. We found that building such a system under the scope of the healthcare field is not a trivial task and it must be subject to several considerations, which are presented, analyzed and discussed in this paper. The limitations of present Internet of Things technologies are not yet ready to address the demanding field of healthcare. research. In order to alleviate the effects that aging will have on our societies in terms of increased functional deficits, waning possibilities for participation and communication and a potential risk of emergencies, supportive technical solutions are frequently proposed.

It depends on several conditions, notably previous contact with a health professional with reporting of the depressive symptoms, a correctly made depression diagnosis which was communicated to the patient and reporting of the diagnosis in the health survey interview. Information about mental health characteristics of participants with a self-reported diagnosed depression may contribute to a more accurate interpretation of survey results. In this study, the prevalence of a health professional-diagnosed depression is compared with the prevalence of DMS-IV-based major depression (MD) and their correspondence is examined across different population groups. Moreover, the prevalence of mental disorders among participants with a self-reported health professionaldiagnosed depression is reported and depression severity of individuals with a health-professional diagnosed-depression and MD, with a health-professional diagnosed-depression only and with MD only is explored. Methods Data from the cross-sectional nationwide German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) and its mental health module (DEGS1-MH) were used (n = 4483; age 18-79 years). In DEGS1, health professional-diagnosed depression in the past 12 months was assessed as a self-report of the participants in the standardized physician-administered CAPI. In DEGS1-MH, DSM-IV-based 12-month MD and further mental disorders were assessed with a modified German version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (DIA-X/M-CIDI). In both assessments, mental health severity indicators were assessed. Median time lag between DEGS1 and DEGS1-MH was 6 weeks. Weighted percentages and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated for participants with valid data in both instruments (N = 4382) using survey data procedures.",

Among participants with a health professional-diagnosed depression, 51.8 % (95 % CI 42.9-60.5) had any affective disorder, 54.7 % (95 % CI 46.0-63.1) had any anxiety disorder, 73.4 % (95 % CI 64.2-80.9) had any mental disorder; the prevalence of MD was 37.2 % (95 % CI 38.8-46.5) and was highest in those aged 18-29 years and decreased in older age groups. Among participants with MD, the prevalence of a health professional-diagnosed depression was 33.0 % (95 % CI 25.9-40.9), and it was the highest in participants aged 45-64 years and the smallest in participants aged 18-29 years. Severity measures had the highest prevalence among participants with a health professional-diagnosed depression who also fulfilled the criteria for MD. Limiting the time lag did not alter the result substantially. Conclusion Identified cases vary between a self-reported health professional-diagnosed depression and MD. A large part (73.4 %) of participants with a health professional-diagnosed depression had any 12-month mental disorder. The results indicate that among survey participants with MD, a health-professional depression diagnosis is reported most often by middle-aged and less often by younger participants. However, if a participant reports health professional-diagnosed depression, it more often corresponds with MD in younger than in older participants. The results further suggest that participants with depression identified by both instruments had higher severity levels.",

However, the generalized adoption of these normalized reports has been delayed due to several factors.

New strategies to incentivise the adoption of normalized report templates are needed to make them interoperable between distinct applications.

We previously reported the development of a system in which progress notes and case report forms (CRFs) were simultaneously recorded using a template in the EMR in order to exclude redundant data entry. To make the data collection process more efficient, we are developing a system in which the data originally stored in the EMR database can be populated within a frame in a template. We developed interface plugin modules that retrieve data from the databases of other EMR applications. A universal keyword written in a template master is converted to a local code using a data conversion table, then the objective data is retrieved from the corresponding database. The template element data, which are entered by a template, are stored in the template element database. To retrieve the data entered by other templates, the objective data is designated by the template element code with the template code, or by the concept code if it is written for the element. When the application systems in the EMR generate documents, they also generate a PDF file and a corresponding document profile XML, which includes important data, and send them to the document archive server and the data sharing saver, respectively. In the data sharing server, the data are represented by an item with an item code with a document class code and its value. By linking a concept code to an item identifier, an objective data can be retrieved by designating a concept code. We employed a flexible strategy in which a unique identifier for a hospital is initially attached to all of the data that the hospital generates. The identifier is secondarily linked with concept codes. The data that are not linked with a concept code can also be retrieved using the unique identifier of the hospital. This strategy makes it possible to reuse any of a hospital's data.

Country-specific prevalence data on common risk factors (alcohol, smoking, BMI), on associated chronic diseases and the corresponding relative risks (RR) are supplied to the user by a readyto-use database. For NRW, we aim at modelling an additional risk factor of growing concern: insufficient physical activity. Methods DYNAMO-HIA is a generic model which allows adding data on e.g. a further risk factor. Age-and gender-specific data on the risk factor prevalence, its relative mortality risk and disease-specific RRs are required. We examined 10 different data sources whether they provided the required physical activity prevalence data on country level, ideally for NRW.

A systematic literature review was hampered by the fact that physical activity is measured and reported in multiple dimensions and with different cut-offs, be that the type (e.g. occupational, recreational or leisure), the dose (frequency/duration/intensity), the scale (continuous vs. categorical) or the timing of physical activity. We focussed therefore on publications that used the physical activity levels and intensity as recommended by the WHO. Furthermore, the classification in physical activity categories had to be similar. RR-estimates were derived for use in DYNAMO-HIA by judging the published estimates, giving higher priority to data representing German or European populations and to those of relevant, large-scale studies.

The Ministry of Health Malaysia started training medical interns for proper documentation of discharge diagnosis for inpatient cases in 2011. Medical interns are often responsible to complete the clinical component of the PER-PD301 Admission and Discharge form while the medical record officers (MROs) are responsible to assign the ICD10 code. Therefore, the training aims to address the interns' competency in quality documentation which will affect the quality of the coding and resulting health information. It does not educate interns on making the correct diagnosis. The training has 3 components: (1) documentation awareness, (2) the form and definitions, and (3) problem-based exercises. Documentation awareness informs on the responsibility to complete the form and well as the consequences of its quality. They are informed on how the information flows starting from themselves to the MROs to a centralized national centre before reaching to secondary recipients; how the information represents national statistics, reused for research, and perused for health system planning. They were also shown real-life samples of poor documentation which includes ineligible handwriting, use of short forms, missing and improper information that does not define a diagnosis. Next is introduction to the form, its structure, and the definitions for each data elements required to be filled. The diagnosis section is further divided into main diagnosis (for morbidity cases) or cause of death (for mortality cases), underlying cause, comorbidity(s), complication(s), and external factor(s) in accordance to ICD10 guidelines. If filled properly and completely, this information was deemed sufficient for MROs to assign the correct coding. Lastly, the participants were given an interactive problem-based exercises consists of clinical scenarios with explicit diagnosis details. The interns are then required to fill in the form followed by an open discussion on the expected answers. The training ends with Dos and Don'ts as a take-home message. The ministry has included this training as part of the Housemanship Induction Course in 2013 conducted at the central level. Due to increasing demand and number of sessions, the training has now been decentralized to the state level. Decentralization was implemented after awareness and commitment given by hospital and state health department directors in supporting quality information.",

Positive impact on reducing medication error were associated with technical factors, including system alert, notification, and constraint; automated checking, dosing and calculation; and information completeness and accuracy; human factors, particularly user awareness and attitude; and organisational factors, namely policy, top management support, clinical processtechnology alignment and champion. However, Computerised Physician Order Entry (CPOE) has a number of limitations in guiding physician to choose the right medication and prompting excessive alerts without additional information to aid in decision making. Tedious system use, limited screen view and machine, inconvenient, nondurable and insufficient number of personal digital assistant (PDA) led to user resistance. Organisational factors such as planning, training, technology support, turnover rate, clinical workload, and communication were barriers to system implementation and use that subsequently affect medication error. A number of fit and misfit between the three factors and lesson learned were identified. Overview of HIS and technology involved in medication process, pharmacist interventions, medication error reporting system and significant medication safety issues were compared. Recommendations to improve the current medication error issues were also discussed. Continuous, systematic program of quality improvement and peer review that include mechanism for monitoring, reviewing, and reporting medication error had positive impacts on error reduction and clinical workflow. Clinical staff positively perceived the program in managing and minimizing medication error. Conclusion HIS was designed to minimize error but it also creates new risk in medication process. Error occurrence is inevitable but it can be minimized with pre-emptive endeavor. Managing medication error is crucial and benefits greatly in minimizing error and enhancing patient safety. Specific, tailored management approaches works well in a specific, contextual setting but they may also be applied to different settings. The role of socio-technical factors and their fit in realizing the potential of HIS and management approaches in minimizing error requires continuous, in-depth evaluation. Evaluation could provide the understanding for managing error incidents as a learning process in continuous process improvement. Background As with many other chronic diseases, the approach currently used to explain the etiology of suboptimal bone strength is built on the premise that there is important tracking throughout the life course, modulated by gene-environment interactions. Anthropometrics comprises a set of partially modifiable bone strength influences with great importance during childhood. Strong cross-sectional relations between body size and bone have been clearly established in paediatric populations. However it is unknown whether the identification of distinctive growth trajectories, capturing different shapes of overall growth, improves the statistical prediction of bone properties in addition to cross-sectional data. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of growth trajectories on bone physical properties at 7 years (y) of age.",

Differences between actual and agestandardized SAM were particularly striking in men. While the agestandardized SAM in men decreased nearly by half, it remained more or less stable in women.

Potential avenues to curb the smoking-associated disease burden are discussed. Conclusion Especially in men, age-standardized SAM declined much sharper than the actual SAM, meaning that the decreases of SAM in men were largely compensated by demographic ageing.

Some examples may include functional requirements, specifications, standards, clinical models and term lists, guidance on how standards may be used concurrently, implementation guides, educational resources, and other resources. Unfortunately, these are largely accessible in ad hoc ways and result in scattered fragments of a solution space that urgently need to be brought together.

            "text": "A synthesis of the published results leads to a new explanation. The key to this hypothesis is the assumption that workers, who switch from surface job to underground job are very likely in much better physical conditions than other surface workers. Therefore, this special form of a healthy-worker-effect could explain the apparent self-contradictory results of the DEMS cohort. A modified analysis by unconditional logistic regression yields a crude OR = 1.03 (95 % CI 0.74-1.43) for miners ever worked underground jobs. After adjustment for smoking the risk estimator decreases to OR = 0.92 (95 % CI 0.66-1.30). Hence, the results of the different approaches for the DEMS cohort are compatible with each other. Moreover, now they are also in line with the findings in the German potash miner cohort (5). Conclusion Nevertheless, although a reanalysis of the DEMS based on the full data set is necessary to finally confirm the results of the approximate approach described, the evidence for a dose-response relationship between diesel motor exhaust and lung cancer in humans seems to be much less than assumed by the IARC. During the development of a new medicinal drug, identifying the optimal dose is a key goal and its importance cannot be stressed enough. Selecting a too high dose might result in an increased risk of adverse events or other safety concerns, which can be avoided by using a lower dose. Selecting a too low dose might result in insufficient efficacy of the drug.",

Bretz et al. (2005) combined multiple comparison techniques and model-based approaches by introducing the MCP-Mod procedure, which marked an important methodological milestone in the advancement of dose-response analyses. Hence, the MCP-Mod approach was recently qualified as an efficient statistical methodology for model-based design and analysis of Phase II dose finding studies by the CHMP. The MCP-Mod procedure allows the specification of several candidate dose-response models. Each of these models is used to test for a dose-response signal using multiple comparison techniques while preserving the overall type I error. The most appropriate model to describe the doseresponse relationship is then selected or several models are used to estimate a dose-response relationship by averaging the results from the models with a significant dose-response signal.",

From a practical perspective, this talk also covers prior discussions with clinicians, lessons learned, and computational challenges using SAS and R. The increased dissemination of powerful mobile computing devices with access to a variety of wireless communication channels has benefited on-line capture of medical research data many areas. Yet, there is still a need for off-line capture, especially, when the availability of on-line connectivity cannot be established in advance. The clinical study ''BreathEase'' presents such a case, because it calls for extensive interviews conducted at the patient's home by visiting study staff. On the other, patient data also needed to be collected in an outpatient clinic. Furthermore, these activities needed to be co-ordinated according to protocol guidelines via a stationary system. Hence, the interview questionnaire data captured off-line needed to be merged with a stationary central database. For this purpose, an existing electronic data capture system (DBFORM) was configured to include some clinical trial management features and complemented with a module to synchronize data in the mobile and stationary databases. This paper describes the requirements, the procedure, and its implementation. While it is shown that off-line capture followed by on-line synchronization is feasible, certain ambiguities may arise that should be addressed by technical and/or other means. ",

Conclusion By way of example, Sweden as well as Japan, has been enhanced medical insurance system of the country, the database infrastructure in the government-led has been developed. Coverage of receipts database is 100 %, electronic medical records (Electronic Medical Record, EMR) has also become close to 100 %. There is a national ID number system, EMR, receipts, multiple databases, such as a patient registry has been linked with a high degree of accuracy. However, the backwardness in conduction of Electronic Medical Record database in Japan was obvious. In Japan, there are still several obstacles for the dissemination of public health and medical information, such as the problem of the protection of personal information of patients. There will be a long way to go to construct the National Electronic Medical Record database in Japan. Lack of coherent policies and standard ''good practices'' for secondary use of medical data impedes efforts to strengthen the Japan health care system. The nation requires a framework for the secondary use of medical data with a robust infrastructure of policies, standards, and best practices. Such a framework can guide and facilitate widespread collection, storage, aggregation, linkage, and transmission of medical data. The framework will provide appropriate protections for legitimate secondary use.",

The MMWIN allows for the backup of medical information from hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and various types of care facilities. By the end of March 2016, over 3 million registered patients and more than 90 million pieces of backed up data will be recorded in it. Doctors registered on the MMWIN can share the medical information of patients who agree to use it. We are recruiting 1,000 patients with varying levels of risk of heart or kidney disease or stroke between November 2015 and June 2016. The risk is being determined by cardiologists, nephrologists, and specialists in cerebrovascular disorders at Tohoku University Hospital according to standardized guidelines. High-risk patients will be recommended to visit a specialist in the area; in contrast, low-or moderate-risk patients will be randomly allocated to either an intervention or an observation group. In the intervention group, specialists will check patients' data and give advice on patient care to their physicians. The final decision on the course of therapy will be made by the physicians. Both groups will be observed and their status checked every six months. If a patient's risk becomes aggravated over the trial's course, he or she will be recommended to visit a specialist. The main outcome measures are the occurrence of heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, kidney diseases, stroke, death, and other medical events. We will also check changes in examination results and physicians' attitude towards patients. This study was approved by the human research committee of Tohoku University School of Medicine, and has been registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000018552). Written informed consent will be provided by all patients before their enrolment. Results: Seven hundred and twenty five patients have enrolled as of March 7, 2016. The intervention is being performed according to the protocol. Conclusion: A prospective randomized trial using this medical network system in a prefecture of Japan has begun clarifying the effect of telemedicine-based collaborative care between specialists in university hospitals and physicians in rural areas on patients' prognosis. Background Cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease are the three major leading causes of death in Korea. The mortality of heart disease has been gradually increasing but Cerebrovascular disease has been decreasing. However, these reports are based on descriptive chronological prevalence and mortality at the national level, but not on the inferential analytic approach [1] [2] . Therefore, those known trends are lack of information to infer inflection point from the report over time and grasp the generation pattern. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze prevalence/mortality trend and to find grounds to support the disease prevention using joinpoint analysis. Methods Prevalence data were obtained from the First to Sixth(including the second year of investigation) Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANESI-VI; 1998 -2015 . Mortality data were obtained from the Korean Statistics Information Service database of Death in Korea for 1983-2014. Age-adjusted prevalence/mortality rates were calculated by the direct standardization method using and the age-distribution for the 2010 census as standard population. Rates were presented per 100,000 population.",

Complex samples procedures were used due to the clustered sampling design and interactions of p-SRH and c-SRH with child-sex were tested. Results At baseline p-SRH was very good/good in 94.4 % and c-SRH in 85.6 %. Dichotomized p-SRH (very good/good vs. fair/poor/very poor) had changed at follow-up for 8.9 % of children (4.1 % improved and 4.8 % deteriorated) while c-SRH had changed for 19.0 % (10.0 % improved and 9.0 % deteriorated). Fair/poor/very poor p-SRH for children aged 0-13 years at baseline was predictive for incident health-related functional difficulties (OR 3.51, 95 % CI 2.31-5.34), incident chronic disease (girls OR 3.13, 1.96-5.00; boys OR 1.56, 1.05-2.34) and multiple consultations (OR 1.84, 1.20-2.83) (adjusted for age, sex and social status class). Similarly, C-SRH for adolescents aged 11-17 years at baseline was predictive for incident chronic disease (OR 2.06, 1.41-3.00) and for multiple consultations in girls (OR 2.60, 1.57-4.30) but was not predictive for multiple consultations in boys aged 11-17 at baseline and not predictive for functional difficulties (data available only for children 11-13 years). Conclusion P-SRH for children aged 0-13 years predicts incident health outcomes and health service utilization six years later and can thus be a valuable prospective single-item health indicator. C-SRH, which has been shown to be conceptually different from SRH of adults, has also predictive power for health outcomes, but more limited and with differences between boys and girls.",

Objectives Investigating (1) food consumption of 235 random households using the food consumption Score (FCS), (2) the association between socioeconomic and demographic determinants of household food access and food consumption score and (3) the association between these determinants and food access on food consumption score. Methods During a baseline survey conducted in 2013, 235 households were randomly selected in 6 districts of rural, peri-urban and urban Unguja, Zanzibar. Determinants for food access were assessed on household level as well as food consumption using validated instrument (FCS; [1] ). Economic determinants of the household were proxied by number of income sources, occupation and education of the head of household, number of assets and ownership of any type of vehicle. Proxy measures for food access of household were among others home gardening, animal rearing, food purchases, distance to market. Two separate multi-level logistic regression models were created using GLIMMIX procedure in SAS version 9.3 to investigate the determinants on food access and food consumption score.",

The present study investigated whether exposure to naturally occurring low levels of lithium in drinking water was associated with a reduced risk of suicide in Denmark considering-for the first time-individual level data and long-term exposure.",

Information on suicides was obtained from the nationwide Danish Register of Cause of Death. The use of prospectively collected individual level data enabled complete follow-up over the course of 23 years. Data on lithium concentrations were obtained through a nationwide drinking water campaign from 2013 including 151 measurements from waterworks supplying approximately 42 % of all residents in Denmark. Spatial statistics were applied to investigate geographical patterns in lithium levels. The lithium measurements were interpolated using point kriging and an accumulated lithium exposure was computed for each individual based on municipality of residence every year. The association between accumulated lithium exposure and suicide rate was analyzed using Poisson regression analysis. Clustering in the residuals was further evaluated through spatial regression analysis. Results Significant regional clustering in drinking water lithium levels were found with high levels in Eastern and low levels in Western Denmark. Suicide rates on municipality level were also found to cluster. The Poisson regression analyses showed a significant dose-response trend of decreasing suicide rates with increasing accumulated lithium exposure. The trend remained the same after adjustment for gender, age group, socioeconomic status, civil status, and calendar year.",

While numerous approaches have been utilized it is evident from cross-country comparisons that there are different conceptualizations of: both the expected and desired roles for citizens in the management of their own health; the benefits that will be delivered by citizen access and how these benefits should be measured and benchmarked over-time. This paper presents comparative analyses of the methods by which citizens are provided with access to their own health data across 11 countries.

Well-known bad practice is neither to define proper concept descriptions for the individual codes leaving their interpretation to the developer nor to identify the underlying vocabulary domain resulting in a mixture of something.

CAC progression was classified as within the band (expected), above band (rapid), and below band (slow) as described in 2. To evaluate the effect of 55 SNPs associated with CAD, a PRS for each individual was constructed by adding up the number of risk alleles (0/1/2) of each SNP and weighing by the natural log of the reported odds ratio for CAD. Generalized linear regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) (95 % confidence interval) and explored the impact of the PRS on the outcome ''rapid vs. expected/slow CAC progression''.

In the crude model the weighted CAD PRS was associated with rapid CAC progression (Relative Risk (RR) (95 % confidence interval) per SD: 1.12 (1.03;1.22), p = 0.009). Similar effect was observed in the models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors (1.10 (0.99;1.21) , p = 0.06).

The increasing demand for home care due to the growing number of older people with an increased incidence of multiple chronic conditions requires the adoption of technological innovation that can improve the integration and coordination of health and social services. This paper presents the H@H infrastructure that aims to improve the coordination and cooperation among stakeholders facilitating the provision of care services in a continuity of care framework.

The main results, based on 30 reviewed papers, were that brain and nervous system cancer, breast cancer and thyroid cancer have the shortest time to occurrence as secondary malignant neoplasms after radiotherapy for first malignant neoplasms and a minimum length of follow-up of 20-25 years should be planned for, based on the patient numbers in the reviewed studies.",

HSR is in need of high quality routine care data for its evaluations. However, the secondary use of routine data-such as documented cancer cases in a disease registry-poses new challenges in terms of data quality, IT-management, documentation processes and data privacy. In the clinical cancer registry Heilbronn-Franken, real-world data from the Giessen Tumor Documentation System (GTDS) was utilized for analyses of patients' disease processes and guideline adherence in follow-up care. A process was developed to map disease state definitions to fields of the GTDS database and extract patients' disease progress information. Thus, the disease process of sub-cohorts could be compared to each other, e.g., comparison of disease free survival of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) -positive and -negative women who were treated with Trastuzumab, a targeted therapy applied in breast cancer. In principle, such comparisons are feasible and of great value for HSR as they depict a routine care setting of a diverse patient cohort. Yet, local documentation practice, missing flow of information from external health care providers or small sub-cohorts impede the analyses of clinical cancer registries data bases and usage for HSR.

Data de-identification is an important protection method, where attributes in a dataset are transformed to meet formal privacy requirements which are specified in terms of mathematical or statistical models. A method which has been recommended for transforming health data is generalization, which means that userdefined hierarchies are utilized to iteratively reduce the precision of attribute values and thereby decrease privacy risks. With this model, the space of potentially privacy-preserving data transformations is defined by the set of all possible combinations of generalization levels of each attribute. Each such combination is called a de-identification policy. To balance privacy with data quality, data de-identification algorithms need to manage information about a potentially large number of such policies. For high-dimensional data this can result in significant memory requirements. In this article, we present a spaceefficient encoding scheme for data de-identification policies. Our results show that our method reduces memory consumption by up to a factor of 25 when de-identifying high-dimensional data. A typical example are longitudinal datasets which are collected in research S156",

De-identification means to transform a dataset in such a way that it becomes extremely difficult for an attacker to link its records to identified individuals. This can be achieved with different types of data transformations. As transformation impacts the information content of a dataset, it is important to balance an increase in privacy with a decrease in data quality. To this end, models for measuring both aspects are needed. Non-Uniform Entropy is a model for data quality which is frequently recommended for de-identifying health data. In this work we show that it cannot be used in a meaningful way for measuring the quality of data which has been transformed with several important types of data transformation. We introduce a generic variant, which overcomes this limitation. We performed experiments with real-world datasets, which show that our method provides a unified framework in which the quality of differently transformed data can be compared to find a good or even optimal solution to a given data de-identification problem. We have implemented our method into ARX, an open source anonymization tool for biomedical data.",

According to previous studies, biomedical ontologies are rich in natural language content, but most of them are not so rich in axiomatic terms. Here, we are interested in studying the relation between content in natural language and content in axiomatic form. The analysis of the labels of the classes permits to identify lexical regularities (LRs), which are sets of words that are shared by labels of different classes. Our assumption is that the classes exhibiting an LR should be logically related through axioms, which is used to propose an algorithm to detect missing relations in the ontology.

The intention of this workshop, organised by the EFMI Human and Organisational Factors (HOFMI) Working Group and Assessment of Health Information Systems (EVAL) Working Group, is to demonstrate that it does not need to be, and should not be, a choice between these two distinct approaches. The organisers will provide examples from their own work where they have sought to bridge this divide through the use of mixed methods evaluations. The goal is to encourage researchers to engage in mixed methods evaluations by presenting a range of possible designs. Background Peak oxygen uptake is a specific measure for global cardio-respiratory fitness and is determined by incremental exercise tests. The application ranges from assessment of operability in patients with heart failure to evaluation of endurance exercise in healthy individuals. Therefore, peak oxygen uptake values reveal a wide range and depend on a number of factors. The goal of the present analysis was to find sex and age adjusted reference values for peak oxygen uptake and to consider further confounding factors. Methods 10,189 individuals (3,677 females and 6,512 males) were recorded during primary preventive examinations at three locations (Ruedesheim, Frankfurt and Munich). Absolute and relative peak oxygen uptake, maximum work rate as well as anthropometric, demographic and further characteristics were measured. The associations of peak oxygen uptake and possible confounding factors were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's correlation coefficient as appropriate. Based on the results, regression modelling was performed using absolute and relative peak oxygen uptake as well as maximum work rate as continuous dependent variables. Quantile regression analysis and non-parametric spline regression models were applied. Based on the estimated goodness of fit and the practical applicability, the best approach was selected. The analysis was performed stratified for sex and adjusted for age.",

The population-based German National Cohort study (GNC) [1] collects data and biological samples of a random population sample of 200,000 study participants. Most of the biological substances (blood, urine, saliva, nasal swabs and stool) are stored in biorepositories. For each participant one sample of EDTA-blood and serum are used immediately for laboratory analysis.

Smartphones are easy to carry into bed and offer multiple facilities, e.g. calling, social networking, texting, gaming, internet, which may disrupt sleep initiation and maintenance. We aim to comprehensively describe cell phone activity during the nightly sleep span and evaluate how it relates to physical and mental health symptoms.",

However, vitamin D deficiency (\\20 ng/ml) is widespread in industrialized nations. Currently, vitamin D status of pregnant women living in Switzerland is unknown, although vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy may impact glucose tolerance and increase the risk of preeclampsia. Therefore, we evaluated vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women and determined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Due to the stronger pigmentation of the skin, women with dark skin color are more likely to have lower vitamin D concentrations than women with lighter skin color. Hence, we also addressed whether the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency differs between women with lighter or darker skin color. Methods 205 women attending the ''Geburtshilfliche Poliklinik'' at the University Hospital Zurich were recruited for blood sampling between September 2014 and December 2015. Blood was collected at the first regular pregnancy visit. A woman's skin type was self-reported based on the Fitzpatrick Scale (5-point scale), which assesses appearance and reaction to sun exposure. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations were measured using chemoluminescence immunoassay; concentrations\\20 ng/mL (\\50 nmol/L) were defined as vitamin D deficient. Covariates were assessed from hospital records and a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of being vitamin-D deficient depending on skin color. Results 129 women (63.2 %) had serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations below 20 ng/mL. Comparing prevalence by skin type, 55 % of women with light skin type (Fitzpatrick I, II and III; n = 152) and 83 % of women with dark skin type (Fitzpatrick IV and V; n = 52) had a vitamin D deficiency. Median serum concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D in all women was 17.1 ng/ml (Q1, Q3: 9.75-22.3 ng/ml). Women with light-colored skin had a mean concentration 18.4 ng/ml (Q1, Q3: 10.8-24.0 ng/ml) 25(OH) vitamin D, whereas the concentration in women with dark-colored skin was 12.3 ng/ml (Q1, Q3: 6.55-18.6 ng/ml). After adjusting for age, plasma parathyroid hormone concentration, season of blood collection, vitamin D supplement use, body mass index, smoking status, parity, and education, women with dark-colored skin had a higher odds of being vitamin D deficient than women with light skin color (odds ratio = 2.60, 95 % confidence interval 0.98-6.84).",

However, research on migrants' health is frequently challenged by rather small and biased sub-samples.

During pregnancy SUA, which is able to pass the placenta, undergoes different changes. In early pregnancy, serum levels decrease because of the uricosuric effects from estrogens and the increase of renal blood flow. During the third trimester SUA increases considerably. SUA has been associated with blockage of endothelial growth proliferation and may therefore be associated with fetal growth. The aim of this analysis was to describe the relationship of maternal SUA and renal function and investigate it with various measures of birth weight in neonates.",

Approximately 1.2 million people die each year on the roads around the world. In 2009, in Iran more than 800,000 cases of death occurred due to accidents which more than 23,000 people killed and 270,000 people injured. The aim of the study was to investigate epidemiology transport accidents based on ICD-10 in patients referred to trauma department of academic hospitals affiliated with Mashhad University of medical sciences in northeast Iran. This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed during March 20, 2013 until March 20, 2014. The study population included all records of inpatients referring due to transport accidents (9162 cases) to three trauma specialized hospitals. This study comprised only hospitalized' patients and did not included outpatients referring to ambulatory departments. The twentieth chapter of ICD-10 is about external causes of morbidity and mortality. In the present study, based on the ICD-10, all codes of TA were categorized according to the codes blocks (V01-V99).The majority of people in transport accidents were men (75 %). Most transport accidents included motorcycle riders (39.36 %), car's occupants (26.21 %) and pedestrians (24.82 %), respectively. The highest mortality of transport accidents was related to motorcyclists (37.4 %) and pedestrians (32.2 %).The majority of victims of motorcycle (22.03 %), cars (11.61 %) and pedestrians (17.93 %) injured in collision with car, pick-up truck or van. Most accidents occurred in summer (33.2 %) and spring (26 %). The majority of accidents occurred between 6 pm to 8 pm and fewer accidents occurred in the early hours of the day. As the present study showed, motorcyclists' mortality was high and these accidents occurred more for young people, it seems lack of experience of driving in young people, unauthorized speed and tend to have high speed in driving can be causes of the accidents, so officials should consider more severe rigors in terms of issuing motorcyclists' driving licenses. It seems in countries with low income, mostly inexpensive vehicles such as motorcycles are used that has low security and cause dangerous accidents on the road. Official holidays in Iran are in summer and spring and many travels are done in these seasons because Mashhad is a holy and religious city, many passengers and tourists travel to the city so that the city population in these seasons becomes three times of the real population of the city, it seems these factors are causes of more accidents in these seasons. Policy makers should consider more at groups at high risk such as pedestrians and motorcyclist. Background and objective Hypertension is globally identified as the leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality. An effective blood pressure (BP) control reduces the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure. However, international data suggest that more than a third of treated hypertensives are uncontrolled.

Statistical methodology has seen substantial development in recent times. Unfortunately, many of recent methodological developments are ignored in practice. Consequently, design and analysis of observational studies often exhibit serious weaknesses. The lack of guidance on vital practical issues discourages many applied researchers from using more sophisticated and possibly more appropriate methods when analyzing observational studies. Furthermore, many analyses are conducted by researchers with a relatively weak statistical background and limited experience in using statistical methodology and software. Consequently, analyses reported in the medical literature are often flawed, casting doubt on their results and conclusions. An efficient way to help researchers to keep up with recent methodological developments is to develop guidance documents that are spread to the research community at large. These observations led to the initiation of the international initiative for strengthening analytical thinking for observational studies (STRATOS), a large collaboration of experts in many different areas of biostatistical research. The overarching objective of STRATOS is to provide accessible and accurate guidance in the design and analysis of observational studies. The guidance is intended for applied statisticians and other data analysts with varying levels of statistical education, experience and interests (Sauerbrei et al., Statistics in Medicine 2014, 5413-5432) . The initiative involves more than 80 members from 15 countries (http://www.stratos-initiative.org/), who work in nine topic groups (TGs), focusing on such general issues as missing data, measurement error, survival analysis, and causal inference.",

Problems with data integrity may be much worse, as much time may get lost until the problem is discovered, reported and fixed [4, 5] . This oral presentation aims to give an overview about Consequences of IT-Blackouts in the Area of Fully Digital Documentation.",

The objective of this work was to determine the time dedicated to different activities including those related to electronic documentation after the implementation of a renewed nurse chart in an Electronic Health Record at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. An observational, cross sectional and work sampling study was performed. During the study 2396 observations were made in 3 wards. Nurses' activities included 36.09 % of direct care, 28.9 % of indirect care, 0.67 % support tasks, 22.99 % non related to patient tasks, 11.32 % personal activities and documenting on EHR 17.43 %. The comparison with the previous study shows indirect care activities decreased 12.28 % and non-related to patients increased 11.85 %.

The challenges arise from infectious diseases and antimicrobial/antibiotic resistance but also from a vastly increasing burden of non-communicable and age-related health conditions. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework was first introduced the early 1990s with the aim to permit a first global comprehensive and comparable evaluation of population health [1] . With the new update of the GBD, experts at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle have refined the methodology to permit burden of disease analyses that are comparable over time. Increasingly individual countries have not only joined the GBD network, but also initiated national burden of disease studies adapted to the specific Public Health challenges in their countries [2] [3] [4] . So far, Germany has only participated with single experts or provided national health survey data [5] . The international workshop ''From Global Burden of Disease Studies to National Burden of Disease Surveillance'' aimed to enhance the cooperation in public health research and exchange of information between GBD researchers and public and environmental health institutes in Germany.",

For R packages that fit regression models, we looked into types of regression models, whether the package includes criteria for the significance of a non-linear effect and whether there are graphical tools to visualize spline estimates. In this presentation we will present our first findings. We will show what are the most used packages, what are their interdependencies and their basic features.

However, to efficiently monitor data over the course of a study with a wide scope of examinations, multiple examination centers and thousands of study variables requires versatile IT tools that meet changing demands regarding content, structure and layout of quality reports. Therefore we developed a web-based data quality monitoring tool in the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), a large population based epidemiologic study. Methods Square 2 was designed as a Java EE web-application. It is built upon freely available libraries such as Java Server Faces (myfaces, bootsfaces), Rserve and Rengine for the direct usage of an R-Server by Java. Additionally, we used unit testing libraries (junit) and selfdeveloped libraries for data persistence (ShipDBM) and encryption (pwencrypt). Square 2 is deployed in Tomcat 8. All data are stored in a PostgreSQL-database (9.5). R was selected as the statistics interface because of its wide and growing scope of packages and because it is open source software. Square 2 allows for a direct PostgreSQL access by R and results of statistical analyses are administrated in the database. Square 2 reports are presently generated in PDF files (built using LaTeX) and will be available in a web format in a future release.

So, there are just some theoretical hypotheses and a set of measurements. Case-Based Reasoning is used to explain those cases that do not fit the model.

Our investigation was limited to healthy women premenopausal at blood collection, as AMH is undetectable after menopause. We identified 329 endometrial cancer cases and 339 matched controls. Concentrations of AMH were measured centrally using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ansh Labs, Webster, TX). Ten multiply-imputed datasets were created to impute the missing values of the following potential confounders: body mass index (BMI; 21 % missing), ever use of oral contraceptives (23 % missing), total number of pregnancies (27 % missing), and smoking status (4 % missing). These variables were included in the imputation models in addition to age at blood draw, year of blood draw, cohort, current oral contraceptive use, race, and education to estimate the imputed value based on the distribution within each cohort. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals [CI] across tertiles of AMH concentrations, defined among the control population in each cohort, and for doubling of AMH concentrations (OR log2 ). OR estimates were calculated in each of the multiply-imputed datasets and pooled using Rubin's rule. The associations between AMH levels and endometrial cancer risk were evaluated using both unadjusted models and multivariable models adjusted for age at blood draw, BMI, ever use of oral contraceptives (no, yes), total number of pregnancies (0, 1, 2, 3, C4), and smoking status (never, past, current). Results AMH was not significantly associated with risk of endometrial cancer overall Background Access to modern health services and medication is a key factor in the prevention of child deaths. Because individuals are charged user fees at the point of use, utilization of health services is often linked with high and partly unexpected costs for the average household in disadvantaged populations. This expense often hampers access to modern health services, especially for young children. Micro health insurance schemes have been implemented across developing countries as a means of facilitating access to modern medical care, with the ultimate aim of improving health.

A second explanation is the reduction of out-of-pocket expenditure on health, which means that this money can be spent for other health-related goods such as food, housing, or clothes. Despite adjustment for the most important determinants of CBHI enrolment, some residual confounding cannot be excluded due to the self-selection of individuals into the CBHI scheme and due to the low recruitment rate.

The prevalence of antidepressant off-label use decreased from 58 % in 2004 to 41 % in 2011. During the same time period, the prevalence of neuroleptic off-label use varied between 52 % and 71 %. Adverse drug events like cardio-and cerebrovascular events, suicidality, death, and extrapyramidal events in minors with antidepressant or antipsychotic medication were rare and no significant differences were detected between on-and off-label use. In the ADHD cohort, comprising about 119,000 minors with a total time of methylphenidate use of 1.2 million person-years, only nine major cardiovascular events were observed, which did not allow for statistical analysis. However, there was no statistically significantly increased risk of non-major cardiovascular events for current methylphenidate use compared to nonuse. Conclusion By using claims data we were able to perform comprehensive analyses of antidepressant and neuroleptic drug use in children and adolescents and to study time trends over a period of eight years. The large study population enabled detailed stratifications not only by age and sex but also by on-/off-label use, drug classes, and single substances.

Data were aggregated to county level (N = 413) and supplemented by factor scores of the socio-economic pattern variables SGX and UX. Analysis of covariance was used to compare mean outcome levels (i.e. total volume and separately for GP and specialist's services) between tertiles of UX and SGX, adjusted for covariates (outflow of services, share of people aged 65?, hospital beds per 100,000 inhabitants). We evaluated the impact of region (East vs. West Germany) as a potential effect modifier on the association between UX/SGX and measures of utilization by fitting models, including interaction terms for UX/SGX-tertile and the East-West variable.",

Socio-economic and health deprivation (SGX) in contrast was found to equally impact utilization of ambulatory care, suggesting that this measure captures major parts of heterogeneity accounting for variation in service utilization.

A more detailed structure could contain a risk adjustment with respect to age, multimorbidity and treatment intensity when respective differences are relevant. Such a classification of patient types leads to a medical office type structure of the analyzed physician. Subsequently, a natural discrimination of the medical disciplines can be achieved.",

As an example, we considered a physician who cares for 14 % of his patients in the MRG type ''insulins and analogues'' and for 11.8 % patients using test strips measuring glucose appearing as ''other diagnostic agents'' in the classification. In his medical discipline general practitioners (GP) only accounts for 3.8 % in these two groups. The physician can thereby be identified as a diabetologic specialist. Regarding orthopedics we observe a patient type structure, in which 42.9 % of all patients are related to the MRG type M01A (antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids). Costs again depend mainly on the medical discipline. In oncology average costs per patient of 15.288,17 \u20ac related to the MRG group (immunosuppressive agents including all the other drugs for the patient) can be observed versus 2.515,02 \u20ac for orthopedics. Conclusion So far, the so called ''Richtgr\u00f6\u00dfen'' (cost benchmarks per patient in a view groups) were used due to German law as a measure of drug economic efficiency of physicians in the outpatient area, but includes the morbidity structure only sparsely. With beginning of 2017 the ''Richtgr\u00f6\u00dfen'' are allowed to be replaced. Beside epidemiological benefits application of the MRG concept can be utilized further for drug economic measurements. By using subgroup structure a risk adjustment can be accomplished. This has not to be precise on the patient level but at the physician level. The distance of a physician to his medical discipline measures, to which extend he is typical or not. Extreme values may be a hint for. Current Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments lack integration of sensors and actuators of other sub-domains. Creating technical and organizational integration is addressed by the BASIS project (Build Automation by a Scalable and Intelligent System), which aims to build a cross-domain home bus system. The main objective of this paper is to present an overview of design, architecture and state of realization of BASIS by describing the requirements development process, underlying hardware design and software architecture. We built a distributed system of one independent building manager with several redundantly meshed segment controllers, each controlling a bus segment with any number of bus nodes. The software system layer is divided into logical partitions representing each sub-domain. Structured data storage is possible with a special FHIR based home centered data warehouse. The system has been implemented in six apartments running under daily living conditions. BASIS integrates a broad range of sub-domains, which poses challenges to all project partners in terms of a common terminology, and project management methods, but enables development of inter-domain synergies like using the same sensor and actuator hardware for a broad range of services and use cases.",

Those women who did not respond to the invitation letter were contacted via a first reminder letter, second reminder letter or telephone interview. This analysis investigated the proportion of women participating in the study after each intervention, as well as the time period until study participation. Logistic regressions analyses were performed to investigate associations between study participation and factors such as age, nationality and study region.",

These systems allow learners to explore and experiment with EHRs in the context of medical education. However, current eduEHRs have limitations, such as a lack of dynamic interaction built-in that would mimic real-world use of these tools. To overcome this the integration of eduEHRs with software and tools such as video simulations and tutorials has considerable promise.

We illustrate this method using a data example from nutritional epidemiology. This example highlights how measurement error can bias measures of association if ignored in the analysis. We also discuss analysis options for settings where this method is not expected to perform well. Conclusion While many researchers acknowledged errors in their instruments, few fully appreciated how this error would affect their results or made any adjustments for error in their analysis. Use of methods such as regression calibration to correct for error depends on the availability of data that allows estimation of the magnitude and nature of the errors, and currently there is a great need to incorporate the collection of such data within study designs.",

We extracted any keywords that appeared more than 10 times in the finding section of the learning data. Thereafter, we calculated the positive and negative likelihood ratio for each keyword associated with IP. The IP score was defined as the multiplication of the likelihood ratio of each keyword. We calculated the IP score of each report on the verification data. The cut-off value for detecting IP reports was determined as the nearest value to points (0, 1) on the ROC curve.

The jerked beef is sold in vacuum packaging weighing 500 g each, for this work were purchased six bags of 500 g, these were divided into two different batches (each of three samples). Under sterile conditions, the meat was cut placed in Petri dishes and weighed, each specimen were made in eight subsamples each weighing 25 g, generating 48 subsamples.

The sub-samples were added to an Erlenmeyer flask with 225 ml of sterile water and were agitated for 15 min creating wash water, and another part was added to an Erlenmeyer flask with 225 ml of sterile water and was stored at room temperature by having 14 h to form a water desalting. 1 lL Aliquots of these waters were removed and sown in the midst of exhaustion sheep blood agar and incubated at 35\u00b0C for 24 h for analysis of bacterial growth and the microbial count. Using the methodology of wash water was not observed in any growth plate. for the desalting water the results were as 'follows: for first experiment in the control group values were between 5.133 9 105 and 9.56 9 108 UFC/g after irradiation values ranged from 1.7 9 105 to 2 9 106 for 2 kGy; 0 to 6 9 104 for 4 kGy and 0 to 6 kGy performing statistical analysis between the control and the doses were not statistically significant of dose 2 kGy (p = 0, 130919) there is a statistical difference in rates of 4 kGy (p = 0.040510) and 6 kGy (p = 0.047905) in experiment two control values ranging from 2.3 9 109 to 4.1 9 109 UFC/g for the dose 2 kGy, and 4 kGy 6 kGy variants respective values of 6.5 9 107 to 1.05 9 109; 1.7 9 105 to 1.76 9 105 and from 0 to 1.3 9 104, as seen in the first experiment, no statistically significant difference in dose of 2 kGy (p = 0.079057), significant differences were 4 kGy and 6 kGy (p = 0.028125; p = 0.028151, respectively). We can conclude that the dose of 2 kGy is ineffective, and doses of 4 and 6 kGy are effective in decontaminating the jerked beef because there is a statistically significant difference between control and these doses.",

Such changes were not seen in age groups newly entering the program and those at least five years above the eligible age range. Our results indicate that the MSP holds potential of reducing BC mortality in the target population. Background Bayesian networks (BNs) can provide important information in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer [1] . Through such analysis, it is possible to represent the interactions between the variables of interest and quantitatively measure the impact on a particular outcome (such as breast cancer) [2] . Objective The goal of the work described here was to correlate the findings of mammography and/or ultrasound of the breasts and other signs and symptoms with a diagnosis of breast cancer using a BN. Methods The data used in the training database and tests were obtained from the radiology service. The subjects were 164 women with a total of 170 nodes that underwent core biopsy between July 2014 and February 2015. The nodes had been imaged at least once and classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3, 4, or 5. The BN was developed with Netica software, Version 5.17 (Norsys Software, Vancouver, BC, Canada, http://www.norsys.com) and comprised the patient's profile and signs and tests related to breast cancer. The output node was outcome (malignant, benign). BN entries included family history (yes, no), nodule palpable (yes, no), BI-RADS USG category (3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5) , BI-RADS Mammography category (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), age (C50, \\50 years), and nodule size ([2, B2 cm). The knowledge needed to explain the quantitative and qualitative parts of the BN was acquired using Bayesian learning. One problem a BN proposes to solve is lack of information, which occurs in most databases, in this context, one of the most frequently used methods for Bayesian learning is the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [3] . For preparation of the BN, the database was divided into a training set (n = 85 nodes, 23 malignant) and a set of tests (n = 85 nodes, 22 malignant). Results The total sample consisted of 170 nodes belonging to 164 women aged 46.1 \u00b1 14.2 years (mean \u00b1 SD, range: 19-89 years). In general, without considering any variable, the probability a nodule was malignant nodule was 26.7 %. On testing, the sensitivity of the BN was 93.3 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 82.9-96.0), the specificity was 88.6 % (95 % CI 81. 1-96.0) , and the accuracy was 89.4 %. Conclusions We conclude that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our BN approach was similar to those obtained in related research, but we believe that the inclusion of such variables as breast density, format injuries, and history of hormone replacement therapy may improve network performance. Background Diabetic retinopathy, which causes visual impairment/ blindness, is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes [1] . It is considered the most frequent cause of blindness in adults between 20 and 60 years of age, and 45 % of those affected have diabetes mellitus [2] . Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of decision support systems in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic accuracy. Methods An exhaustive search of Medline, Embase, and Gray Literature was performed for publications between 1970 through 2015, and were included cross-sectional and cohort primary studies of diagnostic accuracy that evaluated images of individuals with diabetes (target condition) with or without diabetic retinopathy by means of decision support systems (test in evaluation). The meta-analysis was developed with Meta-Disc software, Version 1.4. Results Twelve primary studies containing 10,195 images met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The overall sensitivity was 89.4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 87.8-90.9), and the specificity was 64.8 % (95 % CI 63.8-65.8). Diabetic retinopathy was observed in 1,624 images (pretest probability-posttest prevalence difference = 15.93 %), whereas there was no evidence of diabetic retinopathy in 8,571 (84.07 %) images. In meta-analysis, 89.41 % (1,452/1,624) of cases assessed as diabetic retinopathy and 35.18 % (3,015/8,571) of cases assessed as negative with the gold standard were positive in the decision support system; the odds ratio for overall diagnosis was 55.06 38) . Heterogeneity in sensitivity (p \\ 0.001) and high inconsistency (I2 = 88.7 %) [3] were observed. The overall specificity analysis also revealed heterogeneity (p \\ 0.001) and high inconsistency (I2 = 94.5 %) [3] . Because of the heterogeneity, various subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed; however, the heterogeneity remained high. Sources of heterogeneity between studies were explored using meta-regression analysis with clinical and technological co-factors. There was no evidence that these co-factors were the cause of the heterogeneity. Therefore, in the use of decision support systems, the chance of a positive outcome in subjects with diabetic retinopathy is 55.06 times greater than the chance of a positive outcome in individuals with a normal retina on imaging. Despite the heterogeneity between studies included in our meta-analysis, the chance of the decision support system being right in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy was high.",

Using a large representative national survey, we aimed to identify empirical model-based patterns of multimorbidity from chronic non-communicable diseases, with a focus on the contribution of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), and to quantify their association with adverse health outcomes. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Portuguese Fourth National Health Survey were analyzed (n = 23,754). Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of coexistence of 11 chronic non-communicable diseases (RMDs, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, depression, myocardial infarction, cancer, osteoporosis, asthma and renal failure). Based on the OMERACT Filter 2.0, health outcomes included life impact (self-rated health, short-and long-term disability), pathophysiological manifestations (chronic pain) and resource use indicators (frequent healthcare utilization and recent outof-pocket healthcare expenses). We assessed the association between patterns and adverse health outcomes, through sex-, age-and body mass index-adjusted prevalence ratios (adjPR), with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), obtained using Poisson regression.",

Based on these results, we recommend that future researchers conduct DM experiments with larger databases and apply other tasks, methods and DM algorithms to deepen the generated knowledge.",

Despite their identification more than a century ago, NETs remain a poorly understood disease, clear causative factors have not yet been delineated and classification of the disease has faced challenges. The latest WHO classification guideline (2010) takes into account biological behavior for the GIT in order to apply risk stratification. Prognostic factors for NETs include grading, topography, morphology and sex. In general, there is paucity of epidemiological data on NETs in Germany.

Background Application of metabolomics techniques to human stool samples becomes more and more common. Usually, some time passes between sample collection and long-term storage in the freezer, allowing undesired enzymatic reactions or degradation of metabolites. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of pre-freezing storage period and temperature on the stability of metabolites in human stool samples. Methods Stool samples from six persons were collected, aliquoted and stored at two different temperatures (4\u00b0C and room temperature) over different storage periods. Cooled storage periods are 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, room temperature periods are 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h; the immediately frozen aliquot was used as reference sample. Metabolites were analyzed by means of the Metabolon platform (Metabolon Inc.). To examine the influence of different pre-freezing conditions, the nonparametric Friedman test for repeated measures and the Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons were used. We also performed a principal component analysis to visualize the associations.",

Background Breastfeeding is generally highly recommended, but recent reports have raised doubts on the evidence of the WHO recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for six months or four months to prevent obesity, obesity related disorders in adulthood, allergies and neurobehavioural disorders. Dyslexia is one of the most common neurobehavioural disorders in childhood, with prevalence rates up to 10 % depending on diagnostic criteria and region. Apart from the genetic background involving many genes, as for other complex diseases, and the familial aggregation, the etiology is not completely understood. Although the impact of breastfeeding on a broad spectrum of neurobehavioural disorders is extensively (and controversially) discussed, no single study has investigated the association between breastfeeding and reported symptoms of dyslexia later in life so far. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze the association between breastfeeding and symptoms of dyslexia prospectively using data from two large population-based birth cohorts in Germany.",

The crude incidence rate for GCTs with one histology was 75.1 (SE 1.2) and for mGCTs 19.7 (0.6). The rate of pure choriocarcinoma (n = 19 cases) (a highly aggressive GCT) was 0.4 (SE 0.1) whereas the rate of mGCTs with choriocarcinoma (n = 117 cases) was 2.3 (SE 0.2). Mixed GCT without seminoma had a higher rate than mGCT with seminoma (9. 7 [0.4] [-4.0; 0.0] ). Discussion This is one of the few in-depth population-based studies on the histology of mixed testicular germ cell tumors. The most frequent mGCT consisted of embryonal carcinoma and teratoma (teratocarcinoma), followed by seminoma and embryonal carcinoma. Although the highly aggressive tumor, choriocarcinoma, in its pure form is rare (0.4 % of all GCT), mixed GCTs contain a choriocarcinoma component in 11.6 % of cases. ",

Background Dispensing an ePrescription for medicinal products for human use by a community pharmacist in a cross-border situation regularly poses specific challenges: the univocal identification of the medicine specified in the foreign prescription, and, if this product is not authorised, not available (shortage) or substitution is required by regulation, the dispensation of a similar medicine in line with national law.

For an admission in reimbursement catalogues the proof of a benefit is central.

Occasionally, this leads to a delayed admission of innovations. Hence, the main research hypothesis of this paper is as follows: If telemedical processes are based on an already well-established diagnostic procedure, it is less likely that the digitalization of data transfer systems leads to a new medical entity that would entail RCTs.

Lifestyle changes and medical or psychological interventions developed by taking these factors into consideration may help in Dementia prevention and delaying cognitive decline. With the rapid growth of clinical data and knowledge, feature construction for clinical analysis becomes increasingly important and challenging. Given a clinical dataset with up to hundreds or thousands of columns, the traditional manual feature construction process is usually too labour intensive to generate a full spectrum of features with potential values. As a result, advanced large-scale data analysis technologies, such as feature selection for predictive modelling, cannot be fully utilized for clinical data analysis. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature construction framework for clinical data analysis, namely, Feature??. It leverages available public knowledge to understand the semantics of the clinical data, and is able to integrate external data sources to automatically construct new features based on predefined rules and clinical knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Feature?? in a typical predictive modelling use case with a public clinical dataset, and the results suggest that the proposed approach is able to fulfil typical feature construction tasks with minimal dataset specific configurations, so that more accurate In the study, the most common types of medical images used are: X-rays and ultrasounds images. The effective representation of image format LBC is proven using an image quality index type, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).",

            "text": "An approach to support collaborative ontology construction The increasing number of terms used in textbooks for information management (IM) in hospitals makes it difficult for medical informatics students to grasp IM concepts and their interrelations. Formal ontologies which comprehend and represent the essential content of textbooks can facilitate the learning process in IM education. The manual construction of such ontologies is time-consuming and thus very expensive [4] . Moreover, most domain experts lack skills in using a formal language like OWL[3] and usually have no experience with standard editing tools like Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [5, 6] . This paper presents an ontology modeling approach based on Excel2Owl, a self-developed tool which efficiently supports domain experts in collaboratively constructing ontologies from textbooks. This approach was applied to classic IM textbooks, resulting in an ontology called SNIK (Semantic Network of IM in Hospitals). Our method facilitates the collaboration between domain experts and ontologists in the development process. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables ontologists to detect modeling errors and also to evaluate and improve the quality of the resulting ontology rapidly. This approach allows us to visualize the modeled textbooks and to analyze their semantics automatically. Hence, it can be used for e-learning purposes, particularly in the field of IM in hospitals. In clinical trials, investigating the ratio of patients with each disease who are treated in a hospital is important for determining the number of patients who are allocated to hospitals. The Japanese health insurance claims data includes standardized disease and medicine data. However, the disease data has some problems in terms of reliability, because the healed diseases are sometimes not deleted or because a disease that a patient does not actually have is registered to claim the cost of the examination. On the other hand, therapeutic medicines are administered to target particular diseases. In this study, we developed a system for estimating the number of patients with each disease using the disease data and the therapeutic medicine data. We converted the ICD-10 code to a 4-grade classification code so that we could predict the diseases in the shallow layer (e.g. gastrointestinal disease) when it was difficult to predict the precise diseases in the deep layer (e.g. gastric ulcers). A table showing the disease code and the corresponding therapeutic medicine code was provided by the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (JAPIC). We calculated the disease probability score from the diseases and therapeutic medicines and recorded the predicted disease. For the system evaluation, we used the health insurance claims data from Osaka University Hospital for January 2015. A total of 58,526 diseases were predicted from the health insurance claims data of 18,393 patients. One hundred twenty patients were randomly extracted for use in a chart review that was performed by an expert physician. Two hundred twenty-four of 329 predicted diseases, were correctly predicted; 56 were reasonably predicted, and 49 were incorrectly predicted. The main disease was correctly predicted in 71 patients. In conclusion, we could estimate the number of patients with each disease using the health insurance claims data with a certain degree of accuracy.",

Apart from that, common epidemiologic variables frequently are proxies or markers and researchers can hardly ever guarantee that the intended information is reasonably well portrayed by the collected data.

This paper presents the interim results of the socio-economic analysis of SNOMED CT. The main contribution is the development of an Economic Assessment Model that can be used to assess SNOMED CT and other terminologies' socio-economic impact systematically. Such economic assessments are valuable for public authorities when deciding on future investment in clinical terminologies, because they allow customization to different contexts, and help to forecast the likelihood of a reasonable return on investment.",

We analyzed data collected in ASSESS CT through country focus groups, questionnaires and case studies.

In addition, we discussed which benefit indicators were most important to stakeholders at the 2nd ASSESS CT validation workshop, focusing on real implementation experiences.

Patient specific factors like safety, protection and well being of trial participants and their rights, integrity and confidentiality determine the category into which monitoring for that trial will be selected. When a trial has a high risk in terms of patient safety and protection, it will fall into K1 class of monitoring strategy. Other principles for risk adapted strategies are source data verification (SDV), if 100 % SDV is required in what percentage of patients and centres. The frequency and duration of visits per centre per year and the presence of central monitoring carried out to monitor remote data entry (RDE) are other factors. Centre specific factors like local infrastructure do not play a major role in determining its monitoring strategy. In centres which fall under K2 or K3 monitoring strategy, problem oriented monitoring is carried out if the necessity arises.",

Anticholinergic drugs have been shown to enhance the risk for cognitive decline in the elderly.

Women age 30 years and older will be allowed to choose one of two early detection plans. They may opt for an annual pap smear, which reflects the current offering of the statutory health insurances, or an HPV test every five years. Once one plan has been chosen, switching between plans will not be allowed. After at least six years, an evaluation of this choice model should help determine the superiority of one plan over the other. The Cancer Epidemiology working group of the German Society for Epidemiology was invited to a meeting of the G-BA in December 2015 to discuss the planned cervical cancer early detection program and to provide a written statement.

Methods A random sample of around 120.000 persons from the general population aged 40-54 years from the catchment areas of the study centers in Dresden, Munich and Stuttgart was contacted to assess FH of CRC by an online-questionnaire.

Those with a FH of CRC in FDRs are invited to the study centers for individual consultation regarding CRC prevention (targeted number 1.200) . Participants are asked to donate blood and stool samples which will be stored in a biorepository for interdisciplinary translational research within DKTK. Considering the individuals' medical history, diagnostic colonoscopy is recommended and colonoscopy records will be obtained. Prevalence of CRC and its precursors will be evaluated according to age and sex of participants and number, type and age at diagnosis of affected FDRs.

Analyzing such time series in extensive electronic medical records for research purposes may itself require customized automation, so we developed a set of algorithms for quantifying different aspects of temporal fluctuations. We implemented conventional measures of dispersion, summaries of absolute gradients between successive values, and Poincar\u00e9 plots. We aggregated the severity and duration of hypotensive episodes by calculating the average area under different mean arterial pressure (MAP) thresholds. We applied these methods to 30,452 de-identified MAP series, and analyzed the similarity between alternative indices via hierarchical clustering. To explore the potential utility of these propositional metrics, we computed their statistical association with presumed complications due to cardiovascular instability. We observed that hierarchical clustering reliably segregated features that had been designed to quantify dissimilar aspects. Summaries of temporary hypotension turned out to be significantly increased among patient subgroups with subsequent signs of a complicated recovery. These associations were even stronger for measures that were specifically geared to capturing short-term MAP variability. These observations suggest the potential capability of our proposed algorithms for quantifying heterogeneous aspects of short-term MAP fluctuations. Future research might also target a wider selection of outcomes and other attributes that may be subject to intraoperative variability.

We recommend focusing attention for further development on those tools that contain comprehensive portfolios of outbreak management functionalities and reference to established standards in disease surveillance. Purpose: An important part of the electronic information available in Hospital Information System (HIS) has the potential to be automatically exported to Electronic Data Capture (EDC) platforms for improving clinical research. This automation has the advantage of reducing manual data transcription, a time consuming and prone to errors process. However, quantitative evaluations of the process of exporting data from a HIS to an EDC system have not been reported extensively, in particular comparing with manual transcription. In this work an assessment to study the quality of an automatic export process, focused in laboratory data from a HIS is presented. Methods: Quality of the laboratory data was assessed in two types of processes: (1) in a manual process of data transcription, and (2) in the automatic process of data transference. The automatic transference was implemented as an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process. Then, a comparison was carried out between manual and automatic data collection methods. The criteria to measure data quality were correctness and completeness. Results: The manual process had a general error rate of 2.6 to 7.1 %, obtaining the lowest error rate if data fields with a not clear definition were removed from the analysis (p \\ 0.000). In the case of automatic process, the general error rate was 1.9 to 12.1 %, where lowest error rate is obtained when excluding information missing in the HIS but transcribed to the EDC from other physical sources. Conclusion: The automatic ETL process can be used to collect laboratory data for clinical research if data in the HIS as well as physical documentation not included in HIS, are identified previously and follows a standardized data collection protocol.",

The consistency between drugs prescribed to patients and their indications could solve difficulties related to the identification of ICD-10 undercoded chronic diseases as the Parkinson Disease. Our goal was to highlight patients' stays mentioning administration of antiparkinsonian drugs and not coded for Parkinson's disease. Our approach was to parameterize tables of associations between ICD-10 codes and drug identifiers in the Web100T \u00d2 application that collects medical information in our hospital and displays related inconsistencies for patients' stays. Based on acute care patients' stays of the second semester of 2015, we identified 246 patients corresponding to 253 stays, for which 33 % of stays were not coded with the ICD-10 G20 code of the Parkinson's disease. The precision of our approach was 29 %. Based on these data we predict roughly 84 patient stays without mention of Parkinson Disease.

Unreconciled data structures and formats are a common obstacle to the urgently required sharing and reuse of data within healthcare and medical research. Within the North German Tumor Bank of Colorectal Cancer, clinical and sample data, based on a harmonized data set, is collected and can be pooled by using a hospital-integrated Research Data Management System supporting biobank and study management. Adding further partners who are not using the core data set requires manual adaptations and mapping of data elements. Facing this manual intervention and focusing the reuse of heterogeneous healthcare instance data (value level) and data elements (metadata level), a metadata repository has been developed. The metadata repository is an ISO 11179-conformant server application built for annotating and mediating data elements. The implemented architecture includes the translation of metadata information about data elements into the FHIR standard using the FHIR Data Element resource with the ISO 11179 Data Element Extensions. The FHIRbased processing allows exchange of data elements with clinical and research IT systems as well as with other metadata systems.

Already in 2006 Vach & Christensen pointed out that there may be more efficient ways to randomize patients in such studies. If patients with multiple markers are randomized in anadequate manner, it is possible to use patients receiving standard treatment for several comparisons.

Conclusions Randomization and analysis strategies have a high impact on the efficiency of umbrella trials. The most crucial point is the question, whether we allow multiple treatments or not. Due to the potential impact on the necessary sample size, the design of umbrella trials should be done with great care. Many scientists perform initial data analyses (IDA) as part of their research studies. For some this may mean data cleaning, others understand IDA as basic data summaries, and yet others perform exploratory analyses, which are then formalized in statistical models.

For example, we characterize data screening as a attempt to understand those properties of the data that may affect future analysis and interpretation. It consists of two main activities: Comparing the actual distribution of variable(s) with implicit or explicit expectations, and detection of data properties which may represent a potential threat to the correct application of statistical methods or the adequate interpretation of results. Across all steps, key elements of IDA are transparency and full documentation. We hence introduce principles to achieve this goal and discuss several aspects of the organizational frame.",

However, the secondary use of the tremendous amount of stored data is generally more limited. Nowadays, medical imaging repositories have turned into rich databanks holding not only the images themselves, but also a wide range of metadata related to the medical practice. Exploring these repositories through data analysis and business intelligence techniques has the potential of increasing the efficiency and quality of the medical practice. Nevertheless, the continuous production of tremendous amounts of data makes their analysis difficult by conventional approaches. This article proposes a novel automated methodology to derive knowledge from medical imaging repositories that does not disrupt the regular medical practice. Our method is able to apply statistical analysis and business intelligence techniques directly on top of live institutional repositories. It is a Web-based solution that provides extensive dashboard capabilities, including complete charting and reporting options, combined with data mining components. Moreover, it enables the operator to set a wide multitude of query parameters and operators through the use of an intuitive graphical interface. and improving scientific data analysis.

Our analysis employs a slight modification of the multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) method proposed by Bringmann et al. (2013) . The strengths of the edge between two items in the network come from regression coefficients of VAR models. Item values at time point t ? 1 are regressed on item values at time point t for all consecutive time points on the same day. We choose Random Intercept Models to incorporate the multilevel structure of the data. The strengths of an edge can be either positive or negative, indicating a positive or negative predictive interplay. For the assessment of importance of single items, standard centrality measures were used. Betweenness measures the importance of an item for the information flow through the whole network. Outstrength represents the degree to which an item affects all other items of the network. Instrength measures how much an item is affected by other items of the network.",

The World Health Organization estimated that 80 % of the deaths caused by CVD take place in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Objective: This paper describes the development of a mobile Electrocardiogram (ECG) system designed to support the evaluation of cardiovascular risk. Methods: The system was developed using low-cost technology, implemented under the open-source platform SANA and adding an ECG signal to the process of cardiovascular risk evaluation. Results: Main functionalities of the system include a visualization and analysis of the ECG signal in the Android mobile device, calculation of four cardiovascular risk scales, standard ECG transmission using the European Data Format (EDF), and integration into an Electronic Health Record system. Ten experts recommended 28 different application scenarios for the system, and evaluated its performance (100 %) and relevance of the functionalities (89 %). Conclusions: The paper demonstrates the feasibility to develop a low-cost, open source, mobile ECG System able to support the evaluation of cardiovascular risk and potentially useful for other health promotion and prevention programs and scenarios, especially in LMIC.",

Up to an estimated 360 million European citizens are exposed to ID, which is not only due to variable iodine provision, it is also rooted in significant heterogeneity of prevention and monitoring activities, leading to inappropriate interventions, health inequalities and increased disease burden with substantial impact on health-care costs. A major concern remains the large number of pregnant women exposed to ID, which results in a measurable decrease in cognitive potential of their children. An effective European monitoring program is a crucial step towards eradication of ID disorders (IDD) with significant benefits for European citizens and the sustainability of health care systems.

CKD disposes the patient to complications during hospital stays due to CHD, such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Both, CKD and AKI represent risk factors for the progression of CKD, progression of CHD, and impaired outcomes in CHD. Therefore, reporting CKD and/or AKI in discharge letters is important to transfer information on these major events to the physician in the ambulatory setting. From the hospital's perspective, adequate ICD-coding of CKD and AKI is relevant for reimbursement. In the current study we describe the prevalence of CKD in patients admitted due to CHD.

Epidemiological challenges when assessing cancer risk in a contaminated Austrian alpine valley Waldhoer T., Mueller K., Hackl M., Hutter H-P., Heinzl H. Introduction From 1926 to 1981 contaminated waste has been deposited at a special landfill by local chemical industry in Carinthia, Austria. In 2010, it was decided to clear the site and about 100.000 tons of contaminated slaked lime were burnt between July 2012 and November 2014 in a local cement plant. In spring 2014, an unusually high environmental load of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) has been measured in milk products from this Carinthian alpine valley. In December 2014, public authorities appointed a group of experts to conduct a human biomonitoring study in order to investigate the HCB exposure of the population. At the same time media presented figures showing that the district containing this alpine valley region exhibits the highest cancer rates in Carinthia. This caused general health related concerns. Debates started if the recent exposure to HCB and/or other negative environmental factors in the past are associated with an increased cancer risk.",

Methods A sample of 1050 Bavarian residents aged 13-80 years participated in an computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) and completed three 24-h dietary recalls by telephone interview using EPIC-SOFT. Underreporters were excluded from the analysis. For the main food groups and subgroups the usual intake was calculated. We applied a weighted means approach, accounting for weekday and weekend day of consumption on the 24 h-recall data. These distributions were compared with those derived by the NCI method, which fits a twopart model for the consumption probability and the amount on consumption days. We included age, sex, BMI, smoking, physical activity and SES as adjustment variables.",

Early contact to allergens in childhood can lead to sensitisations and possibly cause asthma and other atopic diseases. So far it has not been examined, how the increase and the modification of the pollen affect sensitisations in preschool children. Beyond that, the importance of standardized repeated assessment of asthma and allergies, as well as corresponding symptoms which includes objective measurements is obvious. Methods Supported by the Bavarian State Ministry of Health, in 2004 health monitoring units (GME) were established by the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority. The aim is to routinely collect standardized health data of children. In three of these cross-sectional studies (2004/ 2005, 2006/2007 and 2012/2013 ) questionnaires included items on doctor diagnosed asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis, symptoms of these diseases (e.g. wheezing, itchy eyes, rash) as well as already performed allergy testing and thereby identified allergens. Based on these findings, a study is being conducted with the addition of objective measurement of sensitisations in Bavarian preschool children. Sensitisations are analysed in capillary blood samples of preschool children by the use of two methods for determining specific immunoglobulin E (IgE): ImmunoCAP ISAC Array and Euroline. Beyond this, the local pollen load in nearby cities is extrapolated. With these parameters an examination of the association between sensitisations in preschool children and local pollen loading is possible.",

Doctor diagnosed asthma and allergies, as well as symptoms were more frequent in boys, except for atopic eczema. In 2012/2013 out of children with at least one parent reported symptom of asthma and allergies, 44 % had previously undergone an allergy test. The most common reported allergens in medically diagnosed allergic children were: house dust mites, pollen, animals and food. In the current SEAL-study (Sensitisations and Allergies in Bavarian preschool children) these results will be compared to objective measured sensitization of the preschool children. As first results, it appears that both children with and without sensitizations are participating in the SEAL study.

It results in auditory complications such as hearing loss and tinnitus. Previous estimates of prevalence and incidence of auditory complications vary greatly and are hard to compare between studies. It thus remains unclear, how auditory complications vary between diagnostic childhood cancer groups. Platinum compounds with ototoxic properties or cochlea-sparing radiation techniques are increasingly used to treat childhood cancer. It is important to know how these developments in ototoxic cancer treatment affect the burden of auditory complications in childhood cancer survivors. Therefore, we aimed: (1) to investigate the prevalence of self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus in survivors of all diagnostic childhood cancer groups, compared to their siblings; (2) to assess the effects of cancer treatments on hearing loss, and (3) to describe the cumulative incidence of hearing loss over different time periods of cancer diagnosis.",

Existing benchmarks, however, suffered from time-consuming data management and analyses due to a lack of a coherent IT architecture. The aim of this study, therefore, was (1) to identify existing concepts and solutions for IT tools to support benchmarking and (2) to check the suitability of these solutions for this task. To this end, a systematic literature review was performed and concepts and solutions, which were identified in the literature, tested for their support of six core benchmark processes. The systematic literature review resulted in 7 studies, which partly covered the entire benchmark process. The most elaborate approaches contained a data warehouse and some related tools. Based on these findings, an overall architecture for data management and analysis of benchmarks was developed. Open source components (LimeSurvey, Pentaho, OpenRefine, MySQL, R) were implemented in an initial prototype with a data warehouse as the information hub. Data could flow bidirectional and semi-automatic. This approach demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the architecture and showed first benefits in terms of consistent data, which are less error prone.",

Many interventions have been proposed in order reduce MAEs and the amount of harm associated with these errors. A major limitation in assessing the effectiveness of these interventions has been the lack of robust measures for assessing changes in MAEs and associated harms. Drawing upon extensive foundational research we have developed a robust approach and data collection software to be applied in direct observational studies of nurses to allow measurement of changes in MAE rates. We report how this approach is being applied in a large stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an electronic medication management system to reduce MAEs in a paediatric hospital.",

The need to apply robust and sophisticated evaluation models to assess HIT interventions is recognised. Systematic reviews demonstrate an excessive reliance upon uncontrolled before and after studies and qualitative studies.[5; 6] The opportunity to conduct randomised controlled trials of HIT interventions is extremely limited. Steppedwedge cluster randomised controlled trials (SWCRCT) present a relatively new design with possibilities for application in HIT evaluation. [7] However there are significant practical challenges. Our aim was to design and execute a SWCRCT to assess the effectiveness of an electronic medication management (eMM) system at two paediatric hospitals. This paper describes the study and some of the practical challenges encountered in this process. Methods A SWCRCT will be used to measure prescribing and medication administration error (MAE) rates, potential and actual adverse drug events, and length of stay pre and post eMM system implementation. In stage 1, 8 wards within the first paediatric hospital have been randomised to receive the eMM system one week apart. In stage 2, the second paediatric hospital will randomise implementation of a modified eMM and outcomes will be assessed using a SWCRCT.",

Abstracts were included when they described a mHealth app targeted at patients and reported on the effects of this app on patient care. From a total of 559 potentially relevant articles, 17 papers were finally included. Nine studies reported a positive impact of the patient-centered mHealth app on patient care; 4 of these studies were randomized controlled trials. Measured impacts in the 17 studies focused on improving patients' physical activity, self-efficacy and medication adherence. Human factors issues potentially mediating these effects were discussed in all studies. Transitions in the interaction between healthcare providers and their patients were most often discussed as influencing the impact of the mHealth app. More research is needed, focussing on human issues mediating the effect of patient-centered mHealth apps to precipitate knowledge on the effectiveness of mHealth. This research should preferably be guided by socio-technical models.",

Each participating hospital will store their own data in a Data Warehouse (DWH) located on its own premises. The data originates directly from the emergency room (ER) protocol [2, 3] , documented in HL7 v3 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) [4] . The DWH is based on the open source clinical data warehouse I2B2 (short for: informatics for integrating biology and the bedside) [5], with custom tools to validate and import the ER-CDA documents. Methods CDA documents can be transmitted to the DWH via two standard interfaces: We implement an IHE XDS.b document repository for SOAP API calls as well as a HL7 FHIR Binary [6] endpoint for RESTful data transfers. The documents originating from the information infrastructure have to be validated. The specification is available at HL7 Germany [7, 8] . We make use of the generated Schematron definition and validate the documents against the given rules. Validation ensures only specified documents are accepted into the DWH, in this case, those compliant with the ER-CDA. We break down the complex CDA XML structure into Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) format, since the I2B2 stores data as encounter datasets, based entity-value pairs. Transformation from and to CDA documents is no novelty [9] , but in this case, we only need one direction and only from one CDA definition. Furthermore, not all parts from ER-CDA are required, e.g. a laboratory test will not be part of every encounter. Thus, not all fields as defined in the CDA are necessarily filled. As no person identifying data is needed in the DWH, fields such as names are removed from the document as a first early step of anonymization. Since a CDA document can be submitted to the DWH without being finalized, e.g. the patient is still in care, each encounter dataset in the DWH is identified via the encounter ID in the original CDA document, generated by the originating infrastructure. Thus, the dataset can be updated given the corresponding updated CDA document.",

Most of these trends, while improve the accuracy, efficiency, and convenience of healthcare services delivering, on the other hand increase the attack surface from the adversary's perspective. Taking the advantage of digitalization of medical and health records and cloud based data management applications, e.g., hospitals' and health insurance companies' own databases or services provided by cloud-based platforms such as Microsoft HealthVault, Google Health, and Dossia, an attacker can have a chance to hack into a health database [1] with full profiles of the targets. BYOD and electronic records sharing can increase the chances of data breach caused by inadvertent or malicious security and privacy policy violation [2] . The wired and wireless network connecting functionality in medical devices, e.g., a pacemaker [3] , can open a channel in an unexpected way to cyberattacks if having not considered security requirements in the technology design phase. On the other hand, the scope of entities with legal liability to security breaches can be expanded from healthcare organizations to including other involved business associates [4] under the increasing privacy concerns, which requires more stakeholders including technology solution providers in the healthcare eco-system to take efforts in ensuring the protection of the data processed and used. However, healthcare staffs' practical experiences and statistics showed that most security breaches have been attributed to socio-technical and human factors, which go far beyond the area of technology [2, 5] . Such challenges include gaps in working culture, lack of security training and awareness, negligence of security policy under emergencies or other stressful situations, lack of individualized guideline for security incident response, and lack of a quantitative way to modelling the human factors in the whole healthcare eco-system from the information security perspective. We believe we need an interdisciplinary and socio-technical approach to securing health informatics solutions. The future security and privacy designs for health informatics should fully incorporate the knowledge created from human response and behavior analysis when modelling the human factors for incident prevention, detection, response, and disaster recovery. In this workshop we plan to invite people with varied backgrounds to provide their opinions on security challenges and hopes about health informatics and exchange ideas to facilitate new ideas for implementing concept of using the socio-technical approach to securing health informatics. 463 mHealth quality: a process to seal the qualified mobile health apps Yasini M 1 , B\u00e9ranger J 2 , Desmarais P 3 , Perez L 1 , Marchand G 1 1 DMD Sant\u00e9, Paris, France; 2 KEOSYS, Scientifical, Ethical & Medical departement, Paris, France; 3 Desmarais Avocats, Paris, France A large number of mobile health applications (apps) are currently available with a variety of functionalities. The user ratings in the app stores seem not to be reliable to determine the quality of the apps. The traditional methods of evaluation are not suitable for fast paced nature of mobile technology. In this study, we propose a collaborative multidimensional scale to assess the quality of mHealth apps. During our process, the app quality is assessed in various aspects including medical reliability, legal consistency, ethical consistency, usability aspects, personal data privacy and IT security. A hypothetico-deductive approach was used in various working groups to define the audit criteria based on the various use cases that an app could provide. These criteria were then implemented into a web based self-administered questionnaires and the generation of automatic reports were considered. This method is on the one hand specific to each app because it allows to assess each health app according to its offered functionalities. On the other hand, this method is automatic, transferable to all apps and adapted to the dynamic nature of mobile technology.",

Health status measures predict mortality in general population. Short Form 36 (SF-36) was validated and is widely used in countries in Europe and North America. However, SF-36 is not validated for populations in Ethiopia. We aimed to validate SF-36 in Afan Oromo speaking general population in Ethiopia and determine predictors of self-reported physical-and mental-health.",

Sample size was based on a prevalence of 0.5 (50 %) with a 0.03 margin of error and 10 % contingency for potential non-response. All adults 18 years and older were eligible to participate. Data was collected via face-to-face interview by trained interviewers. We translated the English version of SF-36 into Afan Oromo, the official language of ONRS. Items were converted to the local context. For example, item on 'climbing stairs' was translated as 'walking up hills.' This version was then back translated into English. The translated version was seen and approved by 11 of the 14 authors giving 78.6 % agreement. We used Cronbach's a for reliability, and spearman's correlation coefficient for scale validation. Linear regression was used to analyze predictors of health status.",

Age of the participants ranged 18-86 years with mean \u00b1 SD of 35.5 \u00b1 14.2. Seven out of the eight scales of SF-36 were found to be reliable with Cronbach's a of [0.7. Vitality scale was not reliable. Physical Functioning scale showed a valid item-scale correlation except for the items 'walking one block' and 'bathing or dressing yourself.' All mental health items were item-scale valid. The mean and standard error of the physical functioning and mental health scales were 76.66 (0.76) and 72.18 (0.63), respectively. Predictors of good physical functioning were being male; higher schooling vs. no schooling; physical functioning decreased significantly with increasing age (age 18-24 (b = 29.47), age 25-34 (b = 23.68), age 35-44 (b = 20.22), age 45-54 (b = 16.50), age 55-64 (b = 14.90), p value for all age groups is \\0.0001). Being single (b = 10.88, p = 0.038) or married (b = 8.60, p = 0.016) compared to widowed/divorced; and being employed (b = 7.59, p = 0.0002) also indicated better physical functioning. Conclusion This is the first study showing that in the Ethiopian Oromia state, women, married/divorced/widowed individuals, individuals with no education/informal school only, and unemployed persons were at risk for lower physical functioning. Likewise, physical functioning decreased monotonically with age. Results point at potential for preventive interventions.",

Providing patients with access to their medical data has recently evolved as a topic in several countries. Different approaches are possible. For example patient portals are used for patient access towards medical data. The University Hospital Heidelberg is engaged in a research project to develop a personal cross-enterprise electronic health record (PEHR). The objective of this work is to describe the architecture and implementation of a component called IHE Connector which represents the native IHE-based integration between the patient portal and the PEHR core components. The architecture of the PEHR is accepted based on international standards. The core components consist out of ready to use software products like a master patient index. The patient portal has been developed using Liferay framework. The IHE Connector is mainly based on the Open eHealth Integration Platform (IPF) Framework, which has been deeply integrated into the patient portal to support the needed IHE transactions. Several IHE profiles for sharing documents and patient information are supported by the IHE Connector. As IPF already provides interfaces for some IHE profiles others had to be developed from scratch. The IHE Connector can not only be used for connectivity between patient portal and PEHR core, but also provide connectivity for third party apps and healthcare providers' information systems.",

In our previous work [1] we have offered an approach of automatically labeling potential similarities in the hierarchical structure of the terminologies based on the semantic likeness and hierarchical position of the concepts themselves. The efficiency of this approach has been demonstrated by developing a framework and implementing in an automated tool, which we called HierarchyDiff. This tool was able to detect similarities between related hierarchies of two different terminologies: Pharmaceutical biologic product hierarchy and Substance hierarchy of SNOMED CT[2] and INGREDIENT_KIND hierarchy of National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT)[3] and suggest potential ways of combining and cross-referencing the information in these hierarchies.",

Smokers often exhibit lower body mass index (BMI) and higher waist circumference (WC) compared to nonsmokers. Previous meta-analyses of genome-wide association (GWA) studies revealed many genetic loci affecting obesity traits. However, these studies have largely ignored smoking status and little is known whether genetic effects differ between smokers and non-smokers. By accounting for smoking status (SMK, current vs. not current smoking), we here aim to identify novel genetic loci and gene-smoking (GxSMK) interaction effects for (1) BMI, a measure of overall obesity",

Two traffic indicators-traffic on the nearest street and traffic load on major roads within 100 m were also investigated. Cox regression models with age as the time axis and adjustment for sex, calendar year, smoking status, intensity and duration, occupational status and area socioeconomic status were calculated.ResultsData on 104,714 individuals contributing 1,899,063 person-years at risk (average follow-up 18.1 years) were analysed. 375 incident cases of gastric cancer and 311 of UADT cancer occurred.No statistically significant associations were found for any of the exposure measures. We found elevated hazard ratios for an increase of 5 lg/m 3 of PM2.5: 1.22 (95 % CI 0.80; 1.86) for gastric cancer and 1.28 (95 % CI 0.80; 2.02) for UADT cancer. The corresponding HRs for PM10 were 1.09 (95 % CI 0.71; 1.67) and 1.01 (95 % CI 0.63; 1.61), and for NO2 0.94 (95 % CI 0.78; 1.13) and 1.04 (95 % CI 0.85; 1.28), respectively. For PM2.5absorbance, an indicator for elemental carbon, the association with UADT-cancer was 1.12 (95 % CI 0.73; 2.00) and 0.75 (95 % CI 0.47; 1.20) for gastric cancer. Adjustment for the other pollutants did only slightly influence the effect estimate for PM2.5 and gastric cancer and UADT cancer. Restriction to study participants with stable addresses over follow-up resulted in an increase of the effect estimate for UADT cancer and a decrease for gastric cancer with a decrease in precision.

Lignans (i.e. flaxseed) and isoflavones (i.e. soy) are the main sub-groups and enterolactone (ENL) and genistein (GEN) are the major biologically active metabolites, respectively. To date, there is no clear evidence concerning the effects of PEs on tumor prognostic markers for breast cancer, such as the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).AimThe aim of the study is to investigate possible associations between a high dietary intake of both lignans and isoflavones, measured as serum biomarkers (ENL, GEN), and Ki-67 expression and HER2 receptor status in tumors of patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Data of the MARIE study (Mamma Carcinoma Risk factor InvEstigation)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005), a population-based case-control study with breast cancer patients (ICD-10 C50, D05) aged 50-74 years were used. Post-diagnostic serum ENL and GEN levels were measured by using time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (TR-FIA). Ki-67 scores and HER2 status were determined in tissue-microarrays (TMA) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Patients with in situ-tumors and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Multiple linear regression models (Ki-67 continuous) and multiple logistic regression models (HER2 status) were carried out in 754 breast cancer patients with available data to assess the association with ENL and GEN (per 1 nmol L -1 increment) separately, adjusting for tumor characteristics and lifestyle factors. Possible effect modification by tumor characteristics was assessed using multiplicative interaction terms. negative tumors (b -0.084, p \\ 0.001, -0.13 to -0.04) (p het \\ 0.001) and for PR-negative tumors (b -0.062, p = 0.002, -0.10 to -0.02) (p het 0.014). Further, an association between ENL and Ki-67 was observed for HER2-positive breast cancer only (b -0.060, p = 0.010, -0.11 to -0.01) although not significantly different in HER2-negative tumors (p het 0.605). Regarding HER2receptor status, we found no evidence for an association with ENL (p value = 0.71) or GEN (p-value = 0.90) and did not observe effect heterogeneity by ER-or PR-receptor status.",

Validation in the test dataset revealed an AUC of 0.75 (95 % confidence interval 0.66-0.84). When requesting that all sepsis cases were classified as such (sensitivity of 100 %), 30 % of SIRS cases were classified correctly. If aiming at the best overall performance as defined by the Youden index, 80 % of SIRS cases and 66 % of sepsis cases could be identified.ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that, based on routinely available data, antibiotic treatment can be withheld from about one third of all pediatric SIRS patients without putting any sepsis patient at risk of not being treated.

The results of available studies which have determined predictors of EMS use are inconsistent and vary considerably depending on study type, sample size, covariables, and country of origin. No previous study has determined predictors of EMS use in patients with reinfarction taking into account characteristics of the first infarction. Moreover, it is still unknown why patients with reinfarction refrain from calling EMS, in spite of their experiences from the first infarction. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine factors associated with EMS use in a population-based sample of German patients with recurrent acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The sample consisted of 998 persons with first and recurrent acute myocardial infarction, between 1985 and 2011 from the MONICA/ KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry, Augsburg. Logistic regression modelling adjusted for sociodemographic, situational, and clinical variables, prior diseases, and presenting AMI symptoms was applied. Results EMS was used by 48.8 % of the patients at first, and 62.6 % at recurrent AMI, respectively. In first AMI, higher age (Significant predictors of EMS use in recurrent AMI in patients who failed to use EMS at first AMI were: married (OR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.33-0.92), experience of any symptom except chest symptoms at reinfarction (OR 3.60, 95 % 1.62-8.00), bundle branch block (first AMI) (OR 3.66, 95 % CI 1.30-10.32), any in-hospital complication (first AMI) (OR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.05-2.83), longer time period between first and recurrent AMI (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.09), and later year of reinfarction (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07). Conclusion EMS use in AMI is considerably low in the view of a potentially life threatening situation.

Methods A cross sectional study included all adult patients potentially at risk of a prescribing or monitoring error defined by a combination of diagnoses and prescriptions in 526 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) up to 1 April 2013. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of potentially hazardous prescriptions of anticoagulants, anti-platelets, NSAIDs, b blockers, glitazones, metformin, digoxin, antipsychotics, combined hormonal contraceptives, and oestrogens and monitoring by blood test less frequently than recommended for patients with repeated prescriptions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and loop diuretics, amiodarone, methotrexate, lithium, or warfarin. The prevalence of different types of potentially hazardous prescribing ranged from almost zero to 10.2 %, and for inadequate monitoring ranged from 10.4 to 41.9 %. Older patients and those prescribed multiple repeat medications had significantly higher risks of triggering a prescribing indicator whereas younger patients with fewer repeat prescriptions had significantly higher risk of triggering a monitoring indicator. There was high variation between practices for some indicators. Though prescribing safety indicators describe prescribing patterns that can increase the risk of harm to the patient and should generally be avoided, there will always be exceptions where the indicator is clinically justified. Furthermore there is the possibility that some information is not captured by CPRD for some practices-for example, INR results in patients receiving warfarin.ConclusionThe high prevalence for certain indicators emphasises existing prescribing risks and the need for their appropriate consideration within primary care, particularly for older patients and those taking multiple medications. The high variation between practices indicates potential for improvement through targeted practice level intervention.BackgroundThe use of Electronic Health Records databases for medical research has become mainstream. In the UK, increasing use of Primary Care Databases is largely driven by almost complete computerisation and uniform standards within the National Health Service. Electronic Health Records research often begins with the development of a list of clinical codes with which to identify cases with a specific condition.",

All English practices participating in the payfor-performance scheme were included in the analyses: average 8257 each year, covering over 99 % of the English population registered with a general practice. The main outcome measures were levels of achievement on 62 quality-of-care indicators, measured as: reported achievement (levels of care after excluding inappropriate patients); population achievement (levels of care for all patients with the relevant condition) and percentage of available quality points attained. Multilevel mixed effects multiple linear regression models were used to identify population, practice and clinical computing system predictors of achievement.ResultsSeven clinical computer systems were consistently active in the study period, collectively holding approximately 99 % of the market share. Of all population and practice characteristics assessed, choice of clinical computing system was the strongest predictor of performance across all three outcome measures. Differences between systems were greatest for intermediate outcomes indicators (e.g., control of cholesterol levels).ConclusionUnder the UK's pay-for-performance scheme, differences in practice performance were associated with the choice of clinical computing system. This raises the question of whether particular system characteristics facilitate higher quality of care, better data recording or both. Inconsistencies across systems need to be understood and addressed, and researchers need to be cautious when generalising findings from samples of providers using a single computing system.

Grill et al.pollution may share the same source of traffic, we investigated the association of traffic noise levels assessed outdoors and indoors with outdoor nitrogen oxide level (NO2) as a main pollutant emitted by traffic. Additionally we investigated the association of outdoor and indoor night-time noise with noise annoyance in a highly urbanized area of Germany.Methods Long-term exposure to traffic noise was modeled according to the European Directive 2002/49/EC as night-time levels (22-6 h, LNIGHT, in dB(A), at facades of the baseline (2000-2003) addresses of 3883 Heinz Nixdorf Recall study participants. Traffic noise level outside the bedroom window (LNIGHT_OUTWIN) and indoor nighttime noise from traffic (LNIGHT_IN) were modelled using information on noise reduction factors according to room orientation to streets, type of windows, and season-specific ventilation habits, as previously published. For LNIGHT_OUTWIN we used LNIGHT without any changes if room window was located towards the street, and subtracted 20 dB(A) if room windows were located towards another direction. For LNIGHT_IN, we subtracted 30 dB(A) for onelayered or simple windows, and 40 dB(A) for double or soundproofing windows for closed windows, according to the duration when windows were closed during each season. We estimated indoor noise as a weighted mean of 265 summer ([10\u00b0C) and 100 winter (\\10\u00b0C) days. If windows were opened, the level of indoor noise was defined as the level of outdoor noise. We used land use regression to estimate traffic-related NO2. Noise annoyance (scale from 1-no annoyed to 5-very strong annoyance) was assessed by questionnaire. Spearman correlation (r) analyses of LNIGHT, LNIGHT_OUTWIN, and LNIGHT_IN with outdoor NO2 and noise annoyance were performed. Results Mean values for LNIGHT, LNIGHT_OUTWIN and LNIGHT_IN were 45.4 \u00b1 8.7 (range 34.0-76.3), 36.1 \u00b1 13.4 (range 14.0-76.3), and 27.3 \u00b1 15.7 (range 0.0-67.0) dB(A), respectively. 26.9 % of respondents reported noise annoyance at different levels (grade 2 to 5). Correlation between LNIGHT and NO2 was stronger (r = 0.36) compared to LNIGHT_OUTWIN and LNIGHT_IN (r = 0.27 and r = 0.18, respectively). The strongest correlation with noise annoyance was found for LNIGHT_OUTWIN (r = 0.37) compared to LNIGHT (r = 0.28) and LNIGHT_IN (r = 0.19).ConclusionLow correlation of indoor noise estimates with traffic-related air pollution might be more suitable for two-exposure modeling in those areas with high correlations of outdoor traffic noise and ambient traffic-related air pollution; however, the validity of derived indoor noise values needs to be checked.Cycling and sports but not dietary protein are associated with MRI-determined muscle mass in a population based crosssectional study T\u00f6lke A 1 , Freese J 1 , R\u00fc ttgers D 1 , Barbaresko J 1 , Ludwig C 1 , M\u00fc ller HP 2 , Kassubek J 2 , Both M 3 , Lieb W 4 , N\u00f6thlings U 1 University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 2 University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; 3 UKSK Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; 4 Institut f\u00fcr Epidemiologie, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany",

The value and the benefit of a new diagnostic test Vach W 1 Klinische Epidemiologie, Center for Medical Biometry and Medical informatics, Freiburg, Germany Background In developing new diagnostic tests and assessing their benefit for patients, enrichment designs are one popular design. In enrichment designs, only the test positive patients are randomized to the two treatments of interest, typically the standard treatment currently given to all patients and a new treatment expected to improve patient outcomes in test positive patients. Consequently, we can only conclude that the new treatment is beneficial for test positive patients. It may happen that other studies randomizing (also) test negative patients demonstrate (later) that also the test negative patients benefit from the new treatment. Then there is actually no need for the test: We can improve patient outcomes just by giving the new treatment to all patients. Regulatory and HTA agencies have commented in different manners on the question to which degree results from enrichment studies can be used to justify to bring a test into use. Objective",

In this context, an automatic Web crawling approach can help to analyze the structure of the health related Web. By harvesting only such content, it is possible to (i) identify information hubs, (ii) find content providers of high prestige and (iii) identify important topics and trends.In this paper, a German Health Web (GHW) crawler is outlined (i.e. all.de,.at,.ch domains). With the crawled data it is possible to extract the structure of the GHW for (i)-(iii) and to provide access to huge amounts of health-related text material for linguistic analysis. Material/methods Given a set of seed points P, a Web crawler extracts hyperlinks contained in P and traverses the directed graph of the Web [3] . In this context, we obtained P from the Open-Directory Project. Due to the enormous size of the Web [4] , discriminating whether a webpage's content is health-related or not is an important task to reduce the total number of pages that need to be crawled. In this context, a focused crawler uses techniques from the field of machine learning to estimate the relevance of a webpage for the domain of interest [5,6]. We applied well-known text classification methods described in [7, 8] to determine the relevance via SVMs.",

A total of 91 % originates from.de, 6 % from.at and 3 % from.ch domains. For a preliminary analysis of particular and wellknown webpages of the GHW, we generated two sub-graphs with a depth d = 6 for the seed URL (a) www.bmg.bund.de [Nodes = 28776; Edges = 999.130; Average-Degree = 34,72; Network-Diameter = 13] (b) www.rki.de [Nodes = 73694; Edges = 3.325.714; Average-Degree = 45,3; Network-Diameter = 16]. The corresponding.graphml files for BMG/RKI can be downloaded at shcinfo.gecko.hs-heilbronn.de/german-health-web for free. In addition, we can provide other graph files for research purpose, generated on demand for other parts of the GHW. Discussion Several limitations can be identified: First, it is not clear whether P covers a broad amount of topics within the health domain. Second, due to a limited resource amount and time, the data crawled cover only a certain fraction of the estimated GHW. Third, the SVM classifier might have produced false positive results. Moreover, the partial, structural analysis of the crawled data was conducted for two points of interest. Still, as we used graph entry URLs of very high credibility, the resulting graph structure can be assumed as a valid partial representation of the GHW.A first investigation of a randomly selected sample consisting of several hundred pages suggests that our approach seems to produce",
