CXC receptor seven (CXCR7), a newly discovered Chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) receptor, has organ specificity for tumour migration. We hypothesized that CXCR7 expression affects proliferation and migration of MSCs. In present study, we constructed long-term and stable mMSCs lines overexpressing and suppressing CXCR7 modifications with lentiviral vectors. The transduction efficiencies, mRNA and protein expression of CXCR7 were significantly regulated. CXCR7 gene overexpression promoted mMSCs proliferation and migration, whereas suppressing CXCR7 had the opposite effect. Additional CXCL12 improved the vertical migration of mMSCs. The overexpression of CXCR7 increased the MSC-secreted CXCL12, VCAM-1, CD44 and MMP2 levels, which contributed to the improvement of mMSC proliferation and migration. Therefore, overexpressing CXCR7 improved the proliferation and migration of mMSCs, which may be attributable to the CXCL12 secreted by MSCs, leading to a positive feedback loop for CXCL12/CXCR7 axis.

The major findings of the present study were as follows: (1) the overexpression of CXCR7 significantly improved the proliferation and migration of mMSCs; (2) the positive feedback regulation of CXCL12 and the increased expression of The third generation of self-inactivation (SIN) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was chosen as a vector of target gene overexpression in this study. Several studies have confirmed that HIV-1-based SIN lentivirus vectors sustain high levels of transgene expression in human embryonic stem cells, although their application in MSCs is still unknown 24, 25 . Therefore, lentivirus vectors pHBLV-CMVIE-ZsGreen-T2A-Puromycin and pHBLV-U6-ZsGreen-Puromycin were successfully constructed for gene transfection and interference, which contains CMV promoter and U6 promoter.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 121, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 122, "end": 126, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 127, "end": 131, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 132, "end": 136, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 245, "end": 247, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 845, "end": 847, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Improving the proliferation and migration of MSCs to a target tissue is the key issue for improving the efficiency of the therapy. A concentration gradient of CXCL12 can specifically regulate different effects of chemotaxis in stem cells [26] [27] [28] . In a previous study, CXCR4 was considered the unique receptor of CXCL12 and was shown to play an important role in chemotaxis 11, 29 . Balabanian and Burns found that there was another binding site of CXCL12, named RCD1 (CXCR7) in 2006. The affinity of CXCR7 to CXCL12 is 10 times greater than that of CXCR4 11 . However, the lower cell surface expression of CXCR7 than of CXCR4 has seriously restricted the role of the CXCL12/CXCR7 axis on the migration of mMSCs. The present study demonstrates that the overexpression of CXCR7 significantly improved and that the low expression of CXCR7 decreased the proliferation and migratory ability of mMSCs. Additional CXCL12 was added to simulate inflammation microenvironments, which further increased the migratory ability of mMSCs. Our results suggest that the overexpression of CXCR7 have a positive effect on MSC proliferation and migration. However, Liu et al. 30 found that CXCR7 was shown to have no influence on MSC migration in renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury models. Gheisari et al. 31 found that CXCR7-transfected MSCs were trapped in the lungs, whereas native MSCs home very rarely to kidneys and bone marrow. In addition, the activation of CXCR7 may improve the migration of colorectal cancer cells in the lung but not in the liver 9 . Thus, it is suspected that MSCs overexpressing CXCR7 may have organ specificity, especially in the lungs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 243, "end": 247, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 381, "end": 384, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 385, "end": 387, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1166, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1296, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1547, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Paracrine adhesion factors have been proposed to be the primary mechanism for MSC migration 32 .

However, VCAM-1, CD44, and MMP2 increased and decreased significantly after overexpression and suppression of CXCR7, respectively. It has been demonstrated that blocking VCAM-1 by its antibody significantly reduced the migration of MSCs 28 . Further, CD44 and MMP2 play important roles in the migration of MSCs.

We found that the overexpression of CXCR7 in mMSCs not only improved their migration and proliferation but also increased their CXCL12 secretion. The mechanism is possibly described based on the following two phenomena. On one hand, more CXCL12 combined with its ligand CXCR7 when CXCR7 was overexpressed in mMSCs, which may have increased the ability of these cells to migrate. The supplemented CXCL12 may combine with more CXCR7 and CXCR4 on mMSCs in a positive feedback loop, which was also reported in Wang's study 37 . On the other hand, the high expression of CXCR7 may activate the CXCL12/ CXCR7 axis, thus making mMSCs secrete more CXCL12. It was supported by the increasing protein and mRNA level of CXCL12.
