If you would like to try to take a cover shot, keep in mind that we have to be able to add the AVJ masthead at the top and highlights down one or both sides. It's also important to send us an accurate description of the photo, otherwise we might get eagle-eyed members calling to tell us we've got our cows confused -thank you robert Mills.

            "text": "MERS-CoV is genetically and biologically distinct from other known coronaviruses such as the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. It is considered to be a serious public health threat, because the infection can cause severe disease in humans and coronaviruses may adapt to new hosts and become more easily transmittable between humans. 3 The epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection is not yet fully understood. Similar strains of MERS-CoV have been identified in samples taken from camels and humans in the Middle East and in some cases there has been an association between infections in humans and camels, suggesting that camels are a likely primary source of the MERS-CoV infection in humans. 4 Viruses genetically related to MERS-CoV have also been detected in bat species around the world, and a fragment of viral genetic material matching the MERS-CoV was found in one bat from Saudi Arabia. However according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the current evidence does not indicate a direct link between bats and MERS-CoV in humans and further research is warranted. 3 Other species of animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo and wild birds, have tested negative for the presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV. Nevertheless, owing to the relatively small sample sizes, the results of these studies cannot exclude infection in other animal species. 3 The OIE, WHO and FAO emphasise that joint human health and animal health investigations are needed to develop a better understanding of the overall epidemiology of MERS and the role of camels and potentially other animal species in the maintenance and transmission of MERS-CoV. 3 Clusters of confirmed human cases have occurred in healthcare settings and households, but there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission in the community. Immunocompromised persons and those with diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease are considered at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. The WHO recommends that as a general precaution anyone visiting farms or other places where camels are present should practise general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals and following food hygiene practices. 4 For latest information on MERS-CoV, visit the WHO website: www.who.int/ Resolutions are generally of two types -special resolutions and ordinary resolutions. Any resolution to amend the AVA Constitution requires a special resolution. In order to be passed special resolutions require the approval of at least 75% of the members entitled to vote on that resolution.",

The interval between application and slaughter in almost all cases is likely to be many years, with some sheep dying or being used for pet food. To further reduce human health concerns, all four active ingredients were chosen by the developers because they already had widespread and safe use in human and veterinary medicine. Three of the active components are used topically in humans, and LIG and BUP are also administered parenterally.",

The AMH also lists a number of human preparations of LIG used in the nasopharyngeal area or gastrointestinal tract, which results in oral intake of LIG. The AMH does not recognise therapeutic doses of LIG or BUP in humans as a particular hazard. 2 LIG and BUP do not persist in mammals because they are rapidly metabolised, particularly in the liver. The plasma halflives of LIG and BUP in all species are very short (range 1-190 minutes), depending on the species, age, dose and route of administration. The metabolic pathways are common to humans and other mammalian species, including sheep, cattle and pigs. Excretion of parent compounds and their metabolites is rapid and predominantly in the urine. 3, 4 Metabolism results in degradation of the compounds, which is responsible for the loss of local anaesthetic action.",

The incidence of these tumours was dosedependent and there was no significant increase in nasal tumours at either of the two lower dose rates of 15 and 50 mg/kg BW/ day. 4 In this rat study it was reported that some of the 2,6-xylidine evaporated from the feed and was inhaled by the rats throughout the study period. The nasopharangeal anatomy of rats is unlike that of humans, which leads to differences in the amount and distribution of inhaled materials. Rodents are also obligate nose breathers with a highly efficient nasal filtering capacity. A further complication in rats is spontaneous respiratory infections and their sequelae. Rats appear to be uniquely susceptible to chronic inflammation and tumours from insoluble cytotoxic particles. 6, 7 Overall, this makes the rat an unsuitable model for predicting the significance of chemicals on the induction of nasal tumours in humans. The unique characteristics of the rat and the volatility of the 2,6-xylidine make it difficult to place any significance on the appearance of nasal tumours in the chronic rat study. The results of the 2-year rat study using 2,6-xylidine have been extensively reviewed and it is accepted that this metabolite of LIG and BUP does not represent a hazard to human health. 4, 8 The end result is that when meat-producing animals are treated with T-S, the possibility of 2,6-xylidine residues being present and causing problems in humans is not an issue. Furthermore, human pharmaco-vigilance studies over a long period have not revealed any reports of carcinogenicity following the widespread therapeutic use of LIG or BUP.",

Similarly, the acceptable intake of BUP plus metabolites is 0.06 mg/day. Thus, the total acceptable maximum daily intake of the parent local anaesthetics and their metabolites, expressed as parent drug is 0.6 mg (0.54 + 0.06 = 0.6) for a 60-kg human. The standard intake of meat is a total of 0.5 kg/day, made up of the sum of muscle, liver, kidney and fat. The most conservative MRL set for either of the local anaesthetics is for BUP at 0.02 mg/ kg meat. Therefore, the highest acceptable daily consumption of meat from treated animals can be estimated by dividing the total acceptable drug intake of 0.6 mg by the conservative maximum amount of drug permitted in 0.5 kg meat of 0.01 mg. This results in a theoretical maximum daily intake of 60 kg of meat, which would be unrealistic. It must also be stressed that ADIs and the resultant MRLs are levels for regulatory action and are not human health levels. In the case of LIG and BUP for T-S, the ADIs have been calculated using 1000-fold safety factors. This means that the occasional consumption of meat containing residues that marginally exceed the MRL does not translate into a human health hazard.",

Additional pressures to improve farm animal welfare are also being applied by processors of human food and by consumers of animal products. In order to meet these welfare requirements, there is a need for products, such as T-S, that can provide pain relief and infection control.

Such work should provide a registered product that will meet the new and additional requirements of the livestock industries, through expanded therapeutic claims and associated appropriate usage patterns.

Although many of these detections can be explained by the animals having been infected on the mainland, there are occasional animals that have only ever resided in Tasmania, so must have been infected locally. This indicates a low level of transmission of hydatids in Tasmania, but the level of detection in abattoir suggests that transmission is a rare event.",

The Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services advises there has not been any detection of hydatids in people that can be related to infection acquired in Tasmania after 1996 and evidence suggests that transmission to people ceased in Tasmania in the early 1970s. The Tasmanian dogs reported by Jenkins et al. were sampled as part of investigations into cattle infections detected at slaughter and as such comprise a sample that is heavily biased towards high-risk dogs. The prevalence detected in these dogs cannot be considered an indication of the broader situation in Tasmanian dogs and also cannot be reliably compared with the results from a volunteer sample of dogs tested in other states. It is illegal in Tasmania to feed livestock offal to dogs unless it has been cooked to the point of being commercially sterile. Unfortunately, the section in the paper dealing with dog feeding practices did not differentiate Tasmanian results from other states, so does not provide any indication of the level of compliance with this requirement.We are fortunate in Tasmania that, unlike on the mainland, hydatids have never been detected in wildlife. This means that by continuing to educate at-risk groups not to feed livestock offal to dogs we have an effective tool for the control of the disease.Tasmania will continue to follow up all detections of hydatids in livestock at slaughter to investigate and try to eliminate sources of infection. We will also continue to provide targeted information to dog and livestock owners about the steps they should take to prevent the disease.",
