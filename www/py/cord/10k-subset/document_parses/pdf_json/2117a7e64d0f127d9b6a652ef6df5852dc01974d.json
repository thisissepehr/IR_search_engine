            "text": "The incidence of respiratory tract infections in patients seeking medical advice at a community care centre (Dalby) during 1973 and 1974 was studied. About every third patient seen at this primary health station presented with signs of such infections. In the age groups < 10, 10-19, 20-39, 40-59 and ->60 years, respiratory tract infections accounted for 65, 45, 32, 18 and 9% of the total number of diagnoses made during 1974. The aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in a series of patients seen at this health station was studied. The series included randomly selected cases, but excluded children under seven years of age and patients presenting with signs of acute otitis media and tonsillitis. Attempts to establish the aetiology were made on the basis of the history, the clinical examination, and cultures for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, complement fixation tests for influenza A and B, para-influenza 1, 2, and 3, adeno, cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, and Chlamydia psittaci. Paul-Bunnelt test and tests for cold agglutinins were also performed. With this test battery, an aetiological diagnosis was obtained in only 33% of the 101 patients studied. The findings suggest an infection with M. pneumoniae in 16 %, with beta-haemolytic streptococci in 9 %, and with viruses (adeno and para-influenza) in 7 % of the patients. ] he present communication highlights the role ofM. pneumoniae in upper respiratory infections, as few data have appeared on such infections in patients seen in general practice. The difficulty of establishing the aetioIogy of respiratory tract infections and the consequent treatment dilemma is discussed. Zusammenfassung: Hiiufigkeit und Jftiologie yon Atemwegsinfe ktionen in der Allgeraeinpraxis umer besonderer Beriicksichtigung yon Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bei Patienten des Community Care Centers (Dalby) wurde in den Jahren 1973 und 1974 die Hfiufigkeit von Atemwegsinfcktionen untersucht. Bei ungef/ihr jedem dritten der Patienten, die zu dieser Gesundheits-Hauptberatungsstelle kamen, lagen Symptome einer solchen Infektion vor. In den A1tersgruppen < 10, 10-19, 20-39, 40-.59 und -->60 machten Atemwegsinfektionen 65, 45, 32, I8 bzw. 9% der Diagnosen aus, die 1974 insgesamt gestellt wurden. Die ~'Atiologie akuter Atemwegsinfektionen wurde bei einer Reihe yon Patienten dieser Beratungsstelle untersucht. Die Patienten wurden willktirlich ausgew~ihlt, jedoch waren Kinder unter 7 Jahren sowie Patienten mit Symptomen einer akuten Otitis media oder Tonsillitis yon der Priifung ausgeschlossen. Die Feststellung der ~tiologie stfitzte sich auf Krankengeschichte, klinische Untersuchung sowie Kulturen auffl-h/imolytische Streptokokken und Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Komplementbindungstests auf den lnfluenzavirus A und B, den Parainfluenzavirus I, 2 und 3, Adenovirus, Zytomegalievirus und RS-Virus sowie auf Chlamydia psittaci. Ferner wurden der Paul-Bunnell-Test und der Test auf K~ilteagglutinine durchgeffihrt. Mit dieser Testreihe wurde nur bei 32% der 101 untersuchten Patienten eine ~itiologische Diagnose erzielt. Wie aus den Befunden hervorging, war die Infektion bei 16 % auf M. pneumoniae zurtickzufiihren, bei 9 % auf fl-h/imolytische Streptokokken und bei 7 % auf Viren (Adenovirus und Parainfluenzaviren). Der vorliegende Berieht macht deutlich, welche Rolle M. pneumoniae bei Infektionen der oberen Atemwege spielt, da bisher wenig Angaben fiber diese Art von Infektionen bei Patienten von Allgemeinpraktikern vorliegen. In dem Bericht werden die Schwierigkeit, die Ntiologie yon Atemwegsinfektionen festzustellen, und die sich daraus ergebenden Therapieprobleme diskutiert.",

            "text": "Symptoms of respiratory tract infection are one of the most common reasons for a patient to seek a consultation with his physician. The causative agents of respiratory tract infections are known to vary with the season, climate, age of the population, and with the epidemiological environment. Therefore the relative importance of the various agents involved varies widely. It is well known that viruses are the cause of the majority of these infections. More than 150 different viruses have so far been shown to cause infections ol the respiratory tract (17) . There are only minor differences between the clinical signs and symptoms of the infections caused by various viruses. This is also true of respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria, including those caused by beta haemolytic streptococci (4, 5) . It is therefore difficult to establish the aetiology on the basis of the clinical picture in any of these infections.",

Infections are seen in all ages but are more common in older children. The incubation period is usually three weeks or more.

The age and sex distribution are shown in Figure 2 . These patients sought medical advice at the Division of Community Care Sciences, Dalby, or at a primary health station (OVC) in Lund, Sweden. The study was performed during August and September, 1975. Patients under the age of seven were excluded as it was not practical to draw blood from these young patients at a busy health clinic and it was not justified in view of the diagnosis of the children's condition. Patients with acute otitis media or obvious signs of acute tonsillitis were also excluded. All patients in the study paid their first visit to a doctor for the condition under study and had not taken any antibiotics prior to the visit. The patients were asked to describe their symptoms (Table 8) and to note the day of their onset. A clinical examination was performed and the results recorded. A blood sample was drawn and the patients were instructed to return after two weeks for a second blood specimen to be collected. One hundred and one patients out of 113 returned. A control group was formed of 101 patients who presented to the Centre with symptoms other than those related to the respiratory tract. This control group was matched by sex and age to the patients with respiratory tract infections. One serum sample was drawn from these patients for serological tests. Culture techniques Beta-haemolyticstreptococci. In all the patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection a culture was taken from the oropharynx. This was obtained with a cotton-tipped swab and inoculated directly onto a blood agar plate which contained 4 % horse and 4 % sheep blood. Isolated streptococci were grouped according to a method described by Christensen et al (8) .",

Antibodies, at a titre of > 1:10, to all the viruses tested occurred in almost the same proportion in the patients and controls, and the titres had the same distribution. This certainly stresses the fact that it is necessary to examine both acute and convalescent sera. (13), and the Netherlands (16) . The reported incidence of CF antibodies to M. pneumoniae in persons without known respiratory tract infection has been between 5 and 20%. In our control group the corresponding figure was 21%.

            "text": "Most studies of M. pneumoniae infections outside hospitals have been obtained from studies conducted in closed communities, such as military units, university campuses (7, 10) and in families (12) . It has been suggested that M. pneumoniae more often causes upper respiratory tract infections than pneumonia, but figures supporting this assumption are few. The reported incidence of M. pneumoniae in some selected series of patients with upper respiratory tract infections are shown in Table 9 . Incidence figures of M. pneumoniae infections in randomly selected patients in general practice have not to our knowledge been reported. We found evidence of a M. pneumoniae infection in 16 patients; a significant rise in titre of CF antibodies was found in seven, while four had high, but stationary, titres. The epidemiological data and the history strongly suggested an infection with M. pneumoniae in these four patients. Cold agglutinins were found in two of them. In five patients there was no serological evidence of a M. pneumoniae infection, but the organism was recovered from the oro-pharynx. CF, indirect haemagglutination (IHA) and immunofluorescence (IF) tests have been used to detect serum antibodies Infection 4 (1976) Suppl. 1 S (6) Marine recruits (1961) Grayston (15) Miscellaneous groups (1965) of patients Evans (19) University students (1967) Hers (16) Selected groups of (1967) civilians (studied between 1961 and 1966) Glezen (14) Patients in pediatric (1967 The frequency with which M. pneumoniae has been isolated from patients with serological evidence of infection with this organism has been low in most studies. Body fluids contain mycoplasmacidal substances that might influence the recovery rate (27) . The composition of the culture media in general use may not be optimal for the isolation ofM. pneumoniae from clinical specimens, although they may support the growth of \"'laboratory strains\" of M. pneumoniae. In the present study we found that the addition of a reducing substance, i. e. cysteine hydrochloride, gave a higher recovery rate, but this observation needs further evaluation. Cysteine hydrochloride has been used earlier in culture media for ureaplasmas (30) . It should be noted that the isolation rate of more rapidly growing mycoplasma species, e. g. M. hominis, M. orale, and M. salivarium, was not influenced by the presence of this substance. It is notable that M. pneumoniae was isolated from five patients who did not have any se-rological evidence of such an infection, which indicates the role of culture studies in attempts to establish upper respiratory tract infections with this organism. Cold agglutinins are known to occur in 50 to 75 % of patients with signs of pneumonia and with a significant change in the titre of CF antibodies to M. pneumoniae. In our series of patients with non-pneumonic respiratory tract infections, cold agglutinins were found in three of those seven with such a titre change. It has been recently demonstrated that cold agglutinins may also occur in CMV infections of the respiratory tract (24), but we did not find any evidence of such an infection in our cold agglutinin positive cases. The present study seems to indicate that M. pneumoniae infections are not uncommon in patients presenting with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. This type of infection was the most common diagnosis made in our series. But it must be stressed that children below the age of seven and cases of acute tonsillitis and acute otitis media were excluded. The physician often obtains little guidance from the history, and the clinical examination of the patient does not often al- S low the physician to establish the aetiology of a respiratory tract infection. The signs and symptoms in the present series of patients with either a streptococcal, viral or M. pneumoniae infection showed certain common characteristics, but the clinical picture was not sufficiently distinct to make a definite diagnosis without the laboratory tests (Table 8 ). The information the physician obtains from the microbiological laboratory often arrives too late to be of help in the treatment of the individual case. The physician therefore usually has to decide whether or not to treat a respiratory tract infection without the knowledge of the aetiology of the patient's condition. A retrospective study of the treatment which had been giveia to our patients clearly indicates the difficulties involved (Table 10 ). The liberal prescription of penicillin to patients presenting with signs of pharyngo-tonsillitis may seem justified in relation to the difficulty of basing the diagnosis of an infection with beta-haemolytic streptococci group A on clinical grounds (1, 4) , and when it is known that early institution of penicillin reduces the incidence of complications, such as acute glomerulonephritis (18) . Such a therapy may also be of epidemiological significance.",

Viene anche discussa la difficolt~ di stabilire Feziologia delle infezioni dell'apparato respiratorio e i conseguenti dubbi sul trattamento.",

La presente comunicaci6n resalta el papel del M. pneumoniae en las infecciones del tracto respiratorio superior ya que han aparecido pocos datos sobre tales infecciones en pacientes observados en la prfictica diaria. Se discute la dificultad para determinar la etiologia de las infecciones del tracto respiratorio y el dilema de establecer un tratamiento adecuado.Samenvatting: De frequentie van luchtweginfecties bij pati~nten die voor een consult kwamen in het gemeenscbaps gezondheidscentrum (Dalby) gedurende 1973 en 1974 werd onderzocht. Ongeveer iedere derde patient die in dit eerstelijns gezondheidscentrum werd gezien vertoonde symptomen van een dergelijke infectie. In de leeftijdsgroepen _< 10, 10-19, 20-39, 40-59 en -> 60 iaar vertegenwoordigden luchtweginfecties 65, 45, 32, 18 en 9% van het totaal aantal gedurende 1974 gestelde diagnoses. De etiologic van acute luchtweginfecties bij een serie pati~nten die in dit gezondheidscentrum werden gezien, werd onderzocht. De serie omvatte aselect gekozen gevallen, uitgesloten waren echter kinderen jonger dan 7 jaar en pati~nten die symptomen van acute otitis of tonsillitis vertoonden. Er werd getracht de etiologic vast te stellen op basis van de anamnese, het lichamelijk 0nderzoek en kweken op beta haemolytische streptococcen en M. pneumoniae, complement bindingsreacties voor influenza A en B, parainfluenza 1, 2 en 3, adeno-, cytomegalovirus en respiratoir syncytium vormend virus en Chlamydia psittaci. De Paul-Bunnell test op koude agglutininen werd ook verricht. Met deze testbatterij werd een etiologische diagnose gesteld in slechts 32 % van de 101 bestudeerde pati~nten. De uitslagen laten in 16 % een infectie met M. pneumoniae zien, in 9 % met beta-haemolytische streptococcen en in 7 % met virussen (adeno-, en para-influenza). Deze communicatie benadrukt de rol van M. pneumoniae in hogere luchtweginfecties, waar tot nu toe weinig gegevens zijn gepublicceerd over dergelijke infecties bij pati~nten in de huisartsenpraktijk. De moeilijkheden rond het vaststellen van de etiologic van luchtweginfecties en het daaruit voorkomende behandelingsdilemma wordt besproken.Riassunto: E' stata studiata la frequenza di infezioni dell'apparato respiratorio in pazienti che hanno richiesto una visita medica al Centro di Dalby negli anni 1973-74. Circa un terzo dei pazienti presentatisi a questo Centro Sanitario di screening presentavano segni di tall infezioni. Nei gruppi di etg inferiori a 10 anni, tra 10-19, 20-39, 40-59 e superiori, o pari, a 60 anni, le infezioni dell'apparato respiratorio corrispondevano al 65, 45, 32, 18 e 9% del numero totale di diagnosi dell'anno 1974. E' stata anche studiata la eziologia delle infezioni acute delFapparato respiratorio in un gruppo di pazienti osservati in questo Centro. Questi gruppi comprendevano soggetti selezionati a caso, con l'esclusione di bambini al di sotto di 7 annie di pazienti che presentavano segni di otite media acuta e tonsillite. Si tent6 di stabilire l'eziologia sulla base della anamnesi, dell'esame obiettivo e degli esami culturali per lo Streptococco Beta-emolitico e per il M. pneumoniae, nonch6 mediante tests di fissazione del complemento per influenza A e B, para influenza 1, 2 e 3, adenovirus, citomegalovirus, virus respiratorio sinciziale e Chlamydia psittaci. Furono anche praticati test di Paul-Bunnell e agglutinine de freddo. Utilizzando questa batteria di tests una diagnosi eziologica fu ottenuta solo nel 32% dei 101 pazienti studiati e i dati ottenuti indieano un'infezione con M.",
