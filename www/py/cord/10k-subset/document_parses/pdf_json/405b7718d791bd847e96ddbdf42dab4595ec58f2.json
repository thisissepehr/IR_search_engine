            "text": "Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a gene-delivery platform for transiently introducing a single gene or several genes of interest to different cell types and tissues. modRNA is considered to be a safe vector for gene transfer, as it negligibly activates the innate immune system and does not compromise the genome integrity. The use of modRNA in basic and translational science is rising, due to the clinical potential of modRNA. We are currently using modRNA to induce cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury. Major obstacles in using modRNA for cardiac ischemic disease include the need for the direct and single administration of modRNA to the heart and the inefficient translation of modRNA due to its short half-life. Modulation of the 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR) to enhance translation efficiency in ischemic cardiac disease has great value, as it can reduce the amount of modRNA needed per delivery and will achieve higher and longer protein production post-single delivery. Here, we identified that 5 0 UTR, from the fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase 1D (Ces1d), enhanced the translation of firefly luciferase (Luc) modRNA by 2-fold in the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, we identified, in the Ces1d, a specific RNA element (element D) that is responsible for the improvement of modRNA translation and leads to a 2.5-fold translation increment over Luc modRNA carrying artificial 5 0 UTR, post-MI. Importantly, we were able to show that 5 0 UTR Ces1d also enhances modRNA translation in the liver, but not in the kidney, post-ischemic injury, indicating that Ces1d 5 0 UTR and element D may play a wider role in translation of protein under an ischemic condition.",

            "text": "Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, killing about 610,000 people per year. 1, 2 Many scientists around the world are studying different approaches to induce cardiac regeneration in hope to unravel new treatments that can improve cardiac function post-ischemic injury. Genetic medicine is one of the avenues of research to treat a failing heart postmyocardial infarction (MI). 3 In this research, we aimed to adjust gene expression in the heart using viral vectors, small molecules, or an RNA-based approach to promote cardiac protection and cardiovascular or cardiac regeneration in ischemic cardiac disease. Modified messenger RNA (modRNA) is a novel gene therapy platform that can be used to alter the levels of proteins in mammalian cells and tissues 4, 5 and to treat heart diseases. [6] [7] [8] The concept of therapeutically altering mRNA expression has great potential in the treatment of human diseases. 9 To date, several therapeutic approaches using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotides have been successfully tested to reduce mRNA levels in the cells. 10 , 11 Yet, the upregulation of proteins in tissues is challenging, mostly to the high amount of mRNA needed to treat human tissue. The supply of a large amount of mRNA in vivo can subsequently elicit a higher immune response. Preclinical studies with modRNA showed that due to the transient expression of modRNA (gene expression return to baseline is a few days), modRNA will be needed, both in direct or intravenous delivery methods, to be redelivered to achieve higher gene expression. 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] The expression of genes is controlled intricately at the post-transcriptional level. 16 The level of an individual mRNA type inside of a cell does not ensure the synthesis of comparable amounts of respective proteins, 17 both positive and negative modulators that influence translation and maintain certain levels of protein. Eukaryotic gene translation is regulated in the translation level by several components, including 5 0 untranslated region (UTR), 18-20 3 0 UTR, [21] [22] [23] poly(A) tail, [24] [25] [26] [27] cap structure, [28] [29] [30] [31] etc. There are multiple regulatory elements within the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA, which are critical for the stability and translation of mRNA into protein. 32, 33 Moreover, the length and secondary structure of 5 0 UTR and mutations within the 5 0 UTR have been reported to be associated with certain human diseases. 34 The 5 0 UTR plays a significant role in the regulation of translational efficiency by helping the ribosome to bind the messenger RNA (mRNA) in the proximity of the start codon and thus, is a main contributor to the cellular proteome. 35 Additionally, certain RNA elements within the 5 0 UTR may change its secondary structure (e.g., internal ribosome entry sites [IRESs], upstream start codon (AUG)s, or upstream open reading frames [uORFs] ) and can be an important contributor of the entire translation rate. 36, 37 Besides, 5 0 UTRs can contain sequence elements that can function as binding sites for regulatory proteins. 33 Until this date, modRNA, which had been used preclinically in cardiac research using artificial 5 0 UTR (36 nt), was first described by Warren et al. 38 Asrani et al. 39 has used in vitro screening for optimization mRNA 5 0 UTR to improve expression of arginase 1 (ARG1). They showed that plasmid-based screening methods do not correlate with protein expression driven by exogenously expressed mRNA and that improved 5 0 UTR but not 3 0 UTR appears to be the key driver in protein expression for exogenously delivered mRNA.",

In total, we detected 14,552 genes and 2,397 proteins in our samples. With the comparison of the two datasets, we found 2,272 genes with corresponding proteins. Out of all genes with corresponding proteins, 239 genes and 120 proteins were differentially expressed (q value < 0.05), 4 h post-MI. 24 h post-MI, 1,702 genes and 272 proteins were differentially expressed. Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of gene expression (Figures 1B and S1A) and protein levels ( Figure 1C ) shows that in both cases, the experimental groups are clustered together, demonstrating significant differences in the transcriptome and proteome post-MI. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between changes in gene expression and protein expression, both 4 h post-MI (r squared = 0.02; Figure 1D ) and 24 h post-MI (r squared = 0.13; Figure 1E ). Whereas we found a significant correlation between the changes in gene expression and protein levels in the ischemic heart post-MI and in our search for a 5 0 UTR element that may elevate translation of modRNA in the heart post-MI, we were interested in identifying genes with a significant noncorrelation relationship between mRNA and protein expression. Therefore, we screened for genes that encode for proteins with elevated levels in 4 or 24 h post-MI (fold change > 2) and mRNA downregulated at 4 or 24 h post-MI (fold change < 0.64) and 5 0 UTR shorter than 100 bp. We were able to identify 3 genes in 4 h ( Figure 1F ) and 18 genes in 24 h ( Figure 1G) and Serpina 1b are present in both our 4-and 24-h screen results), with an upregulated protein expression not related to their mRNA expression post-MI. In addition, we validate Ces1d expression results using qPCR and western blot, showing similar mRNA and protein expression as evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomic analysis (Figures S1B-S1D).",

Interestingly, 4 out of the 5 elements (elements B, C, D, and E) were conserved among species ( Figure 5A ). Based on this information, we designed a Luc modRNA construct carrying different 5 0 UTR elements of Ces1d (elements A-E) and compared its translation ability in neonatal rat CM to Luc-Ces1d ( Figures 5B and 5C ). Our results indicated a significant reduction in translation ability in elements A, B, C, and E but not in D (Figure 5C ). We hypothesized that element D is the RNA element that is responsible for the higher translation ability of Luc-Ces1d. To test our hypothesis, we compared in an ischemic heart model the expression of Luc-Ces1d or Luc-element D with Luc-Control over 3 days ( Figure 5D ). Our results show that Luc modRNA, carrying 5 0 UTR of Ces1d or element D, has higher translation in comparison to Luc-Control ( Figure 5E ). Intriguingly, element D alone had a significantly higher translation in the heart at day 3 post-MI (Figure 5D ). Overall, with the combination of the 3-day readout, Lucelement D has a 2.5-fold higher translation in the heart post-MI in comparison to the widely used artificial 5 0 UTR (Luc-Control). However, Luc-element D failed to increase translation over Luc-Ces1d in liver ischemic injury ( Figures S4A and S4B ) and over Luc-Ces1d or Luc-Control in heart nonischemic injury ( Figures S5A and S5B ).",

            "text": "The use of modRNA as a gene-delivery tool is growing in the field of therapeutic medicine. Our laboratory aims to use modRNA to induce cardiac protection and cardiovascular or cardiac regeneration postmyocardial infarction. 8 Zangi et al. 6 have shown that immediate delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A modRNA in a MI mouse model led to induction of cardiovascular regeneration. A follow-up study in large animals shows a significant improvement of cardiac function when VEGF-A modRNA was delivered 1 week post-MI. 40 Recently, it was shown that intradermal delivery of VEGF-A modRNA in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes is safe and may promote angiogenesis. 41 www.moleculartherapy.org heart-failure patients. In parallel, other groups are using the modRNA platform in preclinical studies of different liver diseases to deliver different target genes. The different liver disease models that have been used are for factor IX deficiency hemophilia B, 42 acute intermittent porphyria, 43 glycogen storage disease type 1A, 44 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 45 alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, 46 Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, 47 and urea cycle disorder 48 with target genes of FIX, PBGD, glucose-6-phosphatase, ADAMTS13, SERPINA1, bilirubin-UGT, and ornithine transcarbamoylase, respectively. As was described above, both the heart and liver disease have been heavily studied in search for new treatments. One of the obstacles in moving to large animals and clinical trials is the need for a large amount of modRNA to transfect human or large-animal heart and liver. In addition, due to the short expression of modRNA, there might be a need to deliver the mod-RNA several times. In order to reduce the need for a large amount of modRNA for delivery, we aim to improve modRNA translation so the amount of protein that has been received from the same amount of modRNA will be higher. Several elements within RNA are responsible for the regulation of translation, including type of nucleotides, poly(A) tail length, or the structure of 5 0 UTR, 3 0 UTR, and cap analog. We showed that replacement of pseudouridine with N1-Methyl-Pseudouridine-5'-Triphosphate (1-M-pseudouridine) results in a higher modRNA translation in the heart of the latter. 4 In addition we found that a longer poly(A) tail can increase the translation of the modRNA in vivo (unpublished data). Here, we describe a unique first-of-this-kind screen, comparing proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to identify the 5 0 UTR sequence that can increase the translation of modRNA in an ischemic condition with comparison to the widely used artificial 5 0 UTR that has been used in previous modRNA publications. [4] [5] [6] 14, 40, 41 Our data show that there is a positive correlation at both 4 and 24 h post-MI in mRNA levels and protein intensity in the ischemic heart. However, we were able to identify 19 different genes with negative correlation, in which their mRNA level was reduced or unchanged, whereas their protein levels were upregulated, 4 and 24 h post-MI. The average length of 5 0 UTRs is $100 to $220 nt across species. 49 In vertebrates, longer 5 0 UTRs tend to be associated with poor translation. 50 Therefore, we decided to select 5 genes with the shortest 5 0 UTR (<100 base pairs) (Figure 1 ).",

Ces1d belongs to a family of carboxylesterases that have important roles in lipid metabolism, and they hydrolyze endogenous esters and thioesters. Carboxylesterases are known for involvement in the detoxification of environmental toxicants, as well as the prodrug metabolism. Ces1d is the functional mouse ortholog of human CES1 and has similar protein-expression profiles at different cells or tissues as CES1. Several roles of Ces1d have been re-ported to be directly associated with lipid metabolism. [62] [63] [64] As lipid metabolism is an important process for normal heart function, fatty acids are the preferred substrates under aerobic conditions. 65 As Ces1d association with lipid metabolism and as MI lead to alteration of the lipid metabolism, we hypothesize that Ces1d mRNA has been triggered by the ischemic condition in the heart post-MI, which leads it to translate better. We showed that element D is the RNA element in Ces1d that is responsible for the elevation in mRNA translation post-MI (Figure 4 ). It will be interesting to evaluate the element D and Ces1d in different ischemic conditions and different organs bedsides the heart, liver, and kidney. The fact that Ces1d gave higher translation in the ischemic heart and liver but not the kidney is interesting, as all three organs primarily use fatty acid oxidation for energy. This may indicate that each organ and physiological condition will need a separate evaluation using a similar approach as ours.",

            "text": "A)-tailed RNA was prepared by the Epigenomics Core at Cornell Medical College, with the mRNA Seq Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and used to create libraries for HiSeq 2000 sequencing (Illumina). We used single, 50-bp reads for sequencing. We obtained a mean of 30 million reads per sample, with a mean quality score of 35.2. We used Partek flow software for data analysis. RNA-seq reads were aligned to mm10 with STAR version 2.53a. Read counts were generated by the application of the Partek expectation-maximization (E/M) algorithm to University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), RefSeq 2017-08-02. Counts were normalized with trimmed mean of maximum (TMM)values algorithm, and the Partek flow gravitational search algorithm (GSA) was used for statistical analysis. The RNA-seq data used in this study is available using GenBank: GSE138201.All solvents were high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade from Sigma-Aldrich, and all chemicals, where not stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For ample preparation, samples were lysed in Biognosys' lysis buffer with a TissueLyser II bead mill (QIAGEN) using stainless-steel grinding beads for 3 min at 30 Hz. Samples were treated with benzonase after lysis to reduce DNA contamination. Protein concentrations of the lysates were estimated using a UV-VIS (visible) spectrometer (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG Labtech). Approximately 100 mg of protein from each sample was denatured using Biognosys' denature buffer, reduced using Biognosys' reduction solution for 60 min at 37 C and alkylated using Biognosys' alkylation solution for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, digestion to peptides was carried out using 3 mg of trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 C.Peptides were desalted using C18 MacroSpin columns (The Nest Group), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and dried down using a SpeedVac system. Peptides were resuspended in 50 mL liquid chromatography (LC) solvent A (1% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid[FA]) and spiked with Biognosys' iRT (indexed retention time) kit calibration peptides. Peptide concentrations were determined using a UV-VIS spectrometer (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG Labtech).For high pH reverse-phase (HPRP) fractionation, equal volumes of samples from each condition were pooled. Ammonium hydroxide was added to all pools to a pH value > 10. The fractionation was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS Pump (Thermo Scientific) on an Acquity UPLC CSH (ultra-performance liquid chromatography charged surface hybrid) C18 1.7 mm, 2.1 \u00c2 150 mm column (Waters). The gradient was 2% to 35% solvent B in 10 min; solvents were the following: A, 20 mM ammonium formate in H 2 O, and B, acetonitrile. Fractions were taken every 15 s and sequentially pooled to 4 fraction pools. These were dried down and resolved in 20 mL solvent A. Prior to mass spectrometric analyses, they were spiked with Biognosys' iRT kit calibration peptides. Peptide concentrations were determined using a UV-VIS spectrometer (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG Labtech).",
