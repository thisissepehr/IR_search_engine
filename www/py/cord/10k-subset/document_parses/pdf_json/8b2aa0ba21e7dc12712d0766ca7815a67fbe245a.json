Methods: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis.

Rossaint et al. [14] first reported that iNO improved oxygenation in patients with ARDS in 1993. Subsequent studies showed similar improvements in oxygenation in a dosedependent manner without better outcomes [10] . Multiple systematic reviews have shown that iNO does not reduce the mortality among patients with ARDS, nor does it shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and it may even increase the incidence of renal impairment [9] . Nevertheless, one study showed that low iNO doses (< 5 ppm) improved lung function in ARDS survivors at 6 months [15] . Generally, iNO dilates blood vessels of ventilated alveoli and increases their blood flow, thereby counteracting the ventilation/perfusion mismatch [16] . Improvements in oxygenation occur rapidly, but the treatment does not practically resolve the disease. If the disease progresses, the alveoli will continue to collapse and the effects of iNO will disappear over several days. In our study, causes of lung injury, such as vessel rupture and CPB, were eliminated by the time the surgery was completed. This may be why the effects of iNO on oxygenation were obvious and sustained. Our results are similar to those of Prendergast et al. in their treatment of hypoxemia with iNO after coronary artery bypass grafting [17] . Another possible mechanism behind the beneficial outcomes after iNO is related to its anti-inflammatory effects. NO is involved in various physiological and pathological processes. It can be either protective or destructive in different conditions and according to the dose and time course [16, 18] . Studies in different animal models have demonstrated that iNO ameliorates lung injury by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines and oxidative damage [19] [20] [21] . A recent study on iNO-mediated prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in Europe showed that iNO treatment may decrease several inflammatory and fibrotic factors in the lungs [22] . Preemptive iNO in human liver transplantation surgery led to clear anti-inflammatory effects in liver grafts which protected graft function, ameliorated pathological changes, and reduced postoperative morbidity [23] . In our study, we found no evidence of inflammation modulation since postoperative C-reactive protein levels were similar in the two groups. However, we speculate that the effects of iNO were associated with regulation of inflammation for several reasons: (1) systemic inflammation causes perioperative hypoxemia in AADA [24] ; (2) treatments using systemic antiinflammatory medicines such as glucocorticoid, sivelestat, and ulinastatin could play a role in attenuating hypoxemia [25, 26] . In our study, there was a trend toward lower inpatient mortality in the iNO treatment group, but this was not significant. Patients with AADA often were in critical condition and could have had complications other than lung injury.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 122, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 659, "end": 663, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 814, "end": 818, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1386, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1683, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1684, "end": 1687, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1838, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1839, "end": 1843, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1848, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2027, "end": 2031, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2249, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2510, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2576, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2731, "end": 2735, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2739, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Some ARDS studies indicated that iNO can adversely affect renal function [9] ; however, the mechanism is unclear.
