These data provide a wealth of detailed information that can yield significant insight into macromolecular function. To use this information most effectively, visualization tools were developed and are increasingly becoming everyday tools for biologists. For example, many biochemists regularly view protein structures to gain insight into protein function (Fig. 1) . Chemists look at ligand-binding sites as part of drug design. Molecular biologists view RNA structures and complexes with proteins to gain insight into RNA signal and message processing. Some aspects of structure visualization remain mostly the domain of the specialist, such as molecular motion and large-scale molecular assemblies. Even in these intrinsically more complex fields, however, resources are beginning to enable bench biologists to visualize and use this information.",

Most of these tools have a large set of features in common, including standard representations (ribbon, space-filling, ball-and-stick and so on) and coloring schemes (elementbased coloring of atoms, coloring by secondary review protein three-dimensional structures are consolidated into a single data repository, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) 1 . Three primary distribution sites (RSCB PDB 5 , PDB Europe and PDB Japan; Table 1 ) provide access to the same underlying data bank, each with a wide range of integrated visualization and analysis tools. In addition, the PDB is mirrored at many other sites, some of which provide innovative visualization tools tailored to make specific questions easier to answer ( Table 1) . Most of these sites offer, embedded directly in their web-pages, one or more molecular graphics tools (for example, Jmol, PyMol, KiNG and Mage 6 ).

Entrez Structure and SRS 3D 7 allow the sequence to be aligned to any related threedimensional structure (Fig. 1f) . So far, experimental threedimensional structures have been determined for less than 1% of all known proteins (based on direct links from PDB to protein sequences in UniProt 8 ). However, for around 42-48% of all proteins, at least part of their sequence is considered significantly similar to a PDB entry, so that some structural information can be inferred 9, 10 . Several websites (for example, Swiss-Model 11 ) provide comparative models for such cases 12, 13 . Each service uses slightly varying cut-off criteria for defining 'significant sequence similarity' (for example, in some cases depending on the length of aligned regions), but generally >40% sequence identity to a PDB structure is considered sufficiently good to create a high-quality comparative model structure 10 . These comparative models can be accessed at a single consolidated website, the Protein Model Portal (PMP) 10 . The original PDB templates also include information on experimental conditions, ligands and cofactors, which can be relevant in deciding to use or discard a comparative model. For sequences where no template PDB structure can be found by the above resources, it may be possible to calculate a structure using so-called ab initio methods 14 . However, in spite of progress 15 , ab initio methods still require much improvement 14 and we recommend they be used with caution.",

To gain an initial overview of a protein structure, it is often useful to choose a representation that hides side chain atoms; ribbon-like representations do that well and also convey information about secondary structure (Fig. 1a-d) . Ligand molecules are best displayed in space-filling or ball-and-stick atom representations. Many of the websites in Table 1 provide such a view (for example, FirstGlance, among others), some by default. Typically, each protein chain is colored differently, thus giving a quick insight into the number of molecules present in the PDB entry. To highlight overall shape and form, nonphotorealistic rendering can be very effective (Fig. 1e) , especially with images for presentation and publication. Some molecular graphics tools (for example, Chimera 16 review sequence and the three-dimensional structure, and further enable interaction between these two views (Fig. 1j) . For example, clicking on a residue in the sequence view causes the corresponding residue to be highlighted and selected in the three-dimensional view, and vice versa. This feature can significantly help a scientist in understanding and using three-dimensional structures. For example, by viewing the location of key residues or sequence motifs, a scientist can assess whether they are likely to be accessible for posttranslational modification, such as phosphorylation 21 . Some viewers (for example, STRAP 19 ) go one step further, showing structure integrated with a multiple sequence alignment viewer-a feature we anticipate will continue to become available for other viewers 22 .",

Each X-ray structure has a resolution value, that is, a measure of the crystal order. The expected error in the threedimensional atomic coordinates is correlated to, but much smaller than, the resolution. an average resolution is about 2.5 \u00c5, and 1.2 \u00c5 is very high quality 112 . at low resolution (\u22654 \u00c5), there is a significant chance of errors in the structure. Each atom also has a B-factor, a parameter correlated with molecular motion, and many molecular graphics tools can use this parameter to color the molecule. however, the correlation with motion is only partial, as other effects contribute to the B-factor 113 . regions with very high B-factor (>80) should generally be treated as of unknown structure. The goodness of fit of the structure to the X-ray crystal data is indicated by the R-value and free R-value 114 , where values of around 20% are considered to indicate a good structure. The difference between the R-value and the free R-value should be low. The goodness of fit can be examined at the Electron Density Server 115 . It can be useful to also check further independent measures of structure accuracy, and many are available directly on the web page for each structure at the rcSB PDB site. The PDBe site also has several useful services for assessing accuracy, particularly PDBsum 29 . a very useful, and independent, accuracy estimate is also available from ProSa-Web 111 , which can show residue-specific quality scores mapped on the threedimensional structure (table 1). When viewing crystal structures, it is important to be aware that PDB entries only give explicit coordinates of the 'asymmetric subunit' of the crystal (that is, the smallest portion of a crystal needed to produce the unit cell of the crystal) which often is only part of the full biologically relevant assembly (Fig. 2) .",

The ability to easily see where sequence features are located in the three-dimensional structure can be of substantial practical value to bench biochemists and molecular biologists.

In fact, a large percentage of PDB entries contain not just a single protein chain but several. In some cases, this means identical subunits assembled together; in other cases, it means a complex of several different protein chains. The arrangement of subunits, and of the interface residues that form the subunit-subunit contacts, is often of biological significance. Several websites specialize in finding and visualizing subunit-subunit interface residues 32 . In PDBsum 29 the interacting residues, and the types of their interaction across the interface, are shown schematically. MolSurfer (Table 1 ) provides a range of methods that help users explore macromolecular interfaces. For symmetric assemblies (dimers, trimers and so on), the PDB entry of an X-ray crystal structure will often have explicit boX 2 nmr StructureS about 13% of PDB entries are derived from Nmr spectroscopy. Nmr structures are usually deposited in the PDB as an ensemble of 10-50 structures (Fig. 3) , providing a visual representation of precision. The ensemble precision derives not from the dynamics of the molecule in solution but from the lack of data to describe the structure fully. The method used for structure calculation also affects the ensemble precision, and recently a significantly improved method has been developed that ensures that the ensemble precision more truly reflects the data 120 . often, a single 'minimized average' structure, or a representative structure, is also provided in the PDB. The ensemble precision is often measured as the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation to the average structure, where a value of about 2.0 \u00c5 is typical 121 ; more precise ensembles with lower r.m.s. deviation may indicate an overfitting of data, rather than high quality. an ensemble r.m.s. deviation of \u22655 \u00c5 generally indicates a low quality structure, although values this low may occur, for example, in a structure comprising two well ordered domains connected by a flexible linker region. There is still no standardized measure for assessing the goodness of fit of structures to Nmr data, although it is common to report the r.m.s. deviation of violations of distance and other constraints. as with X-ray structures, it can be useful to check independent measures of accuracy (for example, available at rcSB PDB, PDBe and via camE/ProSa-Web 111 ).",

            "text": "compared with X-ray crystallography, Nmr has the advantage that it is not necessary to crystallize a molecule; instead, Nmr usually studies biomolecules in solution, hence arguably in a more natural state. Nmr structures also lack the heavy metal contaminants of many X-ray structures. Nmr can also dynamically track specific reactions in living cells 122 and can more easily study weak associations as well as disordered protein states 123 . however, Nmr has the disadvantage that it imposes an upper limit on the size of the molecule studied: the largest molecule solved by Nmr so far is 82 kDa (ref. 124) , and most Nmr structures are 25-30 kDa or less. another disadvantage is that, for the same molecular system, Nmr usually produces less precise structures than does X-ray crystallography. as with X-ray crystallography, studying structures by Nmr often requires tampering with the target macromolecule. Frequently, truncated segments, often single domains, are studied by Nmr, rather than full-length proteins. In addition, mutations of surface residues are often introduced to avoid aggregation. Finally, post-translational modifications that are present in vivo are often missing in Nmr structures. Nmr structures are calculated automatically from constraints derived from the Nmr spectra, primarily constraints on interatomic distances 125 . however, manual checks are sometimes needed during structure determination, and several molecular graphics tools (for example, molmol 35 ) offer the possibility of easily displaying Nmr data, such as distance constraints, directly on the structure. In contrast to X-ray crystal structure calculation, it is customary to retain residues with very little or no data, with the result that some regions of the molecule can be very divergent in the ensemble. The display of ensembles requires prior superposition of the structures. Some graphics packages offer automatic superposition (vmD 26 , molmol 35 ), but for more difficult cases, with highly divergent regions, dedicated programs should be used; for example, ThESEUS 35 review three-dimensional coordinates for only one monomer. To construct the coordinates for all subunits in the biologically relevant assembly, we recommend PISA 33 (see Box 1, Fig. 2 ).",

The upper size limit is mainly the sample thickness (up to a few hundred nanometers). compared with X-ray and Nmr structures, electron microscopy is almost always at lower resolution.

At present, researchers typically use a hierarchical approach to visualizing large macromolecular assemblies. For portions for which atomic information is available, atomic representations may be used, and then abstracted to simpler, surface-based representations. These surfaces may then be integrated with density sections or volumes from the lower-resolution methods (for example, electron microscopy tomography). This approach scales nicely from the level of atoms to the level of cells, allowing the use of simpler, more abstracted representations of the individual components as one moves to large systems, such as intracellular components (Fig. 7a) or even whole-cell visualization (Fig. 7b) , and to multiscale movies 85 .",

However, a more recent technology, computer autofabrication, or 'solid printing', initially developed for industrial rapid prototyping, is now being used to produce physical molecular models. Such models bring back the properties of real-object perception and manipulation that were lost when the model resided only in the computer. Over the past decade, the variety of such printers has increased steadily as the entry price has dropped to below $10,000 and printing services have sprouted to fill this new niche. Because accurate and complex tangible models can be produced automatically as computer 'printouts' of molecular geometrical representations, the barrier to custom production has disappeared.

The fields of information visualization and visual analytics have developed over the past decade to address problems in making such complex data intelligible and navigable 95, 96 .
