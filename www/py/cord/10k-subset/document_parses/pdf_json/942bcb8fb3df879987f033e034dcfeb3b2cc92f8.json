However a distinctive pattern was evident in the averaged data, and had a striking relationship to school holiday periods, which were associated with troughs in admission rates, followed by a sharp rise to a peak after the beginning of each school term. The pattern was most striking in 4-10 year olds but was also seen in 0-3 year olds who do not attend school. This is even more significant considering that Brighton is a holiday resort and would experience a substantial increase in childhood population during holiday periods. The authors surmised that this pattern was unlikely to be explained by stress or by aeroallergen exposure (house dust mite levels are higher in the home than at school), and postulated that viruses were acquired from other localities by individuals during holiday travel and were then rapidly spread through a susceptible population, both at school and amongst younger siblings.

Identification rates will depend on the organisms prevalent during the study, which will vary seasonally and from year to year, and with the age of subjects studied. They will also depend on the quality and intensity of prospective follow-up-whether regular investigations between symptomatic episodes are performed, the criteria for investigation of symptomatic episodes, and the time elapsed between notification and investigation of a symptomatic episode. Technical problems include the difficulties of obtaining a satisfactory clinical specimen, of transporting and storing it in adequate conditions to preserve identifiable virus, and of availability of sensitive cell lines for screening. In addition, laboratories vary considerably in their experience and success rate in culture of specific viruses. Certain of the respiratory viruses are particularly difficult-coronaviruses because they require organ or animal cultures (sensitive cell lines and antigens for serology have limited availability), rhinoviruses because of their fastidiousness for certain cells and culture conditions and the fact that the large number of serotypes precludes serology for screening, respiratory syncytial virus because of its sensitivity to freezing and thawing, and parainfluenza viruses because they will only culture satisfactorily on primary cell lines.

A summary of those studies which were informative for rates of viral identification during wheezy illnesses is presented in Table 2 . The studies are divided into two main groups. Section A (incidental studies) lists studies in which the episodes selected for investigation were respiratory infections or wheezing illnesses in children as they presented to a clinic or to a hospital for admission. They are generally based on large subject populations and can be regarded as crosssectional studies extending over a period of time. Section B (prospective studies) lists studies in which a relatively small group of children (upper portion) or adults (lower portion) with asthma or 'wheezy bronchitis' were followed, some with symptom or medication diaries, for periods of 3 to 30 months, and were investigated during respiratory infections (which they were usually requested to report), as well as on a regular basis in some studies. In both sections, the denominator for total and specific viral identification rates is the number of episodes of wheezing illness investigated. Some of these are explicitly stated to be asthma attacks, others are described as respiratory tract infection with wheezing, wheezy bronchitis, or bronchitis/bronchiolitis. Studies in the latter category were only included if the definition given of bronchitis or bronchiolitis was not restricted to infancy, and included the features of wheezing or airtrapping (some studies in the 1970s appeared to apply the label of'bronchiolitis' to any wheeze associated respiratory infection in childhood [37, 44] ). Blanks in the viral identification section of the table may mean that the virus was looked for but not found, or that it was not looked for. In many studies it in ot clear which of these is the case, but where the authors reported finding a virus in another part of the paper but not specifically among wheezy subjects, the rate is listed as zero. It can be generally assumed that blanks under enteroviruses and adenoviruses mean that the virus was looked for and not found, as these viruses will grow readily in most culture systems, whereas for coronaviruses, the studies that did not report them generally did not look for them. In the case of the other viruses, the situation is not clear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1722, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 273, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Virus identification rates in exacerbations of asthma and wheezing (Table 2)"}, {"text": "The incidental studies (Section a. Table 2) show overall viral identification rates of 9-8-48-6%, and when these are weighted by the number of episodes studied, and averaged, an overall identification rate of 24-0%) of 4896 episodes were positive. At least some of the variability between studies is understandable in terms ofthe populations studied and methods used. There were only three I9 studies with identification rates less than 20% [19, 25, 42] , and these rates were obtained from children admitted to hospital with asthma, whereas the other studies all included outpatients, and the highest rates were obtained from studies in primary care. This probably reflects the time delay between initial respiratory symptoms, and viral investigation. As mentioned above, respiratory symptoms precede the onset of wheezing often by several days, and further time may elapse before a patient is admitted to hospital. This explanation is consistent with the finding of Horn et al. [15] that 33% of specimens obtained in the first 5 days of illness were positive, whereas only 18% of specimens obtained after 5 days were positive. When we examine the individual viruses identified, weighted averages indicate rhinoviruses, RSV and parainfluenza viruses to be the predominant organisms. All the studies found RSV and parainfluenza viruses, and all but one found rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. The exception was the study of Disney et al. [25] , which only used two cell lines, neither of which was sensitive to rhinovirus, and had the lowest overall identification rate. Among the viruses the rate of rhinovirus identification was the most variable between studies, as might be expected from the difficulty of isolating this virus, and the four studies [15, 16, 27, 28] (three of which were from the same group) with the highest rhinovirus rates, also had high overall identification rates. In three studies [37, 43, 44] with high overall rates but low rhinovirus rates, RSV and parainfluenza viruses were the predominant organisms. This might be due to different expertise with different viruses in the individual laboratories, or it might reflect the phenomenon of interference, whereby high or epidemic infection rates of one virus result in lower infection rates with other viruses [44] (as with parainfluenza type 1 and 2 infections which alternate in predominance from year to year). Identification rates for other viruses, were, with a few exceptions, lower and less variable between studies.

Again rhinovirus identification was the most variable between studies and the study with the lowest overall rate [17] (14 3%) had a low rate of rhinoviruses identified although rhinoviruses were the predominant organisms. From the description given of the virology [48] it does not appear that this low rate was due to inadequate methods, but again a slightly higher rate (17%) was reported from specimens taken within 48 hr of symptom onset. Two studies with high overall isolation rate [23, 24] did not attempt to identify rhinoviruses at all. Both of these studies involved very close monitoring of the children by physicians who kept daily records. In one [24] , the children were observed in hospital over a period of months: RSV, parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses were predominant. In the other [23] (which in spite of using only serology had the highest overall identification rate) children were in an Alpine asthma resort over a period of months and had daily physician examinations and spirometry: influenza viruses accounted for the majority of identifications. These studies serve to emphasize that intense observation and early investigation are important and productive in identifying viruses.

The study of Huhti et al. [47] looked only at hospital admissions and some subjects lived at a great distance from the investigation centre, in addition only serology was used. In the other two studies, methods appear to have been adequate. Adults have a lower incidence of upper respiratory infection than children [49] , and this might mean that viruses are a less important trigger of asthma than in children. However, there is a paucity of data in adults and further studies are required to confirm this. Two studies in adults have been deliberately omitted from the list. In a study of 111 exacerbations of asthma in 51 adults over 18 months, Clarke [50] isolated viruses in only four exacerbations and found seroconversions in another four, and concluded that respiratory infection was not contributory to asthma exacerbations. However, culture specimens were only obtained in 27 exacerbations, and paired sera in 102. Weighting by these figures gives an estimated overall identification rate of 18 7% [(4/27)-I-(4/102)]. Tarlo et al. [51] followed 19 asthmatics and their normal spouses over 12 months, and stated that less than 10% of exacerbations were associated with respiratory infection; however, the actual viral identification rate during episodes is diflicult to obtain from the data presented. In the three studies shown in the table, there was little difl\"erence in average rates of identifying rhinoviruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which were in general lower than for the same viruses in children; this was particularly so for rhinoviruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 136, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 761, "end": 765, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1151, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus identification rates in exacerbations of asthma and wheezing (Table 2)"}, {"text": "In overview these studies demonstrate some common features. All of the respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been associated with asthma exacerbations, including herpes simplex virus, although it is hard to know whether this is solely an oral/perioral contami-\u2022nant. Owing to technical difficulties (which have been acknowledged by authors of all of the above studies), there is great variability in the identification of rhinoviruses and few studies have looked at coronavirus, although these are the two predominant viral species in the common cold [49] , Several studies have implicated two different organisms in the same episode on a few occasions: in the majority of cases this is due to seroconversion to two viruses, or simultaneously with culture of another virus, and rarely due to culture of two organisms [24] , None of the studies has a 'full house' of organisms, again emphasizing individual, seasonal and laboratory variation, and the difficulties of identifying viruses. The frequency of different viruses corresponds broadly to the frequency of the viruses in respiratory illness in the age group studied [16] , However, when hospital admissions for respiratory illness without wheeze are considered, rhinoviruses are less commonly found, and RSV more commonly found, than in acute asthma [19, 43] , This does not mean that rhinoviruses are not an important cause of hospitalization [52] , but that severe lower respiratory disease due to rhinoviruses commonly consists of exacerbation of asthma rather than other pathological conditions. The same may be true of coronaviruses, but little information exists. (Table 3) The proportions of subjects who wheeze with an identified respiratory virus have been listed in studies informative in this regard in Table 3 , Studies which were not informative were those where investigations were only performed during episodes of wheezing. The table is again divided into incidental studies, where the denominator for the per cent wheezing is all episodes of respiratory tract infection positive to any or specific viruses in extended cross-sectional studies of children, and prospective studies (five in children and one in adults), where the denominator is the number of virus-positive episodes of RTI in asthmatic subjects followed for varying periods.

The authors defined this as at least three of the signs of ',, , wheezing, expiratory stridor, respiratory chest recessions, rapid respiration rate and audible rales, rhonchi and sibilating rhonchi, ,,', This may have been a broader numerator than in the other studies. In most of the studies, influenza viruses gave generally lower rates of wheezing than the other viruses, which is somewhat paradoxical, considering that this virus is the one most often characterized by infection of the lower respiratory tract in the general population. This might add strength to the argument (discussed in more detail in the second article in this series) that the wheezing arises as an indirect effect of upper respiratory infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 493, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 244, "text": "(Fig, 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Rates of wheezing/asthma in viral respiratory infections"}, {"text": "In the prospective studies of asthmatics, overall wheezing rates were generally higher, as would be expected, and were very consistent at 50-60%, including the single informative study of adults.

However, it is not clear whether they are more susceptible to respiratory infection than those without asthma, or whether they manifest infection more obviously with the development of wheezing or coughing, making subclinical infection less likely. Minor et al. [26] found a greater incidence of identifiable viral infections in asthmatic children compared to their non-asthmatic siblings, attributable mostly to an excess of rhinovirus infections. On the other hand, Horn and Gregg [56] found a higher overall incidence of symptoms among asthmatic children with rhinovirus infection than occurred with rhinovirus infection in other groups, including the group defined as having recurrent 'wheezy bronchitis'. In addition, among asthmatics with rhinovirus infection, bronchitis with wheeze was the most common condition, whereas among other groups pure upper respiratory symptoms were predominant. With parainfluenza virus infection the results were more vari- able, and with RSV, the overall incidence of symptoms was lowest in asthmatics, and highest in those children with no history of respiratory illness, although asthmatics exhibited a higher rate of wheeze, Roldaan and Masural [23] found that an asthma exacerbation occurred in six of 21 episodes of seroconversion (three influenza, two parainfluenza type 3, one adenovirus) with mild or absent upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the asthma may have been the only manifestation of the viral infection in these six episodes. In a study of 30 preschool children presenting with recurrent respiratory infection, Isaacs et al. [57] found that in comparison to a control group of children, the index children had both a higher rate of viral infections and a higher incidence of lower respiratory disease (predominantly wheeze), during proven viral infections. Thus both mechanisms may be contributory: asthmatic children may get more virus infections and more obvious lower respiratory tract symptoms during them, than other children. The situation is less clear in adults with asthma, among whom, again, there is little data regarding viral infections, Tarlo et al. [51] found that asthmatic adults reported more symptomatic respiratory infections than their non-asthmatic spouses, but had a lower viral identiflcation rate, Beasley et al.
