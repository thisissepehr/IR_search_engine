An important observation during the recent H7N9 outbreak in China was the wide variation in host response to infections, with some patients developing only mild upper respiratory tract infections, while other patients developed severe ARDS and died. Although several determinants of the host response to infection have been identified, many important genetic factors that dampen or exacerbate the host response to H7N9 infection likely remain undiscovered. Previous studies suggested that genetic mutations in the protein machinery that comprise key host defense mechanisms could impact outcomes of influenza infection 12 . The differential susceptibilities to influenza A(H7N9) were affected by functional variants of LGALS1 causing the expression variations 13 . The H7N9 influenza outbreak in China provides an unique opportunity to study mutations in this machinery, because many poultry workers were exposed to the virus, yet comparatively 14 . Mutations in these genes may lead to increased host susceptibility to infection or to a heightened, and potentially deleterious, host response to infection. We hypothesized that the exome sequencing of these patients may reveal genetic mutations that increased susceptibility to viral infection, and that in the future, these mutations could provide information regarding risk of infection, especially poultry workers or family members of infected patients. Using a variety of computational genetic techniques, we identified 21 genes that showed a high rate of mutation in patients infected with H7N9 when compared to the general population. Among these genes, some have been identified in prior studies of H7N9 susceptibility genes 14 . For example, Wang et al. reported that IFITM3 dysfunction is associated with increased cytokine production during H7N9 infection and is correlated with mortality 14 . IFITM3 (chr11, 320772, A > G) was reported to be enriched in patients hospitalized due to H1N1/09 infection 15 .

Four disease outcome-associated SNPs were identified on chromosomes 17 (RPAIN and C1QBP), chromosome 1 (FCGR2A), and chromosome 3 (unknown gene).
