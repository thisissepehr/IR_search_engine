We evaluated characteristics of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak to elucidate lessons learned for managing transnational public health security threats. Methods: We used publically available data to compare demographic and outbreak-specific data for Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, including key indicator data by the World Health Organization. Pearson correlation statistics were calculated to compare country-level infrastructure characteristics with outbreak size and duration. Results: Hospital bed density was inversely correlated with longer EVD outbreak duration (r = \u2212 0.99). Country-specific funding amount allocations were more likely associated with number of incident cases than the population at-risk or infrastructure needs. Key indicators demonstrating challenges for Guinea included: number of unsafe burials, percent of EVD-positive samples, and days between symptom onset and case hospitalization. Sierra Leone's primary key indicator was the number of districts with \u22651 security incident. Liberia controlled their outbreak before much of the key-indicator data were collected.

Underscoring its severity, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak was larger than all previous EVD outbreaks combined. The epidemic began in December 2013 and the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified on March 23, 2014. The WHO declared it a public health emergency of international concern on August 8, 2014 [6] . Further demonstrating the security threat posed by this public health emergency, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2176 (2014) adopted on September 15, 2014 declared the outbreak was \"a threat to international peace and security in the region\" [7] . The international community's response acting in cooperation with the immediately affected countries included diagnosing the disease as early as possible, contact tracing, patient isolation and care, infection control, ring vaccination, safe burial practices, and public education (e.g., messages on billboards and radio describing symptoms, hand hygiene, school closures, and avoiding close contact to prevent transmission). Indeed, many of these factors comprise the majority of the WHO Ebola Situation Reports' key performance indicators [8] . The outbreak officially ended on March 29, 2016 . Ten countries were directly impacted, three of which experienced significant outbreaks (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), while seven countries reported one or more EVD cases without widespread human-to-human transmission (Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the UK, and the US) [9, 10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 265, "end": 268, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 269, "end": 272, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 601, "end": 604, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 864, "end": 867, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1414, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1464, "text": "March 29, 2016", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1753, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1757, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "We aim to systematically examine country-specific factors within the context of the larger global pandemicwith the greatest emphasis on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

Perhaps the most substantial of which is the difficulty to quantify many factors affecting control of the outbreak. For example, the West African people educated their communities, facilitating the change of social practices, such as greetings with physical contact and modifying long-standing traditional burial practices [31, 37] . Education messages on fighting the epidemic were communicated through messaging in radio, billboards, etc.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak devastated three West African countries and propagated to seven additional countries on three continents. The public health response and subsequent control of the outbreak was different across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The results from both the analysis of country-level data and the qualitative analysis generate hypotheses that inadequate infrastructure at the country level contributed to the delayed control of EVD within the affected countries and contributed to lower survival rates. This Ebola epidemic, as many in the past (such as HIV, West Nile virus, SARS, and cholera in Haiti), shows us that epidemics can have a devastating global impact, and therefore should be considered everyone's problem. The recent Zika virus epidemic followed many similar patterns highlighting that we all share the responsibility in responding to infectious outbreaks. Many of the country-level factors, particularly the WHO key indicators were associated with controlling the epidemic.
