The humanized construct of IgE isotype was generated for the first time. Genes of the recombinant antibodies were cloned into the pCl-neo vector under the control of universal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Transfected HEK-293 cells efficiently produced antibodies of the corresponding isotypes IgE and IgG1. The results of Western blotting confirmed homogeneity of the expressed antibodies, which had the predicted molecular weight and specifically interacted with the HER-2/neu. The attachment of leader peptide to the 5'-end of the gene resulted in the preferential accumulation of recombinant antibodies in the cultural medium. These results indicate that de novo constructed humanized immunoglobulin genes express functionally active, singlechain recombinant antibodies in eukaryotic cells.",

To be clinically applicable, these antibodies must meet several requirements, including high affinity to the target, low immunogenicity and high selectivity of binding.

Previously, we have analyzed the expression of the chimeric IgE gene in different mouse tissues using ballistic transfection [10] . The Humanized single-chain tandem VL-VH (ScFv fragment 4D5) [11, 12] capable of HER-2/neu receptor recognition was used to generate the expression constructs. The tandem was linked to human IgE or IgG constant genes through the linker peptideencoding oligonucleotide.
