Bisphosphonatesrelated osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) is a recently (last decade) described adverse side effect of bisphosphonate therapy. 2 Patients who are receiving intravenous, nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis, multiple myeloma or metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ). These patients represent 94% of published cases. 2 The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. 2 The BRONJ has been defined as \"a condition characterized by exposure of bone in the mandible or maxilla persisting for more than 8 weeks in a patient who has taken or currently is taking a bisphosphonate and who has no history of radiation therapy to the jaws.\" 3 It presents with halitosis, pain and neuropathy, and erythema and suppuration. Clinically, the disease is characterized by exposed alveolar bone that occurs spontaneously or becomes evident following an invasive dental surgical procedure such as tooth extraction, periodontal surgery, apicoectomy, or dental implant placement. 4, 5 In 2003, several cases of ONJ were reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. [5] [6] [7] Since then, the number of reported cases has been increased, and the literature now includes several hundreds of cases. 3 Bisphosphonate-associated ONJ ( Figure 1 ) usually appears as areas of necrotic exposed bone surrounded by inflamed gingiva or mucosa. 8 It usually has a significant adverse effect on the quality of life for most patients. [9] [10] [11] Complete prevention of this complication is not currently possible. However, pre-therapy dental care reduces this incidence, and nonsurgical dental procedures can prevent new cases. 12 Several recommendations have been proposed for treating ONJ, but no consensus on a standard of care has been reached, nor is there any agreement on a surgical versus nonsurgical approach to therapy. 3, [11] [12] [13] [14] This probably results from the lack of reported randomized clinical trials comparing different management strategies designed to allow the area of exposed bone to recover. 3 Montebugnoli et al. 3 evaluated the efficacy of two different procedures for treating patients with ONJ and adopted an objective parameter to quantify the efficacy of each protocol. The preliminary results of such a study did not show any significant difference between surgical and nonsurgical approaches and suggested that an antibiotic regimen was effective in the short-term management of these patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 152, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 349, "end": 350, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 621, "end": 622, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 754, "end": 755, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1019, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1349, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1351, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1445, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1449, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1453, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1575, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1712, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1802, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1807, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1812, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 1997, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2197, "end": 2199, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2200, "end": 2204, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2209, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2214, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2219, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2393, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2415, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1608, "end": 1616, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To date, such clinical trials entail objective difficulties to a scientific approach, that is, randomizing groups of oncology patients whose quality of life is strictly related to bisphosphonate drugs.

Bisphosphonate-related ONJ is a well-documented side effect of the therapy. 16 Ethical considerations prevent analyzing these agents in randomized trials. Numerous clinical protocols have been proposed for treating such lesion. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the best protocol for treating the areas of exposed bone. 3, 11, 13, 14 Eckert et al. 17 used surgery and antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) to treat 21 patients with bisphosphonate-associated ONJ and found that the clinical symptoms of osteonecrosis recurred in 10 cases (47.6%) after primary treatment. On the other hand, our results showed a remarkable decrease in the size of exposed bone areas during the nonsurgical therapy from a mean 25 to 4.25 mm (12.5 \u00b1 12.0 mm to 8.8 \u00b1 10.3 mm, F = 16.1; p < .01; r 2 = .95), and showed also complete resolution of the disease in some patients. There is also no recurrence, although we used a minimally invasive nonsurgical regimen suggested by Moretti et al. 15 This might be explained 12 on the basis that bisphosphonates are highly concentrated in the jaws. Coupled with chronic invasive dental diseases and treatments and the thin mucosa over bone, the small capillaries within the bone become involuted, and the bone becomes avascular. A spontaneous breakdown of the overlying mucosa, some form of injury, or an invasive surgery to the jaws usually causes this necrotic bone to become exposed which then fails to heal. Ficarra et al. 18 were the first to suggest antibiotic treatment associated with hygiene protocol, and the value of this therapy has been supported by more recent articles. 19, 20 These actually coincide with our results in using limited minimally invasive nonsurgical protocol, whereas extensive radical surgical resection rarely results in wound closure and sometimes contributes to worsening of the disease. 21 More precisely, debridement of the affected area and covering the exposed bone with soft tissue flaps or bone-contouring procedures has often proven to be risky, leading to more exposed bone, worsening of the symptoms, and increased risk for a pathologic fracture of the jaw. This can be explained on the basis that the uncertain outcomes of surgical treatment probably stem from the ability of bisphosphonates to bind hydroxyapatite and thus to be absorbed by bone, making it impossible to surgically remove the necrotic bone to a safe margin. 12 In addition, surgery may create a bone wound that will not heal, because of the bisphosphonate therapy itself; secondary osteonecrosis may then develop from the surgical margins. 15 In such cases, the postsurgical relapse of the pathology can create greater bone exposure and a worsening of the condition. The intrinsic risks associated with these surgical procedures, which are typically performed in patients who are already compromised by their oncologic pathology, should persuade physicians to limit surgical intervention to only those cases that are refractory to conservative management.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 139, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 386, "end": 388, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 389, "end": 392, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 397, "end": 399, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 414, "end": 416, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1042, "text": "Moretti et al. 15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1521, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1680, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1683, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1917, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2465, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2647, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The use of antibiotics is justified because bacteria play an important role in developing and maintaining the osteonecrotic process. 22, 23 Bacterial cofactors appear to be directly involved in the maintenance and development of the necrotic lesions, and these factors may also be responsible for significant inhibition of epithelial regeneration over the exposed bone. 21, 24 Therefore, the present prospective longitudinal study evaluated the effectiveness of a minimally invasive hygiene protocol in a larger group of patients for a longer period of time, restricting antibiotic therapy to the acute phase, to determine whether this approach allowed long-term control of both necrotic bone and patient discomfort. It is important to note that the size of the necrotic area is not a healing parameter, because it is strictly associated with other factors, such as soft tissue shrinkage due to the control of infection and inflammation.
