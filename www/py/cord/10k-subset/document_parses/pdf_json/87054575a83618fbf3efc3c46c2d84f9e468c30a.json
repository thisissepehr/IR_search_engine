But now, it's widely accepted that lung has a remarkable reparative capacity [1] [2] [3] . When the epithelial cells lining the interior of the lung are damaged by infection with influenza virus, a rare stem-cell population distal airway stem cells (DASCs) is induced to proliferate and migrate to the damaged site. They can differentiate into alveolar epithelium type 1 and type 2 cells (AEC1/2 s) [4] . Bronchioalveolar stem cell (BASCs) is a regional pulmonary stem cell population, identified at the bronchioalveolar duct junction [5] . It is resistant to bronchiolar and alveolar damage and proliferate during epithelial cell renewal in vivo [6] . Vaughan et al proposed a lineage-negative epithelial progenitor (LNEP) as the major source of induced Krt5+ cells and it mobilize to regenerate lung epithelium after major injury [7] . Using a microfluidic magnetic activated cell sorting system, our previous study has isolated mouse lung multipotent stem cells (MLSCs) which play an important role in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells injury repair [8] . To our interest, BASCs, DASCs, LNEP and MLSCs are all rare stem cells which play their role in regeneration through differentiation into lung progenitor cells, especially AEC2s.",

During development, AEC1s and AEC2s arise from a bipotent progenitor cell lineage, whereas after birth, AEC2s can undergo long-term self-renewal and give rise to AEC1s during homeostasis [9, 10] . But the mechanisms that regulate AEC2 renewal are incompletely understood. More recently, genetic lineage tracing experiments showed evidence that AEC2s were capable of long-term self-renewal and the generation of AEC1 in both alveolar regeneration and homeostasis. Therefore AEC2s are stem cells, as a population, proliferate in vivo and give rise to AEC1s [11, 12] .",

They remain significant contributing factors to morbidity in the traumatically injured patient. Survivors of ARDS often have a lower functional ability and lower than normal health related quality of life [13] . During the course of ALI, multi-factors such as the activation of inflammatory cells and release of inflammatory factors lead to damage of air-blood barrier (ABB). However, present treatments such as infection control and mechanical ventilation are supportive therapies, promoting the regeneration of lung itself maybe an ideal therapy. In this study, we established a hemorrhagic shock and LPS lung injury model. Using this model, we analyzed the cellular kinetics of lung alveolar epithelial cells. In terms of mechanism research, we explored the role of HGF/c-Met signaling pathway in AEC2s proliferation after ALI. Accordingly, we first examined the proliferation of AEC2s, expression of HGF after ALI, and phosphorylation of c-Met following ALI in rat lung. Western blotting using the c-Met inhibitor SU11274 provided further evidence for the involvement of HGF/c-Met signaling in ALI-induced AEC2s proliferation.",

To gain high purity of AEC2s, collect T1\u03b1-negative cells, incubated with mouse anti-rat EpCAM antibodies (Abcam, USA) for 40 min at 4\u00b0C, and then handle cells as above with rat anti-mouse MicroBead solution.

In our study, to determine whether acute lung injury affected the biological behavior of AEC2s, their number was quantitatively analyzed at various time points after ALI. Although significant AEC1s loss were observed by 48 h after ALI, the number of AEC2s did not significantly decrease at any time point. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that there was a significant increase of proliferated AEC2s in alveolar on day 2 and day 3 ( Fig. 2a and d) . Consistent with IF, FACS analysis showed that the abundance of AEC2s did not change during day 5 and day 7 (Fig. 1e) . The result of HE staining also shows that alveolar walls are lined with cuboidal epithelial cells which are proliferating AEC2s on day 2 and day 3. On day 5 and 7, the structure of alveolar wall recovered. These results proved that AEC2s are damage resistant during acute lung injury, and they might be the main cell involved in lung injury and repair.",

The 3rd day after ALI's LTH can promote the significant higher expression of p-c-Met, *p = 0.018. d The effect of the 3rd day after ALI's LTH on the proliferation of AEC2's in vitro. AEC2's had an increased proliferation rate when co-cultured with the 3rd day after ALI's LTH (100ug/ml, 48 h). When co-cultured with SU11274, the proliferation rate of AEC2s co-cultured with the 3rd day after ALI's LTH was inhibited (left). The quantitative analysis of AEC2 proliferation with or without SU11274 (right), *P = 0.004 expression of p-c-Met was not due to the high expression of total c-Met. SU11274 is a selective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET receptor tyrosine kinase, it reduced the 3rd day ALI's Lung tissue homogenates-increased AEC2s cell proliferation significantly (P = 0.004) (Fig. 3e) . Other important tyrosine kinase pathways (AKT and MAPK) had been detected, but there was no difference when treated with the 3rd day ALI's Lung tissue homogenates (Fig. 3d) .",

Furthermore, new evidence shows that the same SPC+ cells can maintain the AEC2 population over the long term, an important criterion for defining the population as containing stem cells. In the unperturbed lung, lineage-labeled AEC2s give rise to only small clones of daughter cells, and there is a low rate of differentiation into AEC1s [19] . But there is hardly any study examined the cellular kinetics of AEC1s and AEC2s post acute lung injury systematicly. Using the hemorrhagic shock and LPS lung injury rat model, we found that the number of AEC1s began to decline on the 1st day and declined to a bottom on the 3rd day post injury, then gradually returned to a normal level. The kinetics of AEC2s was different to AEC1s, a significant increase in AEC2s number was detected on the 3rd day, followed by a further increase from the 5th day to 7th day, then AEC2 numbers gradually returned to normal. Doubleimmunofluorescence staining for pro-SPC and PCNA showed that the percentage of proliferated AEC2s was significantly increased on the 3rd day. After a period of active lung repair, AEC2 numbers dropped to baseline levels by day 7. It means that AEC2 significantly proliferated after acute lung injury. They are injury resistant cells in acute lung injury and may have important roles in the regeneration of damaged lung.",

Similarly, the effectiveness of stem cell therapy to ameliorate tissue damage could likely be optimized if the specific damage niche was well characterized. After acute lung injury, the milieu of the damaged tissue will determine the rate and nature of alveolar epithelial repair and is therefore of great interest. We speculate that the milieu of acute lung injury can promote the proliferation of AEC2s due to the cytokines released so we observed whether the milieu of acute lung injury had biological effect on AEC2s. The cytokine release of the lung homogenate was investigated. HGF was the only cytokine significantly elevated on the 2nd and 3rd day after acute lung injury. It can significantly accelerate AEC2 cell cycle in vitro, indicating that the proliferation of AEC2 after acute lung injury may be induced by the elevated HGF.",

It is produced following HCl-or bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and plays a role in pulmonary epithelial cell regeneration [22, 23] . Studies have also demonstrated that HGF is responsible for most growth-promoting activity for AEC2s cells, compared with EGF, TGF-a, acidic fibroblast growth factor, and keratinocyte growth factor [24] . All biological effects of HGF are mediated by a single tyrosine kinase receptor (c-Met), which is mainly expressed in cells with an epithelial or endothelial origin [24, 25] . Incubation with HGF results in the activation of c-Met and increase of proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma cells and isolated type II cells and stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in lung adenocarcinoma cells [26] . To clearly establish the relationship between HGF/c-Met activation and AEC2 proliferation, we observed the key proteins' expression. We found that the 3rd day's milieu of ALI can promote significant higher expression of p-c-Met while there is no difference of the expression of total c-Met. The Met kinase inhibitor SU11274 significantly reduced 3rd day's damaged Lung tissue homogenates-increased AEC2s cell proliferation. Furthermore, we verified the role of c-Met in the proliferation of AEC2s in vivo by treated of c-Met inhibitor SU11274.

The survival rate of ALI rat of four intratracheal injection LPS concentrations (lower). b The hematoxylin and eosin stain of lungs after acute lung injury (200\u00d7). Most alveolar walls were fractured on the first day post injury (D1). On day 2 and 3, alveolar spaces were filled with a mixed neutrophilic and monocytic infiltrate, alveolar wall capillaries were congested. Alveolar hemorrhage was visible. Alveolar walls were lined with cuboidal epithelial cells which were proliferating AEC2s. On days 5 and 7, the formation of alveolar wall was recovered. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm. c Immunofluorescence analysis of AEC1s in the rat lung after acute lung injury. Immunostaining for AQP5 (green) was performed on lung tissue from Normal (N), D1 (Day 1), D2 (Day 2), D3 (Day 3), D5 (Day 5) and D7 (Day7) days after injury. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm. d The immunofluorescence analysis of AEC2s in rat lung after ALI. Immunostaining for pro-SPC (green) was performed on lung tissue from days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 after ALI. Arrowhead indicates proSPC positive AEC2s. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm. e The cellular kinetics of AEC1s after ALI (The dose of LPS is 4.5 mg/kg in ALI rat model). Rat lung cell suspensions were incubation with anti-AQP5 antibody, the percentage of AQP5 positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry analysis (left). *P = 0.026 (compared with sham group). The variance of percentage of covering surface of AEC1s after ALI (analyzed by Image J, Version 1.2). *P < 0.05 (compared with normal control) (middle). The flow cytometry analysis of AEC2s after acute lung injury. The rat whole lung cell suspensions were incubation with anti-proSPC antibody, the percentage of proSPC positive cells was analyzed. *P = 0.012 (right)",
