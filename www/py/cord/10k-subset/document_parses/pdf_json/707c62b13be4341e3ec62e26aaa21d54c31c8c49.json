It has been shown that edema is cleared primarily by active Na + transport with water following the Na + movement [2, 3] . Na + enters the cells via apical Na + channels and exits via the basolateral Na,K-ATPases ( Fig. 1) [4, 5, 6] . Na,K-ATPases are transmembrane proteins consisting of a and b subunits. The a subunit binds and cleaves the high energy phosphate bond of ATP, whereas the b subunit is apparently responsible for the assembly and normal function of the enzyme complex in the plasma membrane [7, 8] . Na,K-ATPases are ubiquitous in all mammalian cells and can be found in the lung in both alveolar epithelial type I and II cells (ATI, ATII). Na,K-ATPase works in coordination with the apical Na + channel to generate an electrochemical gradient which results in a vectorial Na + flux from the airspace and subsequent isosmotic movement of water from the airspaces [5, 6] .",

The addition of DA increased clearance by 50 % in the RA rats and by approximately 250 % in hyperoxic rats. Ouabain blocked the effect of DA in both hyperoxic and RA control rats, as did colchicine but not b-lumicolchicine. Na, K-ATPase a1subunit abundance was determined by Western blot of the basolateral membrane of isolated ATII cells after incubation with DA. DA increased the subunit abundance in the control and b-lumicolchicine treated ATII cells. Colchicine inhibited the increase of the subunit, presumably by disruption of the microtubular transport system. The investigators hypothesized that lung edema clearance could be enhanced by increasing the abundance of available Na,K-ATPase via adenoviral transfer of the Na,K-ATPase b-1 subunit gene. A shuttle vector was constructed containing either the a-1 or b-1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase, or neither (null). The adenovirus was constructed using a plasmid containing a human type 5 adenovirus genome cotransfected with the shuttle vec-tor into human embryonic kidney cells. Rat ATII cells and airway epithelial cells were isolated and infected. Rats were sedated and underwent alveolar instillation of either (1) adenovirus with surfactant, (2) null adenovirus, (3) adenovirus with galactosidase, (4) adenovirus with b-1 subunit or (5) adenovirus with a-1 subunit. The rats were killed after 1 week.",

When ouabain (an inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase) was added to the perfusate of the adenovirus b-1 animals, clearance decreased by 75 %. AQP knockout mice were used to investigate the role of aquaporins in fluid transport between airspace, interstitium and capillary in the lungs. Control mice were (+ / +), AQP1 mice where heterozygous (+ /-) or homozygous deficient (-/-), AQP4 mice were homozygous deficient (-/-). (Immunoblot showed decreased AQP1 levels to about 40 % in + /-animals and 0 % in AQP1 or AQP4-/-). Osmotically driven water movement between airspace and capillary was measured by filling the airspace with a solution containing a membrane impermeable fluorescent indicator (FITC-dextran). Pulmonary artery (PA) perfusate osmolality was altered resulting in water movement into or out of the airspace and a change in the FITC concentration. Quantitative measurements of the time course of change in fluorescence intensity were used to calculate osmotic water permeability of the airspace-capillary barrier (Pf). Results were a t 1/2 of approximately 12 s in AQP + / + mice, 36 s in AQP1 + /-, and 75 s in AQP1 -/-. Pf was 17 2 cm/sec in + / + mice, 6.6 0.06 in AQP1 + /-mice, 1.7 0.03 in AQP1 -/mice, and 12 1 in AQP4 -/-. To confirm reduced microvascular water permeability in AQP1 -/-mice, perfluorocarbon was instilled in the airspace and the PA was perfused with varying osmolalities of FITC-dextran. In + / + mice, increase in perfusate osmolality resulted in movement of fluid into the vascular compartment and decreased fluorescence. The amplitude of the change in fluorescence signal relates to microvascular osmotic water permeability and was reduced in AQP1 -/-mice.",

Several studies have suggested that recent improvements in outcome are related to improved fluid and ventilator management. As our understanding of the molecular mediators of the pathophysiology improves, new therapeutic avenues will evolve. A growing insight into the mechanism of edema clearance at the molecular level is an example. We now recognize that such clinically relevant injury as ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) and hyperoxic lung injury are compounded by substantial reduction in lung ability to clear edema at a time when clearance is imperative. The decrease in edema clearance in VALI is paralleled by a decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity, suggesting a possible cause-effect relationship.",

Apparently, catecholamines and DA instilled into the airspace, or perfused into the pulmonary circulation, restore the lung's ability to clear edema in hyperoxic injury. In fact, the DA effect was greatest in the injured lung. Inhibition of DA's effect by colchicine, but not b-lumicolchicine, suggests that upregulation is achieved by recruitment of preformed ion-transporting proteins, such as Na,K-ATPase, from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the rapid time frame in which upregulation occurs is inconsistent with transcription and translation of new protein. Available data now confirm that isoproterenol also increases Na,K-ATPase activity by insertion of increased numbers of a subunits, recruited from late endosomes, into the plasma membrane [20] .",

Experimental models have added DA, or other catecholamines, directly into the airspace or the perfusate. Another route may be gene therapy. Efficient gene transfer of b-1 subunits into ATII cells can be achieved with newer, replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vectors. Increased Na,K-ATPase function after b-1 subunit gene transfer demonstrates that Na,K-ATPase activity in ATII cells can be augmented, resulting in increased vectorial transport of Na + and increased clearance. The time course for viral transfection may prohibit its use in the acute setting, however it may have clinical implications for therapy of more long-term volume overload states, such as congestive heart failure. Prior to clinical application of gene therapy, the safety of recombinant adenoviruses needs to be established, especially in regard to their potential to induce lung inflammation.",
