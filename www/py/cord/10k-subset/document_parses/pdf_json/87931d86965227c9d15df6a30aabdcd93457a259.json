Radionuclides, above published exemption amounts, fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CNSC. The CNSC issues licenses for the manufacture, acquisition, and use of radionuclides and the standards are uniformly applied across the country. The situation is different for x-ray-emitting devices with energies below 1 MeV. Federal agencies authorize the sale, lease, and importation of x-ray devices, but it is the jurisdiction of the Provinces and Territories to regulate the installation and use of medical x-ray imaging equipment. Consequently, permitted uses, occupational dose constraints and limits, and shielding design of x-ray facilities vary across the country. As many jurisdictions are attempting to reduce the legislative burden of radiation safety regulations, the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists (COMP) conducted a survey in 2016/ 2017 to provide a useful snapshot of existing variations in rules and methodologies for human patient medical imaging facilities in order to assist jurisdictions to harmonize approaches.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "also use BIR2000 and BIR2012 which also provide information on dental, BMD, SPECT/CT, and PET/CT installations.

The dose constraint is often chosen as a level of dose and do not apply to medical diagnosis or treatment. Diagnostic reference levels are similar to dose constraints, but are intended for medical exposure situations. An example of a dose constraint is shielding adjacent spaces of an x-ray room to planned occupational dose levels.

A dose limit is used for the occupational exposure of individuals, and is a limit of exposure from all occupational sources. Two examples of dose limits are full body exposure limits for radiation workers and eye exposure limits mostly of concern in fluoroscopy guided interventional (FGI) procedures.

Safety Code (SC) 20A 13 was first published in 1976. Safety Code 20A was mainly concerned with safety procedures for the installation, use, and control of x-ray equipment. It had limited sections on the x-ray output parameters. Only film processor quality control was defined in any detail. Safety Code 35 (2008) 14 is a vast improvement on the former Code, and COMP endorses the provincial and territorial adoption of this code into jurisdictional regulations and accreditation agencies. 15 Safety Code 35 includes comprehensive safety requirements for the installation, use, and control of all x-ray equipment (except mammography equipment covered in SC 36, 16 dentistry equipment covered in SC 30, 17 and bone mineral density equipment). There is increased emphasis on patient dose and much of SC 35 is concerned with quality control (QC) of digital imaging systems. Unfortunately, although SC 35 explicitly states that radiation shielding should be designed using the methods of NCRP 147, an Appendix has a summary of NCRP 49 which was retained from SC20A at the request of some provincial radiation protection authorities for their reference.3 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 3.A | How the survey was conducted The Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists endeavored to capture existing rules and methodologies for human patient medical imaging facilities.

The vast majority of workers receive exposure to a group of badges, and again, the investigators might not correct the National Dose Registry records if not doing so has no repercussions to the site or staff member.An interesting discovery arising from the author correspondence for this work is that some facilities issue a single badge to FGI staff that is to be worn on top of the apron, which is common practice in the United States 23,24 but uncommon in Canada and not the practice suggested by SC35.14 The ICRP recommends two dosimeters be worn-one above the apron at neck level and one under the protective apron for FGI work.25 The NCRP recommends both practices but does not recommend a single dosimeter under the apron for FGI work.24 For one set of facilities in Canada where they issue a single badge to FGI workers to be worn on top of the apron, we confirmed that from 2008 to 2016, the collar badge readings are being reported as whole-body readings (occupational dose) with the National Dose Registry. Such practice can routinely result in badge readings exceeding 20 mSv while the true occupational dose is a fraction of this. We verified that at least some of the high \"occupational dose\" readings inFig. 2are not representative of actual occupational dose received by radiography workers.Another interesting finding is that badging practices vary across Canada. Many jurisdictions require all general duty x-ray staff to wear a badge in order to demonstrate their workplace exposure does not exceed regulatory limits. In some jurisdictions, since the aforementioned approach showed these staff always received less workplace exposure than what is allowed for the general public(1 mSv/yr), not all staff are routinely badged. A single or handful of full time employees wear dosimeters in order to ensure compliance with dose limits, whereas the rest of the staff wears the dosimeter for the first 6 months and if their workplace exposure is well below 1 mSv/yr they are no longer issued a dosimeter unless the staff member requests it. In such jurisdictions staff working in FGI work still wear dosimeters as do general duty pregnant staff. Box plot distributions of average occupational dose from 1990 to 2016 by province/territory are shown in Fig. 3, and all median values for each year were reported as zero. However, the true value is more accurately reported as <0.1 mSv, since the minimum reporting values for different badge technologies is 0.1 and 0.01 mSv, and measurements less than these values are reported as zero to Canada's National Dosimetry Registry. At the time of writing, Newfoundland and Labrador is presently reviewing their radiation safety legislations and the supporting regulations, whereas Ontario and Manitoba are in the final stages of their processes. Ontario's higher shielding specifications are based on SC 20A which follows NCRP49 requirements, and Pesianian et al have shown thicker Pb would be specified for shielding designs based on NCRP49 when compared to NCRP147 10 at greater economic expense. In Newfoundland and Labrador, while not specified in the current regulations, the Minister is referencing Safety Code 35 for inspection standards and exposure limits.
