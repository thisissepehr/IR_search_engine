Viruses are now used to study gene expression and receptor-ligand interactions and to express cloned genes in eukaryotic systems. It has nevertheless remained easier to study viral infections in vitro rather than viral-host interactions in whole organisms. Recently a number of significant insights into the molecular and genetic basis for the pathogenesis of viral infections of the nervous system have been reported by different groups. In this review we will highlight some of the major findings in the field. Viral pathogenesis is the process by which a virus causes disease in a susceptible host. Pathogenesis can be analyzed in terms of a series of stages (see 132) and 154) for reviews). To cause systemic illness, a virus must first enter the host animal, undergo primary replication at a site near its portal of entry, and then ultimately spread to distant target tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS).",

An infecting animal virus faces two main blocks to penetration of the CNS or any other specific target organ: (1) a variety of barriers prevent the free access of viruses to target cells, and (2) even when these barriers are ineffective, only certain cell types will support the internalization and replication of a particular virus. It is useful to think of the capacity of a virus to establish a lethal infection within the CNS as the property of neumirulence and the ability to penetrate the CNS after inoculation and growth at a peripheral site as the property of neuroinvasiveness. Experimentally, it is easy to bypass the barriers to CNS infection (by intracerebral inoculation, for example), and therefore each of these properties can be tested for independently. A major goal of much of the current work in virology has been the correlation of viral properties such as neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness with specific viral genes or proteins or, when the systems have been more advanced, with specific regions of these genes andor proteins.",

Many other neurotropic viruses enter the host via natural portals such as the respiratory and GI tracts. Entry via these routes may be direct (via contaminated saliva, for example) or through aerosols. The molecular mechanisms that influence the capacity of viruses to become aerosolized and their subsequent stability are unknown. Most nonenveloped viruses (poliovirus, reovirus) appear to lose infectivity in conditions of low (< 50%,) relative humidity. For example, aerosolized poliovirus shows a lo3-fold drop in infectivity when kept for 1 hour at 15 % relative humidity (when compared with 72% humidity) {58]. Conversely, the infectivity of aerosols of most enveloped viruses is not notably altered by changes in the relative humidity, although in general enveloped viruses are more sensitive to environmental inactivation.",

            "text": "The G I tract presents formidable chemical barriers to the entry of viruses. The mechanisms by which agents such as those present in the GI tract (e.g., acids, bile salts, proteolytic enzymes) affect viral structure, and hence determine the ability of a virus to survive transit through the local environments present at entry sites such as the GI tract, are gradually becoming understood. In the case of nonenveloped viruses, the outer capsid proteins appear to be the major determinants of viral stability to a wide variety of physicochemical agents. For example, rhinoviruses are rapidly inactivated at acidic p H levels, whereas other picornaviruses, such as polio, are not. One practical consequence of this is that rhinoviruses do not survive transit through the stomach and hence rarely produce disease outside the limited confines of the respiratory tract. Exposure of rhinoviruses to an acidic p H results in the loss of the viral capsid protein V P 4 . This in turn produces a \"hole\" in the virus particle through which the viral nucleic acid leaks out, leaving a noninfectious \"empty\" viral capsid. Interestingly, the same type of structural alteration can occur in polioviruses exposed to certain adverse physical conditions, which again emphasizes the role of the viral capsid in determining virion stability [45, 731. Another example of the role of outer capsid proteins in determining viral stability can be seen in the reoviruses. These viruses, like the enteroviruses, are neurotropic viruses whose natural portal of entry is via the GI tract. The three serotypes of reovirus show profound variations in their in vitro sensitivity to a number of physicochemical agents, including temperature, pH, alcohol, and detergent solutions. Studies using reassortant viruses containing genes derived from \"sensitive\" and \"resistant\" serotypes of virus (see Fig. 2 for an analogous experiment) allowed specific genes to be identified and associated with particular phenotypes. Sensitivity to alkahne p H and guanidine mapped to the viral S 1 gene, sensitivity to high temperature and the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate mapped to the S4 gene, and sensitivity to phenol and ethanol mapped to the M2 gene. In each case these genes encode proteins that are components of the outer cap-sid of the virus, indiccating again the importance of these proteins in determining susceptibility to environmental conditions [17., 181. Just as they differ with respect to sensitivity to p H changes, viruses vary in their response to proteolytic enzymes. Some viruses are extremely sensitive to trypsin-foot and mouth disease virus demonstrates a 103 drop in infectious titer upon treatment with it-and others, like influenza, need the effects of a trypsin-like protease to become infectious E23, 411. The human rotaviruses, which are enteric pathogens, show dramatic enhancement of infectivity in the presence of trypsin, which cleaves the V P 3 outer capsid protein 1691. Reoviruses also differ in their sensitivity to proteolytic digestion with enzymes such as chymotrypsin [4, 343. Genetic studies have shown that the viral M 2 gene, which encodes an outer capsid polypeptide (Mlc), is responsible for determining sensitivity or resistance to proteolysiij by chymotrypsin [66] .",

In the case of influenza virus, a trypsin-like protease present in host cells cleaves the hemagglutinin protein into two smaller peptides, HA1 and HA2, held together by a tlisulfide bond. The cleavage and subsequent removal (of an arginine residue exposes the hydrophobic N H 2 terminal of HA2, which is essential for the fusion function of this virus (see below) [23}. If influenza virus is grown in cells that lack this peptidase activity, H A cleavage does not occur, and, though the virus still binds to cellular receptors, it is not infectious [20, 41, 67, 681. Enveloped viruses-those that incorporate a lipid bilayer on their out'er surface-are particularly sensitive to inactivation b y bile salts, which dissociate the lipoprotein components of the viral envelope. This may explain why enveloped neurotropic viruses only rarely enter the h0:jt via the GI tract (the coronaviruses, which include the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus, are a known exception to this rule). The neurotropic viruses that commonly use the GI portal of entry are all nonenvel.oped and therefore insensitive to the action of bile salts.",

In general, this means primary replication must occur in a target cell outside the CNS, and then the virus must reach the CNS by either the bloodstream (hematogenous spread) or via nerves (neural spread). It is (1) CNS target cell, (2) the efficiency of spread after the primary infection of these target cells, and (3) the success of the host's immune response that determine whether a virus will be neuroinvasive. Incidentally, under most circumstances this combination of factors reduces the incidence of successful CNS infections, making these a small proportion of the total number of infections caused by viruses, even those that are traditionally considered neurotropic.",

One frequently used approach, primarily with RNA viruses, is the selection of antigenic variants with monoclonal antibodies C26, 39, 71, 72) . In this ap- proach, a virus mutant present in the initial stock at low concentration is amplified by neutralizing the wildtype virus with a monoclonal antibody (Fig 3) . The resultant virus variant contains a mutation in the protein against which the neutralizing antibody is directed, which in most instances is the protein responsible for attachment to cellular receptors. That mutation can usually be mapped to one or two amino acids which, being altered, prevent binding of the mutant virus by the monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibody variants have been used to map the antigenic sites of the influenza hemagglutinin 122, 76, 771 and have been used successfully to define important regions of the cellular binding proteins of rabies virus, reovirus, coronaviruses, and the California serogroup-all CNS pathogens. Antigenic variants of the California serogroup obtained with a single monoclonal antibody have altered neuroinvasiveness; if injected directly into the CNS their pathogenesis is not altered. Thus, the property of neuroinvasiveness can be specifically associated with a single protein in this system 1261. By sequencing the genome of the variant virus and comparing this sequence with that of the wild-type parent, it may be possible to show that the property of neuroinvasiveness is associated with specific regions within the glycoprotein molecule, as has been done in other systems f34).",

Fusion at the plasma membrane has been observed for viruses like herpes simplex and coronaviruses, both of which are capable of forming giant syncytia during routine infection. Presumably there are no special requirements for internalization under these circumsi:ances, and if the appropriate receptors are present the virus will appear within the cell. Other viruses are not capable of fusing directly with the cell membrane, and for those the endocytotic pathway (outlined in Figure 4 ) is the method of internalization. This pathway, which again resembles the mechanism of interrlalization of low-density lipoproteins [2 51, involves ithe collection of receptor-ligand complexes at regions of the membrane characterized by electron-dense material at their cytoplasmic side. The viruses are then transported within endocytotic vesicles, which have been determined to have a mildly acidic pH 142, 461.

Again using the influenza hemagglutinin as a model, such a change probably brings to the surface stretches of hydrophobic amino acids normally buriecl within the viral protein. The hydrophobic residues interact with the membrane of the endosome, fusing the viral envelope to it and releasing the contents of the virus into the cytoplasm, where the process of replication can then begin. In influenza and related viruses, a host protease is responsible for the cleavage step that prepares this portion of the hemagglutin for this exposure (from a precursor protein). This proteolysis is essential for replication and accounts for some of the host specificity of the viruses, as noted above.

Because of the lack of a suitable experimental animal, the state of the varicella-zoster virus latent genome is even less known than that of herpes simplex virus.",

Neurotropic viruses must penetrate the external barriers that protect the organism, replicate in an appropriate peripheral site, and then spread through either the bloodstream or through nerves to the CNS itself. Genetic analysis in several systems has pointed to lrhe external proteins as the main determinants of neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence. However, other factors, including host enzymes, activating factors, and the replicative machinery of the virus itself, must come into play. Ultimately, the balance between the viral machinery and the host immune system will determine the outcome of any infection.",

A variety of viruses are capable of persistently infecting cells of the CNS with either no detectable abnormalities at the cellular level or minimal cellular changes.

A variety of animal models have been developed with RNA viruses as well, including coronaviruses and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus.Infectious herpes simplex virus can be recovered from the trigeminal ganglia of many human cadavers and from some animals that have been experimentally infected. For in situ hybridization, a labeled genomic probe is base-paired to a cell genome immobilized on a glass slide. Enzymatic treatment of the cellular elements can distinguish between base pairing to DNA and RNA (suggesting, in some examples, that a DNA virus is being transcribed, or that an RNA virus has integrated itself in the host genome). Such techniques have demonstrated that herpes simplex virus DNA is present in most mice that have been infected and whose infection has become latent [631, in spite of the inability to recover infectious virus from explanted cultures.
