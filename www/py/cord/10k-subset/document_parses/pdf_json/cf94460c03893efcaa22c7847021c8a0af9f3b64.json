Facing with benign disease, the indications for surgery are still object of discussion in light of the stable natural course of most lesions and obvious drawbacks of any surgical intervention; therefore, in most situations, a conservative approach is recommended, and surgery is mainly reserved for those cases with persistent or worsening symptoms, or who are at risk for complications as malignant transformation. The advent of ablative techniques has widened the range of treatment options available to these patients, presenting as a valid alternative to resection in terms of safety and efficacy in selected cases, particularly in patients who are considered poor surgical candidates and with smaller lesions. This review outlines the role of percutaneous ablative methods for benign solid liver tumors that are encountered in adults, providing a per histology analysis of the existing evidence. The up-to-date strategies for management of the most common benign solid tumors are recapitulated.",

BLT are a diverse group of lesions with different cellular origins, in which clonal analysis has shown a spectrum of regenerative and neoplastic features [1] . They are relatively frequent, since autopsy series have reported incidences up to 50% [2] . BLT are generally classified into solid and cystic based on imaging characteristics; among them, cystic tumors probably occur more frequently than solid ones [3] . Hemangiomas (HH), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) are the most common solid BLT [4] .",

The trend toward a conservative approach for accidentally discovered liver lesions entails an accurate diagnosis to reassure both the patient and the clinician regarding the specific type of lesion and, consequently, its natural history. Thanks to the constant improvement of imaging modalities and better understanding of complications related to different histologies, most BLT can be managed safely with observation alone [4] . Therefore, radiological data are crucial for restricting the number of percutaneous biopsies and the resections performed for final diagnosis [5] .",

The patients treated in the other series were mostly asymptomatic except for a declared history of HCA-related hemorrhage present only in 11% and 22% of cases [10, 12] . The use of oral contraceptives was the main predisposing factor [10] [11] [12] . The decision to pursue percutaneous ablation therapy was based on a multidisciplinary discussion [12, 13] , or established considering multiple factors. Ablation was performed in patients not amenable to surgery in view of comorbidities, location or number of the lesions, or in cases otherwise requiring large liver resections [10, 13] , owing to an expected lower rate of procedural complications compared with surgery [13] . Van Vledder et al. treated 18 women with HCAs and, in this population, the desire to become pregnant was a relevant motivation to consider the intervention [10] .",

The rate of local technical failures reported in this study is relatively high, with 50% of patients requiring more than one RF ablation sessions to obtain a satisfactory treatment of all HCAs [10] . According to the data reported by Costa et al., only one out of 26 (4%) ablated HCAs showed evidence of residual disease at the first follow-up imaging with nodular or irregular enhancement, subsequently treated to complete ablation after a repeated session [11] . Moreover, they showed that fat tissue found in the ablation zone did not seem to be related to the residual tumor but was associated with significant steatosis and/or intratumoral fat [11] . Mironov et al. described complete ablation after the first treatment session in 88% of cases with total response with further ablative sessions [12] . Smolock et al. successfully treated 12 HCAs of which only one lesion of 8.3 cm diameter underwent two planned ablation sessions, therefore with a primary efficacy of 100% [13] .

In one study by Wang et al., preprocedural blood tests were performed to exclude malignant neoplasm (AFP, CEA and CA19-9) [15] . Indication to resort to ablative percutaneous strategies were mostly homogeneous among the considered studies, including the presence of \"large/giant\" HH associated to persistent-related symptoms in patients refusing open or laparoscopic surgical resection. Only discrepancy, though minor, was found in the definition for \"large\" HHs. Specifically, both Liu and Ziemlewick considered for treatment lesions greater than 4 cm, while all other studies referred to a cut-off of 5 cm [16, 17] . Reported symptoms included abdominal pain or distension, anemia, portal hypertension, obstructive jaundice, coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome) or serious psychological effects consequent to the diagnosis. Also, most of the authors considered the tendency to enlarge of an imaging proved HH as an inclusion criterion (more than 0.5 cm within one year; more than 1 cm after 2-year follow-up). Most common exclusion criteria comprised the presence of severe blood coagulation dysfunction, active inflammation or infection in any organ, acute or severe renal failure and cardio-pulmonary insufficiency. A distance lesser than 0.5 cm between the HH and hollow viscera (especially the gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder) and, by extension, large subcapsular HHs, were in some of the studies included among the reasons for surgery.",

The local technical failure rate seems to be proportional to the increasing lesion size: RFA of 45 HCAs with median size of 3.0 cm (range, 0.8-7.3 cm) resulted in a relatively low primary efficacy rate of 58% [10] . Van Vledder and colleagues have hypothesized that, in addition to the larger tumor size, the lack of cirrhosis and tumor capsule could also contribute to the lower effectiveness of RFA [10] . On the contrary, the good results of ablation using MWA technology could be justified by the greater volume of necrosis produced, by the relative insensitivity to the properties of the background tissue, and to the greater ability to overcome the macro and micro-perfusion conditions [7, 13] .",

The pathogenesis of HH is poorly understood, possibly reflecting hormonal congenital disorders [2] . HHs may have the tendency to enlarge over the time, probably due to progressive vascular ectasia rather than true neoplastic proliferation or neovascularization [36] . Usually detected incidentally during abdominal imaging performed for other indications, the vast majority of HHs are asymptomatic lesions with no need for clinical intervention. HH are frequently small (< 4 cm) and solitary, although \"giant\" lesions may reach 10 cm or more in diameter [2] . \"Large\" (> 4-5 cm) and especially \"giant\" HH may sometimes be symptomatic, with pain and bowel discomfort being the most frequently complained symptoms. SIR and coagulopathy such as Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS) represent rarer manifestations [37] . Although no clear consensus has been reached regarding which kind of lesion may be susceptible of treatment, therapeutic approach is usually proposed for tumors that are significantly growing, causing abdominal symptoms or entailing high risk of spontaneous or traumatic rupture. A wide spectrum of treatment strategies for HHs have been suggested over time. Surgical resection and tumor enucleation are used to be the first choices for enlarging and symptomatic cases. Although surgery can achieve complete removal of the tumor, this invasive approach involves relatively long hospitalization and periprocedural morbidity and mortality reported up to 31.5% and 3%, respectively [38, 39] . Furthermore, there is no clear established consensus, either on general management or on the most appropriate timing to resort to elective surgery, and decision-making is often based on the experience of the individual physician and local production volume. In recent years, imaging guided minimally invasive approaches have been proposed for the treatment of benign liver lesions, including TAE, radiation therapy and different ablation techniques involving various types of energy delivery systems. Both RFA and MWA have been performed during laparoscopy or percutaneously under CT or US guidance. Compared with other therapies, percutaneous ablation techniques have been increasingly used for the treatment of HHs, having the unique advantages of minimal invasiveness, low cost and incidence of complications, short hospitalization length and increased patient compliance. However, to the best of authors' knowledge, only one consensus attempt was made concerning the application of percutaneous ablative techniques in the treatment of these lesions, however, limited to RFA application. TAE and radiation therapy have not been considered curative therapies for HHs because of their poor results and serious complications, although TAE has been considered to manage the KMS, as well as medical therapy with corticosteroids or vincristine [37, 40] . Therefore, ablation therapies are a safe, feasible, and effective approach to HHs, even for greater lesions.",

            "text": "Hepatic angiomyolipomas are rare mesenchymal neoplasms which most commonly arise in the kidney and only sporadically develop in the liver parenchyma. They may present as solitary mass or as multiple lesions when associated with tuberous sclerosis and entail a very small malignant potential [1, 27, 42] . Liver biopsy is warranted in most patients presenting with lesions suspected for angiomyolipomas, since imaging may be inconclusive due to the rarity of the condition and the frequent resemblance to HCA and hepatic carcinoma, especially when the fat component is small or unapparent [1, 5] . Conservative management is generally recommended for asymptomatic patients who agree with follow-up strategy, whereas surgery is reserved for larger nodules (greater than 5 cm). RFA may be a valid alternative in certain cases, since it has shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of smaller lesions; in most of these patients with small angiomyolipomas, the drive behind the choice of a different approach was psychological pressure and consequent strong wish to intervene [27] .",

The advantages of ablative procedures compared to extirpative surgery include reduced morbidity and faster recovery time. Although image-guided percutaneous ablation methods have proved to be safe and effective for treatment of benign liver lesions in selected cases, the current evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation, and the decision to pursue ablation rather than surgery requires careful consideration: percutaneous ablation may be considered a valid alternative in patients who are poor surgical candidates for comorbidities or multiple lesions, who have smaller tumors, BLT-related symptoms or are at risk of complications, or for those who desire to intervene despite the reassurance by the physician regarding the benign origin and stable natural history of the tumor.",
