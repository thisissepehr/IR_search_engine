Flavaspidic acids PB and AB were isolated from the D. crassirhizoma rhizomes by methanol extraction, followed by silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. The chemical structures were characterized by spectral techniques, including ESI-MS, UV, 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectrum analysis. When the antimicrobial activity of the extracts and compounds was tested by the paper disc method, the extracts and compounds were highly active against Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 1928 (a MRSA bacterium), Streptococcus mutans and Bacillus subtilis. The extracts and compounds were not active against fungi and chlorella. Our study revealed that the antibacterial activity of samples from D. crassirhizoma was mainly related to the flavaspidic acids.",

            "text": "The thick-stemmed wood fern (Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai, Dryopteridaceae) is a semi-evergreen plant that grows on the deciduous forest floor as a pteridophyte. Two ferns, Dryopteris crassirhizoma and Osmunda japonica, are commonly used as antiinfection agents, especially for the common cold and flu, and are frequently collectively referred to as the fern (Dharmananda, 2003) . Recently, the fern has also been used as the major plant with six Chinese herbs (Astragalus, Atractylodes, Red Atractylodes, Pogostemon, Adenophora, Lonicera), a combination that was recommended as a prescription formula to prevent SARS. Its rhizomes have also been used in a vermicide (Namba, 1993) . In the search for natural products with antimicrobial activity, methanol extracts of the D. crassirhizoma rhizome exhibited antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. Phloroglucinols (albaspidin, aspidin, flavaspidic acids and dryocrassin) and kaempferol acetyl rhamnosides (crassirhizomosides AC and sutchuenoside A) have been isolated from D. crassirhizoma (Noro et al., 1973; Widen et al., 1996; Min et al., 2001) . Recently, acylphloroglucinols isolated from D. crassirhizoma were reported to inhibit fatty acid synthase (Na et al., 2006) . In addition, the compound showed a cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress-induced cell damage via catalase activation (Kang et al., 2006) . The phloroglucinol composition of 18 species (including subspecies) that belong to Dryopteris Adanson sect. Fibrillosae Ching has been investigated on a world-wide basis (Widen et al.,, 1996) . Phloroglucinols were observed to have anti-tumorpromoting activity (Govind et al., 1996) , nitric oxide inhibitory effect (Rie et al., 2001) , anti-reverse transcriptase activity (Hideo et al., 1991) and antioxidant activity (Lee et al., 2003) . Since Namba (1982) (Do, 1993) . Antimicrobial activity of phloroglucinols was once reported by Abbey et al. (2000) . However, these phloroglucinols were acylated phloroglucinols from Helichrysum caespititium. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of rhizome extracts and flavaspidic acids PB and AB from D. crassirhizoma against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, fungi and chlorella.",

The methanol extract (150 g) was suspended in H 2 O (1 L) and then partitioned successively with hexane (1 L \u00d7 2), ethyl acetate (1 L \u00d7 2), and BuOH (1 L \u00d7 2). The dry ethyl acet-ate extract (80 g) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (70-230 mesh, Merck, Germany). A step gradient was used for elution; each step constituted a 10% increase in acetone (in 1 L volumes) with hexane (10% acetone in 1 L volume), up to 80% acetone. Eleven 1-L fractions were collected. These fractions were tested by in vitro antimicrobial assays, and the active fractions (fr. 5, 6) were combined. Using methanol as a solvent, the active fraction (8 g) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 to afford two active compounds: flavaspidic acid PB (1, 300 mg) and flavaspidic acid AB (2, 150 mg), which were characterized by spectral methods (Noro et al., 1973; Do, 1993) .",

Also, flavaspidic acid PB was somewhat more active against Bacillus subtilis than flavaspidic acid AB.
