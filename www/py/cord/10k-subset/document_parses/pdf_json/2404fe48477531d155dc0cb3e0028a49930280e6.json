Statistical differences among more than two groups were determined using ANOVA. Each point corresponds to the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Figure 1 demonstrated the specificity of PKC, GSK3 and ITG family in TCs, network characters and molecular interactions of PKC family genes, GSK3 family genes or ITG family genes. Network elements and interactions of ITG subunit genes in mouse lung primary TCs were changed from day 5 to day 10 after the culture, and had positive communication (Fig. 1a) . The network characters and interactions of PKC genes in TCs were different from those in fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, ATII, airway basal cells, PACs, and varied significantly between TCs on days 5 and 10 (Fig. 1b) . The network characters of GSK subunit genes had negative communication on day 5, and became positive links on day 10 (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Mouse lung TCs were successfully isolated and constructed as a cell line as our previous reported [6] . These TCs have special characteristics including relatively small cell body and very long and thin Tps with lots of dilations (Fig. 4a) . To further confirm that the cells were TCs, triple immunofluorescent staining for CD34/PDGFR-\u03b1/vimentin was used. We found that these cells were triple positive for CD34/PDGFR-\u03b1/ vimentin (Fig. 2) , indicating that these cells were TCs. To understand potential regulations between those factors in TCs, we firstly investigated effects of external TGF\u03b21 at different concentrations and time points on TCs with ITGB1 (TC ITGB1+ ) and selected the concentration of TGF\u03b21 at 5 ng/ml for 48 h as the condition of further studies (Fig. 3a) . ITGB1 knocked down TC cells (TC ITGB1\u2212 ) were generated by lentivirus construction and infection with ITGB1 shRNA and evaluated by expression of ITGB1 gene (Fig. 3b) . TGF\u03b21 could induced the increased cell proliferations in TC ITGB1\u2212 cells at 48 h, as compared to TC ITGB1+ cells (Fig. 3c ). HS173 inhibited cell proliferation significantly in a dose-dependent pattern in TC ITGB1+ cells with or without TGF\u03b21 administration and had higher responses about 98% inhibitory rate at 5 \u03bcM, as compared to TC ITGB1\u2212 cells (Fig. 3d) . The proliferation of TGF\u03b21-pretreated TC ITGB1\u2212 cells was higher than vehicle-pretreated ones after HS173 administration, Fig. 3g ), rather than in TC ITGB1\u2212 cells. TGF\u03b21pretreated TC ITGB1\u2212 cells had significantly higher cell proliferation than vehicle-pretreated TC ITGB1\u2212 cells, even higher than TC ITGB1+ cells.",

The morphology of TC ITGB1+ treat with or without TGF\u03b21 for 24 h and 48 h were shown with Tps in Fig. 4a-f . TC ITGB1\u2212 cells had higher levels of cell proliferation in co-existence of TGF\u03b21 with HS173 at different doses with a dose-dependent pattern (Fig. 4g) , in TGF\u03b21 with GDC0941 at 5.0 \u03bcM (Fig. 4h) , in TGF\u03b21 with Enzastaurin at 0.25 \u03bcM (Fig. 4i) , or in TGF\u03b21 with SB216763 at three doses (Fig. 4j) .

Relevant morphological data was recorded and shown in Figure 4 A-F and Additional file 5: Figure S5 . We further analyzed the cell cycle of TC ITGB1+ and TCs ITGB1\u2212 to find out the mechanisms in ITGB1 mediated TCs proliferation (Fig. 7a, b) alteration and found that TGF\u03b21-treated TC ITGB1+ or TC ITGB1\u2212 number in G1 phase increased in a dose-dependent patter of HS173, while still was lower than after TGF\u03b21 and vehicle, except for HS173 at 5.0 \u03bcM (Fig. 7c, d) . TC ITGB1\u2212 number in G1 was significantly higher than TC ITGB1+ after co-treated with TGF\u03b21 and HS173. HS173 at 0.05 \u03bcM decreased the ratios of G1 phase and induced S phase arrest in TC ITGB1\u2212 compared with TC ITGB1+ which decreased in G1 and increased in S phase after treated with TGF\u03b21 and HS173 (Fig. 7c, d) . TC ITGB1+ decreased while TC ITGB1\u2212 increased in G2 phase with a dose-dependent pattern after TGF\u03b21 and GDC0941 (Fig. 7e, f ) . In opposite, TC ITGB1\u2212 decreased while TCs increased in S and G2 phases.

            "text": "TCs connect with themselves or other cells through three-dimensional networks of TCs-specific telopodes and cell proliferation to maintain the cell-cell communication and microenvironmental stability and accelerate the process of tissue repair [19] . PI3K and TGF family networks in TCs differed from other cells which appear in the lung tissue and PI3K-TGF signal pathways play the critical role in the regulation of TCs proliferation and expression of PI3K isoform genes [5] . The present study furthermore investigates roles of ITGB1 in PI3K-TGF signal pathways-regulated TCs bio-behaviors. Different integrin subunits binding to the same ligand can trigger different signal transduction, and the expression patterns of integrins on cell surface is the key to determine the response of cells to microenvironments to immune and inflammatory regulation [19] [20] [21] . Although ITGB1 on alveolar epithelium was found to alleviate epithelial injury and remodeling in acute respiratory distress syndrome [22] , profiles and functions of ITGB1 and their family members in lung TCs remain unclear due to the limited source of preliminary lung TCs. The present study firstly reported characters of ITGB family member networks and interactions in the primary mouse lung TCs, highly dependent upon cell types and functions. Of elements in TCs networks and interactions, ITGB4 declined and ITGB1 increased rapidly on day 10. We found that the interaction between PI3K and ITGB1 could complement the mechanisms of TCs proliferation and ITGB1 regulated TC sensitivity to PI3K isoform protein inhibition or PKC inhibition. ITGB1 plays critical roles in the maintenance of cell proliferation and movement, evidenced by the finding that the over-expression of ITGB1 genes could increase cancer cell proliferation and metastasis which was declined by deletion of ITGB1 gene [23] . TGF\u03b2 activation depends upon the cytoplasmic domain integrity of ITGB subunit which connects with actin cytoskeleton or the extracellular environment, e.g. specific binding of ITG\u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 to the arm domain of Pro-TGF\u03b21 [24] . Our data suggest that ITGB1 play the decisive role in TC survival and proliferation and change TC sensitivity to stimulators or inhibitors. The deletion of ITGB1 increased the sensitivity of TCs to PI3Kp/110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3 inhibitors, indicating that ITGB1 contributes to multiple signal pathways and the interaction between ITGB1 and TGF\u03b2 regulates cell fate and proliferation through intracellular PI3K/PKC/GSK pathways. For example, the binding of ITG\u03b1v\u03b26 with TGF\u03b21 could regulate the production of inflammatory mediators through the activation of HMGB1 in injured epithelial cells, accelerating lung tissue repair and curing [25] . We noticed that the dose of TGF\u03b21 which did not increase TC ITGB1+ proliferation could accelerate TC ITGB1\u2212 proliferation, and such effects of TGF\u03b21 became more obvious when PI3K/PKC/GSK pathways were down-regulated in TC ITGB1\u2212 cells, especially GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2 signal pathways.",

It was evidenced by the finding that TGF\u03b21 increased proliferation increased in TCs with combined inhibition of ITGB1 and one of PI3K/p110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3\u03b2 signaling. We propose that the hyper-sensitivity of TC ITGB1\u2212 with either inhibitor may result from the compensatory mechanisms of other signal pathway function or crosstalk as in other condition [26] [27] [28] . The interaction of ITGB-PI3K plays important roles in the maintenance of normal lung cell hemostasis and function and the response to inflammation, though it is unclear in lung TCs. For example, ITGB1 protein could regulate the activation of NF\u03baB and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in alveolar macrophage [20] , control intracellular transcription, accelerate cell cycle progression, movement, survival, metabolism, and DNA damage [29] . TGF-\u03b2 regulates cell fate and plasticity as well as multifunctional cellular responses via mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) or non-SMAD pathways or ITGB1 pathway band with fibronectins and tenascin-C PI3K/AKT pathway, as explained in Fig. 7 . The conversion from oleate-activated transcription factor (PIP2) to plasma membrane intrinsic protein 3 (PIP3) regulated by PI3K isoform proteins is the central process of the interaction between Akt and GSK or between PKC and Akt directly or indirectly [30] [31] [32] .",

            "text": "It is also possible that PI3K inhibitors could inhibit the fibrinogen/tenascin-C binding to ITG\u03b1IIb\u03b23 by inducing GTPase-Rap1 or the PI3K p110\u03b2 and PI3K p110\u03b3 directly as downstream integrins by inducing activation of G protein-coupled receptors [30] . Figure 7 demonstrates that integrins regulate the activity of PI3K signaling pathway and cause the accumulation of PIP3. ITG\u03b12\u03b21 was found to activate PI3K p110\u03b2, RasGRP2, or GTP binding to Rap1b, to amplify the activation of ITG\u03b12\u03b21signals and forming regulatory feedback loops around the cell membrane [31] . The interaction between ITGB-PI3K could influence the selective bind to ITG\u03b1v\u03b23 receptor to regulate cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell migration [32] . Our results demonstrate that ITGB1 plays the significant role in the regulation of TC proliferation, since the inhibition of PI3Kp110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, or PKC\u03b2 caused the increase in S phase of TCs with ITGB1, while mainly in G1 phase in TCs without ITGB1, different from the inhibition of GSK3\u03b2. We hypothesize that PIK3CG gene and protein p110-\u03b3 may play the regulatory roles in cell cycle responses to TGF and those inhibitors in the absence of ITGB1. PI3K/Akt plays important roles in the molecular mechanism of cell cycle and survival through the signals of Akt/PKC/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) and GSK-3 [33] and regulates GSK-3\u03b2-dominated downstream survival signaling pathway of serine/threonine kinase [34] .",

Both switches are required for the activation of class IA PI3K mediated by TGF\u03b21 [35] and also result in the activation of PI3Kp110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3 (Fig. 8) .

J Transl Med (2019) 17:431 compensatory mechanisms may occur among TGF\u03b21induced PI3Kp110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3 when ITGB1 gene was deleted, leading to alterations of TCs cell cycle and proliferation. Of those PI3K isoform protein genes, mRNA expression of PIK3CG altered with ITGB1negative TC cycle and proliferation. Such compensatory mechanism can provide insights for understanding molecular mechanisms by which TCs have strong capacity of proliferation and repair and of cell-cell communication and for investigating the potential roles of TCs in the development of drug resistance.",
