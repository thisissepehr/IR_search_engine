The main causal mechanism is the increase in blood pressure, which leads to increased left ventricular wall stress; however, aldosterone release from the adrenals and (more controversially) the direct action of angiotensin II on the cardiomyocytes also play a role. Large clinical trials evaluating the blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated an ability to prevent progression and induce regression of left ventricular mass, thereby reducing the signifi cant and independent cardiovascular risk conferred by LVH. Regression of left ventricular mass is also achieved by other medication classes, but the RAS blockers have an additional benefi cial effect for the same blood pressure reduction, for which the mechanism is not entirely clear. Studies comparing the effi cacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers to achieve LVH regression have not demonstrated any clear benefi t of one class over the other.",

The most common cause worldwide is essential hypertension, but other pressure overload states such as aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta also cause LVH. Some 65 million adults in the United States alone have hypertension [1] , and this remains the leading attributable risk factor for death in the world [2\u2022\u2022] . In addition to pressure overload, LVH is also caused by volume overload states such as myocardial infarction or regurgitant valvular disease, or it may result from genetic defects such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The increase of LVM seen with exercise training in elite athletes is considered a special case of \"physiologic hypertrophy,\" which is mediated by different signaling pathways and leads to enhanced cardiac performance without any additional risk of adverse outcomes [3] .",

The risk conferred is additional to the risk due to hypertension when that is the underlying cause, and it is also additional to other traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and age. Further work since Framingham has shown that a continuous relationship exists between cardiovascular risk and LVH even when the LVM is within the \"normal\" range [9] . A review summarizing more than four decades of research including 48,545 patients found that the adjusted overall relative risk of all-cause mortality associated with LVH was 2.5 (range, 1.5-8.0) [10] . Ghali et al. [11] reported that all-cause mortality (per 100 patient years) in patients without coronary artery disease varied depending on the geometry of the hypertrophy, from 1.5% without LVH to 1.7% for eccentric LVH and 2.2% for concentric LVH. Additional mortality was seen in patients with coronary artery disease, but the same pattern persisted. The exact mechanism of this strong association remains elusive, but it is likely that LVM is a measure that refl ects the long-term cumulative effect of a number of risk factors for cardiovascular disease.",

Renin is the rate-limiting step for the entire RAS and acts by cleaving fi ve amino acids off the hepatically synthesized circulating peptide angiotensinogen to produce the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). A further two amino acids are cleaved off by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) found in vascular endothelium, particularly in the lungs, to form the active molecule angiotensin II (Ang II), which is responsible for almost all of the end effects of the system.",

A study by Xiao et al. [26] increased the expression of the ACE gene in mouse cardiomyocytes 100-fold while removing ACE expression from both the kidney and vascular endothelium; they achieved a fourfold increase in local cardiac Ang II. This led to slightly low BP, marked atrial enlargement, and a high incidence of sudden death, but no hypertrophy or fi brosis. Van Kats et al. [27] engineered transgenic mice to express an Ang II-producing fusion protein exclusively in cardiomyocytes. The resulting 20-fold to 40-fold increase in local cardiac Ang II led to the development of some interstitial fi brosis, but again no hypertrophy. The amount of Ang II leaking from the heart was insuffi cient to affect either plasma Ang II or systolic BP, and an exogenous challenge of Ang II confi rmed that these mice had a normal hypertrophic response to raised circulating levels. When a degradation-resistant form of Ang II was expressed, the Ang II level in the heart reached thousands of times the normal level and began to spill into the circulation, but hypertrophy did not occur until BP began to rise in response to the circulating Ang II.",

The cardiac MRI substudy to ONTARGET used cardiac MRI and 3D analysis to accurately quantify LVM in 330 patients. The results (unpublished data) showed LVM regression by 4.8% in the ramipril group, 3.3% in the telmisartan group, and 5.8% in the combination group, but did not demonstrate any signifi cant differences between the treatment groups after 2 years. The reduction in LVM was lower than previously reported, a difference thought to be due to the high level of preexisting and ongoing concomitant therapy. (Two thirds of patients were on \u03b2-blockers and one third on CCBs. ) The ONTARGET study supports the fi nding that there is no clinically signifi cant difference in the regression of LVM between ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and combination therapy. As both HOPE and ONTARGET recruited patients with a variable cardiac phenotype rather than simple hypertensive pressure overload, undetected differential effects may have occurred in some subgroups.",

It is well established that LVH is an important risk factor for cardiovascular events and that blockade of the RAS with either ACE inhibitors or ARBs can slow progression or induce regression of LVH, with consequent reduction in cardiovascular risk. Both classes of medications seem equally able to achieve a greater effect on LVM than other medication classes despite the same lowering of BP, with ONTARGET demonstrating no additional benefi t of using them in combination. The most important clinical consideration in choosing between the two classes is probably the reported greater tolerability of ARBs.",
