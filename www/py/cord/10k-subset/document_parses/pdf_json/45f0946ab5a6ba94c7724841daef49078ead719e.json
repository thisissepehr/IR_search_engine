Based on this, monoclonal antibodies are having much rapid development, such as those against CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1).But the cost of preparation of monoclonal antibodies is too high and the therapeutic effect is still under restrictions. Recently, a series of soluble immune checkpoints have been found such as sCTLA-4 (soluble CTLA-4) and sPD-1 (soluble PD-1). They are functional parts of membrane immune checkpoints produced in different ways and can be secreted by immune cells. Moreover, these soluble checkpoints can diffuse in the serum. Much evidence has demonstrated that these soluble checkpoints are involved in positive or negative immune regulation and that changes in their plasma levels affect the development, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Since they are endogenous molecules, they will not induce immunological rejection in human beings, which might make up for the deficiencies of monoclonal antibodies and enhance the utility value of these molecules. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investigating novel soluble checkpoints and their functions, and it is promising to develop relevant therapies in the future. In this review, we describe the production mechanisms and functions of various soluble immune checkpoint receptors and ligands and discuss their biological significance in regard to biomarkers, potential candidate drugs, therapeutic targets, and other topics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Immune checkpoints are molecules that can increase or decrease the signals of the immune system, and they are considered to be critical factors in treating infections, cancers and autoimmune diseases. Currently, immune checkpoint therapy is seen as a pillar of cancer therapy [1] . Among the different checkpoint therapies, those involving PD-1 and CTLA-4 may be the most effective. CTLA-4 is considered to be the first functional immune checkpoint, as it stops T cells in lymph nodes at the initial stage of naive T-cell activation, while the PD-1 pathway suppresses activated T cells at the later stages of an immune response, typically in peripheral tissues [2] . In clinical trials, the anti-CTLA-4 antibody and the anti-PD-1 antibody have shown tremendous promise against a wide spectrum of solid and hematological malignancies, significantly improving OS (overall survival) in newly diagnosed and heavily pretreated patients alike [3] . However, the influences of soluble receptors and ligands on immune regulation and cancer treatment have been less well studied. Soluble receptors and ligands, which are part of a family including full-length receptors and ligands, are produced by mRNA expression or by the cleavage of membrane-bound proteins and are found free in the plasma. These entities may play important roles in immune regulation via interactions between soluble receptors and full-length ligands or between soluble ligands and full-length receptors. For example, alternative splice variants of the human PD-1 and CTLA-4 genes have been identified, and sPD-1 can interfere with PD-L1/2 (programmed cell death ligand-1/ 2, also known as B7-H1/2):full-length PD-1 interactions, thereby blocking the negative signal imparted by the transmembrane form of PD-1 [4, 5] .

Some take part in costimulatory interactions, such as CD137L/CD137 and OX40L/CD40 [9] , while others, such as HVEM/BTLA and MHCII/LAG3 [10] , are involved in inhibitory interactions.

The PD-1/ PD-L1 pathway in the TME (tumor microenvironment) can inhibit the activation of effector T cells and promote the generation of Treg cells; this shows that PD-1-induced immune suppression may cause cancer cells to escape immune surveillance [13] . The blockade of this pathway in many therapeutic strategies can promote antitumor effects. CTLA-4 is expressed in T cells, B cells, NK cells, NKT cells, and DCs. CTLA-4 is homologous to CD28, but it has an approximately 100-fold higher affinity for both CD80 and CD86 than CD28. Similar to PD-1, CTLA-4 inhibits T cell activation by binding to its ligand [14] . Moreover, CTLA-4 also inhibits IL-2 production and influences naive CD4 + T cell differentiation. Both antibody blockade of CTLA-4 and genetic deletion of CTLA-4 induce the generation of Th17 cells and improve Th2 cell differentiation. In addition, CTLA-4 can control not only T cell effector functions but also B cell responses by regulating the functions of T follicular helper cells and T follicular regulatory cells [15] .

Researchers have also used adenovirus to transduce the thymidine kinase gene and sPD-1 into tumors, which causes tumor regression by upregulating the activation of CD8 + T cells [24] . Moreover, in research on cancer treatments using a combination of the HSP70 vaccine and sPD-1, it has been found that sPD-1 can not only block PD-L1 but also reduce the expression of IL-10 gene, a negative regulatory gene [25] . Fibronectin CH50 has been demonstrated to increase the activity of macrophages, and in vivo studies have demonstrated that a sPD-1-CH50 recombinant peptide increases the cytolytic activity of both macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, especially towards PD-L1-positive tumor cells.

In China, researchers used naked plasmids to deliver sPD-1-CH50 into tumor inoculation sites and For example, sPD-1 has been reported to be a monomer, and it can be produced by PBMCs through mRNA expression. Moreover, sPD-1 can combine with PD-L1 and PD-L2, thus blocking PD-L/PD-1 interactions and somehow activating CD8+ T cells.

When patients were in CR (complete remission), their sPD-L1 levels returned to normal [34] . In a clinical study about malignant melanoma, early changes in sPD-L1 levels after checkpoint blockade treatment did not correspond with benefit. However, rise in sPD-L1 after 5 months of treatment correlated with partial responses in ipilimumabtreated patients. And rise in sPD-L1 after pembrolizumab treatment was also associated with partial responses, and high pre-treatment levels were associated with disease progression [35] .

In another study on 141 patients with HBV-related HCC, circulating PD-L1 expression was closely related to intratumoral PD-L1 expression and PD-1/PD-L1 expression was associated with tumor size, blood vessel invasion and BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) stage. Moreover, patients with higher expression of circulating PD-L1 and PD-1 had shorter OS and tumor-free survival times than those with lower expression. These results show that patients with higher sPD-1 and sPD-L1 levels have a worse prognosis [37] .

Indeed, the inhibition of sCTLA-4 with anti-sCTLA-4-mAb induces significant increases in antigen-specific immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses, the selective blockade of sCTLA-4 activates the proliferation of CD8 + and CD4 + T cells and promotes increased cytokine secretion, most notably the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, which in turn enhances antitumor effects [51] .

However, CTLA-4 binds to CD80 and CD86 with Kd values of 0.2 \u03bcM and 2.6 \u03bcM respectively, which are approximately 10-fold lower than the Kd values for the binding of CD28 to CD80 and CD86 (4 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM, respectively) [52] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 282, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 960, "end": 964, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1267, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biological mechanism"}, {"text": "Thus far, there have been few studies on the implications of sCTLA-4 in cancer treatment.

Many studies regarding these entities are ongoing, and the relevance of soluble receptors and ligands to various diseases is becoming increasingly apparent. As soluble molecules, their serum and tissue Such studies supply information for the formulation of therapeutic strategies. The type of analyses refers to the way of analysis of the associations between levels and prognosis or outcomes. + means higher than controls; \u2212 means lower than controls; \\ in serum/plasma levels means no significant difference between patients and controls, \\ in types of analyses and prognosis/outcomes means no data found levels can be easily detected. These molecules may also be critical factors for evaluating the severity and prognosis of cancer and many other diseases since most patients experience changes in their levels (See Table 2 ); in addition, some soluble molecules have been reported to be predictive markers for the benefit of target therapy (See Table 3 ). In immunotherapy, immunogenicity of checkpoint inhibitors is still a severe problem, and the detection of anti-drug antibodies is still equated as a main way to measure immunogenicity [84] . According to the characteristics of soluble receptors, it is probable for them to neutralize the effect of monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, whether they are included or paly important role in the hypersensitivity reactions during therapy is also unknown, since the interaction and changes of levels of these molecules are complicated. Thus, it is hopeful but there is a long way to find applicable soluble molecules to predict immunogenicity. Moreover, their exact functions are still unclear. Thus far, studies have developed methods to assess some of these proteins, such as sPD-1 and sCTLA-4. Thus, we can use these technologies for further research. In addition to detecting the proteins, some researchers have successfully mediated their serum levels to regulate the human immune system, suggesting that such manipulations can potentially be used in cancer treatment. Based on limited experimental and clinical findings, these soluble receptors and ligands can be novel therapeutic targets. Although it has been established that the concentrations of soluble receptors can influence the activation of APCs and T cells, the specific relevance of these factors is still unknown; nevertheless, we can use antibodies such as anti-PD-1-mAb and anti-CTLA-4-mAb to block these targets and neutralize their various functions in the progression of diseases. However, it may be necessary-yet difficult-to find more specific antibodies to precisely mediate these targets since current antibodies cannot distinguish between full-length receptors and soluble receptors. Although it will be some time before the precise regulatory roles of these soluble receptors and ligands are illuminated, it is imperative that they are considered in the formation of strategies for immunotherapy.
