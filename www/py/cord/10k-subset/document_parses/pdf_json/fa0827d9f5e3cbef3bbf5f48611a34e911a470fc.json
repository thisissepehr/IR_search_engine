These disorders are characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that affect alveolar walls. Typical features of ILD include dyspnea, diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs, and abnormal pulmonary function tests with restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange. Many pathological situations can impair gas exchange and, therefore, may contribute to progressive lung damage and ILD. Consequently, diagnosis approach needs to be structured with a clinical evaluation requiring a careful history paying attention to exposures and systemic diseases. Several classifications for ILD have been proposed but none is entirely satisfactory especially in children. The present article reviews current concepts of pathophysiological mechanisms, etiology and diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutic strategies. The following diagnostic grouping is used to discuss the various causes of pediatric ILD: 1) exposure-related ILD; 2) systemic disease-associated ILD; 3) alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD; and 4) ILD specific to infancy. Therapeutic options include mainly anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and/or anti-fibrotic drugs. The outcome is highly variable with a mortality rate around 15%.

The last ERS monography on ILD provided a chapter on pediatric classification which is based on a clear distinction between children aged 0-2 years and children over 2 years-old [7] . Indeed the stage of lung development and maturation should be taken into consideration when approaching a diagnosis of pediatric ILD. In this view, a new term \"diffuse lung disease\" has recently been introduced that comprises a diverse spectrum of lung disorders with impaired gas exchange and diffuse infiltrates by imaging. These disorders, more prevalent in young children, include diffuse developmental disorders, lung growth abnormalities, neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, surfactant dysfunction disorders, disorders related to systemic diseases, disorders of immunocompromised host, and disorders of normal host caused by various insults such as aspiration syndrome or infections [8] .

Clara cells secrete nonsticky proteinaceous compounds to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles, which constitute the quiet zone between the conducting and the respiratory lung zones [10] . The terminal bronchioles are surrounded by a spiral of smooth muscle. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form respiratory bronchioles which contain a small number of alveoli. Consequently, the term of diffuse lung disease refers to disorders that can affect both the distal part of the conducting and the respiratory lung zones, and include ILD as well as pathological processes leading to obstruction/ obliteration of small airways [8] .

Following injury, alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) may actively participate in the restoration of a normal alveolar architecture through a coordinated process of re-epithelialization, or in the development of fibrosis through a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [20] . Complex networks orchestrate EMT leading to changes in cell architecture and behaviour, loss of epithelial characteristics and gain of mesenchymal properties. The reasons for epithelial cell loss and inappropriate re-epithelialisation are still debated, but ongoing apoptosis is believed to be a key component in the progression of the disorder [21] . Prolonged denudation of the basement membrane contributes to altered interactions and cross-talk between AECs and mesenchymal cells, resulting in profound modifications of cell functions with imbalanced production of oxidants, proteases, and polypeptide mediators including cytokines and growth factors such as Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and Endothelin (ET)-1.

Several stimuli including oxidant-antioxidant imbalance, viral proteins, inflammatory molecules, nutrient deprivation may induce ER stress [38, 39] ( Figure 2 ). Among the cytoprotective mechanisms available are the ER chaperones such as binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP).

More than 30 SFTPB (located on chromosome 2) mutations have been identified among patients with a congenital deficiency in SP-B. For SFTPC located on chromosome 8, at least 35 mutations have been described, localized primarily in the COOHterminal Brichos domain [44, 45] . A proposed function of the Brichos domain is a chaperone-like activity, which could prevent misfolding and aggregation of the parent protein. Alterations in the Brichos domain could therefore lead to diseases through mechanisms related to abnormal protein processing and cell toxicity [46] . Recently, several studies have also documented the role of ABCA3 deficiency in ILD. ABCA3 functions in the transport of surfactant lipids into lamellar bodies and is required to maintain pulmonary surfactant phospholipid homeostasis.

Alveolar epithelium regeneration and repair requires activation and proliferation of tissue-resident (progenitor) cells and their differentiation to replace the damaged cells [48] . However, unlike cancer cells, stem cells are not immortal and display decreasing telomere length with aging [49] . Telomere shortening has been documented to be associated with reduced capacity for stem cell renewal, and decreased activity of telomerase, the polymerase responsible for telomere maintenance. The stem cells of the alveolar epithelium are the type 2 AEC, and expression of telomerase has been documented in these cells [48] . Experimental studies have also indicated that telomerase is expressed mainly during lung development with a peak expression before birth followed by a decrease to nearly undetectable levels in mature alveolar epithelium. Interestingly, telomerase expression and activity could be reinduced in normal quiescent type 2 AEC exposed to oxidative stress [50] . The current understanding is that a population of type 2 AEC may have the capacity to survive injury through telomerase activation, and consequently may be responsible for repopulation of the damaged alveolar epithelium. On the basis of reports of pulmonary disorders in dyskeratosis congenita (a rare hereditary disease of poor telomere maintenance), recent and exciting findings have documented mutations in the telomerase gene in familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [51] . In addition, it is likely that environmental factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, or virus infection may modify telomerase activity and account for the development of organ-specific disease associated with telomerase dysfunction. In this view, new data in chronic respiratory diseases support the concept that alveolar stem cell dysfunction may play an important role in the rate of progression or severity in ILD [52] .

Some clinical situations have features certainly unique to children, but many of these diseases overlap their adult counterparts with the primary event being injury and damage of the alveolar epithelium [11, 13] . Yet, the overall outcome and prognosis of the diseases in children are thought to be less severe than in adult patients. In addition, pediatric ILD is more responsive to therapeutic strategies than adult ILD [9] . These differences may be explained by the types of initial injury, which may not be similar due to changes in the host environment. Another explanation is the modifications of the process of wound healing with age. Comparison of the response to injury in foetal and adult skin shows clear differences [53] . Skin wound healing in the foetus is characterized by complete regeneration of the skin and the absence of scar formation. Progressively with age, the skin looses the capacity to regenerate the original tissue architecture with the result being scar formation that extends outside the wound bed. The process of healing involves the coordinated regulation of cell proliferation and migration and tissue remodeling, predominantly by polypeptide growth factors [54] . The slowing of wound healing that occurs in the aged may be related to changes in the activity of these various regulatory factors. In a study on the role of aging in the development of cardiac fibrosis in the rabbit, differences in the cascade of events leading to myocardial remodeling were observed, with mainly the presence of more myofibroblasts synthesising collagen and expressing high levels of TGF-\u03b2 in older animals [55] . A study of growth factors involved in skin wound healing in young and aged mice also showed age-dependent changes. Expression of all the fibroblast growth factors was diminished in aged mice, even in healthy skin. In addition, the post-wound regulation of expression of these factors and of TGF-\u03b2 was less pronounced and slower than in young mice. These findings are in agreement with data observed in muscle that indicated significant alterations in the TGF-\u03b2 production with age [56, 57] . Other potential mechanism is linked to the observation that injury in adult tissues does in certain circumstances stimulate tissue regeneration, depending on the presence of small subsets of primitive stem cells. Stem cells are the self-renewing, primitive, undifferentiated, multipotent source of multiple cell lineages [49] . While such cells are critical for development and growth through childhood, residual pools of adult stem cells are hypothesized to be the source of the frequently limited tissue regeneration and repair that occurs in adults [58] . Unlike embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells are not immortal, and show decreasing telomere length with increasing age. The naturally limited replacement capacity of such endogenous stem cell pools may occur via exhaustion of the stem cell pool or arise as a consequence of inherited or acquired mutations that alter proper stem cell function [59] .

The connectives tissues are composed of two major structural proteins, elastin and collagen, with different types of collagen proteins in each tissue [103] . Many CTD feature abnormal immune system activity associated with inflammation. Pulmonary manifestations of CTD may include both vascular and interstitial components. From recent reports, the incidence of ILD in the context of CTD appears to be higher than previously appreciated [104, 105] . Importantly, ILD may precede the development of clinically obvious CTD, sometimes by months or years. Table 1 provides information on suggestive clinical and serological features in selected conditions. The main disorders to be considered in childhood are rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The other include Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, and mixed connective tissue disease. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder defined by its characteristic diarthroidal joint involvement. It is the most common CTD in children, but pulmonary involvement is less frequent than in adults. Genetic and environmental factors seem to be important contributors of disease progression, with influence of sex (more frequent in male), presence of two copies of the HLA-DRB1 \"shared epitope\" (HLA-DR SE) and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP), and possibly tobacco exposure [106, 107] .Almost 50% of patients with RA have specific serologic abnormalities several years before the onset of joint symptoms, and the findings of elevated serum levels of IgM rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP is associated with a high risk for the development of RA [107] . Systemic sclerosis Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by a progressive dermatologic abnormality [108] . Its etiology remains unknown; it is believed to be a complex disease in which interactions between environmental, auto-immune, and genetic factors result in various disease phenotypes [109] . Although it is a rare disease in childhood, the diagnosis is based on skin disease. Cardiopulmonary complications are common and have been associated with death in young patients. Almost all patients with SSc have serum antinuclear antibodies. The other autoantibody markers are listed in table 1. Recently, the presence of anti-DNA topoisomerase II autoantibody has been reported to be a key factor in the development of ILD, in association with class II MHC status (HLA-DR3, HLA-DPBI) [110] . Systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an auto-immune disorder characterized by the involvement and dysfunction of multiple organ systems.

The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and peripheral eosinophilia. It is confirmed by the presence of increased amounts of eosinophils in BAL and/or lung tissue eosinophilia. In this section, eosinophilic vasculitis will not be discussed (see chapter 6.2.2). The search for an etiology includes a combination of clinical and laboratory investigations. Eosinophilic lung diseases of known cause in children include mainly allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, parasitic infections and drug reactions. Eosinophilic lung diseases of unknown cause comprise Loeffler syndrome (characterized by migrating pulmonary opacities), acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [174, 175] . The idiopathic hyper-eosinophilic syndrome is a rare disorder observed mainly in adults; it is characterized by prolonged eosinophilia and a multiorgan system dysfunction due to eosinophil infiltration with pulmonary involvement documented in almost half of the patients [176, 177] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 956, "end": 961, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1249, "text": "[172]", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1360, "text": "[173]", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2218, "text": "[174,", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2223, "text": "175]", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2502, "text": "[176,", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2507, "text": "177]", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disorders affecting primarily the alveolar epithelium and the alveolar space"}, {"text": "Alveolar capillary dysplasia and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis The pulmonary capillaries form a dense sheet-like meshwork composed of short interconnected capillary segments.

Impaired development of this vascular network can be caused by genetic defects, prematurity or injury. Aberrant angiogenesis documented in pediatric patients include mainly alveolar capillary dysplasia, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis [178] . Alveolar capillary dysplasia is a rare disorder, presenting with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn [179] . The strongest diagnostic features are poor capillary apposition and density, allied with medial arterial hypertrophy and misalignment of pulmonary vessels [180] . Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is also a rare disease that is characterized by proliferation of capillary-sized vessels within the alveolar walls of the lung [181] . Intimal thickening and medial hypertrophy of the small muscular pulmonary arteries are present resulting in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Most cases appear sporadic. Chest imaging shows nodular pulmonary infiltrates and septal lines. A definitive diagnosis can be made only by histologic examination. Interestingly, capillary proliferation in the alveolar wall has been reported in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [182] . Lymphatic disorders Alveolar structure formation is characterized by refinement of the gas exchange unit and functional adaptation of endothelial cells into vessels including pulmonary lymphatics.

Secondary forms of lymphatic disorders result from a variety of processes such as chronic airway inflammation that impair lymph drainage and increase lymph production [186] . Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) syndromes are caused by the disruption of alveolar-capillary basement membrane as a consequence of injury to the alveolar septal capillaries, and less commonly to the arterioles and veinules. The hallmarks are intra-alveolar accumulation of red blood cells, fibrin, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
