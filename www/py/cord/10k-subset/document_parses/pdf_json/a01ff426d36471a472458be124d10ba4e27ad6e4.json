Since experimentally infected calves produce antibodies to Y. pseudotuberculosis and adult cattle have a high prevalence of antibodies and apparent resistance to challenge, it is probable that this is a very common infection in southern Australia with most older cattle being immune. Failure to isolate Y. pseudotuberculosis from calves less than 3 weeks old may indicate that maternal antibodies are protective in this age class. Infected calves were shown to excrete large numbers of the bacterium in their faeces. This could cause heavy environmental contamination and so rapid exposure of susceptible cattle. The seasonal incidence demonstrated (Table 2) , does not reflect the availability of susceptible host cattle and we conclude that this seasonality probably depends on the enhanced survival of the bacterium in a cool, damp environment.
