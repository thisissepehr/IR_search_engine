Various cell types produce IL-8, either in response to external stimuli such as cytokines or bacterial infection, or after malignant transformation. Anti-IL-8 strategies have been considered for anti-inflammatory therapy. In this paper we demonstrate that the RNA interference technique can be used to efficiently down-regulate IL-8 protein expression in airway epithelial cells. We used a helper-dependent adenoviral vector to express a small hairpin (sh)RNA targeting human IL-8 in cultured airway epithelial cells (IB3-1, Cftr -/-; C38, Cftr-corrected) stimulated with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or heat-inactivated Burkholderia cenocepacia. Stimulated IL-8 expression in IB3-1 and C38 cells was significantly reduced by shRNA expression. The shRNA targeting IL-8 had no effect on the activation of NF-\u03baB, or on the protein levels of I\u03baB or IL-6, suggesting that this anti-IL-8 strategy was highly specific, and therefore may offer potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

Patients with ulcerative colitis display increased levels of IL-8 in inflamed areas of the gut [3] . In addition, IL-8 is induced in synovial cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients [4] , and in the myocardium after ischemia and reperfusion in vivo [5] . Interestingly, elevated levels of IL-8 in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients is reduced by either antibiotic therapy or gene therapy with AAVCFTR [6, 7] .

Certain cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and many microbial products including lipopolysaccharide, tri-acyl lipopeptides and bacterial flagellin, are potent inducers of IL-8 expression in a variety of cells, such as macrophages and epithelial cells. Induction of IL-8 by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 is mediated through their corresponding receptors, which activate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [12, 13] . Similarly, microbial products induce IL-8 expression via a family of plasma membrane receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLR) [14] [15] [16] . TLRs are expressed in many types of cells including airway and intestinal epithelial cells [17] . They are part of the innate immune system for activating the expression of IL-8 and other genes to fight infection.",

Antibodies against IL-8 are effective for reduction of IL-8 activity in animal studies [19, 20] , but it is not clear whether this approach would work in humans. Since administration of antibodies is a systemic approach, this may compromise the host's ability to fight infection. In addition, repeated administration of antibodies can be very expensive. An alternative approach is to use CXCR2 receptor antagonists to block neutrophil influx and reduce inflammation. It has been shown that SB-265610, a non-peptide CXCR2 antagonist, can prevent neutrophil accumulation in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats [21] .",

            "text": "In this paper, we report a new tool for down-regulating IL-8 expression by using RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a relatively new discovery in post-transcriptional gene silencing [22] and an important tool for gene function analysis [23] [24] [25] [26] . The term RNAi was initially coined by Fire and coworkers [27] to describe the observation that doublestranded RNA targeted to a gene of interest, when introduced into nematodes, can result in degradation of the corresponding mRNA. This powerful technique was then developed for mammalian cells [23] . Since synthetic RNA oligos are not cost-effective, several groups have successfully developed DNA-based vectors to express short double-stranded RNA with a small hairpin loop structure (shRNA) to serve as small interfernce (si)RNA [25, 26, 28, 29] . We have designed an expression cassette using the U6 promoter to drive a shRNA targeting the IL-8 mRNA. Since the efficiency of gene transfer and episomal stability of adenoviral vectors is far superior to plasmids, we delivered the shRNA expression cassette to cultured human airway epithelial cells using a helper-dependent adenovirus vector (HD-Ad). HD-Ads [30] were developed in gene therapy research to overcome strong host immune responses to conventional adenoviral vectors. In HD-Ads, all adenoviral sequences are deleted except the viral inverted terminal repeats located at each end of the genome, and the viral packaging signal. The deletion of the viral genes prolongs transgene expression and also increases the cloning capacity to 36 kb [30] . We show that an shRNA expressed from an HD-Ad can effectively down-regulate endogenous IL-8 expression induced by proinflammatory cytokines or bacteria, in Cftr -/and Cftrcorrected lung epithelial cells.",

Although the RNAi strategy targeting IL-8 is expected to be gene-specific, nonspecific down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity could also reduce the level of IL-8 expression. To test this possibility, we performed EMSA to examine the NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from cells receiving various treatments. IL-8RNAi-HD-Ad did not interfere with TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 induced NF-\u03baB activation in IB3-1 or C38 cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 5, 7 and lanes 11, 13) . There was no change in NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity in un-induced cells, regardless of whether they were first transduced with IL-8RNAi-HD-Ad (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 14) . Similarly, IL-8RNAi-HD-Ad did not interfere with Bc-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 4B) . Under quiescent conditions NF-\u03baB is inhibited by binding to I\u03baB in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation I\u03baB is degraded, allowing NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and modulate inflammatory gene expression [36] . Both I\u03baB-\u03b1 and I\u03baB-\u03b2 were degraded quickly (in 15 min) following stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2, regardless of whether the cells were first transduced with IL-8RNAi-HD-Ad. IL-8RNAi-HD-Ad had no effect on the levels of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 in uninduced cells (Fig. 5) .",

In a rabbit model of lung reperfusion injury, reperfusion of the ischaemic lung induced local IL-8 production, massive neutrophil infiltration and destruction of pulmonary tissue. Administration of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IL-8 prevented neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury [18] . IL-8 antibody administration also significantly inhibited proteinuria, as well as infiltration of neutrophils into rabbit glomeruli, in an acute glomerulonephritis animal model initiated by deposition of immune complex [20] . In a mouse orthotopic bladder cancer model, a significant decrease in human tumor growth and invasion was observed after IL-8 antibody treatment [19, 47] . These observations suggest that IL-8 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in neutrophil-mediated acute inflammation, and possibly carcinogenesis. But the use of humanized antibodies in clinical applications is hindered by a combination of factors including a brief half-life and fast blood clearance, their immunogenicity, and high cost. Recent advances in sequence-specific gene silencing by double-stranded RNAs (RNA interference) provides a new platform to develop gene-specific drugs for disease management. Our results indicated that an IL-8RNAi expression plasmid significantly reduced the activity of a reporter gene (SEAP) containing an IL-8 target sequence. Although the use of plasmid-based shRNA expression has quickly become the preferred method for targeted gene silencing, there are limitations. The delivery of plasmids to certain types of cells such as primary cells, neural cells and stem cells is hampered by poor transfection efficiency. Delivery of expression plasmids to mammals as gene therapy is very inefficient, particularly to the lung [48] .",

Some groups [49] [50] [51] [52] have reported that efficient introduction and stable integration of shRNA-expression cassettes can be achieved using Moloney murine leukaemia virus, lentiviral vector systems or the first-generation adenoviral vectors. However, the first-generation Ad vector is not a good choice for delivery of anti-inflammatory shRNAs to mammals, since the vector itself provokes strong host inflammatory responses. HD-Ads cause significantly less inflammation in mammals since they do not express adenoviral genes, although some inflammation due to the capsid proteins still occurs. Like earlier generations of Ads, HD-Ads transduce most cell types very effectively. In addition, the integration frequency of vector DNA into the host genome is very low [53] , thus reducing risk of insertional mutagenesis in clinical applications. One concern about using HD-Ads, versus first-generation Ads, is the technical difficulty in producing these vectors. However, Palmer and Ng reported a new method that can shorten the production time of HD-Ads to 12 days, and produce >10 13 viral particles [54] .",

This activation is initiated through interactions between microbial products and various Toll-like receptors present in airway epithelial cells [57] . Activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway via TLRs can induce the expression of cytokines, including IL-8, which leads to inflammation. Furthermore, since IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils, overexpression of IL-8 can lead to excessive neutrophil infiltration and tissue damage. The level of IL-8 in CF airway is greatly enhanced compared to normal subjects [12, 13, 58, 59] and its overexpression may be a major cause of lung damage in CF patients. We demonstrated here that a clinically relevant Bc strain (heat-inactivated) can activate NF-\u03baB in airway epithelial cells, leading to increased IL-8 production. Stimulation of the cells with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or bacteria induced a higher level of IL-8 expression in IB3-1 cells (Cftr -/-) than in C38 cells (Cftrcorrected), in agreement with previous reports using these cell lines or primary cells [60, 61] . Although Cftr knockout mice can be used as a model for Bc infection in CF [62] [63] [64] , they are unfortunately not suitable for assessing our HD-Ad-IL-8RNAi. There is no bona fide mouse homologue of human IL-8, and our IL-8 target sequence does not share sequence homology with rodent functional IL-8 homologues, such as MIP-2, KC or CINC-1.

However, it is possible that not all sequences are gene-specific, and therefore each shRNA should be experimentally examined for nonspecific effects. Although we cannot rule out all genome-wide effects from the experiments performed here, the HD-Ad-IL8RNAi did not appear to affect the NF-\u03baB pathway, which regulates transcription of many cytokine genes including IL-8, nor did it affect IL-6 production, which is also regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathway. Use of a control HD-Ad (expressing lacZ) revealed that neither IL-8 nor IL-6 were induced by the Ad particle itself in cultured cells, although this does not rule out the possibility of inducing inflammatory cytokines in other cell types, such as macrophages [66] .",

Local administration of HD-Ad-IL8RNAi, for example to the lung, may be more practical. In addition, many delivery methods for gene therapy exacerbate inflammation. Our vector could be combined with other gene therapy vectors to minimize host inflammatory responses.",

The top part shows a strategy for generating siRNA from a DNA template in vivo. Two pairs of oligonucleotides are linked by Hind III site and inserted after the U6 promoter. The resulting RNA is predicated to fold back to form shRNA. The lower panel shows a reporter plasmid containing a target sequence from IL-8. The target sequence was inserted between the CMV promoter and SEAP gene before the start codon. (B) Analysis of the effectiveness of the IL-8 shRNA with the reporter system in COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.05 \u00b5g of pCMVSEAP or pCMVIL-8SEAP target, together with 1.5 \u00b5g pBS/U6-IL-8RNAi or empty vector (pBS/U6).
