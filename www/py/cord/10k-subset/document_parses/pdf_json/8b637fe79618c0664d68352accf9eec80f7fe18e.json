Using neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) could have additional benefits, including the use of lower sedative doses, improved patient-ventilator interaction and shortened duration of mechanical ventilation. We designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of keeping tidal volume (V T ) at protective levels with NAVA and PSV in patients with ARDS.",

Flow, peak airway pressure (Paw) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were captured from the ventilator, and a software (Matlab, Mathworks, USA), automatically detected inspiratory efforts and calculated respiratory rate (RR) and V T . Asynchrony events detection was based on waveform analysis.",

Paw was greater in NAVA (21 \u00b1 3 cmH 2 O) than in PSV (19 \u00b1 3 cmH 2 O, p = 0.001). Most patients were under continuous sedation during the study. NAVA reduced triggering delay compared to PSV (p = 0.020) and the median asynchrony Index was 0.7% (0-2.7) in PSV and 0% (0-2.2) in NAVA (p = 0.6835).",

Prolonged cycle (Fig. 2c ) was similar in NAVA and PSV; ineffective effort was observed in two patients during PSV, and absent during NAVA (Fig. 2d) . Triggering delay (Fig. 2e) was observed in 13 patients during PSV and in 10 patients during NAVA. Short cycle was observed in only one patient in PSV. AI was greater than 10% in two patients in both PSV and NAVA and was not significantly different between the two modes of ventilation (Fig. 2f ) , with a median of 0.7% (0-2.7) in PSV and 0% (0-2.2) in NAVA (p = 0.6835). To evaluate if protective MV could be sustained with NAVA, we compared the V T , RR and Paw for the 13 patients who completed the period of NAVA3h with controlled ventilation at Baseline. There was no statistical difference in V T (5.8 \u00b1 1.2 mL/kg in NAVA and 5.5\u00b10.8 mL/ kg in baseline; p = 0.364), RR (24 \u00b1 7 in NAVA and 25 \u00b1 7 in baseline; p = 0.946), or Paw (20 \u00b1 4 cmH 2 O in NAVA and 23 \u00b1 4 cmH 2 O in baseline; p = 0.051). The median P/F ratio was similar for both modes, 216 (172-281) vs. 217 (167-266), p = 0.765. One patient who presented apneas on the first hour of NAVA3h was excluded from this assessment. Mean V T was stable and remained at protective levels over NAVA3h (Fig. 4 ).",

Patients who could be ventilated with approximately 6 mL/kg in PSV could also be safely ventilated in NAVA. We included patients on the three categories of ARDS, with a median of 3 days of MV. On the day of the study, the median P/F was still low, 190, and the two patients with P/F above 300 had received recruitment maneuvers and were on high PEEP (13 and 15 cmH 2 O). Tidal volume was similar in PSV and NAVA and within protective values for the 14 patients who completed the protocol. However, we had to interrupt the protocol and resume deep sedation for five patients (25%) who had strong inspiratory efforts resulting in V T \u2265 8 mL/kg, even with low levels of PS. Our concern was that strong inspiratory efforts and high tidal volumes could contribute to VILI [37] . In such cases, patients may benefit from the use of controlled ventilation and sedation to avoid further injury caused by MV [6] .",

The respiratory drive was similar in both modes for the 14 patients enrolled, as indicated by the mean values of EAdi/TIn and EAdi. Paw was greater in NAVA than in PSV, despite titration of NAVA level to generate the same Paw in PSV. That happened because Paw in NAVA varies with EAdi, in contrast to PSV, where it is set. However, Paw remained within protective levels in both modes and this difference did not translate into more assistance in NAVA compared to PSV, since RR, V T and EAdi were similar in both modes [21, 38, 39] . The P/F ratio was higher in NAVA when compared with PSV, but the difference was not clinically relevant. The incidence of the asynchrony was relatively low in our study. AI was greater than 10% in only two patients in both PSV and NAVA, which is considered clinically important and associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation [31, 32, 40] . This finding may be related to the fact that most patients were still sedated during the study and that they were ventilated with low tidal volumes, which may have prevented the occurrence of ineffective triggering [41] the most common type of asynchrony [40, 42] . Triggering delay was the most common type of asynchrony in our study, and it was significantly reduced in NAVA compared to PSV. Since triggering delay greater than 0.15 s may cause considerable discomfort [26, 43] and is easily measured with the NAVA catheter [44] [45] [46] , we report its value but do not include it in the computation of AI to allow comparison of our results with other studies.",

In addition, each ventilatory mode was studied for a short period. Therefore, more studies are necessary to test the feasibility and safety of using NAVA continuously in patients with ARDS to deliver protective MV. Second, we opted to interrupt the protocol for 25% of patients due to strong inspiratory efforts that prevented us from maintaining low V T in PSV. This choice was made to address a safety issue, since there is uncertainty about deleterious effects of strong inspiratory efforts at the early phase of ARDS. Since the patients had already been randomized, our power to detect differences between NAVA and PSV was reduced. Therefore, our conclusions about the safety of NAVA and PSV to deliver protective MV cannot be extrapolated to all patients with ARDS. And third, we used the EAdi to identify patients' inspiratory efforts and Filled diamonds represent the mean tidal volume for predicted body weight of 13 patients who completed the 3 h of NAVA and bars represent standard deviation. V T mL/kg: tidal volume for predicted body weight asynchrony events; therefore, inspiratory efforts initiated by accessory muscles were not detected, which might impact asynchrony detection. In addition, EAdi is a processed signal, which may have impacted precision.",

These findings suggest that using partial ventilatory assistance in ARDS can be used as part of a protective ventilation strategy, with potential benefits of less sedation and less muscle paralysis.",
