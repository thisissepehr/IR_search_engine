            "text": "A dual-mode molecular beacon on a multiplexed substrate has been developed and applied to the measurement of unlabeled human viral RNA. The detection system is based on a combined surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and fluorescent molecular beacon assay that is assembled on Nanobarcodes TM particles. In this assay, a molecular beacon probe terminated with a fluorescent Raman label dye is conjugated to the metallic Nanobarcodes TM particles. The molecular beacon probe is a single-stranded oligonucleotide that has been designed with a hairpin structure that holds the dye at 3'-end close to the particle surface when the probe is attached through a 5'thiol group. In this configuration, the SERS spectrum of the label was obtained and its fluorescence quenched because the dye is in very close proximity to a noble metal surface with nanoscale features (Nanobarcodes TM particles). The SERS signal decreased and the fluorescence signal increased when target viral RNAwas captured by this molecular beacon probe. In addition, a hepatitis C virus reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (HCV RT-PCR) product was detected using this dual-mode beacon. The development of a multiplexed, label-free assay system with the reassurance offered by detection of two distinctly separate signals offers significant benefits for rapid molecular diagnostics.",

Cotton's study of cytochrome c and myoglobin [3] helped set the stage for the recent explosion of work that includes the detection of anthrax [4] , cancer diagnostics [5] , a glucose biosensor [6] , DNA and RNA detection [7] [8] [9] [10] , protein immunoassays [11] , and cell labeling [12] . Several characteristics of SERS make it an attractive method for the detection of biomolecules. Because of the uniqueness of molecular Raman spectra, it is possible to detect several species simultaneously (multiplexed detection) [7, 13] . As Raman scattering (and SERS) is not inherently susceptible to photobleaching, extended exposures to optical excitation sources are possible without signal degradation [14] . The higher sensitivity and lower detection limit, due to the SERS enhancement and real-time response, are particularly useful for a quantitative assay, and the detection of single molecules by SERS indicates the potential for measurements with very high sensitivity [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "Fluorescent molecular beacons were first developed in 1996 [18] . The molecular beacon is a single-stranded \"loop-and-stem\" DNA oligonucleotide carrying both a fluorochrome and a nonfluorescent quencher chromophore at opposite ends of the strand. In the absence of a complementary strand, the two ends are near each other due to intramolecular bonding. When the loop binds to a complementary nucleic acid target, the molecule changes its conformation removing the fluorochrome from the vicinity of the quencher and resulting in unquenched fluorescence. Quenching in the molecular beacon is typically achieved with the nonfluorescent chromophore DABCYL (4-((-4-(dimethylamino)-phenyl)-azo)-benzoic acid). However, this concept has also been adapted to metal nanoparticles where the metal surface acts to quench the fluorescence rather than an organic moiety [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Metals can efficiently quench emission from dyes located within a few nanometers of their surface [24] . For this work, we have used Nanobarcodes T M particles (NBC) as our metal surface. These particles have been shown to have a fluorescence quenching efficiency around 89-94% with the dyes TAMRA and Texas red [22] and 1.4 nm Au colloid particles have demonstrated a quenching efficiency of 98-99% [19] . These results indicate that metal surfaces can function even better than a nonfluorescent chromophore such as DABCYL [19] .",

A single NBC is about 300 nm wide and 6-9 I.tm in length. NBC are synthesized by sequential electrochemical deposition of metal ions into templates with uniformly sized pores [25] [26] [27] . Coding of the 9-p.m length with 11 stripes of two metals (silver and gold) could create 1,056 different striping patterns, giving a huge multiplexing capability. This concept has already been applied to multiplexed SNP genotyping [28] and a multiplexed fluorescence molecular beacon for viral RNA detection [22, 23] . Our new dualmode design utilizes a molecular beacon probe with a hairpin structure, which holds the dye at the 3' end close to the nanoparticle surface when the probe is assembled to it by a 5'-thiol group. Fluorescence from the dye is quenched when it is in proximity to the surface of metal nanoparticles such as NBC [22, 23] . On the other hand, SERS spectra are observed when the dye is held near the surface of the metal (Ag or Au).",

To understand the SERS signal intensity from each particle, we carefully diluted the hybridized NBC and focused onto the slide with a 100\u00d7 objective using the Renishaw Raman microscope. In this way, single particles could readily be resolved and isolated for confocal SERS measurements. Under these conditions, a SERS signal could be detected from single NBC in PBS solution (Fig. 4) . Using a previously determined quenching efficiency of 87% for Cy5 on an NBC [22] , we can estimate that not less than 87% of the Cy5 molecules are in very close proximity to the surface (assuming 100% fluorescence quenching of all molecules near the surface). If the per molecule fluorescence quenching efficiency at the surface is less than 100%, then a larger number of the Cy5 molecules must be at the surface. Therefore, we estimate that between 34,800 (87% of 40,000) and 40,000 molecules are available to generate the SERS signal from a single particle; a number that can be readily detected. (Fig. 4) .",

PBS buffer was used as a negative control and a SARS sequence oligo (10 ~M) as a noncomplementary target control. Upon binding to the target DNA sequence, a large decrease in SERS signal is measured. With no target (PBS) present, the SERS signal is relatively unchanged and much larger.

With the SERS beacon method, a potential criticism could be that the observed decrease in signal, credited to the hybridization to the target probe, could also be obtained by simply stripping the dye-labeled oligo from the surface of the particle. As a fluorescent molecular beacon on NBCs has already been demonstrated [22] , we decided to use the fluorescence quenching response of the dye-labeled oligo to confirm that oligo remained attached to the NBC. but very low SERS when the HCV target was present. This observation was also confirmed by quantitative analysis of both the Raman and fluorescence signals (Fig. 5d) . The power of a dual modality SERS and fluorescent probe is shown by the fact that the fluorescence signal increased and SERS decreased when the HCV target was present. Thus, two measurements can be used to verify that the assay is giving an accurate result. This dual-detection modality could become a valuable in-built control for rapid diagnostic tests, while the NBC substrates can be used to multiplex the test and detect many targets simultaneously.",

The SERS quenching efficiency was about 72% (Fig. 7b, ( 1 is an improvement over that previously reported [9] . One of the explanations for this is the fact that the double-stranded PCR amplicon was digested before hybridization in our case (see Materials and Methods for detail) to have complementary single-stranded DNA as the target, thus, increasing the hybridization efficiency. We confirmed this by comparing the efficiency of double and single-stranded DNA using a fluorescent molecular beacon (data not shown).
