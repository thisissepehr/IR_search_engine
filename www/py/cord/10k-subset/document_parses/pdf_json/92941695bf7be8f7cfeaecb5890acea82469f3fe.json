Social distancing is an important component of behavioral response, though analyses have been limited by a lack of behavioral data.

Methods: We use data on variation in home television viewing as a proxy for variation in time spent in the home and, by extension, contact. This behavioral proxy is imperfect but appealing since information on a rich and representative sample is collected using consistent techniques across time and most major cities. We study the April-May 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 in Central Mexico and examine the dynamic behavioral response in aggregate and contrast the observed patterns of various demographic subgroups.

In parallel to standard vaccination efforts, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are a critical part of the management toolkit [5] [6] [7] . In particular, NPIs become even more relevant in the context of emerging infectious diseases when the availability of a vaccine may be substantially delayed. Chief among NPIs are strategies for enhancing social distancing, whether privately initiated or policy-directed (e.g., closing of schools, businesses and public events) [8] . While behavioral NPIs appear promising, it is important to evaluate empirically their efficacy since they can be costly [9] and could have unintended consequences, such as leading to a net increase in the long-run number of cases or increasing the total cost of the epidemic and policy response [10, 11] . The potential for individual response to disease risk and policy presents a challenge for the measurement of the infectivity of a pathogen and design of policy directed social distancing [12, 13] .

Outside of the post-intervention dip, \u0394 t dropped below \u221210% on only one other day. As further evidence that the dip was likely not a coincident random event, we find that this dip persisted at 5% below the non-NPI period mean for four consecutive days-there are no other instances in the data when \u0394 t falls below 95% of the mean for more than a single day. While the causal mechanism behind these dynamics is not known with certainty, one possibility is that this multi-day period of suppressed in-home activity compensated for forgone social and commercial activities from earlier in the intervention period.
