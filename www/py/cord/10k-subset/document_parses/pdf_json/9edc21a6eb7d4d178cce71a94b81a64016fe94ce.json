This study presents maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), and the chloroplast DNA trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region, and trnE-trnT intergenic spacer region sequences. The ITS and cpDNA data sets strongly support the monophyly of a Beslerieae/Napeantheae clade; an Episcieae clade; a Gesnerieae clade; a Gloxinieae clade minus Sinningia, Sinningia relatives, and Gloxinia sarmentiana; and a Sinningia/Paliavana/Vanhouttea clade. This is the first study to provide strong statistical support for these tribes/clades. These analyses suggest that Sinningia and relatives should be considered as a separate tribe. Additionally, generic relationships are explored, including the apparent polyphyly of Gloxinia. Chromosome number changes are minimized on the proposed phylogeny, with the exception of the n \u03ed 11 taxa of the Gloxinieae. Scaly rhizomes appear to have been derived once in the Gloxinieae sensu stricto. The number of derivations of the inferior ovary is unclear: either there was one derivation with a reversal to a superior ovary in the Episcieae, or there were multiple independent derivations of the inferior ovary.",

            "text": "The Gesneriaceae Dumort. are a moderate-sized tropical family of flowering plants comprising \u03f3133 genera and \u03fe2500 species (Brummitt, 1992; Wentsai et al., 1998) . This family is a member of the order Lamiales (sensu Olmstead et al., 1993; Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 1998) and is distinguished from other members of the order by a suite of characters: five-lobed corollas, parietal placentation, unilocular bicarpellate ovaries, a pair-flowered cyme inflorescence, minute seeds, and presence of endosperm in the seeds of many taxa (Cronquist, 1981; Wiehler, 1983; Smith et al., 1997b) . Orderwide phylogenetic studies have suggested that the Gesneriaceae form a separate lineage from the presumed nearest relatives, such as the Acanthaceae, Bignoniaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Veronicaceae (Oxelman, Backlund, and Bremer, 1999; Olmstead et al., 2000 Olmstead et al., , 2001 . ZIMMER ET AL.-PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS IN THE GESNERIOIDEAE 1997a, b; Smith and Carroll, 1997; Smith and Atkinson, 1998) . Lack of resolution and low statistical support (i.e., low bootstrap values) in these studies have prevented researchers from making a confident assessment of tribal and generic relationships. This study presents maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of nrDNA ITS region, and the chloroplast DNA trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, and trnE-trnT intergenic spacer region sequences. These analyses are used to address three primary questions: (1) Does the current classification of the Gesnerioideae proposed by Burtt and Wiehler (1995) reflect inferred phylogenetic relationships?",

Skog] L.P. Kvist & L.E. Skog) . Outgroup sampling was restricted to Aeschynanthus W.Jack and Streptocarpus Lindl. (subfamily Cyrtandroideae; Burtt and Wiehler, 1995;  species and voucher information has been archived at the Botanical Society of America website at http://ajbsupp. botany.org/) because previous studies have supported the monophyly of the Gesnerioideae (Smith and Carroll, 1997; Smith and Atkinson, 1998) . The ingroup comprised 57 species representing all five tribes of the Gesnerioideae, including 16 genera of tribe Gloxinieae, 12 genera of tribe Episcieae, 3 genera of tribe Beslerieae, the 1 genus of tribe Napeantheae, and 2 genera of tribe Gesnerieae (http://ajbsupp.botany.org/). Some greenhouse plants included in this study died before being vouchered (marked ''not vouchered'' in the table at http://ajbsupp.botany.org/), but their identity was verified by L. E. Skog. Some of these unvouchered taxa are Gesneria L. and Rhytidophyllum Mart. specimens obtained from the Montreal Botanical Garden, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Whether they have been vouchered there is unknown. The sample labeled Rhytidophyllum vernicosum Urb. & Ekman may not be that species but a closely related undescribed species. Until additional samples of this collection can be obtained, its exact disposition cannot be verified. Regardless, in the molecular trees, the phylogenetic position of the sample identified as R. vernicosum is where either R. vernicosum or the undescribed species of Rhytidophyllum would be expected to occur. DNA sequencing-DNA was isolated using standard CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) extraction methods (Doyle and Doyle, 1987) or the Qiagen DNeasy DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA). Templates of the nrDNA ITS region were prepared using the primers ITS5HP (5\u0408-GGA AGG AGA AGT CGT AAC AAG G-3\u0408; Suh et al., 1993) and ITS4 (5\u0408-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3\u0408; White et al., 1990) . The chloroplast spacer regions were amplified using the primers trnLc (5\u0408-CGA AAT CGG TAG ACG CTA CG-3\u0408) and trnLf (5\u0408-ATT TGA ACT GGT GAC ACG AG-3\u0408) for the trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer (igs; Taberlet et al., 1991) , respectively, and trnE (5\u0408-GCC TCC TTG AAA GAG AGA TG-3\u0408) and trnTr (5\u0408-TAC CAC TGA GTT AAA AGG GC -3\u0408) for the trnE-trnT igs (Doyle et al., 1992) . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications followed the procedures described by Baldwin (1992) , Baldwin et al. (1995) , and Roalson and Friar (2000) utilizing Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Mg HotBeads (3.0 mM; Lumitekk, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) were used with recalcitrant templates. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel in 1\u03eb TBE (pH 8.3) buffer, stained with ethidium bromide to confirm a single product, and purified using the PEG (polyethylene glycol 8000) precipitation procedure (Johnson and Soltis, 1995) . Direct cycle sequencing of purified template DNAs followed the manufacturer's specifications, using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Se-quencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) and the PCR primers. Sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems Model 377 Automated DNA Sequencing System (PE Biosystems).",

The cpDNA spacers were automatically combined, as they are both part of the nonrecombining chloroplast and any differences between them are likely due to homoplasy rather than separate histories. With the partition homogeneity test, 10 000 replicate data partitions were run (heuristic search; simple addition; no branch swapping), excluding constant characters. This test measures character congruence by comparing tree-length differences among trees derived from resampled data partitions of the combined data sets and trees derived from the defined data partition (i.e., nrDNA vs. cpDNA). Differences in branch support between the different data sets were assessed by comparing jackknife support values for branches in conflict. Conflicting branch structure that was well supported (jk \u03fe 67%) as being different between the ITS and cpDNA data sets was considered to be in conflict, while branch structure that was different, but not well supported by one or both data sets, was not considered to represent conflict. The ITS and cpDNA data sets were analyzed in separate maximum likelihood (ML) analyses based on the likelihood ratio test as implemented by Modeltest 2.1 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) .",

The alignment of the ITS region was somewhat difficult, particularly between the outgroups, members of the Beslerieae and Napeantheae, and the rest of the subfamily. Multiple alignments were explored (data not shown) without major changes to tree topology. Two regions of the nrDNA spacers (a 53-bp region of ITS1, exclusion set 1, and a 66-bp region of ITS2, exclusion set 2) were particularly difficult to align with confidence.

Exclusion set 1 resulted in a nearly identical support tree. Exclusion set 2 and the combined exclusion of sets 1 and 2 resulted in the drop of statistical support of the association of Napeanthus with the Beslerieae clade to below 50% and reduced the statistical support for the pairing of the Gesnerieae clade and the Gloxinieae clade to \u03fd50%.

The likelihood ratio test explores differences in the model of nucleotide change, not necessarily topological differences supported by the data sets. Additionally, many authors consider simultaneous analysis of all data to be the most effective way to study evolutionary descent (Thornton and DeSalle [2000] and references therein). In this study, the incongruences between the data sets do not generally involve well-supported branches. In fact, the relationships that this study is most interested in addressing (tribal relationships) have the same topology in the separate analyses.

The species in Group 2 were included in two sections [Pentarhaphia (Lindl.) Fritsch, G. ventricosa; Dittanthera (G. Don) L.E. Skog, G. pedunculosa] of Gesneria. Both sections include species with similar habit (erect, shrubby, resinous plants) but are different in floral characteristics (Skog, 1976) . Group 3 is more problematic from a morphological point of view, as it includes G. citrina, a species that had always been included among typical species of Gesneria. This species is a pendent plant in the wild, with small plane leaves and bright yellow tubular flowers, very different from the typical shrubby species of Rhytidophyllum with large bullate or areolate leaves and red, green, or rarely yellow campanulate corollas (Skog, 1976) .",

Gloxinia perennis, Anodiscus, and Koellikeria share a raceme-like flowering stem (''inflorescence''), with flowers solitary in the axils of strongly reduced leaves, and the grouping of these three taxa is strongly supported (jk \u03ed 95%). Within this clade, Gloxinia is strongly supported as paraphyletic (jk \u03ed 95%). These data might suggest that Seemannia should be recognized as a distinct genus. Pollen stainability of intergeneric hybrids was a strong impetus for the combination of Seemannia with Gloxinia; crossing attempts between Anodiscus and other genera of the Gloxinieae have not been reported (for information on crossing studies see Wiehler [1976] ). One cross has been successful between Gloxinia perennis and Koellikeria erinoides (Roberts, 1985) , but no indication of pollen viability was offered. Additionally, while some pollen viability (deduced from partial fertility of the hybrids) was found in crosses between Seemannia and Gloxinia, pollen stainability was much less than that among other congeneric crosses: 19% was found in Seemannia latifolia Fritsch \u03eb Gloxinia perennis and 20% in Seemannia latifolia \u03eb Gloxinia lindeniana (Regel) Fritsch vs. 79% in Gloxinia perennis \u03eb G. gymnostoma Griseb. and 100% in Nautilocalyx panamensis (Seem.) Seem. \u03eb N. villosus (Kunth & Bouch\u00e9) Sprague (Wiehler, 1976) . While many interspecific crosses resulted in 0% pollen stainability, some did not: 5-8% was found in Diastema vexans H.E. Moore \u03eb Kohleria spicata (Kunth) Oerst., 0-11% in Koellikeria erinoides \u03eb Kohleria spicata, and 8% in Seemannia latifolia \u03eb Kohleria spicata (Wiehler, 1976) , but these crosses with partial pollen stainability were not subsumed into one genus.",

The ITS and combined analyses place G. sarmentiana as sister to a combined Episcieae/Sinningia clade (Figs. 1  and 3) , while the cpDNA analysis places G. sarmentiana as sister to the Sinningia clade (Fig. 2) . In either case, this species is not closely related to the other members of Gloxinia we sequenced. Interestingly, G. sarmentiana is somewhat separated geographically from most of the rest of Gloxinia (in southern Brazil vs. the Andes mountains for most of Gloxinia), and has a different storage organ type than typical Gloxinia species (it has a ''lumpy rhizome'' that is similar to tubers on a rhizome vs. a scaly rhizome for the rest of Gloxinia; Fritsch, 1900; J. K. Boggan, personal observation) . Additional sampling of other Gloxinia species in southern Brazil may determine the extent of this separate lineage. Curiously, while Gloxinia sarmentiana is outside of the geographic range of typical Gloxinia, most of the species of Sinningia also occur in southern Brazil, a fact that may support phylogenetic relatedness among these taxa. Chromosome evolution-Unlike the situation in Cyrtandroideae, chromosome number is fairly stable in the Gesnerioideae (Skog, 1984; Burtt and Wiehler, 1995) . Base chromosome number is fairly congruent with the phylogenetic hypotheses presented here (Fig. 6 ). All n \u03ed 14 taxa (Gesnerieae) form a strongly supported clade (jk \u03ed 100%; Figs. 3 and 6), the n \u03ed 12 genera form a strongly supported clade (jk \u03ed 100%; Figs. 3 and 6), the n \u03ed 9 taxa (most of Episcieae) form a clade with n \u03ed 8 genera (Codonanthe and Nematanthus) that is nested within the n \u03ed 9 clade as a strongly supported clade (jk \u03ed 100%; Figs. 3 and 6) . The n \u03ed 13 genera do not form a monophyletic group due to the separation of the Sinningia clade from the primary Gloxinieae clade and the close relationship of Pearcea (n \u03ed 11) with Kohleria (n \u03ed 13; Figs. 3 and 6). The other n \u03ed 11 genera (Achimenes, Moussonia, and Niphaea) do not form a clade, but are scattered among poorly supported branches holding the major groups of Gloxinieae together (Figs. 3 and 6) . These data suggest that while chromosome complement across the Gesnerioideae is relatively stable, there are more changes in chromosome complement within the Gloxinieae than previously postulated.",

Scaly rhizomes appear to be synapomorphic for the Gloxinieae tribe (Fig. 7A) . Tubers have arisen at least twice: once in the Episcieae genera Chrysothemis and Nautilocalyx and again in most species of the genus Sinningia (Fig. 7A) . While traditionally considered a member of the Gloxinieae, Gloxinia sarmentiana does not have the typical scaly rhizome, but instead has what we refer to as a ''lumpy'' rhizome. This lumpy rhizome is similar in some regards to the tubers produced on underground rhizomes found in some species of Sinningia not yet sequenced (S. curtiflora (Malme) Chautems, S. richii Clayberg, and S. tubiflora (Hook.) Fritsch). With additional sampling of Gloxinia species from southern Brazil and species of Sinningia with tubers on rhizomes, a stronger relationship between these groups may be found, as suggested by the cpDNA analyses (Figs. 2 and 5) .",

The ITS sequences of the Episcieae included in this study provide statistical support to the monophyly of the Episcieae (jk \u03ed 81%) as well as major clades within the tribe, while those in Smith (2000b) do not (bootstrap \u03ed 6%). In the exploration of this issue, we note that all of the sequences in GenBank from the previous ITS study (Smith, 2000b) included a large percentage of ambiguously called bases (designated as an ''N''). As a means of more directly investigating these questions, comparisons were made between sequences of two species (Gesneria christii and Niphaea oblonga Lindl.) where the identical collection was sequenced for ITS in Smith (2000b) and this study respectively) . There are significant differences in the sequences of the two species as cited in GenBank (G. christii, GBAN-AF206237; N. oblonga, GBAN-AF 206242) and the sequences produced in this study. The Gesneria christii raw sequence in GenBank differs from our sequence by 2.5% and \u03f323% of the sequence is designated by an ''N'' (or nucleic acid \u03ed unclear). Similarly, the raw sequence of Niphaea oblonga differs from our sequence by 3.8% and includes 22% Ns. In order to align the GenBank sequences to our data set, inferred gaps were often, but not always, necessary in our sequences where Ns are present in the GenBank sequences. In some cases, large amounts of nucleotide polymorphism have been found in ITS within individuals of Gesneriaceae species (Denduangboripant and Cronk, 2000) . This does not appear to be the situation here, as our sequences were unambiguous and clean, with rare instances of single-base polymorphisms, but no indication of significantly different ITS copies being present.",

Our sequences were obtained using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit run on an Applied Biosystems Model 377 Automated sequencer with full overlap along both strands (PE Biosystems). This method of sequencing produces clean sequencing chromatograms, which, when both strands are sequenced, provide for confident base calling. The Smith (2000b) paper cites Smith et al. (1997b) for ITS sequencing methodologies, which were apparently the same as for the previous ndhF studies and utilized the Silver Sequence method (Promega). While this is an accepted method of sequencing, it does not provide for computer construction of consensus sequences from multiple strands (such as the Sequencher software package), which minimizes error in sequence reading and archiving. The explanation for the high frequency of missing data (Ns) is unclear. Smith (2000b) indicated that insertion/deletion (indel) events were coded as missing data, which could explain the Ns. However, Gen-Bank notes that the sequences were not submitted as an aligned dataset, so there is no reason for indel events to be marked in the sequences. Additionally, the presence of the Ns aligned with our gaps do not explain the divergence between Smith's (2000b) and our sequences. Gaps do not contribute to uncorrected pairwise divergence estimates, so it is only sites where bases are called in both sequences that contribute to this measure.",

Previous studies have suggested these clades were monophyletic but poorly supported, paraphyletic, or even polyphyletic (Smith, 1996 (Smith, , 2000a Smith and Carroll, 1997; Smith et al., 1997a, b; Smith and Atkinson, 1998) . With the exception of the distribution of the n \u03ed 11 taxa, the phylogenetic hypotheses presented here are also congruent with a minimal number of chromosomal changes in the subfamily. There are still problems with generic circumscription in some lineages (e.g., Gloxinia). While the Gesnerioideae tribal circumscriptions of Burtt and Wiehler (1995) largely agree with the phylogenies presented here, this study provides evidence that Sinningia, Paliavana, and Vanhouttea might be best dealt with as a tribe separate from the Gloxinieae. Additionally, Gloxinia sarmentiana may represent an additional major lineage of the Gesnerioideae. The molecular phylogenetic hypotheses do not completely agree with the traditional explanation for the evolution of some morphological characters (e.g., ovary position). The nodes placing the Sinningia clade and Gloxinia sarmentiana sister to the Episcieae rather than sister to the Gloxinieae and Gesnerieae needs to be explored to resolve this issue.",
