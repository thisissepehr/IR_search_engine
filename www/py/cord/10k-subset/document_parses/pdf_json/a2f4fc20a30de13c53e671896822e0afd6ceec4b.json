Cryoablation-related complications were also observed. Atelectasis in the right lung base developed in 4 patients with right liver lobe cryoablation because of injury to the right lung and right hemidiaphragm due to the close proximity of the liver to the right lung. Two Patients developed mild form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at 3 and 9 days after the cryoablation.

One potential candidate is the new group of antiangiogenic agents that have been developed to block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling and subsequent tumor angiogenesis [15] . In this study, all patients received sorafenib orally 400 mg twice daily on a continuous dosing schedule at the second day after percutaneous cryoablation.

A recent phase 2 open-label study of single agent sorafenib in treating advanced HCC with similar study populations like us showed 8% response rate and 18% disease-stabilization rate [17] . The higher disease-stabilization rate and DCR rate observed in our study may be contributed to the necrosis induced by cryoablation and also sorafenib. Although RECIST [10] were utilized to measure tumor response, it may not be the best indicator for the treatment of this study, and enhances tumor stability rather than tumor shrinkage [18] . Cryoablation can induce coagulation necrosis. In addition, Sorafenib is also better related to the tumor necrosis documented in many patients, as has been demonstrated in studies with other biological agents, such as sunitinib and imatinib. New response criteria combining tumor density on contrast enhanced CT, as a measure of tumor necrosis, with conventional dimension measurement will probably allow better characterization of cryoablation and sorafenib response in HCC [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 887, "end": 891, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1372, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Enhancement of the efficacy of sorafenib by its use in combination with cryoablation also has been observed with a median TTP of 7.6 months and a median OS of 12.2 months.

This is expected, as the study population in our study had poor overall prognosis because of advanced tumors. In patients achieved PR, the duration of sorafenib therapy was 7.2 months whereas in 34 patients showing the best SD responses, the median duration of sorafenib therapy was 5.1 months (P=0.032). This interaction is likely mediated by the well-documented antiangiogenic properties of sorafenib. A reduction in blood flow could eliminate heterogeneous \"heat sinks\" that can occur in tumors of all sizes, thereby improving uniformity of cold deposition during cryoablation and potentially reducing the rate of incomplete treatment. TACE may also decrease the blood flow to the tumor. One advantage of performing TACE before cryoablation is a possible reduction in postoperative bleeding, as well as an increase in the rate of tumor ablation [21] . But in this study, there were no significant differences in terms of clinical benefits and OS between TACE and non-TACE before cryoablation procedure.

The commonest liver function derangement observed was the change in transaminase levels. The majority of the liver derangements induced by cryoablation and sorafenib were transient and improved after stopping sorafenib. Furthermore, there are recent reports regarding the reactivation of hepatitis B infection in chronic hepatitis B carriers who received targeted therapy alone for the treatment of underlying malignancy [24, 25] . Thus, it is possible that the administration of sorafenib will likewise lead to the reactivation of the underlying hepatitis B infection and result in worsening liver function, because most patients with advanced HCC in Asia are chronic hepatitis B carriers. In this study, the HBV infection rate was as high as 80.8%.
