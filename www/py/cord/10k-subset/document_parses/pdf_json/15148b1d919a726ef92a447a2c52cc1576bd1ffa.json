Case reports indicate an association between infections with influenza A viruses and reduced reproductive performance, although it has been difficult to experimentally reproduce the clinical outcome of poor reproductive performance. The aim of the present longitudinal field study was to compare the reproductive performance parameters before and after the implementation of vaccination against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Therefore, farm-specific data of 137 sow herds in Germany, including 60,153 sows, as well as the clinical presentation of the infection were surveyed via questionnaire. Furthermore, average performance parameters (return to oestrus rate, abortion rate, stillbirth rate, number of piglets born alive per litter, preweaning mortality rate and number of piglets weaned per sow per year) were recorded for 6 months before vaccination and 6 months after completion of primary vaccination. Results: In 79.8% of the farms, the clinical presentation of the infection was characterised by a reduced reproductive performance. These findings were confirmed by analysis of the performance parameters, which revealed a significant decline in the return to oestrus rate (p < 0.001), abortion rate (p < 0.001) and preweaning mortality rate (p = 0.023) and a significant increase of the number in piglets born alive (p = 0.001) and piglets weaned per sow per year (p < 0.001) after immunisation. The stillbirth rate did not change significantly. Conclusion: The present study represents the first attempt to demonstrate the association of influenza A virus infection, vaccination and the alteration in reproductive performance parameters, investigating a large number of cases. The results show that by vaccinating against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, an improvement in reproductive performance can be achieved in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Additionally, the large number of herds that were affected by poor reproductive performance after infection with the aforementioned virus confirms the assumption of an association between pandemic influenza A virus and reproductive losses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In April 2009, the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in humans and, shortly after, provoked the first pandemic of the twenty-first century [1, 2] .

An involvement in reproductive disorders, such as return to oestrus, abortion or small litters, is assumed, although a causal link could not be shown in all studies [12, 13] . Numerous case reports as well as a case-control study on a naive Norwegian pig subpopulation describe the emergence of reproductive disorders in context with the infection with influenza A virus [14] [15] [16] [17] . In contrast, there are few experimental studies investigating the pathogenesis and the clinical presentation of the reproductive losses [18] [19] [20] . The clinical presentation was not reproducible in these studies. Thus, a validation of a causal link between the virus infection and inadequate reproductive performance is still lacking.

The results of the survey concerning the clinical signs of the infection with pandemic IAV coincide with the observations of numerous experimental studies and case reports [4, 11, 21] . Interestingly, in the present study, reproductive disorders were present in nearly 80% of the assessed farms. A connection between reduced reproductive performance and infection with IAV is described in the literature, but data confirming a causal link is lacking. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of reproductive disorders subsequent to infection with IAV is not definitively determined. Alterations of the maternal immune system during pregnancy can result in an increased likelihood of influenza virus infection [22] . The few studies examining the effect of infection with IAV during pregnancy were conducted mainly with rodent models [22, 23] . Thus, interpretation of these studies is hampered by histological dissimilarities of the rodent placenta and the of swine placenta [24] . It is assumed that reproductive disorders due to influenza virus infections are indirectly caused by systemic consequences of the infection [25] , particularly by fever and immunological reactions leading to hormonal imbalances [26, 27] . An increase in proinflammatory gene expression after infection with influenza virus results in the release of inflammatory cytokines [28, 29] . The pathological consequence of the infection may be reduced progesterone synthesis in the corpus luteum in pregnant animals [23] .

With the exception of three farms, improvement of at least one reproductive parameter was observed after vaccination. However, the alteration of each parameter differed between farms. These individual levels of influenza affectedness of the single parameter can be explained by various assumptions. There may be different IAV infection time points affecting not all sows in all different gestational states, resulting in different clinical outcomes apparent in the reproductive parameters. Perhaps in the three farms with no improvement in reproductive performance after vaccination IAV infection either remained subclinical or manifested in respiratory disease rather than in reproductive disorders. Furthermore, as it is described that the infection dynamic of IAV can vary from endemic to short epidemic patterns [42] , it could be assumed that the assessed time periods did not include the time of clinical disease in the mentioned farms. Additionally, the presence of stress or other immunosuppressive agents might have adversely affected the onset of immunity. After all, vaccine management and handling procedures were not monitored, so lack of compliance might be a possible cause as well. The analysis of the effect of prevaccination of some herds against other influenza subtypes revealed that the number of piglets weaned per sow and year improved significantly (p = 0.016) more in herds pre-vaccinating sows than in herds that only vaccinated against the pandemic IAV. Repeated vaccination of pigs with antigens of different IAV strains can induce slight cross-reactions in neutralisation tests with pandemic influenza viruses [43] ; however, cross-protective immunity cannot be achieved [44] .

The field study was conducted in accordance with paragraph 11 section 1 of the German animal health law (formerly paragraph 17 c of the law on epizootic diseases).

The reasons for exclusion were factors that could bias the data, such as restocking of the sow herds, depopulation and repopulation, lack of vaccine compliance or change in the internal biosecurity as well as external biosecurity measures.

In detail, the return to oestrus rate, abortion rate, stillbirth rate, piglets born alive per litter, preweaning mortality rate and number of piglets weaned per sow per year were assessed based on routinely recorded production data that were obtained monthly whenever possible. However, the information value of the monthly data was limited due to differing batch farrowing intervals that would distort the monthly data. Therefore, in the current analyses, the data were reduced for every farm to two data points summarising the two time periods (6 months before implementation of the vaccine and 6 months after completion of primary vaccination) to ensure comparability between farms. The farms were categorised by means of the return to oestrus rate before vaccination. The categories were chosen by the following benchmarks: return to oestrus rate < 10% (category 1), return to oestrus rate \u2265 10% and < 20% (category 2) and return to oestrus rate \u2265 20% (category 3), based on a literature review and industry reports characterising average German performance data [53] [54] [55] .
