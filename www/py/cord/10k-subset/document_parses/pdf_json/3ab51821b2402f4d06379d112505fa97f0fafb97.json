Since 1996, there have been three significant human outbreaks and 164 confirmed human infections with avian influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry has reached epidemic proportions in eight Southeast Asian countries, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of chickens through infection or culling, and huge economic losses. Mutation of the genome and/or genetic reassortment resulting in antigenic shift in avian viruses sets the stage for a highly pathogenic strain with pandemic potential to emerge. It has been estimated that the next influenza pandemic will result in 207,000 deaths and 734,000 hospitalizations in the United States alone [1] .

Influenza A is the only type of veterinary significance. The virus is enveloped and contains a genome of eight RNA segments. The segmented genome allows viruses from different species to recombine RNA segments, resulting in reassorted virus with surface proteins to which humans are nonimmune. These major changes in glycoproteins, called antigenic shifts, are associated with epidemics and pandemics. Minor changes, or antigenic drifts, are usually associated with annual outbreaks. Antigenic drift results from high mutation rates in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes caused by the poor proofreading ability of RNA polymerase, resulting in amino acid substitutions and quasispecies with optimal chances for environmental adaptation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virology"}, {"text": "Influenza A has two major antigenic surface proteins embedded in the membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are essential for viral attachment and cellular release. HA enables attachment to new cells via binding to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cells. HA monomers are cleaved by trypsin-like enzymes, which results in a conformational change that activates membrane fusion and entry into acidified endosomes. Cleavability and invasion are impaired by having a carbohydrate side chain at this cleavage site and enhanced by having multiple basic residues directly upstream from this site. HA variability, including extensive post-translational glycosylation, allows evasion of host immune responses.

TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 peaked later, after symptoms and viral shedding had decreased [11] . Patients with H5N1 disease studied in 2003 had very high levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-induced protein-10 and monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 . Levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), and IL-8 were not higher than in uncomplicated, non-H5N1 influenza.

H5N1 was isolated only from the respiratory tract of patients, suggesting that high levels of cytokines generated in response to contain the virus caused the widespread disease, with limited viral detection [12] . H5N1 also induced a higher transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-\u03b1, as compared with H3N2 and H1N1 in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. The levels of TNF-\u03b1 were comparable to levels in macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide [13\u2022] . Pigs infected with H1N1 carrying the NS gene from H5N1 had more severe disease and a longer course, suggesting that the NS gene confers resistance to IFNs and TNF-\u03b1, resulting in viral escape from their natural antiviral effects [14] .
