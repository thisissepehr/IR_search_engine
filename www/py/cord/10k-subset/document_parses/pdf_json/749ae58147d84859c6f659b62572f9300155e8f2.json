These patients were selected for intra-arterial treatment for several reasons. First, intrahepatic tumor progression is the cause of death in over 80% of the roughly 50 000 patients dying with colorectal carcinoma in the United States every year, and it is estimated that 30-40% of patients dying of colorectal cancer will have macroscopic disease confined to the liver. 29 Second, preferential perfusion of tumor masses (versus normal liver tissue) can be achieved via hepatic artery infusions. 29 Finally, new treatments for colorectal carcinoma are needed. At the time of study initiation, the standard first-line therapy for advanced colon cancer was 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination with leucovorin (LV); irinotecan and oxaliplatin were used following 5-FU failure or in combination with 5-FU as first-line therapy. In numerous well-controlled trials, the response rate for 5-FU/LV is in the range of 10 to 25% with few complete responses and little impact on overall survival. 30 Therefore, experimental regional therapies utilizing hepatic artery infusion have been developed for colorectal liver metastases. 29 The treatment on this trial included two doses of ONYX-015 by hepatic artery infusion as a single agent followed by combination treatment with intravenous 5-FU and LV ( Figure 1 ). We have now demonstrated that intravascular administration of a replication-selective adenovirus is feasible and well-tolerated, both as a single agent and in combination with standard 5-FU and LV chemotherapy.

[10] [11] [12] [13] This patient received a dose of approximately 4 \u00d7 10 13 particles with a replicationdeficient adenovirus expressing the ornithine transcarbamylase gene. By report, in less than 24 h the patient experienced hyperammonemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation; this was followed over the next few days by multiorgan system failure and death. 10 On this trial we observed none of these complications. Several factors may account for these relative differences in safety. One plausible explanation is that the patient populations enrolled on to these two trials differed in their sensitivity to viral infection and the ensuing systemic inflammatory response. It is well-documented that patients with OTC deficiency have a heightened sensitivity to viral and bacterial infections compared with the general population, and that hyperammonemia, ARDS and death can result. 31 Unfortunately, the OTC patient reportedly had an elevated blood ammonia level before treatment on the trial. We have observed high-level induction of both interleukin-1 and -6, for example, following dl1520 administration, consistent with an adenovirus-induced systemic inflammatory response (T Reid, personal commu-nication). This sort of inflammation may not be tolerated in OTC patients. A second contributing factor to safety differences may have been that the viral doses tested on this study were approximately 10-fold lower. However, viral replication on this study probably led to longer term adenoviral exposure and shedding into the bloodstream than on the OTC trial with a replication-deficient adenovirus. In addition, five patients on a separate trial have now been treated intravenously with dl1520 at doses of 2 \u00d7 10 12 to 2 \u00d7 10 13 particles; these doses are up to 10-fold higher than on this trial and are close to those used before the fatal event in the OTC trial. 37 None of the complications that occurred in the OTC patient occurred in these patients. Finally, differences in the viruses themselves may have contributed, although the protein coats of the viral particles were identical on each study.

Based on allometric scaling, the lethal dose in a human would be predicted to be 6 \u00d7 10 13 particles.

In addition, the relative expression of coxsackieadenovirus receptor (CAR) differs between the human and the mouse in some organs. 32 Humans have higher relative receptor levels in the heart and lower relative levels in the liver, for example. The lack of clinically significant liver toxicity on this trial was encouraging. Transient low-grade transaminitis was demonstrated in some patients in the high-dose group, as was a single case of transient grade III hyperbilirubinemia. It is possible that clinically significant liver toxicity could occur at higher viral doses. On a separate trial, five patients were treated intravenously with dl1520 at doses of 2 \u00d7 10 12 to 2 \u00d7 10 13 particles (ie at doses up to 10-fold higher than on this trial). 37 Similar grade I-II transaminitis was demonstrated, but no clinically significant hepatotoxicity or other toxicity was encountered. With improvements in manufacturing, future trials may therefore explore higher doses of adenoviruses in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory carcinoma in order to determine the maximally tolerated dose by this route of administration; dose escalation would need to proceed cautiously at these high doses, but higher doses may result in enhanced antitumoral efficacy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 83, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 931, "end": 933, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1550, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study is the first to describe the replication of an adenovirus following intravascular administration in humans.

If future clinical trials demonstrate a correlation between efficacy and Gene Therapy neutralizing antibodies, the utility of antibody inhibition prior to and during intravascular viral therapy should be explored. 33 In addition, strategies to minimize antibody binding (eg modification of coat with polyethylene glycol) or serotype switching should be explored. 34 Although this phase I study was designed to evaluate single agent and combination therapy safety, humoral immune response and feasibility of tumor infection, antitumoral activity of ONYX-015 in combination with chemotherapy was assessed as a secondary endpoint. In combination with 5-FU and LV, dose-related antitumoral activity was demonstrated. Of note, a partial tumor response was demonstrated in a patient who was refractory to both 5-FU-based chemotherapy and to ONYX-015 administered separately; this is suggestive of a potential synergy between these agents. In addition, a patient failing lower dose virus plus chemotherapy subsequently underwent shrinkage (35% decrease) on high-dose virus plus chemotherapy. These findings are consistent with evidence of chemosensitization following intratumoral injection of ONYX-015 in head and neck cancer clinical trials. 24 In preclinical studies, we have shown that this interaction is dependent on viral replication and on the sequencing of the agents. Studies are underway to determine the role of inflammatory cytokines and specific viral gene products (eg E1A) in this interaction. 35, 36 Combination therapy with replication-selective adenoviruses and chemotherapy holds promise. Tumor cross-resistance is unlikely with agents working through such radically different mechanisms, and the combination has been well-tolerated to date due to a lack of overlapping toxicities.
