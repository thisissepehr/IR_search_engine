During each visit, subjects performed a total of nine fit tests using three samples of the same FFR model. Inward leakage and filter penetration were measured for each donned respirator to determine face seal leakage (FSL). A total of 195 subjects completed the second visit and 134 subjects completed all seven visits. Acceptable fit was defined as 90th percentile FSL \u08d8 5% and at least one fit factor \u08d9 100. An unacceptable fit was observed for 14, 10, 7, 12, 15, and 16% of subjects on Visits 2-7, respectively. The predicted risk of an unacceptable fit increased with increasing length of time between fit tests, from 10% at Year 1 to 20% at Year 2 and to 25% at Year 3. Twenty-four percent of subjects who lost \u08d9 20 lb had an unacceptable fit; these percentages ranged from 7-17% for subjects with lower weight losses or any degree of weight gain. Results support the current OSHA requirement for annual fit testing and suggest that respirator users who lose more than 20 lb should be re-tested for respirator fit.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Millions of industrial and healthcare workers are required to wear respirators to protect themselves from airborne workplace hazards. [1] Under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134) , users are initially fit tested to select an appropriately fitting respirator model; annual fit testing is performed thereafter to ensure that workers continue to be assigned a properly fitting respirator. [2] An annual fit testing requirement was adopted by OSHA in 1998 based on the current American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard and public comments citing workplace experience. [2] A 2001 survey of 269,389 businesses requiring employees to wear respirators found that while only 57% of these performed fit testing, of those, 70% reported allowing employees to fit test themselves. Thus, it appears that fit testing is only infrequently performed by employers.

During the 1998 OSHA hearings, the International Chemical Workers Union suggested that a change of 5% in body weight or 20 lb should be regarded as an obvious change in body weight requiring a repeated respirator fit test. [2] Only one study was found in a literature search on the relationship of weight change and respirator fit. The study found no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant subjects with respect to anthropometric measurements or respirator quantitative fit test results. [4] Participants at a 2004 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Workshop on Respiratory Protection for Airborne Infectious Agents requested data quantifying the benefits and scientific validity of annual fit testing, the impact of weight changes on fit, and whether repeated fit tests could be simplified. [5] A 2007 Institute of Medicine (IOM) study recommended that \"NIOSH \u2026perform research to determine which facial features have the greatest impact on respiratory protection of face masks in the workplace, using quantitative measures. \" [6] In response to these recommendations, NIOSH first conducted a pilot study to verify consistent data collection methods and ensure that test results were reproducible. [7] This pilot study found that geometric mean fit factors for ten subjects were not statistically different among three visits which occurred over a four-week period. Large variability was observed with different respirator samples for the same model, between subjects (inter) and within each subject (intra). Although variability was observed between subjects and respirator samples for each model, adequate fit was maintained for all ten subjects and three visits.

Inward leakage (IL) consists of particle leakage through two pathways: respirator filter (filter penetration) and the interface between the respirator and a wearer's face (faceseal leakage). A method for evaluating respirator fit by first determining IL by means of a test subject fit test was validated in a previous pilot study [7] and those methods were used for the current study. A PortaCount R Plus (Model: 8020A, TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN) condensation particle counter (without the N95-Companion accessory) was used to measure IL of ambient particles ranging from 0.02 to > 1 \u00b5m. [10] The PortaCount R Plus without N95-Companion counts a larger size range of particles (as compared to using the N95-Companion) and increases the calculated maximum fit factor value to > 10,000. Using the PortaCount Plus alone was also shown in a previous study to have a smaller combined error (alpha, beta, and assignment error) than the PortaCount R Plus with N95 Companion. [11] Based on results of a pilot study assessing changes in respirator fit over a four-week period, it was determined that this fit test method can adequately measure various variance components to allow accurate comparison of fit between visits. [7] While seated to accommodate subject comfort, subjects completed a fit test comprised of five individual exercises: normal breathing, deep breathing, breathing while moving their head from side to side, breathing while moving their head up and down, and a return to normal breathing. Each individual exercise had a total duration of 50 s comprised of (in order) a 4 s ambient sample line purge, 5 s ambient sample, 11 s mask sample line purge, and a 30 s mask sample; thus, each complete fit test comprised of 5 exercises lasted for approximately 4.2 min. Each subject visit required nine fit tests (3 samples \u00d7 3 donnings each), totaling approximately 40 min of fit testing. Subjects were prompted to conduct each exercise of a fit test by visual cues from a laptop computer running FitPlus for Windows (software developed by TSI, Inc. for fit test data collection). Three exercises-bending over, talking, and grimace-performed in the OSHA ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter (CNC) quantitative fit test protocol (CFR 1910.134 ) were omitted to economize on time to encourage on-going subject participation. Moving the head up and down has been found to be as challenging as bending over and talking. [12] The grimace exercise was excluded from our fit test protocol because this study aimed to evaluate changes in respirator fit due to weight gain/loss and was not concerned with how well a respirator is able to reseat on the user's face following the grimace.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 610, "end": 613, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 867, "end": 871, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1251, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1497, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2532, "text": "(CFR 1910.134", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2711, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inward leakage measurement (test subject fit test)"}, {"text": "The respirator model selection process only occurred on Visit 1.

We chose FF \u08d9 100 as the criterion for a passing FF value for this study. If the subject obtained a FF < 100 on three consecutive fit tests using the same respirator sample, he/she was asked to select another respirator model, watch a training video for that model, and then perform three fit tests using a sample of the new model.

Chi-Square analyses showed that there was an association between weight change category and fit acceptability status using the data from subjects gaining <10 lb compared to subjects loosing > = 20 lb (P-value < 0.01) and loosing > = 10 lb but <20 lb (P-value < 0.02).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 196, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Impact of weight change on fit acceptability"}, {"text": "This study was designed to address how frequently should respirator fit testing be conducted and what degree of weight change should trigger a new respirator fit test.

Thus for Visits \uf63a, \uf63b, and \uf63c for subjects with acceptable fit, the \" Weight\" category has one fewer subject than the \"Weight V\uf6dc\" category. a Numerator is the subjects with unacceptable fit on the indicated visit and the denominator is all subjects (both those classified as acceptable or unacceptable) experiencing the indicated weight change from Visit \uf6dc. The weight for Visit \uf6dc was always used to calculate weight changes since the fit was acceptable for all subjects for Visit \uf6dc. b The predictor variable is weight change category and the response variable is fit acceptability status. Weight gain < \uf6dc\uf639 lb is used as the positive status for \"weight change category\" and \"unacceptable fit\" is the positive status for \"fit acceptability status. \" An odds ratio > \uf6dc indicates a weight gain < \uf6dc\uf639 lb is more likely to result in unacceptable fit than the weight change category being compared to.

In this study different periods of times between fit tests were simulated. The key finding from this study is that as the simulated time between fit tests increased, so did the risk of unacceptable fit. If fit testing is conducted annually, the percent of subjects with unacceptable fit was 10.4%. If fit testing were performed only at the 2-year interval, the percent of subjects at risk for unacceptable fit is 19.7%. If fit testing is performed only at the 3-year interval, the percent of subjects at risk for unacceptable fit increased to 25.4%. The predicted risk of unacceptable fit provided an estimate of the OSHA annual fit test failure rate and an estimate of percent of workers who may benefit from annual fit testing. Weight analysis of the combined data from Visits 2-7 showed that of the subjects who lost \u08d9 20 lb, 24% had unacceptable fit. Therefore, the study results support the OSHA requirement for annual fit testing and additional fit testing guidance based on weight gain or loss. For countries in which fit testing is required every two years, that requirement may need to be changed to an annual fit test requirement. In the future, additional data analyses will be performed to understand the potential effects of other factors such as facial changes and respirator head strap length on fit change. Other factors which may influence respirator fit such as changes in face shape and dimensions (measured using both traditional and 3D measurement techniques) will be explored.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Departiment of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health: Respirator Usage in Private Sector Firms", "authors": [], "year": 2001, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration: Respiratory Protection, 29 CFR 1910.134: Final rule.
