The dynamic behaviors of the model are studied. Although model (\uf6dc) is simple, model (\uf6dc) is very important in viral epidemiology, which can show ample viral behaviors. Then, based on continuous model (\uf6dc), Shi and Dong in [\uf63a\uf63a] proposed a discrete-time analog for the special case f (x, y, v) = \u03b2x of model (\uf6dc) by using Micken's non-standard finite difference (NSFD) scheme.
