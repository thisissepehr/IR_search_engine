Negotiation of the Framework convention on tobacco control provides an apt example from global health diplomacy to tackle dietrelated chronic diseases.

Traditionally, nation states have dominated these processes, having negotiated internationally to address cross-border health risks since the mid-nineteenth century. 1 Today a diverse group of other non-state actors participate, impelled by the increasing impact of globalisation on health systems and population health. 2 Given the more immediate interdependence and stronger cross-border linkages associated with epidemics, the global health diplomacy agenda remains focused on infectious diseases, virus sample sharing, 3 pandemic flu 4,5 and SARS. 6 With such diseases, the ability of one country to protect the health of its population can directly depend on whether another country has the capacity to detect and respond to mobile, readily transmissible communicable pathogens, and vice versa. y By contrast [to such interdependence], interconnectedness does not involve relationships of mutual dependence among States and, thus, does not provide robust incentives for reciprocal undertakings to lower risks. In global health, interconnectedness is often a feature of non-communicable disease problems. For example, the export by a developed country of processed foods high in added sugars and salts may contribute to the prevalence of childhood or adult obesity in a developing country, but the health, security, and economic well-being of people in the developed country do not depend on whether the developing country controls and reduces the prevalence of obesity in its territory. 7 As emphasis on infectious diseases continues, 8 we concentrate here on an example of global health diplomacy to tackle chronic diseases: the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). In 2006, a technical group of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the WHO 'take the lead in the development of an international code on the commercial promotion of food and beverages to children' (p. 27) to address the rise of obesity in children globally. 9 In anticipation of these negotiations over the global marketing of food to children, we analyse lessons learned from the FCTC for use in diplomatic efforts to prevent diet-related chronic diseases.",

The treaty does not offer a blueprint for the elimination of tobacco use or for the banning of international trade in tobacco products; instead it creates an international legal framework for collective action on tobacco control.",

'Advertising and smuggling do not stop at national borders' (Brundtland, 11 p. 751). Trade liberalisation, including reduction in trade barriers for tobacco products, has facilitated market access for tobacco companies and contributed to increasing tobacco use in many developing countries. 12 Two decades of bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements adopted by many nations engendered significantly greater competition in domestic tobacco marketsaccompanied by reduced prices for tobacco products and dramatic increases in the advertising and promotion of these products. 13, 14 Growing numbers of investment protection treaties have facilitated international industry in establishing its presence and expanding marketing of foreign products to capture local markets. Signatories of these treaties are expected to decrease restrictions on the entry and operation of foreign investments and protect them against adverse government regulations. 15 Multinational tobacco companies undermine the regulatory authority of national governments through public relations and lobbying strategies. 16 This problem is especially acute in developing countries, given the asymmetry of resources between large global tobacco companies and the governments of small countries.",

Thus, global health diplomacy on issues of lesser interdependence is more arduous than in instances where countries directly feel the impact of the actions (or inaction) of their neighbours.

Some have suggested that treaty negotiations on national regulations to promote healthy diets would not be so different from the experience with tobacco control. 21 An important consideration is the extent of interdependence among nations as a key incentive for cross-border collaboration. What other incentives will lead national governments and other actors to pursue collective actions globally (or regionally)? Strengthening the position of national regulators and public health agencies to take on wellorganised lobbying became an incentive for cross-border collaboration. Liberal policies on tobacco marketing in one country or lax enforcement of anti-smuggling law could impact tobacco use in another country. Adoption of trade liberalisation and international trade agreements that have had a direct impact on tobacco availability and use, especially in developing countries, also involved interdependence. 22 The FCTC does not fully address this issue; although tension between trade liberalisation and tobacco control was evident in negotiations, the final text is silent on precedence of international trade law over the FCTC. 18 It will be useful to study this further given the importance of international trade agreements for healthy diets. 23 Although FCTC negotiations led to a multilateral treaty under the aegis of the WHO, those pursuing obesity reduction should not focus too narrowly on this specific forum. A key impact of FCTC negotiations lies outside the formal treaty: global networking among public health advocates inside and outside government and the diffusion of policies. Following intense international interactions on experiences with tobacco control policies, countries accelerated the adoption of new measures. As Collin and Lee observe, national policy development and FCTC negotiations clearly interacted. Once Canada adopted large graphic health warnings, Thailand, Brazil and the European Union replicated them. 18 Important impacts of the recent global health diplomacy on tobacco control include global mobilisation of civil society in support of the FCTC and the rise of a large coalition, the Framework Convention Alliance.",

First, which actors need to be involved in the process? Political leadership, strong mobilisation and advocacy from well-organised groups globally are crucial in triggering and sustaining a global policy response such as an international treaty. Whether a critical mass of political capital is available at this point in the area of diet and nutrition remains to be seen. 24 Second, global health diplomacy on obesity will require a much stronger engagement with developing countries. Many of these countries perceive the discussions as more relevant to industrial countries despite the rapid growth of obesity in emerging and middle-income developing countries.",

Some may provide leadership. A diverse group of businesses produce, process, distribute, market and sell food and drinks. For tobacco control, the ultimate public health goal is elimination of the industry. Obviously the food industry plays an essential role, and the policy 'end game' for chronic diseases is transformation to a health-oriented food system, not the extinction of the industry or many of its activities. As interests of some food industry actors (industries dealing in fresh fruits and vegetables) merge with those promoting global public policies for healthier diets, meaningful collaboration against obesity is likely to be easier to achieve.",

We should be doing almost the opposite. Instead of shaming and blaming we need to find ways of working with the industry. 25 Others suggest that the FCTC precedent, a binding international treaty, would provide a useful tool for regulating the food industry, especially for snack foods, sodas, fast foods and prepared foods that to blame for the great increase in obesity. 17 They remain sceptical about the possibility of productive collaboration with commercial actors given the ways in which interests diverge. 21 Another argument made in favour of the FCTC approach is the power of multilateral negotiations to mobilise groups to act nationally and locally and to increase the exchange of policy innovation. Emily Lee 26 suggested that motivation to adopt the framework-convention model involving an incremental approach to standard-setting, instead of one single detailed treaty for tobacco control, derived from anticipation of strong opposition from the tobacco industry. She also argued that the rationale applies in this case to obesity, and once again this incremental approach will be more likely to succeed. 26 Based on these lessons, we conclude that global health diplomacy for obesity prevention requires a much higher level of mobilisation of political leaders, civil society organisations, governments and non-state actors in developing countries, and engagement with the many private actors in the agri-food industries before healthy diet proponents are ready to negotiate a treaty similar to the FCTC. In order to progress as rapidly as possible, future analytical work should identify what issues could be more easily tackled in a collaborative manner, and for which issues regulation and a treaty would be the most effective instruments. Given that marketing of food to children is already on the global diplomatic agenda, researchers may want to focus on this.",

This process itself can foster the adoption of pro-health policies at the local, national, regional and global level.
