It should also encourage a transition from the nearly exclusive focus on 'cures' to a much needed focus on 'prevention'. Physicians have long known of the admonition: ''An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure''. As they become more aware that reducing risks to human health requires fostering ecosystem health, they can become far more effective in encouraging the transition to global environmental, social, and health sustainability by promoting, through public education programs, the kind of care required to maintain ecological balance in the interests of public health and human well-being (McMichael et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 293, "text": "(Rapport and Lee 2003", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 294, "end": 312, "text": ", Arya et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 313, "end": 341, "text": ", Chivian and Bernstein 2008", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1264, "text": "(McMichael et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ecosystem approaches to global public health"}, {"text": "As we have shown, the concept and applications of ecosystem health have central relevance to assessing and evaluating ecological transformation and to connecting ecological imbalance to human activities and to the consequences for human health and well-being.

As we will show by way of example in the next section, it is the breakdown of the complex interdependencies built, over centuries or even millennia, between people and ecosystems that accounts for many if not most of the cases of ecosystem and societal collapse we have witnessed in the past and are increasingly witnessing today, along with increased disease vulnerability for humans and other species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A broader synthesis: eco-cultural health"}, {"text": "The Inner Mongolian grasslands: an example of loss of eco-cultural health and its implications for human health For a telling example, we can look to the recent history of the grasslands of Inner Mongolia (Rapport and Maffi 2010) . Inner Mongolia contains five major grasslands, each with its unique ecology and history of human activity. The Horquin Sandy Lands in northeastern Inner Mongolia have been periodically occupied by Mongolian nomadic herders for many thousands of years. Over this period, the herders developed their nomadic lifestyle, adapting to the ecology of the grasslands by moving their herds (sheep, goats, horses, and camels) as seasonal grasses became available. In this way they maintained low grazing pressure, which sustained the health of the grasslands and their culture. However, at least three times over the past 8,000 years (including at present), the symbiotic relationship between nature and culture was interrupted by large-scale influx of farmers and sedentary pastoralists, which transformed the grassland into vast agricultural lands. Each time, once the limited soil nutrients were depleted, the grasslands became desertified, and were abandoned for millennia.

Since the 1950s, more than 2.5 million hectares of grasslands in the Horqin Sandy Lands have been converted to farmland, and farming activities have expanded to the northern frontier areas. In recent times, farms have been abandoned owing to nutrient decline, and seasonal wind storms blow off remaining soils and expose underlying sand, leading to dune mobilization. By the late 1950s, 28% of the land in the Horqin steppe had become desert; by the mid-1970s, this area had increased to 53%, and by the end of the 1980s it stood at 78% (Liu et al. 2003) . As of 2006, for Inner Mongolia as a whole, an estimated 90% of grasslands have been degraded to some degree-more than twice the amount of a decade earlier-while productivity of disturbed grasslands stood at only 50% of the productivity of the undisturbed steppe (Jiang et al. 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 922, "end": 939, "text": "(Liu et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1223, "text": "(Jiang et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A broader synthesis: eco-cultural health"}, {"text": "Today, blowing and drifting sands threaten remaining farmlands, and roads are often buried by the wind-borne sand particles.

As croplands are abandoned and dunes mobilized, people are being forced to exploit marginal lands for growing crops (such as along the margins of river beds), and towns have been overtaken and abandoned. As the sands advance, grazing lands are progressively reduced, adding to the adverse political conditions that threaten the continuation of ecosystem-friendly nomadic ways of life. The health of millions of people in Inner Mongolia is under severe threat, owing to increasingly harsh environments, declining availability of food and water, severe respiratory problems and eye infections from dust and sand storms, exposure to contaminants (including toxic substances and heavy metals) and pathogens (such as TB, flu virus, and hantavirus) carried by dust, and other ills (Griffin et al. 2001; Ellis 2007; Pimentel et al. 2007 ). The grasslands of many regions of Inner Mongolia are likely to be well beyond the point of self-repair, leaving little hope for the improvement in the health and well-being of people.

At national and regional levels, good governance must rely upon appropriate tools for assessing and forecasting trends in eco-cultural health, in order to identify the main threats to the health of both ecosystems and people and their implications for sustaining life. There are some promising examples. In recent years, recognition of the importance of this broader perspective gave rise to an agreement among the leaders of the Mesoamerican countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras) to take collective action to mitigate the deterioration in the off-shore Mesoamerican coral reef, based not only on ecological considerations, but as well on cultural, socio-economic, governance, and public health dimensions (World Bank 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 451, "end": 464, "text": "(Ostrom 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 465, "end": 484, "text": "Ostrom et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 485, "end": 503, "text": "Dietz et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1551, "text": "(World Bank 2006)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications for policy and action"}, {"text": "Such examples of good governance must be multiplied and strengthened if there is to be hope to stem further degradation of the earth's eco-cultural systems.
