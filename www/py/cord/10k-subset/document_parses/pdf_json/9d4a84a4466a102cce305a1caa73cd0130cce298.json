Initially presenting with features of a virus-induced polymyositis, both symptomatic and biochemical improvements were initially achieved with glucocorticoid-based immunosuppression. Subsequently he represented with evidence of severe generalised rhabdomyolysis (creatinine kinase peaking at 210,000 U/L). Rendered anuric from the myogloburic assault, he required intensive care support from the development of multi-organ failure. Subsequent investigations failed to demonstrate an infective, inXammatory, metabolic or inherited aetiology. Muscle biopsy demonstrated severe generalised necrotising myopathy in the notable absence of inXammation. ConWdential discussion with the patient and relatives conWrmed a suspicion of anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse. There is limited literature as to the toxic eVect of AAS compounds on muscle tissue, and these tend to focus on localised disease. Indeed, AAS have consistently been shown in animal models to produce a generalised myotrophic state. Apart from the social uses of such compounds, the scope for their supervised use in various medical conditions has been established since the 1960s. A 23-year-old gentleman, with an unremarkable medical history presented with a 1-week history of coryzal symptoms and generalised myalgia. A reduced quantity of dark urine production was also noted, and there were no features of autoimmune disease. Born in Sri Lanka, there was no recent history of foreign travel and no signiWcant family history. He denied the use of recreational drugs, and only occasionally used alcohol modestly.

Drug induced myopathies represent a distinct subgroup of myopathies that diVer in terms of their pathological mechanisms [2] . This group of disorders is of great interest to the clinician as the disease progress may be limited or reversed by treatment of the underlying cause [3] . Toxic myopathies also serve as excellent experimental models in relation to muscle research. Toxic myopathies may be divided into six groups [2] . These are necrotizing myopathy, vacuolar myopathy, inXammatory myopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, steroid myopathy and hypokalaemic myopathy [2] . Body-builders, athletes and other sporting professions have used anabolic steroids for several decades as an aid to build muscle mass and strength [4] . Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) achieve a supra-physiological testosterone state, prolonging its action in vivo [5] . AAS have a wide physiological range of action. AAS use is associated with numerous side eVects which are in general a dose-related phenomenon; therefore, it is the groups which use these in large doses that are most susceptible. These include masculination in women and children, hepatic and lipid impairment and behavioural changes such as aggression [5] .

            "text": "The muscle biopsy in this patient demonstrated evidence of extensive necrotising myositis. This is usually associated with drug therapy such as Wbrates and statins [2] ; however, as described anabolic steroids may cause both local and generalised muscle disease. Therefore in conclusion we propose by the exclusion of other potential aetiological causes, this gentleman's extensive necrotising myositis, and resulting severe rhabdomyolysis is a manifestation of anabolic androgenic steroid toxicity. There is limited literature as to the potential toxic eVect of androgenic anabolic steroids on diVerentiated skeletal muscle, apart from a few case reports which describe localised myopathy. Animal models have indeed demonstrated the ability of such agents to induce a generalised myopathic state. The potentially beneWcial eVects of androgenic anabolic steroids in a medical setting have been well recognised since the 1960s. There appears to be an increasing amount of published literature in regards to emerging areas to which these compounds may be suitable. This case also serves to highlight the toxic eVects of such agents, and why these should be prescribed and monitored by a medical practitioner.",
