While multiple methods having been created to characterize this variation through the identification of groups of species that tend to co-occur, most of these methods unfortunately are not able to represent gradual variation in species composition. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is a mixed-membership method that can represent gradual changes in community structure by delineating overlapping groups of species, but its use has been limited because it requires abundance data and requires users to a priori set the number of groups. We substantially extend LDA to accommodate widely available presence/absence data and to simultaneously determine the optimal number of groups. Using simulated data, we show that this model is able to accurately determine the true number of groups, estimate the underlying parameters, and fit with the data. We illustrate this method with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Overall, our model identified 18 main bird groups, revealing striking spatial patterns for each group, many of which were closely associated with temperature and precipitation gradients. Furthermore, by comparing the estimated proportion of each group for two time periods (1997-2002 and 2010-2015), our results indicate that nine (of 18) breeding bird groups exhibited an expansion northward and contraction southward of their ranges, revealing subtle but important community-level biodiversity changes at a continental scale that are consistent with those expected under climate change. Our proposed method is likely to find multiple uses in ecology, being a valuable addition to the toolkit of ecologists.",

For instance, biome transition zones, ecotones, and habitat edges are locations that are often comprised of a mix of species groups, providing sources for potentially novel species interactions (Gosz, 1993; Ries, Fletcher, Battin, & Sisk, 2004) . Similarly, climate change is predicted to cause geographic shifts in species and communities, leading to the hypothesis of novel assemblages arising across space as climate and habitat changes (Urban et al., 2016; Williams & Jackson, 2007) . In addition, most partitioning methods that delineate biogeographical regions or modules based on hard boundaries can lead to high uncertainty in boundary delineation-an issue that can be rectified by allowing groups to overlap. It is important to note that LDA allows for overlapping groups, but it does not require it to be present (i.e., if data do not support overlap, no overlap is estimated).",

In the absence of abundance data, researchers often have to rely on presence/absence data to understand species distributions and biodiversity patterns (Jones, 2011; Joseph, Field, Wilcox, & Possingham, 2006) . Another limitation of the LDA model is that the number of groups has to be prespecified, requiring researchers to run LDA multiple times to then use some criterion (e.g., AIC) to choose the optimal number of groups (e.g., Valle et al., 2014) , an approach that often can be computationally costly.",

We adopt the term species group (instead of \"bioregion\" or other related terms) because these major co-occurrence patterns do not have to have a strong spatial pattern (although they often do), these groups can overlap in space, and proportion of groups can change through time. More specifically, our method characterizes each sampling unit l in terms of the proportion of the different groups (parameter vector \u03b8 l ) and characterizes each group k in terms of the probability of the different species (parameter vector \u03d5 k ). For example, \u03b8 l \u00bc 0:1; 0:8; 0:1; 0 \u00bd indicates that the second group dominates unit l and that the fourth group is absent. This example also illustrates that a given sampling unit can be comprised of multiple groups, which explains why these types of models are called mixed-membership models. In the same way, \u03d5 k \u00bc 0; 0:8; 0:8 \u00bd indicates that species 2 and 3 (but not species 1) are important species of group k.

Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms applied to these types of models sometimes mix poorly and can lead to nonsensical results if posterior distributions of parameters are summarized by their averages (Stephens, 2000) . The label switching problem refers to the fact that the labels of the different groups can change (e.g., groups 1 and 2 can become groups 2 and 1, respectively) without changing the likelihood (i.e., the group labels are unidentifiable).

Mixture model approaches such as RCP are sometimes perceived to be able to represent these gradual changes in the proportion of groups. However, F I G U R E 1 The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) estimates well the true number of groups (boxplots) and the \u03b8 lk parameter values (scatterplots). Results from all 10 datasets in each simulation setting are displayed simultaneously, based on LDA with \u03b3 set to 0.1. Top and bottom panels display results for three and 10 groups, respectively. Boxplots in panels (a) and (f) show the estimated number of groups (i.e., the number of groups deemed not to be superfluous), revealing that LDA can estimate well the true number of groups (K*) except for datasets with few locations (L), few species (S) but many groups (i.e., 100L 50S 10K*). Scatterplots (panels b-e and g-j) reveal that the \u03b8 lk parameters can also be well estimated but there is considerable noise for datasets with few species but many groups (panels g and h). A 1:1 line and a linear regression line were added for reference (blue and red lines, respectively) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] our results reveal that, when applied to our simulated data, RCP tended to give transition regions that were too narrow (RCP panels in Figure 2 ). These model comparison results are particularly striking given that LDA was fitted assuming 20 potential groups, whereas results for the other methods were based on the assumption that the true number of groups was known. Notice that these figures illustrate how LDA can capture gradual changes in species composition associated with global change phenomena depending on what is being represented in the x-axis. For instance, the x-axis can represent a spatial gradient of anthropogenic forest disturbance (e.g., timber logging intensity or distance to forest edge) or can represent time (i.e., the same location sampled repeatedly through time, perhaps revealing the impact of climate change on species composition).",

It has long been known that many bird species have strong relationships with abiotic gradients (Bowen, 1933) , but how these gradients can explain entire groups of species has remained elusive.

In other words, \u03b8 lk may change with time but \u03d5 ks does not. This is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where it is possible that the species composition of the groups themselves might be changing (Lurgi, Lopez, & Montoya, 2012; Stralberg et al., 2009; Urban et al., 2016) . Another important limitation in this study is that the proposed model does not take into account imperfect detection, a pervasive issue for wildlife sampling (MacKenzie et al., 2002; Royle, 2004) . This shortcoming can be partially attributed to inherent limitations in the BBS dataset, given that the estimation of detection probabilities requires very specific data types (e.g., repeated visits in occupancy models). It is also critical to highlight the importance of repeated observations per location given the relatively low information content in binary presence/absence data. Determining all the parameters in the proposed model, including the optimal number of groups, can be challenging in the absence of these repeated observations. Finally, although important broad-scale patterns can be identified and novel insights gained from post hoc analysis of LDA model parameters, as illustrated with our case study, these results rely on a two-stage analysis that does not take into uncertainty in the estimated parameters. Our ongoing work is focused on extending LDA to accommodate covariates through regression models built-in to LDA so that uncertainty can be coherently propagated when performing more formal statistical tests and when making spatial and temporal predictions.",

Nevertheless, this method could also be applied in a landscape-scale context, identifying spatial variation in community structure within general habitat types and across patches, or to analyze long-term temporal changes in time-series data of species composition (e.g., Christensen, Harris, & Ernest, 2018) . Given the ubiquity of presence/absence data in community ecology, we believe that the extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model developed here will see a much wider use, becoming an important addition to the toolkit of community ecologists.",

These figures highlight that transition areas, either relative to precipitation or temperature, are often comprised of mixtures of groups. This pattern might arise because these areas are comprised of heterogeneous habitats and/or these areas are relatively homogeneous but with intermediate characteristics in comparison with sites with higher/lower precipitation or temperature. Regardless of the reason for this pattern, these areas are clearly suitable for multiple groups, an important characteristic that unfortunately cannot be captured with hard clustering methods.3.3.1 | Temporal patterns based on a comparison of\u03b8 1997\u00c02002 \u00f0 \u00de lk and \u03b8 2010\u00c02015 \u00f0 \u00de lkAlthough our results indicate that breeding bird groups have fairly consistent spatial distributions in both time periods(1997-  2002 and 2010-2015;  data not shown), we find statistically significant positive associations between latitude and changes in proportion between these two periods ((out of 18) using data from routes sampled during both of these time periods. This positive association reveals that increases in proportion tend to occur at higher latitudes whereas decreases are more likely at lower latitudes(Figure 6), supporting the hypothesis that breeding bird groups are increasingly expanding their range toward northern areas while contracting their range at southern boundaries. The remaining nine groups did not have a statistically significant association between latitude and changes in proportion. Although this analysis ignores uncertainty in parameter estimates for \u03b8 in highlighting relatively subtle but important trends.In particular, these results agree with the patterns we a priori expected based on the warming environment, being robust to the threshold used to define a group's range (i.e., changing this threshold from 0.05 to 0.1 or 0.5 yielded several groups with statistically significant positive association with latitude, with the remaining groups having no statistically significant association).",

Additional details regarding how these different methods were fit and how model fit was assessed are available in Supporting Information Appendix S3.The Breeding Bird Survey is a long-term program that monitors thestatus and trend of bird populations in North America. In brief, data are collected annually in June by trained participants along randomly established roadside routes approximately 39 km long with stops 0.8 km apart. At each stop, a 3-min point count is conducted (Pardieck et al., 2017).Because we were interested in spatial mapping of groups over time, we subset the data to the period 1997-2015, which had the greatest consistency in route surveys. Furthermore, we eliminated data from very rare and very common species, defined here as species that are present in <1% or more than 50% of the transect-byyear combinations, respectively. This resulted in the exclusion of 48% (rare species) and 3% (common species such as American Robin, Mourning Dove, and American Crow) of the species. The rationale for this decision is that species that are too rare tend to convey little information on groups while species that are common everywhere are likely to be important species in almost all groups, contributing little to discriminate between these groups. Similar decisions are made when other clustering methods are used in ecology (e.g.,Azeria et al., 2009) and when the standard LDA is used for text-mining, where both low-and high-frequency words are often removed prior to running the model(Boyd-Graber, Mimno, & Newman, 2014).Finally, the BBS actually records count data (rather than presence/ absence) per stop in each route. However, because these counts may include the same individual observed multiple times and bird detection may vary by species and environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic noise), we decided to convert these data into presence/absence of each species per route. In total, the final dataset used for analysis contained information on 354 species and 4,397 routes, spread throughout Canada and the United States.",
