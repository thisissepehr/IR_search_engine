Moreover, the effect of three types, namely, contact, local, and global, of infection awareness and immunization awareness is also taken into consideration. The model generalizes those considered in Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [Phys. Rev. E 63, 066117 (2001)], Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [Phys. Rev. E 65, 036104 (2002)], Moreno et al. [Eur. Phys. J. B 26, 521-529 (2002)], Wu et al. [Chaos 22, 013101 (2012)], and Wu et al. [Chaos 24, 023108 (2014)]. Our main results contain the following. First, the epidemic threshold is explicitly obtained. In particular, we show that, for any initial conditions, the epidemic eventually dies out regardless of what other factors are whenever some type of immunization awareness is considered, and vaccination has a perfect success. Moreover, the threshold is independent of the global type of awareness. Second, we compare the effect of contact and local types of awareness on the epidemic thresholds between heterogeneous networks and homogeneous networks. Specifically, we find that the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network can be lower than that of the heterogeneous network in an intermediate regime for intensity of contact infection awareness while it is higher otherwise. In summary, our results highlight the important and crucial roles of both vaccine success and contact infection awareness on epidemic dynamics. Published by AIP Publishing.

We obtain two unexpected results. First, if people are aware of the importance of immunization and vaccination is always successful, then, for any initial conditions, the epidemic can be under control even if the spreading rate of the disease is extremely high. Second, it is shown that, although the epidemic threshold is smaller for the heterogeneous network in low and high intensity of contact infection awareness, there is an intermediate regime where the epidemic threshold is in contrast higher for the homogeneous network.",

It is reported 6 that, although vaccine success has usually been about 85%, success as low as 44% has also been observed. To the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical work to discuss the role of vaccine failure was given in Ref. 7.

            "text": "In the past few decades, several effective immunization strategies have been proposed to minimize the risk of the outbreak of epidemic diseases on complex networks. 2, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Recently, the study of aspects of human responses towards the spread of epidemic diseases has drawn much attention 4, 7, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] due to the fact that the change of individual behaviors has an effect on the epidemic dynamics. In the literature, 4, 18, 29, 30 according to the source of information, awareness is classified into three types, which are termed contact awareness, local awareness, and global awareness. For the first type, it is assumed 4,29 that individuals with larger contact number in a network are more willing to change their behavior in order to reduce the risk of being infected. The second one is based on personal local information or local infection density. 4, 18 The third one is based on the global infection density in a whole community. 4, 31 The information relating to that may come from national media, e.g., public health authorities. In this work, we shall further differentiate each of the three types of awareness into two cases: infection awareness and immunization awareness. People with infection awareness are more likely to take extra steps to avoid infection, while people with immunization awareness increase likelihood for getting vaccinated. It should also be noted that in heterogeneous networks such as scale-free (SF) ones, the effect of these three types of awareness cannot be separated completely. Such combined effect is also addressed in Ref. 4 .",

In particular, if immunization awareness is considered and vaccination has a perfect success, then the epidemic dies out eventually regardless of what other factors are or what initial conditions are. Furthermore, such threshold depends on the contact type of awareness and local infection awareness, and is independent of all the other types of awareness. Such result indeed suggests that the effect of these three types of awareness against the outbreak of an epidemic disease in decreasing order in terms of their importance is contact awareness, local awareness, and global awareness. Second, we compare the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network, where individuals have roughly the same degree (contact number), and the heterogeneous network, where individuals' degree distribution has a heavy tail. We show that the epidemic threshold for the homogeneous network can be lower than that of the heterogeneous network in an interval J of intensity of contact infection awareness, while it is higher otherwise.

Numerical simulations to support our theoretical results and their other implications are given in Section V. In Section VI, we discuss some of the works related to ours. The summary of our obtained results and the future work is provided in Section VII. In Appendix A, we give the detailed derivation of the continuous-time epidemic spreading model from the discrete-time one. All the proofs of our results are recorded in Appendix B.",

It is assumed that each individual, at each time t, is in one of the following three discrete states: infectious (I), vaccinated (V), and susceptible (S), and each could transfer its state at time t to a new one at time t \u00fe 1 through one of the following four different ways: (i) S ! I, (ii) S ! V, (iii) V ! S, and (iv) I ! S. Letting p i \u00f0t\u00de (respectively, q i \u00f0t\u00de), i \u00bc 1; \u2026; N, be the probability that a node i is infectious (respectively, vaccinated) at time t, our model under consideration reads as follows: p i \u00f0t \u00fe 1\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 c\u00dep i \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe \u00bd1 \u00c0 p i \u00f0t\u00de \u00c0 q i \u00f0t\u00deProb i \u00f0S !

Similar usage of the term is to be followed. We assume that a node with a higher degree is aware of the higher risk to be infected and, consequently, it increases its protection and hence reduces the probability of getting infected. Thus, it is assumed that function w\u00f0k\u00de is decreasing in the degree k. In Ref. 4 , w\u00f0k\u00de is chosen to be k \u00c0b for some nonnegative constant b. The larger the quantity b is, the smaller the w\u00f0k\u00de and the term defined in (1b) is, and hence the less likely a susceptible individual would get infected. The constant b is to be termed as the intensity of contact infection awareness. Note that, if w\u00f0k\u00de is independent of k (i.e., b \u00bc 0), then there is no contact infection awareness in the epidemic spreading. (ii)",

In the case that P\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc k \u00c0r =c; k \u00bc m; \u2026; M, where c \u00bc P M k\u00bcm k \u00c0r , and functions w andw are defined as in (6) , we compute, via (5) , thatSince the numerator of the above equation is finite for any r 2 \u00f02; 3 and the denominator goes to 1 as M tends to 1 if and only if b \u00fe r 3, the proof of theorem is complete. \u0657 In Theorems 3-5, we aim to compare the size ofk c\u00f0SF\u00de andk c\u00f0Homo\u00de . To this end, we need to apply some wellknown results, which are stated in the following two lemmas for ease of the references.Lemma B.1 (Jesen's inequality). Let P(k) be a discrete probability distribution and f be a continuous function defined on \u00bdm; M. If f is convex (respectively, concave) in \u00bdm; M, then f \u00f0 P k x k P\u00f0k\u00de\u00de (respectively, !) P k f \u00f0x k \u00deP\u00f0k\u00de. Moreover, both of the above equalities hold if and only if x k are all equal or f is linear.Lemma B.2 (Theorem F in p. 19 of Ref. 46 ). Let f be a positive function defined in an interval I. Then f is said to be a log-convex function in I if ln\u00f0f \u00de is convex in I. The class of log-convex functions in I is closed under addition, multiplication, and taking the limits, provided that the limits exist and are positive.Proposition B.2. Defin\u00eaThen (i)k c\u00f0SF\u00de k c\u00f0Homo\u00de , whenever\u0175 c \u00f0x\u00de is convex in \u00bdm; M, (ii)k c\u00f0SF\u00de !k c\u00f0Homo\u00de , whenever\u0175 c \u00f0x\u00de is concave in \u00bdm; M.Moreover, both of the above equalities hold if and only if \u00f0b;b; a\u00de equals to \u00f01; 0; a\u00de; \u00f01; 1; 1 d\u00fe1 \u00de, (2, 0, 0) or \u00f02; 1; 1 d\u00fe1 \u00de where a 2 \u00bd0; 1.Proof. From (B4) and (7), it is clear thatwhere P\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc k \u00c0r =c, and k c Homorespectively. Then by applying Lemma B.1 to function\u0175 c and letting x k \u00bc k, the proof of the theorem is complete. \u0657 Lemma B.3. Supposeb \u00bc 0. Then the following assertions hold.thenk c\u00f0SF\u00de >k c\u00f0Homo\u00de ; (iv) If b \u00bc 2, thenk c\u00f0SF\u00de !k c\u00f0Homo\u00de and the equality holds only when a \u00bc 0.If b > 2 and a < b\u00c02 b , thenk c\u00f0SF\u00de <k c\u00f0Homo\u00de . Proof. In the case ofb \u00bc 0, we compute directly by (B5) that\u0175 00 c \u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 b\u00de\u00bd\u00f02 \u00c0 b\u00dex \u00fe abx \u00c01\u00c0b :It follows that\u0175 00 c \u00f0x\u00de > 0 (respectively, < 0) in \u00bd1; 1\u00de if b < 1 (respectively, 1 < b < 2). Hence, statements (i) and (iii) in the lemma hold true by Proposition B.2.For b > 2, since lim x!1\u0175 00 c \u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00fe1 and sgn\u00f0\u0175 00 c \u00f0x\u00de\u00de \u00bc sgn\u00f0\u00f0b \u00c0 2\u00dex \u00c0 ab\u00de is increasing in x,\u0175 00 c \u00f0x\u00de has the same sign in \u00bd1; 1\u00de if and only if sgn\u00f0\u0175 00 c \u00f01\u00de\u00de \u00bc sgn\u00f0\u00f0b \u00c0 2\u00de \u00c0ab\u00de \u00bc 1, or equivalently, a < b\u00c02 b . Hence, statement (v) holds true. The remaining statements (ii), (iv), and (v) in the lemma can be shown similarly and thus are omitted.\u0657 We are now in the position to prove Theorems 3-5. Proof of Theorem 3. In the following, we only give the proof for the case that M \u00bc 1. When M < 1, the proof can be obtained similarly.For any a 2 \u00bd0; 1;b ! 0 and r 2 \u00f02; 3, define function g(b) in \u00f03 \u00c0 r; 1\u00de by g\u00f0b\u00de :\u00bc ln\u00f0\u00bdk c\u00f0SF\u00de \u00f0b; a\u00de \u00c01 \u00de \u00c0 ln\u00f0\u00bdk c\u00f0Homo\u00de \u00f0b; a\u00de \u00c01 \u00de: (B6) Then by Theorem 2 and Eq. (7), g is well defined for all r 2 \u00f02; 3. Moreover, when b \u00bc 3 \u00c0 r, sincek c\u00f0SF\u00de \u00bc 0 and k c\u00f0Homo\u00de > 0, we have that lim b!\u00f03\u00c0r\u00de \u00fe g\u00f0b\u00de \u00bc \u00fe1. We now show that g is convex. Since, by (B4)we compute hat @ 2 @b 2 ln d\u00f0k 2 \u00c0ak\u00deck \u00c0r d\u00fe\u00f01\u00c0k \u00c0b \u00de k \u00c0b we compute that @ 2 @b 2 lnk c\u00f0Homo\u00de \u00f0b; a\u00de h i \u00c01 ! 0. From the above, we conclude that g 00 \u00f0b\u00de ! 0 on \u00f03 \u00c0 r; 1\u00de. That is, g is convex on \u00f03 \u00c0 r; 1\u00de. We next show the existence of b 2 \u00f0a; m; M\u00de for a 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de and m 2 N in the case thatb \u00bc 0. From Lemma B.3, it is easy to see that, for any a 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de, g(b) > 0 when b 2 \u00bd3 \u00c0 r; 1\u00de [ 2 1\u00c0a ; 1\u00de; g\u00f01\u00de \u00bc 0 \u00c0 , while g(b) < 0 when b 2 \u00f01; 2\u00de. Then the convex property of g implies that it has exactly two zeros at b \u00bc 1 and some b 2 \u00f0\u00bc b 2 \u00f0a; m; M\u00de\u00de 2 \u00bd2; 2 1\u00c0a \u00de. In fact, g(b) > 0 when b 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de [ \u00f0b 2 ; 1\u00de and g(b) < 0 when b 2 \u00f01; b 2 \u00de. Then by the definition of g, the inequalities stated in the theorem hold true. Now, we show that b 2 \u00f0a; m; M\u00de is strictly increasing in a 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de. Suppose not, then there exist a 1 6 \u00bc a 2 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de such that b 2 \u00f0a 1 ; m; M\u00de \u00bc b 2 \u00f0a 2 ; m; M\u00de \u00f0\u00bc: b \u00c3 \u00de. By the definition of function b 2 \u00f0a; m; M\u00de,k c\u00f0SF\u00de \u00f0b \u00c3 ; a 1 \u00de \u00bck c\u00f0Homo\u00de \u00f0b \u00c3 ; a 2 \u00de and b \u00c3 ! 2 as claimed above. For each fixed b > 3 \u00c0 r, Since, by Lemma B.1, hk 2\u00c0b i ! hki 2\u00c0b for b ! 2 and the equality holds if and only if b \u00bc 2, we have that hk 1\u00c0b \u00c3 i \u00c0 hki 1\u00c0b \u00c3 > 0. It follows that h b \u00c3 has exactly one zero, which is a contradiction to the fact that h b \u00c3 \u00f0a 1 \u00de \u00bc h b \u00c3 \u00f0a 2 \u00de \u00bc 0. Moreover, it is clear to see that, since h b \u00c3 \u00f0a\u00de \u00bc 0, we have that:Hence, the proof is complete. \u0657 Proof of Theorem 4. Note that the facts that the function g(b), defined in (B6), is convex on \u00f03 \u00c0 r; 1\u00de and lim b!\u00f03\u00c0r\u00de \u00fe g\u00f0b\u00de \u00bc \u00fe1 are proved for allb ! 0 and a 2 \u00bd0; 1. Moreover, by Theorem 2 and Eq. (7), g(b) > 0 for b on \u00f03 \u00c0 r; 1\u00de or there exists some nonempty open interval J such that g(b) < 0 if and only if b 2 J. These two scenarios correspond tok c\u00f0SF\u00de <k c\u00f0Homo\u00de andk c\u00f0SF\u00de >k c\u00f0Homo\u00de , respectively.On the other hand, consider the function h b \u00f0a\u00de defined in (B7). Thenk c\u00f0SF\u00de \u00f0b; a\u00de \u00bck c\u00f0Homo\u00de \u00f0b; a\u00de if and only ifHence, the proof is complete. \u0657 Proof of Theorem 5. Forb > 0, we compute directly that\u0175\u00fe a\u00f02b 2 \u00c0 2bb \u00c0b 2 \u00c0 2b \u00feb\u00de\u00f0d \u00fe 1\u00dexb \u00fe \u00f0b \u00c0b \u00c0 1\u00de\u00f0b \u00c0b \u00c0 2\u00dex \u00c0 a\u00f0b \u00c0b\u00de\u00f0b \u00c0b \u00c0 1\u00de:Then sgn\u00f0\u0175 00 c \u00f0x\u00de\u00de \u00bc sgn\u00f0 w\u00f0x\u00de\u00de.Clearly, when b 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de [ \u00f02; 1\u00de, we have that lim x!1 w\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00fe1, which implies that there exists some positive integer m 0 such that w\u00f0x\u00de > 0 for x ! m 0 . Hence, by Proposition B.2,k c\u00f0SF\u00de < k c\u00f0Homo\u00de whenever the minimum degree in the SF network is greater than m 0 . On the other hand, when b 2 \u00f01; 2\u00de, since lim x!1 w\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00c01,k c\u00f0SF\u00de >k c\u00f0Homo\u00de whenever the minimum degree in the SF network is greater than some positive integer m 0 . The remaining cases stated in the Theorem can be proved similarly.\u0657",
