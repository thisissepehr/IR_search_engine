            "text": "For over 2 decades, intestinal transplantation has presented a significant challenge for both clinicians and scientists worldwide because of the difficulty in controlling allograft rejection without imposing a significant risk of infection or drug-related morbidity. After initial case experience with isolated small bowel transplantation, [1] [2] [3] [4] tacrolimus was introduced in 1990, allowing more pronounced clinical progress. The initial challenges [5] with intestinal transplantation included technical issues, sepsis, rejection, and development of necessary clinical expertise with immunosuppression for both maintenance therapies as well as for management of rejection episodes. Further technical improvements in both donor intestine recovery and recipient surgery, [6] [7] [8] better understanding of infectious complications, [9] and novel immunosuppression regimens [10] [11] [12] [13] have significantly improved patient and graft survival. Other important achievements that have contributed to decreased mortality have been improved postoperative infectious prophylaxis and serial viral load monitoring with pre-emptive therapy for cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections, with subsequent reduction in the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs). [14] Despite these advances, areas needing ongoing improvement include reduction of mortality and late graft loss. The Intestinal Transplant Registry (see section 1.1) reports sepsis (54%), rejection (7%), and PTLD (3%) as ongoing causes of death. [15] Although acute cellular rejection has been well managed with current immunosuppression regimens, graft loss due to chronic rejection is a newer concern as longer term survival is being achieved. [16] The objective of this review is to summarize the outcomes and known adverse effects of current immunosuppression strategies in use in pediatric intestinal transplantation. The Intestinal Transplant Registry (ITR; see section 1.1), Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (OPTN SRTR; section 1.2), and single center reports (section 1.3) were used for compilation of data for this review.",

[23] Over the past decade, newer trends in immunosuppression have been seen and immunosuppressive regimens continue to evolve. Along with single-center reports of successful experience with rATG [19] and alemtuzumab, [24, 25] the 2009 OPTN SRTR annual report also documents increasing use of induction therapy with antibody preparations. [22] For example, the most common induction regimen [22] in 2008 was rATG, which was used in 34% of intestine recipients, followed by alemtuzumab (18%), muromonab CD3 (15%), and daclizumab (8%). The use of induction immunosuppression peaked in 2003 and stabilized to its current use in 60% of transplant recipients in 2008. [23] The immunosuppression regimen used for maintenance therapy prior to hospital discharge [22] in 2008 (figure 1) included tacrolimus plus corticosteroids in 55% of intestinal transplant recipients, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate and corticosteroids in 13%, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate in 11%, and tacrolimus alone in 11%; the maintenance regimen at 1-year post-transplant [22] for transplants carried out in 2007 (figure 2) was tacrolimus and corticosteroids in 47% of recipients and tacrolimus alone in 33%.",

Results from the use of these agents have been promising -the rates of long-term patient and graft survival have significantly increased. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] At CHP, 213 children received 235 intestine-containing allografts between May 1990 and December 2009. Mean age at transplantation was 5.1 -5.3 years and mean follow-up time was 58.9 -53.4 months. The incidence of acute rejection posttransplantation was 79% in the cyclophosphamide plus daclizumab cohort (n = 39), and has decreased to 68% in the rATG (n = 104) cohort and 36% in the alemtuzumab (n = 20) cohort, compared with 82% in the cohort in which no induction agent (n = 50) was used. Twenty-eight of the 213 (13%) subjects developed evidence of chronic rejection. The frequency of opportunistic infections and PTLD has also decreased over time. The incidence of tissue infection with cytomegalovirus was 26% in the cyclophosphamide plus daclizumab cohort, decreasing to 13% in the rATG plus alemtuzumab cohort. PTLD associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection also decreased from 23% in the cyclophosphamide plus daclizumab cohort to 11% in rATG cohort. This reduction is a coalescence of many contributing factors, such as improved postoperative infection prophylaxis, serial monitoring of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus viral loads, pre-emptive therapy with antiviral drugs, and reduction in immunosuppression when titers are elevated.",

As a result, a growing population is being managed with long-term immunosuppression after intestinal transplantation. Minimizing the adverse effects of conventional immunosuppression, such as opportunistic infection, malignancy, and growth retardation, is of vital importance in this challenging pediatric population. Adverse effects of common immunosuppressant drugs used in pediatric intestinal transplantation are summarized in table I. Current immunosuppressive strategies are aimed at reducing these adverse effects by evolving regimens that incorporate drug monitoring, combining different types of drugs in a novel way such that they complement each other, replacing one drug with another one exhibiting a different toxicity profile, and tailoring the immunosuppression according to appropriate clinical requirements. [17] Lifelong therapeutic monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations is required to regulate drug levels and dosage in order to avoid suboptimal concentrations leading to graft rejection, or toxic levels potentially leading to adverse effects, including Epstein-Barr virus-related PTLD and nephrotoxicity. Also, in patients with refractory rejection despite optimal intensification of immunosuppression, the risk of over-immunosuppression, including opportunistic infections and malignancies, have to be balanced with the consequences of graft loss due to rejection. In some instances, enterectomy and re-transplantation [36] may be preferable to severe infectious or malignant adverse effects.",

Positive T-cell lymphocytotoxic crossmatch increased the frequency and severity of rejection after isolated intestinal transplantation. In our analysis of 103 consecutive primary small bowel transplantation recipients, 18% of recipients with a positive T-cell crossmatch and 21% of small-bowel transplantation recipients with complement-dependent cytotoxicity-anti-HLA panel reactive antibody (CDC-PRA) titers of >15% experienced graft loss. [50] In an effort to improve post-transplant outcomes after intestinal transplantation, an intravenous immunoglobulinbased immunomodulation protocol for sensitized small bowel transplant candidates was studied by Gondolesi et al. [51] A stepwise protocol included level 1 treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin 200 mg kg every other week for a total of two doses, level 2 treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin 500 mg kg every other week for a total of two doses, level 3 treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin 1000 mg kg with plasmapheresis three times per week if two venous access sites were available, otherwise mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily), and level 4 treatment with rituximab 375 mg m 2 every other week for a total of four doses, with escalation to the next level of treatment if there was no significant decrease in PRA titers with the previous treatment. The transplant was performed regardless of the PRA titer if the crossmatch was negative. All transplanted patients responded to level 2 of therapy, and the mean pretreatment PRA titer in transplanted patients decreased from 66.2% to 25.5% at the end of treatment. Only one of six patients required level 4 treatment. This patient's PRA titers remained >90%, representing treatment failure. The authors concluded that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment can desensitize patients on a waiting list, as evidenced by a decrease in PRA titers, resulting in excellent post-transplant outcomes. Although there was no significant decrease in the incidence of acute rejection between the two cohorts with low and high PRA, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of corticosteroid-resistant rejections.",
