Real-time PCR generated 12 additional positive results that were later resolved as true positives using a manual DNA extraction and a commercial real-time PCR ( Figure 3A ). All 12 PCR-positive culture-negative results were detected following homogenization protocol, whereas 11 were detected following nucleic acid extraction ( Figure 3A) . The single discordant result between the molecular assays had a Cp value of 37.22, suggesting that it may be attributed to sampling error (Poisson distribution) at low concentrations of template [34] . Since the internal control also failed to amplify in this sample, the negative result could also be attributed to PCR inhibition. Upon repeat processing by automated and manual nucleic acid extractions, positive results were obtained. Therefore, the original specimen result was considered a false negative. Overall, compared to the modified gold standard, the sensitivity of the inhouse real-time PCR following homogenization with heat treatment or nucleic acid extraction was approximately equivalent at 100% (89.7-100%) and 97.4% (86.4-97.4%), respectively (Table 3 ).

Rapid specimen throughput and excellent performance characteristics make them an appealing alternative to traditional culture methods; however, cost limits their use in many clinical laboratories. Both the recovery of nucleic acids using extraction and the PCR reaction itself contribute to the cost. We have shown that combining a crude extraction method like homogenization with heat treatment [27] and an in-house real-time PCR [18] is a cost effective strategy for the detection HAdV from swabs submitted in UTM. Homogenization uses multidirectional motion to disrupt cells through contact with silica beads and the heat treatment [27, 28] . In combination with a subsequent heat treatment to inactivate heat-labile PCR inhibitors, this crude mechanical lysis had been shown to be a cost-effective method to recover viral DNA from swabs transported in UTM [27] . The performance characteristics of this approach were equivalent to using traditional nucleic acid extraction and both molecular methods far exceeded those obtained with virus culture. Replacing the nucleic acid extraction with the homogenization protocol did not affect the analytical (or clinical) sensitivity of the real-time PCR (Figure 2 and Table 3 ).
