Short-circuit currents (I SC ) were measured, showing an increase by E2 and P in a dose-dependent manner. The Na,K-ATPase subunits -\u2423 1 and -\u2424 1 were detected by Western blotting, but total expression was not significantly altered. Furthermore, all three epithelial Na \u03e9 channel (ENaC) subunits -\u2423, -\u2424, and -\u2425 were detected, with trends toward a higher expression in the presence of E2 and P. Real-time PCR revealed an increase of \u2423and \u2424-ENaC expression but no alteration of \u2425-ENaC. In addition, the mRNA expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Na,K-ATPase-\u2424 1 subunit were elevated in the presence of E2 and P. Single-channel patch clamp analysis demonstrated putative highly selective and nonselective cation channels in the analyzed cells, with a higher percentage of responsive patches under the influence of E2 and P. We conclude that E2 and P increased Na \u03e9 transport in alveolar epithelial cells by enhancing the expression and activity of",

Na \u03e9 enters the cells through epithelial Na \u03e9 channels (ENaC) in the apical membrane and is extruded by Na,K-ATPases in the basolateral membrane, creating an osmotic gradient for the movement of fluid out of the alveolar space (1) . This active vectorial Na \u03e9 transport is mainly responsible for alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and is crucial for postnatal survival, as shown by mice lacking the pore-forming \u2423-subunit of ENaC (2) . Furthermore, survival of adults with acute RDS (ARDS) is related to the efficiency of their AFC (3) . Preterm infants with RDS had reduced airway epithelial Na \u03e9 transport (4) and reduced ENaC expression (5) compared with preterm infants without RDS or term infants, and decreased AFC has been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of RDS (6) . Therefore, mechanisms or treatments to up-regulate lung epithelial vectorial Na \u03e9 transport and AFC may improve survival and decrease morbidity of preterm infants and adults with respiratory distress.",

Moreover, preterm infants suffering from RDS showed a reduced estrogen and progesterone (P) plasma concentration (12, 13) . In cystic fibrosis, a disease characterized not only by defective Cl \u03ea secretion but also by Na \u03e9 hyperabsorption (14) , males have a better prognosis (15) , possibly because stimulating effects of female sex hormones on Na \u03e9 absorption lead to increased mucus thickness.

Values are shown as percentage of the density obtained from cells grown in medium 1 (all bars, n \u03ed 6). Medium 4 (v), medium 5 (t), and medium 6 (3). creases of baseline I SC , I amil , I ouab , ouab max , and amil max in monolayers exposed to E2 up to 0.28 M (medium 4) are consistent with stimulatory effects on both ENaC and Na, K-ATPase. High concentrations of P (1-2.8 M, medium 6 and 5) were associated with diminished currents and also a trend toward reduced Na,K-ATPase protein expression, which may indicate toxicity. A high P concentration combined with a low E2 concentration, as in medium 5 (2.7 M), predominantly increased ENaC activity, as shown by stimulatory effects on amil max but not ouab max . Hence, the decreases of baseline I SC in media 5 and 6 were probably caused by a diminished Na,K-ATPase activity. Smaller stimulatory effects on apical Na \u03e9 channel activity were also seen using media 2 and 3, resembling E2 and P concentrations similar to natural conditions during rat gestation (23) . It was also shown that the combination of E2 and P (e.g. medium 5 with 0.0037 M E2) has a higher impact on epithelial Na \u03e9 transport than E2 alone as in medium 2 (0.01 M E2). This would suggest a more pronounced influence of P, but considering the effects of medium 3 with a higher P, but lower E2 concentration than medium 4, a more complex interaction between intracellular E2 and P signaling must be assumed. The notion of a physiologic role of female sex steroids on lung epithelial ion transport is further supported by a study of pig fetuses subjected to prenatal pharmacologic E2 and P withdrawal, which resulted in decreased amiloride-sensitive AFC (17) .",

Apical Na \u03e9 channels have been sparsely investigated, yielding results consistent with the findings described in this work. ENaC subunit mRNA expression has been shown to be enhanced in rat kidney cells (24) . Higher levels of \u2423-ENaC were detected in female rat lungs compared with males, and combined administration of E2 and P to immature or ovarectomized rats increased pulmonary mRNA levels of \u2423and \u2425-ENaC after 24 h (18) . Furthermore, monolayers of alveolar epithelial cells derived from immature rats responded to E2 and P with an increase in amiloridesensitive I SC , using the same E2 and P concentrations as in our medium 5 (18) . However, no investigations regarding the Na,K-ATPase were included.",

Thus, a higher number of active ENaC induced by E2 and P is in accordance with the I SC measurements.",

The strongest increase of \u2423-ENaC mRNA was observed for the P-rich medium 5, which was also showing the highest amil max . Unlike the whole animal experiments (18), we did not find an increase of \u2425-ENaC mRNA expression but an elevation of \u2424-ENaC. These results also demonstrate a differential regulation of ENaC subunits by sex steroids. Furthermore, this study shows increased expression of Na,K-ATPase-\u2424 1 subunit by E2 and P at all tested concentrations. Overexpression of the \u2424 1 -subunit of the Na,K-ATPase alone was previously shown to increase vectorial Na \u03e9 transport, whereas overexpression of the \u2423 1 -subunit did not have any effect (21) , because the \u2424 1 -subunit was the rate-limiting component in the assembly of Na,K-ATPases (25, 26) . Therefore, the observed increased expression of the Na,K-ATPase-\u2424 1 subunit might account for the detected elevation of I ouab under E2 supplementation. CFTR mRNA expression was shown to be increased by combined treatment of E2 and P after 24 h (18) , which we also demonstrated on the fourth day after hormone supplementation. These data show the impact of E2 and P on the transcriptional level of participating ion transporters. E2 and P supplementation resulted in a trend toward a reduced expression of ER-\u2424, which has been described for the expression of ER in the brain (27) ; however, to our knowledge, it has not yet been described in the lung.",

The polyclonal origin of the antibodies resulted in detection of several bands. For evaluation by densitometry, the band with the best-fitting molecular weight was selected. Specificity was further confirmed by experiments with positive controls. Because of the high variability of such measurements, a large number of Western blots would be needed for statistical verification at this effect size. Expression of Na,K-ATPase remained essentially unchanged in culture media 2 and 4. The protein expression results do not completely rule out a minor increase sufficient to produce the electrophysiologically detected changes, because whole cell lysates also include proteins stored in the endoplasmatic reticulum and blotting studies cannot be readily expected to detect small differences, as previously reported (8) .",

K \u03e9 channels in other tissues have been shown to be controlled by E2 (30, 31) . It is currently unknown whether K \u03e9 channels in epithelial cells are influenced by E2 or P. FDLE cells are known to perform mostly not only Na absorption but also, to a smaller extent, Cl \u03ea secretion (8) . Therefore, we used the specific inhibitors of epithelial Na \u03e9 transport, amiloride and ouabain, to attribute the effects of hormone supplementation to the ENaC and Na,K-ATPase transport activity. Furthermore, experiments performed in Cl \u03ea -free solution yielded similar results (not shown).",

ENaC activity seems to be most strongly stimulated by high P concentrations, whereas the Na,K-ATPase function seems to be mainly controlled by E2, which is a new finding. E2 and P may thus improve AFC and hasten the resolution of pulmonary edema, which may contribute to positive effects of E2 on RDS of infants (10, 16) and the sex-related differences in the survival of the ARDS (3). In cystic fibrosis, stimulatory actions of E2 and P may worsen the overactivity of ENaC associated with the disease (14) , which may explain why the prognosis of affected males is better than that of females (15) .",
