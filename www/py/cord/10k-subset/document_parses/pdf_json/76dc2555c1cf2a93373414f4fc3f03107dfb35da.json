Particular attention will be paid to the methods used in the investigations, since methodological differences are clearly responsible for differences in results. Most of the etiologic agents, other than influenza, were identified during the late 1950s or thereafter, so the greatest attention will be given to studies conducted during that period.

Overall frequency was lower than that reported in prior studies, perhaps because of the concentration on virus isolation rather than illness ascertainment. Seasonality was apparent, but it was difficult to show reproducible differences by month. Reporting of fever was felt to be a particular problem, since it was the caregiver of the household, typically the mother, who would report on the illness and who often did not take a child's temperature.
