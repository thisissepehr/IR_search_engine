Gastric emptying may be affected by infant maturity, medications (e.g., methylxanthines, mydriatics), feed composition (formula versus breastmilk), feeding method (bolus versus continuous feedings), infant position, tube position, and infant state (e.g., respiratory distress, infection). Theoretically, evaluation of gastric residuals may cause harm: for example, repetitive negative pressure from aspiration may injure sensitive gastric mucosa, and discarding gastric residuals may result in the loss of essential gastric enzymes, gastric acid, and important nutrients [4] .
