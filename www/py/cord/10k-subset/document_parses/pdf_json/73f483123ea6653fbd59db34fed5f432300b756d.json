For such infectious diseases, the resulting model is SEIR (susceptible S, exposed E, infectious I, removed R) epidemic type. The study on SEIR-type epidemic dynamical models is a very important subject in the mathematical theory of epidemiology, and in the last two decades there have been a number of researches on modeling, theoretical analysis, and applications. Continuous SEIR-type epidemic models described by the differential equations have been widely studied.

In [\uf63a\uf63e], the authors applied Micken's discretization method to obtain a discrete SEIR epidemic model. The positivity of solutions and the existence and stability of equilibrium are discussed. The design of a state observer for the model is tackled. Some sufficient conditions to ensure the asymptotic stability of the observer are provided in terms of a matrix inequality. In [\uf63a\uf640], the authors studied a discrete plant virus disease model with roguing and replanting, which is derived from the continuous case by using the backward Euler method. The basic reproduction number R \uf639 is obtained. It is showed that the disease-free equilibrium is globally attractive if R \uf639 \u2264 \uf6dc, and otherwise, the disease is permanent if R \uf639 > \uf6dc. In [\uf63a\uf641, \uf63b\uf639], the authors proposed a class of discrete SEIS epidemic models with bilinear incidence, which is established from the corresponding continuous SEIS epidemic model by applying the well-known backward difference scheme. The positivity of solutions and the permanence of the model are established. Furthermore, using the Lyapunov function method, the authors proved that if the basic reproduction number R \uf639 \u2264 \uf6dc, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and if R \uf639 > \uf6dc, then the endemic equilibrium exists and is globally asymptotically stable.",

Since S(n) > \uf639 and f (S(n), I(n)) > \uf639 for all n \u2265 \uf639, from the second equation of model (\uf63a) we further have E(n) > E(\uf639)( \uf6dc \uf6dc+\u03bc \uf63a +\u03b4 ) n \u2265 \uf639 for all n \u2265 \uf639.
