Specifically, within the midbrain only substantia nigra atrophy predicted executive and visuospatial performance, whereas hippocampal atrophy predicted poor episodic memory performance and lower CSF aBeta. These findings provide valuable insight into the underlying pathophysiology of different cognitive impairments in PD and support the dual-syndrome hypothesis. Over 100,000 carotid revascularization procedures are done annually in the US for asymptomatic carotid arterial stenosis. The safety of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), and the efficacy of medical therapy in altering the progression of atherosclerosis have improved. Therefore, the applicability of prior randomized trials in asymptomatic carotid stenosis to current treatment decisions has been called into question. The aim of the NINDSfunded CREST-2 is to compare CEA and intensive medical therapy (IMT) versus IMT alone (n51240), and CAS and IMT versus IMT alone (n51240), through two parallel randomized clinical trials at approximately 120 medical centers, including collaboration with NIH-StrokeNet. The composite primary outcome is any stroke or death within 44 days after randomization or ipsilateral ischemic stroke thereafter up to 4 years. Secondary outcomes include cognitive function, which is assessed on a regular schedule through computer-assisted telephone interview. IMT is directed centrally and includes tight control of blood pressure (systolic target < 140 mm Hg) and cholesterol (LDL target < 70 mg/ dl) as well as lifestyle coaching. As of March 18, 2016, 87 centers have been approved to randomize by the CREST-2 Site Selection Committee, and site selection is ongoing for up to 150 sites. 202 patients have been randomized. The Surgical and Interventional Management Committees have credentialed 261 surgeons and 98 interventionists. An additional 131 interventionists have been approved to submit additional cases via the CREST-2 Companion Registry which provides a CMS-reimbursed pathway for full credentialing in CREST-2. An update regarding the numbers of centers certified, surgeons and interventionists credentialed, and cases randomized will be provided.",

            "text": "[ In degenerative cerebellar ataxias, Purkinje neurons undergo progressive simplification and degeneration of the dendritic arbor prior to cell loss. Although dendritic degeneration strongly correlates with motor impairment in many models of cerebellar ataxia, the mechanism behind this pathologic dendritic remodeling is not well understood. In a mouse model of the inherited ataxia spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), we investigated the hypothesis that Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration is a result of a pathological increase in intrinsic dendritic excitability. Intrinsic dendritic excitability is a measure of neuronal dendrites' ability to regulate their membrane potential, and appropriate control of dendritic excitability is critical for protecting Purkinje neuron dendrites from toxic calcium loading. In our electrophysiologic recordings, we found that SCA1 Purkinje neurons show increased dendritic excitability throughout the course of dendritic degeneration, and we also found that this increased excitability is observed in association with reduced expression and function of several potassium channels. Enhancing activity of these potassium channels normalizes dendritic excitability and prevents dendritic degeneration, supporting a causal connection between increased dendritic excitability and pathologic dendritic remodeling. In our efforts to identify a downstream effector which might mediate excitability-dependent dendritic degeneration, we have found a progressive increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity that correlates with dendritic degeneration in SCA1 Purkinje neurons. Increased PKC activity has been shown to cause Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration in vitro and in vivo. Our studies found that increased PKC activity in SCA1 Purkinje neurons is linked to excitability-dependent calcium entry, suggesting that increased PKC activity might therefore be the mechanistic link between increased excitability and dendritic remodeling in SCA1 mice. We found evidence of increased PKC activity in Purkinje neurons in post-mortem tissue from patients with SCA1, as well as in post-mortem tissue from patients with multiple system atrophy, a sporadic cerebellar ataxia. These results indicate that increased PKC activity could underlie Purkinje neuron dendritic remodeling in diverse causes of cerebellar ataxia, and suggest that reducing dendritic membrane excitability and normalizing protein kinase C activity may represent a shared therapeutic strategy in degenerative ataxias.

Mathews, Giovanni Coppola and The Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics and the GTS GWAS Replication Initiative. Boston, MA; Los Angeles, CA; Nashville, TN; Alexandropouli, Greece and Gainesville, FL Background: Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with one of the highest familial recurrence rates among non-Mendelian neuropsychiatric diseases. Despite this high heritability, no genome-wide significant TS susceptibility genes have been identified to date. Given the presence of rare recurrent genomic deletions and duplications, i.e., copy number variants (CNVs), in other developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, we examined the role of rare CNVs in a large, European ancestry TS case-control sample.",

The human frontal lobe has greatly increased in size and complexity compared to other mammals or non-human primates. To study the manner in which this region continues to develop postnatally, we followed young neurons from the walls of the lateral ventricles and sub-ventricular zone (V-SVZ) to their final cortical destinations using highresolution MRI, histology, and time-lapse confocal microscopy. We discovered a prominent and transient population of Doublecortin (DCX)1 migrating young neurons in a stream we refer to as the Anterior Arch. These cells were distributed widely throughout the frontal lobe invading multiple cortical areas in the first three months of life. DCX1 cells within the Arch were organized into four distinct regions (or tiers): 1) subventricular I, 2) subventricular II, 3) perivascular, and 4) in the developing white matter. The orientation of elongated DCX1 cells suggested that migratory neurons closer to the ventricular wall, in Tiers 1 and 2, were largely dispersing tangentially, while those in Tiers 3 and 4 have a more radial orientation. These young neurons expressed markers of interneurons and their entry into the anterior cingulate cortex (a major target of the Arch used for quantification) was correlated with the emergence of specific subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (NPY, Somatostatin and Calretinin) . The distribution of Calbindin and Parvalbumin subtypes did not change with age in a similar fashion. DCX1 cells also expressed transcription factors associated with the ventral progenitor regions, the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE). Altogether, these data reveal a major migration of young neurons into the frontal lobe at periods of brain development that may contribute to changes to the neural circuit composition and its maturation during early infancy. The late development of neurons in the Arch may be related to plasticity in the developing human frontal lobe and defects in this migration could result in circuit defects that underlie neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Houston, TX and Boston, MA Absence epilepsy is a common childhood disorder featuring frequent cortical spike-wave seizures associated with behavioral arrest. The uniquely stereotyped EEG signature is assumed to reflect the global synchrony of neurons firing in unison among all cortical layers, disrupting complex patterns of synaptic integration. However, network activity of cortical neuronal populations in superficial layers has never been analyzed during seizures compared with the resting state. Using the calcium indicator Gcamp6 with in vivo 2photon calcium imaging and simultaneous electrocorticography, we examined the collective temporal and spatial activity profiles of layer 2/3 neurons and neuropil during spikewave seizure activity in the visual cortex of 9 stargazer mice, a monogenic absence epilepsy model. The calcium signal is an indirect but well-established surrogate measure of electrical activity in cortical neurons. With a mean6SEM of 30.9 6 4.3 neurons and 13.6 6 1.3 patches of neuropil per dataset, we show that both neurons and neuropil in superficial layers of visual cortex are only sparsely and nonuniformly coupled to EEG synchronization. Unexpectedly, the majority of neurons (81.2 6 3.5%, mean6SEM) were significantly less active in the ictal compared to the interictal state. Only a small proportion of cells were significantly more active during seizures (4.1 6 1.5%). In contrast, 99.3%60.7% of neuropil patches had significantly reduced activity during the ictal state with only 1 patch of neuropil showing no significant change. When aligning the activity from all neurons and neuropil with the onset of seizures, the ictally suppressed neurons and neuropil show a significant but gradual reduction in activity several seconds before the first spike of the seizure. When aligned to the last seizure spike, activity returned to baseline within one second in the neuropil, while neurons lagged behind by 2-5 seconds. Furthermore, seizure-participation dynamics within this upper layer pool are not static, but fluctuate on a flexible (seconds to days) time scale within and across seizure episodes, indicating a loose and temporally transient community structure. Spatial patterns showed similar flexibility. Our results demonstrate that the conventional view of cortical neuronal ensemble behavior during a generalized spikewave seizure as a fixed hypersynchronous unit overlooks a distinct separation of superficial cortical networks from stereotyped pathophysiological thalamocortical oscillations. This complex portrait of dynamic neuronal participation has major implications for deciphering cortical network excitability during hyperactive EEG states.

In the former, the vocal folds hyper-abduct, making the voice breathy and weak; in the latter, the vocal folds abnormally adduct, making the voice strained or strangled.

A Translational Approach to Analyze Spatial and Temporal Gait Parameters: Normal and Parkinsonian Gait Signatures in Mice and Human Lauren Broom, Audrey Worley, Lara Wagenaar, Brian Ellison, Aron Buchman, Jeffrey Hausdorff and Veronique G. VanderHorst. Boston, MA; Tel Aviv, Israel and Chicago Impairment of gait can manifest itself in various ways and be due to pathology at any CNS level. This implicates involvement of multiple CNS pathways in gait control, but these circuitries remain poorly understood. Powerful functional anatomical approaches are now available to unravel these circuitries in mouse models. However, a major hurdle for translating between mouse and human models involves the differences between quadruped gait in mice and biped gait in humans. We present a novel model to analyze spatial and temporal gait parameters as a function of velocity in both mouse models and human subjects.",

The mechanisms by which B cell antigen presentation directs the propagation of CD4 T cell auto-reactivity in an antigen-specific, major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII)-dependent manner during multiple sclerosis (MS) remain unclear. We have previously shown that antigen presentation exclusively by B cells can be sufficient to propagate CNS inflammatory demyelination in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We hypothesized that the delay in onset of disease is observed when B cells are the exclusive antigen presenting cell during EAE is due to restrictions on B cells for access to central nervous system (CNS) antigens. We sought to determine the timing and capacity of B cells to capture and present antigen to propagate encephalitogenic CD4 T cell responses during autoimmune neuro-inflammation. We induced passive EAE using encephalitogenic CD4 T cell lines that target myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Experimental recipients included WT mice, mice with MHCII expression restricted to B cells that express a higher frequency of MOG-specific receptor (termed IgHMOGxBMHCII), and tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible MHCII expression exclusively by B cells that express a higher frequency of antigen receptor for MOG (termed IgHMOGxBTam-MHCII). Induction of MHCII expression by B cells following TAM administration was rapid and reached maximal expression within three days. IgHMOGxBTam-MHCII mice were resistant to passive EAE until TAM administration. Encephalitogenic T cells facilitate initiation of EAE by B cells independent of MHCII, as the number of days before onset of disease shrinks as the number of days T cells are present before TAM administration increases. This coincides with a build up of B cells in the meninges without B Cells infiltration into the spinal cord parenchyma during EAE. Based on our data, we conclude that B cells are capable of accessing CNS myelin targets via localization to the meninges and rapidly eliciting CD4 T cell-dependent neuro-inflammation upon cognate interactions. However, coordination of these interactions depends upon cognateindependent T cell signals that ultimately dictate the tempo of neuro-inflammation mediated by B cell antigen presentation during EAE. In MS, which is traditionally considered a white matter (WM) disease, the primary role of gray matter (GM) demyelination as a pathological substrate of disability progression has been recently recognized. A recently developed quantitative MRI method, fast macromolecular proton fraction mapping (MPF) has shown a promise as a biomarker of myelin in human and animal studies with a particular advantage of sensitivity to GM demyelination.",

These features are associated with cortical involvement, illustrating that damage in MS is not limited to the white matter. Cortical demyelination is a feature of MS pathology, but is undetectable on standard MRI sequences. To develop effective interventions for prevention or repair of progressive MS, it is critical to understand the dynamic relationship between cortical demyelination and remyelination, as well as the effect on underlying axons.

Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is a widely used antiepileptic drug for partial seizures, developed through structural variation of carbamazepine. Although it has a lower risk of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) than carbamazepine, the cADRs ranging from maculopapular eruption (MPE) to the more severe Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis still limits the use of OXC in some patients. A few human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related genetic risk factors for carbamazepine-induced cADR have been identified.

Distinct Modes of Seizure-Like Hyperexcitability as Revealed in Drosophila Sodium Channel Mutants Atulya Iyengar, Atsushi Ueda, Junko Kasuya, Scott Gratz, Kate O'Connor-Giles, Toshi Kitamoto and Chun-Fang Wu. Iowa City, IA and Madison, WI Mutations in genes encoding voltage-gated sodium (Nav), potassium (Kv), and calcium (Cav) channels are associated with a variety of heritable epilepsy syndromes. Interestingly, molecular lesions in homologous ion channel genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lead to a variety of striking behaviors. Classic examples include many Shaker (Sh, Kv1) and ether a go-go (eag, Kv10) channel mutants displaying ether-induced leg shaking, and some paralytic Nav1 channel mutants showing high temperature-induced paralysis. Neurophysiological analyses of these mutants have linked ion channel gene mutations with altered cellular excitability and synaptic transmission properties, leading to aberrant circuit plasticity and motor pattern generation. This offers opportunities for systematic studies linking identified molecular lesions to functional modifications at both cellular and circuit levels in a genetic model system, Drosophila, in which shorter generation time and high fecundity facilitates a high-throughput analysis.",

            "text": "In this report, we present a novel leg-shaking mutant, Shaker-wings-down (Swd) that displays severe ether-induced shaking and convulsions associated with seizure discharges. Surprisingly, we mapped Swd, to a single non-polar amino acid substitution in the D3-S4 voltage sensor of paralytic, the only gene encoding Nav channels in Drosophila. At the larval neuromuscular junction, we demonstrated extreme excitability in motor axons reminiscent of the Kv double mutant eag Sh, but normal synaptic transmission properties. The observed neuronal hyperexcitability led to uncoordinated walking, abnormal motor program outputs, and aberrant spike discharges across the nervous system. To demonstrate that the entire functional consequences, from neuronal hyperexcitabilty to seizure behavior, arose from a single amino acid substitution in the Nav channel mutation, we adopted a CRISPR-based genome editing strategy. The characteristic behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the Swd mutation, either generated in the original chemical mutagenesis screen or by CRISPR genome editing of the same amino acid replacement, rules out contributions from unknown genetic Background effects and defines a neomorphic mutation of the paralytic Nav channel gene that results in a unique hyperexcitability phenotype. Together, these findings represent a potentially important mechanism within the Nav channel that leads to specific neuronal hyperexcitability and neural circuit dysfunction as delineate by the Swd mutation. Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital eye movement disorder defined by limited outward gaze of the eye, and retraction of the eye on attempted inward gaze. Previous MRI and EMG studies of patients with DRS found that the abducens nerve was absent or hypoplastic, and the lateral rectus extraocular muscle was aberrantly innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve instead of the abducens nerve. Although this pathology was well characterized, the developmental etiology of DRS remained unknown, in large part due to the lack of a robust animal model. In this study, we use a combination of human genetics and a new mouse model of DRS to provide evidence that the primary cause of the disorder is a failure of abducens nerve development. We identify three loss-of-function mutations in the gene MAFB in patients with DRS, and an additional dominant-negative mutation in MAFB causing both DRS and deafness. By using genotype-phenotype correlations in humans and Mafb knockout mice, as well as in vitro studies of the dominant-negative mutation, we propose a threshold model for variable loss of MAFB function causing DRS and deafness. By performing embryonic whole mount preparations and orbital dissections in Mafb knockout mice, we demonstrate that selectively disrupting abducens nerve development is sufficient to cause secondary innervation of the lateral rectus muscle by aberrant branches of the oculomotor nerve. We observe that these aberrant branches of the oculomotor nerve form at developmental decision regions in close proximity to target extraocular muscles. Thus, we present genetic and developmental evidence that the primary etiology of DRS is failure of the abducens nerve to fully innervate the lateral rectus muscle in early development. This has important clinical implications, since our findings suggest that a wide variety of insults to the developing abducens nerve in utero can cause DRS.",

            "text": "Conclusions: SSRI use is not associated with improved survival in MSA. However, SSRI use was associated with higher rates of parkinsonism and falls, concerning for a negative effect on motor function in MSA. Clinical features of Parkinson disease (PD) differ in men and women. In addition to age of onset and motor phenotype, sex differences also characterize non-motor symptoms of PD including mild cognitive impairments. Numerous studies have explored mechanisms of estrogen protection in relation to these differences. However, using bilateral neostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to model the mild cognitive impairments of PD in rats, we discovered a link between circulating androgens and the ability of lesions to induce cognitive deficits. Specifically, in male rats and gonadectomized (GDX) male rats supplemented with testosterone (GDX-T) androgen levels are physiologic; while these subjects readily master cognitive demands in Barnes maze testing, after 6-OHDA lesions both groups show striking deficits in working memory and behavioral flexibility. In contrast, in GDX rats and GDX rats supplemented with E (GDX-E) androgen levels are low; while these subjects normally struggle with Barnes maze acquisition, following experimental DA lesions performance in both groups dramatically improves. Here we present parallel findings for group-specific effects of neostriatal DA lesions on neuronal firing in the subthalamic nucleus (STN)-a pivotal node in the frontostriatal circuits that mediate executive function and a key site of pathophysiology and therapeutic intervention in PD. Specifically, single units recorded in the STN of urethane-anesthetized male and GDX-T rats show normal patterns of slow, tonic firing; after 6-OHDA lesions mean frequencies and phasic bursting in STN neurons are significantly increased in these two groups. In contrast, in nonlesioned GDX and GDX-E rats STN firing is both faster than normal and often punctuated by high frequency bursting; after 6-OHDA lesions both measures of activity and reduced/restored to control values. Together, these data suggest that in male rats the ability of neostriatal 6-OHDA lesions to induce cognitive deficits and perhaps functionally related electrophysiological abnormalities in the STN is powerfully modulated by circulating androgen levels. Thus, while male vulnerability to aspects of PD including its cognitive signs has stimulated studies of potentially protective effects of circulating estrogens, the present results suggest that examining roles for circulating androgens may be equally important for understanding PD. Further, androgens may prove especially relevant for managing cognitive impairments which are unaffected or exacerbated by most therapies used to treat PD, including deep brain stimulation of the STN. S132. Apical Dendrite Degeneration, a New Cellular Pathology in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Baris Genc, Javier H. Jara, Peter Pytel, Raymond P. Roos, Marsel M. Mesulam, Changiz Geula, Eileen H. Bigio and Hande Ozdinler. Chicago, IL Upper motor neurons [corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) in mice and Betz cells in humans] are important components of motor neuron circuitry because of their unique ability to initiate and modulate voluntary movement by receiving, integrating and conveying cerebral cortex input into spinal cord targets. Degeneration of Betz cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was documented as early as 1885, and has been accepted as a defining characteristic distinguishing ALS from other motor neuron diseases, the timing and the extent of Betz cell degeneration has been actively debated. Many studies suggested a degeneration starting from neuromuscular junction and moving towards cerebral cortex. This \"dying-back\" hypothesis diminished the importance of Betz cells as an important contributor to disease pathology, as it predicted that their death was a consequence of downstream events. We find that Betz cells of both familial and sporadic ALS as well as ALS/FTD patients display profound degeneration, especially at the site of their apical dendrite, whereas Betz cells of Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls retain cellular integrity. The present study demonstrates the presence of apical dendrite defects in a broad spectrum of ALS, including sALS, fALS and FTD-ALS, but not in AD patients and controls. These profound cytoarchitectural defects in apical dendrites support the hypothesis that the cortical connectivity defects are an early event in ALS, and further suggest Betz cells as a novel cellular target for therapeutic interventions. Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition for which no therapy is definitively proven to halt or slow the relentless progression of symptoms. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS) is effective in advanced and mid-stage PD for improving quality of life and motor symptoms and reducing medications. Preliminary data from a prospective, randomized pilot clinical trial suggests DBS in early stage PD reduces the relative risk of worsening for motor symptoms and complications of medical therapy compared to medication alone by 50-80% [1] .",

Repeat Associated Non-AUG Initiated Translation from GC Rich Repeats in Neurodegenerative Disease Peter K. Todd. Ann Arbor, MI Nucleotide repeat expansions underlie numerous human neurological disorders. Repeats can trigger toxicity through multiple pathogenic mechanisms, including RNA gain-offunction, protein gain-of-function, and protein loss-offunction pathways. Traditionally, inference of the underlying pathogenic mechanism derives from the repeat location, with dominantly inherited repeats within transcribed noncoding sequences eliciting toxicity predominantly as RNA via sequestration of specific RNA binding proteins. However, recent findings demonstrate that repeats outside of annotated open reading frames also trigger toxicity through a novel form of protein translational initiation known as repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. RAN translation contributes to hallmark pathological characteristics in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Fragile X-associated Tremor Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), by producing toxic homopolymeric or dipeptide repeat proteins. However, the specific sequence contexts and mechanisms underlying RAN translation remain largely unknown.",

This work suggests that many aspects of canonical translational initiation are conserved in RAN translation, but that there are differences in the sites and modes of initiation across repeats and even at different reading frames of the same repeats. Importantly, specific mRNA sequence features and protein factors can selectively mitigate RAN, and targeting these processes suppresses toxicity in animal models.

Because the RIVITaLISe trial was closed prematurely when only 29 patients finished pre-treatment baseline, the RIVITaLISe cohort became one of two independent validation cohorts used. Fifteen outcomes demonstrated significant progression over one year (D) in the predetermined analysis of the IPPoMS trial and seven out of these have been validated in both independent cohorts. Validated MRI outcomes had limited correlations with clinical scales, relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and recorded overlapping values between healthy subjects and MS patients with moderate-severe disability. Clinical measures were better correlated, even though each reflects a somewhat different disability domain. Therefore, using statistical modeling, we developed a combinatorial weight-adjusted disability score (CombiWISE) that integrates four clinical scales: expanded disability status scale (EDSS), Scripps neurological rating scale, 25 foot walk and nine hole peg test. Combi-WISE outperformed all clinical scales (D510.63%; p50.0004) and detected yearly changes in all three longitudinal progressive MS cohorts with comparable sensitivity to the best-performing MRI biomarkers. In contrast to MRI biomarkers, CombiWISE recorded no overlapping values between healthy subjects and disabled MS patients, had high SNR and predicted changes in EDSS in a longitudinal assessment of 98 progressive MS patients and in a cross-sectional cohort of 303 untreated subjects with MS, other neurological disorders, and healthy subjects.

Background: Relapses in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) contribute to long-term disability and often indicate the need to switch disease-modifying therapy. In clinical practice, new symptoms concerning for MS relapses, especially if mild, are under-reported. In phase 3 clinical trials in relapsing MS, relapse is usually the primary outcome and typically requires a documented worsening on neurologic exam. Study participants are asked to notify the research team promptly if new symptoms occur so that, when indicated, a neurologic exam can be performed to confirm a relapse has occurred. However, under-reporting of symptoms in clinical trials is also common, thus reducing relapse detection. This phenomenon is of concern as it leads to inflation of trial sample sizes, escalating costs and delaying availability of new treatments.

It is thought to be an autoimmune disease targeting CNS myelin. Strong evidence indicates that MS risk is impacted by environmental factors, including diet and obesity. Several recent studies showed that obesity during childhood/young adulthood confers increased risk of developing MS. The biological mechanisms relating obesity to MS is not known. These can include changes in serum levels of cytokines/adipokines controlling systemic inflammation as well as in the gut microbiome, which can affect immune responses. We have previously shown that a regimen of calorie restriction is able to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the main MS animal model.

Co-Production of GM-CSF, IL-22, or IL-17F Identifies a Pathogenic High IL-17A-Producing T Cell Subset from MS Patients That Is Steroid Resistant Mark A. Jensen, Pretty Abraham, Anthony T. Reder and Barry G.W. Arnason. Rochester, MN and Chicago, IL Steroids speed recovery during MS relapses but ultimate deficit is lessened minimally at best suggesting that some tissue damage participants may be steroid resistant. Multiple cytokines are implicated in the pathogenic response of MS relapses. We analyzed circulating CD4 cells in MS (n511) and controls (n510) by flow cytometry for expressed cytokine pairs that might identify a steroid insensitive subpopulation focusing on toxic IL-17A and IFN-c and as partners, IL-22, IL-21, GM-CSF, IL-17F and IL-2. IL-17A cells that paired with GM-CSF, IL-22, or IL-17F produced 2 fold higher amounts of IL-17A than IL-17A cells not making these cytokines or IL-17A cells that paired with other cytokines (p<0.04 for each). Dual producers also made more IL-22 and IL-17F (p< 0.02 for each). IFN-c-secretors that also made GM-CSF or IL-2 made twice as much IFNc as other subsets (p<0.001 for each). Conversely, the IL-17A-IFN-c couplet made less IL-17A and IFN-c than single producers and less than other couplets (p< 0.04 for each).",

Cytokine pairs analyzed by flow included IL17A-GM-CSF and IL-17A-GM-CSF-IFN-c (high IL-17A producers), IL-17A-IFN-c (low IL-17A and IFN-c producers), IL-17A-IL-21, IFN-c-IL-2, and IFN-c-GM-CSF.

Introduction: Patients with amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis experience multiorgan failure and peripheral neuropathy from abnormal deposition of misfolded light chain (LC) proteins. Current therapies limit LC production but do not directly target deposits underlying multiorgan failure and neuropathy. NEOD001, a monoclonal antibody, targets misfolded LC and is thought to neutralize circulating LC aggregates and clear insoluble deposits. In an interim analysis of a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study in patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent organ dysfunction (NCT01707264; EudraCT2012-002683-27), monthly infusions of NEOD001 were safe and well tolerated. Organ responses compared favorably with those of traditional chemotherapy (Gertz et al. J Clin Oncol 2016). We report updated results from the escalation phase and new results from the expansion phase of this study, which includes patients with peripheral neuropathy.",

Since beneficial cognitive effects from right cerebellar tDCS have been found for both anodal and cathodal stimulation in healthy individuals, we will test the effect of anodal and cathodal stimulation in post-stroke aphasia. We hypothesized that Anodal tDCS (A-tDCS) or cathodal tDCS (C-tDCS) plus computerized naming therapy will result in improved naming performance for trained and untrained items from baseline to post-treatment compared to sham plus naming therapy. A randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, within-subject crossover trial design was utilized. Participants took part in 2 intervention periods of 15 computerized naming training sessions (3-5 sessions per week), with either tDCS 1 naming therapy or sham1 naming therapy, separated by 2 months. 3 participants received Anodal tDCS (A-TDCS) 1naming therapy and sham 1 naming therapy and the 3 participants received Cathodal tDCS (C-tDCS) 1 naming therapy and sham 1 naming therapy. 2 mA of A-tDCS or C-tDCS stimulation was induced between two 5 cm x 5 cm saline soaked sponges where one active electrode (anode in Group Anode or cathode in Group Cathode) was placed on the right cerebellum (1 cm under, and 4 cm lateral to the inion) and the reference electrode (cathode in Group Anode or anode in Group Cathode) was placed over the right shoulder.",

Differentiating between Subtypes of Primary Progressive Aphasia and Mild Cognitive Impairment on a Modified Version of the Frontal Behavioral Inventory Donna C. Tippett, Cornelia Demsky, Rajani Sebastian, Amy Wright, Cameron Davis and Argye E. Hillis. Baltimore, MD Behavioral assessment has been investigated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but has not been explored extensively in subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). We explored the ability of a modified version of the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI-mod) to discriminate between patients with distinct subtypes of PPA and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We hypothesized that individuals with nonfluent agrammatic PPA (nfaPPA) would have higher negative behavior scores than other groups and that individuals with semantic variant PPA (svPPA) would have higher disinhibition scores than other groups. Family members and/or caregivers of 87 individuals with PPA and MCI completed the FBI-mod (logopenic PPA, lvPPA n529; mean age 70.551 6.73; nfaPPA n520, mean age 66.651 10.94; svPPA n515, mean age 67.601 5.74; unclassifiable PPA, UnCPPA n 57, mean age 70.291 7.06, MCI n516; mean age 69.01 12.09). The groups were not significantly different in age, education, or disease duration. There were no significant differences between the groups on ANOVA for negative behaviors (p50.156, F51.71), although the svPPA and UnCPPA had the highest mean scores on this portion of the FBI-mod and individuals with MCI had the lowest mean score. The disinhibition scores were significantly different (p50.022, F53.02), with svPPA having the highest mean score. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of having svPPA was significantly higher (OR 1.04 [1.01-1.09]) for every 1 point on the disinhibition score (but not negative behavior score; ns), independent of age, disease duration, and gender (p50.012). When comparing negative and disinhibition scores (in percent), negative scores were significantly higher in all groups. The frequency of \"severe\" or \"3\" ratings revealed different negative behavioral profiles for each group which may have clinical and practical implications.",

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disease that impacts empathy, emotion, and social behavior. There is emerging evidence that patients with bvFTD have diminished parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system functioning at baseline, deficits that may reflect deterioration of specific neural circuits that support emotion and autonomic nervous system physiology. We measured baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a parasympathetic measure, and skin conductance level (SCL), a sympathetic measure, during a 6-minute resting period in 15 patients with bvFTD and 14 healthy controls who later underwent structural and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess affective symptoms in the patients with bvFTD. Guided by a novel neuroanatomical model, we conducted whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses to identify regions where atrophy was associated with baseline autonomic deficits. We also extracted the functional connectivity time series from 21 emotion network nodes and used hierarchical multiple regression analyses to examine whether functional connectivity deficits in specific node-pairs related to baseline autonomic dysfunction. As expected, patients with bvFTD had significantly lower baseline RSA (p< .05) and SCL (p< .05) than healthy controls. Lower baseline RSA was associated with smaller left ventral anterior insula volume, weaker functional connectivity between bilateral ventral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, and stronger functional connectivity in predominantly right hemisphere hypothalamus-and amygdala-based nodes. Lower baseline SCL, in contrast, was associated with smaller volume in inferior temporal gyrus, dorsal anterior insula, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray; weaker functional connectivity between right hypothalamus/amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex; and stronger functional connectivity between dorsal anterior insula and periaqueductal gray. In bvFTD, higher irritability was correlated with weaker ventral anterior insula -anterior cingulate cortex connectivity whereas higher euphoria was correlated with weaker anterior cingulate cortex -hypothalamus connectivity. Our results suggest that baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic activity depend on the integrity of distinct nodes in a neural network that supports emotion. Resting autonomic physiology is the product of both strong and weak nodal connections, and deterioration of both types of connections is associated with baseline autonomic dysfunction and affective symptoms in bvFTD.",

Seoul, Republic of Korea Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by the early dysfunction in social interaction and communication as well as the presence of repetitive and restrictive behaviors. Despite the high prevalence and the substantial socioeconomic burden of ASD, the exact pathophysiology of ASD has not been clearly defined. Increasing evidence points to a role for microRNAs (miR) as key regulators of gene regulation and neural development. This study aimed to determine miR expression profiles in the brain of ASD mice and to evaluate the effects of the antagomir treatment by inhibiting dysregulated miR. We employed a maternal immune activation model by injecting poly I:C (20 mg/kg) to pregnant mice at E12.5 period. Brain tissue of poly I:C-treated pups and saline-treated controls were obtained at 3 weeks of age. Genome-wide miR expression was analyzed by using Agilent Mouse miRNA 8 X 60K v19. Following the multiple comparison corrections by false discovery rate of 0.05, we identified 29 miR differentially expressed in ASD mice: 8 were upregulated (fold change > 2.0) and 21 were downregulated (fold change < 0.5). The most upregulated miR in ASD mice was miR-877-3p of which the fold change was 101.6. In silico prediction revealed that miR-877-39 targeted the GRIN2B gene encoding the NR2 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Increasing evidence supported that genetic alteration in GRIN2B is associated with ASD. Our observations demonstrated that dysregulated miR expression occurred during the early postnatal period in an ASD mouse model. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect miR-based epigenetic modulation as novel therapeutics for ASD. S161. Bismuth Neurotoxicity: A Rare Cause of Rapidly Progressive Dementia Farwa Ali.

Cognitive screen revealed moderate deficits in attention, recall, visuospatial tasks, and calculation. She was unable to continue her job as a finance analyst. She could no longer drive, cook or hold a coherent conversation. Planning daily activities, organizing tasks and decision making was severely impaired. Urine incontinence occurred episodically. Differential diagnoses included central nervous system infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, para neoplastic and primary neuro-degenerative processes. Patient's EEG showed diffuse intermittent delta range slowing without epileptiform abnormalities. PET scan of the brain revealed generalized moderately diminished FDG uptake by both cerebral hemispheres, in a nonspecific pattern suggestive of encephalopathy. Abdominal X ray done due to a history of collagenous colitis showed punctate radiopaque material scattered throughout the colon. Vitamin B 12 was normal (332 ng/ml), TSH was normal (0.9 mIU/L), normal markers of systemic autoimmunity, spinal fluid analysis showed 4 nucleated cells, protein 21 mg/dL, glucose 60 mg/dL, negative IgG synthesis and oligo clonal bands, protein 14-3-3 was 9.0 ng/ml (<1.5 ng/ml), negative antibodies against NMDA, GABA-R, AMPA-R, GAD-65, CRMP-5, PCA, ANNA, AGNA, voltage gated potassium and calcium channels. Serum levels of cadmium, arsenic, lead, copper and zinc were normal. On further history it was discovered that the patient took bismuth subsalicylate for gastrointestinal symptoms at least 4 tablets of 262 mg each daily over the past two years. Bismuth levels were tested and revealed a whole blood bismuth level in the toxic range at 948 ng/ml (normal <50 ng/mL, toxic > 200 ng/ml), as well as a toxic urine bismuth level >406.5 ng/ml (normal < 50 ng/ml and toxic >200 ng/ml). Bismuth therapy was immediately discontinued. Upon follow up at 12 weeks the patient's cognitive screen was essentially within normal range with only a minimal deficit in calculation, myoclonus and gait ataxia resolved completely. Bismuth blood at this time was 9.5 ng/ml, and bismuth urine 8.6 ng/ml.",

Relevance of Inhibitory Control and Neurocognitive Function to Tactical Self-Regulation in the Context of Driving Nazan Aksan, Sarah Hacker, Marini Robert and Farmer Amanda. Iowa City, IA Epidemiologic data suggest that inexperienced young drivers and older drivers are at increased risk for crashes. Emerging evidence also shows that both at-risk groups evince large individual differences in their ability to self-regulate both tactically (e.g. increasing headway distance) and strategically (e.g. avoiding driving on bad weather days) to conserve safety. Our goal in this study was to quantify tactical selfregulatory processes across the lifespan in a driving simulator study; describe age differences and examine neurocognitive predictors of tactical self-regulation. Drivers who show large differences in fundamental driver skills/performance metrics including maintaining lane position, speed, and headway across varying but typical demand characteristics were argued to be poor at tactical self-regulation as they demonstrate larger lability in performance. We predicted that poor self-regulators would also show poorer performance in neurocognitive tests of functioning, may selfreport lower levels of trait inhibitory control and higher levels of impulsivity especially novelty seeking. A better understanding of these issues can help identify those at-risk drivers who are the most vulnerable road users and shed light on remedial interventions that teach better tactical selfregulatory and compensatory behaviors to conserve safety. To that end, 88 participants from three age groups completed four drives that varied with respect to two within-subject factors: 1) easy vs. difficult drives and 2) presence or absence of a secondary distraction task. We operationalized tactical self-regulation as variability in lane position, headway and speed maintenance across the four drives. Both older drivers and younger drivers showed greater variability in maintaining lane position compared to middle-aged drivers across the four drives (p's <.05). In addition, older drivers showed larger variability in speed maintenance (p's <.01). Findings also showed that cognitive speed of functioning and executive function predicted variability in speed maintenance, memory predicted lane position maintenance while impulsivity but not inhibitory control predicted headway maintenance. These findings encourage an examination of both cognitive function and stable individual differences in specifying risk factors for poor versus better selfregulators.",

All mice were then tested on spatial memory tasks including the Morris Water Maze and an active avoidance task on a rotating arena, as well as a task assessing sociability. Mice were also implanted with recording electrodes and local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 regions bilaterally. Compared to controls, mice with TSC1 gene knockout showed cognitive deficits, having poorer performance in the Morris Water Maze task and receiving more total shocks per day during the active avoidance task. Electrophysiology recordings showed a slight but significant increase in the normalized power of theta range oscillations in the hippocampi of TSC1 gene knockouts. None of the mice had seizures. Our results suggest that a localized knockout of the TSC1 gene in the hippocampi is sufficient to generate cognitive dysfunction and changes in oscillatory patterns, but a broader network effect may be required to generate seizures seen in the disorder.",

Jacobs et al first coined the term in 1971 and since then there have been 25 cases in total reported in the literature. Palinacousis tends to occur in the ictal or peri-ictal period but has been well described during the brain mapping procedures of Penfield and Perot in the 1960's. Although the etiologies causing this phenomenon vary along the auditory pathway from strokes in the medial geniculate body to tumors in the temporal lobe the echoing of sounds or fragments of sentences recently emitted in the environment is the consequence. Often because of its location palinacousis at times occurs while the patient is aphasic making the diagnosis more difficult but we believe that it occurs much more often then reported. In the table below we describe 6 new cases of palinacousis.",

Generalized Tonic Clonic and Psychogenic Non Epileptic Spells Audio Recordings in the Epilepsy Monitoring Units: Identification and Inter-Rater Agreement Richa Tripathi, Hardik Doshi, Deepti Zutshi, Aashit Shah and Maysaa Basha. Detroit, MI Introduction: Generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCs) are associated with generalized convulsive movements. It is associated with vocalization, motor movements that consist of asymmetric clonic jerking, a diffuse tonic phase, and followed by clonic phase. GTCs can be easily identified and diagnosed by video EEG monitoring. Patients with frequent GTCs have an associated increased risk for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), respiratory distress, and physical injuries. Concern over such events has prompted caregivers to look for detection aids which include bed alarms and EMG-based devices. Detection devices based on sound have not been explored yet which can differentiate GTCs from Psychogenic Non Epileptic Events (PNES).",

Further analysis to identify specific features that aid in the identification is needed and has a potential for creation of at-home or in-hospital audio recognition. Epilepsy has been associated with changes in the connectivity of human brain functional networks, such as the default mode network (1). It is unclear whether these changes reflect a chronic effect of the disease or whether they are an index of acute seizure burden, reflecting active disruption of functional networks (2,3). Epilepsy surgery is a therapeutic option for patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that can drastically reduce seizures or lead to seizure-freedom. To assess whether a significant reduction in seizure burden affects the abnormal connections of functional networks of epilepsy patients, we studied the preoperative and postoperative resting-state brain connectivity of 17 patients with intractable TLE before and after they underwent epilepsy surgery with Engel Class I outcome (i.e. seizure-free after surgery), as well as 17 age, gender and handedness-matched controls. We specifically focused on 264 nodes forming 12 distinct resting state subnetworks characterized in a large healthy control set. Participants were scanned in a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner with a resting state fMRI protocol. In patients the postoperative scan occurred a minimum of 8 months after surgery (mean 37 months, range 8-51 months). Strict artifact removal criteria according to recently published methods (4) were applied to the imaging data. Replicating prior studies (1), preoperative TLE patients showed significant differences in connectivity from healthy controls, primarily involving the default mode network and the temporal/auditory subnetworks (F 5 12.2, p.<001). Importantly, however, connectivity was largely unaffected by achieving seizure freedom, with abnormal connections remaining essentially unchanged postoperatively. This surprising result suggests that the abnormal network connectivity seen in intractable TLE reflects a history of abnormal connections, i.e. a chronic effect of the disease, rather than an acute index of seizure burden such as would be predicted by active disruption of brain networks by ongoing epileptic seizures.

Phosphorylation on serine-129 of aSyn is found almost exclusively, and in high abundance, in pathological aSyn aggregates. The functional role of phosphorylation at this site is controversial, as there are conflicting data regarding its role in aSyn-induced cell death. Mutations in aSyn account for rare cases of autosomal dominant PD. These mutations have been of limited value in understanding how aSyn can cause neurological disease because they have variable effects on putative pathogenic mechanisms. An alternative approach is to study rationally designed mutants of aSyn in order to understand the effect of alterations in defined regions or functions of the protein. aSyn contains highly conserved repeat motifs (KTKEGV) throughout the protein. Engineered mutations in these repeats lead to disruption of several aSyn functions, such as lipid binding and formation of aSyn multimers. In some cases, the effects of these KTKEGV-mutant proteins represent an enhanced or exaggerated version of changes caused by PD-linked mutations in aSyn. Therefore, these designed mutations may shed light on the pathogenic events caused by aSyn dysfunction. We find that KTKEGV-mutants lead to rapid death of primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, KTKEGVmutants impair neurite regrowth after mechanical injury in cultured neurons. Strikingly, each mutant is strongly phosphorylated on serine-129. In conclusion, KTKEGV-mutants may help to elucidate key pathophysiologic mechanisms, such as the role of phosphorylation on serine-129, involved in aSyn-mediated neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

As a demyelinating disease, there is significant damage to oligodendrocytes within the thoracic and cervical spinal cord although there has been a paucity of evidence for active infection of resident neural cells. There is much debate in the field concerning the cause of this damage, whether due to a bystander effect from elevated cytokines or through direct targeting of oligodendrocytes as HAM/TSP patients are noted for an increased presence of HTLV-1 specific T cells in the CNS. Exosomes, secreted microvesicles ranging from 30 to 100nm, have been shown to serve as a source of antigen in the immune system previously and accumulating evidence is pointing to the ability of viruses to hijack this system of intercellular communication. Due to prior evidence of HTLV-1 components present in extracellular vesicles isolated from HTLV-1 infected cell lines, we sought to discover if this phenomenon was recapitulated in vivo. We tested HAM/TSP CSF and HTLV-1 seronegative Multiple Sclerosis CSF and found the presence of HTLV-1 Tax in exosomes isolated by a novel nanotrap technology from HAM/ TSP CSF. Importantly, we could also find Tax in exosomes isolated from ex vivo culture of some HAM/TSP patient PBMCs that were positive for Tax in the exosomes from their CSF, although the relationship did not hold for all patients. Furthermore, in both normal donors (NDs) activated CD41CD251 and CD81CD251 T cells were the primary sources of these exosomes, but highest increase in eoxsome secretion occurred after activation of the CD41CD251 T cell subset. As, this subset serves as a viral reservoir in HAM/TSP and is noted for dysfunctional suppressive capabilities in HAM/TSP, we propose that they are a source of the Tax1 exosomes found in our patients and have undertaken experiments to validate this hypothesis.",

S182. Repurposing of Prostate Cancer Chemotherapeutics as a Brain Bioavailable Nurr1 Transactivator for Treatment of Synucleinopathies in Parkinson's Disease Giulio Pasinetti and Kenjiro Ono. New York and Tokyo, Japan IRX4204 is a second generation retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist currently being tested for prostate cancer treatment with an excellent safety record. Nurr1-RXR heterodimer selective agonists have been actively pursued as a potential pharmacological target for Parkinson's disease (PD) due to their neuroprotective effects in models of PD. The objective of our study is to evaluate the effects of IRX4204 as a potential novel therapeutic in PD neuropathology. Primary rat mesencephalic cultures were used study the role of IRX4204 on Nurr1-mediated neuroprotection. The 6hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) induced rat model of PD was used to examine the potential neuroprotective role IRX4204 on PD pathology. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified protein (PICUP) were used to evaluate the role IRX4204 on prevention of asynuclein binding and oligomerization. We found IRX4204 can selectively promote dimerization of the nuclear factor Nurr1-RXR at nM concentration in vitro and can promote expression of neurotrophic factors for the survival and maintenance of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons in a dosedependent manner in vivo. This evidence is consistent with a significant attenuation of PD-type motor impairments following 6-OHDA lesions in response to IRX4204. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and PICUP assays, we found that IRX4204 shifts and prevents oligomerization of a-synuclein. Our data suggest that IRX4204 may benefit PD by providing neuroprotective support for DA neurons and by protecting DA neurons from a-synuclein neurotoxicity. We hypothesize that IRX4204 may neuroprotect DA neurons through Nurr1 mediated neuroprotective mechanisms intracellularly and possibly at more advanced PD-like states through inhibition of a-synuclein oligomerization. ).

            "text": "Purpose: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffering from levodopa motor complications such as dyskinesia and motor fluctuations. It has been the prevailing notion that high frequency (130-180Hz) stimulation (HFS) is the driving force of clinical benefit, but recent studies have suggested the possible role of 60Hz stimulation for patients with gait disorder. Coupling these findings with growing physiological understanding of aberrant neuronal oscillations in the PD state underscores the idea that frequency -modulation may differentially influence various motor networks and symptoms. Therefore, the development of a computational model which stratifies patients a priori based on symptomatology into different frequency settings stands to improve the speed and efficiency by which programming optimization can be achieved. Here, we build a computational model that can accurately predict the patient-specific optimal frequency level after surgery (i.e., 60Hz or high frequency stimulation).",

Background: Tumor treating electric fields (TTFields) therapy is an established treatment approved for patients with glioblastoma. It is frequency tuned to 200 kHz to disrupt cytokinesis of tumor cells during their transition from metaphase to anaphase. Two orthogonal arrays of TTFields transducers are applied to the shaved scalp of patients, but the contribution of anatomical and physical characteristics of the brain parenchyma and the tumor to treatment efficacy is poorly understood. Methods: Three dimensional gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured using ScanIP software (Simpleware Ltd) and bi-dimensional tumor size was measured according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria on 5 patients with recurrent glioblastomas who benefited from TTFields (cohort 1) and 5 who did not (cohort 2).

The current study used a form of TMS, called theta burst stimulation (TBS), to investigate the clinical utility of TBS for improving word retrieval in picture naming. Eight patients with aphasia due to left-hemisphere stroke received inhibitory TBS to right pars triangularis (rPTr) vs. a control site (i.e., vertex) in separate sessions. Prior to stimulation, we obtained a baseline assessment of naming ability using a picture corpus of 520 common objects. We then compared naming accuracy prior to and immediately following stimulation of each site. We found that individuals varied in their responsiveness to TBS. We investigated whether naming impairment severity at baseline related to this variability by assigning subjects to groups based on a median split of baseline naming accuracy (median 5 48%). We then explored within each group whether naming accuracy improved following TBS of rPTr vs. vertex. We found that patients with less severe naming impairments (i.e., > 48% accuracy at baseline; n 5 4) were more accurate following rPTr stimulation when compared to pre-stimulation performance (p 5 .002), whereas this was not the case following vertex stimulation (p 5 .52). Language gains following rPTr stimulation were significantly greater than changes in performance following vertex stimulation (p 5 .05). Conversely, patients with more severe naming impairments performed worse following rPTr stimulation compared to pre-stimulation performance (p 5 .025), whereas accuracy did not change pre-vs. post-stimulation of the vertex (p 5 .41). However, the decrease in naming accuracy following rPTr stimulation for the more impaired speakers did not significantly differ from changes in naming accuracy that occurred following vertex stimulation (p 5 .15). We conclude that patients vary in their responsiveness to TMS, and the degree to which word retrieval is impaired may predict which patients are more likely to benefit from inhibitory TMS of the rPTr. These findings have implications for predicting individual differences in responsiveness to TMS. Cerebrovascular Disease S195. White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns Associated with Atrial Fibrillation in Embolic Ischemic Strokes Yunis Mayasi, Johanna Helenius and Nils Henninger. Worcester, MA Background and Purpose: Among patients with a cardioembolic stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common comorbidity that is associated with a worse outcome. Mounting data indicates that AF may relate to stroke pathogenesis through mechanisms other than cerebral thromboembolic complications. This view is supported by observations that AF patients have an increased risk for cerebral small vessel disease related lesions such as greater white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesion burden. Subcortical WMH spots as well as larger patches are commonly observed in clinical and research MRI but the significance of these different patterns is not known. We sought to identify different WMH patterns between patients with AF vs. non-AF related embolic ischemic strokes.",

Despite availability of IV tPA and mechanical thrombectomy, over half of treated patients have significant disability. Cell based therapy is a promising in pre-clinical studies in improving stroke recovery. Final brain infarct volume is a major predictor of stroke outcome and may decrease with this treatment.

Baseline characteristics, imaging for procedure selection, patients receiving intravenous tPA, onset to groin puncture, and onset to recanalization times were comparable in both groups. Patients in the SR group had a higher number of passes, distal embolization, a longer procedure time, and were more likely to have more than one vessel occlusion at the onset of procedure; patients in the PA group were more likely to have a vessel vasospasm. Recanalization rates in the PA group were significantly higher, however when primary aspiration failed stent retrievers were used in combination. A total of 67 patients (36%) had a favourable clinical outcome, with no significant difference between the SR and PA group; fourteen patients were loss to follow up.

Baltimore, MD and Winston Salem, NC Background: Ketogenic diets (KDs) have been used as an effective therapy for epilepsy since 1921. More recently they have been studied in a variety of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and cancer. One potential mechanism of action is decreasing inflammation, in part by lessening NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Youm). Previous studies have shown that KDs modulate immune cell function (Youm, McMurray) and may decrease overall lymphocyte count (Fraser). Small human trials lasting 2-12 weeks have shown no adverse effect on white blood cell counts (Schmidt, Rafal). However, the data are inconclusive due to small sample size and short diet duration. The potential immune modulation raises concerns over risk of infection in immunosuppressed patients. Specifically, cancer patients with already low blood counts risk not receiving required chemotherapy if their white blood count (WBC) is insufficient. In this study we explore change in WBC over time in patients on KDs.",

Confounds often preclude the standardization and generalization of intracarotid amobarbital procedures (IAP) to nonnative English-speaking surgical candidates. Beyond immutable differences, such as the risk of atypical language representation, medical interpreters may extend the duration of the test which could artificially inflate memory scores. Sixtytwo Spanish-and 62 English-speaking surgical candidates were matched by age, education, and gender. All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. All procedures were conducted in the patient's primary language, with an interpreter, if needed. No significant between-group differences emerged for age, education, gender and handedness (p > 0.05). The time of procedure ranged from 87-440 sec, with a mean of 195.17 sec (SD 5 74.30 seconds). Although the duration of the procedure at first injection did not significantly differ between English-and Spanish-speaking groups, the length of presentation was significantly longer in Spanish speakers during the second injection (p 5 0.044). Memory scores did not differ between language groups. The use of interpreters during the IAP introduce potential variability to the additional response delay, resulting in longer procedure durations.

We study the medial frontal cortex of patients with Parkinson's disease and animal models using a combination of EEG, single neuronal recordings, and brain stimulation techniques. We report three main findings. First, patients with Parkinson's disease have attenuated $4 Hz rhythms in mid-frontal cortex during cognitive tasks. Second, this $4 Hz rhythm synchronizes single neurons involved in cognitive processing in the human subthalamic nucleus and throughout frontal, cerebellar, and striatal brain areas in rodents. Third, optogenetically stimulating frontal neurons expressing dopamine receptors at 4 Hz in animal models can compensate for dopaminedependent cognitive deficits. These data indicate that 4 Hz activity is a key mechanism of cognitive control that malfunctions in Parkinson's disease, and could provide new insight into cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

Longitudinal studies utilizing the PSP-QoL are needed to further assess its utility in PSP. Background: Recently, energy supply to axons via glial cells has received a lot of attention. Nutritional substances are transferred from blood vessel to axons via connexins (Cxs) gap junction channels or glucose transporters (GLUTs) and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). We previously reported extensive loss of Cxs in active lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and Bal o's disease (BD), suggesting early disruption of Cxs may cause extensive energy failure and contribute to the pathogenesis in demyelinating disorders. To obtain more precise understanding of metabolic conditions in demyelinating disorders, we studied the expression of GLUTs and MCTs in MS and NMO.",

In the active demyelinating lesion of MS, despite of massive perivascular lymphocytic cuffing, endothelial MCT1 and GLUT1 were relatively preserved. By contrast, immunoreactivity for MCT4 was diminished in the perivascular foot processes in active lesion. Microglial GLUT5 was up-regulated in activated microglia and foamy macrophages in active lesion. GLUT3, MCT2 and MCT4 were preserved in cortical gray matter lesions of MS.

Prior research has indicated that increased accessibility by medical doctors of psychiatric electronic medical records is associated with improved clinical care for psychiatric patients (Kozubal et al., 2013) . Despite this finding, many hospitals and healthcare providers are reluctant to share psychiatric information among physicians due to the perception of patients' elevated concerns about the privacy of their psychiatric information. The purpose of the present study is to clarify neurological patients' attitudes toward sharing medical and psychiatric information electronically among their clinicians, their feelings of stigma surrounding both medical and psychiatric illnesses, and their knowledge of the electronic medical record system. This study recruited via email members of MSAA (Multiple Sclerosis Association of America) who have a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis with or without an additional co-occurring medical or psychiatric disorder (N 5 3614), and participants completed an online survey. Preliminary results indicated that most patients are willing to share both psychiatric (90 percent) and medical information (97 percent) with other doctors, and having a psychiatric illness predicted a higher willingness to share psychiatric records, (p < .05). Although 97 percent of participants believed that there were benefits to sharing medical records electronically, 77 percent of participants were not completely sure how the electronic medical records system works, and 82 percent of participants did not completely understand who can access their medical records. Ninetyseven percent of people surveyed also believed that they should have some say in whether their records, both medical and psychiatric, are shared with other doctors. These results suggest that, although most neurological patients are willing to have their information shared in the electronic medical record system, there is a lack of understanding about the electronic medical record system, and more patient education is necessary. Cognitive impairment occurs in approximately 47% of patients with primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS) 1 and it appears related to the disruption of brain functional connectivity (FC) as measured by resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor abnormalities. 2 While the relationship between cognitive-related FC abnormalities and the damage of the connecting white matter (WM) tracts is well established in relapsing-remitting MS, 3 it is not clear whether this holds true in PP-MS patients who are characterized by a relatively moderate WM lesion burden 4 and a high burden of cortical lesions (CLs). 5 Recent advances in rs-fMRI analysis have suggested that the measurement of FC in multiple frequency bands and the measurement of variability of BOLD signal amplitude provide a more comprehensive characterization of brain functional complexity. 6, 7 We sought to determine FC and neuronal variability, as measured by standard deviation (SD) of BOLD signal amplitude, across multiple frequency bands in brain networks that underlie cognitive deficits in PP-MS and to investigate the impact of brain CLs on FC and SD abnormalities. FC and SD of resting state networks (RSNs) associated with cognitive deficits in different frequency bands (Standard, were investigated in 25 PP-MS patients. The RSNs were compared voxel-wise amongst cognitively impaired and preserved patients and healthy controls. CL number was assessed on phase-sensitive inversion recovery images. We confirmed the presence of a widespread cognitive deterioration in PP-MS patients, with main involvement of visuo-spatial and executive domains. The presence of intracortical (IC) lesions was a relevant correlate of cognitive impairment in addition to diffuse WM injury. The functional analysis of the dorsal attention and executive networks (DAN and ECN) confirmed the presence of cortical reorganization presenting as increased variability and inter-network connectivity between ECN, DAN and other large-scale networks responsible for cognitive control. FC anomalies along the midline and deep gray matter regions were mainly observed in the lowest frequency band. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a maladaptive hypersynchronization of large scale networks and an abnormal pattern of neural activity underlie cognitive dysfunction in PP-MS. The higher CL count in patients with cognitive impairment suggests they may contribute to FC and SD abnormalities.",

Background: Withdrawing life-sustaining therapy (WLST) because of perceived poor neurological prognosis is a common cause of hospital death after both in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Recent guidelines recommend against WLST before 72 hours (WLST < 72 h).

Seoul, Korea and Winston Salem, NC Several studies, but not all, have shown that women benefit more from thrombolysis (tPA) than men; none have accounted for pre-stroke mobility. Our aim was to determine whether there was an interaction between gender and thrombolysis treatment in 3 month modified Rankin score (mRS), after adjusting for pre-stroke mobility. Our design was a retrospective medical record review of consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center 10/2012 to 7/2015. We included 952 (469 women and 483 men) patients. Women were older (mean age 68 y vs men 65.8 y; p50.018), less likely to be treated with IV tPA (15.8% vs 23.4% in men; p50.003), and more likely to use walking aids pre-stroke (13.6% vs 8.3% in men; p50.008). Women had worse outcomes (55.9% with mRS > 3) than men (40.5%; p<0.001) in those with no tPA. In those who received tPA, there were no gender differences. In multivariable modeling, there was a significant interaction such that women responded with better outcome and men had worse outcome after tPA (p<0.001), even after adjustment for pre-stroke walking aids (p<0.001), age (p50.001), NIHSS (p<0.001), diabetes (p50.001), CHF (p50.049), and prior stroke (p<0.001). Our results show that, unfortunately, women were less likely to be treated with IV tPA than men, but when treated, women received more benefit than men, even in the setting of prestroke mobility impairment.

B12 deficiency may be more common in Parkinson's disease (PD) because of associated gastrointestinal changes. It is unknown whether B12 supplementation might reduce overall morbidity.

Interestingly, MB was originally included in the primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) class together with pineoblastoma. An approach that could accurately distinguish the MB tumors and pineoblastoma based on their molecular composition would bring additional information on these tumor types.

Baltimore and Baltimore, MD Defects in AARS2, encoding mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase, result in a spectrum of findings, ranging from infantile cardiomyopathy to progressive leukoencephalopathy. To date, there are 8 such reported cases. In this report, we present a 50-year-old man with progressive cognitive and motor decline, beginning in his fifth decade of life, as well as evidence of a leukodystrophy on brain MRI, found to have compound heterozygous AARS2 mutations. The patient presented for evaluation in Neurogenetics clinic at the age of 48 years. His childhood and early adulthood course were significant for two seizures (one between 2-4 years of age and another between 14-16 years of age), fine tremor which developed around 25 years of age, and anxiety attacks starting in his early 30s. His neurological deterioration commenced when he was 42 years old, when he developed fine motor difficulties, worsening tremor, depression, and unsteady balance. Thereafter, he progressively declined in cognitive and motor abilities. By around 46 years of age, he had lost all speech, became immobile, and developed dysphagia. MRI at age 47 years showed bilateral, symmetric white matter changes in the frontal regions, occipital regions, and brain stem, as well as cortical and cerebellar atrophy; these findings were progressive compared to MRI at 42 years, which revealed prominent frontal white matter changes. After extensive prior genetic and metabolic testing, he underwent whole exome sequencing, which revealed compound heterozygous changes in AARS2: c.595C>T (p.R199C); c.2557C>T (p.R853W). The p.R199C variant has been previously reported in association with leukoencephalopathy and is predicted to impact synthetase function based on published structural modeling analysis. The p.R853W variant occurs at a position that is evolutionarily conserved, and in silico pathogenicity tools predict that this variant is probably damaging. Our case expands the clinical heterogeneity of AARS2 related disorders, as he is the oldest known survivor of this disease. Case: A 60-year-old right-handed woman presented with difficulty expressing herself and trouble following multistep directions. She had significant word finding difficulty in conversational speech and marked involvement of her written language output, so much so that she was unable to convey a message in writing that she could easily convey in speech. Approximately a year into the illness she developed mild difficulty with object use, but did not have personality changes, memory complaints, hallucinations or visuospatial difficulties. Her family history was significant for Parkinson's disease in her mother and a sister passed away with a diagnosis of Pick's disease although an autopsy was not performed. Seven other siblings were cognitively normal. Initial neurologic examination revealed difficulty with calculation and digit span, but no trouble with naming, recall, registration or construction. Her repetition was spared, but she had difficulty following three step commands and her writing was significantly impaired. Picture description resulted in significant word finding pauses and semantic paraphasic errors. Formal neuropsychometric testing 18 months after symptom onset revealed impaired performance on attentional tasks, trail making, lexical and semantic fluency and logical memory, with relatively preserved audioverbal learning and recall, naming and construction. Her neurologic examination two years into the illness showed more generalized cognitive and language impairment, as well as ideomotor apraxia and hemiparkinsonism. Her initial MR imaging showed moderate to severe asymmetric left frontal-temporalparietal atrophy. FDG-PET imaging showed a similar, almost exclusively left sided pattern of intense hypometabolism. Amyloid PET imaging was negative. At follow up 16 months later both the left sided focal atrophy and hypometabolism had progressed, with little to no progression in the right hemisphere. Genetic testing revealed a previously unreported mutation in exon 12 of the GRN gene (c.1535delC, Pro512LeufsX5), resulting in a premature stop codon. Further evidence for pathogenicity was sought with quantification of serum progranulin levels.",

Adams and Foley in hepatic coma patients found that protoplasmic astrocytes increased diffusely in number and size with swelling of terminal processes, and folding of the basement membrane surrounding the capillaries, which affected the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex and the subcortical structures. Acutely, neurons were not affected; however, chronically, neuronal loss was seen. Therefore, the degree of cerebral vascular dysfunction of the structures could be correlated with the density of protoplasmic astrocytes in the particular grey matter structure. Therefore, successive involvement of grey matter structures could likely be due to increased destruction of the protoplasmic astrocytic function. We hypothesize that the progressive involvement of these grey matter structures could represent an analogous vascular shunt phenomenon similar to the portosystemic shunt of the abdominal vasculature, being regulated by protoplasmic astrocytic dysfunction.",

Background AND Purpose: In acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusions (LVO), endovascular reperfusion within 6 hours from symptom onset improves long-term clinical outcomes. The Mount Sinai endovascular team receives transfers from community emergency departments (ED) at outside hospitals (OSH) within our health system and its affiliates. The optimal timing of diagnostic CT angiograms (CTA) is uncertain. Holding ambulance crews at the OSH while waiting to obtain CTA before departure can result in transfer delays. Conversely, obtaining CTA after arrival may result in unnecessarily transferring non-LVO patients. We sought to examine transfer practices and evaluate for differences in reperfusion times in relation to timing of CTA. We hypothesized: 1) reperfusion times would be similar 2) transferring patients without CTA results in the unnecessary transfer of non-LVO cases.",

Weighted analysis to account for survey sampling was performed for categorical data with significance test by chi-square, for continuous data analysis using Student's t-test, and Cochran-Armitage test for trend. The primary comparison was mortality by time of week of admission (weekday versus weekend). Multivariate survey logistic regression was performed with primary outcome of mortality and the secondary outcome of discharge disposition (DD: discharge to skilled nursing facility/Intermediate care facility), comparing time of week of admission, adjusting for age, gender, race, hospital region, hospital academic status, and primary payer.

Subjects undergoing intracranial EEG were tested using an object-in-place scene memory test, a task where the subject was required to recognize sets of correct targets on a colored Background. Their performance on this task was compared to the oscillatory activity in their brain. Spectral features associated with task parameters include theta/alpha band error signaling, high frequency spikes, attenuation of alpha and beta rhythm peri-selection, and late increase in alpha activity. Coherence between brain regions suggests a functional network supported by theta/alpha band coherence between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobe.

First, neurologists should consider this deletion in a patient with YOPD and 22q11 syndrome features including learning disability, facial dysmorphism, congenital cardiac malformations, hypocalcemia, and velopharyngeal insufficiency. Second, patients with the 22q11 deletion should be monitored for parkinsonism. Third, patients with 22q11 are often treated with antipsychotics and may be falsely assumed to have drug-induced parkinsonism rather than PD. Fourth, the 22q11 deletion may offer insights into the pathophysiology of PD. Lastly, the unexpected association between 22q11 deletion and YOPD demonstrates that potentially important insights may be gained by considering that seemingly unrelated clinical findings or other diseases in patients with PD may not be simply coincidental.",

Sakai, Osaka, Japan and Osaka Sayama, Osaka, Japan Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease, characterized by a late-onset, slowly progressive disorder that mainly affects the cerebellum. Dysphagia is a common symptom in most neurodegenerative diseases and leads to aspiration pneumonia or suffocation, major causes of death in such patients. Characteristics of dysphagia in patients with SCA6 have been rarely reported. The aim of this study was to clarify progression patterns of dysphagia in patients with SCA 6 (N512) and to compare them with those with SCA3 (N56) using repetitive videofluoroscopic examination (VF). We revealed that the gross progression of dysphagia was apparently slower in patients with SCA6 than in those with SCA3. However four patients with SCA6 had earlier onsets of dysphagia (within 10 years from ataxia onset), with more rapid progressions than the rest of patients. A common clinical feature of the four patients was unexpectedly an older age at onset (> 60 y), though normally later onsets and milder phenotypes are linked in patients with shorter polyglutamine repeats. Nonetheless, in our study polyglutamine repeats did not parallel the dysphagia severities. One of the four patients had significant ischemic changes in the cerebral white matter and brainstem on MRI. Despite the small number of the patients enrolled, our findings suggests that clinicians should carefully monitor dysphagia in patients with SCA6 with older age at onset, since age-related factors might worsen dysphagia in such patients.",

Examination at 10 years revealed inability to walk, truncal hypotonia, lower limb spasticity, hyperreflexia, weakness, and generalized dystonia with marked involvement of the left arm and leg. Speech articulation became increasingly impaired. Trihexylphenidyl and clonazepam provided limited symptomatic benefit. Brain MRI at 12 years demonstrated symmetric abnormal pallidal susceptibility, consistent with iron deposition.

Clinical studies suggest that this drug is neuroprotective; however, the cellular mechanisms underlying neuroprotection are not well understood. We adapted a human neuronal progenitor cell population (hNP1), derived from hESC WA09, to study how fingolimod affects neurons exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). hNP1 cells were differentiated in medium alone (untreated), or in medium with added supernatants from mock-infected or HIV-infected lymphocytes, with or without daily added phosphorylated fingolimod. After 9 days and 12 days in culture, cells were lysed, and gene expression was measured using the Illumina HT12 microarray platform. Differences in gene expression were evaluated according to both culture supernatant treatment and fingolimod treatment. The significance of these differences was assessed by ANOVA and Students t-test. By ANOVA, 189 genes were differentially regulated among untreated, mock-, and HIV-supernatant exposed cultures without added fingolimod, and 248 with added fingolimod after 9 days in culture (FDR adjusted value less than 0.25, p value less than 0.05). A larger number of genes were differentially expressed after 12 days in culture; 231 genes without fingolimod and 853 with fingolimod. Paired comparisons of untreated, mock-treated, and HIV-treated cultures with or without fingolimod revealed diverse genes showing statistically significant differences in expression with fingolimod treatment (absolute fold change value of 2.5 or more; p value less than 0.05). Differentially expressed genes reflected cell processes including neurogenesis, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, RNA processing, and cell growth control. The effects of fingolimod could vary according to whether the differentiating neurons were exposed to mock or viral-containing supernatants. For example, in untreated cultures, expression of IL10 is unchanged by fingolimod exposure. In hNP1 cells differentiated with mock-infected supernatants, expression of IL10 is five fold higher with fingolimod exposure. In contrast, in hNP1 cells differentiated with HIV-infected supernatant, IL10 expression is reduced more than two fold with fingolimod exposure. Gene expression for the RNA helicase DDX3X was significantly upregulated in hNP1 cells differentiated with HIV-infected supernatant and fingolimod exposure. DDX3X has been implicated in anti-viral innate immune responses. These initial studies suggest that fingolimod can enhance neuronal anti-inflammatory or innate immune responses. Further studies on individual neuronal genes will help define the neuroprotective mechanisms this drug may promote.",

This suggests that the origin for this phenomenon is a dysfunction in the olfactory system with misperception of loss of retronasal smell as loss of taste. The mechanism for this phenomenon may be pathological olfactory system with hyper-rapid adaptation (rapid shift on the exponential curve, Overbosch et al 1986). As such, one may anticipate that olfactory ability would not be totally absent, but rather severely reduced. Only half demonstrated the parallel phenomenon of hyper-rapid adaptation in orthonasal smell, as manifested by olfactory windows. Given the findings of gustatory deficit in 5 of 6 of these patients, true pathology of the gustatory system may be present and thus this may represent pathological hyper-acceleration of gustatory adaptation (Gent & McBur-ney1978) or synergistic or additive hyper-acceleration of both olfactory and gustatory systems. Alternatively, first taste syndrome might represent an expectation with an associated projection with transient illusion of taste, the perceived flavor based on visual cues (\"The first taste is always with the eyes\", Van der Laan 2011). Such a transient hallucinatory phenomenon is seen in those suffering from cortical blindness as well as with haptic hallucinations with spinal cord injury and proprioceptive/kinesthetic hallucinations post amputation.

Philadelphia, PA and Elkins Park, PA Chronic stroke-induced aphasia affects approximately one million individuals in the US alone. It is widely assumed that most language improvements in persons with aphasia (PWA) occur spontaneously within three months post-stroke onset (MPO). This view of chronic aphasia as static directly impacts the availability of therapy and other supports for patients with persistent language deficits. Recently, however, we discovered that some chronic PWA made substantial recovery between 5 months to 8 years post-onset that cannot be ascribed to speech-language therapy (SLT). We examined the impact of demographic, psychosocial, and/or neurobiological factors on long-term aphasia recovery. We tested 18 chronic PWA secondary to left hemisphere stroke twice on the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB). We used WAB Aphasia Quotient (AQ) to assess changes in language impairment. Initial WAB assessments were performed from 5-133 MPO (mean: 40 months), and follow-up tests from 21-94 months after initial testing (mean: 61 months). We assessed psychosocial factors mediating aphasia recovery using a pictographic questionnaire rating the self-perceived burden of aphasia pertaining to quality of life and life participation. Lastly, we investigated the impact of lesion volume on aphasia recovery. Using a conservative benchmark of a > 7 point increase, 12 patients showed a clinically significant change in AQ. This \"change\" group did not differ from the \"stable\" group (n 5 6) in mean age, education, and initial aphasia severity (p's > .2). The \"change\" group reported marginally higher life participation satisfaction (p < .065) and more frequent technology use (p 5 .02) than those in the \"stable\" group. Correlational analyses across all patients revealed a significant relationship between AQ percent change across the two time points, and lesion volume and MPO at initial testing (p's < .05). Additional analyses exploring whether these two factors independently contributed to changes in AQ scores revealed that lesion volume better predicts aphasia recovery; smaller lesions correlate with better recovery outcomes. This study demonstrates that PWA can recover long into the chronic period, and lesion volume appears to be a strong predictor of this potential. These findings highlight need for (1) acute stroke care centering on tissue preservation, whether through pharmacologic or procedural interventions minimizing ischemic burden or increased community awareness and education enabling early detection of and response to stroke symptoms; and (2) increased availability of resources such as SLT, aphasia centers, and assistive technologies to enhance long-term participation for PWA.",

Baltimore, MD Background: Perinatal hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) brain injury and stroke are significant causes of neurologic disability throughout the lifespan. Abundant data suggests a crucial period of enhanced plasticity following such injuries that may represent an important therapeutic target for improving brain recovery and regeneration. The cellular and molecular mechanisms triggering this period of plasticity remain unclear. We hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms, specifically DNA methylation, may be important regulators in this process. DNA methylation has long been considered a very stable epigenetic of gene expression, but recent evidence points to a more dynamic nature of this epigenetic mark. DNA is typically methylated at specific sites, most commonly cytosine-guanidine dinucleotides (CpGs). The proposed mechanism by which these CpGs become demethylated involves hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) mediated by teneleven-translocase enzymes (Tet), followed by excision and replacement with unmethylated cytosine through base excision and repair mechanisms and the Gadd45 family of proteins.",

This work sponsored by NIH-NINDS R-01 NS 30678. The coordination of dynamic neural activity within and between neural networks is believed to underlie normal cognitive processes. Conversely, cognitive deficits that occur following neurological insults may result from network discoordination. We hypothesized that cognitive outcome following febrile status epilepticus (FSE) depends on network efficacy within and between layers CA1 and CA3 to dynamically organize cell activity by theta phase. Control and FSE rats were trained to forage or perform an active avoidance spatial task. FSE rats were sorted by those that were able to reach task criterion (FSE-L) and those that could not (FSE-NL). FSE-NL CA1 place cells did not exhibit phase preference in either context and exhibited poor cross-theta interaction between CA1 and CA3. FSE-L and control CA1 place cells exhibited phase preference at peak theta that shifted during active avoidance to the same static phase preference observed in CA3. Temporal coordination of neuronal activity by theta phase may therefore explain variability in cognitive outcome following neurological insults in early development.",

Hippocampus and cortex, the two main structures of the brain involved in the process of epileptogenesis, were used for microarray analysis (Arraystar Mouse LncRNA Expression Microarray V3.0). A total of 35,923 LncRNAs were analyzed. As a result, 22 and 83 LncRNAs were up-and down-regulated (!2.0-fold, P< 0.05) in the hippocampus of the epilepsy models, while 46 and 659 LncRNAs were up-and down-regulated in the cortex of the epilepsy models. Among these, 5 IncRNAs were up-regulated and 14 were down-regulated in both hippocampus and cortex of the epilepsy models. This is the first study to identify dysregulated LncRNAs in the hippocampus and cortex of the pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy model. We believe that this finding will serve as a stepping stone in the emerging LncRNA research field. The extant literature describing germline mutations of the Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway known as RASopathies has expanded, including greater understanding of its role in childhood cancers. However, given their relative rarity, comparatively less is known about the cognitive, behavioral and social sequelae of children with co-occurring disorders. This case study describes the cognitive, behavioral and social functioning of a four year old child diagnosed with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS), including craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital heart disease, dermatologic abnormalities, delayed acquisition of motor skills and slowed growth. Additional history included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed at 15 months of age treated with both chemotherapy and intrathecal radiation. Delayed motor development, profound distractibility and difficulty with peer relationships were also described. An extensive psychoeducational and neuropsychological test battery was administered to document the patient's unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses in order to inform diagnosis and treatment planning. Test results indicated that the child's current intellectual functioning was highly variable secondary to attentional deficits and poor fine-motor control. Despite these limitations, superior scores were received on measures of language, fluid reasoning, learning and memory. A screening of early academic functioning indicated that emergent reading and mathematics skills were also quite advanced for the patient's chronological age. Weaknesses included reduced processing speed, poor sustained attention and concentration, and diminished fine motor dexterity bilaterally. However, the patient did not present with the intellectual capacity disabilities often seen in individuals with CFCS. In terms of etiology, data were difficult to interpret, as prolonged response latency, diminished attention/concentration and reduced interest in peer relationships have been well documented in both individuals with CFCS, as well as in children receiving treatment for ALL. Given the elevated risk of childhood cancer, baseline and serial neuropsychological testing is vital to the clinical management of children with RASopathies in order to partition the cognitive, behavioral and social impact of acute complications (leukemia and related treatments) from the more chronic sequelae related to this rare constellation of disorders. Doing so would help clinicians recommend more targeted and individualized interventions which address the patient's long-and short-term symptoms.

The neurological examination revealed significant atrophy of the left shoulder girdle and right quadriceps and absent deep tendon reflexes. Cerebrospinal fluid examination demonstrated albumincytological dissociation, without atypical cells. A spinal MRI showed contrast enhancement of the lumbosacral roots, and a brain MRI was unremarkable. Electrophysiological studies showed normal sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes, no conduction blocks, and no temporal dispersion of compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), with normal latencies of F-waves. Diffuse fibrillation on the four limbs and a reduction in the number of active motor unit potentials was detected by electromyography (EMG). The suspected diagnosis was acute motor polyradiculopathy and pembrolizumab infusions were stopped. Five weeks after symptoms onset intravenous immunoglobulins (0.4 g/kg for 5 days) plus oral prednisone (1mg/kg/day) were started. However, limb weakness progressively worsened, involving distal muscles, symmetrically, with amyotrophy and steppage gait. Two months from onset, ambulation was only possible with bilateral assistance. A new EMG showed marked reduction in the CMAP amplitude of the motor nerves and severe denervation in all groups studied, suggesting diffuse axonal motor damage. The patient was treated with plasma exchange (6 sessions), and two weeks later symptoms stabilized, starting intensive rehabilitation. At the last visit, 4 months from onset of symptoms, the muscle strength had improved in the proximal left arm and right leg.",

The patient was taken for EGD under conscious sedation to evaluate for obstruction. Upon initiation of the procedure, she became unresponsive, bradycardic, and hypotensive, requiring intubation. An abbreviated EGD revealed an impacted almond, but this was not removed due to hemodynamic compromise. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain demonstrated pneumocephalus most prominent in the sulci of the right hemisphere. Chest CT showed pneumomediastinum. Brainstem reflexes, including pupillary light response, were intact. She was unresponsive to voice and had stereotyped, non-purposeful movements to noxious stimuli. Following transfer to a tertiary care center, the almond was removed by EGD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed areas of diffusion restriction in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and right pons. Due to her severe condition on arrival, hyperbaric oxygen was not administered. The following morning, forced downgaze was noted. Repeat CT showed right-sided cerebral edema, effacement of the right frontal horn, and 3mm of midline shift. Hypertonic saline and mannitol were given. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. She remained comatose, and died shortly after ventilatory support was withdrawn. Although the mechanism of the paradoxical emboli remained unclear, insufflation of the esophageal lumen probably allowed air to enter the venous system through scarred and friable mucosa. In the absence of an intracardiac shunt, a large enough quantity of air may have been sufficient to overwhelm endogenous pulmonary filtration mechanisms, allowing access to the arterial circulation. Alternatively, she may have had an undetected PFO or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.",

Antiphospholipid antibodies may be associated with vascular endothelial or subendothelial damage. Anticardiolipin antibodies have been implicated in the acute occlusion of narrowed intracranial vessels. Interestingly, the patient had been on immune suppressive therapy for three years due to plaque psoriasis, another autoimmune condition. Whether or not this led to expedited development of neurosyphilis is unclear. Narrowing of proximal portions of internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery from neurosyphilis compounded by predilection for thrombosis from antiphospholipid antibodies in our patient may have accelerated the natural course of Moyamoya appearance.

Heterozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene are the most commonly known genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD), and reduced peripheral GCase activity has been shown to be a possible marker for PD, both in GBA1 mutation carriers as well as in non-GBA1 mutation PD. Further, GCase activity may be a pharmacologic target in treatment of GBA1 mutation PD. However, the reliability of GCase activity across multiple samples has not been evaluated. Herein, we assess the reliability of GCase activity in a control group and determine the relationship between two methods of measuring GCase activity, dried blood spot (DBS) vs. plasma.",

Physical examination lacked signs of infection or new focal neurological deficits. He was initially treated in the ICU with vasopressors, warming blankets, and empiric antibiotics for presumed sepsis. Investigation for adrenal insufficiency was initiated after sepsis work up failed to identify an infectious source, and there was no clinical improvement after two days. Serum AM cortisol level was 7.6mcg/dL. Functional adrenal glands were indicated by a pretest cortisol of 11.9mcg/dL, increasing to 24.1mcg/ dL an hour after cosyntropin administration. Clinical suspicion for adrenal insufficiency as the etiology of severe malaise and hypotension remained. Persistent hypothermia made hypothalamic dysfunction strongly suspected as the underlying cause. Further pituitary function tests revealed a low ACTH <1.1pg/mL, prolactin 3.1ng/mL and growth hormone 0.10ng/mL while TSH 4.16mIU/mL, FSH 3.7mIU/mL, and LH 5.9mIU/mL were normal. With a past medical history of MS, brain MRI was obtained in an attempt to confirm hypothalamic MS involvement. MRI demonstrated multiple foci of abnormal enhancement consistent with active demyelinating plaques, however none within the hypothalamus. Maintaining a strong clinical suspicion for hypothalamic MS, and given the low sensitivity of imaging studies to identify such lesions, methylprednisolone was administered for five days. Hemodynamic instability rapidly resolved while temperatures increased gradually. Upon discharge, the patient completed a six week prednisone taper. Marked clinical improvement was evident 7 weeks post hospital discharge, as temperature and heart rate normalized, and he endorsed more energy, strength and clarity of thought than he had over the past 1 1 = 2 years.",

Baltimore, MD A person's sense that their life has meaning and that they have the ability to make and achieve future goals has been associated with a number of positive neurologic health outcomes, although it is not clear whether this relationship is causative or merely a correlation. In an effort to begin to test this relationship we first set out to see if an individual's purpose in life (PIL) can be increased through an intervention. In this pilot study, we (1) looked at the effect of an online Multiple Sclerosis (MS) support network (myCounterpane.com) on PIL and (2) tested the feasibility of using an integrated survey with feedback system to measure PIL. Sixty-seven myCounterpane users were consented to the study between January 2015 and January 2016, though the availability of longitudinal PIL survey data was available on a subset of 29 users with multiple sclerosis that was ultimately analyzed. We found that, among MS patients who were able to see feedback from their prior responses, experienced members of myCounterpane were more likely to have an increase in their PIL (112 6 4 SE) over the study period while new members of myCounterpane were more likely to experience in their first 2 months a decrease in their PIL (210 6 5 SE) (p 5 0.005). We also found that with the integrated survey system, 49.3% of all consented participants completed more than one survey, and the implementation of a feedback system did not significantly improve response rates (32.3 6 29.0% without feedback vs. 24.9 6 21.7% with feedback; p 5 0.238). Our findings imply (1) there is an adjustment period associated with joining a support group, though eventually such an environment benefits PIL, and (2) the integrated survey system provides a convenient means to assess PIL in members of MCP, however alternate strategies or implementations of feedback should be considered to increase response rates and retention. There are relatively few data on pharmacokinetics (PK) in elderly populations, and changes in LA pharmacokinetics over time. The current study gives results on PK data at baseline and again at 48 weeks in a group of patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) enrolled in a randomized placebo controlled trial of LA.",

Amphetamines are now increasingly prescribed to adults for maintenance therapy of ADHD and narcolepsy. Reports of sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke have raised concern about their safety profile. Amphetamines produce their effect by increasing the synaptic levels of dopamine, biogenic amines, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The association between amphetamines and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is based solely on case series. Amphetamine-associated stroke is postulated to occur due to a rise in catecholamine levels, vasoconstriction of extra-and intra-cerebral vasculature, or cerebral vasculitis. *To report 3 patients with ADHD on dextroamphetamine/amphetamine and lisdexamfetamine presenting with ischemic strokes.

Physical exam revealed stiff lower extremities fixed at 1808 at the knees and 908 at the ankles. Electromyogram was overall normal but a trial of diazepam provided some symptom improvement. Lab work was positive for elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) autoantibody level of 1128 nmol/L but paraneoplastic antibody panel was otherwise negative. Symptoms improved further with a course of IVIG and she was able to ambulate with a walker prior to discharge. Workup for cancer recurrence was negative. Relief was only temporary and she required inpatient admissions twice more in a sixmonth period. On the third admission, she experienced an intense bout of lower extremity spasms that culminated in a painful \"popping\" sensation in her left hip which x-ray confirmed to be a femoral neck fracture. One week after arthroplasty of the left femur, she had the same painful sensation in the right hip during spasms and x-ray showed a new right femoral neck fracture which was not present when the right hip was imaged during the initial (left-sided) fracture.

            "text": "Malaria is a life threatening disease of humans caused by protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Indeed, poor diagnosis or treatment for malaria often leads to Cerebral Malaria (CM). Consequently, CM is serious form of malaria characterized by seizures, coma and even death. Experimental CM using Plasmodium berghei ANKA infected C57BL/6 mice being widely accepted model that re-iterate major symptoms of human cerebral malaria. Underlying mechanisms of CM pathogenesis includes sequestration of infected RBC, migration of phagocytic cells, release of microparticles and hemozoin via disruption of blood -brain barrier. However, precise mechanism of CM pathogenesis is not completely understood. Those who survived from CM, approx 5-15% of adults and 30% of children suffer from long term cognitive deficits. It appears that excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, hypoxia and recurrent seizures affect the micro environment of brain that alters actin dynamics of dendritic spines in neurons. Neuronal morphology, in terms of its intact arborization pattern and dendritic spine density is critical in maintaining synaptic transmission. Cofilin-1 which is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, plays key role in maintaining the actin dynamics in dendritic spines and thus executing learning and memory functions. In this study, we assessed the morphology of neuronal arborization and its dendritic spine density using Golgi cox staining method. Further, the expression of the cofilin-1 was studied in whole brain lysates of experimental groups i.e. CM, asymptomatic, anemic and control. The results showed loss of dendritic spine density, reduced dendritic arborization and extensive dendritic beadings (pathological feature of altered dendrite) in the neurons of CM infected brains. The expression of cofilin-1 was significantly reduced in the CM infected brain which is the hallmark of imbalance of the actin dynamics during the pathology. These findings suggest that altered morphology of neurons at ultra structural level could be attributed to cofilin-1 levels in the brain after experimental CM. This may help to establish newer therapeutic strategies aiming long term cognitive impairment after CM. Objective: To describe a case in which non-infectious lateral cerebral sinus thrombosis masquerades as infectious cerebral sinus thrombosis due to imaging results concerning for mastoiditis.",

A CT scan has a sensitivity of 97% for infectious mastoiditis, the hallmark finding being osseous destruction of the mastoid air cells. Background: Sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia and associated electrocardiographic (E.C.G) abnormalities are common among stroke survivors. Stroke is known to damage the central autonomic pathway which in turn causes significant cardiovascular dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis. Heart Rate Variability (H.R.V) is a commonly used measure for studying cardiovascular autonomic modulation. Therefore we felt studying H.R.V could throw some light on cardiovascular autonomic balance post stroke. Thus H.R.V and cardiovascular reflex autonomic function tests were compared between right hemispheric and left hemispheric lacunar stroke patients.",

Some of these challenges are common across prospective cohorts, a setting in which CCS has had limited application. Other challenges are unique to FHS. For example, in the earliest epochs, strokes were investigated using different technology, including pneumoencephalography, angiogram, and LP. CT scanning was unavailable before 1976 and brain MRI before 1990. Lifetime pre-and poststroke information is available using cohort data and CCS is ambiguous about how this additional information should be incorporated. Examples of such data include multiple EKG's or ambulatory recording for atrial fibrillation, multiple echocardiograms and carotid ultrasounds, and cardiac CT/ MRI. Review of delayed brain MR imaging can localize strokes not visualized on acute imaging. Despite these caveats, the CCS proved applicable to the FHS cohort with high inter-observer concordance. Agreement between current FHS and CCS subtypes is predicted to be moderate, and will be analyzed with a larger sample.",

GC is DSMB member and/or consultant. Background: The incidence of clinical depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is 5-fold greater than that of the general population (25% vs 5%, respectively). Natalizumab inhibits the migration of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by acting as an a4 integrin antagonist, reducing inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS). SENTINEL, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial, was completed in 2005 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natalizumab vs placebo in combination with IFNb-1a in relapsing remitting MS patients who presented with at least one relapse in the prior 12 months. The primary aim of this study was to explore whether natalizumab reduced the severity of depression in depressed patients with MS who participated in the SENTINEL trial.",

James Potts: Employee of Biogen and holds stock and/or stock options in Biogen Following the introduction of the national immunization program for children in 1983, Japanese encephalitis (JE) was nearly eliminated in South Korea; over the past 3 decades fewer than 0.02 cases per 100,000 population have been reported annually. However, JE has reemerged since 2010, and we herein presented the epidemiological data focusing on the recent increase of JE cases in South Korea. From 2010 to 2015, 129 JE cases were reported. The median age of the patients with JE was 53 years and 43.4% were female patients. On an average, affected female patients were older than male patients (p 5 0.017). Patients aged 50-59 were the most affected group (37.2%), followed by those aged 40-49 (24%), whereas the patients aged under 19 accounted for only 3.1% cases. Regarding the geographical distribution, 45% of cases originated in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, and Gyeonggi Province, the area surrounding Seoul. The case fatality rate for JE increased from 9.1% to 21.3% (2010-2014) (p 5 0.055). It is suggested that the reemergence of JE not only represents a numerical increment of cases, but also represents an association with increased disease severity. Although epidemiology of JE is largely contingent on the ecology of vectors and amplifying hosts, total numbers of mosquitoes, and the individual numbers of Culex Tritaeniorhynchus, collected every year have been gradually declining since 2010. In addition, seropositive rates for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in swine have steadily decreased, reaching 10.2% in 2015. The surveillance data indicate that additional factors may have contributed to recent outbreaks of JE. In terms of public health, close attention is required concerning the gradual increase in cases of JE and policies regarding adult vaccination against JEV. We report a case of a comatose patient with CNS MTB infection whose initial workup revealed nonspecific meningoencephalitis with multiple negative CSF and sputum AFB stains.",

The range of Propofol infusion used was 50 to 80 micrograms/kilogram/hour with aim for sedation and to control focal epileptiform discharges found later on electroencephalogram. By day 2 of admission, he developed acute renal dysfunction, progressing to high anion-gap metabolic acidosis, episodic bradycardia, elevated troponin, rhabdomyolysis and hypertriglyceridemia by day 3 of admission. The Propofol infusion was discontinued on day 2 with total duration of about 48.5 hours of its use, resulting in a cumulative dose of 3.66milligram/kilogram.

Most of his symptoms improved after discontinuation of the Propofol infusion, hence supporting this clinical diagnosis. Most of the PRIS cases described in literature occur at cumulative Propofol dose above 5milligram/kilogram, sometimes after over 96 hours of infusion, but our patient developed this syndrome at 3.66 milligram/kilogram cumulative dose (within just 48.5 hours of use). An awareness of this possibility is critical as this syndrome still carries an unacceptably high mortality rate of at least 35%. Presence of sepsis possibly delayed the diagnosis of PRIS in our patient. A watchful observation for PRIS symptoms in daily clinical practice in presence of confounding/overlapping syndromes like sepsis, shock etc. can be challenging. In absence of specific investigative tests and bio-markers, high clinical suspicion remains the crux of early diagnosis of this potentially lethal complication.",

The senses and intellect were normal. However, over time patients showed progressive deterioration including speech and swallowing dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, delirium, and depression. Parkinson reviewed prior literature on similar conditions, apologized for lack of anatomic information, but urged his readers to study such patients. In 1884 Charcot proposed that the condition be referred to as \"Parkinson's disease.\" While many are familiar with Parkinson's contribution to movement disorders, an appreciation of Parkinson's diverse interests and accomplishments is generally lacking. in 1795, he attended a series of anatomic lectures by John Hunter and transcribed them using short hand. In 1800 he published the Hospital Pupil which summarized attributes important for a medical career and offered suggestions for a medical school curriculum. He recommended oversight of drug production and sales. He authored guides to topics of interest to the lay public such as the Villager's Friend and Physician. He was also highly critical of political and social inequities and published essays under the pseudonym of \"Old Hubert.\" This political radicalism nearly lead to him being imprisoned. Parkinson urged good childrearing, and avoidance of dangerous sports. He proposed reform in mental health care and the process of incarceration. In his later years, he devoted attention to his longstanding interest of geology and paleontology. In 1978, Melvin Yahr noted that \"in all of his activities, Parkinson brought the approach of keen astute observation, good deductive reasoning, and above all, an empathy for and desire to benefit mankind. By every criterion, he was truly a physician for all seasons.\" Background: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis[LMC] is characterized by infiltration of the pia mater and arachnoid membrane by malignant cells. It is estimated to occur in 5%-8% of cancer patients and represents an advanced stage of cancer. While seen in all malignancies, it is quite rare in solid tumors, especially in those of gastric origin. It is important to recognize LMC early as it has a poor prognosis and treatment options are limited. We describe a case of LMC presenting with headache in a patient with gastric cancer.",

The most common presentation of LMC is headache or altered mental status. Gadolinium enhanced MRI can be used to diagnose LMC. However, the gold standard is a positive cytology on cerebrospinal fluid studies. Overall survival in LMC is short with a median survival of 4-5 weeks without treatment, and 2-4 months with treatment. Treatment options include intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic chemotherapy and best supportive care. Methotrexate is the most widely studied and the most commonly used intrathecal agent, but cytosine arabinoside has been used for the same as well.

Pathological fracture of cervical spine due to MM is very rare. Vertebral artery is susceptible to injury or occlusion at C5-C6 vertebral level, atlanto-axial joint, and atlanto-occipital joint secondary to stretching or tearing of intima or compression of the artery following cervical fracture or dislocation. Intima tear can trigger platelets aggregation and clot formation which can lead to embolic stroke. CTA and MRA are non-invasive diagnostic techniques that can be used to evaluate vertebral artery dissection, whereas cerebral angiography is reserved for cases in which these modalities are non-diagnostic. Treatment with anticoagulants is recommended for six months in patients who have neurological symptoms from extracranial dissection.

The tremulous movements particularly affected the head and trunk, occasionally involved the extremities. These movements were triggered or aggravated by action or tension, usually lasted from minutes to hours, and alleviated by relaxation. He recalled clumsiness while running at approximately age 15 during school sports. His family history was negative. Neurological examination revealed wide-based gait ataxia with inability to tandem walk, dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, bilateral gazeevoked horizontal nystagmus, and mild cerebellar dysarthria. Multifocal myoclonus was observed predominantly in the trunk and arm. A trunk tremor was present in the supine position or during walking. A cerebral MRI in this patient showed cerebellar atrophy, most pronounced in the vermis. EEG monitoring revealed no focal disturbances or epileptic phenomena. Targeted exome sequencing of the patient DNA revealed a c.401G>A (p.Cys134Tyr) variant in exon 5 of PRKCG, which was predicted to be pathogenic using in silico prediction algorithms (SIFT and PolyPhen-2). In addition, this mutation was not found in 128 controls of Chinese, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database and the 1000 Genomes Project. Combined with the absence of the c.401 G>A variation in his parents, we concluded that this PRKCG variant was a pathogenic de novo mutation, originating in the index patient or possibly in the (germline) cells of one of his parents. For symptomatic treatment, the patient was started on an increasing dose of clonazepam 1 mg at night for three days, building up to a treatment dose of between 2-4 mg in divided dose daily.

Most of the striatopallidal lesions are located in the lentiform nucleus, especially the putamen, whereas the thalamic lesions were centered on the ventral intermediate and ventral caudal nuclei. Compared with the clinical features of dystonia observed after lesions of the striatopallidal system, dystonia in patients with thalamic lesions was characterized by action and posture myoclonus and dystonia of the hand. Upon literature review, all patients with jerky dystonia due to thalamic infarction, affected hand (jerky dystonic hand), except only one patient who reported jerky dystonia with shoulder involvement. Herein, we report two patients with multiple risk factors for stroke, who developed jerky dystonic shoulder movements in one month and 8 months respectively, after posterior thalamic infarctions. The cause for the proximal, rather than distal, upper limb involvement, is unclear. Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) is caused by ATP1A3 gene mutations and has been recently shown to affect several cognitive domains, including executive function. This study aims to investigate the neuroanatomical substrates underlying RDP-associated effects on executive function. We hypothesized that RDP may affect components of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CbTC) pathway thought to be affected in other movement disorders and known to play a role in executive function.",

A high-fat diet has been associated with worse disease phenotype in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Contribution to the severity of the human disease is unknown. This analysis is the product of an ongoing casecontrol study at 16 US centers of environmental risk factors in pediatric MS (18 years at onset). Patients who had available prospectively collected relapse data included in this analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used. The model was adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and presence of disease-modifying treatment at enrollment. 219 patients with pediatric relapsingremitting MS were included in this study. In multivariable analyses, each 1% increase in energy intake from fat increased the hazard of relapse by 4% (adjusted hazard rate (HR) 1.04, CI:1.0-1.09, p50.04). In contrast, patients with high vegetable intake had a lower hazard of relapses (adjusted HR: 0.58, CI:0.35-0.96, p50.03). These associations remained with mutual adjustment and persisted when adjusted for baseline 25(OH) vitamin D serum level. This study suggests that high energy intake from fat may increase the hazard to relapse in children while vegetable intake may be protective. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder, where patients develop characteristic lesions in the central nervous system whose pathological features differ depending on the stage of lesion development. However, MS tissue is not routinely available for pathological analysis. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) recapitulates many radiological and pathological features of focal white matter MS lesions, providing opportunities to investigate how such lesions develop and the timing of pathogenic factors involved. Using serial MRI, we tracked lesion development, and further characterized lesions using histopathology targeting various markers, including fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is a marker for blood-brain-barrier leakage, and also has been investigated for its pathogenic role in MS lesion development. Our data show that fibrinogen leaks from blood vessels in early, active lesions, and its distribution pattern depends on lesion age. Lesions that are up to two weeks old show patchy fibrinogen deposition around the central vein, whereas fibrinogen is cleared from older lesions by phagocytes.",

Homozygous GRN mutations, on the other hand, lead to complete PGRN loss and cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease usually seen in children. Since the predominant clinical and pathological features of FTD and NCL are distinct, it is controversial whether the disease mechanisms associated with complete and partial PGRN loss are similar or distinct.

Data in humans suggest that most recovery from motor impairment occurs in the first 4 weeks after stroke and is mediated in part by increased responsiveness to training in this short time period which we call the sensitive period. Based on these data, we tested three hypotheses. First, that there is a gradient of diminishing responsiveness to training in the first week after stroke in the mouse. Second, the counterintuitive prediction that a second stroke should reopen the sensitive period and lead to paradoxically enhanced recovery from a first stroke with incomplete and plateaued recovery. Third, that fluoxetine can extend the sensitive period. Using a skilled prehension task, we show that training-associated recovery of prehension was complete if training was initiated after a 1-day, post-stroke delay but incomplete if training was initiated after a 7-day, post-stroke delay, even with additional training days. At post-stroke day 21, induction of a second focal stroke in the medial premotor area of mice with plateaued recovery led to a dramatic response to early post-stroke training with recovery to normal performance. Daily fluoxetine administration poststroke was associated with complete recovery of prehension.",

Los Angeles, CA Cerebral microvascular disease is a leading cause of stroke and vascular dementia causing diffuse and focal ischemic lesions predominantly within brain white matter. Both lesions are progressive, implying cascading biologic pathways, driven by chronic risk factors including metabolic syndrome (MetS) that impact multiple cell types. To better characterize the effect of MetS on the oligovascular unit and the response to focal white matter stroke, we utilized a variety of transgenic, molecular, and stroke modeling approaches. MetS is associated with a decrease in microvascular volume in the corpus callosum, altered axonal microdomain organization, lost axoglial contact, and ultrastructural disruption of myelin. In part, these changes result from MetS-induced changes in the oligodendrocyte lineage. To determine the effect of MetS on the transcriptional profile of diseased cerebral endothelia within the white matter, we used cell specific RiboTAG and RNAseq to identify a number of disease-induced vascular signaling pathways including the IL-17/CXCL5 inflammatory chemokine pathway that may exert its action on the oligovascular unit. Together, these results identify the basic cellular mechanisms that mediate cerebral microvascular disease and identify new therapeutic targets for vascular and white matter repair.",

Sixty percent of males are at risk for rapidly progressive cerebral inflammatory demyelination (Eichler et al. 2007; Moser et al. 2007) . A major challenge facing clinicians is the lack of biomarkers to determine which patients carrying the mutation will develop cerebral disease. Selective brain endothelial dysfunction (Musolino et al. 2015) and increased permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) as indicated by contrast extravasation on brain MRI (Loes et al. 2003) suggest that white matter microvascular dysfunction contributes to the phenotypic conversion. Using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion imaging we analyzed a cohort of ALD patients and found that ABCD1 deficiency causes high microvascular flow heterogeinity in the white matter regions and developmental stages with highest susceptibility for conversion to cerebral disease. When this is followed by an increase in BBB permeability lesion progression ensues. These abnormalities normalize one year after treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here we report for the first time in-vivo the effect of ABCD1 upon microvascular flow physiology in white matter at risk of inflammatory demyelination.",

A nested case-control analysis from the ISUIA was performed to assess whether a sex differential exists in the response of human cerebral aneurysms to aspirin. Aneurysms were induced in mice using hypertension and elastase injection into mice basal cisterns. Aspirin decreased the risk of aneurysm rupture more significantly in men than in women in the ISUIA. In mice, aspirin and COX-2 inhibitor significantly decreased the incidence of rupture. The incidence of rupture was significantly lower in male versus female mice on aspirin. PCR of cerebral arteries showed higher 15-PGDH levels in male mice. The rate of cerebral aneurysm rupture was similar in male mice receiving aspirin and 15hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor compared with females receiving aspirin and 15-PGDH agonist, signaling a reversal of the sex-differential response to aspirin. Aspirin decreases aneurysm rupture in human and mice, in part through COX-2 pathways. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests a consistent differential effect by sex. 15-PGDH activation in females reduces the incidence of rupture and eliminates the sex-differential response to aspirin.

Understanding the mechanisms for the cell loss may provide novel molecular targets for improving myelin integrity in human disease. Elevated [Cl -] i , associated with depolarizing action of GABA, is observed in early brain development and in pathological conditions. We evaluated whether acute trauma increases [Cl -] i in the neocortex and thalamus and if it is also affected by development. Neuronal [Cl -] i was imaged by multiphoton microscopy in acute thalamo-cortical brain slices from Clomeleon mice at post-natal days 5 to 20. We observed: 1) [Cl -] i is higher in the most superficial areas, close to the cutting edge, in both neocortical and thalamic brain slices at all ages and, 2) there is a developmental decrease in [Cl -] i independent of acute trauma caused by brain slicing. We conclude that [Cl -] i has a developmental progression during P5-20 in both the neocortex and thalamus independent of brain trauma. However, in both brain regions and during development, neurons closest to the slicing trauma have an elevated [Cl -] i . Trauma induced changes in [Cl -] i are key to the understanding of the effects of GABA A receptor allosteric modulators on injured tissue. The human frontal lobe has greatly increased in size and complexity compared to other mammals. To study the manner in which this region continues to develop postnatally, we followed young neurons from the walls of the lateral ventricles and sub-ventricular zone (V-SVZ) to their final cortical destinations using high-resolution MRI, histology, and time-lapse confocal microscopy. We discovered a prominent population of Doublecortin (DCX)1 migrating young neurons in a stream we refer to as the Anterior Arc. These cells were distributed widely throughout the frontal lobe invading multiple cortical areas in the first three months of life. These young neurons expressed markers of interneurons and their entry into the anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with the emergence of specific subtypes of inhibitory neurons (NPY, Somatostatin and Calretinin). DCX1 cells expressed transcription factors associated with ventral progenitor regions, the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE). Altogether, these data reveal a major migration of young neurons into the frontal lobe that may contribute to changes to the neural circuit composition and its maturation during early infancy. Defects in this migration could result in circuit defects that underlie neurodevelopmental disorders. Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common childhood epilepsy syndrome and characterized by a transient period of seizure susceptibility of uncertain duration in school-age children. A biomarker of epilepsy remission would provide invaluable prognostic information for these children and guide decisions regarding anticonvulsant drug treatment. In addition, identification of clinically accessible biomarkers to track epileptogenicity in childhood epilepsy may provide candidate biomarkers to target in other populations at risk.",

Standard basal ganglia models and the short duration response to levodopa suggest that striatal dopamine acutely influences motor function. It is also clear, however, that striatal dopamine influences implicit learning processes. How these dual functions of dopamine relate to clinical parkinsonism is unclear, and difficult to determine with interventions that operate over hours (e.g., pharmacology) or longer (e.g., lesions). Precisely timed optogenetic inhibition of midbrain dopaminergic neurons during acquisition and performance of fine motor skills allows us to separate \"learning\" and \"performance\" roles of striatal dopamine. We employed a rat skilled reaching task with real-time computer vision to precisely time optogenetic suppression of dopamine neurons during reaches. Our preliminary results suggest that dopamine neuron suppression at reach onset does not influence reach trajectory, but reduces the likelihood that rats will perform future reaches. Ongoing studies aim to distinguish motor from motivational effects of dopamine neuron suppression, define functional subpopulations of midbrain dopamine neurons, and examine how the timing of dopaminergic neuron activity influences motor skills. There are a host of influences that contribute to cognitive and behavioral changes following Deep Brain Stimulation. The location of the active cathode relative to the Subthalamic Nucleus and other neighboring structures is likely an important variable but one that has received little attention. Here, we measured contact location and examined associations with a range of outcomes in 46 patients (mean age 5 60.9 1/-8.1, 38 males) who underwent unilateral or bilateral Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation for treatment of idiopathic Parkinson disease. Correlational analyses indicated that medial/lateral and anterior/posterior contact locations in the left hemisphere were particularly influential for depression, semantic fluency, and phonemic fluency outcomes. Memory outcome, on the other hand, was related to right-hemisphere stimulation voltage, which is likely a proxy for variable electrode location. These findings have implications for understanding the functional divisions of the Subthalamic Nucleus as well as for surgical targeting and intraoperative testing procedures.",

We study the medial frontal cortex of patients with Parkinson's disease and animal models using a combination of EEG, single neuronal recordings, and brain stimulation techniques. We report three main findings. First, patients with Parkinson's disease have attenuated $4 Hz rhythms in mid-frontal cortex during cognitive tasks. Second, this $4 Hz rhythm synchronizes single neurons involved in cognitive processing in the human subthalamic nucleus and throughout frontal, cerebellar, and striatal brain areas in rodents. Third, optogenetically stimulating frontal neurons expressing dopamine receptors at 4 Hz in animal models can compensate for dopaminedependent cognitive deficits. These data indicate that 4 Hz activity is a key mechanism of cognitive control that malfunctions in Parkinson's disease, and could provide new insight into cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Mutations in ATP13A2 have been shown to lead to both juvenile Parkinson disease (PARK9) and a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN12). We generated a novel Atp13a2 knockout mouse and characterized phenotypic and neuropathologic features of this PARK9/CLN12 model. Knockout animals showed impaired neuromotor performance and decreased survival compared to wild-type littermates, with a significantly larger proportion of spontaneous deaths. Neuropathology revealed age-dependent accumulation of autofluorescent and Periodic Acid Schiff-positive storage material in the brains of knockout animals. Both astrocytic activation and microglial activation were observed in Atp13a2 -/-mice, along with Purkinje cell dropout. Our data indicate that these Atp13a2 -/-mice recapitulate many of the core features of the human disease. Methods: 29 participants with MS underwent 7T brain MRIs.

Saratsis, Tina Huang, Andrea Piunti, Rintaro Hashizume, Elizabeth Bartom, Tadanori Tomita, C. David James and Ali Shilatifard. Chicago, IL Histone H3 is increasingly thought to play a role in pediatric gliomagenesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a powerful method for studying epigenetic control of gene expression by histone proteins. However, the paucity of fresh tissue from rare or surgicallyinaccessible tumors, like pediatric brainstem glioma, limits application. Since cell culture conditions may alter the tumor epigenome, ChIP-Seq of formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) tumor, derived via biopsy or autopsy, could serve as a reasonable alternative approach. We performed the first successful ChIP-Seq of FFPE pediatric brain tumor tissue, to our best knowledge, as an alternative to fresh tissue analysis. Genomic deposition of H3K27M, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac was determined via ChIP-Seq of FFPE pediatric glioma tissue (n58) using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit and Illumina NextSeq 500. H3K27M was determined via Sanger Sequencing. Genomic enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac was detected in chromatins extracted from H3K27 wild-type FFPE glioma, consistent with ChIP-Seq of pediatric glioma cell lines (n53). Analysis of H3K27M mutant glioma specimens is currently underway. ChIP-Seq of FFPE pediatric glioma tissue is technically feasible, and may provide new insight into the biology of these rare, highly aggressive tumors. Neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia is a major cause of newborn death and chronic neurodevelopmental disability in children, although limited therapies are available for its prevention and treatment. The family of NAD1 biosynthetic enzymes, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) are known to protect injured peripheral axons from degeneration. However, the role that the other NMNAT isoforms play in immature neuronal survival after cerebral injury remains unexplored. Utilizing a NMNAT3overexpressing mouse line and adeno-associated viral vectors we demonstrate that the mitochondrial-associated NMNAT isoform, NMNAT3, protects the immature brain from the degenerative effects of neonatal H-I. NMNAT3-neuroprotective mechanism involves a decrease in the degradation of calpastatin, and a concomitant decrease in caspase-3 activity and calpain-mediated cleavage. Conversely, NMNAT3 knockdown in cortical and hippocampal neurons in vitro promoted neuronal fiber degeneration and increased glutamate-dependent excitotoxic neuronal cell death. The effects of NMNAT3 knockdown on neurodegeneration were significantly reduced by exogenous upregulation of NMNAT3 suggesting that endogenous NMNAT3 is important for sustaining neuronal survival during baseline conditions and following excitotoxic injury. Understanding the neuroprotective properties of NMNATs in the injured developing brain may offer new therapeutic targets against the effects of birth asphyxia in humans. Axonal degeneration has been consistently observed after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, molecular pathways underlying the pathology of TBI-related axonal injury remain poorly understood and there is no efficacious treatment for TBI. We show that mice lacking the mouse Toll receptor adaptor Sarm1 (sterile a/Armadillo/Toll-Interleukin receptor homology domain protein) gene, a key mediator of Wallerian degeneration, demonstrate multiple improved TBI-associated phenotypes after mild TBI. Strikingly, Sarm1 knockout mice had significantly fewer beta amyloid precursor protein-stained axon profiles in the corpus callosum after TBI when compared to wild type mice. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of the phophorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H were reduced in knockout mice indicating preserved axonal integrity after TBI. Importantly, there was a strong early preservation of neurological function in Sarm1 knockout mice when compared to wild type animals. Last, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy tissue signatures were consistent with preserved neuronal energy metabolism in knockout animals compared to wild type mice early after TBI. In summary, our results indicate that the Sarm1-mediated prodegenerative pathway promotes pathogenesis in TBI. Exploring anti-Sarm1 therapeutics may represent a novel viable approach for preserving neurological function after TBI. (Petit-Pedrol et al., Lancet Neurol, 2014) . Two recent studies suggested that the c2 subunit was also a target, but the associated clinical features were unclear (Pettingill et al, Neurology, 2015; Ohkawa et al. J Neurosci 2014) . We examined for GABAAR antibodies 2916 samples from patients referred to our laboratory for antineuronal antibody studies and analyzed their GABAAR subunit specificity.",

Low titer patients experience the same disease course as mid-titer and high titer ant-AQP4 patients with NMOSD.

Animal studies suggest that Ab concentration and deposition may be modifiable through manipulation of the sleep-wake cycle. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to determine if Ab concentrations in the human central nervous system are modifiable through manipulation of sleep. We collected serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples via indwelling lumbar catheter every 2 hours for 36 hours in adults 18-60 years old during behavioral sleep deprivation (N512), pharmacologic sleep induction with sodium oxybate (N512), and control (N512). All participants were infused with 13C6-leucine to measure Ab kinetics via isotopic enrichment. Ab40 and Ab42 isoforms were quantitated by mass spectrometry. Sleep-wake activity was monitored with polysomnography. We found that concentrations of Ab40 and Ab42 increased 25-30% during sleep deprivation compared to control. This increase occurred during the sleep period, hours 18-24 or 01:00-07:00. Participants treated with sodium oxybate were found to have a greater decrease in Ab40 and Ab42 area under the curve compared to control (p<0.05). Sleep is hypothesized to be the primary driver of the Ab diurnal pattern. Since changes in Ab concentration of 25-40% have been associated with causing or preventing Alzheimer's disease, manipulation of sleep has potential as a preventive therapy. Future investigations will be needed to assess if Ab concentrations are increased in individuals with poor sleep quality compared to controls and if this increase can be normalized with a sleep-inducing medication.",

CD11b antibody antagonism reduced NMSS to near normal levels. This was associated with a statistically significant increased mean dorsal caudal tail nerve (DCTN) amplitude, and increased mean DCTN and sciatic nerve conduction velocities and reduced mean DCTN and sciatic nerve total waveform durations compared to vehicletreated (phosphate buffered saline) and isotype antibodytreated mice. Histopathological assessments showed statistically significant reductions in the mean numbers of F4/801 monocytes/macrophages, CD31 T-cells and total CD11b1 mononuclear leukocytes, as well as the mean percentage demyelinated area per axial section. Compared to 2 g/kg human IVIg given over 5 days, CD11b treatment resulted in more favorable NMSS, motor nerve electrophysiology demyelination parameters and histopathological assessments of inflammatory demyelination. Consistent with in vitro observations of AIDP patient leukocyte trafficking at the BNB under flow, electron photomicrographs of active leukocyte transmigration in sural nerve biopsies of AIDP patients demonstrated paracellular leukocyte infiltration with intact electron-dense intercellular junctions between endoneurial endothelial cells and between these cells and infiltrating leukocytes.

Several studies and our own data indicate that SMN expression is developmentally regulated with decreasing levels during neuronal differentiation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the dynamic expression of SMN. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been shown to be powerful regulators of proteincoding gene expression. Many lncRNAs that transcriptionally regulate gene expression bind to the epigenetic modifier Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2), which represses gene expression. Many lncRNAs exhibit regionally specific expression in the central nervous system, and some have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Given their role in neuronal development, lncRNAs could represent promising targets for therapeutics. Results: We identified a 1.6 kb long antisense transcript arising from the SMN locus that we named SMN-AS1. This nuclear transcript is enriched in the central nervous system in humans and in SMA mice. SMN-AS1 expression levels are developmentally regulated and inversely correlate with SMN levels. SMN-AS1 recruits PRC2 to the SMN promoter to repress its transcription. SMN-AS1 knockdown in human SMA fibroblasts and in primary neurons isolated from SMA mice increases SMN expression in a dosedependent manner. Interference with SMN-AS1 expression in SMA mice results in increased SMN expression, improves motor behavior and increases lifespan when combined with a low, sub-optimal dose of SMN2 splicing oligonucleotide.",

Frank Rigo and Frank Bennett are employees of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a company developing treatments for SMA. Expansion of GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucelotide repeats in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of ALS/FTD spectrum disorders (C9-ALS/ FTD). To gain insight into the pathogenesis of C9-ALS/ FTD, we utilized a Drosophila model that replicates many of the key features of this disease including age-dependent neurodegeneration, ubiquitinated protein inclusions that label with p62/SQSTM1(Sequestosome-1), and axonal transport disruption. This screen has identified at least three important cellular pathways that regulate G4C2 repeatmediated neurodegeneration including: nucleocytoplasmic transport, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Disruption of each of these cellular pathways may cause cytoplasmic accumulation of misfolded proteins and has been implicated in ALS. Importantly, in collaboration with the Rothstein laboratory, we have validated nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption in iPS neurons and brain tissue from patients with C9-ALS. Our data suggest that the toxic cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 seen in almost all forms of ALS may be caused by an impairment in nuclear import.",

Using genetic epsistasis experiments, we propose a model for pathogenesis in which p62-containing protein aggregates inhibit the proteasome and induce ER stress. Interestingly, neurodegenerative phenotypes are suppressed by knockdown of p62, suggesting that this ubiquitin-binding protein mutated in rare forms of familial ALS is required for neurotoxicity downstream of G4C2 repeat expression. Ongoing experiments are investigating the mechanism of this toxicity and the interrelationship between protein aggregate formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption. Antibodies against glycine receptors (GlyRAbs) have been found in some patients with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), and in patients with related acquired neurological syndromes (Carvajal-Gonzalez, 2014) . The clinical features of PERM, which include muscle rigidity, exaggerated startle responses, oculomotor and autonomic disturbance, are consistent with a disruption of spinal and brainstem inhibitory circuits.

Pharmacologically isolated glycinergic currents have a shorter decay time than GABAergic currents. We use this difference in time course to separate the two components, in the absence of pharmacological blockade, to quantify the contribution of glycinergic neurotransmission to mIPSCs. We compare the contribution of glycinergic neurotransmission to mIPSCs recorded from neurons incubated in patient IgG or control IgG for up to 24h prior to recording.

However, when adoptively transferred to wild-type mice, these AQP4-reactive T cells mount an inflammatory attack in the spinal cord and optic nerves very similar to human NMO disease.

Background: The apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (SAD). However, the mechanisms that underlie pathogenic nature of ApoE4 in SAD are not well understood.

We have found that the levels of phosphoinositol biphosphate (PIP2) are reduced in human and mouse brain tissues of ApoE4 carriers.

Further research is needed to understand the individual and system level factors driving this difference. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been proposed as an ALS therapy by virtue of their secretion of neurotrophic factors and alteration of the immune system. We have now completed a Phase I, dose-escalation clinical trial of intrathecal autologous adipose-derived MSC therapy for ALS. 27 patients with El Escorial clinically-definite ALS were enrolled and treated intrathecally at escalating doses (10 million x 1 dose, 50 million x 1 dose, 50 million x 2 doses monthly, 100 million x 1 dose, and 100 million x 2 doses monthly). The median age was 57 (range 36-75) and 15 were male. The median follow-up was 289 days (range 27-759) and there have been 12 deaths, none of which were attributed to MSC therapy (median death 334 days following injection (range 27-755)). The safety profile was positive, with the most common side-effects reported being temporary low back and leg pain at the highest dose level. Although the study was not designed for efficacy, ALSFRS-R was performed throughout the study and showed progression in all patients that did not appear, and was not reported by any patients, to be more rapid than prior to MSC therapy. Despite overall progression, 17 patients reported specific temporary clinical improvements following treatment. MSC therapy at the 50-100 million doses were associated with elevated CSF protein, nucleated cells and MRI imaging of thickened lumbosacral nerve roots. Preliminary autopsy data did not reveal any tumor formation, and may suggest implantation of MSCs in the lumbosacral nerve roots. Biomarker studies of peripheral blood immune status and CSF miRNA are ongoing. In conclusion, intrathecal treatment of autologous adipose-derived MSCs appears safe at the tested doses in ALS. These results warrant further exploration in a multi-treatment Phase II trial, and our design for this will be presented.",

Ann Arbor, MI Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating illness which results in progressive degeneration of the motor neurons. There is currently no cure and treatment options are incredibly limited. Previous studies have demonstrated that the immune system plays a dual role in ALS pathogenesis: it can protect against or exacerbate neuronal damage. It is therefore critically important to determine the role of specific immune cell populations during the course of disease. Immune cells from the peripheral blood are capable of altering disease pathogenesis; however, despite strong evidence that the immune system plays a significant role in ALS pathogenesis, clinical studies have yet to identify an upregulated cell population in the peripheral blood of ALS patients. Cells known as natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells play a key role in killing cancerous or infected cells in the body and are also capable of skewing the immune system towards a more destructive response. Our data show that NK cells and a subpopulation of NKT cells -CD31 CD41 CD81 cells -are significantly increased in the blood of ALS patients and that the number of these cells increases over time. Moreover, we find that the number of CD31 CD41 CD81 cells is increased in the peripheral blood of SOD1G93A ALS mice as the disease progresses. Unlike anti-inflammatory cell types that are currently being studied for use in ALS therapeutics, such as regulatory T cells, NK and NKT cells are purely proinflammatory and can be targeted in the blood using methods of depletion.

Inhibition of BACE1 in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain has been shown to significantly reduce the accumulation of beta amyloid (Ab) and improve cognitive function. Exogenous delivery of Fbx2 into mouse brains using AD (Tg2576) mice, a transgenic mouse model, has shown improvement in synaptic plasticity and decrease in accumulation of Ab.

We assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal formation and short-term memory by the fear conditioning freeze test. We found that 18-24 month old TgFbx2/Tg2576 mice showed a significant improvement with regards to LTP in hippocampal formation and shortterm memory, compared to their Tg2576 littermates. These improvements are associated with a reduction in BACE1 levels and Ab accumulation in the brain. We further investigated the underlying mechanism by which the NMDAR-CaMKII-MAPK-CREB signaling pathway, which is downregulated in Tg2576 AD brain, was rescued by the overexpression of Fbx2 in double transgenic mice Tg2576/ TgFbx2. Our study demonstrated that Fbx2 promotes BACE1 ubiquitination and degradation, which reduces Ab toxicity and rescues the cAMP-CREB synaptic signaling pathway. This suggests that Fbx2 could be a novel therapeutic target for AD treatment. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important; however, none of the current biomarkers can differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment from cognitively healthy controls. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the core molecule involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory. , which suppresses the expression of BDNF, is known to be elevated in the brain of AD patients.

Clinical performance is the straightforward measure; however, clinical tests can be too broad, or lack reliability, or they may be better if complemented by other methods. We evaluated relationships between regional atrophy in brain MRI and treatment effects in 21 PPA patients under an orthographic treatment condition (OTC) and a phonological treatment condition (PTC), with Prophylaxis items (named correctly at baseline) and Remediation items (named incorrectly at baseline). Left temporal regions had significantly lower volume in the PPA patients at baseline, compared to 11 controls. We then examined the relationships between baseline volume within each of the left temporal regions and the treatment effects for Exemplar 1 (a set of pictures that was tested at baseline, utilized during treatment, and tested at one month posttreatment) in PPA. We found negative correlations between the treatment effect for Remediation items in OTC and volume of left inferior temporal gyrus and pole, regions that have been associated with semantic processing2,3.

Decatur, GA and Atlanta, GA Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is known to have a strong genetic basis that is incompletely understood. Prior work with families that inherit AD as an autosomal dominant trait focused on large pedigrees, primarily, with early-onset AD (EOAD; AD onset before 60-65 years). That work led to discoveries of AD-causing mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and helped establish the role of beta-amyloid in AD pathogenesis. By comparison, there have been relatively few investigations of families with late-onset AD that appear to transmit the disease in a dominant manner, which is likely due to difficulties with ascertainment. Here, we present a unique extended pedigree that has been systematically recruited since 2001 at the Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center with apparent autosomal dominant transmission of late-onset AD. This pedigree is remarkable in a number of ways: (1) the parent-offspring concordance for AD is 44.3%, suggesting AD is dominantly inherited in this pedigree (v250.2056, df51, p50.65); (2) detailed genealogy data are available on 2710 members spanning 3 main branches with between 7 and 11 generations from the original founders; (3) biologic material is available on 175 individuals, including 24 with AD, 5 who have mild cognitive impairment and 27 who are cognitively normal but at-risk for AD (i.e., older than 60 years); (4) 11 autopsies have confirmed AD as the primary neuropathologic diagnosis among affected individuals; and, (5) sequencing of all coding exons of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 revealed no coding mutations in 15 affected individuals. To identify causal mutations, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 6 of the most distantly related affected individuals. No unique or rare variant (MAF <5%) was shared among all individuals. There were 153 variants unique to the pedigree shared by >2 individuals. We found a single deleterious variant shared by 3 individuals when filtering by candidate regions that show significant or nominal association with AD in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The gene, RAB31, has markers with p-values of $10-6 in GWAS and has been previously been implicated in age-dependent effects on blood pressure. Validation of all variants by 2-point linkage within the pedigree described herein is ongoing.",

Seattle, WA Mutations in Presenilin 1 or Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) cause autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD), establishing a pathogenic role for these genes in AD associated neurodegeneration. Presenilins form the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex which cleaves, in addition to APP, numerous substrates mediating diverse cell functions across multiple CNS cell types including immune cell regulation. While dysregulation of innate immunity is emerging as a relevant contributor to neurodegenerative disease, the molecular pathogenesis of neuroimmune dysfunction in AD is not clear.

To reduce chronic denervation in nerves, we propose the transplantation of motor neurons to effectively reduce the time and distance necessary for regeneration by creating a relay to the muscle.

Analysis of Schwann cell activation capacity by electron microscopy and expression analysis of three markers of active Schwann cells (c-Jun, p75, ErbB3) showed they were more capable of activation in animals transplanted with motor neurons than those treated with negative controls. Thus, motor neuron transplants into the peripheral nerve was able to maintain the regenerative capacity of twoand three-month denervated nerves by serving as postsynaptic targets to regenerating fibers as well as supporting pro-regenerative host cells during the denervated state. These findings suggest novel uses of stem cells and nerve guides to improve recovery after peripheral nerve injury.

Chicago, IL Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) play central role in the initiation and modulation of voluntary movement due to their unique ability to receive and integrate inputs from different regions of the cerebral cortex, and to transmit this information to distinct segments of the spinal cord with distinct precision. CSMN degeneration is thus an important aspect of motor neuron diseases. We recently generated and characterized a novel reporter line for CSMN, the UCHL1-eGFP mice, in which CSMN are genetically labelled with eGFP expression that is stable and long lasting, allowing their visualization and detailed cellular analysis. Since TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) is an evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding nucleoprotein involved in various functions, and that TDP43 pathology is one of the most common pathologies observed in ALS patients, we generated a CSMN reporter line with TDP43 pathology by crossing UCHL1-eGFP with hTDP-43A315Tmice, which recapitulate most ALS pathology and offer a great tool to study cellular basis vulnerability.",

            "text": "Discussion: HIV-MND was associated with activation of HERV-K in blood from a locus on chromosome 22. There was also an immune response to HERV-K. Elevated HERV-K levels responded to optimization of antiretroviral therapy for CNS penetration. All HIV-MND patients showed improved or slowed disease course with increased ARV CPE. Neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with neuronal injury and cell death associated with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) and activated microglia. To determine their relative contributions to disease progression, we examined autopsy tissue specimens of 30 ALS patients (16 with lower extremity onset, 14 with bulbar onset), and evaluated the interrelationships of pTDP43 pathology, microglial density, and neuronal loss to clinically determined sites of onset and disease duration. We hypothesized that microglial activation would be driven by neuronal injury and enhanced pTDP43, and that clinical onset would dictate neuropathology -e.g. clinical lower extremity onset would be associated with increased TDP-43 and activated microglia in the lumbar region, and bulbar onset would be associated with increased TDP-43 and activated microglia in the dorsomedial medulla. Microglial density was quantitated using a color based segmentation algorithm of Iba1 immunofluorescence preparations in lumbar and cervical ventral horns, medullary pyramid and olive, dorsomedial medulla, and cerebellar white matter. Neuronal loss was assessed using Nissl-stained sections of medulla, cervical spinal cord, and lumbar spinal cord. pTDP43 density was examined using immunofluorescence preparations through hypoglossal nuclei, reticular formation of medulla, inferior olive, and lumbar horn of the spinal cord. Surprisingly, a dissociation of pathologies by clinical onset site was not seen, as lower extremity patients had greater microglial densities in both medulla and cord (dorsomedial medulla, p 5 0.03 and lumbar cord, p 5 0.06) and greater neuronal loss in cervical cord (p 5 0.03) and lumbar cord (p 5 0.03). Further, microglial density across all regions-of-interest was strongly associated with decreased patient survival (p 5 0.008). A similar trend was seen between greater pTDP-43 density and reduced survival, particularly in lumbar cord (p 5 0.06), although pTDP-43 did not differ between groups by site of onset, did not differ between c9orf72 expanded and wild-type groups, and was not associated with neuronal loss. These findings are not in accord with a hierarchical progression of pathologies and some patients have more diffuse pathology than clinical onset alone would suggest. This interpretation is tempered by the cross-sectional view inherent in autopsy material but suggests opportunities for further translational studies. Moreover, these results suggest that microglial density, independent of symptom onset site, is strongly associated with decreased survival in ALS. In DMD, NF-jB in muscle is activated from infancy, driving inflammation, muscle degeneration and inhibiting muscle regeneration. CAT-1004 is an oral small molecule that inhibits NF-jB and improves muscle degeneration, regeneration, and function preclinically. In Phase 1 trials in adults, CAT-1004 was generally well tolerated without safety signals and evidence of NF-jB inhibition was seen after single and multiple doses. The MoveDMD trial is evaluating CAT-1004 in boys aged 4-7 with genetically confirmed DMD not on glucocorticoids for at least 6 months. As previously reported, Part A evaluated safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics over 7 days at three doses of 33, 67 and 100 mg/ kg/day (N517), with exploratory measures of NF-jB activity. CAT-1004 was generally well tolerated, without serious adverse events or drug discontinuations. AUC and Cmax were consistent with previously observed levels in adults at which inhibition of NF-jB was seen. Genes enriched for NF-kB targets were assessed in whole blood by mRNA sequencing. Compared with baseline, two independently curated NF-jB gene sets were significantly down-regulated (Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values of 3.4310 -2 , and 1.2310 -7 for the two gene sets in the high dose cohort). Several gene transcripts in the TLR and Fc receptor pathways, including TLR4 and FCGR2A were reduced after a week on CAT-1004 (ANOVA p<0.05 and FDR<0.05 in pooled analysis compared to baseline). These results support a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in $30 boys aged 4-7 with DMD, with T2 MRI of leg muscles as the primary endpoint and functional measures as secondary endpoints. By reducing inflammation and muscle degeneration with potentially positive longer-term effects on muscle regeneration and function, CAT-1004 may have potential to be disease-modifying in DMD patients, regardless of mutation type.",

Recent evidence suggests that SD disrupts memory consolidation through multiple mechanisms, including the downregulation of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In this study, we tested the effects of brain bioavailable bioactive polyphenol precursors on the attenuation of sleep deprivation-induced cognitive deficiency. We found sleep deprivation leads to significantly impaired contextual memory compared to the vehicle group (% of freezing: 31.66 6 2.001 vs. 56.66 6 3.248, respectively, p < 0.001). Combination treatment with two polyphenol precursors currently identified in our laboratory, quercetin and malvidin-3-O-glucoside, restored the sleep deprivation-induced contextual memory (% of freezing: 41.87 6 3.780 vs. 31.66 6 2.001, p < 0.05). To further explore mechanistically, we explored in vitro potential signal transduction pathways that may be responsible for beneficial effects of these brain bioavailable bioactive polyphenol precursors. Excitingly, we found that treatment with 250 nM of malvidin-3-Oglucoside and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide significantly increases CREB phosphorylation in primary hippocampal-cortico neurons. Interestingly, we also found that malvidin-glucoside also significantly increases the level of phospho-p70S6K on Thr412. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with malvidin-glucoside in primary neurons increases the phosphorylation of p70S6K and its upstream kinase, mTOR, and the activation of mTOR and p70S6K can be blocked by rapamycin, an mTOR signaling-specific inhibitor. Collectively, our study provides new information that the polyphenol precursors quercetin and malvidin-glucoside may significantly attenuate sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment in mouse model of acute sleep deprivation through mechanisms associated with activation of mTOR pathways. Our data suggests the feasibility of using select brain-targeting polyphenol compounds derived from a complex polyphenol mixture as potential therapeutic agents in promoting resilience against sleep deprivation-induced cognitive dysfunction.",

Importantly, CNS IL-12p70 may have beneficial effects on cognition and brain atrophy in AD, as opposed to IL-23 and p40. The beneficial role of IL-12p70 was further corroborated by the findings that it protects neurons against Ab and glutamate toxicity and increases the antiapoptotic secreted form of Clusterin. Background: With over 20 AD risk genes discovered and replicated in large-scale genome-wide association studies, we still cannot fully explain the genetic heritability of AD. The missing heritability may be explained by mechanisms that result in aberrant transcription of these genes.",

Persistence of hypertension and a rapid decline in blood pressure during mid-tolate life are both strongly associated with increased dementia risk. This is the first study to reliably report an association between mid-life systolic hypertension (!140 mmHg) and clinically confirmed dementia in late-life. Carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and nonstenotic carotid plaque are suggested markers of carotid atherosclerosis and may be related to cognition in the elderly. We hypothesized that individuals with greater cIMT or with carotid plaques would exhibit worse cognition at baseline and have greater cognitive decline. Stroke-free Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) participants had carotid ultrasound and repeated neuropsychological (NP) testing. Carotid IMT and plaques were imaged with standardized B-mode ultrasound protocols and analyzed by a certified sonographer. We used multivariable linear regression to examine cIMT, plaque presence, and plaque area as correlates of domain-specific NP Zscores cross-sectionally and after six years follow-up. We also investigated effect modification by APOE e4 allele status. Neuropsychological testing was performed among 1166 participants at baseline and among 826 participants at follow-up (mean56.2 years). The mean cIMT was 0.93 6 0.09 mm (mean age5 71 6 9 years; 60% women; 15% white; 18% black; 67% Hispanic white). Participants with greater cIMT had worse episodic memory at baseline after adjustment for demographics and vascular risk factors (beta520.60, P50.04). APOE e4 carriers with greater cIMT exhibited worse episodic memory (beta521.26, P50.04), semantic memory (beta521.35, P50.01), and processing speed (beta521.22, P50.02) at baseline. Participants with greater cIMT at baseline did not exhibit cognitive decline in episodic or semantic memory, but did exhibit decline in executive function and processing speed, though these associations did not reach significance. The APOE e4 allele was a significant effect modifier: participants without an APOE e4 allele who had greater cIMT at baseline exhibited more decline in executive function (beta5-1.03, P50.05). Neither plaque presence nor area was significantly associated with cognitive performance in any domain in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. Results remained similar after restricting the analysis to those who were categorized as cognitively unimpaired at baseline based on their Mini-Mental Status Examination score. Our cross-sectional findings in this race/ethnically diverse community-based urban sample suggest that being at elevated genetic risk of Alzheimer disease as well as having a greater vascular disease burden may have cognitive consequences. A greater burden of vascular disease may have domain-specific cognitive consequences in the absence of genetic Alzheimer disease risk. Atherosclerotic lesions may be less important in the pathology of vascular cognitive changes, but larger studies are needed. Arterial wall thickening due to compensatory and inflammatory arterial remodeling are mechanisms that should be explored in future studies.",

Metabolic syndrome is a prevalent condition that associates with painful polyneuropathy especially in the elderly population. However, little is known about how the aging process increases the peripheral pain sensitivity in metabolic syndrome. In the current study, we used high-fat-diet (HFD) to induce painful polyneuropathy in young (5 wk-old), mature (36 wk-old), and aged (72 wk-old) mice to study the age-related molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of painful polyneuropathy in metabolic syndrome. In HFD-treated mice, symptoms of metabolic syndrome, including increased body weight, fasting blood glucose, and plasma cholesterol levels were detected. In addition, increased sensitivity to mechanical (mechanical allodynia) and thermal (thermal hyperalgesia) stimuli were detected in hind paws of HFD-treated mice after 5 wk, 3 wk, and 1 wk of HFD treatment in young, mature, and aged mice respectively. In addition, increased proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and reduced anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 expressions in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (LDRG) were detected in mature and aged HFD-treated mice. Fenofibrate (0.1% in diet) treatment reduced plasma cholesterol and improved impaired fasting blood glucose levels in HFD-treated mice. However, fenofibrate treatment had no effect on the pain behaviors in HFD-treated mice. In contrast, exogenous IL-10 (1 g/kg, ip) treatment significantly improved HFD-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia and, in parallel, inhibited the upregulation of TNF-a in LDRG of HFD-treated mice. In addition, IL-10 treatment reduced the activation of epidermal inflammatory langerhans cells and macrophages in the hind paw skin of HFD-treated mice. These results suggest that there is age-dependent cytokine-mediated neurogenic inflammation that contributes to the development of painful polyneuropathy in metabolic syndrome. This mechanism is independent of glycemia status and dyslipidemia. Targeting cytokine-mediated inflammation could be an effective approach for treating painful polyneuropathy in elderly patients with metabolic syndrome.",

Background: Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are being designed to allow individuals with tetraplegia and locked-insyndrome to control assistive communication and environmental control devices. A core component of BCI technology is a decoder: an algorithm that translates neural information into command signals for external devices. Recent studies have used linear regression to map kinematic variables to firing rates, with subsequent smoothing using linear averaging or Kalman filtering. However, the relationship between firing rates and motor commands may be highly nonlinear. To address this limitation, we developed a non-parametric decoding algorithm that we call the Gaussian-process discriminative Kalman filter (GPDKF). The innovation of this approach is that we are able to learn the relationship between neural firing behavior and motor commands, rather than having to define an explicit parametric model. Importantly, the method yields an analytic solution with interpretable parameters, and provides a principled approach to dealing with signal noise.

            "text": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Patients typically die within 3-5 years from onset of symptoms secondary to respiratory failure. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying ALS and its treatment remain elusive to date with one of the reasons being lack of suitable disease models. The discovery of mutations in SOD1 in canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) has provided naturally-occurring disease model as a 'tool' for study of ALS Objective: To share the natural history, clinical staging and histopathology of canine DM Results: Canine DM is a naturally-occurring, adult-onset, progressive disease that, like ALS, leads to paralysis and death. The earliest clinical signs begin when the dog is 9 years or older. Asymmetric spastic weakness and general proprioceptive ataxia in the pelvic limbs (stage 1) progresses to paraplegia (stage 2) within 1 year from onset of signs. At disease onset, spinal reflexes are consistent with upper motor neuron (UMN) loss. Dog owners often elect euthanasia when their dog becomes paraplegic. When euthanasia is delayed, weakness spreads to the thoracic limbs (stage 3) and LMN signs emerge as flaccid quadriplegia (stage 4), widespread muscle atrophy, dysphagia and loss of bark. The pattern of clinical progression of canine DM is relatively uniform within breeds and between breeds. Histopathologic changes include gliosis and neuronal fiber degeneration and loss of sensory and motor pathways that are most severe in the mid-to caudal thoracic spinal cord.",

            "text": "Stefanie Geisler, Ryan A. Doan, Amy Strickland, Jeffrey Milbrandt and Aaron DiAntonio. Saint Louis, MO Peripheral polyneuropathy is a very common, potentially doselimiting side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents despite manifold disparate mechanisms of action. Most neuropathies are characterized by early axonal degeneration suggesting that the various insults of chemotherapies converge in a common axonal degeneration program. Unfortunately, therapies that inhibit this axonal destruction process do not currently exist. Recently, others and we discovered that genetic deletion of Sarm1 dramatically protects axons from degeneration after axotomy in mice. This finding fuels hope that inhibition of Sarm1 or its downstream components can be used therapeutically in patients threatened by axonal loss. However, axon loss in most neuropathies, including chemotherapy induced neuropathy, is the result of subacute/chronic processes that may be regulated differently than the acute, one time insult seen in axotomy. Here we evaluate if genetic deletion of Sarm1 decreases axonal degeneration in a mouse model of neuropathy induced by the commonly used chemotherapeutic agent vincristine. In wild-type mice, four weeks of twice-weekly intraperitoneal injections of 1.5mg/kg vincristine caused a significant decrease in tail compound nerve action potential (CNAP) amplitude, pronounced loss of intra-epidermal nerve fibers and significant degeneration of myelinated axons in the distal sural nerve. The predominantly motor tibial nerve assessed at the same proximal-distal level as the distal sural nerve and the proximal sural nerve did not have axon loss. These findings are consistent with the development of a length-dependent, sensory predominant axonal polyneuropathy that closely mimics vincristine induced polyneuropathy (VIPN) in humans. Using the same regimen of vincristine treatment in Sarm KO mice, the loss in tail CNAP amplitude was prevented. In addition, Sarm KO mice did not have significant loss of unmyelinated fibers in the skin or myelinated axons in the sural nerve after vincristine. These findings indicate that genetic deletion of Sarm1 improved functional outcome following vincristine as shown by rescued nerve conductions and reduced degeneration of myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Our results reveal for the first time that subacute/chronic axon loss induced by vincristine occurs via a Sarm1 mediated axonal destruction pathway. This further establishes Sarm1 as the central determinant of a fundamental axonal degeneration pathway that is activated by diverse insults. We suggest that targeting Sarm1 or its downstream effectors may be a viable therapeutic option to prevent VIPN and possibly other peripheral polyneuropathies. Objective: Present natural history of 75 patients with ALS followed prospectively over 12 months from entry into a clinical trial.",

Such antibodies include anti-Yo, found in patients with gynecological and breast cancers and cerebellar degeneration; anti-Hu, associated with encephalomyelitis in the setting of lung cancer; and anti-Ri, found in patients with ataxia and opsoclonus in the setting of breast or lung cancers. Neurons have traditionally been assumed to exclude IgG, and for this reason it has been considered unlikely that these antibodies could play a role in disease causation. However, it has never been established that neurons are impermeable to IgG; and our previous studies, using organotypic (slice) cultures of rodent brains, have demonstrated that antineuronal antibodies such as anti-Yo, anti-Hu, and anti-Ri are readily taken up by neurons and can directly cause cell death. More recently, we have shown that neuronal IgG uptake does not depend on the immunoreactive Fab portion of the IgG molecule but rather is dependent upon the Fc portion. We have also shown that neuronal uptake of paraneoplastic antibodies can be inhibited by preincubation of cultures with normal IgG. Although these observations suggests that neurons might possess Fc receptors, little work has been done to determine the nature and distribution of Fc receptor expression on CNS neurons In this study, we probed paraformaldehyde-fixed mouse and rat brains sections with antibodies for the three major types of Fc receptors: FccRI (CD64), FccRII, (CD32) and FccRIII (CD16). Expression of FccRI receptors, but not FccRII and FccRIII receptors, was identified on multiple populations of neurons throughout cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. Our work demonstrates that neurons possess previously unidentified Fc receptors capable of binding IgG. Although the biological function of these neuronal receptors is unknown, their presence suggests a mechanism through which antibodies reactive with intracellular neuronal proteins could be taken up, bind to their target antigens, and cause neuronal injury and death.",

In this study, we show that BBI inhibits development of Th17 cells and reduces Th17 cell encephalitogenicity by suppressing their GM-CSF production and decreasing their numbers in the CNS of EAE mice. We also demonstrate that BBI induces IFN-c production in Th17 cell culture, and that lack of IFN-c or IFN-cR abrogates Th17 suppressive effect of BBI. In addition, BBI requires IL-27R, Stat-1, T-bet, and IL-10 to inhibit Th17 development.",

Rochester, MN Myelopathy is a common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis, and when present often represents the initial and only clinical feature despite common concurrent subclinical pulmonary involvement. Thus, identification of radiologic clues to distinguish spinal cord sarcoidosis (SCS) from other myelopathies is important. We have observed a unique pattern of central canal gadolinium enhancement in SCS which, when combined with dorsal subpial enhancement, (a recently described characteristic feature of SCS) forms a distinctive \"trident\" appearance. Nine patients (78% women) were included of which eight were Caucasian and one was African-American. The median onset age was 43 years (range, 33-63). MRIs showed central canal enhancement alone (11%) or in combination with dorsal subpial enhancement (89%) forming the hallmark axial \"trident-like pattern\". Serum angiotensin converting enzyme was normal in all. Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities included: elevated white blood cell count, 9 (median 55/mcL; range, 23-248), elevated protein, 9 (median, 98 mg/dL; range, 49-242) and CSF hypoglycorrhachia, 2. Lung biopsies in seven patients revealed non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis, and two patients without pathological confirmation had hilar adenopathy. We have not encountered this radiologic pattern with myelopathies of other etiologies. Identification of central canal enhancement and the trident sign in subacute myelopathy strongly suggests SCS.",

            "text": "Conclusions: A multidisciplinary neuroinflammation precision medicine board is an innovative and efficient way to achieve consensus about complex interpretation and potential clinical application of rapidly advancing and evolving genomic and proteomic technologies in neurological diagnosis. We have shown that systemic Lipopolsaccharide followed one day later by brief focal cerebral ischemia and brief systemic hypoxia produces myelin and axonal injury in cortex and hippocampus of adult rats (Zhan et al., J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;46(2):507-23). The myelin injury is associated with formation of aggregates of myelin basic protein and other myelin proteins which form the nidus for deposition of APP and abeta. These myelin-abeta aggregates have the shape and distribution of amyloid plaques seen in mouse Alzheimer's Disease models (AD) and in human AD brain. We proposed that the myelin aggregates formed amyloidlike plaques in this model. To determine if this model is relevant to human AD brain pathology we performed two subsequent studies. We examined human AD brain for evidence of myelin injury and aggregates. Evidence of myelin injury in AD cortex included increased degraded Myelin Basic Protein (dMBP) in AD gray matter compared to control (p < 0.001) and dMBP in AD neurons. Evidence of interaction of AbPP/Ab1-42 with myelin or axonal components included greater binding of dMBP with AbPP in AD brain; MBP at the margins of amyloid plaques; dMBP colocalized with Ab1-42 in the core of amyloid plaques in AD brains; and interactions between Ab1-42 and MBP/ dMBP by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. We concluded dMBP and MBP associate with amyloid plaques and dMBP associates with AbPP and Ab1-42 (Zhan et al., J Alzheimers Dis. 2015;44(4):1213-29). In the present study we determined if LPS and other molecules from gram negative bacteria were present in AD brain. E. coli K99 pili protein and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were detected immunocytochemically in brain parenchyma and vessels in all AD and control brains. DNA sequencing confirmed that E. coli DNA was found in human control and AD brains. E. coli K99 protein levels by Western blots were greater in AD compared to control brains and K99 was localized to neurons in AD but not control brains. LPS colocalized with Ab1-40/42 in amyloid plaques and with Ab1-40/42 around vessels in AD brains. We conclude that LPS is co-localized with amyloid in plaques and around vessels in AD brain, and combined with the rat model, suggest LPS could play a role in producing myelin injury and forming plaques in human AD brain.",

Infection with HIV commonly causes HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) despite life-prolonging combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). There is substantial evidence that interferon-alpha plays a role in cognitive impairment in HAND. We have previously shown that a decoy protein that sequesters type I interferons, B18R, ameliorates HIV induced histopathology. We tested if coadministration of B18R with cART provides enhanced protection from HIV encephalitis in comparison to B18R or cART treatments alone in a mouse model of HAND. After 10 days of treatment mice were sacrificed and brains extracted and frozen for tissue sectioning. Five micron coronal sections were immunostained for a neuronal marker (MAP2), astrocytes (GFAP), HIV (p24) and mononuclear phagocytes (CD45). The data suggests that B18R simultaneously administered with cART reduced encephalitis markers more than either of the two treatments administered alone. In a separate set of experiments, B18R was tested for its ability to reverse behavioral abnormalities of HAND mice using an Object Recognition Test (ORT). The ORT was administered to HAND mice and controls before and after treatment with B18R. ORT showed a strong trend in the reversal of behavioral impairment in HAND mice treated with B18R. Because of its ability to act in concert with cART as well as reverse behavioral abnormalities in HAND mice, B18R is a potential therapeutic agent for a Phase I trial in HAND patients.",

Given the helpful but limited effects of language therapy, the neuromodulation technique transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently been used to supplement language therapy. In a previous study we showed that tDCS over the left IFG coupled with language therapy was significantly more beneficial than language therapy alone: therapy gains were longer sustained and generalized to untrained items (Tsapkini et al. 2014 ). In the present study, we aimed to assess the effects of anodal tDCS combined with language therapy (mostly spelling intervention) on language and cognitive functions not introduced in therapy.

Evidence suggests that effects of SMD and neurocognitive dysfunction are bidirectional and complex, with genetic, environmental, and behavioral causes (Biessels et al., 2014) . It has been recently shown that the underlying pathology does not resemble that of AD (Abner et al., 2016) . Studies using contrast-enhanced MRI show agedependent blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in the hippocampus, worsening with mild cognitive impairment and correlating with injuries to the BBB pericytes (Montagne et al., 2015) . Rodent models have also implicated the hippocampus in cognitive deficits resulting from T2DM (Stranahan et al., 2008) . Consequently, we propose to create a hippocampal network model (HNM), using metaanalytic co-activation modeling (MACM) and structural equation modeling (SEM), to detect and quantify network abnormalities associated with neurocognitive decline in SMD. Our immediate research goal is to create functional and structural meta-analytic connectivity maps (FMACM and SMACM) of the hippocampi in order to develop the HNM that can be used to assess cognitive impairments in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Our preliminary data has found 13 key nodes of functional connectivity with each individual hippocampus (right and left) all of which address highly significant behavioral paradigms known to be affected in individuals with dementia (i.e. working and explicit memory, cognition, etc.) We hypothesize that SMACM and FMCAM will jointly identify an extended hippocampal connectivity network with different components being associated with different behavioral domains and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Galveston, TX A number of neurodegenerative disorders associated with dementia and motor dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease with dementia are characterized by the accumulation of aggregated tau protein. However, while neurofibrillary tangles comprised of tau filaments are the classical hallmark of these diseases, our lab and others have shown that intermediate aggregates-tau oligomers-are in fact the most toxic form of tau. Therefore, we created a tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody (TOMA) in order to specifically study the toxic oligomeric tau, as well as for use as a therapeutic agent. We characterized tau pathology in three different animal models: P301L mutated tau mice, non-mutated human tau mice and Tg2576 mutated amyloid precursor protein mice. We then evaluated the preventative and reversal efficacy of targeting tau oligomers in each mouse model by passive immunotherapy with TOMA. Following treatment, we evaluated the cognitive and motor function of P301L mice and memory in human tau and Tg2576 mice. We found that targeting tau oligomers in both the tauopathy mouse models and the Alzheimer's disease mouse model attenuated memory loss, as well as reduced motor dysfunction in P301L mice. Following behavioral analysis, we collected brain tissue for biochemical and immunohistological analysis for levels of pathological tau and markers of neuronal dysfunction. We found that in both tauopathy mouse models, TOMA treatment significantly lowered levels of tau oligomers without affecting tau monomer or neurofibrillary tangles. Additionally, in the Tg2576 mouse model we found that pathological amyloid-b was lowered with treatment as well as tau oligomers. Additionally, dendritic spines in mice treated with TOMA were significantly larger than spines in control transgenic mice, suggesting that synaptic transmission may be improved with treatment, underlying cognitive benefits. We have previously demonstrated that tau oligomers likely mediate the toxicity and spread of pathology in disease. Collectively, the findings reported here support the idea that eliminating tau oligomers by passive immunotherapy may be an effective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and a number of other tauopathies. Background: Large genome-wide association studies of non-Hispanic Whites with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have identified over 20 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) albeit with weak effects. Polygenic risk scores represent an alternative strategy to summarize sparse genetic information and identify profile risks. LOAD has been shown to have a significant polygenic component in case-control studies but this has never been investigated in families multiply affected by LOAD.",

            "text": "1 Mutations in collagen VI cause a spectrum of muscle disease ranging from severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy to the milder Bethlem myopathy. The three protein components of collagen VI encoded by Col6a1, Col6a2, and Col6a3, undergo extensive assembly after translation before being excreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix (ECM). Collagen VI is an integral component of the ECM, making collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD) prototypical disorders of the muscle ECM. However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of how collagen VI absence from the ECM results in muscle weakness, atrophy, degeneration, and fibrosis remain unknown. In this study, we introduce a new mouse model of COL6-RDs, characterized by homozygous inactivation of the Col6a2 alleles (Col6a2-/-) and characterize the histologic and functional changes associated with this genotype in skeletal muscle fibers. Col6a2-/-mice show histologic abnormalities including myofiber atrophy, degenerating and regenerating myofibers, increased internalized nuclei, and increased fibrosis that worsen over time, consistent with a dystrophic myopathy. These findings correlate with decreased performance on functional assessments (e.g. grip strength) and ex-vivo physiologic measures (e.g. tetanic force) compared to wild-type and heterozygous controls. Similar to patients, they exhibit typical, albeit milder, histologic and functional changes. Dysregulation of growth factor signaling, which is closely regulated by the ECM, may play a significant role in pathogenesis of this disease. Col6a2 knockout mice serve as a novel animal model for COL6-RDs and can be used to study these mechanisms and test efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in preclinical studies. Conclusion: M. lepraeinfected Schwann cells undergo proliferation for a long period without sensory fiber degeneration and this depicts an early preclinical model of peripheral neuropathy in armadillos. LEP-F1/GLA-SE immunization appears to be safe on small sensory fibers with no evidence of early nerve fiber injury.",

Skin biopsies are a well-tolerated tool to establish tissue diagnosis for FAP, demonstrate sensory neuropathies and well as a biomarker marker in therapeutic clinical trials. Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). Although the mechanisms underlying ALS pathology remain largely unknown, damage to inhibitory interneurons and subsequent MN excitotoxicity plays a major role in disease pathogenesis. Human spinal stem cells (hSSCs) could restore inhibitory tone to motor neurons by forming new inhibitory synapses. We recently completed Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials examining safety and dosing of hSSC in ALS patients and our supporting preclinical data showed that these cells form a small percentage (about 2%) of inhibitory synapses onto host MNs. The present study aims to test our hypothesis that increased inhibitory tone rescues MNs from excitotoxicity, and that enriching inhibitory synapse formation in hSSCs will more efficiently reverse MN pathology in ALS models.",

For in vivo testing, a T13-L1 laminectomy was performed in 60d SOD1G93A ALS mice, and injections of hSSC, hSSC-Dbx2, or vehicle control were targeted to the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord.

This demonstrates that in ALS, hSSC may provide increased inhibitory tone by the formation of new inhibitory synapses. We next established hSSC-Dbx2, a novel cell line with robust inducible Dbx2 expression. Intraspinal injection of hSSC and hSSC-Dbx2 successfully targeted the ventral horn in the SOD1G93A mouse. Although no differences were observed in motor performance to date, studies are still ongoing. Quantification of inhibitory synapses and MN survival at the study end will confirm the role of hSSCmediated inhibitory synapse formation in ALS. In conclusion, our findings suggest that reversal of excitotoxicity in ALS via restoration of inhibitory tone is a potential therapeutic mechanism of hSSCs and support further development of enhanced stem cell therapies to translate to patients. Background: Accurately assessing the risk of respiratory insufficiency in Guillain-Barr e syndrome (GBS) has important implications for triage and determining frequency of respiratory monitoring.

New York A number of recent human studies indicate that psychosocial stressors increase peripheral cytokine production and may be an important factor in the development of major depressive disorders (MDD). Subsets of patients with MDD have higher levels of multiple inflammatory markers, including the cytokine Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a central role in brain reward circuits, and synaptic plasticity of the NAc is critical for resilience to stress-induced depression/anxiety. Using a model of repeated social defeat stress (RSDS), we demonstrated that stressmediated long-term disruptions in NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) synaptic plasticity and induction of IL-6 in the periphery are key factors contributing to depression/anxiety phenotypes. We found that dietary supplementation with a novel polyphenol rich preparation (PRP) undergoes significant gastrointestinal microbiota metabolism leading to generation of selective bioactive PRP metabolites in the circulation to promote resilience to depression/anxiety phenotypes in the RSDS model. We found that treatment significantly promotes resilience to RSDS-induced depression/ anxiety phenotypes, compared to vehicle-treated control mice. In particular, we found that the treatment significantly improved social interaction ratio compared to vehicletreated control mice (1.8 6 0.8 vs. 1.1 6 0.4, p<0.05) associated with significant reduction in inflammatory IL-6 circulatory levels. These changes coincided with an improvement of anhedonia, as assessed by sucrose preference test following chronic social stress (74.3 6 14.4% vs. 31.9 6 24.8%, p<0.01). Our studies strongly support the role of the intestinal microbiome in contributing to the benefits of a novel PRP in promoting resilience to stress-induced depression/ anxiety through generation of select PRP metabolites. Gnotobiotic mice are currently being developed through fecal transplantation of select commensal microbes characterized by enhanced generation of PRP metabolites in vitro to allow further investigation in vivo for the contribution of select microbiota in attenuating RSDS-induced depression and anxiety. This study attempts to derive a calibration model for the measurement of cerebral angiographic details on deidentified images lacking a scale. The retrospective measurement of anatomical details on cerebral angiography (CA) such as vessel diameter for stent placement and aneurysm size is complicated by the loss of the calibration scale during the transfer of data from interventional angiography systems to a picture and communications system (PACS). This is a three part study including a systematic literature review, development of a calibration model, and validation of the model on a separate set of images. A systematic literature review of the mean diameters of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and the internal carotid artery (ICA) was performed, analyzing data from approximately 7,000 patients to quantify vessel diameter variability. This review was followed with a retrospective analysis of 107 CA images, establishment of a set range of diameters, the determination of the most commonly used scales for neuroimaging analysis in CA, prioritization of these scales, and the overall creation of a model for the conversion of Pixel Diameter to Actual Diameter. It was determined that the models created were, on average, correct within 0.1177 mm and 5.3% (p<0.0001), 0.1387 mm and 5.0% (p<0.005), and 0.1357 mm and 3.8% (p< 0.05) for the ACA, MCA, and ICA respectively. This model forms the basis for a computer program that can be used to automate the measurement of CA imaging for use by clinical trials and patient care. Objectives: Over the last four years we have conducted a quality improvement project, INSIGHTS, to examine the clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiologic criteria of neuromuscular patients prescribed IVIG across the US Background: IVIG is commonly used off-label for treatment of exacerbations and for maintenance therapy of myasthenia gravis (MG). Due to a lack of positive controlled trials, there is tremendous variability in the types of patients who are prescribed IVIG for MG in clinical practice.",

            "text": "Alzheimer's Disease Through Mechanisms Involving Short Chain Fatty Acids and Phenolic Acids Lap Ho, Jeremiah Faith, Kenjiro Ono, Simoni Tiano and Giulio M. Pasinetti. New York and Tokyo, Japan There is increasing evidence supporting a protective role of intestinal microbiota against diverse medical conditions, including neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulation, in part, of metabolic and immune responses. For example, gut bacteria metabolize soluble dietary fiber into biologically available short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that may help modulate immune responses in the periphery and in the brain. Gut bacteria are also known for their role in converting dietary polyphenols into biologically available phenolic acids with anti-oxidant activities. However, there is little information on the potential role of SCFAs and phenolic acids in AD. The present study is designed to investigate effects of these SCFAs and phenolic acids in beta-amyloid (A\u00df)-mediated pathologic processes that play key roles in AD pathogenesis. We conducted in vitro studies using multiple complementary assays to investigate individual SCFAs and phenolic acids that are generated by gastrointestinal (GI) microbial metabolism of dietary fiber and polyphenols for their dose-responsive effects in interfering with the assembly of A\u00df peptides into neurotoxic soluble A\u00df aggregates. We also conducted in vitro studies investigating effects of isolated human GI bacteria in converting dietary fibers and select polyphenol products into biologically available SCFAs and phenolic acids that are effective in inhibiting A\u00df aggregation. We found several phenolic acids that potently inhibited A\u00df aggregation. We also found significant differences among GI microbiota from different healthy human donors in converting dietary polyphenols into these bioactive phenolic acids and in further metabolic degradation of these phenolic acids. Ongoing studies are investigating effects of individual SCFAs in A\u00df aggregation and the efficacy of GI microbiota from different human donors in the generation (and degradation) of these SCFAs. Intestinal microbiota may help protect AD, in part, by supporting the generation of phenolic acids and SCFAs that interferes with the formation of toxic soluble A\u00df aggregates. Presence of interpersonal differences in the human gut microbiota may lead to interpersonal variation to benefit from the protective effects of dietary fiber and polyphenols in AD. Outcomes provide critical information for developing probiotics to help prevent and/or treat AD. Background: The relationship between cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and cognitive impairment or dementia has been widely studied with significant variability in findings between groups. We hypothesized that chronic small vessel injury in the form of arteriolar sclerosis, measured quantitatively (using MRI T2 volumetric analysis of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes), would identify specific CVD risk factors and patterns of cognitive decline, associated with mild cognitive impairment of the cerebrovascular type (MCI-CVD), that represent the core features of vascular cognitive impairment in our Kentucky \"stroke-belt\" population, at risk for cognitive decline and the future development of dementia.",

Background: Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase1 (GBA1) gene are the most frequently observed genetic contributor to Parkinson's disease (PD) worldwide. GBA1 related PD is characterized by more prominent cognitive decline than idiopathic PD, and GBA1 mutations are the genetic factor most commonly associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Thus, it is possible that GBA1 mutations could be associated with cognitive decline independent of PD, or that a cognitive prodrome might be present in a subset of at-risk gene carriers. On the other hand, elderly mutation carriers might have genetic modifiers or other factors that mitigate disease and are responsible for the markedly reduced penetrance of this gene. The goal of this study was to examine cognitive function in at-risk GBA1 gene carriers without PD or DLB.",

However, our study was limited by power from the relatively small sample size, and most of the carriers were N370S carriers. Previous research has demonstrated variable expression of GBA mutations, therefore it possible that an effect may have been observed with a larger proportion of severe mutation carriers. Further longitudinal study with a larger sample that includes individuals with a range of mutation types is warranted. We previously utilized proteomic sequencing of postmortem human brain to identify novel proteins that may contribute to disease pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that important disease associated proteins could also be identified in cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We therefore performed dual mass spectrometry followed by quantitative proteomic analysis to characterize the CTE insoluble brain proteome. We identified many significantly enriched targets, including NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1), a protein involved in the reduction of reactive oxygen species. Protein blotting confirmed NQO1 enrichment in the insoluble brain fraction and also identified a more global increase in NQO1 in total brain homogenates and soluble brain fractions. Enrichment of NQO1 in the insoluble proteome suggested that there could be pathologic aggregates of NQO1 in CTE brain. We therefore performed immunohistochemical analysis of CTE frontal cortex and identified multiple large NQO1 positive cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells as determined by dual immunofluorescence labeling. The number of NQO1 positive cells increased with higher stages of CTE pathology. These cells did not colocalize with beta-amyloid plaques, however, some NQO1 positive cells demonstrated colocalizing hyperphosphorylated tau immunoreactivity. We also assessed for the NQO1 C609T polymorphism as seen in previous Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies; however, the polymorphism was not enriched in the CTE group. Mechanistically, a global elevation in NQO1 may occur in response to increasing oxidative stress in neurodegeneration, however increasing insoluble and therefore dysfunctional or aggregated NQO1 may directly contribute to additional cellular injury. Since elevated NQO1 expression was previously reported in AD, future studies will be needed to further clarify how NQO1 contributes to disease pathogenesis in CTE, AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Ann Arbor, MI RNA decay is a crucial aspect of RNA metabolism that is regulated by a series of highly conserved physiological pathways. Our work directly implicates abnormalities in RNA decay as a primary mechanism of disease in the neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Both ALS and the most common subtype of FTLD (FTLD-TDP) share key molecular pathologic features, including cytoplasmic deposition of the RNA binding protein TDP43. TDP43 binds to and regulates thousands of RNA transcripts, and as a result, TDP43 deposition dramatically perturbs RNA metabolism. In healthy cells, TDP43 regulates itself by binding its own mRNA and triggering RNA decay through a pathway that requires the RNA helicase UPF1 (up frameshift 1). We previously demonstrated that UPF1 expression extends neuronal survival in models of ALS and FTLD-TDP. Rescue by UPF1 requires RNA decay, and expression of other RNA decay components also suppresses toxicity. We have now identified a set of transcripts that are destabilized by TDP43 using Bru-seq, a powerful RNA labeling and sequencing technique. TDP43 deposition consistently destabilized ribosome protein-encoding transcripts and those involved in mitochondrial function. Importantly, we detected a similar destabilization of these transcripts in cells from patients with familial ALS and FTLD-TDP43 due to C9orf72 mutations, the most prevalent mutation responsible for both conditions. Our data therefore suggest that TDP43 is a fundamental regulator of RNA stability. In addition, the accumulation of TDP43 in ALS and FTLD-TDP may trigger widespread transcript destabilization and consequent interruption of basic processes such as protein translation and energy metabolism, as evident in patient-derived cells.",

Our results suggest a need for psychometric analysis of this subdomain, including cultural and contextual adaptation of items. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT; also known as Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy; HMSN) is the name for inherited peripheral neuropathies that are not part of more complex syndromes. With an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2500 persons, CMT/HMSN is one of the most common neurogenetic diseases, and is subdivided according to clinical, electrophysiological, histological, and genetic features. CMT1/HMSN-I is a dominantly inherited demyelinating neuropathy, and is characterized by age of onset in first or second decade of life, nerve conduction velocities less than 38 m/s in upper limb nerves, and segmental demyelination and re-myelination with onion bulb formations in nerve biopsies. We performed whole exome sequencing on a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) and identified a de novo mutation in PMP2, the gene that encodes the myelin P2 protein. This mutation (p.Ile52Thr) was passed from the proband to his one affected son, and segregates with clinical and electrophysiological evidence of demyelinating neuropathy. We then screened a cohort of 136 European probands with uncharacterized genetic cause of CMT and identified another family with CMT1 that has a mutation affecting an adjacent amino acid (p.Thr51Pro) that segregates with disease. Our genetic and clinical findings in these kindred demonstrate that dominant PMP2 mutations are a new cause of CMT1.",

            "text": "Hande Ozdinler. Chicago, IL Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) emerge as one of the most complex neurodegenerative diseases with the involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons as well as non-neuronal cells, each playing an important role for disease pathology. Even though the relationship and the communication between motor neurons and the non-neuronal cells are beginning to emerge, the cellular and molecular basis of the perturbed balance that leads to enhanced motor neuron death is not well understood. Astrocytes and microglia are important for maintenance and proper health of motor neuron circuitry, but in cases of diseases the interaction between the non-neuronal cells and the motor neurons are perturbed either leading to neuronal vulnerability or enhancing the ongoing degeneration. Corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) are the key component of cortical component of the motor neuron circuitry that degenerate in ALS. We have evidence to show that their degeneration is an early event in ALS and that occur both due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The intrinsic factors are mediated via cellular events that are perturbed inside motor neurons that become vulnerable, and the extrinsic factors are mediated via non-neuronal cells that modulate innate immunity. One of the earliest events in vulnerable CSMN is the perturbation of ion influx and membrane potential, leading to an early hyperexcitation, and initiation of cascade of events that trigger many pathways that lead to neuronal vulnerability. At this time, the communication between CSMN and non-neuronal cells are also impaired and innate immunity is initiated much earlier than motor neuron death. As the neuron is trying to maintain its homeostasis, the non-neuronal cells already trigger \"death\" commend and the relationship between the motor neuron and the non-neuronal cell is changed forever. Since motor neuron fails to maintain homeostasis and the nonneuronal cells become more aggressive and less supportive, the neuronal degeneration is accelerated at a cellular level. Understanding the basis of this communication and interaction is key for building effective treatment strategies for ALS and other motor neuron diseases. In human trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), penetrance of systemically delivered neurotrophic factors (NTFs) into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited by the blood-brain barrier. A cell-based system for the delivery of molecular therapies from within the CNS could improve efficacy through locally-directed and sustained bioavailability. We have recently completed a Phase I, dose-escalation safety trial using autologous, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (adMSCs), injected into the intrathecal space by lumbar puncture in 27 patients with ALS. There was an excellent safety profile across a broad range of single and multiple doses. Our collaborative team is now using gene-editing technology to develop clinical-grade, genetically-modified autologous MSCs for use in ALS trials. The study objective is to modify human adMSCs by means of targeted gene-insertion into predefined 'safe-harbor' regions of the human genome using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) reagents. TALEN technology is readily adaptable to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Two candidate TALEN pair binding sites were identified for each of two safe harbor genomic loci, the AAVS1 (PPP1R12C) site on Chromosome 19 and the CLYBL site on Chromosome 9. Four pairs of TALEN plasmids were cloned. Human adMSCs were isolated from two normal control and two ALS patients. As adMSCs were resistant to chemical transformation, an electroporation protocol to efficiently deliver plasmid DNA to adMSCs was optimized. Cell viability, transformation efficiency, and TALEN pair cutting efficiency were measured 48 hours after electroporation. One TALEN pair at the AAVS1 locus was then selected on the basis of superior cutting efficiency, and was carried forward for detailed analysis of gene targeting and donor integration using a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) reporter fusion construct. Ongoing analyses include determining the efficiencies of on-target gene insertion versus off-target genomic modification, long-term rates of cell survival/apoptosis, and cell cycle disruption. Future directions will include developing cGMP protocols to establish the safety and reproducibility of high-throughput modified cell production. We anticipate that this technology will have broad applicability in a diverse range of neurologic conditions where direct delivery of agents into the CNS may improve the potential for therapeutic benefit.",

Here we identify the glycan unit ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P), a phosphoric ester of pentose alcohol, in a-DG. Rbo5P forms a tandem repeat and functions as a scaffold for the formation of the ligand-binding moiety. We show that enzyme activities of three major a-dystroglycanopathy-causing proteins are involved in the synthesis of tandem Rbo5P. Isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD) is cytidine diphosphate ribitol (CDP-Rbo) synthase. Fukutin and fukutin-related protein are sequentially acting Rbo5P transferases that use CDP-Rbo. Consequently, Rbo5P glycosylation is defective in adystroglycanopathy models. Supplementation of CDP-Rbo to ISPD-deficient cells restored a-DG glycosylation. These findings establish the molecular basis of mammalian Rbo5P glycosylation and provide insight into pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies in a-DG-associated diseases.",

It is important to determine the optimum timing of HSCT for cerebral ALD to accomplish a good outcome from HSCT. Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common acquired myopathy in Caucasians over age 50 and is typically distinguished from hereditary inclusion body myositis (hIBM) by later age of onset, lack of family history, characteristic pattern of weakness involving the quadriceps and finger flexors, and presence of autoinvasive endomysial inflammation on muscle biopsy. While the cause of sIBM is unknown, genetic susceptibility is thought to play a role based on the association of specific major histocompatibility complex haplotypes with sIBM. In addition, rare families with multiple members displaying an sIBM phenotype have also been described (termed familial IBM), although causative genes have not been determined. Here, we describe a large family with multiple members who developed an sIBM-like pattern of weakness in their 50's and who meet ENMC 2013 diagnostic criteria for sIBM. Multiple family members were found to have a pathogenic variant of valosin-containing protein (VCP) (R159C), however this did not fully segregate with disease. Whole exome sequencing revealed an additional novel variant in filamin C (FLNC) (F2616S) in multiple family members, and the combination of these two variants co-segregated with the sIBM phenotype. Mutations in VCP cause \"multisystem proteinopathy\" with IBM, Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia as common presenting features. The R159C mutation in particular has been associated with the broadest phenotypic spectrum, also including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and hereditary spastic paraparesis, although no members of this family developed evidence of cognitive dysfunction, motor neuron disease or movement disorder. FLNC mutations have been described in myofibrillar myopathy with clinical and pathological overlap with hIBM. We propose a digenic mode of inheritance in this family, wherein VCP R159C is necessary but not sufficient for weakness, and disease penetrance is increased by the additional presence of the FLNC F2616S variant.",

Nashville, TN Introduction: The overall goal of this work was to evaluate a novel quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) MRI protocol of the human sciatic nerve (SN) as a potential biomaterial in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. Current tools for assessing CMT diseases target distal nerves, which are often severely degenerated and, therefore, unavailable for evaluation. We previously developed a magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI protocol for detecting myelin content changes (from de/dysmyelination and/or axonal loss) in proximal nerves, which are partially preserved in CMT due its length dependent nature. Although MTR values related to impairment, they were also sensitive to hardware/experimental parameters, making multi-site longitudinal studies difficult. Quantitative MT (qMT) methods offer objective measures of myelin content with reduced sensitivity to these experimental factors at the cost of increased scan times and complexity. In this work, i) the feasibility of performing qMT in human SN was evaluated and ii) preliminary data were acquired in a cohort of patients with CMT.",

Historically, brain lesions were thought to be uncharacteristic of NMOSD, but the discovery of the highlyspecific antibody against aquaporin-4 associated with NMOSD has enabled clinicians and researchers to better characterize the disease, allowing for a broader spectrum that includes brain disease. Compared to MS and transverse myelitis (TM), the impacts of fatigue and depression on quality of life in NMOSD patients have been inadequately investigated and have yielded equivocal results. This study aims to better elucidate our understanding of the relationship that pain, disability, depression and fatigue have on quality of life in NMOSD patients compared to TM and MS.",

The patient also demonstrated intermittent rotatory nystagmus, diffuse hypertonia and hyperreflexia with ankle clonus. Continuous telemetry revealed multiple episodes of sinus bradycardia (34 beats-per-minute [bpm]) and second-degree atrioventricular block followed by sinus tachycardia (131bpm). Diagnostic evaluation revealed an elevated anti-NMDA antibody titer of 1:64 in the CSF and an ovarian teratoma on CT, which was surgically excised. On postoperative day one, the patient had recurrent episodes of asystole, the longest lasting 60 seconds requiring CPR and temporary pacemaker placement. She was treated with pulse dose intravenous corticosteroids and plasmapheresis with minimal improvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (2gm/ kg) was then given followed by rituximab. As the cardiac parameters appeared to have stabilized, the temporary pacemaker was removed. Within hours, the patient had a twominute episode of asystole that required resuscitation.

One hypothesis is that the NMDA receptors found in the nodose ganglion (which contains the cell bodies of vagal afferents) and the solitary nucleus (which contain their target neurons) may serve as targets for anti-NMDAR antibodies. NMDA receptors are also present in the insular cortex where they have been shown to modulate the baroreflex in unanesthetized rats. As NMDA antagonists have been shown to cause reflex bradycardia in these rats, it is possible that immune-mediated damage of these receptors via anti-NMDAR antibodies may have a similar effect.",

Additionally, they provide further support for the recently proposed theory of \"neural multifunctionality\", wherein language functions and non-linguistic cognitive functions are mutually dependent. ( Cognitive impairment is prevalent in HIV even among patients well treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) who have had sustained viral suppression. Brain vascular disease, possibly exacerbated by the HIV virus, chronic inflammation, and/or toxicity from cART, may contribute to cognitive impairment. Previous studies have focused on carotid disease and shown that carotid lesions accounted for as much variance in cognitive score as AIDs. However, data on the relationship between intracranial large vessel function as assessed by middle cerebral artery velocity (MCA-V) and brain structure in HIV are lacking. To obtain these data, women were recruited from the Brooklyn site of the Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS) as part of a study of vascular disease and cognition. Measures of white matter integrity, mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy [FA] were obtained from 3T MRIs and brain volumes were determined. MCA-V was measured with transcranial Doppler. The relationships between MCA-V and outcomes (quantitative MRI measures) were analyzed with partial correlation analyses controlling for intracranial volume, age, and history or presence of hypertension. A complete dataset was available on 40 age-matched women (26 HIVinfected and 16 HIV-uninfected). The mean age of the participants was 44.5 (SD 5 7.3) years. MCA-V was 64.6 (15.7) cm/sec and not associated with HIV-infection, hypertension, or age. MCA-V was associated with mean diffusivity (R 5 2.54, p 5 0.001), fractional anisotropy (R 5 0.33, p 5 0.04), and white matter hyperintensities (R 5 2.31, p 5 0.05). MCA-V was also associated with cortical volume (R 5 0.32, p 5 .04), subcortical volume (R 5 0.49, p 5 0.001), total gray volume (R 5 0.32, p 5 .03), but not the hippocampus (R 5 0.18, p 2 .28) or caudate (R 5 0.06, p 5 0.73). This study showed that MCA-V was associated with measures of white matter integrity and brain volume in women with HIV. However, it is not clear if these associations are simply due to neurovascular coupling or whether decreased MCA-V may have a causative role in brain degeneration. Longitudinal studies are needed to answer this question. Background: Accurate clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is important due to the differences in prognosis and management compared with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, because of considerable clinicopathologic overlap, the differential diagnosis between DLB and PD based on established clinical criteria is often difficult at early stages.",

Other Introduction: Robotic Assistant for MCI Patients at home (RAMCIP) is a three-year research project within the HORIZON2020 programme funded by the European Commission, (started in January 2015) with the aim of develop a novel robot that can provide assistance to elderly people with MCI and early AD. at their homes, allowing them to maintain an independent living and quality of life. Technical solutions are built based on the specific user requirements.

Background: Global neurology, which transcends national borders and prioritizes health equity for people worldwide, is a growing sub-specialty in neurology. This burgeoning field has been integrated into neurology programs nationwide, attracting physicians who want to understand the inner workings and challenges of low and middle income country health systems. The Weill Cornell Neurology Program has developed a new neurology exchange program with Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China that can be used as a template for other programs seeking to integrate global neurology into its training curriculum. Methods: Over a three week period, a Cornell neurology resident or fellow travels to Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China and participates in neurology rounds, clinic, as well as teaching of medical students at the university. This physician also spends one week learning in one of the rural hospitals in Jiangshan. The physician is required to give three presentations during the exchange, one of which is a clinical case presentation, the other of which is a research presentation, and a third on lessons learned from the elective. In exchange, a Zhejiang University resident or fellow travels to New York City to present analogous presentations and be engaged in neurologic clinical discussion and research at Weill Cornell. Two residents or fellows each year from each program are involved in this exchange.",

Studies of placebo acceptability have been performed in primary care and in higher risk clinical scenarios such as placebo surgery, but not in cluster headache.

Dr. Burke has received payments from Astra Zeneca and UCSF for case adjudication in the SOCRATES clinical trial. The ability to do informative, sensitive and accurate cognitive assessment in the clinical setting is important for a range of neurological diseases that have direct and indirect effects on the brain. Conventionally this has been limited by the time required, the cost involved and the need to send patients to remote locations for comprehensive neuropsychological testing. The present study was designed to measure cognitive function in individuals undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for major depressive disorder (MDD) using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA). The selection of ECT was chosen because of the known cognitive impairment associated with this treatment, and the availability of patients on whom longitudinal assessments could be performed. The MMSE has routinely been used to assess cognition for over 4 decades, while the DANA is a more recently developed battery of cognitive tests delivered on an electronic tablet. The 5 subtests of DANA included were the reaction time (RT), procedural reaction time (PRT), code substitution (CS), special processing (SP), and memory search (MS) tests. 17 subjects receiving inpatient ECT were tested using the MMSE and DANA an average of 7.5 times throughout their course of treatment (average length of stay 5 56 days). Correlations were observed between MMSE and performance on 3 of the 5 DANA subtests (P < 0.05). The MMSE only factors accuracy into the test score and has a ceiling of 30 possible points. The DANA factors both accuracy and time into performance analysis, eliminating a clear ceiling and allowing for improvements in cognition to be measured in individuals that would achieve the maximum score in the MMSE. Therefore, a second set of analyses were performed in which MMSE scores of 30 were removed to eliminate the ceiling effect. Correlations were observed between MMSE score and performance on all 5 DANA subtests (P < 0.05), indicating that the ceiling effect of the MMSE is a clear impediment to accurately measure cognition. DANA MS, PRT, and SRT test performance correlated to all MMSE scores and MMSE scores < 30, but significance levels improved in all cases when 30s were omitted. Taken together, these data suggest that the DANA is a more sensitive method of measuring cognition as compared to the MMSE. Background: Endocrine dysfunction, including thyroid function, has been known to cause cerebral vascular dysfunction. Hypothyroidism has been shown to cause mucopolysaccharide deposition which has been associated with the weakening of blood vessel walls and aneurysm formation in some case reports.

Needle EMG was performed, at each time-point, on muscles innervated by the femoral nerves bilaterally: sartorius, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis. Normal insertional activity was noted preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively in every tested muscle. One week postoperatively, borderline active denervation was only seen in the right sartorius and in the left rectus femoris.

Case report: A 64 year-old man presented with a fourweek history of bilateral distorted vision. He reported that objects in his central visual field appeared to change shape and were disproportionately large or small. He also noted altered color perception. His family noted intermittent confusion and difficulties recognizing family members. Examination revealed intact mental status, equal and reactive pupils, visual acuity of 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS, severe impairment of color vision, binocular central distortion of vertical lines on Amsler grid testing, left incongruous homonymous hemianopia, normal fundoscopic exam and otherwise normal neurological exam. Work-up revealed a negative toxicology screen, EEG with continuous 1-2 Hz generalized periodic discharges with occipital predominance and MRI brain with a cortical ribboning pattern of restricted diffusion involving the right occipital-parietal lobe. CSF analysis revealed normal protein and glucose, absent cells, negative paraneoplastic panel and cytology, positive 14-3-3 protein and elevated t-tau protein. He was diagnosed with 'probable' Heidenhain variant of sporadic CJD. He developed rapid cognitive decline and died shortly thereafter. An autopsy was performed which confirmed abnormal prion protein (PrP). Sequencing of the PrP gene did not reveal a pathogenic mutation.",

Reported causes include Ebstein Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, influenza, migraine, seizure, stroke and toxic encephalopathy. The symptoms are thought to localize to the nondominant posterior parietal and anterior occipital lobes. The Heidenhain variant of CJD is characterized by predominant visual symptoms, with mild to no cognitive symptoms early in the disease course, followed by a rapidly progressive course. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Identification of Mendelian genes associated with familial early onset AD have driven extensive and useful studies elucidating the mechanisms of those forms of AD. However, the majority of AD, even in patients with affected family members, is not explained by the presence of an autosomal dominantly inherited gene. We and others have reported an increased prevalence of late onset AD in those with affected first degree relatives underscoring the genetic contribution to AD incidence in the general population. Now, with next-generation sequencing and evolving bioinformatics tools, the complex genetic underpinnings of AD and related dementias can be systematically evaluated to identify frequency of known AD risk genes, novel candidate genes and candidate gene-gene interactions contributing to disease.",

Quetiapine has been reported to cause BMS, and may act to induce hyposmia and hypogeusia due to blockade of D2 receptors and serotonin receptors.

Other factors, which could play a role in the high prevalence of DNR utilization in whites and females needs to be explored in greater detail. Blood pressure (BP) variability is associated with the risk of cardiovascular events and target organ damages. However, there has been little information concerning BP variability in orthostatic hypotension (OH) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Herein, we measured 24h ambulatory BP and heart rates (HR) in patients with OH and POTS and normal controls (NC). A total of 71 patients were included: 21 OH; 17 POTS; 33 NC. The mean age of the patients was 48.6 years (standard deviation [SD], 18.2) and 62% were female. On an average, patients with POTS were younger than other groups (p < 0.001). Orthostatic intolerance symptom scores measured by questionnaires were 10.2 (SD, 6.0), which were not different among groups. Patients with OH had a higher awake SBP than patients with POTS (p 5 0.033), but there was no difference in the mean DBP. Regarding BP variability, the SD and coefficient of variation (CV) of sleep SBP were significantly higher in OH patients compared with POTS patients (p 5 0.014 and 0.035). BP variability of DBP did not differ between groups. In addition, the extent of morning BP surge, BP dipping during sleep as well as the difference between awake and sleep BP were not different significantly. Regarding HR variability, there was a marginal trend toward the higher CV of 24-h and awake HR in patients with OH (p 5 0.054 and 0.051). Among BP variability parameters, only the SD of 24-h DBP were significantly correlated with subjective symptom scores (q 5 0.234, p 5 0.05). Our findings indicated that patients with OH had increased BP variability especially during sleep compared to patients with POTS. Further study with larger populations is warranted.",

Introduction: Late onset cardiomyopathy with heart failure is the phenotype of familial amyloidosis, which occurs in African Americans (AA) in the United States at a rate 4 times that of whites after the age of 60 years. 3.9% of AA are heterozygous for the amyloidogenic allele where isoleucine substitutes for valine at position 122 (Val-122-ile) of the serum carrier protein transthyretin (TTR). We report on the observed neurologic changes in addition to the cardiomyopathy. Setting: Academic, tertiary care referral centers Methods: case series, retrospective review Results: Seven patients with the ATTR V122i gene mutation had amyloid staining on myocardial biopsies and one patient with amyloid staining on a flexor retinaculum biopsy. All had symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Causes of a peripheral neuropathy other than amyloid were excluded. All seven patients had axonal predominant progressive peripheral neuropathy, confirmed by NCV and EMG. One patient had a superimposed painful (narcotic requiring), lumbar radiculopathy, by EMG, without corresponding structural MRI abnormalities. One patient had multiple entrapment neuropathies (bilateral wrists and elbows), as well as, a prominent small fiber neuropathy documented by reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and autonomic nerve abnormalities with reduced sweat gland nerve fiber density.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Seven ATTR V122i patients who are known to have amyloid cardiomyopathy also have a peripheral neuropathy probably due to amyloid deposition in the nerve. We also describe a patient with the carpal tunnel syndrome and a progressive peripheral neuropathy without a cardiomyopathy with this mutation. In one patient, the symptoms of radiculopathy, confirmed by EMG, may be explained by dural amyloid infiltration. Further studies of this phenotype are warranted to confirm these findings and to determine incidence and prevalence of this potentially treatable and likely under recognized neuropathy. This case series expands our previous report of 6 patients1 and amplifies a recent description of a single patient. Objective: To report a novel case of clinical and electrophysiologically confirmed improvement of an inflammatory neuropathy with rivaroxaban. Background: Distal acquired demyelinating sensory motor neuropathy (DADS) neuropathy is a subtype of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The pathogenesis of the DADS variant of CIDP remains poorly understood, with both cellular immunity, involving CD81 Tcell activation, and humoral factors implicated. Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant that works as a direct factor Xa inhibitor, which has been shown to interfere with the pro-inflammatory actions of coagulant and fibrinolytic processes, leading to activation of proteinase-activated receptors and downregulation of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, and monocyte chemotactic protein. There is therefore interest in the role of Xa inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.",

SCS was indicated to the patient. Pulses of electrical stimulation were delivered to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord through an implanted 16channel, multi-program stimulation system. A 40% pain relieve was observed post-SCS treatment. However, pain levels increased after a traumatic event over the patient's right arm and scapula; therefore, an increase in medication doses and pulse intensity was needed. A year after, the patient was admitted to the emergency room with signs of opiates overdose secondary to recurrent pain crisis. These events were correlated to depletion of the SCS pulse generator battery, managed with surgical implantation of a rechargeable one. Further assessment of pain reported VAS of 7 with combined SCS and maximum doses of Methadone, Tramadol, and Venlafaxine.

Progressive visuospatial and visuoperceptual defects, including features of Balint syndrome (simultanagnosia and oculomotor apraxia), are prominent. Criteria compiled by Tang-Wai (Neurology, 2004) are widely used throughout the literature to guide diagnosis. A minority of patients with posterior cortical atrophy develop visual hallucinations (VH) during their progressive clinical course. There is unclear evidence for visual hallucinations intrinsic to PCA: previous reports describe such hallucinations as precedent to the development of Lewy Body Dementia (DLB). In these patients, VH emerge years after dementia presentation, and patients exhibit parkinsonian features. We describe an unusual case of posterior cortical atrophy in which visual hallucinations are the initial and predominant presenting symptom, predating the development of dementia by several years, and which notably lacks motor features of DLB.",

Within five weeks after beginning quetiapine, she developed persistent burning pain in the anterior tongue, continuous, all day, level of 7/ 10 in severity.

This increased over time to a burning sensation with all foods and ultimately became a burning in the anterior tongue and anterior palate independent of eating. Initially mild, this became more severe, 10/10 (especially at night) and is constant. It is aggravated with spicy foods, citrus, coffee, wine, beer, and foods with high texture.

Quetiapine may act to inhibit the taste, and taste inhibited pain, this induces disinhibition of pain. It may cause inhibition of large vibratory A fibers causing C-fiber (pain) disinhibition. The patient may be suffering from misattribution syndrome: the pain existed before but is inappropriately ascribed to quetiapine. The BMS may have existed prior to the quetiapine but underlying depression may have lessened, so they may now be energized and have enough selfconfidence to complain about the pain, as opposed to suffering silently with it. Quetiapine's anticholinergic properties may cause mouth dryness and this can secondarily predispose them to BMS.

Hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is characterized by TTR amyloid deposits in various tissue sites and organs such as peripheral nerves, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, eyes, and leptomeningeal tissues of the brain. So far, more than 130 mutations in the TTR gene have been found. Here, we report a Japanese late onset case with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), caused by a novel TTR mutation TTR (Lys80Arg), who shows orthostatic hypotension, electric shock like pain and allodynia in the trunk and severe pre/post micturitional pain with mild neuropathy and cardiopathy without vitreous opacity. Immunehistochemistry and serum-mass spectrometry showed that the amyloid fibrils were composed of TTR, in conjunction with a typical FAP phenotype. His younger brother developed mild polyneuropathy without micturitional pain, who had a novel compound heterozygous TTR Val30Met/ Lys80Arg mutation. These results indicate that that the novel TTR mutation (Lys80Arg) is the cause of amyloidosis and symptoms of micturitional abdominal pain. However, a novel compound heterozygous TTR Val30Met/Lys80Arg mutation may cause mild and late-onset of systemic amyloidosis.",

Sakai, Osaka, Japan and Osakasayama, Osaka, Japan Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) seemed unrelated with genetic factors, except for 5-10% of familial cases. However, recent reports demonstrate that 11% of patients with sporadic ALS (SALS) have genetic mutations. Genetic counseling is complicated for patients and families to accept unwilling genetic results in sporadic cases. It is especially difficult, when the mutations are novel because their pathogenicity remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed genes known to be causative for ALS in 94 Japanese patients with SALS. We report representative cases of genetic counseling for mutation-positive families. We found nine mutations including four novel mutations (SOD1, VCP [p.R487H], p62 [p.A53T and p.P439L]). In contrast to the results in the Western countries, no mutations were identified in the C9ORF72 gene. We tested the pathogenicity of the identified novel mutations using fibroblasts of the patients and neuronal cells expressing mutants. The patients' cells or cells expressing mutant proteins were susceptible to oxidative stress generated by hydrogen peroxide or l-buthionine sulfoximine, which inhibits synthesis of glutathione, a freeradical scavenger. Genetic counseling was requested by four families but was declined by one, and others were not followed up. Even though cellular toxicity of the mutants was observed, we provided highly inconclusive information on counseling, where patients and families only partly understood the situations. In conclusion, we should perform genetic analyses on SALS to clarify its phathomechanism, but consider and overcome many difficulties on counseling.",

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated albumincytological dissociation and nerve conduction studies showed an axonal demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, which confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. She received a fiveday treatment course with plasmapheresis, which resulted in modest improvement of the lower extremities weakness. A repeat MRI showed marked improvement in vasogenic edema compared to the previous study and MRA revealed resolution of previously visualized vasculopathy.

As such, biompedance has shown promising utility in a field where other more traditional objective parameters have failed to demonstrate significant usefulness.2 For these reasons, the specifics of the testing itself as well as the reliability of the data it generates are of substantial import and are thus the target of increasingly closer inspection.

This estimation has been hypothesized by many to be reliable. 4 Other methods have used focal bioimpedance. This process focuses on a specific muscle (i.e., quadriceps femoris) and the tissues' overall resistance and reactance across this isolated muscle group.5 These two modalities require completely different equipment and techniques. We attempt to show the dangers of some of the assumptions required to employ total body bioimpedance, and we consequently demonstrate and advocate for the superiority of focal muscle testing.

Objective: To postulate the neuroanatomical localization and connections of complex visual hallucinations in RPLS Case report: A fifty-nine years old lady, with history of adrenal insufficiency, hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, on Citalopram, thyroid hormonal therapy and Infliximab, presented with three-day history of sudden bilateral blindness, with only notable exam finding of hypertension and mild optic ataxia. MRI brain revealed bilateral occipital T2 hyper-intensities, without restricted diffusion, suggesting vasogenic edema. Routine laboratory studies (including cerebrospinal fluid) were normal, except for hypomagnesemia. Urine drug screen revealed benzodiazepine exposure. She was diagnosed and treated as possible RPLS. 2 days later, she developed acute psychosis with well-formed visual hallucinations (of deceased relatives) with severe agitation and combativeness, refractory to lorazepam and haloperidol. Prolonged QT interval limited aggressive antipsychotic medication use. Patient was transferred to the Neuro-Critical care unit with dexmedetomidine and nicardipine infusions for optimal blood pressure control. Despite absence of clinical seizures, her electroencephalogram demonstrated frequent epileptiform discharges in bilateral occipital areas that attenuated with phenytoin, along with clinical improvement in mental state, and slow and almost complete recovery in her vision. Repeat MRI, on day 10, showed resolving occipital hyper-intensities.",

Less commonly, they may be associated with dysfunction of the ascending brainstem cholinergic pathway. Charles Bonnett syndrome (CBS), with complex visual hallucinations and ocular blindness, is well described. Its association with cortical blindness has also been reported, but such patients usually retain normal cognition and insight. Our case report highlights the complex interaction of different neurobiological factors, such as, cortical blindness, structural brain lesion and epileptiform brain activity in the pathophysiology of this unique syndrome. Occipital lesions, are typically associated with unformed visual symptoms. In our patient, occipital epileptiform discharges, bilateral occipital vasogenic edema, with symptom resolution after phenytoin use along with resolution of vasogenic edema over time strongly corroborates our case of RPLS with its unusual presentation as CBS. This is suggestive of non-convulsive non-striate occipital cortex seizures as another possible pathophysiological mechanism for generation of complex visual hallucinations.

            "text": "Discussion: The mechanism whereby the alliaceous foods amplify the pain in BMS is unclear. Manducating alliaceous foods creates olfactory and trigeminal stimulation through retronasal pathways. The sulfhydryl groups in these compounds are trigeminally activating, stimulating TRPA1 receptors in the trigeminal nerve (Bautista 2005 , Bautista 2006 ). This functions to provoke calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P release (Bautista 2005, Kunkler 2011). This causes parasympathetic nervous system discharge in the semilunar ganglion, with associated neurogenic inflammation and nociceptive discharge. The odorant component may induce change in emotion which then induces enhanced pain (Ehrlichman 1988). Moreover, it may act to evoke olfactory or gustatory nostalgia, thereby inducing negative mood changes which would further predispose to exacerbation of pain. Alternatively, the alliaceous compounds may have functioned on the tongue itself, with the sulfhydryl groups causing discharge of the small C nociceptor in a manner similar to irritant compounds, analogous to capsaicin, thus directly inducing pain. Moreover, these compounds may have acted immunologically to cause local tongue allergenic response (histamine-mediated via degranulation of mast cells) causing a positive neuroinflammatory feedback loop and allodynia, with associated exacerbation of any underlying stomatitis and pain. Query as to alliaceous precipitants of BMS is warranted.",

Orange, CA Late onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme acid alphaglucosidase (GAA), presents with diaphragm and skeletal muscle weakness with little or no cardiac involvement. The disease is progressive, and if left untreated, may result in significant motor disability and respiratory failure. Pompe disease is now considered treatable, with FDA-approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) LumizymeV R . Initial published data in LOPD showed improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) and endurance, measured by 6-minute walk. However, subsequent publications have shown plateauing of this benefit and worsening of FVC may occur with time. In infantile cases of Pompe disease, development of IgG antibodies against GAA results in reduced treatment efficacy, especially in cross-reactive immunologic material negative (CRIM-) individuals. The role of these antibodies in neutralizing effects of treatment in LOPD is not clear since most individuals at this stage are CRIM1. We plan to present a retrospective analysis of our 9 patients who regularly follow with us, have been on uninterrupted enzyme replacement therapy and have been checked for these antibodies on a routine basis. We intend to correlate their treatment related adverse events, their treatment response, as measured by muscle function tests (manual muscle strength, 6-minute walk test), respiratory function trends (serial FVC, maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP) and sniff nasal inspiratory pressures (SNIP)), and quality of life data with the antibody titers. Furthermore we will correlate these data with their genotype results, and when available, pretreatment GAA enzyme levels and urinary Hex4 results. Our hypothesis is that development of anti-GAA antibody titers has no effects on treatment efficacy in LOPD.",

Baltimore, MD and Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in people under 45 years old in developing countries. A large number of patients with TBI are admitted to intensive care units; however, outcomes after one year are difficult to anticipate during the acute period.

The patients with lower GCS on admission or day six, significantly had lower GOSE. Moreover, the lower the GCS in the first week of admission, the poorer the final outcome. Among laboratory data, the base deficit (BD) level of 26 or worse on admission was an indicator of mortality at one year.

            "text": "Calpains are calcium-dependent cysteine proteases playing key physiological and pathological roles in the central nervous system (CNS). Two major calpain isoforms in the CNS are calpain-1 and calpain-2. Recent studies in our laboratory have indicated that calpain-1 is neuroprotective while calpain-2 is neurodegenerative. Furthermore, calpain-1 activation is required for the induction of long term potentiation (LTP), while calpain-2 activation during the consolidation period restricts the amplitude of LTP. This study was therefore directed at identifying cysteine protease inhibitors, which would be selective for calpain-2. Because the phosphatase PTEN is a selective calpain-2 substrate, we generated peptides based on the sequences surrounding two putative calpain-cleavage sites to provide a template for a calpain-2 selective inhibitor. We first co-expressed calpain-2 large subunit and calpain-4, the small calpain subunit common to both calpain-1 and calpain-2, in E-coli and used NI-NTA column to purify the calpain-2/calpain-4 complex. Calpain-2 activity was measured using an in vitro calpain activity assay. We tested 14 potential calpain-2 selective inhibitors, which are peptides with the sequence of the spectrin cleavage site or putative PTEN cleavage sites and compared their inhibitory activity to that of a known calpain-2 inhibitor. We further tested the inhibitors in a PTEN cleavage assay using mouse brain homogenates. Our results indicate that the peptide sequence of the spectrin cleavage site has a higher inhibitory activity for calpain-2 than for calpain-1, an effect which was further confirmed by the PTEN cleavage assay. Further studies are needed to generate an even more selective calpain-2 inhibitor, which would have potential therapeutic applications in disorders associated with neurodegeneration such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).",

In this model, the physiologic synesthesia of retronasal smell was initially predominant and inhibited the pathological synesthesia. As smell adapted, the salty dysgeusia prevailed. This may represent a dual diagnosis of 1-olfactory dysfunction with rapid adaptation and 2-taste distortion. Thus, this could be the chemosensory analogue to the double crush phenomenon in peripheral nerve disease, wherein two lesions are needed for symptoms to occur.

Baltimore, MD; Cali, Colombia and Baltimore As the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic spreads in the Americas, understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between ZIKV and neurological diseases becomes an urgent public health concern, with need for in-vitro models which recapitulate the mechanisms of disease in the human nervous system. We developed an iPSC-derived 3D mini-brain model that consist of human neuronal and glial cell populations including GABAergic, glutaminergic and dopaminergic neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We have shown efficient maturation of the iPSC and characterized the cell phenotype by using immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry. These minibrains have spontaneous electrical activity and exhibit myelination of axons. Here, we show that Guillian-Barre syndrome and microcephaly derived ZIKV strains are able to produce infection in the iPSC-3D minibrain model. The infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and electron microscopy. Infected minibrains released infectious ZIKV particles after ZIKV was washed out. Immunofluorescence identified ZIKV particles in the cytoplasm of astrocytes and neurons in the model with increased cell death noted as compared with the controls. Our findings establish an experimental model to study the mechanisms of ZIKV associated neurological disease and explore therapeutic compounds. The effect of obesity on different vascular territories of the body is varied. The aim of the study was to evaluate obesity as an independent predictor of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data collected by 2013 Behavioral Risk factor Surveillance System was analyzed through multivariate binary logistic regression (n5348,027). 11.34% of the obese suffered from CVD and 4.97% suffered from stroke. Age, ethnicity, smoking status, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol intake, physical activity, diabetes mellitus and weight status were found to be strong predictors of both CVD and stroke. With increasing age, the likelihood of stroke and CVD increased. While females had higher odds of stroke, males had CVD. Race and ethnicity had varying effects. Behaviorally, individuals who smoke currently or were former smokers experienced greater risk of CVD and stroke. Alcohol and physical activity were protective. Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia increased the odds of CVD and stroke. Obesity was directly related to stroke (OR51.671) and CVD (OR51.736). The current study suggests that risk of both CVD and stroke is high and comparable in the obese. Hence, it is important to educate adults about stroke as a complication of obesity.",

It is a polyetiological disease with its risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, alcohol, and past history of stroke. Periodontal disease and cerebrovascular disease share common risk factors.

We report a 26-year-old male with a four-year history of partial epilepsy following a significant traumatic brain injury from a motorbike accident. During the video-EEG evaluation, he had five sequential stages of status epilepticus that lasted 67 minutes and terminated with hypoventilation and asystole. Conventional scalp EEG recording and lead I-EKG were analyzed using Kubios HRV software version 2.1. We found that with the onset of SE and early stages (Stage I and II), there was marked activation of both systems of the ANS with sympathetic overdrive. In the late stages of SE (Stage IV and V), there was a progressive increase in parasympathetic activity leading to hypoventilation and ictal asystole. The case highlights the dynamic changes in sympathovagal imbalances with sympathetic predominance in the early stages and parasympathetic predominance in the late stages of SE.",

While PNES patients are known to have psychological dysfunction, little is known about their mood and anxiety symptoms immediately post-ictally. We hypothesize that if the seizures in PNES patients are a physical manifestation of their coping mechanisms, they should show an improvement in their mood and anxiety in the hours following a seizure. Patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventories (BAI) in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at baseline and after seizures. Seizures were characterized as epileptic or psychogenic nonepileptic. The preliminary data show that there is a change from baseline toward improvement of mood in the 24-hour post-ictal period and that there is a tendency to return to baseline 2 weeks following the seizure. BDI-II showed a decrease in depression scores compared to baseline after 1-4 hours (21.1,-3.3), 12 hours (23.1,-6.3), and 24 hours (21.8,-5.2). Average anxiety scores on the BAI decreased at 1-4 hours (23.6), 12 hours (26.9), 24 hours (25) The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of neurological complications and deaths associated with epidural injection and compared incidence between steroid and nonsteroid injections. We used the Health Insurance Record Review & Assessment Service database from 2009 to 2013 to make a retrospective cohort. We excluded patients who were treated under ICD-10 codes of neurological complications or who had spine operation before 2010. We estimated incidence and hazard ratios in propensity score matched cohort using Charlson comorbidity index, age and gender. We identified complications in patients who were admitted to the hospital within 24 hours after an epidural injection at outpatient clinics and were treated under ICD-10 codes of neurological complications during admission or death at discharge. Incidence rate per 100,000 person-days for epidural steroid injection (1.38, 95% CI 1.14-1.70) was higher than one for epidural injection without steroid (0.75, 95% CI 0.36-0.94). Incidence of particulate steroid injection (1.52, 95% CI 1.20-1.81) was higher than one for non-particulate steroid injection (0.84, 95% CI 0.38-0.95). In conclusion, epidural steroid injection is dangerous than epidural injection without steroid, mainly due to particulate steroid. Neuroimaging abnormalities in the amygdala have previously been described in headache patients. However, it remains unclear how these abnormalities relate to behavior. This study aimed to assess amygdala volume in chronic daily headache (CDH) patients and determine behavioral variables predictive of these abnormalities. 68 participants (34 patients and 34 sex-and age cohortmatched healthy controls) were included. MRI (3T GE system) scans included high-resolution T1-weighted scans. Behavioral questionnaires included Patient Health Questionnaires 9 and 15, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, Primary-Care Post-Traumatic Stress Screen, and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. A region of interest based voxel-based morphometry analysis examined amygdala volume and step-wise multiple regression analyses assessed predictive values of behavioral data on amygdala volume.",

Total costs of MG inpatient care rose 13-fold from 2003 to 2013, however, MS and all inpatient costs doubled. Increases in MG costs were accounted for by an over 6-fold increase in the number of discharges and a 2-fold increase in cost per discharge. In contrast, MS discharges remained stable and total discharges dropped, while cost per discharge demonstrated similar increases. For MG, the under 17 and over 85 age groups experienced the greatest increase in discharges. Use of private insurance decreased while Medicare and Medicaid use increased. Regional variations in cost for MG were also apparent with greater rises in costs in the Midwestern and Southern U.S., disproportionate to MS and all hospital discharges.

Surface righting timing and tactics, swimming speed and posture, and pre-swimming behavior were measured. After landing, flight rats from both missions had significantly fewer mature righting tactics, but also started swimming sooner, than control rats. While the effects on righting persisted, the differences in swimming speed and posture resolved by ten days after landing.

Patients wear a personal health monitoring device with an associated Android/IOS app collecting data on motor activity, voice and pulmonary function. iPS motor-neurons derived from each patient undergo whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipomics and high content imaging. Clinical and biological signatures are generated using bioinformatics and computational biology. The data is open source and online downloadable without IP restrictions. The goal of this effort will be to 1) identify true biological subsets of ALS which will inform future clinical trials, help develop therapies targeting the proper moleculare pathway for the right patient subgroup, provide a platform of human patient derived authentic neurons for use in patient subgroup drug discovery and appropriate biomarker for use in clinical trials. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying slow oscillations during anesthesia and sleep remain poorly understood. We have utilized transgenic mice genetically encoded to express calcium indicators in cortical neurons (GCaMP) to monitor neuronal activity in living mice. We report the neural correlates of ketamine anesthesia sedation and compare them to wakefulness.",

While the occurrence of these conditions has been studied in the postictal and inter-ictal periods, little is understood about mood changes in the peri-ictal period. We hypothesize that patients with baseline depressive moods will show improvements in mood in the peri-ictal period. We also hypothesize that patients with focal onset seizures are more likely to have mood improvements in the peri-ictal period than those with generalized onset seizures.",

Our data show that epileptic patients show improvement in both mood and anxiety postictally.

Seattle, WA Background: Chronic migraine and tension-type headache are common in childhood and can be associated with significant disability and distress. Although psychosocial treatments are effective for youth with headache, given scarce resources available, screening of families most in need of treatment is desirable. In other chronic conditions, the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT; Kazak et al., 2012) has been well-validated and effectively implemented in clinical practice to identify family psychosocial risk. The purpose of this study is to apply this psychosocial screening approach to pediatric headache by validating a new headache version of the PAT (PAT-HA).",

Background: It is challenging to diagnose MCI since patients' cognitive deficits are mild, cerebral atrophic changes are subtle and there are not efficient biomarkers. In the clinical trial of MCI such as anti-amyloid therapies, the screen failure rate is high because there are strict inclusion/ exclusion criteria and some patients reveal having no accumulation of amyloid beta in the PET study or lumber puncture. Recently \"serum MCI screening test\" are commercially available in Japan (not covered by health insurance) (MCBI inc. Japan). This test evaluate the risk to develop MCI which measure serum transthyretin (TTR), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and complement 3(C3), then add the score of MMSE, and statistically calculate the cut-off and categorize the risk: A (healthy",

When compared to only other seropositive AE patients, anti-NMDAR patient metabolism was diminished in the bilateral visual cortices (seropositive AE right Z5 22.2, P<0.01; left Z5 22.1, P< 0.01) as well as the occipital cortices (right anti-NMDAR Z5 23.3, seropositive AE Z5 21.9, P50.02; left anti-NMDAR Z5 23.5, seropositive AE Z5 22.0, P50.07). When comparing anti-NMDAR patients to the sample of control patients, the right frontal (anti-NMDAR Z5 22.6, control Z5 20.7, P50.02) and the bilateral visual cortices and occipital lobes were hypometabolic (control right visual Z5 20.2, P50.02; left visual Z5 20.4, P50.02; right occipital Z5 0.0, P50.02; left occipital Z5 0.3, P50.02). One anti-NMDAR patient underwent subsequent FDG-PET/CT three and six months after the initial scan, with normalization of visual cortex metabolism correlating with clinical recovery. Conclusions: Marked visual cortex hypometabolism by FDG-PET/CT may serve as an early biomarker for discriminating anti-NMDAR encephalitis from other causes of AE. Resolution of visual cortex hypometabolism may correlate with clinical improvement in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. M204.

Independent prognostic factors for OS include age (HR for age<18 vs. age>18: 0.450-0.912), prior treatment (HR for no vs. yes: 0.127-0.350), WHO grade (HR low vs. high grade: 0.085-0.219), and EOR (HR for GTR vs. STR: 0.311-0.831). Conclusion: In patients with spinal astrocytoma, WHO grade and extent of surgical resection were significant prognostic factors for both PFS and OS. Age>18 years and prior treatment were negative predictors of OS. S156. MR Imaging Features Predict Survival and Molecular Profile in Diffuse Lower Grade Gliomas Hao Zhou, Harrison X.

Patients self-reported home addresses were recorded on arrival to the ED as part of their routine medical care, and addresses in MA were geocoded using the United States Census Geocoder (geocoding.geo.census.gov) matched to the 2010 Census data. Mapping and spatial analysis was performed with the open source geographic information system (GIS) software QIGS (www.qgis.org). Out of 313,085 total visits to the ED, we identified 3,261 visits for known or potential iCVA, including 2,780 visits from home addresses in MA. Of these, 2,401 were successfully geocoded to census level. iCVA patients were significantly older and more likely to be male than patients visiting MGH for other reasons. At the ZIP code level, iCVA visits generally originated from the north-east of MGH, likely reflecting the presence of other stroke center hospitals to the south-west of MGH. Using GIS based Jenks clustering analysis, we identified 12 census tracts with the highest number of iCVA visits, four of which remained important after adjusting for census tract population. These four census tracts represent hot spots of iCVA visits to MGH, and could be used for further research on community level iCVA risk and/or for targeting future iCVA education campaigns.S287.

Tongue click which is actually higher in limb onset patients declines faster by 1.5 [22.0 to 20.9 (95%CI)] units compared with bulbar onset patients 20.3 [21.6 to 0.0 (95%CI)] units in 12 months. Change in tongue click correlated significantly with change in tongue strength [r50.8324; p50.005] over 12 months. Change in ALS FRS Bulbar subscore correlated significantly with change in platysma strength [r50.5933; p50.006] . Conclusions: The natural history of orofacial muscle strength measured clinically correlates with ALS FRS-R Bulbar subscale and other measurements offering a novel set of new clinimetrics to assess new treatment regimens in the bulbar domain.

Background: In Oct 2011, NINDS awarded the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) grant to MGH, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) grant to the University of Iowa, and Clinical Study Sites (CSS) grants to 25 academic institutions, with a goal of conducting 5 to 7 phase 2 studies in neurological disorders over 7 years. Each CSS executed a Reliance Agreement with a Central IRB (CIRB) and a Master Clinical Trial Agreement (MCTA) with the CCC. The CCC and DCC work with investigators to develop study design and prepare grant applications. Grants undergo peer review at NINDS. Once funded, CCC and DCC work to operationalize the study: select sites, train investigators, distribute drug and supplies, regulatory compliance, create study database, and implement statistical analyses.",

Studies examining the relationship between pre-stroke MDD and DNR utilization are largely lacking.Methods: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) from years 2011-2012. We identified AHS and MDD as a primary and secondary diagnosis respectively using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, and Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. We defined DNR status with ICD code V49.86 entered during the same admission as a secondary diagnosis and estimated severity of illness by the 3M TM All Patient Refined DRG (APR DRG) Classification System. A hierarchical two level multivariate regression model was generated to estimate odds ratios (aOR) to estimate the independent effect of MDD on DNR utilization.Results: We analyzed 142,519 patients with ICH out of which 12,523 (8.8%) had MDD. Proportion of DNR utilization was 15.5% vs. 16.9% (p<0.01) among MDD patients from 2002 to 2012. The median age of patients who had DNR utilization were similar in MDD and without MDD (80 vs 79, p:0.10). However hospitalizations",

In February 2016, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) reported the first case of GBS with ZIKV infection, and ZIKV-associated GBS is expected to increase given ongoing local transmission. To address this, the PRDH, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the University of Puerto Rico, has implemented a prospective epidemiologic and surveillance study to monitor the frequency of cases of GBS, and to identify and characterize cases associated with ZIKV. From January through June 2016, 36 confirmed or suspected cases of GBS have been identified. ZIKV infection was identified in 19 (53%) of the 36 cases. Patients with ZIKV-associated GBS were 21 to 82 years old (median, 55 years) and 13 (68%) were female. Electrodiagnostic studies showed axonal and demyelinating subtypes of GBS. Our findings support the notion that ZIKV infection can be associated with GBS and these can be of different subtypes. HSAN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations to serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase. The mutations induce a permanent shift in the substrate preference from serine to alanine thereby forming a class of neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids. We report on a two-year, delayedstart placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral L-serine (400 mg/kg/d) in HSAN1. Eighteen HSAN1 patients with prominent sensory loss, limb ulcers and neuropathic pain were enrolled. Subjects were equally randomized to L-serine or placebo for 1 year. At 48-weeks, participants remained on or crossed-over to L-serine for one additional year. Sixteen subjects completed their 96-week visit. No serious adverse events related to Lserine were reported. Over the first year plasma deoxysphinganine declined by 59% among participants randomized to L-serine vs. a 9% increase among placebo participants (p < 0.001). At 1 year, participants randomized to L-serine experienced a significant decline in CMT Neuropathy Scores relative to placebo (21.8 units, 95% CI 23.3 to 20.3, p 5 0.02). Both groups improved in the second year. We conclude that L-serine is a safe and potentially efficacious treatment option for patients with HSAN1.",
