Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis confirmed that the fiber is expressed as a 102 kDa glycoprotein, which is localized to the nucleus of infected cells. To identify the nuclear localization signals (NLS), BAdV-3 fiber deletion mutants and GFP/\u03b2-galactosidase fusion proteins were expressed in transfected cells, and subcellular localization was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Analysis of deletion mutants localized the NLS to the N-terminal 41 amino acids. Analysis of the N-terminal 41 amino acids identified a cluster of basic residues between amino acid 14 and 20. Substitution of the basic residues ( 16 KAKR 19 ) with acidic residues ( 16 EAEE 19 ) resulted in the accumulation of fiber in the cytoplasm. However, 16 KAKR 19 or 12 VYPYKAKRPNI 22 were not sufficient for efficient transport of a cytoplasmic protein GFP/\u03b2-galactosidase to the nucleus.",

The cells were fixed in methanol at \u221220 \u2022 C for 20 min and blocked with 2% normal goat serum for 15 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Similarly, the MDBK cells were infected with wild-type or mutant BAdV-3 at different MOIs. At different times post-infection, the infected cells were fixed in methanol at \u221220 \u2022 C for 20 min and blocked with 2% normal goat serum for 15 min at room temperature. The subcellular location of fiber proteins was determined by staining with appropriate rabbit anti-BAdV-3 fiber polyclonal antibodies for one hour followed by incubation with the Fab fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Jackson Immuno Research). Finally, the samples were viewed with a fluorescence microscope and representative photographs were taken with Tmax 100 film (Kodak).",

Although fiber is a structural component of all adenoviruses examined so far, the structure and the nature of cell surface receptors recognized by fiber differs amongst different adenoviruses suggesting that fiber is the major determinant of host cell tropism. The L7 mRNA of BAdV-3 has the potential to code for fiber protein of 976 amino acids in length. Antisera directed against the fiber protein immunoprecipitated two glycoproteins of 62 kDa and 102 kDa from BAdV-3 infected cells but not from mock infected cells. However, Western blot analysis suggested that fiber protein is expressed as a 102 kDa protein in BAdV-3 infected cells. Moreover, the 62 kDa protein is not a precursor and/or cleavage product of 102 kDa protein, but a co-immunoprecipitating protein (penton base protein; unpublished data). Like HAdV-2 [7] , the BAdV-3 fiber protein is detected predominantly in the nucleus and contains epitopes in the knob domain for the production of neutralizing antibodies against BAdV-3.",

Therefore, it is very unlikely that BAdV-3 fiber protein enters the nucleus by a simple diffusion mechanism due to its large molecular mass (102 kDa). Furthermore, if diffusion accounts for subcellular location of the fiber, one would expect the protein to be equally distributed throughout the cell rather than accumulating predominantly in the nucleus. Although the presence of a non-conventional motif can lead to nuclear import of a protein [15] , numerous studies have demonstrated that active import of large proteins to the nucleus requires a distinct amino acid sequence known as NLS [4] . The ability of BAdV-3 fiber to localize to the nucleus in the absence of other viral proteins indicated that the NLS(s) may be present within the protein.",

Substitution of the basic residues (KKR) with acidic residues (EEE) was sufficient to abolish translocation of fiber to the nucleus in transfected cells suggesting that KKR residues are essential for targeting of fiber to the nucleus. Surprisingly, 16 KAKR 19 or 12 VYPYKAKRPNI 22 motifs were not able to direct predominantly cytoplasmic GFP/\u03b2-galactosidase fusion protein efficiently to the nucleus. It is possible that other sequences may be required for efficient nuclear transport of fusion protein. Alternatively, it is possible that the capacity of the NLS of BAdV-3 fiber protein for nuclear translocation may depend on the protein to which it is linked or the context of the NLS within the fusion protein. For example, the NLS of GAL4, a yeast DNA-binding protein, functions efficiently when fused to normally cytoplasmic invertase, but not when fused to E. coli \u03b2-gal [13] . Moreover, an NLS inserted into several sites within the polypeptide chain of pyruvate kinase could not function in some locations, as its activity was masked [19] .",

However, although recombinant BAV302EAEE expressing mutant fiber protein was isolated, the virus yield was reduced by 3 logs compared to BAV302, suggesting that the sequence encoding NLS is required for optimum viral growth. Efficient HAdV-5 particle formation occurs in the absence of fiber, however the infectivity of such fiberless viruses is severely reduced [8] . Analysis by electron microscopy revealed no significant differences in the formation of virus particles in wild-type BAdV-3 or BAV302EAEEinfected cells. It is possible that the defective growth of BAV302EAEE results directly from the reduced level of nuclear localized fiber, which may affect the efficiency of the formation of infectious virus particles. Alternatively, the defective transport of fiber in BAV302EAEE-infected cells may alter other viral functions, which may in turn affect the efficiency of formation of infectious virus particles.",
