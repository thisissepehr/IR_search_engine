We often calculate the proportion of time spent eating different foods (e.g., fruits, leaves) to place species into dietary categories and contrast morphological or behavioral traits among categories. Yet we have little understanding of how flexible species can be in terms of the plant parts and species consumed. To address this issue, we analyzed data on the diets of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) from Kibale National Park, Uganda, to evaluate temporal and spatial variability in the plant parts and species eaten. After considering observer differences and sampling issues, we evaluated how different a group's diet could be if samples were taken in different years. We found that the diet of the same groups showed significant, consistent changes over a 4-year period. For example, the time spent feeding on leaves increased from 56% in 1994 to 76% in 1998. The plant parts and species eaten by eight groups inhabiting different types of forest (e.g., pristine, logged, riverine) varied among groups. The largest interdemic difference was seen in the use of young leaves (38%). Dietary differences were also found between groups with overlapping home ranges (41-49% overlap). Different subspecies of Procolobus badius also varied in diet; however, this variation was often not of the magnitude documented within Kibale for the same population. The fact that diet can vary considerably over small spatial and short temporal scales within the same species raises the intriguing question as to what level of interspecific difference is biologically significant for addressing particular questions. We conclude that behavioral flexibility blurs our traditional stereotypic assessment of primates; a study of one group that occupies a specific habitat at one point in time may not adequately represent the species.

With primates, such studies have typically involved interspecific contrasts of groups that occupy different areas or groups of different species studied at different times (Struhsaker and Oates, 1975; Struhsaker, 1978; Waser, 1987) . Such contrasts assume that spatial and temporal variation in diet is minimal or at least much less than interspecific variation. Data from Kibale suggest that this may not be the case. Struhsaker and Oates (1975) quantified the dietary overlap between black-andwhite and red colobus studied at similar times, but in neighboring areas. They concluded that these two species do not compete because dietary overlap is low. Considering the data that have accumulated since Struhsaker and Oates (1975) and the data presented here, it may be valuable to reassess this interpretation. We studied groups of these species occupying the same area, which reduces variation in the forest structure and phenology experienced by the study animals. We found a 43% overlap in the diet of these two sympatric species. Whether or not this is a \"biologically significant\" dietary overlap is open to question. Groups were not followed on exactly the same day, and they were typically not using the exact same area. The two neighboring groups of red colobus that we observed had an average home-range overlap of 44%, and these groups had an average monthly dietary overlap of 37%. These examples illustrate that consideration of interspecific interactions and dietary overlap must be made in light of spatial and temporal variation in diet, and should reflect the fact that our categorization of a group's diet represents a sample of the animal's true behavior (for a similar comparison of two sympatric colobines, see Bocian, 1997) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 358, "text": "(Struhsaker and Oates, 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 359, "end": 376, "text": "Struhsaker, 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 377, "end": 389, "text": "Waser, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 577, "end": 604, "text": "Struhsaker and Oates (1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 861, "end": 888, "text": "Struhsaker and Oates (1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1890, "end": 1903, "text": "Bocian, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dietary overlap"}, {"text": "Researchers have suggested that species with particular diets are differentially susceptible to different types of human modification.

They found that smaller species survived disturbance better, and the degree of frugivory was negatively correlated with the ability to survive in degraded habitats. Their strongest conclusion was that large-bodied frugivores are most vulnerable to habitat disturbance, and three exam-ples of large-bodied taxa were presented: Ateles, Pan, and Pongo. However, by scrutinizing evidence on response to disturbance by these three taxa, exceptions are evident. For example, a healthy Ateles geoffroyi population has been described from a severely degraded area that was both intensively logged and grazed by cattle, but where hunting was minimal . Similarly, Pan troglodytes groups are known to survive well in areas that have been logged and almost entirely converted to agriculture (Onderdonk and Chapman, 2000) , apparently by traveling between the few small remaining forest fragments and by raiding crops planted by local farmers (Naughton-Treves et al., 1998) .

She found that mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) appeared to rely on fruits and seeds in the continuous forest (65% of their foraging time), but fruits and seeds were eaten less in fragments (29%). The magnitude of this dietary difference places continuous-forest and fragment-dwelling mangabeys into different foraging guilds (following the definition by Richards, 1985) . This flexibility may permit mangabeys to live in a variety of habitats (for an example of a species that is not flexible in terms of the plant parts eaten in fragments vs. continuous forest, see Onderdonk and Chapman, 2000) .
