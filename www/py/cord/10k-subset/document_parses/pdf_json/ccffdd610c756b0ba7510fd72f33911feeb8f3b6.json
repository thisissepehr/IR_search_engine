They are predators and carrion consumers, and thus, prone to come in contact with disease agents contaminating the environment or infecting live or dead animals. We hypothesized that wild canids could be used as sentinels for the detection of regions with higher Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) prevalence in wild and domestic animals. To test this hypothesis, we set up an ELISA to test 262 wolf (Canis lupus) and fox (Vulpes vulpes) sera for MAP-specific antibodies and processed a subset of samples for culture (n= 61), MAP-specific PCR (15) and histopathology (14). In wolves, the optical density (OD) values in the ELISA were continuously distributed. Ten fox sera (4%) had OD readings of over twice the mean, suggesting contact with mycobacteria. However, all samples tested by PCR were negative for both IS900 and ISMAP02 sequences, and samples cultured for MAP yielded no growth. No visible paratuberculosis or tuberculosis-compatible lesions were recorded. On histopathological examination, no lesions compatible with mycobacterial diseases were observed. These results suggest that wild canids show little or no evidence of paratuberculosis and are unlikely to be useful sentinels for the detection of MAP in Southwestern Europe.",

For example, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been used to detect Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rainwater et al. 2006) and Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Yabsley et al. 2003) , and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) to detect bovine tuberculosis (Nugent et al. 2002) .

Wolves in Spain depend largely on domestic and wild ungulates as a food source (Cuesta et al. 1991; Barja 2009 ). Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are ubiquitous, anthropophilic generalists, with a species abundance ranging from 0.5 to 10 foxes per square kilometer (Gort\u00e1zar 1997) . They are also a game species, which makes sample collection relatively easy. In Spain, the fox behaves as a facultative predator, feeding on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) when they are abundant and shifting to other prey (including carrion of wild and domestic ungulates) when rabbits are scarce (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008) .",

In Spain, MAP is widespread among both domestic and wild ruminants (Garrido 2001; Falconi et al. 2010 ) and has also been recorded in wild rabbits (the authors, submitted). Among red deer (Cervus elaphus), for instance, 30% antibody prevalence was reported, and contact with cattle was identified as a risk factor (Reyes-Garc\u00eda et al. 2008) .",

Briefly, high adsorption capacity Costar polystyrene microtiter plates (Cultek, Madrid, Spain) were coated with 50 \u03bcl/well of 0.02 mg/ml paratuberculosis protoplasmatic antigen 3 (PPA-3) diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (Sigma, Madrid, Spain). The serum samples were adsorbed (1:1, v/v) with a saline suspension of Mycobacterium phlei (5 g/l) (Allied Monitor, Inc., Fayette, MO, USA) and left at 4\u00b0C overnight to remove nonspecific anti-Mycobacterium spp. antibodies (Milner et al. 1987) . Thereafter, the plates were washed once with a washing solution (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with 200 \u03bcl/well of blocking solution (5% nonfat dried milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). After a 1-h incubation period at room temperature, sera diluted 1:20 (v/v) in PBS solution were added into wells of the antigen-coated plate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, before being washed four times with the washing solution. Anti-dog IgG peroxidase antibody produced in rabbits was used as conjugate (Sigma\u00b80.002 mg/ml in blocking solution) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After four washes with washing solution, 200 \u03bcl/well of substrate solution (Fast OPD, Sigma) were added. Approximately 20 min later, the reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcl/well of H 2 SO 4 3N and optical density (OD) was measured in a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. Since no positive controls were available, we used 2\u00d7the mean OD as a conservative arbitrary cutoff (see Fig. 2) .",

These occurred mainly in two bTB endemic areas of Southern Spain, suggesting that cross-reactions after contact with M. bovis could have influenced the ELISA results. Serological cross-reactions of M. bovis, and MAP have often been reported (e.g., Buddle et al. 2010) .

As was discussed earlier, both wolves and foxes include significant portions of wild ruminants and rabbits in their diet. Thus, exposure to MAP was expected but not confirmed.

This finding, in addition to the absence of MAP detection by culture and PCR, suggests that wild canids show little or no evidence of paratuberculosis and are unlikely to be useful sentinels for the detection of MAP in Southwestern Europe.
