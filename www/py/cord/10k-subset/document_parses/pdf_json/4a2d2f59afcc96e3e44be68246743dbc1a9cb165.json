Method: Acute lung injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection with LPS (5 mg/kg), followed by immediate intratracheal instillation of siRNA targeting NF-\u03baB p65 (40 \u03bcg/ml). Animals in each group were sacrificed at 1 h or 8 h after the instillation. Pulmonary histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The levels of NF-\u03baB and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by qRT-PCR. Expressions of NF-\u03baB in lung cells and TNF-\u03b1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Results: LPS administration reduced the rectal temperature and white blood cell counts at 1 h, increased lung wet/dry weight ratios, caused evident lung histopathological injury, and increased the detectable transcript and cytokine levels of TNF-\u03b1 in lung tissue in BALF. siRNA targeting of NF-\u03baB p65 effectively abrogated the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 in lung cells and, aside from rectal temperatures, ameliorated all changes induced by LPS.",

Activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway is a trigger that may initiate an inflammatory cascade and leads to the upregulation of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [15] . NF-\u03baB regulates the expression of these cytokines by directly binding to the consensus sequences in their enhancer/promoter regions [5, 6, 8] . In addition, activation of NF-\u03baB can be induced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins, radiation and other stimulating agents. Importantly, the activation of NF-\u03baB is observed in alveolar macrophages from patients with ARDS [18] , indicating the implication of NF-\u03baB pathway in the development and progression of ALI and ARDS. Therefore, determining whether pharmacologic inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibits the development and progression of ALI may provide a novel more effective therapeutic option for treatment of this disease.",

The rectal temperature of rats was significantly decreased 1 h after LPS administration compared with control group. In contrast, no significant differences among all groups at 8 h were observed. These results indicate that rectal temperature could fully recover within 8 h after the onset of LPS-induced ALI. Immediate intratracheal instillation of NF-\u03baB siRNA had minimal effect on the changes induced by LPS (Fig. 3) . LPS administration significantly reduced white blood cell counts at each time point. At 1 h after LPS administration, immediately intratracheal instillation of NF-\u03baB siRNA did not efficiently increase white blood cell counts. In contrast, at 8 h after LPS administration, it significantly increased white blood cell counts. There were no significant differences in white blood cell counts between LPS + DEPC group and LPS+ scramble group at each time point (Fig. 4) . Compared with control group, the lung wet/dry weight ratio was obviously enhanced after LPS administration at each time point. Rats with NF-\u03baB siRNA instillation had a reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio. No significant differences in the lung wet/dry weight ratio were observed between LPS + DEPC group and LPS+ scramble group at each time point (Fig. 5) .

At 1 h after LPS administration, TNF-\u03b1 transcript levels in LPS + siRNA group were significantly reduced (0.278) compared with that in LPS + scramble group (0.967).

            "text": "Recent years have seen a growth in our understanding of ALI/ARDS, thus leading to a substantial improvement of disease outcome upon pharmacological treatment. Sepsis serves as a leading predisposing factor of ALI and may be the direct result of the LPS on the outer membrane of various gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, LPS can be used to establish ALI animal models through intravenous injection, intraperitoneal injection and intratracheal instillation [6] . At the present time, clinical trials with the use of pharmacologic options abound and include but are not limited to the following [16] : 1, Antiendotoxin and anti-cytokine therapy; 2, Anti-adhesion molecule therapy; 3, Alveolar surfactant replacement therapy; 4, treatment with glucocorticoids which attenuate fibrosis, among others. Despite numerous options, glucocorticoids are among the few that have attained clinical usage. However, their disappointing efficacy in the acute phase of ALI and increased risk of infection leaves much to be desired. In the present study, we undertook the challenge of identifying a novel strategy that was both effective in the early stages of ALI and devoid of side effects by using RNA interference. Fig. 2 NF-\u03baB siRNA administration decreased NF-kB transcript and protein levels in lung tissues of rats with ALI. a qRT-PCR was used to compare the levels of NF-\u03baB mRNA transcription between LPS + scramble group and LPS + siRNA group. The amplification of GAPDH was used as internal control. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 S.D. from three individual experiments. *P < 0.05 vs. LPS+. b Rats were treated with siRNA specific to NF-\u03baB for one or eight hours, lung tissue was collected and processed by western blot analysis to determine the levels of NF-\u03baB p65 expression after one or eight hours Taking advantage of the siRNA technology that has been optimized and made highly efficient in the past decade; we substantiated that intratracheal instillation of NF-\u03baB siRNA exerted rapid and potent anti-inflammatory effects on lungs exposed to LPS. The key of RNA interference (RNAi) lies in delivery and stable expression of siRNA and has been used to cure disorders of the eyes, lungs and central nervous systems [1, 2, 4, 20, 21] . Bitko et. al for the first time demonstrated that intranasal instillation of siRNA free of transfection reagents exerted a robustly anti-inflammatory effect on individual as well as joint infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV), and that when properly designed; direct siRNA administration turns out to be feasible in the treatment of lung diseases. Moreover, this method displays many advantages [1] . First, direct siRNA administration through the respiratory system is relatively simple, noninvasive, and compatible with an inhaler or mist based therapy. Second, the exclusion of a virus-based carrier in this method reduces the potential risk of carrier side effect. Therefore, we employed intratracheal instillation of siRNA to curb the NF-\u03baB pathway activation. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, we were able to effectively target and significantly decrease NF-kB levels in our preclinical model. By using the highly specific siRNA approach, we were able to decrease the detectable levels of NF-kB after LPS administration in rat lungs at 1 and 8 h intervals. These results show that specific siRNA targeting of NF-kB can be accomplished and thus help establish and validate our preclinical model.",

Our data demonstrate that upon ALI induction followed by siRNA, the level of lung injury can be significantly altered (Fig. 1) . In addition to decreasing lung injury, NF-kB knockdown also resulted in a remarkable decline in lung wet/dry weight ratio (Fig. 5) . Multiple attempts have been made through the years to suppress ALI by blocking NF-\u03baB pathway, including stabilization of I\u03baB\u03b1 [8, 9, 11, 12] , inhibition of binding between activated NF-\u03baB dimers and target genes via decoy oligonucleotides [3] , and transcriptional inhibition NF-\u03baB depletion alters lung wet/dry weight ratios after LPS administration. Rats were treated with siRNA specific to NF-\u03baB and lung tissue was collected and processed to assess the wet to dry ratio at one or eight hours. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 12). *P < 0.05 vs. saline + DEPC;#P < 0.05 vs. LPS + DEPC;\u25b3P < 0.05 vs. LPS + scramble Fig. 6 Specific targeting of NF-\u03baB ablates TNF-\u03b1 transcript and protein levels in lung tissue.

Recently, drugs such as butyrate [14] and pitavastatin [19] were found to be effective in preventing the initiation of ALI by interacting with NF-\u03baB pathway. These attempts, however, have limited clinical merit primarily because they cannot specifically block the NF-\u03baB pathway without impairing other cellular activities, leading to known and unknown side effects. Furthermore, the necessary pretreatment is also a bottleneck in clinical practice. In contrast, the high specificity of siRNA without the need of pretreatment in our study makes it a more ideal strategy compared with other methods. Taken together, our data represent a novel and highly effective way to specifically target NF-kB, reduce lung injury while minimizing detrimental and unwanted side effects.",

As seen in Fig. 6a and b, NF-\u03baB siRNA effectively suppressed levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA transcription and concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 in BALF, providing evidence to support the possibility that the mechanism of NF-\u03baB siRNA's anti-inflammatory effects is likely associated with the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. TNF\u03b1, however, can be regulated by other pathways, and should e further investigated but are beyond the scope of this manuscript [9] .",

Therefore, we offer the following; NF-\u03baB siRNA treatment represents an effective and novel strategy for modulating inflammatory response for ALI in the early stages with high clinical relevancy. One important point is that we acknowledge that a limitation of the study is the direct translational implications of our findings as NF-\u03baB siRNA treatment in humans would represent a significant challenge given that clinical symptoms appear much later then the time points investigated here.
