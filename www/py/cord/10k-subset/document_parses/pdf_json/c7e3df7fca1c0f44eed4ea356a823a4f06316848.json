After removing the area effect, habitat diversity explained 15.6% of variance, while prevailing vegetation type explained 29.6%. After removing the effect of both area and vegetation type, the resulting model explained 10.3% of the variance, indicating that species richness further increased with habitat diversity, and most obviously towards warm districts. After removing the effects of area, habitat diversity and climatic district, the model still explained 9.4% of the variance, and showed that species richness (i) significantly decreased with increasing mean altitude and annual precipitation, and with decreasing January temperature in the region of the mountain flora, and (ii) increased with altitudinal range in regions of temperate and thermophilous flora.",

The direct habitat effect on species richness was roughly equal to the direct area effect, but the total direct and indirect effects of area slightly exceeded that of habitat. It was shown that the overall effect of composite variables such as altitude or climatic district can be separated into particular climatic variables, which influence the richness of flora in a context-specific manner. The statistical explanation of richness variation at the level of families yielded similar results to that for species, indicating that the system of nature conservation provides similar degrees of protection at different taxonomic levels.",

In nature protection, biodiversity is considered a suitable measure of the quality of environment (Usher, 1986; Pickett et al., 1997) . At the regional level, diversity has been related to various factors such as area (for a detailed analysis of species-area relations see Rosenzweig, 1995) , altitude (Rahbek, 1995) , climate, productivity (Swift & Anderson, 1994) , landscape heterogeneity (Turner, 1987) , successional status and disturbance (Osbornov\u00e1 et al., 1990; Huston, 1994; Bazzaz, 1996) . These factors do not act separately but are, to a greater or lesser extent, mutually correlated (Whittaker, 1972; Ozenda, 1988) , which makes it difficult to assess the role each plays in determining species richness (Kohn & Walsh, 1994) .",

Diversity is expressed in terms of the number of species, which is a commonly used measure in biogeographically orientated studies (Ricklefs & Schluter, 1993) . These data have been analysed to determine the effects of individual factors, unbiased by correlations with other variables. The paper attempts to answer the following questions: (1) What is the overall pattern in species richness at different taxonomic levels? (2) Do particular vegetation types differ in the number of species they contain? (3) What are the main factors determining the number of species in central European landscapes? (4) What is the relative importance of particular groups of factors, especially those related to climate compared with those determined by habitat characteristics?

In 1996, there were 1757 small-sized nature reserves protected in the Czech Republic, covering an area of 823 km 2 , i.e. 1.05% of the territory of the country (Kos & Mars\u00e1kov\u00e1, 1997) . Of these, 302 had suitable data for the purpose of the present study and they represent 17.2% of the total number. However, the focus was on important reserves, which are usually larger in land area; therefore those that were sampled covered an area of 365 km 2 (accounting for 0.46% of the country's territory, and 44.2% of the total area of nature reserves). The set of reserves studied may be considered as a highly representative sample of the natural vegetation of the study area.",

Calculations were made using general linear modelling in the commercial statistical package GLIM\u00ae v. 4 (Francis et al., 1994) . The intent of each analysis was to determine the minimal adequate model. In this model, all parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) different from zero and from one another. This was achieved by a stepwise process of model simplification, beginning with the maximal model (containing all factors, interactions and covariates that might be of interest), then proceeding by the elimination of non-significant terms (using deletion tests from the maximal model) and retention of significant terms. The transformed numbers of species or residuals were the response variables, and vegetation type, climatic district, phytogeographical region and climax community were factors. Reserve area, habitat diversity, density of human population, mean altitude, altitudinal range, annual precipitation, precipitation in the growing season, mean temperature, January isotherm and June isotherm were covariates. Because the explanatory variables were often highly correlated, and to prevent biases to the model structures caused by correlation, model simplifications were made by backward elimination from the maximal models by using stepwise analyses of deviance tables (e.g. Crawley, 1993: 192 -197) . In the maximal model, each covariate was regressed on each factor with a different intercept and a different slope. In the first step of model simplification, the different slopes of each covariate on each factor were in turn replaced by a common slope of each factor on each covariate. The common slopes were regressed on the factors one after another, and the changes in residual deviance caused by removal of the different slopes for each covariate were assessed. All covariates with a common slope were assessed, then all non-significantly different slopes were deleted, and a reduced model was assessed. The analysis then continued on the reduced model. In this model, all the remaining terms were deleted in turn from the reduced deviance table, and only those leading to a significant increase in residual deviance were retained. The deletion tests were repeated on the reduced models until, after removing from the last deviance table, the minimal adequate model that contained nothing but significant terms was determined. The results obtained were thus not affected by the order in which the explanatory variables were removed in the step-wise process of model simplification.",

As the relationship between the number of species in the reserves and that of genera was very close (Pearson's correlation coefficient, square-rooted numbers = 0.99, n = 302), an additional separate analysis was performed only for the number of families, which had a lower correlation value with species richness (Pearson's correlation coefficient, square-rooted numbers = 0.91, n = 302). The statistical analysis of richness at the level of families, using the same models as for the number of species, none the less always yielded similar, but less significant results, explaining a lower proportion of the variance.

In this model (Table 3 : Model 4), a significant effect of altitude and climate on species richness in phytogeographical regions was found after filtering out the effect of reserve area, habitat diversity and climatic district (F = 6.11; d.f. = 5, 296; P < 0.0001). With these effects removed, the regions of thermophilous, temperate and mountain floras did not differ from each other in the number of species (F residuals = 1.41; d.f. = 2, 289; P = 0.25). However, within-region differences in species richness were found. Species richness in mountain floras significantly decreased with mean altitude of the reserve (regression slope = -0.0062 \u00b1 0.0024) (F = 6.90; d.f. = 1, 297; P = 0.009) but increased (F = 3.43; d.f. = 2, 298; P = 0.03) with the altitudinal range of the reserve in regions of both temperate (regression slope = 0.0069 \u00b1 0.0035) and thermophilous floras (regression slope = 0.01 \u00b1 0.0054). When evaluating particular climatic parameters, the effect of annual precipitation (F = 10.53; d.f. = 1, 295; P = 0.001) and especially that of January temperature (F = 21.76; d.f. = 1, 297; P < 0.0001) was significant for the region of the mountain flora: species richness decreased with increasing precipitation (regression slope = -0.0069 \u00b1 0.0021) and with decreasing January temperature (regression slope = -2.78 \u00b1 0.60).",

Therefore they reflect, unlike other habitat types affected more severely by humans, a more or less natural distribution pattern of plant species. It can be assumed that in nature reserves, factors affecting species distribution in particular vegetation types are less biased by human-related factors operating in the present central-European landscape. The data from nature reserves are thus better suited for analyses attempting to separate the effects of factors determining species richness than are complete floristic surveys across all habitats of a given region. The set of reserves studied is a highly representative sample of natural vegetation of the study area and the pattern found in the present study has therefore general validity in terms of central European vegetation. Moreover, in previously published analyses the effects of explanatory variables were often masked by their covariance structure. The statistical approach used in this paper allows us to evaluate the effects of particular factors, independent of other variables. The analysis thus gives a sound basis for unbiased discussion of regional patterns of plant species richness. Concerning possible bias in the quality of species lists given by the identities of the data collectors, this is inevitably associated with any study based on secondary data. None the less, the results presented here are robust enough not to be affected by this.",

However, the sampling method and size of the area sampled may influence strongly the results of particular studies (Rahbek, 1995) . This shortcoming was overcome in our research by filtering out the effect of area. The results still indicated that altitude affected the pattern of species richness and that this effect was different in particular phytogeographical districts. In the region of the mountain flora, species number decreased with altitude, which suggests a relationship between species diversity and productivity (Brown & Gibson, 1983; Currie, 1991; Cox & Moore, 1993) . The results of this paper show further that the effect of altitude on species richness in a temperate landscape is context-dependent because at lower altitudes, i.e. in regions of temperate and thermophilous flora, an increase in altitudinal range contributes to the enrichment of floristic diversity. In dealing with particular climatic parameters, low winter temperatures, characterized by the January isotherm, and high precipitation were found as significant predictors of species richness of the mountain flora in the Czech Republic. In western Norway, species richness was predicted well by mean July and January temperatures and mean annual precipitation, and a linear relationship between July temperature and the number of vascular plants was found between 700 and 1500 m of altitude (Odland & Birks, 1999) . In a study on diversity of woody plants in southern Africa, climate accounted for 74 -79% of variation in species richness (O'Brien et al., 1998) . Richness of vascular plants in Fennoscandia, sampled in squares of standard size, was correlated closely with geographical (latitude and longitude) and climatic variables, explaining over 80% of the variation (Grytnes et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "The effect of habitat diversity (as a measure of landscape heterogeneity) on species diversity has been studied thoroughly on islands (e.g. Connor & McCoy, 1979; van der Werf, 1983) . For instance, close positive correlations have been observed between species number, island area and the number of habitat types on the Shetland islands (Kohn & Walsh, 1994) . In a sense, nature reserves in the agricultural / industrial landscape of central Europe can be considered as habitat islands (Begon et al., 1990) , i.e. islands of remnants of natural vegetation surrounded by a landscape of remarkably distinct features. For many species, the surrounding landscape represents a dispersal barrier (Forman, 1995) . There is agreement about the probable joint importance of area and habitat diversity, but their simultaneous effect on species numbers has rarely been considered. Kohn & Walsh (1994) reported that area affected species numbers on islands both directly and indirectly, through habitat diversity, and that while the direct effects of area and habitat on species were of about the same magnitude, the total effect of area was nearly twice that of habitats. Kohn & Walsh's conclusion corresponds to our results in that there was about the same direct effect of area and of habitat diversity on species number in both studies, but the indirect effect of area in our study was very low and consequently the total effect of area was only slightly higher than that of habitat diversity. Also, the direct effect of area on the number of habitats reported for the Shetland islands (Kohn & Walsh, 1994) was five times stronger than the value found in mainland central-European reserves (0.915 vs. 0.179). It must be borne in mind that both the sampling scale and the definition of habitats are probably crucial to the nature of resulting relationships. Nevertheless, the habitat classification adopted by Kohn & Walsh (1994) corresponds more or less to that used in the present study (both in terms of detail and classification criteria). Hence it can be concluded that on an island, area exerts a much more powerful effect on habitat diversity than in large mainland reserves, and this relationship has a profound effect on the pattern of species diversity. As suggested by Kohn & Walsh (1994) , straightforward relationships in the island system may derive from their relative simplicity, while in other systems the relationships between species, area and habitats may be obscured.",

Therefore, not only the total species number but also native species were analysed separately. Both approaches, however, yielded similar results. This may be explained by (a) a relatively low contribution of aliens to the total species number (Pysek et al., 2002) and (b) the fact that alien species contribute to the total species number by occupying vacant niches, which form an integral part of the habitats studied and would otherwise possibly be occupied by other (native) species. The only marked difference between both data sets was that when aliens were excluded, the explanatory power of altitude decreased, reflecting the confinement of introduced species to warmer situations in central Europe (Pysek et al., 1995) .",

Similarly, O'Brien et al. (1998) reported on similar effects at the three taxonomic levels (species, generic and family). This is caused by a very close correlation between number of taxa at particular taxonomic levels. In other studies, family richness was a good predictor of species richness for a variety of groups and regions (Williams & Gaston, 1994) and the correlation between species richness and that of genera (r = 0.97) and families (r = 0.89), respectively, in the British Isles, yielded values very similar to those reported in this study. These results indicate that in central Europe, conservation measures adopted to maintain species diversity effectively contribute to maintenance of overall evolutionary variation of the regional flora.",
