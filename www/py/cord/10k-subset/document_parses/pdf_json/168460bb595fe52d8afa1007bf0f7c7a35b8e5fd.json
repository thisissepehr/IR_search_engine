The impact of the vaccination strategy with the vaccine efficacy is explored. In particular, the model exhibits backward bifurcations under the vaccination level, and bistability occurrence can be observed. Mathematically, a bifurcation analysis is performed, and the conditions ensuring that the system exhibits backward bifurcation are provided. The global dynamics of the equilibrium in the model are also investigated. Numerical simulations are also conducted to confirm and extend the analytic results.",

            "text": "Mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases [2] . Based on the theory of Kermack and Mckendrick [19] , the spread of infectious diseases usually can be described mathematically by compart-mental models such as SIR, SIRS, SEIR, SEIRS models (where S represents the class of the susceptible population, E is the exposed class in the latent period, I is infectious class, R is the removed class, which has recovered with temporary or permanent immunity). In recent years, a variety of compartmental models have been formulated, and the mathematical analysis of epidemiology models has advanced rapidly, and the analyzed results are applied to infectious diseases [2, 18, 32] . Vaccination campaigns have been critical in attacking the spread of infectious diseases, e.g., pertussis, measles, and influenza. The eradication of smallpox has been considered as the most spectacular success of vaccination [44] . Although vaccination has been an effective strategy against infectious diseases, current preventive vaccine consisting of inactivated viruses do not protect all vaccine recipients equally. The vaccine-based protection is dependent on the immune status of the recipient [2, 32] . For example, influenza vaccines protect 70-90% of the recipients among healthy young adults and as low as 30-40% of the elderly and others with weakened immune systems (such as HIV-infected or immuno-suppressed transplant patients) (see, [14, 30, 44] ).",

            "text": "Since vaccination is the process of administering weakened or dead pathogens to a healthy person or animal, with the intent of conferring immunity against a targeted form of a related disease agent, the individuals having the vaccine-induced immunity can be distinguished from the recovered individuals by natural immunity. Thus, vaccination can also be considered by adding some compartment naturally into the basic epidemic models. Over the past few decades, a large number of simple compartmental mathematical models with vaccinated population have been used in the literature to assess the impact or potential impact of imperfect vaccines for combatting the transmission diseases [1, 3, 11, 16, 20, 21, 23, 31, 43, 45] . In some of these studies (e.g., papers [16, 31, 43] ), authors have shown that the dynamics of the model are determined by the disease's basic reproduction number 0 . If 0 < 1 the disease can be eliminated from the community; whereas an endemic occurs if 0 > 1. Therefore, if an efficient vaccination campaign acts to reduce the disease's basic reproduction number 0 below the critical level of 1, then the disease can be eradicated. While in other studies, such as Alexander et al. [1] and Arino et al. [3] , they have shown that the criterion for 0 < 1 is not always sufficient to control the spread of a disease. A phenomenon known as a backward bifurcation is observed. Mathematically speaking, when a backward bifurcation occurs, there are at least three equilibria for 0 < 1 in the model: the stable disease-free equilibrium, a large stable endemic equilibrium, and a small unstable endemic equilibrium which acts as a boundary between the basins of attraction for the two stable equilibria. In some cases, a backward bifurcation leading to bistability can occur. Thus, it is possible for the disease itself to become endemic in a population, given a sufficiently large initial outbreak. These phenomena have important epidemiological consequences for disease management. In recent years, backward bifurcation, which leads to multiple and subthreshold equilibria, has been attracting much attention (see, [1, 3, 4, 6, 11, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 33, 34, 37, 40] ). Several mechanisms with vaccination have been identified to cause the occurrence of backward bifurcation in paper [33] .",

Finally, since the immunity acquired by infection wanes with time, the recovered individuals have the possibility \u03b3 3 of becoming susceptible again. \u03b2 is the transmission coefficient (rate of effective contacts between susceptible and infective individuals per unit time; this coefficient includes rate of contacts and effectiveness of transmission).

We illustrate here that there are limiting cases in system (2.1): if \u03c3 = 0, the vaccine is perfectly effective, and \u03b1 = \u03c8 = 0, there is no vaccination, system (2.1) will be reduced to the standard SEIRS model in [28] ; if \u03b3 3 = 0 and the limit \u03b3 1 \u2192 \u221e, system (2.1) will be equivalent to an SVIR model in [31] . If we let \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b3 3 = 0, system (2.1) can be reduced to an SVEIR epidemic model in [16] , where authors aim to assess the potential impact of a SARS vaccine via mathematical modelling. To explore the effect of the vaccination period and the latent period on disease dynamics, an SVEIR epidemic model with ages of vaccination and latency are formulated in paper [10] . In papers [10, 16, 28, 31] , authors have shown that the dynamics of the model are determined by the disease's basic reproduction number 0 . That is, the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for 0 \u2264 1; and there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable if 0 > 1. If \u03c8 = 0 and limit \u03b3 1 \u2192 \u221e, system (2.1) will be reduced into an SIV epidemic model in [36] , where authors investigate the effect of imperfect vaccines on the disease's transmission dynamics. In [36] , it is shown that reducing the basic reproduction number 0 to values less than one no longer guarantees disease eradication. In this paper, we show that if a vaccination campaign with an imperfect vaccine and the disease cycle is considered, a more complicated dynamic behavior is observed in system (2.1). For example, the backward bifurcation occurs in system (2.1). In the following, first, it is easy to obtain that the total population N in system (2.1) is constant. To Simplify our notation, we define the occupation variable of compartments S, E, I, V, and R as the respective fractions of a constant population N that belong to each of the corresponding compartments. We still write the occupation variable of compartments as S, E, I, V and R, respectively. Thus, it is easy to verify that",

Here, we follow the techniques and approaches in paper [3, 16] to investigate global stability of the endemic equilibrium in system (2.3). Here, we omit the introduction of the general mathematical framework of these theorems and only focus on their applications. In the previous section, we have showed that if R vac > 1, system (2.3) has a unique endemic equilibrium in D. Furthermore, R vac > 1 implies that the disease-free equilibrium P 0 is unstable (Theorem 3.2) . The instability of P 0 , together with P 0 \u2208 \u2202D, implies the uniform persistence of the state variables.

Backward bifurcation under the vaccination level conditions, and bistability phenomena can be observed. The global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium in the model is demonstrated for R vac > 1. Note that the model (2.3) can be solved in an efficient way by means of the multistage Adomian decomposition method (MADM) as a relatively new method [8, 9, 12, 13] . The MADM has some superiority over the conventional solvers such as the R-K family. To illustrate the various theoretical results contained in this paper, the effect of some important parameter values on the dynamical behavior of system (2.3) is investigated in the following.

By direct calculating, it is easy to verify that M 1 is negative and also condition (H 3 ) is satisfied. Figure 4 depicts the backward bifurcation occurring phenomena with lower vaccine efficacy with \u03c3 = 0.15; Fig. 5 depicts the likelihood of backward bifurcation occurring with higher vaccine efficacy \u03c3 = 0.45.",

From the above analysis, we have found that the dynamics of the model are not determined by the basic reproduction number, and the phenomena of the backward bifurcation in system may occur. Moreover, it is found that the occurrence feasibility is increasing with the loss rate of immunity \u03b3 3 . From the following expression,",

            "text": "it is easy to see that the policy of vaccinations with imperfect vaccines can decrease the the basic reproduction number R vac . Thus, the imperfect vaccine may be beneficial to the community. This is also a positive point, sice it is know that the use of some imperfect vaccine can sometime result in detrimental consequences to the community [3, 20] . At last, we must point out that although the system (2.3) with (2.2) is well posed mathematically, we acknowledge the biological reality that the fraction of the constant total population which occupies a compartment can only be within the subset Q of rational values within R 5 + , and furthermore only within a sub-subset of values within Q belonging to n/N where n belongs to the integers Z \u2208 [0, N ]. In addition, we also point out that the analysis of the model (2.1) may become somewhat different if disease fatalities and more complex vital dynamics are included, in particular, if the population size is no longer constant. In the future, we may investigate many various modeling possibilities to simulate a real world biological process based on model (2.1). On the other hand, we note that the population in our model (2.1) is assumed to be homogeneously mixed. In fact, different individual may have different number of contacts. Thus, a complex network-based approach on diseases transmission may be closer to a realistic situation [7, 41, 42] . In the future, we shall investigate dynamics of the proposed model based on a complex network.",

Remark 1 From Theorem 3.5, it can follows that the occurrence of either a backward or forward bifurcation may be expected. In fact, in system (2.3), let \u03b1 = 0.3, \u03bc = 0.00004566, \u03b2 = 0.4, \u03c8 = 0.01, \u03b3 1 = 0.1, \u03b3 2 = 0.05, \u03b3 3 = 0.033, \u03c3 = 0.15. It is easy to verify that the condition (H 3 ) is satisfied. By applying Xpp plot software and choosing the above parameters, we can describe the backward bifurcation diagram of system (2.3) (see,Fig. 2). Let all parameter values be same as inFig. 2, except \u03c8 is changed as 0.2. The condition (H 3 ) is not satisfied and we have forward bifurcation diagramFig. 3at R vac = 1.
