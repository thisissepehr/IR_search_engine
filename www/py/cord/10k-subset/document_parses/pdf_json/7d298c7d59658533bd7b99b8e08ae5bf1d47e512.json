However, the cause of dysphagia development by halo-vest fixation is not yet clear. We therefore investigated the incidence of dysphagia and cervical alignment as well as clinical data from medical charts in patients treated with a halo-vest brace. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from the medical charts of 49 patients who had undergone halo-vest fixation. Occipito (O)-C2 angle, C2-C6 angle, and pharyngeal inlet angle were assessed by lateral plain Xrays of the cervical spine. The impacts of these parameters on incidence and severity of dysphagia were analyzed. Results: Thirteen patients (32%) suffered from dysphagia during halo-vest fixation, and age and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were greater in the dysphagia group (p = 0.044 and 0.013, respectively) than in those who did not develop dysphagia. O-C2 angle was smaller in the dysphagia group (p = 0.016). After multivariate logistic analysis, body mass index, ICU stay, and O-C2 angle remained as independent risk factors related to incidence of dysphagia. Spearman rank correlation showed a negative correlation between ICU stay and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) (p = 0.026), and a positive correlation between O-C2 angle and FILS (p = 0.008).

Figure 3a and c show that O-C2 angle correlated significantly with both C2-C6 angle and PIA, suggesting the existence of collinearity among each of the radiographic measurement items investigated in the study. The coefficient ratios suggested that O-C2 angle may provide the greatest contribution to the incidence of dysphagia among the items examined. However, other components of occipitocervical alignment such as translation forward or back in the horizontal plane and/or angulation at different areas of cervical spine may also affect the incidence of dysphagia. Further studies are warranted to clarify other radiographic measurement items affecting swallowing functions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 266, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 587, "text": "Figure 3a", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study had several limitations, including the retrospective study design.
