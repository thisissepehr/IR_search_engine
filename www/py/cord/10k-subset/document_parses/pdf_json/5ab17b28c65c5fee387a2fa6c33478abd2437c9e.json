While typically asymptomatic, HCMV can cause fatal disease among congenitally infected infants and immunocompromised patients. These clinical issues are compounded by the emergence of antiviral resistance and the absence of an effective vaccine, the development of which is likely complicated by the numerous immune evasins encoded by HCMV to counter the host's adaptive immune responses, a feature that facilitates frequent super-infections. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HCMV is essential for the development of effective new drugs and vaccines. By comparing viral genomes from uncultivated or low-passaged clinical samples of diverse origins, we observe evidence of frequent homologous recombination events, both recent and ancient, and no structure of HCMV genetic diversity at the whole-genome scale. Analysis of individual gene-scale loci reveals a striking dichotomy: while most of the genome is highly conserved, recombines essentially freely and has evolved under purifying selection, 21 genes display extreme diversity, structured into distinct genotypes that do not recombine with each other. Most of these hyper-variable genes encode glycoproteins involved in cell entry or escape of host immunity. Evidence that half of them have diverged through episodes of intense positive selection suggests that rapid evolution of hyper-variable loci is likely driven by interactions with host immunity. It appears that this process is enabled by recombination unlinking hyper-variable loci from strongly constrained neighboring sites. It is conceivable that viral mechanisms facilitating super-infection have evolved to promote recombination between diverged genotypes, allowing the virus to continuously diversify at key loci to escape immune detection, while maintaining a genome optimally adapted to its asymptomatic infectious lifecycle.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) species are widespread among mammals, establishing life-long infections in their specific host. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has a linear dsDNA genome of approximately 235 kb encoding at least 165 canonical ORFs (Dolan et al. 2004) , plus many alternative transcripts and pervasive translation outside these annotated ORFs revealed by recent expression analyses (Murphy et al. 2003; Stern-Ginossar et al. 2012) . The genome of HCMV consists of two domains (L and S), each comprising a unique region (U L and U S ) flanked by an inverted repeat sequence (TR L and IR L , TR S and IR S ), yielding the genome configuration TR L -U L -IR L -IR S -U S -TR S . While primary infection of healthy individuals is common but usually asymptomatic, HCMV infections of severely immune-suppressed individuals (e.g. HIV-infected and transplant patients) cause significant morbidity and mortality (Rubin 1989; Snydman 1990; Krause et al. 2013; Manicklal et al. 2013) . Additionally, trans-placental transmissions of HCMV are the commonest viral cause of severe birth defects in infants (Ross et al. 2006 ). These problems are compounded by growing antiviral resistance and the lack of an effective vaccine (Krause et al. 2013 ) and there remains an unmet need for data on viral diversity and HCMV evolution to facilitate the development of new intervention strategies to prevent and/or counteract HCMV pathology. Very recently, the high frequency of recombination at the genome-wide level has been observed (Sijmons et al. 2015) . This sheds new light on the understanding of HCMV evolution, in particular regarding recent studies where rapid fixation of novel point mutations was thought to be the main mechanism for intra-host diversification (Renzette et al. 2011; Renzette et al. 2013) .

The largest of these linked hypervariable loci spans the RL11 region, which encodes glycoproteins with multiple functions related to immunity and tropism. The rapid evolution of this locus, both within HCMV and between primate CMV species, suggests an important role for these genes in CMV genome adaptation to their host.

Both actions were performed using in-house PERL scripts developed by the PATHSEEK consortium. The specificity of the baits was verified by BLASTn searches against the Human Genomic \u00fe Transcript database. The custom designed HCMV bait library was uploaded to SureDesign and synthesized by Agilent Technologies (San Diego, USA). Following library preparation and enrichment for HCMV DNA by hybridization using the SureSelect XT v1.5 protocol (200 ng starting material), modified only to increase the post-hybridization PCR yield where viral loads were low, deep sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq (500 bp v2 kits) was performed yielding millions of 2\u00c2250 bp paired-end reads.

Alignments of genes RL12, UL50, UL146, and IRS1 were discarded because most sites in gene sequences were not homologous. Alignments were subsequently scanned for within-gene recombination breakpoints using the GARD algorithm from the HyPhy package (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006a, b) , and the alignment was split according to significant breakpoints. Contrary to LD analysis, GARD screen does not have a site-scale resolution since it relies on regional signals to detect significant disagreement of the phylogenetic signals found on each side of the breakpoints (phylogeny reconstructed under the HKY85 substitution model, rejection of common history based on a Kishino-Hasegawa test, P < 0.05) (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006 ). However, it permitted us to ascertain that, in each (part of a) gene, any phylogenetic signal that is found with strong support is stemming from a unique vertical history. The 202 alignments obtained for each gene or gene part resulting from GARD analysis (hereafter simply called genes) were used for a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using MrBayes (version 3.2.2) (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) under a GTR \u00fe I \u00fe 4C nucleotide substitution model and default parameters (notably two independent runs of four chains over 1,000,000 generations, including 250,000 discarded as burn-in and then sampling of trees every 500 generations). We took advantage of the recent study by Sijmons et al. (2015) and the resource of gene alignments they provided to extend our dataset by merging Sijmons et al.'s gene alignments with those produced in the present study (split at the same recombination breakpoints as determined previously), using MAFFT--merge option (Katoh and Standley 2013) . This resulted in a set of 181 alignments with at most 142 sequences (some genes being missing in certain strains) which we used to replicate all downstream analysis, exception made of the BranchSiteREL positive selection scan (see below). In that case, the smaller dataset is sufficiently representative of the species' diversity to cover all major deep splits, whereas the larger number of branches per tree in the extended dataset (ca. 300) would have unnecessarily lowered the power of the branch-wise test.

This method enables the recognition of similar clusters of strains along the genome, signing their recent history of common descent. In particular this approach does not require that all sequences share the history of descent across loci (i.e. that gene tree topologies are completely matching) and hence allows identification of haplotypes shared by a group of strains where other strains are recombining. A similar matrix can be obtained for the compatibility score of bipartitions with the gene alignment, defined as one minus the maximal PP support observed for any bipartition that is topologically exclusive (incompatible) with the bipartition of interest ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The latter approach allows a more sensitive scan for shared histories among genes as it detects nonexclusive signals from non-fully resolved parts of trees, and, at the same time, it can reveal gene alignments in which no signal is contained as they will not reject many or all possible bipartitions (vertical blue smears in Supplementary Fig. S1 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 262, "end": 283, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1089, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1439, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Gene phylogenies"}, {"text": "To perform an LD scan at the genomic scale, a 238,390-bp alignment of the 42 genomes dataset (excluding the TR L , IR L , IR S , and TR S regions) was restricted to its 22,159 bi-allelic positions having at most one missing sequence.

Significance of LD was tested using Fisher's exact test on the 2\u00c22 contingency table of counts of possible allele pairs. First, we searched the all-versus-all biallelic site matrix for significant associations at P < 0.05, using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

Because the physical spacing of sites impacts directly the expected linkage between them, we modified the scan so that bi-allelic SNP density is constant and cannot bias our measure of LD: we used windows of fixed physical size in which a constant number of 20 bi-allelic sites were sub-sampled so that their spacing is the closest possible to uniformity.

We generated synthetic genomes where nucleotidic diversity is homogeneous, but population structure and recombination rate varies among loci. On one hand, 21 background loci of $500 bp were simulated following trees that have no strong clonal structure and underwent homologous recombination during evolution, with different histories of orthologous replacement events in each of their five $100-bp partitions; this yielded a background of mosaic phylogenetic history marked by recombination (expected to induce strong homoplasy signatures).

Similarly, each branch within the clade was systematically singled out to test if it increased the variance of the subtree's branch lengths, and if so was pruned accordingly. This step was repeated after pruning until no evaluated branch was to prune in the evaluated clade, then higher clades were explored, until reaching the root of the gene tree. This procedure yielded for each gene tree a forest of subtrees, which defined clusters of strains, or genotypes. To avoid later statistical biases when comparing gene trees with heterogeneous numbers of genotypes, the number of genotypes to obtain was fixed to 8 (median of unrestricted genotype counts over all genes), meaning that the iterative pruning procedure was stopped when reaching this number. Alternatively, if not enough significant genotypes were found on the first pass, the procedure was repeated on all branches, including new branches resulting from the previous pruning steps, with a sensitivity increased by halving the thresholds of the test described above. The final set of genotypes is indicated in Supplementary Table S1 . This approach and the parameters used here were designed to produce clusters of significantly diverged strains independently of the variable evolutionary rate of each gene.

The majority of genes showed no significant association with genes other than their immediate neighbor (Fig. 1A) . The most striking exception to his trend is the cluster of 13 genes (RL10 to UL11, included in the structured RL10-UL13 region reported above) in substantially higher LD, consistent with locally reduced recombination (Fig. 1B) . The average linkage between direct neighbour genes in this region is r 2 \u00bc 0.45, and the most distal genes in the locus, RL10 and UL11, are 9 kb apart and yet are in tighter linkage (r 2 \u00bc 0.34) than the average for pairs of direct neighbor genes elsewhere in the genome (r 2 \u00bc 0.18). This region includes multiple genes from the RL11 family and is hereafter referred to as the RL11 region. A comparative similarity analysis of the HCMV proteomes demonstrates substantial variation in this region (across the protein-coding loci in the region, the most divergent pairwise strain comparisons range from 30 percent to 70 percent protein identity) ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, when extending this comparison to include all primate CMV and murine CMV species, this region consistently retains the highest genetic variability (Fig. 2B) .

A total of 22,159 bi-allelic sites were identified within the 238-kb whole-genome alignment. Using Fisher's exact tests for all pairwise site comparisons, we identified 19,084 significantly linked site pairs (Bonferroni-corrected P values < 0.05). The maximal distance between linked sites was 16.35 kb, with 99 percent of the distances falling below 3 kb and 87 percent below 1 kb. The latter analysis points to the absence of long-range linkage among most sites of HCMV genomes and supports widespread intra-and inter-genic recombination. Given the near-absence of long-range linkage in the HCMV genomes, we next searched for short-scale patterns of excessive LD using a local LD index (see Methods section) in sliding windows of 700 bp over the whole genome alignment (Supplementary File S4).

Their primary divergence may, however, have been driven by positive selective pressure, i.e. selection for changes in the resultant protein. To test this hypothesis, we scanned all HCMV gene trees using the aBSREL algorithm (Kosakovsky Smith et al. 2015) and show that the genomes evolved mostly under purifying selection, with an average dN/dS of 0.18 over their complete evolutionary history (branch length-weighted average of mean dN/dS values for all branches pooled across all genes). This constraint on the diversification of encoded proteins is also seen within hyper-variable genes (average dN/dS of 0.22) but to a lesser extent than in other genes (average dN/dS of 0.17, t-test P value < 0.003) (Supplementary Fig. S3 ).

Indeed, when using an alternative method based on pairwise sequence comparisons that does not make assumptions about the phylogenetic history of samples (Yang and Nielsen 2000) , we generally fail to detect positive selection in recombining genes (data not shown). Closer examination of the nine positively selected hypervariable genes identified episodes of positive selection in the deep branches separating the diverged genotypes as well as on terminal branches (Supplementary File S5), in contrast with purifying selection occurring in the rest of branches (Supplementary Table S2 ).

In this respect, this viral species can be considered to behave as a single freely recombining worldwide population. This observation is in line with the absence of any apparent geographical or epidemiological structure in the HCMV population at the genome-wide level (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6) , as has previously been reported for individual gene markers (Haberland et al. 1999; Pignatelli et al. 2004; Bradley et al. 2008 ). Recombination of sub-genomic fragments has previously been observed for Epstein-Barr virus and also genome-wide for herpes simplex virus 1&2, VZV, and murine CMV (Walling et al. 1994; Lingen et al. 1997; Norberg et al. 2007; Norberg et al. 2011; Norberg et al 2015; Smith et al. 2013) , and thus appears to be a hallmark of many herpesviruses. Recombination is indeed known to be a crucial step of the replication process in HSV-1 (Wilkinson and Weller 2003) and has been postulated to occur between superinfecting as well as reactivating genomes in HCMV (Chou 1989; Haberland et al. 1999; Steininger et al. 2005; Garrigue et al. 2007; Steininger 2007; Faure-Della Corte et al. 2010) . The topology of long haplotypes observed between pairs of strains is suggestive of recombination occurring through large replacement events, for example, by crossing-over or joining replicated genome segments (Wilkinson and Weller 2003) rather than by localized gene conversion events. The recent study from Sijmons et al. (2015) also reported the occurrence of intense, genome-wide homologous recombination in HCMV genomes and similarly stressed the heterogeneity of the recombination intensity across the genome. However, the map of the recombination landscape resulting from their analysis differs markedly from ours. Using recombination breakpoint detection methods, they showed a globally higher prevalence of recombination in genes with higher diversity (Sijmons et al. 2015) . These breakpoint methods are appropriate to identify partitions of sequence alignments with different phylogenetic history (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006 ) in order to treat them separately in downstream analyses -as we did ourselves for our gene-scale analyses. However, recombination breakpoints are generically identified from the conflicting phylogenetic signals estimated over their flanking segments of sequence. Breakpoint detection methods thus can only report a finite number of recombination events per locus, which are biased towards the most obvious, i.e. recent events. This limited account of recombination history thus leads to a biased estimate of recombination intensities. In addition, methods like GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006) , which involve the reconstruction and comparison of phylogenetic trees, can be afflicted by high rates of false positives in the face of strong evolutionary rate variation across a gene sequence; a situation often met in genes with hyper-variable domains but highly conserved otherwise (e.g. in UL55/gB). Finally, these methods, like all polymorphism-based analyses, are highly biased towards the detection of more recombination breakpoints in more variable genomic regions. Conversely, LD can be quantified at every variable site and naturally integrates the effect of recombination over long evolutionary times. For all these reasons, we feel that the analysis of variation of recombination intensities within HCMV genomes is better addressed by the approach we deployed, which is based on LD and was specially designed to control for heterogeneity in polymorphism density. Sylwester et al. (2005) . \u00fe\u00fe, the gene was among the top 30, when ranked by total memory-corrected response, over 33 seropositive subjects; \u00fe, the gene was eliciting a positive response in at least 4 of the 33 tested seropositive subjects. In contrast to Sijmons et al.'s findings, we find the majority of hyper-variable loci to be in high linkage. Specifically, within these high-LD loci, recombination between divergent genotypes is prevented, although recombination is still expected to occur between strains sharing the same genotype. Whereas occurrences of LD have previously been identified between genes of the RL11 region (Sekulin et al. 2007) , which harbors exceptionally large haplotypes ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), we here report several other loci where occurrence of LD is only evident at a scale smaller than a gene and when contrasted with the genome-wide background of essentially free recombination. Paradoxically, many of these hotspots of LD occur in genes that were associated with previous reports of absence of linkage between genes, as they are mostly hyper-variable and can be used as highly discriminant epidemiological markers (Haberland et al. 1999; Pignatelli et al. 2004; Bradley et al. 2008 ), but the presence of linkage within them has been overlooked so far.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 534, "end": 565, "text": "(Supplementary Figs.

Two-thirds of these genes have evolved multiple genotypes that are sufficiently divergent to prevent recombination between each other (Table 2) . Considering the functional annotation of these genes, most (24/31) of the high-LD genes are annotated as membrane glycoproteins that are either known or predicted to be involved in virus entry or immune evasion (Table 2 ). In addition, 10/31 harbor T-cell epitopes (Fig. 3A , track 2; Table 2 ), as previously determined by a systematic experimental scan (Sylwester et al. 2005) . Functions implying protein-protein interaction with host factors and/or having antigenic status are suggestive of co-evolutionary dynamics driving the diversification of these proteins. In nine of these genes, phylogenetic analysis revealed evidence of past and present positive selections, which likely accounts for this extreme divergence (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4 ). For these nine positively selected hyper-variable genes, which include antigenic viral proteins like UL55/gB, this pattern is highly suggestive of selective pressure for escape of the host immune system driving sequence diversification. Causes of diversification of other hyper-variable proteins are less obvious, and may involve more complex scenarios. For instance RL11 gene family members encode putative glycoproteins (both membrane and cytosolic, Gabaev et al. 2011 ) that can impact virus growth in a cell type-specific manner, manipulate leukocyte adhesion and cytokine production (via interaction with CD229) or bind to immunoglobulin-Fc receptors postulated to contribute to epithelial cell tropism in vivo (Lilley et al. 2001; Atalay et al. 2002; Engel et al. 2011) . As these proteins bind host receptors that are themselves polymorphic, negative frequency-dependent selection for a tighter interaction with the variety of ligands available in the host population could be driving their diversification. Another known cause of the emergence of LD is the competition for resources such as cellular receptors among co-infecting strains, promoting a stably diverse population of pathogens (Watkins et al., 2014) ; this mechanism promoting population structure is, however, expected to lead to long-range linkage among loci, which is not observed here (apart for the RL11 locus, see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 670, "text": "(Sylwester et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1519, "text": "Gabaev et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1785, "text": "(Lilley et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1805, "text": "Atalay et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1824, "text": "Engel et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2268, "text": "(Watkins et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 143, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 280, "end": 289, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 503, "end": 511, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 557, "end": 565, "text": "(Fig. 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 577, "end": 584, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1045, "text": "(Supplementary Tables S2 and S4", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Islands of linkage arise by fast evolution under diversifying selection or slow evolution under putative epistatic constraints"}, {"text": "LD hotspots were also present within ten genes (including UL75/gH, UL86/MCP, UL100/gM, UL104, and UL123/IE1) that are more conserved among HCMV strains, with an average nucleotide diversity only marginally higher than the genomic average ( Supplementary Fig. S11 ). For these, lack of recombination cannot be explained by between-genotype nucleotide divergence, and we speculate that in these genes linkage may preserve key protein functions that rely on crucial intra-genic epistasis. In the case of UL86 and UL104, both capsid proteins, it seems plausible that strong conformational constraints in these proteinsfor which stability is essential for virion formation and transmissibility -may lead to such strong selection for co-evolution of interacting residues that linkage between them could be maintained even in face of the high recombination rate.

This supports a history of repeated co-speciation of virus and hosts, during which the RL11 gene family expanded and evolved rapidly in a continuous process of diversification since the early CMV ancestor (Fig. 2B) .

The common feature of this gene family is the RL11 core domain (RL11D), which shares homology with the adenovirus E3 family of proteins (Davison et al. 2003; Gabaev et al. 2011) which are important for evasion of T-cell responses and inhibition of cell death. This putative function, in addition to the characterized roles of individual proteins in cell tropism, would further implicate the RL11 region as a crucial region for HCMV replication in vivo, notably through specific interactions with human receptors. Therefore, we hypothesize that the RL11 gene family diversification has been an important driver of adaptive co-evolution of HCMV genomes within their hosts. From this perspective, the presence of divergent genotypes at this locus having lost the ability to recombine with each other, while free recombination is still occurring in the rest of the genome, is indicative of population differentiation occurring within HCMV species.

This high degree of conservation at the protein level is likely due to the strong purifying selection experienced by all protein-coding genes in the genome over most of their phylogenetic history ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Genome-wide purifying selection is common in viral pathogens (Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2011; Wertheim et al. 2013; Cloete et al. 2014; Duch\u00eane et al. 2014) , indicating strong and long-standing evolutionary constraint on the encoded proteome. In HCMV, such constraint might be explained by the long co-evolution with its host: herpesviruses have co-evolved over long periods of time with their specific host (McGeoch et al. 1995; Wertheim et al. 2014 ) -in the case of CMVs with no evidence of further introductions since the last primate ancestor (Fig. 2C ). With such extended time periods under constant ecological conditions, the HCMV genome is likely close to encode an optimal phenotype, characterized by a life cycle of asymptomatic reactivation and transmission. This lifestyle necessitates a large apparatus of regulators and immune escape factors that constitute as many mutation targets.

This common evolutionary trade-off is emphasized in HCMV by the extreme dichotomy of evolutionary rates observed in the genome, with the few loci under strong positive selection for frequent change being at risk of recurrently hitch-hiking deleterious mutations in the large remainder of the genome under purifying selection.
