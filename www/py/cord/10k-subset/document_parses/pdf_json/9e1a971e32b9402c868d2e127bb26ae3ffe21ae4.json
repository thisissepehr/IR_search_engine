However, the degree of protection is not very well characterized and appears to be of short duration. Under conditions in which susceptible and infectious pigs are mixed, e.g. at weaning, a large proportion of the population may quickly become infected. Dee and Joo (1994b) reported 80-100% of pigs in 3 swine herds were infected by 8-9 weeks-of-age. In a study of 20 herds, Mateusen et al., (2002) found a seroprevalence of 40% at 10 weeks-of-age, and that the seroprevalence continued to increase up to 24 weeks of age. This denotes a considerable occurrence of PRRS transmission in the nursery unit. Maes (1997) found 96% of market hogs sampled from 50 herds to be positive. However, the pattern of infection in PRRS virus-endemic herds often deviates from this description of rapid, uniform spread. For example Dewey et al., (2004) found that in 1 out of 8 farms, only around 12% of the nursery pigs were infected by the age of 11 weeks. Within infected herds, marked differences in infection rates between groups, pens, or rooms of animals are often observed. Houben et al., (1995b) found transmission to vary even within litters with some littermates seroconverting as early as 6-8 weeks and other individuals as late as 10-12 weeks-of-age. In some cases, litters of pigs reached 12 weeks-of-age, the end of the monitoring period, still free of PRRSv infection. Thus, it is possible for animals in endemically infected herds to escape infection for an extended period of time, as when Le Potier et al., (1997) reported seroconversion in young sows on farms using in-herd gilt replacements. Dee et al., (1996) concluded that the presence of susceptible animals in breeding herds provided a mechanism to maintain persistent viral transmission in chronically-infected farms. The general picture is that PRRS virus infects weaners at an age of 5-to 12 weeks. By the end of the finishing period, most pigs are usually seropositive. For example, Mortensen et al., (2001) found that 83% of the animals in 1,603 infected herds were seropositive. However, the proportion of infected weaners varies between herds (Dewey et al., 2004) . Chung et al., (2005) monitored pigs from 7 farrow-to-finish continuous pig herds for PRRS. Each herd contained 2,000-2,500 sows, and about 70% of the sows were reported to be seropositive. The pigs were monitored every second week from 2 to 22 weeks of age. They were weaned at 4 weeks of age, moved to growing houses at 8 to 9 weeks of age and then to finishing houses at 18 to 19 weeks of age. PRRS virus was isolated from serum collected from 1-to 16-week-old pigs. The highest isolation rates were from pigs 6 to 9 weeks of age. Virus was not isolated from serum when pigs were 22 weeks of age. The infection pattern in the 7 herds was similar; therefore, the results were combined and can be seen in Table 2 -2.

A first PRRSv receptor was identified by generation of two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), which were able to block PRRSv infection (Duan et al., 1997b) . A protein with a molecular weight of approximately 210-kDa was precipitated by these Mabs. This protein was recognised as the porcine homologue of mouse and human sialoadhesins (Vanderheijden et al., 2003) . Delputte et al., (2002) showed that addition of heparin or heparan sulfate, or heparinase treatment of alveolar macrophages, clearly reduced PRRSv infection, indicating that PRRSv binds to cell surface heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Recent data showed that the attachment of PRRSv to its host cell is initiated by an unstable binding of the virus to heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans and is finalized by a stable binding of the virus to sialoadhesin (Delputte et al., 2005) . Following binding to the cellular receptors, virus particles become internalized by a microfilament-dependent process through small clathrin-like coated vesicles. During this stage, an acidic pH is required to trigger fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane allowing the viral nucleocapsid to enter the cytoplasm for replication . Newly produced viral antigens are detected within the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages as soon as 6 hours after inoculation. From this time on, the nucleocapsid buds at the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum . Virions seem to mature between the endoplasmatic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, since budding and accumulation of enveloped virus particles can only be observed between these organelles (Dea et al., 2000) . PRRSv may be released by exocytosis or by cell lysis. One replication cycle of PRRSv takes about 9 to 12 hours .

Under natural circumstances, the virus most frequently enters via the respiratory tract, but viraemia and dissemination throughout the body rapidly occur. The kinetics of a PRRSv infection in the lungs and lymphoid organs (see Figure  3 -1) have been described in detail by several authors (Duan et al., 1997b; Beyer et al., 2000; Labarque et al., 2000) . In these studies, inoculation with PRRSv rapidly resulted in viraemia and virus replication in several organs. From 2 to 4 days after inoculation onwards, it was possible to isolate PRRSv from lungs, tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen and blood. The highest virus titres in tonsils and lungs were reached at 9-14 days after inoculation, whereas the highest virus titres in lymph nodes were reached at 3 days after inoculation. From tonsils, lymph nodes and thymus, virus isolation was possible up to 21 days after inoculation; from lungs infectious virus was recovered until 35 days after inoculation. PRRSv-infected cells were mostly located in the alveolar spaces of the lungs and in germinal centres of lymphoid follicles in lymph nodes and spleen. Cell-free viraemia was detected until 21 to 28 days after inoculation. The latter finding was confirmed by other groups (Halbur et al., 1996a, b; Wills et al., 1997b) . However, extended periods of viraemia, of up to 5-9 weeks duration has also been reported Bilodeau et al., 1994; Sur et al., 1997) . During viraemia, the virus may be distributed to various organs. The course of infection may be modulated by age at infection and maternal immunity. PRRSv can be detected in muscle in 60% of infected animals with peak titres at day 11 of between 10 3.3 and 10 4.3 TCID 50 /g, with a detection limit of 10 1.8 TCID 50 /g (Steverinck, 1999) . In boars, the virus may infect the male reproductive tract and be shed in semen (Swenson et al., 1994b; Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995a) . In pregnant sows, PRRSv is able to cross the placenta. However, the efficiency by which PRRSv crosses the placenta depends on the stage of gestation. At early-and mid-gestation, transplacental infection is rarely observed Mengeling et al., 1994) .

It is remarkable that only 2% of the alveolar macrophages, which are the main target cells in vivo, become infected, even at the peak of virus replication in the lungs (Mengeling et al., 1995; Duan et al., 1997b) .

There is some conflicting data about the exact duration and site of PRRSv replication during the persistent stage.

In studies by Duan et al., (1997b) and Beyer et al., (2000) , lungs and alveolar macrophages were the only tissues in which PRRSv was persistently detected for 35 days after inoculation.

They demonstrated that alveolar macrophages obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage were virus-positive up to days 49 or 70 after inoculation. Other studies also suggest persistence of infectious PRRSv in lymphoid organs, especially in the tonsils.

Both the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay and the indirect immunofluorescence assay can however be designed with both PRRSv types.
