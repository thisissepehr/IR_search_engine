With the explosion of genetically engineered mice (GEM), new concerns over the impact of microbial agents have emerged because these rodents in many cases are more susceptible to disease than their inbred or outbred counterparts. Moreover, interaction between microbe and host and the resulting manifestation of disease conceivably differ between GEM and their inbred and outbred counterparts. As a result, infections may alter the GEM phenotype and confound interpretation of results and conclusions about mutated gene function. In addition, because GEM are expensive to produce and maintain, contamination by pathogens or opportunists has severe economic consequences. This review addresses how microbial infections may influence phenotype, how immunomodulation of the host as the result of induced mutations may modify host susceptibility to microbial infections, how novel host:microbe interactions have led to the development of new animal models for disease, how phenotype changes have led to the discovery of new pathogens, and new challenges associated with prevention and control of microbial infections in GEM.

Infections that result in premature death or clinical signs of disease have obvious impact on phenotype and research using contaminated animals. In other cases, infections may be subclinical but alter the normal microscopic anatomy of infected animals. Subclinical infections also pose a significant risk to the research conducted with affected animals because they can alter the physiology (notably immune function) of experimental subjects or experimental endpoints such as tumor kinetics. These adverse effects have been summarized in a number of reviews (Baker 1998 (Baker , 2003 Lipman and Perkins 2002; Nicklas et al. 1999; NRC 1991) .

Alteration of phenotype may occur with microbes that are known to cause disease (pathogens) or with opportunists. In this article, the definition of opportunist proposed by Smith (1998) is used-an organism capable of causing disease only in a host whose resistance is lowered, for example by other diseases, drugs, or genetic manipulation.

Moreover, differential susceptibilities to infectious disease among inbred strains are commonplace and in many situations may be due to abnormal immune responses. For example, natural killer cell deficiencies in SJL mice, complement component 5 deficiencies in A, AKR, DBA/2, and SWR mice, and tolllike receptor 4 deficiencies in C3H/HeJ mice may render these mice susceptible to some infectious diseases (Barthold 2002; Poltorak et al. 1998) . Differential susceptibility may also result from differences in host receptors utilized by pathogens. For example, SJL mice possess a different allelic form of the MHV receptor, rendering them resistant to infections by this virus compared with other strains of mice (Nedellec et al. 1994; Ohtsuka et al. 1996) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 158, "text": "[SCID 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 290, "end": 309, "text": "[Keely et al. 2004]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 846, "end": 861, "text": "(Barthold 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 862, "end": 883, "text": "Poltorak et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1175, "text": "(Nedellec et al. 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1196, "text": "Ohtsuka et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microbial Influence on Phenotype"}, {"text": "Based on the susceptibility of immunodeficient and inbred mice to certain infections, it is reasonable to anticipate that mice with induced mutations (i.e., knockout mice) in immune system effector molecules may also be more susceptible to the same infections, and when infected, their phenotype may be markedly altered. Examples abound, as do the types of pathogens involved in these novel host:microbe relationships. Many of the pathogens discussed in the following paragraphs and listed in Table 1 are indeed prevalent in contemporary colonies, including P. carinii, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Staphylococcus aureus, MHV, minute virus of mice (MVM 1 ), Syphacia spp., and Helicobacter spp. (Jacoby and Lindsey 1998; Livingston and Riley 2003) . It should not be assumed that less common agents not discussed (e.g., Sendai virus) do not have the potential to alter phenotype. Numerous studies have used experimentally infected GEM as tools in the study of the biology of murine pathogens, and these mice often exhibit increased susceptibility to infections and altered phenotypes as the result of these infections. Thus, the lack of reports on certain agents may reflect the low occurrence of these infections in contemporary colonies rather than their inability to alter phenotype. Nine characteristics of microbial infections are listed in Table 2 . In the text below, these characteristics are discussed with regard to the following: how microbial infections may influence phenotype, how immunomodulation of the host as the result of induced mutations may modify host susceptibility to microbial infections, how novel host:microbe interactions have led to the development of new animal models for disease, and how phenotype changes have led to the discovery of new pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 693, "end": 718, "text": "(Jacoby and Lindsey 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 719, "end": 745, "text": "Livingston and Riley 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 500, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1351, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Microbial Influence on Phenotype"}, {"text": "Characteristic 1: Opportunist infections of GEM may result in diseases similar to those seen in spontaneously mutated immunodeficient mice. P. carinii is a well-defined pathogen of T-cell-deficient, nude, and T-and B-cell-deficient SCID mice. Infections in these mice result in alveolitis characterized by the filling of alveoli by foamy exudate that contains abundant organisms and few host inflammatory cells (primarily macrophages) (Percy and Barthold 2001b) . The life span of these mice is in turn shortened, and their utility in certain studies (i.e., those involving the respiratory tract) is severely compromised. P. carinii has also emerged as a problematic opportunist in GEM (Furuta et al. 2001; Macy et al. 2000; Marcotte et al. 1996) . This development is likely due to its prevalence in colonies of immunocompetent mice and the fact that many GEM have predicted or unpredicted defects in immune responses. Recently, P. carinii exudative alveolitis, similar to that seen in SCID and nude mice, was identified in CD40 ligand (CD40L) knockout mice (Furuta et al. 2001) . CD40L is expressed on T cells, and engagement with CD40 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs 1 ) and B cells re-sults in activation of both T and B cells (Grewal et al. 1997) . Experimental studies have demonstrated the critical role of both B and T cell activation as well as other cellular interactions (i.e., T cell: APC) via CD40:CD40L interactions in defense against P. carinii (Lund et al. 2003; Wiley and Harmsen 1995) .

An outbreak or P. pneumotropica conjunctivitis was also reported in mice transgenic for carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM 1 )-1. Ceacam1 is the gene encoding a signaling receptor that is implicated in several physiological functions, including immune functions (Markel et al. 2004; Schmitter et al. 2004; Skubitz et al. 2001 ). In addition, Ceacam1 serves as a receptor for a number of bacterial and viral pathogens (Hill et al. 2005; Zelus et al. 2003) .

This uncertainty highlights that care should be taken when establishing the role of an infectious agent in any phenotype alteration, including those seen in GEM.

Notably, nude mice can develop folliculitis and furunculosis of the muzzle leading to coalescing abscess formation often referred to as botryomycosis (Percy and Barthold 2001a) . Likewise, certain strains of GEM have been found to have an increased incidence of staphylococcal botryomycosis. As an example, mice deficient in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA 1 ) have been reported to develop staphylococcal folliculitis (Shapiro et al. 1997) . uPA catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which functions as a broad-spectrum serine protease with many functions, including inflammation modulation. The specific role of uPA in the response (immune and non-immune mediated) to bac-terial infection has not been defined. The authors speculated that deficiency in uPA may have resulted in alterations of the local microenvironment of the skin, possibly through a general reduction in the activation or availability of cytokine growth factors. This altered microenvironment in turn facilitated bacterial invasion and infection. Botryomycotic lesions have also been seen in mice deficient in linker of activation of T cells (LAT 1 ) (J. M. Ward, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, September 2003) . Given that LAT is important in T cell activation (Abass and Lichtman 2003a) and that T cell-deficient nude mice are susceptible to botryomycosis, it is not surprising that mice deficient in LAT would develop a similar condition.

In this case, several 3-to 10-wk-old NOD.Cg-H2 H4 -Igh-6\u2212/\u2212 mice presented with lethargy, hunched posture, and runting and died ( Figure 3A ) (Naugler et al. 2001) . Wild-type mice and mice heterozygous for the Igh-6 mutation as well as several strains with mutations in other immune effector molecules were unaffected. These colonies historically had endemic MVM and mouse parvovirus (MPV 1 ) infections. Histological examination of tissues from affected knockout mice revealed large intranuclear inclusions in mononuclear cells of the bone marrow and spleen ( Figure 3B ). Using agent-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR 1 ) assays, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were found to be positive for MVM in all animals and MPV in some animals. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated that inclusions contained 20-nm virions that were positive for the nonstructural parvoviral protein NS-1 and the viral protein 2 capsid antigen of MVM ( Figure 3B ). The clinical disease in affected mice was subsequently linked to anemia and leukopenia, suggesting that the MVM (possibly in conjunction with MPV) had infected hematopoietic progenitor cells in the spleen and bone marrow.

Although there are many plausible explanations for this discrepancy, one pos-sibility is that the flora of these mice differed in comparison with mice used in previous studies.
