Janzing: Leuven/BE Introduetlon: First we did a retrospective study about lindings in acute aChillestendonruptures during US and operation. We searched for possible reasons which could explain the differences (partial/subtotal/complete rupture). After 1 year we did a second study of new patients and improved our number of correct diagnoses. Material and methods: First we reviewed the US and operation records of 55 patients. Conclusions were made. Secondly we reviewed the US and operation records of 17 new patients. Results: There were differences between the number of partial, subtotal and complete ruptures on US and during operation. In the first study 56 % of diagnoses on US were correct and the entity of partial (2/55) and subtotal (2/55) rupture was far less common than presumed: 51/55 were complete ruptures. After comparing the findings during US and operation some conclusions were made. So we could improve the number of correct diagnoses on US with more than 25 %. Coneluslon: 1) The image of a partially ruptured achillestendon can be partially explained by the presence of an intact plantaris longus tendon: 2) even with the impression of so me remaining achillestendonfibers, the diagnosis of a complete rupture must be made: 3) passive flexion and extension of the foot can help in defining a partial rupture from a complete one.",

Method8 and materla18: Twenty-five patients suffering from knee trauma with impression 01 meniseal andlor ligamentous tear were selected and preoperative ultrasonography of the knee was performed using a high resolution ultrasound unrt (Aloka SSD-t 700. with 7.5 MHz linear and 5 MHz convex transducers). The radiologist was blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Sonographie diagnosis was compared with linal diagnosis at arthroscopy or arthrotomy. Re8uh8: The sensitivity of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of a tear of the medial meniseus was 93 % and of the lateral meniscus 77.7 %. The specificity was 77 .7 % and 93.7 % for medial and lateral menisci respectively. Tha overall accuracy 01 ultrasonography in the diagnosis of meniscal tear was 88 % for both menisei. The positive predictive value was 88 % for each meniscus. The negative predictive values were 87.5 % and 88.5 % for medial and lateral menisei respectively. Of the total 5 cases of Anterior Cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. one case of acute ACL tear was diagnosed by ultrasonography, but ultrasonography was negative in the other 4 cases (80 %) who had chronic or subacute ACL injuries. Conclu810n: Ultrasonography is an easy, inexpensive. dynamic imaging modality in the evaluation of traumatic meniscal injuries and acute ACL injury 01 the knee. Introductlon: Malnutrition manifests frequently as imbalance in body cornposition and provokes an inappropriate, reduction in lean body mass, visceral cell mass or both. Critically ill and severely injured patients are at higher risk for developing malnutrition. However, an absolutely reliable and consistent method for nutritional status estimation has not been developed yel. Purpo8e: The aim 01 our study was to provide an objective, reliable, repeatable and ace urate method lor nutrition al status evaluation by estimating muscular mass and amount of subcutaneous lat in patients 01 Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patlent8 and methode: Forty three patients, 16 females (mean age 61,63:1:8 years) and 27 males (mean age 50,7:1:9 years) were studied. All subjects were patients of our ICU suffering trom various diseases. Thirteen ot them were multi trauma, 4 patients suffering from brain injuries, 11 from cerebral stroke, 8 from respiratory insufficiency, 3 from tetraparesis due to C3-C4 fracture, 3 Irom hypoxemie encephalopathy and 1 trom septic shock. Throughout hospitalization all patients were supported by parenteral nutrition wrth 1800-2400 kcaVday intake and were also under physical therapy for 60 minlday. Except 10 01 tham, all the others were under musele relaxation treatment lor 4:1:2 days and under drug sedation musele treatment lor 7:1:3 days. All patients underwent an ultrasonographie examination tWlce. while they entered and exit the study. Scans were performed by the same ultrasonographer. A 10 MHz frequency high resolution transducer was held longitudinally to the biceps brachialis musele in tta place of maximum thickness. The thickness of the biceps brachialis musele as weil as subcutaneous fat were recorded. Serum Albumin levels as weil as serum Creatine Phosphokinase levels were also recorded twice. Re8ulls: Our patients were dived into two groups (A and B) according to serum Albumin (Alb) levels. In group A we observed decreased Alb levels (36,6 to 27,96 U/L P \" 0,0001) as weil as decreased subcutaneous lat (0,44 to 0,27 cm p < 0,01) thickness and biceps brachialis thickness (2, 53 to 1,99 cm p -.: 0,0001).

Ultrasonographie measurements, while having all the advantages 01 the anthropometrie measurements, ean also overeome their inherent errors. We believe that luture is even more promising in the evaluation of nutritional status in eritical ill patients with ultrasonography. Purpose: To evaluate the US features of arthritis activity in various affected joints in earlier and late stage of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and juvenile chronic polyarthritis (JChA) and to determine the effectiveness 01 general and loeal treatment of affected joint by usa ge of ultrasound contrast media 01 second generation in children 3-18 years 01 age . Materials and mathods: 52 patients (and about 320 joints) with la te trauma, clinical leatures of JRA. JChA were examined by USo In 8 patients there were no laboratory data 01 arthritis activity. All joints were examined by gray-scale USo color Doppler mapping, power Doppler on an Acuson 128-XP unit with 7.5 MHz linear probe as sereening.

(2) The quantitative evaluation was done using ROI derived data and qualitative by blinded reader analysis. Results: Quantitative analysis reveals a fairly linear dose response . The best score for confidence in tumor detection was found with Gd-SOPTA at 0.1 mmol/kg bw. The highest dose reveals a substantial increase in unspecific breast parenchymal uptake. Comparing the 0.1 mmoVkg doses of Gd-SOPTA and Gd-DTPA. a significant (p . 0.04) bener confidence in tumor detection was found lor Gd-SOPTA in the blinded reads. corresponding with higher contrast uptake. which seems to be due to the h'gher relaxivity.

Methods and materials: In the interim about 15 adult women with a benign or malignant lesion by conventional imaging were examined using T2-weighted conventional imaging in coronal view (TR 5.500 ms; TE 20 ms; TA 4:07 min) and Tlweighted dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging in coronal view (FLASH 3D: 64 partitions: TR 8.1 ms: TE 4.0 ms; flip angle 20\u00b7 ) before and for 10 min after intravenous administration of 0.15 mmollkg Gd-DTPA (temp .. res. 60 s).

Resutts: The perfusion imaging can direetly measured after a Tl -weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Normal breast parenchyma in younger women showes in more than 60 % one ore more rapid enhancing lesions. Most of the mammographically benign lesions enhanced significantly. No ore only minor perfusion effeet were documented in these benign fibroadenomas or mastopathia. We found a susceptibility-mediated signal intensity loss in carcinomas with a strong enhancement on Tl -weighted images. Concluaion: MR imaging may provide valuable additional information in suspected findings in mammography. There are problems in differentiation of rapidly enhancing benign lesions e.g. juvenile fibroadenomas and (higher grade) mastopathy from malignancies. Here first-pass perfusion imaging proves worth with the correct dividing into benign and malignant lesions.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injected with NM DA (200 nmol/I'I) In striatum or hippocampus. A neuroprotective drug. AIT-082, (400 nmoVI'I) was coinjected with the excitotoxin NMDA. The induced lesions were monitored Irom two to ni ne days after the inlection, by using a commercial MAI scanner (Vision. Siemens), operating at 1.5 Tesla. A linear polarized wrap around surtace coil was used to obtain T2 TSE brain images. Six 3 mm thick transverse slices were acquired in less than 8 min (TA 7400 ms: TE 115 ms: matrix 483,,1024: FOVs 200-250 mm). Finally, MAI findings were compared with histology (cresyl violet). The NMDA-induced lesions were identitied as hyperintensities that gradually decreased. The MAllesions were compared to diseased areas as shown by histology (Ioss of neurons and gliosis). AIT-082 caused a signilicant reduction 01 the lesions extent, preventing neuronal damage. In conclusion: MAI (1.5 T) appeared an uselul, noninvasive technique to evaluate experimental neurotoxic damage, as weil as acute local lesions in clinical praclice. Purpose: T1 and T2 relaxation times depend on MA field strength and on the type 01 MA scanner. We will attempt to demonstrate that MAI is an excellent technique lor assessing endocrine orbitopathy provided technical conditions are taken into account. Materials and methods: We have tested 12 normal subjects and 7 patients with Graves's ophtalmopathy on a Philips 0.5 T MA scanner. TI and T2 relaxation times in our study have been compared to those described in the literature lor a Toshiba and lor a Siemens scanner. We have also measured values 01 signal intensity ratio (SIA) in both groups. This study has allowed us to set standards 01 relerence lor relaxation times and SIR lor a Philips 0.5 T MA scanner. Coneluslons: MAI seems to be the best modality to assess pathological infiltration 01 extraocular muscles provided that reference values for TI and T2 relaxation and SIA are known for a given MA scanner.

It is unclear whether the perirenal spaces communicate across the midline and whether they communicate with the pelvis. We used helical CT and contrast medium (CM) injections into cadavers, to clarify these Issues. Materials and methodS: Helical CT was used to guide the inlection 01100,200, and 300 mls 01 dilute contrast material into the left perirenal space 01 lour cadavers (M:F = 2:3) and the right perirenal space in one (after lailed injections of the left perirenal space). Contiguous 3 mm images (pitch 01 1.0) were acqUlfed of the abdomen and pelvis alter each injection. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions and source images were reviewed by three experienced body imagers and the anatomic communications 01 the perirenal space recorded lor each patient. Results: In lour cadavers the left perirenal space was shown to communicate with the contra lateral pararenal space via a conduit anterior to the aona and the IVC after injection of 100 mls of CM. In the patient who had a right perirenal space injection CM flowed f,om the right perirenal space to fill Morrison's pouch but did not cross the midline. lind in 4 patients. An angiomyolipoma (AMl) was lound in one patient. Aenal cysts (one simple. one bilobulated. one multilobulated) were lound in 3 patients. Typical enhancement patterns were eS1ablished lor renal cell carcinoma (maximal en\u00b7 haneement in the first minute after Gd\u00b7DTPA administration). transitional cell carcinoma. and normal renal medulla (maximal enhancemenl in the 2\u00b74 minute after Gd-DTPA administration). No significant enhancement was observed in the cysts. In 34/36 operated pathologieal masses (26 renal cell carcinomas. 4 transi\u00b7 tional cell carcinomas and 3 cysts) the information obtained using our method was either equivalent or superior to the USo CT and IVU techniques. The IVU was negative or equivocal in 6 cases of ACC and in 3 cases of renal eysts. The US was negative or equivocal in 5 cases of ACC and in 3 cases 01 renal cysts. CT was equivocal in 1 case of ACC. We misdiagnosed an AMl with predominance 01 muscle cells as a renal cell carcinoma (in this case the CT diagnosis was also renal eell carcinoma. while the US diagnosis was in favor 01 an AMl). We overlooked arenal cell carcinoma in a cyst wall. The thickness 01 the tumor tissue was. however. only 3 mm. and the thickened wall of the cyst was reported. Purpose: To evaluate the use of thin-collimation multi slice CT (MSCT) lor a comprehensive preoperative diagnosis in patients with renal cell carcinoma (ACC). Material and methods: 30 patients with ACC preoperatively underwent digital subtraction angiography and MSCT (Siemens VZ). The MSCT scan protocol con\u00b7 sisted in a pre-contrast scan followed by arterial phase acquisition with 4~1\u00b7mm collimation and parenchymal phase acquisition with 4x2.5\u00b7mm collimation. 80th contrast acquisitions were performed with 500 ms rotation and piteh 6. Aecon\u00b7 structed slice thicknesses were 1.25 mm (arterial). 3 mm (parenchymal) and 5 mm (pre-contrast. arterial and parenchymal) to allow lor both. volume-rendered 3D and 20 image interpretation. Reaulta: Our MSCT scan protocol allows lor excellent and consistent arterial enhancement with optimal contrast use. Despite of the high acqulsition speed. the high spatial resolution enables clear and consistent identHication of small vessels (i.e. segmental arteries). This way. the relationship of the tumour to the vessels. the collecting system and the central sinus lat can be determined. as a prerequisite for successful complete and tlssue\u00b7sparing resectlon. Concluaiona: The high speed and spatial resolution of MSCT allow lor an aecurate evaluation 01 vascular and parenchymal anatomy. Thus. MSCT is a valuable guidance tool for pre-surgical planning in patients with ACC.",

For a glven number 01 visible lesions, the direct detector system required on the average 45 % less dose than the ST V plates when 20 cm acrylic glass was superimposed . The potential dose reduction was less with decreasing simulated soft tissue thickness and lower kVp (38 % al 10 cm and 17% at 5cm). Concluslon: Direct delector radiography provides improved low-contrast resolution compared to storage phosphor plates. The diHerences 01 dose requirements increase with stronger scaner and higher kVp.

Discusslon: Aadiography can image complications of VGB. However. barium studies cannot detect consistently early leaks. and CT is needed in these cases. Aadiography can also provide functional evaluation. showing that factors other than delayed emptying and satiety limes are involved in weight control after VGB. Further follow-up is needed to elucidate the possible clinical significance of the pseudodiverticular images seen in some 01 our cases.",

Materials and methods: We reviewed the radiographic findings in 4 patients with ASGB who had surgically proven gastric band erosion into the stomach . Three had a barium study shortly belore band removal : one a plain abdominal lilm only. Imaging was correlated to clinical history. presenting symptoms and previous radiographie studies. Results: Two patients had a normally closed band : It was displaced caudally in comparison with prevlous lilms. and barium was not Ilowing though its lumen only. but also around it. The other two had an open band. One had the band at the duodenal-jejunal junction. with the connection to the subcutaneous port running along the course of the duodenum. The other had an open band within the stomach which could not be located on both plain lilms and barium studies. Patients had vomiting. unexplained weight gain. or loss 01 sense 01 satiety: none had acute symptoms. Concluslons: Aadiologists need to be lamiliar with complicatlons of ASGB. Band erosion into the gastric lumen IS a severe. posslbly lile-threatening problem which needs band removal and has to be properly recognlzed. From 1995 From -1998 were referred from Department 01 Surgery with the diagnosIs 01 enterocutaneous fistulae for further evaluation. Acontrast sinogram was obtalned (Siregraph D. Siemens) after inserting a silicon catheter in the opening of I,stula and by inlection 01 a watersolubte contrast agent (300 mg/mi lopamidol) in the catheter. A CT-scanning (Somatom plus 4. Siemens. Erlangen) with 5 mm collimation . 5 mm table speed. and recon. Index 3 was pertormed. immediately after sinography was finished . A diluted water-soluble contrast agent (300 mg/mllopamidol t5) was inlected again in the cavity of fistula . Results: In 58 patients (90.6 %) enterocutaneous fistulae were diagnosed by both methods.ln 27 patients (47 %) CT could provide more information in comparison with the conventional method: in 9 patients ( t 5 %) . CT showed the expansion 01 fistula . in 13 patients (23 %) the anatomic relation to the other abdominal organs was clarified by CT. and in 11 patients CT revealed a lurther pathologic lesion (abscess. inflammation) in association with listula. Concluslon: The computed tomography provldes In about 50 % 01 cases increased valuable information than the conventional method does. Purpose: To verily whether the \",crease 01 mucosal coating induced by magnesium ions du ring double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) is specilically due to an the increase 01 the barium suspension viscosity. Method and materials: 161 patients subjected to the same intestinal preparation were randomised in three groups 01 23 pairs (i.e .. 138 patients) plus a control group (i.e .. 23 patients) . DCBE was performed with standard technique using a barium suspension to which MgSO, or Na,50, were extemporarily added so to obtain specilic values 01 dynamic viscosity : 320 cPs (group-l). 2500 cPs (group-2). 3000 cPs (group-3) . The basic viscosity 01 the barium suspension (control group) was 280 cPs. Three radiologists evaluated on an ordinal scale mucosal coating and Iree flUid . Results: In each group mucosal coating was more effective (p . 0.001) in the magnesium-than In the sodium-member 01 the pairs. notwithstanding the equal viscosity of the barium suspension. The best mucosal coating and the lowest free Iluid were obta\",ed in group-2. Conclusions: The better coallng 01 the mucosa obtained in presence 01 Mg-ions is not due simply to an increase of the barium suspension viscosity. but an mteraction of Mg-ions with the polysaccharide additives 01 the barium suspension should be considered.",

Methods and materials: Six experimental procedures were carried out in a domestic pig model. The mechanically ventilated pigs were aerosolized with an aqueous lormulation 01 Gd-DTPA. The contrast agent aerosol (average particle size 131-') was generated by a large volume nebulizer. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T MR imager (Philips Gyroscan ACS-NT) using a Tl-weighted turbo spin echo sequence in a single breath-hold employing a specially designed synergy surtace coil. Pulmonary signal intensities belore and after ventilation were measured in peripheral portions 01 both lungs. Results: Immediately after ventilation wlth aerosolized Gd-DTPA. the signal intensity in both lungs increased signilicantly in all animals with values up to 214 % above baseline (mean 118\u00b145 %). Parenchymal enhancement was readily visualized in all six cases. Concluslon: Delinition 01 pulmonary ventilatoon using gadolinium based contrast agents has been demonstrated beiore.

Purpose: The use of IV contrast puts patients with decreased renal function at risk of further renal impairment. The drug fenoldopam, whlch causes the vessels in the kidney to dilate. may prevent or decrease the nsk of this radlocontrastinduced renal impairment. Materials and methods: IV fenoldopam IS infused 2 hours pnor to procedure at a rate of 0.1 mcglkg/min and increased at increments of 0. 1 mcg/kg/mln every 20 minutes until a rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/min is reached.

Purpose: To summarize and compare the validity of MA-angiography, spiral CTangiography, ultrasonography and captopril renography as non-invasive diagnostic test in renovascular hypertension. Methods and materials: For each diagnostic modality, published studies were identified by a loterature search in MEDLfNE.

A standard lorm was used to extract relevant data Irom the Included studies. The accuracy data (sensitivity and speclficity) from the four different diagnostic modalities were analyzed and compared by a meta-analytic technique, known as the construction of Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (SAOC) curves. Resulls: Though all diagnostic modalities showed a great variety in accuracy dala, SROC curves found both spiral CT-angiograpy as weil as gadolinium enhanced, three-dimensional MA angiography to be the most valid tests as compared to all other studied diagnostic tests (p \" 0.05).

A comparison of volume rendering and surfaC8 rentlering 3D The purpose of the study was to investigate the value of Volume Rendering (VR) and Surtace Rendering (SR) 3D Reconstructions of data sets obtained from contrast enhanced electron beam Cl. The image quality and the diagnostic accuracy in comparison with conventional coronary angiography was analyzed. Fifty-two patients with proximal coronary artery stenosis underwent electron beam CT. Visualization of the main coronary arteries was analyzed after VR and SR 3D reconstructions for different coronary artery segments. Both reconstruction methods were compared with a 6-Point grading system . Two independent, blinded observers evaluated the VR and SR reconstructions for detection of hemodynamically significant stenosis . The mean image quality scores for the proximal. mlddle and distal segments of the coronary arteries were 3.80.3.01 and 1.33 for VR and 3.02, 2.16 and 0.75 for SR For the assessment of coronary artery stenoses sensitivity was 52 % and speciflcity was 72 ~o for VR and respectively 58 0.0 and 73 % for SR after evaluation by two obsevers. Volume Rendenng is a fast 30-reconstruction method for the continous visualizatlon of coronary arteries from multiple views without prevlous segmentation. which shows a higher image quality than surtace rendering. but a lower sensltivity in detection of stenosis. Purpose: Three-dimenslonal (3D) data for non-invasive Imaglng of the coronary arteries is acquired USlng Electron Beam Computed Tomography (EBT) . Most commonly surtace rendenng (SR) is used for 3D processing but we expect that better results can be obtained by using volume rendering (VR). Methods: Three datasets were selected for visualization using both VR and SR SRs are constructed on a Magicview workstation (Siemens Medical Systems). VRs are constructed using VoxelView 3D rendering sohware (VitalImages Inc.). Resuhs: One of the main algorithmic differences of SR and VR is the fact that SR typically uses less than 10 % of the available imaging data, while VR uses up to 100 %. This also implies that VR is more computationally expensive than SR, but due to modern ultrafast workstations this does not produce time-constraints . However, comparison of the resulting images clearly shows the shortcomings of SR compared to VR . 80th techniques require a goOO segmentation in order to be able to view the coronary arteries without other structures blocking the view. Concluslon: Our preliminary data demonstrate that VR produces better image quality than SR Large-scale studies should corroborate our initial findings.",

Resuhs: Palency 01 all 16 stenls could not be reliably evalualed due to susceptibility artilacts on CE-MAA. DU evaluated stent patency correctly in 4/5 X-ray angiographically confirmed cases.

Sardanelli : GenoailTPurpose: To test the eHect of AHSCT in treahng SSPMS using enhanced serial brain MR examlnahons with tripie dose 01 Gadohntum (Gd). Methods and materials: A baseline versus treatment design was used. Two lemale pahents alflicted with SSPMS, with 36 (Illst pahent) and 52 (second patient) years 01 age. both with a disease duralton of 6 years and an Expanded O,sability Status Scale (EOSS) of 6.5. underwent monthly MR Gd-enhanced examinahons for 6 (first patient) or 3 months (second patient) as basehne period. Stem cell mobilizahon was obtained with cyclophosphamide 4 gr/m' : conditioning w~h a BEAM regimen (BCNU 300 m9'm': Etoposide 200 m9'm' and Ara-Cy 200 m9' m' per 4 days: Melphalan 140 m9'm' ): then. reinfusion of stem cells was performed. The two patients underwent 2 (first patient) or 3 (second patient) MR examinations hmed after mobilization and before conditioning: up unlil now, the first patient had monthly MR for 6 months after AHSCT. the second one for only t month. MR examinations were pertormed at 1.5 T wlth the following protocol: 3step centenng for ophmal repositioning: 20+20 Interleaved 3 mm no gap paraaxIal slices: spin-echo Tl -weighted sequence (TRfTE = 714/ 14 ms: 2 excitations: pixel 0.96 mm' ) before and 5-8 minutes after Intravenous injechon of 0.3 mmollkg of Gadodiamide (Omniscan, Nycomed). The number of enhancing lesions was counted in a fashion blinded to the examinahon date. Results: In the first patient. the number of enhancing lesions was as folIows: 4. 4.3. 7. 8. and 29 (mean 9.2)  in the baseline period : 9 and 4 after mobilizahon and before conditioning : 1, O. O. 0, O. and 0 (mean 0.2) after AHSCl. In the second patient the number of enhanclng lesions was as folIows:15. 16. and 27 (rnean  19.3)  in the basehne period: 9. 4. and 1 after mobilizatlon and before conditloning : o after AHSCT. The treatment was weil tolerated wlth early infections treated with antibiotic therapy. Conclualon: In these two cases of SSPMS, characterized by a high dlsease activity in the baseline period, AHSCT was followed by a strong reduction 01 the number of enhancing lesions already after the intense Immunosuppression obtained with cyclophosphamide and confirmed after stem cell transplanlahon . A third fe male SSPMS pahenl with 32 years of age, 10 years of disease duration, and an EOSS of 6.5 entered the study and showed a mean of 11.4 enhancing lesions in 4 monthly MR baseline examinatlons.1169,4,5Effect of subsequent single doses of gadolinium (Gd) on leslon enhancement in braln magnetlc reaonance (MR) of multiple sclerosls (MS) C.

The elevation 01 blood flow velocity was most prominent in distal segments 01 55 nephroptotie patients with pain syndrome (135.6\u00b19.5 em/s lor elinostasis, 96.2\u00b18.7 em/s lor onhostasis), Sens./Spee.lAee. were 95 %/85 %/90 %, and in 50 hypenensive patients with nephroptosis, Sens./Spee./Acc. were 75 %/82 %/90 % . Aenal venous stenosis was revealed in 14 nephroptotie patients . Venous flow velocity was signilieantly (P , 0.05) inereased during elinostatie and onhostatie testing (main renal vein : 34 .2\u00b14.5 em/s and 29.2\u00b14.7 em/s, respeetively: venous sinuses: 34 .6\u00b16.3 em/s and 27.7\u00b12.8 em/s, respeetively) eompared with healthy persons and the contra lateral kidney (main renal anery: 22.1 \u00b14.5 em/s lor elinostasis and 18.5\u00b10.9 em/s lor onhostasis, venous sinuses: 23.0\u00b13.8 em/s lor elinoslasis and 21 .2\u00b13.9 em/s lor onhostasis) . In 35 patiens with nephroptosis and hematuria venous flow velocity was as high as 41.2\u00b19.1 em/s in the main trunk and 38.6\u00b15.7 em/s in venous sinusis poinling at eongestive venous hypenension as a eausative agent lor nephroptotie hematuria (Sens./Spee.lAee. were 93 %/70 %/ 82 %). Venous flow inerease in hypenensive patients was demonstrated in main aneries and venous sinuses 01 both kidneys only during elinostasis (main trunk: 32.6\u00b16.7 em/s, venous sinuses: 40.2\u00b1 1 0.8 em/s). Concluslon: Doppler data must be eonsidered when selecting patients lor nephropexy. TImely eorreetion 01 nephroptosis may prevent the development 01 organie anerial and venous stenosis.

Materials and methods: Twenty eonsecutive transplanted renal allogralt patients underwent 373 serial US examinations. Pulsatility index (PI) and resistive index (AI) 01 interlobular, interlobar and segmental aneries were measured in six aneries at eaeh level , three times at week during 5-9 weeks post-transplantation. Aelative and absolute PI and AI were ealeulated. Flow was delined as abnormal when PI or AI inereased 10 % more than previous examination. Aesults were eorrelated with serum ereatinine and histology. Results: There were 17 aeute rejeetions and 11 nephrotoxieity episodes eonlirmed by biopsy or elinically. Aelative PI elevation 01 interlobular aneries was the most sensitive eriteria to prediet dyslunetion (sensitivity: 96 %, PPV; 63 %). Aelative PI and AI 01 interlobar and segmental aneries had low sensitivity. Aelative PI 01 interlobular aneries inereased at least 2 days belore elevation 01 serum ereatinine in aeute releetions and 4 days belore in nephrotoxieities. Concluslon: Serial evaluation 01 Pion renal allograft improved sensitivity and accuraey lor predieting dyslunetion. Aelative Pion interlobular anery elevated earlier than serum creatinine that eould be potential criterion lor predicting allograll dyslunetion.Color Doppler US In the evaluation of norrnally functlonlng renal grafts from IIvlng donors F.M.

Passanello: Rome/IT Purposa: There is a growing interest in noninvasive studies 01 renal allogralt vaseularity due to the inereaslng number 01 renal transplants. Our aim was to examine the kidneys by Color Doppler US belore and alter transplant to assess hemodynamie changes and time 01 gralt recovery: Materials and methods: The same kidneys were studied by Color Doppler US in 48 living donors and later in the recipients, 24 hours, 3, 7 and 15 days alter the transplant. Aesistive index (AI) and morphology 01 the wavelorms were evaluated. Serum creatinine level, urea nitrogen values, blood pressure and diuresis were monitored to assess the normality 01 the graft. Results: At 24 hours, 3, 7 and 15 days the AI values were similar to those measured belore transplant. Also the wavelorm morphology was similar. Concluslons: A healthy kidney is able to restore itself very quickly in spite 01 the surgieal shock, lack 01 oxygen during the transplantation and dillerent eireulatory eonditions in the new host. Our results show that Color Doppler US is uselul in the early evaluation 01 transplant dyslunction.Autonomous perlstaltle actlvlty 0' transplant ureters proved by color Doppler mapplng 0' the jet phenomenon U.

Materials and methods: Ouring aperiod of 6 months, CT scans were consecu\u00b7 tively performed on 68 hospitalised patients aged over 75 years (mean 83.3%5.3), wilh IV contrast media (lobitridoI300) at mean dose of 1.64%0.33 ml/kg. Nine RRF were systematically noted. Creatininemia (Cr) levels were measured 2.4%2.8 days before and 2.8%1.7 days after CT scan, and then Creatininemia Clearance (CrCI) was calculated with the Cockroft's curve. A decrease of 25 % CrCl was consid\u00b7 ered to be a significant contrast nephrotoxicity. A mulli\u00b7variate analysis of FFR was calculated to determine potential HRsG. Results: The mean CrCl variation observed in these patients was +6 %. There was a mean of 2.6 RRF in each patient. Two patients had a Slgnificant decrease in CrCl (34 % and 28\u00b0;'). wh ich spontaneously resolved and they have respectively 5 and4 RRF. Concluslon: A moderate dose of IV non\u00b7ionic contrast media can be safely used in elderty patients.

Methods and materials: 59 patients with coronary heart disease (51 men) under\u00b7 went EBT prior to conventional coronary angiography. Patlents were randomly studled with loversol (Optiray. monomenc, 320 mg I/ml, n = 29) or lodixanol (Visipaque, dimeric, 320 mg IIml, n = 30) . Volume and flow rate were individually adapted to the body surface (120-190ml. 3.0-4 .8 mlls: InjeC!lon time 40s). 60 ECG-tnggered slices were acqUired (slice thickness 3 mm. Increment 2 mm). The denslty in the aorta was measured. Examinations were subdlvided Into 4 intervals of 15 scans each . The area under curve was determined. Three bllnded radiologists qualitatively assessed shaded surface display reconstructions of the coranary arteries. Wilcoxon's test was used for statlshcal evaluation .Resulta: The median blood density of scans 1-15, 16-30, 31-45 and 46-60 lor    loversol and lodixanol was 317 and 293 (p < 0.01),334 and 309 (p < 0.01). 281 and 291 , 190 and 195 HU (both not significant). respectively. No significant dillerence was found between the 30\u00b7reconstructions of the contrast agenls.

Robert, O. ~, C.A. Cuenod, N. Siauve, A. Sobotka, E. Kahn. G. Frija;Purpose: To study functional parameters of implanled tumors such as blood volume (BV), capi/lary permeability (kes) and tumor perfusion (TP) using spiral Computed Tomography (CT) and iodinated contrast agents. Materials and methods: S4T sarcoma was implanled in the flank of WAG rals. Images including the tumor and a reference blood vessel were acquired du ring the first pass of a bolus 1.5 ml/kg P743, a prototype macromolecular agent (Guerbet) with a rapid renal clearance. Temporal resolution du ring the first pass was 0.3 s. Then, images were acquired every minute lor 20\u00b725 minutes. 1 ml/kg lohexol 300 (Nycomed-Hamersham) was then injecled and the same imaging protocol was used. A compartmental analysis using the Patlak model allowed lor the calculation of Ihe blood volume (BV), capillary permeabillty (kes) and tumor perfusion (TP). Another original approach using a mathematical deconvolution method was devel\u00b7 oped under the IOL language to calculate the mean transit time (Mn) and tumor perfusion (TP). The same tumor model was studied using intravital videomicroscopy during the injection and FITC-Iabelled albumin and using the Patlak analysis. Results: Three tumorous zones could be identified with the lunctional parameters: . the periphery, with high perfusion and permeability indexes, the central necrotic zone with low perfusion and permeabillty indexes and an intermediate zone. The macromolecular agent P743 had lower kes and Mn than iohexol. The two fi\u00abing models gave similar resulls for the perfusion indexes. Videomicroscopy allowed to see important dillerences in morphology and perfusion between close tumorous capillary. Concluslon: Functional imaging of the tumors is feasible using spiral CT and iodinated contrast agents with reproducible quantitative resulls and a very high temporal resolution allowing for a good sampling 01 the first pass.MRA wlth a new blood pool contrast agent: Phase I cllnlcal trial B. ~' .

'Essen/OE Purpose: To analyze the amount of excretion of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist . Schering AG) into human breast milk foflowing i.v. injection of a clinlcal dose. Materials and methods: Gadopentetate dirneglumine (Gd-DTPA) was injected i. v, in 20 lactating women (23 -38 yr.) . Breast feeding was interrupted for at least 24 hrs. Serial sampies of expressed milk were collected and analyzed for gadolinium concentration by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry at a wavelength of 342.247 nm. Resulls : The cumulative amount of gadolinium excreted in human breast milk du ring aperiod of 24 hours was 0,57:tO.71 IJmol (range 0.05 -3.0 IJmol) Gd. There was a significant correlation between the cumulative amount of gadolinium and the injected dose (p = 0.01) as weil as the volume excreted over 24 hours (p = 0.002). The excreted dose was .... 0.04 % of the administered i.v. dose (range 0.001 % -0,04 %, mean 0.009\u00b10.010 %) for all cases. Coneluslon: Less than 0.04 % of administered gadopentetate dimeglumine is excreted into human breast milk. The amount transferred to a nursing infant orally would be far more than l00x below the permitted i.v. dose (200 IJmoflkg b.w.) for neonates.
