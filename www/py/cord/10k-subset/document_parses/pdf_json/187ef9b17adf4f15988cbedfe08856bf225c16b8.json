However, multiple invasion-related genes with complementary and overlapping functions afford the parasite the plasticity to vary ligands used for invasion, leading to phenotypic variation and immune evasion. Overcoming the challenge posed by redundant ligands requires a deeper understanding of conditions that select for variant phenotypes and the molecular mediators. While host factors including receptor heterogeneity and acquired immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, we have previously shown that host-independent changes in invasion phenotype can be achieved by continuous culturing of the W2mef and Dd2 P. falciparum strains in moving suspension as opposed to static conditions. Here, we have used a highly biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach to identify the molecular signatures of variation associated with the phenotype switch. The data show increased expression of particular invasion-related genes in switched parasites, as well as a large number of genes encoding proteins that are either exported or form part of the export machinery. The genes with most markedly increased expression included members of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA), reticulocyte binding homologues (RH), surface associated interspersed proteins (SURFIN), exported protein family 1 (EPF1) and Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) gene families. the data indicate changes in expression of a repertoire of genes not previously associated with erythrocyte invasion phenotypes, suggesting the possibility that moving suspension culture may also select for other traits.",

Recently, we discovered another remarkable feature of W2mef and Dd2. When continuously cultivated in moving suspension cultures, these strains gradually gain the ability to invade neuraminidase-treated (sialic acid-deficient) erythrocytes, but remain sialic acid-dependent when kept in continuous static cultures 17 . This observation was surprising given that no modifications were made to either the parasites or erythrocytes used for culturing. Interestingly, the observed phenotype selected by moving suspension culture was similar to that achieved in other experiments by selection on sialic acid-deficient erythrocytes, and similarly associated with greatly increased expression of the Rh4 and eba165 genes. We considered the possibility that the phenotypic switch to sialic acid-independent invasion may also involve genes that are not yet known to be associated with different invasion pathways. To this end, we conducted whole transcriptome analysis of schizonts from parasite cultures that had switched invasion pathways during suspension culture, compared with schizonts from unswitched static cultures, using highly biologically replicated samples 35 . This has revealed the differential expression of a larger repertoire of genes likely to be involved in invasion phenotype switching, including known invasion ligands as well as gene families not previously implicated in erythrocyte invasion.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed overlaps among members of sample groups, with no specific group clustering ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This was expected since we envisioned only subtle differences to exist between suspended and static cultured parasites. Nonetheless, to test the robustness of our approach, we checked for outliers using default parameters of the DaMiRseq package 37 and removed samples with mean absolute correlation \u22640. 85 . We then performed differential expression analysis with DESeq2 using retained samples while correcting for any batch effects (designated here as corrected analysis). A correlation of the fold change values for corrected vs uncorrected analysis shows a near perfect linear relationship, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Furthermore, we correlated the FPKM values of all samples to the FPKMs of data from a previous time-course study 38 and confirmed that all samples had peak expression at 40-48 hours post invasion ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). This was considered as a validation of well-synchronized cultures and therefore, qualifying all samples for inclusion in the subsequent analyses. Based on the results of our aforementioned quality checks we resolved to include all samples in our primary analysis. and their respective suspended cultures were monitored at regular intervals by invasion assays. Baseline cultures were confirmed to be SA-dependent, while suspended parasites gradually acquired SA-independent invasion phenotype with increasing length of time in culture. Schizonts were harvested at baseline, and weeks 8 and 6, respectively for suspended W2mef (a) and Dd2 (b). Broken lines indicate suspended replicates which were not sequenced.",

A closer look at the differentially expressed genes show similar patterns, with many invasion-related and exported protein genes being more highly expressed in SP cultures relative to their ST counterparts. Furthermore, we tested the robustness of this approach by pooling all static samples (ST + BL) and compared them to SP samples in a differential expression analysis.

Identification of large numbers of highly expressed exported protein genes prompted us to take a closer look at the transcriptome-wide pattern of some exported protein family members. We observed higher expression levels for all 10 members of the SURFIN family in SP parasites relative to BL, with 8 members having more than two-fold increased expression ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). The genes encoding SURFIN4.1 and SURFIN4.2 which have been localized to merozoites 40, 41 , had the largest change in expression levels within this gene family. Interestingly, all 10 genes belonging to the Maurer's cleft associated exported protein family 1 (EPF1) 42 also had higher transcript levels in SP parasites compared to BL cultures (Fig. 4c) . Likewise, fifteen genes belonging to the Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) family, had more than two-fold increased expression in SP parasites (Fig. 4d) .

Having identified genes that are significantly differentially expressed between SP and BL cultures of W2mef, we performed similar differential expression analyses for the Dd2 clone. Generally, the range of fold change values observed for differential expression between Dd2 SP and Dd2 BL were lower (\u22121.98 to 3.25) compared to those in W2mef (\u22124.25 to 6.85) (Supplementary Fig. S8 ), potentially because Dd2 was cultured for a shorter time (6 rather than 8 weeks) or a possible biological difference which might exist between the two apparently isogenic strains when grown in suspension conditions. Using a cutoff of 4-fold difference between groups and adjusted P value < 0.01, twelve genes were identified to be differentially expressed between Dd2 SP and Dd2 BL, all of which were more highly expressed in Dd2 SP (Supplementary Fig. S9) . A less stringent cutoff of more than 2-fold difference identified 165 genes to be significantly differentially expressed, with 159 of these expressed at higher levels in SP parasites ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table S9 ). The pattern of gene expression was similar to that of W2mef, with Rh4 and eba165 among the most highly differentially expressed genes. Additionally, a number of exported protein genes as well as functionally unknown ones were more highly expressed in Dd2 SP relative to Dd2 BL. A comparison of differential gene expression in W2mef with Dd2 showed a significant positive correlation (Fig. 5b) , with the directionality of expression of most of the highly significantly expressed genes in W2mef remaining similar in Dd2 (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S10 ). Similar to W2mef, majority of the individual biological replicates showed concordance with the results from the pooled analyses ( Supplementary Fig. S11) . Analysis of the genes differentially expressed between Dd2 SP and Dd2 BL for enriched gene ontology terms (P < 0.01) identified protein kinase activity and translocation of peptides or proteins into host cell cytoplasm to be among the most enriched terms (Supplementary Table S10 ). A comparison of the levels of differential expression of the eba and rh gene between ST and SP parasites in the current RNA sequencing study and our previous RT-qPCR analysis shows a strong positive correlation of results from the two studies ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ).",

These previous studies have shown that invasion phenotype switching has mainly been through the differential expression of members of the Rh or eba gene families. We recently demonstrated that the phenotypic switching in P. falciparum W2mef and Dd2 clones could be achieved through simply culturing them in moving suspension rather than static conditions 17 . In this report, we have investigated this phenomenon further using whole transcriptome analyses. We show significantly increased expression of four Rh and two eba genes in SP parasites relative to BL controls, all of which have been implicated in previous invasion phenotype switching studies, except eba181 18, [26] [27] [28] 34, 49, 50 . The mechanistic relevance of the differential expression of multiple invasion-related genes in SP parasites is not yet known, but it is notable that the encoded proteins possess erythrocyte binding properties and have been shown to function during early interactions leading to invasion 13, 14, 51 . In contrast, the invasion-related genes ama1 and Rh5 which function during the later stages of invasion 13 were not significantly differentially expressed in SP parasites, suggesting that moving suspension culture may possibly select for parasites with stronger interactions to fasten onto the erythrocyte surface prior to entry.",

Increased rigidity and adhesion of infected erythrocytes enhance sequestration through cytoadherence and rosetting, both of which are associated with disease severity 58 . A substantial number of exported proteins were highly expressed in suspended parasites, prominent ones being the SURFINs and EPF1. Both SURFIN4.1 and SURFIN4.2 have been localized to the parasitophorous vacuole and merozoite surface, with SURFIN4.2 suggested to have a role in merozoite invasion 40, 41, 59 . Available data show that SURFIN4.2 forms a complex with glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) and RON4 in both schizonts and free merozoite, with anti-SURFIN4.2 antibodies partially inhibiting erythrocyte invasion 59 . Additionally, SURFIN4.2 is exported to the erythrocyte surface 40 , with deletion of its gene resulting in reduced erythrocyte membrane rigidity 43 . SURFIN4.1, though annotated as a pseudogene, has been shown to be expressed as a functional protein, with its knockdown resulting in impaired merozoite formation during schizogony 60 . The EPF1 family are Maurer's cleft associated proteins whose reduced expression results in deficient merozoite release 42 . Efficient merozoite release increases the chances of successful invasion and thus higher parasite growth, which is a hallmark of parasites grown under flow conditions 17,61-63 .",

            "text": "The PHIST proteins are known to be exported to various locations including both the host cell periphery and cytosol, as well as the parasite's parasitophorous vacuole, Maurer's cleft and merozoite surface [64] [65] [66] [67] . They function by interacting with host erythrocyte cytoskeletal components 64, 65, 68, 69 as well as parasite-specific proteins such as PfEMP1, skeleton binding protein 1 (SBP1), and knob associated histidine rich protein (KAHRP) 66, 70, 71 , ultimately leading to cytoadherension and resistance to stress 68, 72 . PHIST proteins such as members of the PFEMP1 trafficking protein (PTP) contribute to cytoadherence by mediating the successful trafficking of PfEMP1 from the Maurer's cleft to the host cell surface 43 . Additionally, PTP2 mediate cell-cell communication by trafficking exosome-like vesicles between infected erythrocytes, a phenomenon which modulates host immune response and increase gametocytogenesis [73] [74] [75] . The contents of these vesicles range from parasite DNA, RNA and PfEMP1 proteins 74, 76 . Elevated expression of exported protein genes in SP parasites may thus have physiological relevance, as these proteins could potentially affect the rigidity of the erythrocyte membrane to withstand the stress imposed by moving suspension culture conditions, mediate effective communication among parasites, modulate gametocyte production, etc. Another plausible hypothesis for the increased expression of the exported protein genes is to increase the adherent properties of erythrocytes in preparation for stronger binding to possible endothelial molecules in an in vivo setting.",

We observed increased expression of some members of the ApiAP2 transcription factor family which are involved in the regulation of different processes and stages during parasite development [77] [78] [79] . Notably, AP2-G, which regulates gametocyte conversion 78,80-82 is among the most significantly differentially expressed genes in W2mef SP 79 . This gene is epigenetically controlled, and thus the observation could be a consequence of global upregulation of epigenetic-regulated genes. However, a recent study has shown that AP2-G interacts with AP2-I to drive the expression of invasion related genes, potentially to increase the invasion efficiency of sexually committed Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:245 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56386-y www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ merozoites 83 . Given the length of time of culture adaptation and the observation that SP parasites grow better than ST parasites 17 , we postulate that the expressed AP2-G, if functional, is to enhance parasite outgrowth by increasing invasion efficiency. Another AP2 with increased expression in suspended parasites is AP2-EXP which regulates the expression of clonally variant genes 79 . This is unsurprising given the extent of increased expression of exported protein genes in the current dataset.",

If parasites have the cellular machinery to sense culture motion, they might alter their phenotype in response, reminiscent of nutrient sensing by the sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related serine/ threonine protein kinase KIN 84 . A more general possibility is that a subset of parasites that grow better under such conditions are selected over time, given the length of time it takes for the majority of parasites under suspension culture to acquire the neuraminidase-resistant erythrocyte invasion phenotype. The significant enrichment in expression of epigenetically controlled genes in the SP cultures relative to ST has offered a clue about the possible mechanisms for the changes in gene expression. Elucidating these mechanisms that connect culture agitation with transcriptional changes that mediate phenotypic variation will be the focus of our future studies.",

Briefly, Parasites were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 0.5% Albumax II (Gibco), 20 mg hypoxanthine, 2 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma) and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin sulfate (Sigma) using human group O + erythrocytes at 4% hematocrit in a mixed gas environment of 93% nitrogen, 5% CO 2 , and 2% oxygen (Air Liquide, Birmingham, United Kingdom). Cultures were initially grown under static culture conditions for the generation of baseline schizont material for analysis, and the sialic acid-dependent invasion phenotype of both strains was confirmed using a previously described procedure 17 .

This study aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes between parasites of the same strain grown under different conditions, thus we projected to study each condition with eight biological replicates. Parasites were maintained as 25 ml cultures at 4% hematocrit, and at about 10% parasitemia with more than 50% rings, the ring stages were selected by treatment with 5% sorbitol 86 .

Reads were counted using the SummarizeOverlaps feature of the GenomicAlignments package 89 in R, against the P. falciparum 3D7 version 3.0 reference genome sequence using an annotation file that had masked out extremely (2020) 10:245 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56386-y www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ polymorphic gene regions, duplicated genes, and the var, rifin and stevor large subtelomeric gene families so that they were not included in the analysis 35 . Differential expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2 36 in R. Briefly, DESeqDataSet was constructed from the SummarizedExperiment object and low expressed genes filtered out. To model for batch effect, \"batch\" was included in the design formula. Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) were made from the DESeqDataSet. Results tables were generated from the DESeqDataSet using Wald test and differential expression analyses conducted with the DESeq2 results function. A combination of differential expression (log2 fold change values) and level of significance (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P values) were used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between SP parasites and their corresponding BL or ST cultures. Karyotype was constructed with the karyoploteR package 90 in R. Principal Component Analyses were performed with DESeq2 using default parameters and plotted with ggplot.",
