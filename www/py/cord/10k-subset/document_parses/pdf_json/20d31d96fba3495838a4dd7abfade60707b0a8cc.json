This finding suggests that minor, unspecific cytokine secretion may be induced in blood cells by means of residual pyrogens (e.g., endotoxin) included in recombinant antigen but not in synthetic peptide preparations [41] . However, HBoV VP2-specific T cell responses were not detected in all individuals studied, because, for many donors, only low or undetectable IFN-\u2425 secretion was observed, suggesting antigen specificity of the detected T cell responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In the study group, an age-dependent decrease in HBoVspecific T cell responses was observed. This might be the result of an age-related decrease in and an impairment of the amount and functions of virus-specific T cell populations, because it has been described for other viral infections (e.g., for populations with adenovirus) [42] . Furthermore, it is known that active T cell responses against pathogens undergo confinement to specific memory populations with increasing time after primary infection in the absence of exogenous restimulation events or endogenous reactivations of latent viral infections. Because all currently published data on the epide-miologic profile of HBoV strongly suggest that primary infection occurs in the very early years of childhood [9 -17, 20] , the time-dependent reduction in the number of virus-specific T cells might be explained by a lack of frequent pathogen contact. This may be considered to provide additional proof of the early time point when HBoV infection occurs during childhood. Independent of age, female subjects had higher numbers of cells secreting IFN-\u2425 than did male subjects, especially among younger individuals; this finding possibly indicates more-frequent spontaneous viral restimulation (e.g., by increased contact with children with acute infection), resulting in an overall increase in the HBoV-specific cellular immune response. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the most prominent difference in sex-specific cellular responses was observed in individuals born between 1970 and 1979, an age group in which women presumably have the most frequent contact with small children. However, because no information on the family status of the study subjects is available, these data will have to be confirmed by additional epidemiologic investigations.

recombinant baculovirus bacVP2/HBoV encoding the VP2 gene of the HBoV Stockholm 2 isolate (nt 3443-5071) was generated and used for infection of High-5 cells. In parallel, cells were infected with a previously established recombinant baculovirus bacVP2/ B19V encoding the VP2 protein of B19V. SDS-PAGE studies of bacVP2/HBoV-and bacVP2/B19V-infected cells lysed 72 h after infection revealed high-yield expression of the VP2 proteins, with an apparent molecular weight of \u03f362 kDa noted after Coomassie staining (figure 1A [lane 1] and 1B [lane 1]). The identity of both HBoV with B19V VP2 proteins was demonstrated using Western blot analysis of serum samples obtained from individuals seropositive for HBoV or B19V IgG (figure 1A [lane 2] and 1B [lane 2]). Purification and characterization of recombinant HBoV VP2 VLPs. To analyze whether the expressed HBoV VP2 proteins posses the capacity to spontaneously aggregate to VLPs, as shown for the VP2 proteins of numerous parvoviruses, bacVP2/ HBoV-infected High-5 cells underwent a previously established procedure for the purification of VP2 VLPs of human B19V [25]. Separation of proteins in precleared lysates of High-5 cells expressing either HBoV or B19V VP2, by means of CsCl ultracentrifugation, resulted in pure preparations of VP2 proteins, as was shown by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining (figure 1A [lane 3] and 1B [lane 3]). BacVP2/HBoV-infected High-5 cells and purified preparations of HBoV VP2 proteins were assessed by electron microscopy. Analysis of cross-sections prepared from bacVP2/HBoVinfected High-5 cells revealed a high number of particulate structures in the cytoplasm, suggesting spontaneous formation of HBoV VLPs in cells expressing VP2 (figure 2A). This could be confirmed by electron microscopic analysis of CsCl gradient fractions in which VP2 proteins could be detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Here, distinct icosahedral capsid structures with an approximate diameter of 21-25 nm (figure 2B) were detectable. The density of HBoV VP2 VLPs was assessed by ultracentrifugation in continuous CsCl gradients (1.29 -1.4 g/cm 3 ) for 48 h at 150,000 g and revealed a value of \u03f31.33 g/cm 3 . Detection of HBoV-and B19V-specific antibodies. In total, 69 adults were included in the study, and they were found to exhibit strong IgG-mediated humoral immune responses against HBoV VP2 VLPs, by use of ELISA (median OD 450 value, 0.863 [range, 0.248 -1.124]) (figure 3).
