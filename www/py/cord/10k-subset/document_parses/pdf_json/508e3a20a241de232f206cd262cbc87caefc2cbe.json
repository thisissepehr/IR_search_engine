This study aimed at correlating these polymorphisms to lethal infections during childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A matched case-control study of 34 patients who died due to infections during ALL treatment and 68 ALL patients without lethal infections was performed. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood smears and specific fragments including the polymorphic site of each gene were amplified. In the total study population, 23/102 (22.5%) of the children carried at least two variant alleles (high-producer haplotype). The variant genotypes were equally distributed between cases and controls [relative risk (RR) 1.17 (CI 0.33-2.22, P = 0.752)]. With regard to infective organisms, no statistically significant differences could be detected between the groups for bacterial infections [RR 1.59 (CI 0.56-4.50), P 0.379]. Patients with a LT-a (10.5 kb/5.5 kb; 5.5 kb/5.5 kb) haplotype, however, seemed to have a significant higher risk of attracting a lethal infection during induction/consolidation chemotherapy (RR 2.98, CI 0.98-9.01, P = 0.05). These results support a role of specific genetic polymorphisms on lethal infections during induction chemotherapy of ALL treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infections in patients after chemotherapy remain a relevant risk, despite modern anti-infective treatment [1] . Childhood leukemia is regarded a principally ''curable disease'' these days, cure rates exceeding 80% in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) underline the importance to avoid deaths due to side effects [27] . The incidence of infections in oncology patients is 14-60%, and up to 10% of the patients die in the context of the infections [2, 3] . Several risk factors for infections are well known, such as the duration of neutropenia, co-medication with steroids, parenteral nutrition and central venous lines [4] [5] [6] . Besides, genetic factors influence the susceptibility to infection: Several studies showed (conflicting) results with regard to the role of cytokine production and the outcome of patients during sepsis. Hence, genetic polymorphisms might influence the course of infections in critically ill patients [7] [8] [9] . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alfa (LT-a) function as mediators of immune regulation and inflammation. Both lymphokines have similar biologic activities, and show 35% identity and 50% homology in amino acid sequence [10, 11] . The genes coding for TNF and LT-a are located tandemly on the chromosomal region 6p21. 3-21.1 and are closely linked to the HLA-B locus within a highly polymorphic region of the major histocompatibility complex. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TNF gene have been described. Exchange of guanine by adenine at position -308 of the TNF promoter region (TNF2 allele) is associated with higher serum levels of soluble TNF [12] . The TNF -308 (G ? A) polymorphism has been associated with susceptibility to cerebral malaria, lepromatous leprosy, mucocutaneous leishmaniosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, fatal meningococcal disease, and septic shock [13] [14] [15] [16] . A polymorphism in the coding region at position ?252 of the LT-a gene (A ? G) leads to different alleles of LT-a, here referred to as LT-a (10.5 kb) for the wild-type allele, and LT-a (5.5 kb) for the variant allele. The LT-a (5.5 kb) allele was associated with higher levels of soluble LT-a in patients homozygous for LT-a (5.5 kb) [17] . A strong association between the LT-a (5.5 kb) allele and adverse outcome in autoimmune diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease) has been described. Biologic actions of both cytokines as well as their association with autoimmune and severe inflammatory disorders have drawn interest to their potential role in the prognosis of infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 457, "end": 460, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 461, "end": 463, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 638, "end": 641, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 944, "end": 947, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 948, "end": 951, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 952, "end": 955, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1192, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1196, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1292, "text": "3-21.1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1635, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1870, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1875, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1880, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1881, "end": 1885, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2225, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although a potential contribution of the TNF-308 (G ?

Third, no TNF-a levels were measured in the study population, hence the conclusion whether or not the genetic profile resulted in significantly different TNF serum levels cannot be answered from our data.
