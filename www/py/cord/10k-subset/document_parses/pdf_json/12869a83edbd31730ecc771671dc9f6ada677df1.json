This study was designed to evaluate ginseng stem-leaf saponins (GSLS) in combination with selenium (Se) for their adjuvant effect on the immune response to vaccination against NDV and IBV in chickens. A live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV was diluted in saline solution containing GSLS or Se or both and used to immunize chickens via a intraocular-andintranasal route. Results showed that GSLS promoted significantly higher NDV-and IBV-specific antibody responses with the highest antibody response detected in GSLS-Se group. The increased antibody was capable of neutralizing NDV and IBV. In addition, GSLS-Se enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4. More importantly GSLS-Se was found to promote early production and prolong the duration of the antibody responses. In order to improve the efficacy of vaccination in chicken flocks, the diluent containing GSLS-Se deserves further studies to evaluate its effect on other chicken vaccines.",

            "text": "Adjuvants are known to improve the efficacy of vaccines (Meunier et al., 2016) . Our previous studies have showed that saponins extracted from the stem-leaf of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (GSLS) added an adjuvant effect to vaccine. Zhai et al. (2011b Zhai et al. ( , 2014 observed that oral administration of GSLS has capacity to improve vaccination against ND, avian influenza, and infectious bursal disease in chicken. Yu et al. (2015b) found that oral administration of GSLS had capacity to recover the chickens' immunity with oxidative stress by showing increased antibody response to NDV and avian influenza virus (AIV), splenocyte proliferation, and intestinal IgA+ cells and ilELs. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for animals and plays a crucial role in immunity. Studies have suggested a close relation between selenium and the immunity in chickens (Wang et al., 2018a,b) . We hypothesized that combination of GSLS and Se could boost the immune responses and improved the immunization. However, no report has been found regarding the combined effect of GSLS and Se on vaccination. As a live vaccine is usually supplied in a form of lyophilized powder, it needs to be resuspended in a saline solution before use. In this study, we used a solution containing GSLS and Se as a diluent to resuspend a live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV and evaluate the adjuvant effect of the diluent on the immune responses in chickens.",

After 20 h, 20 \u03bcL MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for another 4 h. The plates were centrifuged (1,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min), and the supernatant was carefully removed. Approximately 150 \u03bcl of acidic dimethyl sulfoxide (0.04 N HCl) was added to each well and mixed thoroughly by slightly shaking to solubilize the MTT formazan. The average optical density (OD) was read at 570 nm. The stimulation index (SI) was calculated based on the following formula: SI = (OD value of mitogen-stimulated cells)/(OD value of non-stimulated cells).",

To control these diseases on commercial chicken farms in China, a live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV is usually used for vaccination. The vaccine is generally supplied in form of lyophilized powder and diluted in PSS before use. But feeble immunity has been frequently found in chicken flocks, leading to poor immune protection. For examples, Berhanu et al.

MDA gradually declines and reaches a low level due to natural degradation of proteins 2 or 3 wk after chicks are hatched (Hamal et al., 2006) . A similar change of MDA was found in chickens without immunization in the present study ( Figure 2 ).",

Chickens with HI or antibody titers lower than the minimum are susceptible to infections of NDV and IBV. Figure 2 shows MDA declined below the minimum at 18 days old for HI titer to NDV while 15 days old for antibody titer to IBV after hatched chickens. An incubation period is needed for a vaccine to induce a protective immune response. Ganapathy et al. (2006) reported NDV HI antibody titers in commercial chickens began to rise after 14 D post immunizing with live vaccine of NDV via a intraocular-and-intraoral route. To induce the immune responses higher than the minimum protective antibody titers, it took 12 D for NDV-specific HI titers and 18 D for IBV-specific antibody titer when the vaccine was resuspended in PSS while it took only 9 D for NDV and 15 D for IBV when the vaccine was resuspended in a solution containing GSLS-Se (Figure 2) , indicating that GSLS-Se promoted early production of the vaccine-induced antibodies and shortened the incubation period.",
