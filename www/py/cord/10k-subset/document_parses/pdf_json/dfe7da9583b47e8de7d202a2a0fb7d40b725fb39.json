The feeding regimen was colostrum once daily, day 4 to 14; milk replacer once daily, day 15 to 28; and calf starter ad libitum, day 4 to 84. Bull calves were fed for 42 days and heifers for 84 days. Calves fed acidified colostrum refused more feed and were less efficient from day 4 to 14 than calves fed buffered colostrum. Bulls were more sensitive to acidified colostrum than heifers.

Almost all colostrum refusals occurred during the first 2 to 3 days of feeding. After 3 days, refusals essentially were zero unless the calf was ill.

Intakes and gains fluctuated from day 4 to 28 and may have caused inconsistent feed efficiencies. Differences in feed efficiencies early in life probably mean little because ADG and feed efficiencies from day 29 to 84 were similar for all treatments.

Contents for butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, and total VFA were similar for all calves. Other researchers (2, 9, 12) reported similar changes in VFA profile when buffers were added to high concentrate rations. The lactic acid concentration of rumen fluid from heifers fed diets without NaHCO3 (.20/~moles/ ml) was higher (P<.07) than heifers fed diets containing NaHCO3 (.09 /zmoles/ml) and possibly related to concurrent changes in amount of propionate ( Table 7 ).

Two percent sodium bicarbonate in the starter did not elevate rumen pH as in (2) . Differences in ration composition and maturity of calves probably accounted for the varied results between studies.
