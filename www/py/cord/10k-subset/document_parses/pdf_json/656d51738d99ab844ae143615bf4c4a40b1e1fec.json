            "text": "Abstract The aim of this study was to describe the findings on plain chest radiographs in patients with herpes simplex virus pneumonia (HSVP). The study was based on 17 patients who at a retrospective search have been found to have a monoinfection with herpes simplex virus. The diagnosis was established by isolation of the virus from material obtained during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) which also included broncho-alveolar lavage and tissue sampling. Fourteen patients had a chest radiograph performed within 24 h of the date of the FOB. Two radiographs showed no abnormalities of the lung parenchyma. The radiographs of the other 12 patients showed lung opacification, predominantly lobar or more extensive and always bilateral. Most patients presented with a mixed airspace and interstitial pattern of opacities, but 11 of 14 showed at least an airspace consolidation. Lobar, seg-mental, or subsegmental atelectasis was present in 7 patients, and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion in 8 patients, but only in 1 patient was it a large amount. In contradiction to the literature which reports a high correlation between HSVP and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 11 of 14 patients did not meet the pathophysiological criteria for ARDS. The radiologist may suggest the diagnosis of HSVP when bilateral airspace consolidation or mixed opacities appear in a susceptible group of patients who are not thought to have ARDS or pulmonary edema. The definite diagnosis of HSV pneumonia can be established only on the basis of culture of material obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage.",

All these conditions were shown to be associated with an increased risk of herpes simplex virus pneumonia (HSVP). It is also known that intubation causes initial upper airway infection perhaps as a result of local trauma which might lead to HSVP. Tuxen et al. reported a relationship between HSVP and the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) established clinically and radiologically [13, 14, 15] . This was later confirmed in an autopsy report of 54 patients suffering from burns [16] . Hematogenous spread to the lungs from infected lesions may also occur. This could be initiated by disruption of virally infected tissues by burns or smoke inhalation.",

A description of the radiographic changes in neonatal lung infection caused by HSV type 2 contracted during delivery has been provided by Dominguez et al. [18] . They described a chro-992 Fig. 3 A 75- year-old male operated on for a subarachnoid bleeding. Postoperative cardiac complications occurred with myocardial ischemia leading to forward and backward failure and multi-organ failure. Chest radiograph taken on day of BAL after 20 days of intubation shows a diffuse, bilateral interstitial pattern easily mistaken for pulmonary edema; however, note the small size of the heart and azygos vein Fig. 2 A 63 -year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome developed acute myeloid leukemia. During treatment with chemotherapy patient became even more immunosuppressed. Broncho-alveolar lavage was performed because of fever and opacities on the chest radiograph. There is a large opacity in the apex of the right lower lobe, but on closer examination bilateral diffuse opacities are seen (e.g., left perihilar region) nological development consisting of a normal chest radiograph, interstitial changes, airspace consolidation and, lastly, diffuse consolidation of both lungs; however, extrapolation from type 2 to type 1 HSVP and also from infants to adults is a priori not possible. Nevertheless, radiological similarities can be expected since both viruses produce identical histopathological changes. Other authors have only briefly mention the radiographic findings in studies concerning primarily the pathological and clinical manifestations. Schuller et al. examined 42 patients with HSVP and all chest radiographs were abnormal: 93 % showed pulmonary infiltrates, 29 % pleural effusion, and 12 % atelectasis [19] . Ramsey et al. reported 20 patients with HSVP: 9 had focal abnormalities, 3 multifocal, and 8 diffuse abnormalities [5] . Graham and Snell describe a healthy 20-year-old mother with HSVP and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray [6] . Chabot et al. found 7 patients with HSVP after heart transplantation: 5 of them showed diffuse bilateral changes, either mixed airspace\u00b1interstitial or interstitial micronodular [20] .",
