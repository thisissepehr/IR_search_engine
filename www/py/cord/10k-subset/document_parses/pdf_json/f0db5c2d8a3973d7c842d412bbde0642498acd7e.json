ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) within the promoters of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby activating their transcription.

The difference between IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb has been intensively studied. Consistent with previous studies 5,6 , our results using Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells suggest that both STAT1 and STAT2 are involved in the early induction of ISGs in response to IFN-\u03b1 , most likely through the formation of ISGF3, but that when IFN-\u03b1 stimulation is prolonged, ISGs can be induced by a STAT2-dependent, STAT1-independent pathway (Fig. 8) . Accordingly, IFN-\u03b1 can inhibit HCV replication to some extent in the absence of STAT1 (Fig. 1) . This inhibition requires STAT2 (Fig. 2) and IRF9 (Fig 4) but does not appear to require STAT3 or STAT6 (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, IFN-\u03b1 can induce STAT2 phosphorylation in STAT1 knockout cells (Fig. 7) . Previous studies have shown that expression of a fusion protein of STAT2 and IRF9 inhibits the replication of viruses including HCV in the absence of STAT1 (refs 28, 29) . It is therefore likely that IFN-\u03b1 can inhibit HCV replication through the STAT2/IRF9 complex 9 . Our results also suggest that unlike IFN-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03bb induces expression of the majority of ISGs and inhibits HCV replication exclusively through a STAT1-dependent pathway. This difference between IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb signaling may possibly explain the fact that the genes induced by IFN-\u03bb are typically a subset of the genes induced by IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 13, 15, 30 . Our microarray analysis indicated that IFN-\u03b1 induced expression of ISGs such as OAS2 and IFIT1 in STAT1 knockout Huh-7.5 cells (Table 1 ). In contrast, the induction of these ISGs is abrogated in STAT1 knockout fibrosarcoma cells 9 . Interestingly, overexpression of STAT2 in these cells restores the induction of OAS2 and IFIT1 and also enables induction of genes that do not contain ISREs. Endogenous STAT2 may also mediate ISRE-independent gene induction in response to IFN-\u03b1 , at least in certain cell types. Only ~20% of people infected with HCV spontaneously clear the virus, in part because HCV evades host immune responses by various mechanisms 31 . For example, HCV decreases RIG-I-like receptor-dependent IFN production by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) in infected cells 32, 33 . HCV has also been proposed to suppress ISGF3-mediated gene induction 31 . When overexpressed, the HCV core protein binds to STAT1 and prevents its phosphorylation 34 . However, a study using a luciferase reporter assay showed that HCVcc infection does not block ISRE-dependent gene induction in response to IFN-\u03b2 35 . This may suggest that like IFN-\u03b1 , IFN-\u03b2 can induce ISG expression independently of STAT1. Indeed, treatment with INF-\u03b2 decreased NS5A in STAT1 knockout cells (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). We showed that knockout of STAT1 abolished the induction Fold changes relative to untreated NT sgRNA-expressing cells were calculated. Probe sets that showed > 1.5-fold increase in response to both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb in NT sgRNA-expressing cells but showed little changes (within 1.5-fold) due to STAT1 KO were selected.

Until recently, recombinant IFN-\u03b1 , alone or in combination with ribavirin, was the only therapeutic option for patients infected with HCV. IFN-\u03b1 is also produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells that have received viral RNA from HCV-infected hepatocytes via exosomes 37 . HCV-infected hepatocytes, on the other hand, preferentially produce IFN-\u03bb 38 . Humans have four IFN-\u03bb genes (IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3, and IFNL4) 39 . IFN-\u03bb 1 was used throughout this study. We have confirmed that IFN-\u03bb 2 treatment is also unable to decrease NS5A in STAT1 knockout cells (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The newly discovered IFN-\u03bb 4 is expressed only in people who carry the IFNL4-\u0394 G allele and not in the others because of a frame shift mutation. When infected with HCV, people carrying the IFNL4-\u0394 G allele show higher ISG expression and lower HCV RNA levels in the liver. This is consistent with the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb 4 observed in cell culture 40 . However, people carrying the IFNL4-\u0394 G allele are less likely to clear HCV infection spontaneously or in response to IFN-\u03b1 -based therapy. The reason for this paradox is unknown, but IFN-\u03bb 4 has been speculated to render HCV-infected hepatocytes refractory to IFN-\u03b1 , for example by inducing the expression of USP18, which inhibits IFN-\u03b1 but not IFN-\u03bb signaling 41 .
