Our findings suggest that the organization of future pandemic response plans can greatly benefit from online data obtained in almost real time [19, 20] . A dedicated online registry able to assess the week-by-week Flu-OR in each ICU may help to better distribute resources according to the actual needs. Even if ICUs were encouraged to do a daily assessment of the presence of patients with A (H1N1), we chose to report the calculation per week first to be consistent with the French organization and the National Institute for Public Health Surveillance (NIPHS), which displayed the time course of the pandemic weekly, and also to simplify data notification for participating centers.

Over the 3-month pandemic period in Australia and New Zealand [11] , the ANZICS (Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society) investigators reported that an average of 5.2% of available ICU bed-days were occupied by patients with H1N1 infection, whereas the peak percentage ranged from 8.9% to 19% [11] . In our study, 7.6% of the beds of enrolled ICUs were occupied by influenza-infected patients during the whole study period, and a maximum Flu-OR recorded per week in individual ICUs reached 35%. Inclusion of the 10 ICUs that had not admitted any patients with A(H1N1) would have lowered global Flu-OR but would not have changed the maximal Flu-ORs that we observed. The ICU length of stay, however, may have impacted the Flu-OR since a large difference between the two reports was observed: the median durations of ICU stay were 7.4 days (IQR of 3 to 16) in the ANZICS study and 10 days (IQR of 5 to 24) in French ICUs. Uneven time and regional distribution may also impact the Flu-OR calculations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 199, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 437, "end": 441, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the ANZICS investigation, the number of days that ICU beds were occupied by infected patients per region was calculated by multiplying the total number of patients by their length of stay. This approach allowed us to estimate a peak Flu-OR per region but not per individual ICU. The results of our registry show that this can greatly underestimate true peak activities in some ICUs. This is of particular importance since H1N1 burden changed rapidly over time and from one ICU to the other. The web-based screening registry specifically developed for our study allowed a daily assessment of the ICU occupancy rate in individual ICUs with an accuracy similar to that in larger regions. For example, observations reported from the Paris area ( Figure 3 ) showed that the maximal Flu-OR significantly differed from the weekly Flu-OR calculated within all ICUs belonging to that region. Overall, our observations suggest that an accurate estimation of the influenza burden on ICUs requires a daily and real-time Flu-OR assessment, which seems feasible in view of our findings.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 745, "end": 753, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In anticipation of the flu surge, health authorities decided that, in order to alleviate the pressure on ICU beds, planned surgery activity should be cancelled when Flu-OR exceeded 15%. We contacted each participating ICU and confirmed that no canceling of scheduled surgery had been decided although Flu-OR exceeded 15% in many ICUs. Such peak activities occurred for more than 103 weeks among 32 units. Future analysis may help to refine this threshold and thus may have to take into account how long it is exceeded. The magnitude of a pandemic and its consequences on the organization of a health-care system depend on several parameters and are notoriously difficult to predict [21, 22] . Therefore, experiences reported during the first waves throughout the world were useful to better elaborate forecasts taking into account different attack rates and epidemic wave durations [23, 24] . Data gathered in Canada during the first wave were applied to a variety of second-wave models to determine its impact on ICU and ventilator demand [21, 25] . An attack rate of greater than 20% can result in significant shortages in ICU beds and ventilators [21] . Retrospective estimations showed that attack rates in Europe [26] , North America, and Australia did not exceed 10% during each of the 2009 pandemic waves [27] . The overall impact also greatly depends on the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. High attack rate combined with a short epidemic duration and long expected duration of mechanical ventilation represents the worst scenario in terms of bed occupancy rate and thus the maximal burden. Given a 20% attack rate with a similar clinical presentation, French ICU resources in university hospitals would probably have been overwhelmed, according to our observations. A weakness of our study is that only a subset of French ICUs participated in the screening. Our cohort represented 35% of the whole French cohort reported during the same period to the health ministry. The distribution of the subset of university and non-university hospitals participating in this study within the seven areas (except in the northern area) suggests that French ICU health-care resources were reasonably well represented (Figure 1 ). This is supported by the comparability of baseline characteristics of patients within the present cohort to those of the entire French cohort (Table 1 ) [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 682, "end": 686, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 687, "end": 690, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 882, "end": 886, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1048, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1154, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1316, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2398, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2229, "end": 2238, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2384, "end": 2392, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "General inferences that can be made from this study are limited because of the difficulties in extrapolating from one health-care system to another.
