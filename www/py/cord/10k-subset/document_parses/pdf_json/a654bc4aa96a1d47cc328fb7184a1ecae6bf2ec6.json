In modern beekeeping, this problem expresses at two levels-worker populations within colonies, and colony densities (apiaries) at a landscape scale. Larger colony populations are associated with more honey hoarding 50 , which has driven beekeeping interventions such as swarm prevention (discouraging colony reproductive fission), stimulatory feeding, and chemo-centric disease and parasite control to achieve unnaturally large forager populations and honey crops 51 . As a result, while peak-season worker populations in healthy natural colonies in hollow trees are about 18,000 52 , reported peak-season populations in healthy managed colonies range from 20,000-52,000 50, 53, 54 . In addition, the average volume of natural tree hollows occupied by bees ranges from 15-80 litres 55 , while with US beekeeping equipment the standard 'Langstroth hive body'the basic module of a hive-contains a volume of 43 l. Beekeepers adjust module number as needed to accommodate seasonal fluxes in incoming honey, resulting in nest volumes ranging from 43-172 l. Although higher population sizes do not necessarily translate to higher within-colony densities, it is still likely that these practices support unnaturally high densities, and some specialty practices-such as the production of comb honey-call for radically dense worker populations 56 . The fact that simulated 'natural' colonies (approx. 10,000 bees kept year-round in single 43 l hive bodies and left free to swarm) showed lower levels of Varroa mites and brood diseases compared with conventionally managed colonies (approx. 30,000 bees managed for swarm control) 54 suggests that worker density within colony deserves more attention in the context of ecologically informed health management.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 338, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 585, "end": 587, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 701, "end": 703, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 792, "end": 795, "text": "50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 796, "end": 799, "text": "53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 800, "end": 802, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 903, "end": 905, "text": "55", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1458, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1743, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NATure ecology & evoluTioN"}, {"text": "Moving from single colonies to apiaries (collections of multiple colonies in one location), beekeepers routinely maintain colonies at much greater densities in apiaries than occur in nature (Fig. 3a,b) .

Modern day beekeepers do just that, by replacing succumbed colonies with new ones, thus artificially replenishing the population with susceptible hosts. This practice is facilitated by the use of 'package' bees (one queen with several pounds of workers) and 'nucleus' colonies (small colonies with a queen, 1-2 pounds of bees, and 4-5 combs of brood), hundreds of thousands of which are shipped annually to beekeepers for restocking dead colonies.

Colonies from queens with higher mating number have greater disease resistance and overall survivorship [70] [71] [72] 190 . Genotypic diversity can be considered at scales beyond the colony. For example, the survivor stock approach discussed above may encourage disease resistance diversity at a landscape scale, assuming the presence of a variety of resistance alleles in breeding populations.

Managing apiaries that are separated in space, with sufficient numbers for adequate sample size, is expensive and represents a logistical challenge. Because of these challenges, most previous work in this realm has unfortunately not been replicated at the apiary level. Second, in most temperate climates honeybees have a distinct annual cycle that contributes variation to key colony parameters such as adult population size, brood production, and foraging. Studies focused on disease ecology and evolution must work within that annual cycle: if experimental manipulations fail once, they cannot be repeated until the following year. Third, honeybee colonies display variation even in closely related colonies within the same apiary, in terms of size, brood production, queen mating number, and temperament. Many of these parameters have direct bearing on responses to disease threats.

For example, studies can start with replicated apiaries with nucleus colonies with the same hive body design and equivalent numbers of workers and new queens that are genetically related. Fourth, disease studies should inoculate colonies with carefully measured, identical infectious doses. As with apiary-level replication, most disease studies in honeybees do not meet these criteria. Given the need for such studies, we suggest that funding agencies recognize these unique and challenging design needs and consider increasing funding limits for honeybee disease research proposals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 303, "text": "206", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "outlook"}, {"text": "Parasites form the greatest threat to the most economically important managed pollinator in the world. It is critical that we aim for health management practices that are rooted in the fundamental principles of evolution and ecology. To our minds, it is indefensible that current beekeeping practices are not only predicted to create more severe outbreaks, but to select for greater virulence. Developing new management systems that recognize ecological and evolutionary processes and constraints will take a global interdisciplinary effort uniting scientists from many fields with beekeepers and farmers. Such an effort must accommodate the challenging particularities of research on honeybees, but doing so will contribute to fundamental understanding of systems-level disease processes to the benefit of all. Such management systems must address other stressors, in particular pesticides and other agrochemicals known to negatively impact honeybees and wild bees 18, [207] [208] [209] [210] .

Infected colonies experience an additional mortality rate, \u03b1, due to parasite infection.

Thus, transmission potential among these bees can be thought of as nearly global, since long-range movement is combined with high potential for contacting other bee colonies.
