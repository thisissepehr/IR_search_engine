Furthermore, PCCs have been proposed as a substitution therapy in acquired coagulation factor deficiencies or as antagonists to warfarinlike anticoagulants [3\u00b15] . With the widespread use of PCCs, an increasing amount of data on possible side effects has been published: the association with thromboembolic complications [6\u00b18] and activation of the coagulation cascade [9\u00b111] have led to a call for cautious use of PCCs. A survey of thromboembolic episodes during treatment with PCCs conducted by Jeanne Lusher on behalf of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis reported 72 cases between 1987 and 1990 [6] . Most of the data concerning thrombogenicity and activation of the coagulation cascade were based on laboratory experiments [12\u00b114] or on small-scale clinical studies in hemophilia B patients [15\u00b118] . Substitution of coagulation factors is a major concern in the intensive care setting. Critically ill patients frequently undergo invasive procedures while suffering from disturbances of plasma coagulation and are therefore at a higher risk of bleeding. Administration of PCCs seems more convenient than transfusion of fresh frozen plasma with regard Measurements and results: Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial prothrombin time, fibrinogen, platelet count, plasma levels of coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, antithrombin, protein C, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment F 1+2 , and the fibrin degradation product D-dimer were measured prior to and 1, 3, and 24 h after administration of PCCs. PT as well as coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, TAT, and F 1+2 showed a significant increase after administration of PCCs. All other parameters remained unchanged. Conclusions: Administration of PCCs induces thrombin generation. No evidence for induction of disseminated intravascular coagulation in biochemical terms could be found. When rapid correction of acquired coagulation factor disturbances is warranted, the use of PCCs seems reasonable, but the elevated risk of intravascular thrombus formation should be kept in mind. to volume overload and speed of administration. On the other hand, the fear of inducing thrombotic complications or consumption coagulopathy has led many intensivists to adopt a cautious attitude toward substitution of coagulation factors. In vivo data on the use of modern PCC preparations in patients suffering from acquired coagulation factor deficiencies are limited; prospective studies investigating the effects of PCCs on coagulation activation in critically ill patients especially are missing. We therefore conducted a prospective study on the influence of PCCs on coagulation parameters in critically ill patients suffering from coagulation factor deficiency due to inadequate hepatic synthesis, in whom overt bleeding or the necessity of invasive procedures made substitution of coagulation factors necessary.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 239, "end": 242, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 243, "end": 245, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 404, "end": 409, "text": "[3\u00b15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 867, "end": 870, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1071, "text": "[15\u00b118]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study was performed between November 1997 and June 1998 according to the guidelines of the local ethical review board.

All blood samples were drawn from separate venous puncture sites. For coagulation tests, blood was collected into trisodium citrate, for platelet counting into ethylenediaminetebracetic acid. Blood was centrifuged immediately after being drawn at 3000 U/min for 30 min at 4 C and then stored at 70 C until work-up.

PT (Normotest, Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) and aPTT (Pathromtin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) were measured using a KC-10 coagulometer (Amelung, Lieme, Germany).

However, both venous and arterial thromboembolic events have been attributed to the use of PCCs [6, 8, 23\u00b126] . Moreover, induction of DIC was associated with administration of PCCs [11] . The exact causes of thrombogenicity associated with PCC therapy are not completely understood. Concentrates may contain activated coagulation factors and coagulant-active phospholipids, which might lead to an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways of hemostasis in the plasma [28\u00b131]. Repeated high doses of PCCs could lead to supranormal values of not deficient coagulation factors, thus contributing to a hypercoagulable state [29, 32] . Modern PCC preparations like the one used in our study contain only small amounts of activated coagulation factors, especially factors VIIa and IXa, which seem to be important mediators of PCC-associated thrombogenicity [16, 33] . In a comparison of various PCC preparations, the one used in our study was found to contain relatively small amounts of activated factor VII [34] . No thromboembolic episodes were observed in our patient population; however, our study had far too few patients and was not designed to assess clinical endpoints as the incidence of thromboembolic complications. Most complications were reported in association with repeated high doses of PCCs and concomitant risk factors like major surgery or crash injuries, and the use of aprotinin [35\u00b137] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 354, "text": "[6, 8, 23\u00b126]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 427, "end": 431, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 882, "end": 886, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1121, "text": "33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1269, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1664, "text": "[35\u00b137]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "With respect to laboratory findings on activation of plasma coagulation, we observed a significant increase in F 1+2 and TAT. F 1+2 is a measure of the cleavage of prothrombin by activated factor X being released from the amino-terminal portion of the molecule during its conversion to thrombin. Elevated levels, therefore, indicate intravascular thrombin formation. The same is true for TAT, which is formed by inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin in the case of thrombin formation [38] . Although the elevated levels of F 1+2 after infusion of PCCs were in part attributed to a certain amount of F 1+2 present in reconstituted PCCs [18] , the amount of the increase observed in our study and the concomitant increase in TAT levels make the exogenous administration of a large amount of F 1+2 unlikely [17] . The observed increase in both TAT and F 1+2 thus indicates in vivo thrombin generation and the presence of a prethrombotic state. A prethrombotic state can be defined as an imbalance in hemostasis with a tendency to hypercoagulability due to an activation of enzymes of the coagulation cascade without clinical signs of thrombosis or laboratory evidence of fibrin deposits [39, 40] . In biochemical terms, an increase in the enzymatic activity of factor Xa in thrombin formation (reflected by the elevation of F 1+2 and TAT levels) defines a prethrombotic state [40] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 489, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 805, "end": 809, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1189, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1193, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1378, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Since the coagulation cascade obviously was activated by infusion of PCCs, does this resemble DIC? According to the definition of DIC as a dynamic process involving thrombin and fibrin formation, DIC consists of (1) consumption coagulopathy leading to depletion of coagulation factors enhancing the risk of bleeding complications, (2) fibrinolysis, which could further aggravate bleeding, and, on the other hand, (3) hypercoagulopathy [41, 42] . Consumption coagulopathy and fibrinolysis may be present to different extents and do not necessarily parallel hypercoagulopathy. Thus, hypercoagulopathy without evidence of coagulation factor consumption and/or fibrinolysis may be a prodromal state of DIC, but in many cases resembles a prethrombotic or hypercoagulable state [41] . In our patients, a short peak of elevated markers indicating activation of the coagulation system leading to thrombin formation was observed, but neither prolonged consumption of thrombin nor a parallel increase in fibrinolytic activity could be found. D-dimer, a neoantigen formed as the result of plasmin digestion of cross-linked fibrin [43] , had increased, though not significantly, after 24 h but did not change during the hours following the peak of TAT and F 1+2 . Moreover, neither consumption of an inhibitor (antithrombin) nor consumption of not substituted coagulation factors or platelets could be observed. Therefore, our results resemble the definition of a prethrombotic state rather than DIC, and we cannot derive induction of DIC by PCC infusion from our data.
