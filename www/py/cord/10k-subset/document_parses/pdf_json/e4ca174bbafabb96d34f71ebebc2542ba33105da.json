As bacteria are able to adjust their metabolism to a less favourable environment, these gel compounds are more than sufficient to allow bacterial survival and multiplication [58, 59] . Even sealed US gel bottles must not be assumed to be sterile unless clearly stated on packaging. Whilst the risk of infection transmission through contaminated US gel appears to be generally low, several outbreaks related to medical gels have been published [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Therefore, recommendations are as follows: & Gels should be stored at room temperature. The multiplication of pathogens in gel bottles increases considerably when kept warm for patient comfort, thus turning bottle warmers into incubators [67] . Therefore, if gel warmers are used, only bottles for immediate use should be warmed. & The regular decontamination of any bottle warmer facilities in use is essential whilst considering manufacturers guidance. Electrical devices should be unplugged and devices may need to cool down prior to decontamination. & Gel bottles should not be stored upside down in warmers as the gel dispensing tip may become contaminated through patient contact or indeed through contact with pathogens surviving/multiplying at the bottom of warmers. & Only dry bottle warmers should be used as any liquids will become even more easily contaminated [59, 68] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 419, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 684, "end": 688, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 689, "end": 693, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 694, "end": 698, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 699, "end": 703, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 704, "end": 708, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1598, "text": "[59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1602, "text": "68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ultrasound gel"}, {"text": "Particular consideration should be given to examinations and procedures where the choice of sterile gel is indicated:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ultrasound gel"}, {"text": "& The use of sterile gel is highly recommended for all semi-critical and critical US procedures, such as transducer contact with mucous membranes, i.e., all endo-cavity US, contact with any body fluids, i.e., all major and minor US guided interventional procedures, and when scanning infected or broken skin and wounds. & The use of sterile gel is strongly advised outside as well as inside transducer covers due to high reported transducer cover perforation rates and possible porosity [55] [56] [57] .
