Also there are likely to be considerable reporting errors in a retrospective assessment of childhood illnesses, even when the patients' recollections are supplemented by parental information or records of general practitioners. Patients with MS may be better motivated to recall accurately the occurrence and timing of childhood infections than unaffected controls, and methodological factors in a retrospective study could lead to spurious differences in estimating ages of infection.
