The recent published trials about endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke concluded reporting significant results in terms of clinical improvement and functional outcome. Although the introduction of the stent-like retrievers for Mechanical Thrombectomy has been considered a breakthrough in the endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke, the higher recanalization rates are not linearly followed by increased rates of favorable clinical outcomes, that is the issue of the \"futile recanalization\". Therefore, a growing attention has been paid to the patients selection. The use of multimodality CT (with associated CT-A and CT-Perfusion), the use of MR, the developing importance of collaterals moved the concept of therapeutic window from a rigid temporal criteria to a biological one, modifying also the indications to both endovascular treatment and i.v. r-tPA administration.",

Despite advances in ICU care, mortality is stable and is about 30%. 50% of all patients die in day one and 60% in the first month. 80% of survivors have disabilities. In adults, excluding trauma, the most common cause is hypertension followed by amyloid in the elderly. Genetic causes are found in 40% of hypertension-related bleeds, 70% in amyloid, and up 50% of bleeds due to cavernomas. In presence of AVMS, only patients with HHT harbor a genetic component. MRI risk markers include mainly microbleeds (identified on SWI) which are seen in up to 80% of ICH patients. Microbleeds due to hypertension occur predominantly in the central brain (basal ganglia and thalami) and central cerebellum (dentate nuclei). ICH is a dynamic process characterized by expansion (40%) and edema. ICH leads to BBB disruption, local coagulopathies, inflammation, and ischemia. Both CT and MRI are 100% sensitive in the detection of ICH. Both modalities can identify the \"spot\" and \"swirl\" signs which portray a poor prognosis and signify active bleeding and/or underlying lesions. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CCA) is characterized by posterior and cortical microbleeds, SAH (central type), siderosis, and large ICH. Damage to the wall of the subarachnoid and cortical arteries is responsible for its clinical manifestations.",

While this reaction can range from mild to fulminating, encompassing a very wide clinical spectrum, it is important to recognize because changes in medical management may be necessary to prevent neurologic decline and even death. CNS-IRIS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the neuroradiologist can play a critical role in alerting the clinician to the possibility of this syndrome. RCVCS (Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome) is characterised by acute and severe headaches, with or without other acute neurological symptoms, associated with diffuse segmental constrictions of cerebral arteries that resolve spontaneously within 3 months.

Symptoms and findings often presents 1-3 weeks after infection and presents with typical subcortical and central white matter lesions, as well as in the gray-white matter junction but can also be seen in cortex, basal ganglia, thalami and in periventricular white matter and in the spinal cord. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disorder affecting the white and gray matter of the brain and spinal cord. In the acute setting the lesions might demonstrate contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion on MR imaging. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an autoimmune disorder occurring after an infection; gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infection or campylobacter jejuni infection. The disease affects predominately the periphery nervous system but lesions in pons, midbrain and brainstem are not unusual.

According to the 2015 Global Drug Survey most popular drugs include alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco. However, the use of amphetamines (e.g. XTC) and cocaine is on the rise, especially in young adults. Various drugs may cause central nervous system (CNS) complications. These complications include acute and chronic neurovascular complications, (toxic) leukoencephalopathy, atrophy, infection, changes in the corpus callosum, and other miscellaneous changes. Neurovascular complications constitute the most frequent drug related emergencies. They include both ischemic stroke, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage. Multiple drugs are associated with neurovascular complications (heroin, amphetamines, \u2026) but cocaine is the hallmark drug. Mechanisms of action contributing to cocaine-related ischemic strokes include direct vasospasm, enhanced platelet aggregation, cardioembolic sources, accelerated atherosclerosis, and cerebral vasculitis. Heroin-associated infarcts often involve the globus pallidus; 5%-10% of users have pallidal infarcts at presentation. In cases of intranasal cocaine administration, hemorrhagic complications are twice as common as ischemic stroke. Subarachnoid hemorrhage may be found as a result of aneurysm rupture, since 40%-50% of patients have aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is often located in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Also reperfusion hemorrhage from ischemic stroke may be observed, with increased risk of hemorrhage after concomitant use of cocaine with alcohol. Also prescribed medications (antibiotics, antiepileptics, \u2026) or medical therapies (immunosupressants, chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition, \u2026 can affect the CNS.

Visual loss can be acute or subacute and be associated with other symptoms and signs like pain or diplopia. A very precise clinical indication is fundamental for the choice of imaging protocol and to improve its diagnosis value. The features of visual field defect are particularly relevant to define the site and hence the possible pathogenetic causes. MRI is the modality of choice for the study of the visual pathways. Exceptions are those conditions such as head injury with visual loss in which CT is the first imaging procedure. Contrast enhancement is important in assessing most orbital disorders. MRI imaging protocol must be adapted to the area involved by the pathology; lesions affecting optic nerve in the orbital compartment must investigated using fat-sat sequences sequences in order to reduce the interference coming from orbital fat. Pathologic conditions involving intracranial optic nerve, chiasm, optic tracts must be focused on the sellar and parasellar area, including parenchimal and vascular structures therein located. Geniculate and retrogeniculate optic pathways alterations must be studied considering the adjacent brain structures.

According to the CSF bulk flow theory, hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between CSF formation and absorption, or a block at various locations in the major CSF pathway. Many theories on CSF dynamics in relation to hydrocephalus have been postulated, leading to different classification from that of communicating and noncommunicating (based on Dandy's theory), through that of nonobstructive and obstructive (Russell's theory), to the last multicategorical hydrocephalus classification (McHC), which involves eight different categorical sections, including cause, pathophysiology, and occurrence of shunt placement. Hydrocephalus may be due to many causes including birth defects, hemorrhages, infections, meningitis, tumors, head injuries, etc. Independently from the cause, acute hydrocephalus represents a clinical emergency, that requires prompt recognition/ therapy. In this scenario neuroimaging plays a key role from the identification, to the definition of the cause and during the follow-up. Starting from the description of the rules at the basis of intracranial pressure (Monro-Kellie's theory), definition, pathophysiology and classification of hydrocephalus will be briefly described. CT and MR imaging findings of acute hydrocephalus will be revised, highlighting the importance of a rational approach to the interpretation of CT/MR images (CSF compartments involved, entity of hypertension, etiology, etc.).

More specifically, 95% of all traumatic brain injuries below the age of 1 year-old are AHT. AHT is a comprehensive term reflecting head injuries related to child abuse. In AHT, the mechanisms of injury includes shaking, impact, or a combination of these mechanisms. Since AHT is part of a disease in which children are physically abused, the diagnosis is usually made based on a multidisciplinary approach. Hallmark of AHT are retinal hemorrhages (RH). The gold standard evaluation for RH is the dilated funduscopic examination (DFE) . Recently, the capability of SWI to depict RH has been shown. SWI may be particularly useful in those patients who cannot undergo DFE. Traumatic thrombosis, traumatic rupture and leaks of the bridging veins are also frequently observed in AHT. Subdural hematomas and brain edema are a nonspecific finding in AHT. Brain edema may result from apnea/arrest, vasospasm, suffocation, or strangulation. In this setting, the role of neuroimaging is to assess the extent of brain damage. Spinal hematomas may be present in AHT. Spinal hematomas are nonspecific. However, their presence may help in distinguishing a traumatic from non-traumatic intracranial subdural hematoma. In conclusion, after this lecture the attendees should be able to identify the main neuroimaging features of AHT including RH, subdural hematomas, brain and spine injury.",

Radiological evaluations play an important role in the diagnosis, subsequent treatment and also treatment monitoring of all the brain infections Meningitis is a pathological process involving diffuse inflammation of the membranes (pia-arachnoid mater and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or duraarachnoid mater or both) surrounding the brain and spinal cord and may be caused by any of the common infectious agents including bacteria, fungi, viruses. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis and the treatment monitoring. Unenhanced MR examinations of patients with early meningitis may be unremarkable. Contrast is essential and improves the sensitivity particularly in the early phase and the specificity. Postcontrast images demonstrate the abnormal meningeal enhancement. Thickening of the meninges, obliteration and contrast enhancement of subarachnoid space are differentiating findings of advanced meningitis. Imaging has also plays a major role to demonstrate and to diagnose the development of complications, including infarction, cerebritis, abscess, subdural empyema or effusion, hydrocephalus, ventriculitis, myelitis and vasculopathy.

Acute encephalitides are diffuse non-focal brain parenchymal inflammatory disease. They can involve the meninges. Pathologically the primary features of viral encephalitis include neuronal degeneration and inflammation with or without mass effect. The etiology: HSV, HIV, Papovavirus, Arbovirus, Enterovirus, Toxoplasma, fungi, Listeria, Slow virus encephalitides as SSPE, Rasmussen, Prion disease as Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by DNA virus of 95% HSV-1. Significant morbidity is high with significant mortality. There is predilection for limbic system (temporal lobes, cingulum, subfrontal region). It is unilateral initially and turns to bilateral in the advancing stage and causes hemorrhagic, necrotizing encephalitis. MRI shows gyral edema with hypointensity on T1WI, high signal on T2WI, mass effect, patchy enhancement, petechial hemorrhages. Putamen is usually spared. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) occurs several years after measles infection. It is common in children and young adults between 5-12 years old. Patchy demyelination and gliosis present in the WM, basal ganglia, cerebellum, pons.

MR Neurography, a tissue-selective imaging, based on T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression, directed at identifying and evaluating characteristics of nerve morphology, has been widely used for the evaluation of traumatic injuries, nerve entrapment syndromes and nerve tumors. The development of high resolution 3D MR neurography techniques has significantly improved the radiological approach to the investigation of brachial plexus, due to enhanced contrast between nerves and muscles and multiplanar capabilities, which allow coronal MIP views with simultaneous display of the roots, primary trunks, divisions and cords of the brachial plexus. 3D MR neurography is especially useful for the investigation of immunemediated brachial plexopathies, which are characterized by different patterns of enlargement and increased signal intensity, whose identification may be relevant for the diagnosis. DTI is a novel technique which has been recently applied to the evaluation of peripheral nerve disorders. This technique is sensitive to subtle changes in tissue at the microstructural level and allows quantitative measurement of nerve microstructural integrity. DTI tractography has been successfully applied to the median nerve at the carpal tunnel and sciatic nerves, however it cannot be as readily and reliably performed in the investigation of brachial plexus for technical and anatomical reasons such as susceptibility and pulsation artefacts as well as motion of organs in the thorax. A standardized method for DTI tractography at 1.5T has been developed in our institution for the investigation of traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus, in which a reliable diagnosis of nerve root avulsion can be obtained with a functional rather than a conventional anatomic approach.

In addition, this correlation shows that the shape and orientation of the AVM-nidus conforms to the shape and orientation of the individual histogenetic unit involved by the AVM. Each of these units has its own vascular organization characterized by a principal and accessory arterial supply and venous drainage which provides the arterial supply and venous drainage of the AVM. Large AVM's expand the affected histogenetic unit but do not extend in adjacent units which become compressed and displaced. This indicates that histogenetic units have molecularly defined boundaries which are respected by enlarging AVM's. For the endovascular treatment of brain AVM's to be effective and safe, identification of the involved histogenetic unit, knowledge of its vascularization and targeting superselectively the nidus in order to achieve a strict intranidal deposition of a liquid, polymerizing embolic material is essential.

In adult life, high flow has been related to perinidal hypoxemia and, thus, arterial steal which may manifest itself with epilepsy, migraines, focal neurological symptoms or brain atrophy.

Perfusion imaging may demonstrate perilesional hypoperfusion with decreased cerebral blood flow and volume. Venous congestion can be due to a high input or a reduced outflow (secondary stenosis of the draining veins) and may go clinically along with cognitive decline, epilepsy, and neurological deficits.

Shifting from surgery to alternative therapeutical options has possibly allowed better results in complex cases, but also increased the percent of partially treated patients. For these reasons the Columbia University has conducted an international study (the ARUBA), aiming to evaluate the risks of active versus conservative treatment in patients with unruptured AVMs, through the application of a combined endpoint (death or \"symptomatic stroke\"), reached in 10.1% of patients managed conservatively versus 30.7% of patients submitted to (any kind of) treatment. Combining death with \"symptomatic stroke\" is debatable, because the term \"symptomatic stroke\" was applied also to mild or minimal symptoms. Since embolization is frequently associated with transient deficits and was the most frequent procedure in the active group, this has influenced the final results, with 14 patients having focal deficits -although reversible in 10versus one patient in the conservative group. Moreover, the risk of hemorrhage in the conservative group was negligible due to the short follow-up (average 33.3 months), although the risk of hemorrhage was calculated at 2.2 % per year. In summary, the ARUBA has confirmed that an incomplete treatment is linked with a worse outcome. As a consequence, a precise therapeutical strategy should be defined in the individual patient before starting treatment and should be pursued until complete exclusion of the AVM; this strategy must be discussed with the patient and the therapeutical risks explained, not omitting the undeniable risks of a conservative attitude (even for unruptured AVMs).",

Similar to their cerebral counterparts, SDAVF likely have to be seen as a consequence of localized thrombosis of venous structures close to the dural sack, such as epidural veins or radicular veins, followed by secondary ingrowth of neovascular meningeal vessels in view of clot resorption and organization attempts. In case there is a radicular venous connection to such a DAVF area, reflux towards the medullary venous system may develop and present as SDAVF. Biomechanical transduction of pulsatile arterialized flow in the medullary venous system encountering the pulsatile CSF environment are leading to thickening of the venous wall and increased narrowing of the normal radicular veins at the level of their exit towards the epidural venous system. Secondary to the development of a SDAVF, these processes may entail stepwise occlusion of normal radicular draining veins and in general lead to development of ascending venous hypertension of the spinal cord. Spinal cord T2 hypersignal corresponds initially to a disturbed reabsorption of CSF, facilitating chronic ischemic damage to the spinal cord and in case of further hindrance of the venous drainage and persisting SDAVF, may even induce venous infarction. Current MR quality may allow for discovering incidentally increased perimedullary vascularity and further evaluation with MRA or DSA may confirm presence of a SDAVF. At early stages, no venous congestion may yet exist, nevertheless, one can advocate to treat SDAVF already at this stage to avoid further damage to the medullary venous system.",

Makrofistulas between the vertebral artery and the jugular vein can be occluded with coils or the continuity of the artery can be reconstructed with either telescoping stents of with flow diverters. Paraspinal lesions with an angioarchitecture similar to an AVM can be occluded with injected polymer glue. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas are acquired lesions, located adjacent to the neuroforamen. The arteriovenous shunt to the epidural veins interferes with the perfusion of the myelon, resulting in edema of the myelon and progressive myelopathie. EVT is considered if the segmental artery from which the radiculomeningeal artery to the AV shunt originates, is independent from the pial supply of the myelon. For spinal dAVF with a common segmental origin of the feeding artery to the fistula and the myelon supply, microsurgery is mandatory.

This conjunction allow the combination of anatomical information, revealed from CT, and the functional informations from PET into one image with high fusion accuracy. Hybrid imaging by means of PET/CT has shown its potential in the evaluation of solid tumors as lung or colorectal cancer but did not lead to significant advantages in both neurological and neuro-oncological applications, where the use of CT (also with contrast media) covers a minor role. During the last years, several novel radiolabeled compounds have been developed and are actually used for in vivo evaluation of primary and secondary brain tumors (i.e. 18F FDOPA) or neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. 18F Florbetaben). The common denominator of these radiolabelled compounds is an high selectivity and specificity for the target, with a loss of background informations that could be used by nuclear medicine physicians as a surrogate of anatomical reference. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unmatched soft tissue details for brain studies and cover a major role in the diagnosis and follow-up of both neurodegenerative diseases and primary and secondary tumors of the brain. Additionally, since MRI provides also functional information such as blood oxygenation level dependant imaging or spectroscopy, the conjunction of PET with MRI (PET/MRI) could provide multi-functional information of physiological processes in vivo along with a reasonable array of functional informations through techniques such diffusion.

Developments of diagnostic imaging provides images more and more detailed than in the past. This allows the possibility of issuing higher doses to target volumes, increasing the preservation of healthy tissues and minimizing the dose to the critical organs. Molecular imaging influence the management of cancer patient, and assist the customizing of treatment. The positron emission tomography allows the visualization of molecular alterations in vivo, then it facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The definition of target volumes is based mainly on diagnostic imaging. CT Scan is the tool of choice (anatomical description of volumes and allows the dosimetric calculation). MR gives an excellent soft tissue contrast. PET allows the physiological information and displays the proliferative activity, the differentiation of necrotic regions from recurrence (important the timing in which is checked), the identification of hypoxic regions If target delineation is inaccurate, highly conformal radiation techniques such as IMRT is ineffective. Coregistration of CT with MRI provides important complementary information and overcomes some shortcomings of each individual modality (these structural imaging techniques have inherent limitations in their capacity to differentiate tumor from neighboring normal tissues). Much of the published literature has demonstrated that utilization of PET results in differences in the magnitude of the target volumes (mostly smaller volumes) and a reduction in interobserver variation. A better OARs definition is provided by MRI. One of the most controversial and as yet unresolved issues in applying PET/CT in radiation planning is the method used for edge definition. CT, MR, PET adds complementary information and their combined use is recommended. However physical examination must be incorporate as an essential step in precise GTV delineation. Additional histopathologic correlation studies as well as large multicenter prospective trials analyzing clinical outcomes are needed.",

LEAT includes neoplastic lesions identified in patients investigated for long histories (often 2 years or more) of drug-resistant epilepsy. They are generally slowly growing, low grade, cortically based tumors commonly arising in the temporal lobe. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) or other neuronal migration abnormalities often coexist Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed MRI study of 52 patients (age at surgery range 3-63 years) affected by pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent surgery in the period 2002 to 2014 for histopathologically confirmed LEAT (follow-up ranged from 1 to 13 years). The patients were also divided into 2 groups patients in Group A (6 cases) underwent to lesionectomy for extratemporal lesion, whereas patients in Group B (46 cases) underwent removal of the tumor and the adjacent epileptogenic zone (tailored surgery). Result: Gangliogliomas were predominant lesions found in 23 pts followed by pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (8 pts), gangliocytoma (4 pts), asto-oligoastrocytoma (8 pts), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (4 pts), melanocytoma (1 pt), neurocytoma (1 pt), papillary glioneuronal tumor (1pt), anglocentric glioma (2 pt), In 17 cases LEAT were associated with FCD. In this group, FCD was in 9 cases (53%) a FCD IIIb according to the last International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification (FCD I+EAT), whereas in 8 cases (47%) LEAT were associated with FCD type II (atypical association) In 1 case we observed an anaplastic progression. Conclusion: The correct MRI identification of the structural lesion (tumor and focal cortical dysplasia ) associated with an extensive neurophysiological study, are essential to draw a tailored surgical approach in order to obtain the best post-surgery seizure control. The main issue for neuroradiologists is trying to identify an associated FCD since its presence could change presurgical work up demanding a more extensive non invasive neurophysiological study (i.e video-EEG monitoring) to define the epileptogenic zone and to choose the best surgical strategy (lesionectomy vs \"tailored\" ",

In this work we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to assess and quantify possible brain microstructural changes in AMN. Purpose: Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the late-onset form of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a X-linked disease with a progressive axonal damage, consisting in a dying-back axonal degeneration of the long tracts of the spinal cord. In this work we present the application of advanced quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) methods to assess spinal cord structural and microscopic changes in AMN. Methods: Spine qMRI data of 13 AMN male patients and 12 ageand gender-matched controls were acquired at 3T (Achieva, Philips). The protocol included sagittal 3D-T1 Fast Field-Echo (FFE) and axial Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) acquisitions (b=600 s/mm\u00b2, 6 directions). Total cross-sectional area (TCA) was measured at all the intervertebral cervical disk levels and the upper thoracic levels down to T2-3, after reslicing the 3D-T1 FFE images orthogonally to the spinal cord using the software JIM6 (Xinapse Systems). Interoperator reliability was assessed. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial and radial diffusivity (MD, AD and RD) maps were computed at C2-3, C3-4 and C4-5 levels using the FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox (FSL). FA, MD, RD an AD values were evaluated both in gray (GM) and white matter (WM) using ROIs extracted by the MNI-poly-AMU template. Result: TCA was significantly reduced in patients at all explored levels (independent samples T-test after testing for normality, p<.0001); the relative reduction was more pronounced at the thoracic levels. There was an excellent interobserver reproducibility of TCA measurements (mean ICC: .995, p<.001). A significant reduction of WM FA (p<.0001) with a concomitant reduction of AD (p<.003) and increase of RD (p<.003) was observed at all the explored levels.

Residual abnormalities were seen at a higher rate compared to adults.These aspects may reflect differences in the vulnerable vascular areas in infants. We propose a change in nomenclature of PRES to Potentially Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome to reflect the findings of this study. The endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms has been steadily evolving over the last 25 years to a point where it has become a viable and safe alternative to surgical clipping. The introduction of the Guglielmi Detachable Coil (GDC) system in the early nineties was a significant step towards improving the predictability of the detachable system and thus the safety of occluding an aneurysm with an implantable device. Subsequently, several enhancements of the coil itself were introduced in a major effort to reduce the recanalization rates, especially in large or wide neck aneurysms. These enhancements consisted primarily of adding a suture material to the platinum or coating it with a hydrogel polymer in an effort to reduce the dead space, increase the production of smooth muscle cells and thus reduce the recanalization of soft thrombus. Unfortunately, several randomized studies failed to demonstrate any clear advantage of the surface-modified coils over bare platinum coils in reducing the recurrence rate especially in large and wide neck aneurysms.",

Various methods were used to retain the liquid polymer within the aneurysm including balloonassisted and stent-assisted techniques. Despite good anatomical results, these techniques have largely been abandoned due to difficulty in using them as well as the relatively high rate of inadvertent distal embolization, and stenosis/obliteration of the parent artery.",

            "text": "Meanwhile, early seminal studies had shown that the deployment of bare stents within the parent artery can lead to the progressive thrombosis and obliteration of experimental aneurysms without the need to implant an embolic material, coil or otherwise, inside the lumen of the aneurysm. Also, experience had shown that the deployment of bare metallic stents in the intracranial circulation was much easier than the navigation of covered stents which are usually large in diameter and too stiff to navigate. In addition, a group of investigators explored the hemodynamic effect of flow diversion on the intentional obliteration of in-vitro and experimental animal aneurysms. The investigators were able to scientifically and mathematically prove the beneficial effect of implanting a \"Flow Diverter\" stent in the parent artery across the neck of an aneurysm on the obliteration of that aneurysm. Thus the concept of flow diversion for the endovascular treatment of aneurysms was introduced. The flow diversion concept stipulates that the mere presence of a tightly woven stent-like device a cross the neck of an aneurysm will alter the flow in such a manner that it will lead to decoupling of the intraaneurysmal flow patterns from those inside the parent artery. Such a decoupling will lead to slowing and alteration of the intra-aneurysmal flow pattern ultimately leading to thrombosis. These changes induced by the flow diverter will happen with or without the presence of coils inside the lumen of the aneurysm.",

            "text": "Early clinical studies have shown positive results using the flow diversion techniques in the treatment of aneurysms both in the carotid as well as in the vertebro-basilar circulations. The technology has taken off dramatically first in Latin America and Europe and more recently in North America and Asia. Several improvements in the design and manufacturing of the devices have ensued leading to ever greater and increasing use. Despite the continuing success of the technology, several drawbacks and unexplained complications have become known and will need to be solved if not better understood. These include: the need to use dual antiplatelet therapy with all the inherent problems of this combination of drugs, unexplained aneurysmal rupture some of it fatal, unexplained remote cerebral parenchymal hemorrhages, etc. Although flow diversion techniques are rapidly being adopted for the treatment of side-wall aneurysms, the technology remains unsuited for the treatment of bifurcation aneurysms such as basilar tip, internal carotid bifurcation, etc. For this category of challenging aneurysms a new family of devices have been developed which consists of spherical or cylindrical shape implants made of braided metallic material (Web device, Luna device). These new implantable devices belong to the category of intra-aneurysmal flow diverters and are distinctly better suited for the treatment of bifurcation aneurysms. They have shown promising early clinical results, particularly in the treatment of acutely ruptured aneurysms where the use of dual antiplatelet therapy can be problematic. Since these implants do not extend into the parent artery, pre-treatment with antiplatelet therapy is theoretically not required. Other newer devices (Barrel stent, P Conus, etc.) are being introduced for the treatment of wide neck bifurcation aneurysms with the main purpose of avoiding the cumbersome and often challenging use of \"Y Stenting\". The construction of these devices is designed such to buttress the coils inside the aneurysm and to protect the parent artery and its various branches from inadvertent encroachment by the platinum coils. Current management standards for intracranial aneurysms will be reviewed in an interactive format with course participants. This will include the roles of angiography and embolization, surgical clip reconstruction and the role of following lesions conservatively. The continued coiling vs clipping debate will be explored as well as how this debate has now shifted to include flow diversion and the treatment of small aneurysms. Strategic decision making depending on aneurysm size, location, and morphology and how these factors influence the use of detachable coils, newer generation devices and flow diverters will be discussed. Lastly, an open discussion about controversies in aneurysm management including the continued use of coiling as a stand alone therapy, placement of coils in conjunction with flow diverters and the question of surgical clipping as a first line treatment in some geographical locations will be considered.",

The endovascular treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms has become a common therapeutic option in our neuroradiological departments, still sometimes representing a challenging problem for physicians and patients. From the clinical experiences in the last 20 years we know that not all aneurysms are suitable for coil embolization. Suitability depends on the size, anatomy, and location of the aneurysm. Large aneurysms or wide neck aneurysms are less likely to achieve total occlusion. They are also more prone to aneurysm recurrences and to complications such as coil compaction or parent vessel occlusion. Furthermore, aneurysms in the middle cerebral artery bifurcation are less suitable for coil embolization. However experience and technological advances have broadened the indications for endovascular treatment of all aneurysms of the anteriori circulation. Balloon-assisted coiling and stent-assisted coiling have been the main technological advancements that have made the treatment of previously uncoilable aneurysms feasible. Moreover today flow divertion devices can be considered in a new therapeutic strategy in some ruptured aneurysms of the anterior circulation. As with all intracranial aneurysms, complete angiographic occlusion remains the goal of care. Balancing the risks of thromboembolic complications with decreasing the risk of hemorrhage, especially in acutely ruptured aneurysms, represents an objective for interventional neuroradiologists.",

Complexity of an aneurysm case could be also coming not only from morphologic settings but also from clinical presentation of that particular aneurysm case.

According to these conditions, the endovascular treatment may be performed with simple coiling only in sporadic cases. In most of the cases the coiling should be assisted by balloon (overall in ruptured aneurysms) or stent (overall in unruptured aneurysms). In wide-necked aneurysms, a single stent may be insufficient to contain the coils within the sac, therefore, two stents in a Y-shape configuration or in parallel may be used. Some other devices to contain the coils have been introduced and these represent the evolution of the Y-stenting or Wafflecone technique, such as the PulseRider or the PConus, that are stent-like devices with intra-or extra-saccular deployment. In those cases in which an artery arises from the sac, a growing use of intra-saccular flow-disrtuptors has been observed, such as the WEB, or, in case of aneurysms larger than 1 cm the use of Flow Diverter stents is being widely considered. In the latter case, there could be a potential risk of hypoperfusion in cortical territories supplied by the branch that is covered by the stent and should be used only in those cases not treatable with surgical approach.",

            "text": "Complex aneurysms, which include giant and dolichoectatic aneurysms, are difficult to treat because conventional clipping techniques often fail. Other techniques are required, like complex clip reconstructions, aneurysm transection with thrombectomy, and bypass techniques. A microsurgical experience with 3600 aneurysms, including 197 giant aneurysms, is reviewed to demonstrate these surgical techniques and associated outcomes. Excellent results can be achieved with surgery, whereas endovascular therapy is limited by high rates of incomplete aneurysm occlusion, recurrence, rehemorrhage, and retreatment. Bypass Surgery Intracranial-to-intracranial (IC-IC) bypasses are alternatives to traditional extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) bypasses that reanastomose parent arteries, reimplant efferent branches, revascularize branches with in situ donor arteries, and reconstruct bifurcations with interposition grafts that are entirely intracranial. These newer bypasses represent an evolution in bypass surgery from using scalp arteries and remote donor sites towards a more local and reconstructive approach. We adopted a practice that utilizes IC-IC bypass preferentially when revascularization is needed in the management of complex aneurysms. Our experience with bypass for aneurysms was reviewed. During a 17-year period in which 3600 aneurysms were treated microsurgically in 2751 patients, 318 bypasses were performed, including 155 bypasses performed as part of aneurysm management and 70 IC-IC bypasses. Surgical techniques will be presented and associated outcomes were equivalent to traditional EC-IC bypasses. Adopting an IC-IC bypass approach requires experience in the operating room with simpler bypasses, confidence, and dedication to advancing the craft of bypass surgery. Surgical Approaches to Brainstem Cavernous Malformations Once considered inoperable lesions in inviolable territory, brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCM) are now surgically curable with acceptable operative morbidity. Recommending surgery is a difficult decision that would be facilitated by a grading system designed specifically for BSCMs that predicted surgical outcomes. Informed by our efforts to develop better grading systems for arteriovenous malformations (AVM), we hypothesized that a similar system might predict long-term outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. A consecutive, single-surgeon series of 130 patients was used to develop a grading system incorporating lesion size, location crossing the brainstem's midpoint, presence of developmental venous anomaly(DVA), age, and time from last hemorrhage to surgery. Rather than developing a grading system for all CMs that is weak with BSCMs, we propose a system for the patients who need it most. The BSCM grading system differentiates patients who might expect favorable surgical outcomes and offers guidance to neurosurgeons forced to select these patients.",

The today available flow diverters are dense braided mesh tubes with self-expanding features. The various products (SILK and SILK+, PED and PED FLEX, p64, FRED, SURPASS et al.) differ in material, radial force, flexibility, radioopacity and mesh density. Based on an institutional experience since 9/2009 in >600 patients treated with either PED (FLEX) or p64 or a combination thereof, the following conclusions can be drawn. Flow diversion (FD) is not a generic name, it is device specific. FD became our method of choice for the treatment of sidewall aneurysms. FD is less efficient for bifurcation aneurysms, but works well in selected situations. Fusiform aneurysms can be treated with FD, but their biology differs from saccular aneurysms, which has to be addressed. FD can be used in the anterior and posterior circulation. The treatment of acute and chronic neurovascular dissections and of direct carotid cavernous sinus fistulas benefits from the use of flow diverters. Large and giant aneurysms should be coiled either prior or during FD. The procedural complication rate is low. Dual antiaggregation is mandatory and has to be individualized. One year after FD, an efficacious flow diverter will have occluded >80% of all saccular aneurysms. In-stent stenosis is infrequent and a transient phenomenon in the majority of patients. Follow-up examinations and eventual re-treatment are essentialas with all other treatment modalities for intracranial aneurysms.",

            "text": "A.GENERAL The vertebral column is the most common location for bone metastasis and metastases are the most common tumors of the spine (HARRINGTON 1986 , SHAH et al. 2011 ). Osseous metastases are over ten times more common than primary bone tumors. In 50% of cancer patients bone metastases occur, 40-70% of which are found in the vertebrae. Ten percent of patients with a malignant neoplasm have vertebral metastases (SCHIFF et al. 1997) . In no less than 10-40% of these patients the metastatic lesions are responsible for the first symptoms, e.g. compression fracture or neurological symptoms. The presence of tumors cells causes osteoclastic and osteoblastic activation with subsequent osteolysis (70%), osteosclerosis (9%) or both (21%). The primary tumors are, in descending order, breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma, prostate carcinoma and gastrointestinal tumors (SCHICK et al. 2001 , HARRINGTON 1986 ). B.IMAGING Imaging has multiple purposes regarding metastases. In the first place imaging is used to detect lesions and assess their location. It can, however, also be very valuable in evaluation of different therapeutic options (ANDREULA & MURRONE 2005) . When it comes to detection of metastases in the osseous spine, MRI is more sensitive than MDP scintigraphy (ALGRA et al. 1991) . MRI is positive in 15% of negative bonescans and detects 20% more lesions in patients with positive bone scans. It will also be negative if there is no osteoblastic turnover within the lesion, as seen in some lung and breast tumors. Still bone scintigraphy has a relatively high sensitivity and is as such a useful tool for screening asymptomatic cancer patients. Since high osteoblastic turnover is absent in some lung and breast tumor metastases, some authors recommend MRI for screening (STEINBORN et al. 1999 , LAYER et al. 1999 . CT is not suited as a screening technique because of the use of ionising radiation. It can be used to confirm a suspected lesion on scintigraphy, showing trabecular or cortical bone destruction but also invasion of paraspinal tissues. MRI is the recommended imaging tool in case of neurological symptoms and is capable of whole spine investigation. Osteolytic lesions will display low signal intensity on T1-WI because of the high contrast of tumor (hypointense) with fatty bone marrow (hyperintese). A corresponding high signal on T2-WI is usually noted. On fat suppression sequences like STIR the hyperintense tumor contrasts nicely to the suppressed surrounding bone marrow, making this sequence very sensitive (MEHTA et al. 1995) . Furthermore negative STIR excludes metastasis and makes the use of a contrast medium unnecessary (MAHNKEN et al. 2005) . Another feature of lytic lesions is the loss of out-ofphase signal decrease. In contrast osteosclerotic metastases have low signal intensity on both T1-WI and T2-WI. In case of an infiltrating component a high signal on T2-WI may be seen. When the tumor destructs the vertebral cortex, the normal hypo intense vertebral lining is lost. After the administration of a gadolinium-chelate osteolytic metastases will enhance prominently, sclerotic lesions will show a more heterogeneous, peripheral enhancement. An advantage of the use of contrast is the improved evaluation of extraosseous components. The ADC calculated from diffusion-weighted MR images is probably a reliable parameter to distinguish vertebral metastases from normal vertebrae (HERNETH et al. 2002) . In a recent study Whole-body DW-MR imaging is said to be more sensitive in the detection of osseous metastases than skeletal scintigraphy and CT bone survey (DEL VESCOVO et al. 2014 ).",

The main symptoms are hypercalcemia, renal impairment, cytopenia/anemia and bone disease -summarized as CRAB-criteria. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by asymptomatic premalignant stages called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma. These stages also present with detectable monoclonal protein and/or monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow but do not show any end organ impairment. Staging of multiple myeloma is based on the measurement of the monoclonal protein in serum and urine as well as the assessment of impairment of hematopoiesis, renal function and mineralized bone. In the last decade the development of novel therapeutic agents has led to an increase in response rates and survival time of patients with multiple myeloma, which further stresses the value of response assessment by imaging. Cross sectional imaging like MRI, CT and PET/CT is currently replacing conventional radiological surveys in the initial work-up and follow-up of patients with monoclonal plasma cell diseases. Recent studies demonstrate the added value of (whole-body) MRI to improve initial staging by unraveling a diffuse infiltration of bone marrow by plasma cells, a focal pattern or a combination of both. Also, PET/CT can detect response to therapy earlier than conventional response criteria. Furthermore, recent studies revealed that a complete remission of multiple myeloma confirmed by MRI or PET/CT goes along with a better prognosis compared to a complete response based only on serological parameters.",

They are associated with vascular disturbance (trauma), and in one third to another primary bone lesion. Genetic studies relate them to USP6 fusion genes, marking ABC as neoplastic rather than reactive. The exact mechanism still remains unknown. Most difficult histopathologic differential diagnosis is from telangiectatic osteosarcoma. ABC are vascularized, multiloculated with daughter cysts. They occur in the first two decades of life, usually around the knee and femur. Spine locations are about 20 percent, involving thoracic and cervical, often situated in the posterior elements. In the spine, clinical manifestation includes pain and acute cord compression. Imaging findings show in X-Ray and CT, an eccentric, lytic, expansile lesion with fluid-fluid levels (blood), mostly apparent under MRI. There are multiple internal septa and cortical thinning. Most common treatment is surgical removal and bone grafting, although there is an important risk of recurrence. In these cases, the option of minimal invasive treatments is available. Initial endovascular arterial embolization reduces blood supply, allowing bone healing. Different agents have been used, to achieve distal and permanent effect. Another approach is direct intraosseous injection of sclerotics to destroy the vasculature. Additionally, injectable osteoconductive pyrophosphate materials are used, for primary bone stability. Other options include ablation, for vascular destruction and thrombosis. The strategy behind all these techniques is to destroy the abnormal vasculature and in the same time provide transient structural support to allow for bone healing, regeneration and recalcification of the pathologic area.",

OO larger than 15 mm is denominated osteoblastoma (OB). OB is four times less frequent than OO and may have a more aggressive imaging and histological pattern. Therapy is required both in OO and OB because of severe bone pain independent from physical strain that typically worsens at night, especially in OO. Computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an efficient method to treat OB, even in case of (juxta-)articular localizations. The successful treatment of OB Purpose: To declare death in a patient with coma, the absence of brain stem reflexes and breathing drive must be confirmed by neurological examination. In certain situations, termed as confounding conditions, complete and reliable clinical assessment cannot be performed. In such cases, ancillary tests confirming cerebral circulatory arrest (CCA) are helpful. The existing methods have a number of significant limitations. The advent of CT scanners capable of covering over 8 cm in z-axis (9.6cm z-axis coverage for the scanner used in this study, leading to the term \"volume perfusion CT\" [VPCT]) enables an assessment of the whole brain perfusion. This method would potentially constitute a better alternative to the existing ancillary tests. However, VPCT for the diagnosis of CCA has not been evaluated in a quantitative study up to date. The aim of the study was to assess the sensitivity of VPCT for the confirmation of CCA in the diagnosis of brain death (BD). Methods: The studied population was recruited from adult patients, who fulfilled the standard clinical criteria of BD. All subjects underwent VPCT using a 128-slice multidetector CT scanner. CBF and CBV values were calculated using deconvolution algorithm in ROIs covering brain stem, cerebellar hemispheres, cortico-subcortical regions of the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes and in the basal ganglia.",

Purpose: Causes of subcortical hematoma can be divided into primary hemorrhages, such as hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and amyloid angiopathy, and secondary hemorrhages, most commonly cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) rupture. If there is cerebrovascular involvement, vascular lesions must be treated to prevent rebleeding or hematoma growth, so searching for the precise location of the source of bleeding as early as possible is essential. We performed a retrospective study on the capacity of 320-detector row computed tomography (CT) scanners to detect vascular lesions in cerebral subcortical hematomas, particularly using whole-brain four-dimensional CT angiography (4D-CTA Methods: We prospectively studied 41 patients aged between 23 and 91(mean 70\u00b116) with symptoms of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion within 9 hours of symptoms onset. Noncontrast CT (NCCT), CT-angiography and Perfusion-CT were performed in all patients. Either NCCT or MRI was performed during the follow-up, as control. For perfusion CT, colored CBV, CBF and TTP maps were generated. Two readers, one with 15-year experience in neuroradiology and one radiology resident, separately rated the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS), on NCCT, perfusion CT (CBV, CBF and TTP) as well as on control CT/MRI. Interobserver agreement was measured, for each imaging modality using weighted Cohen \u03ba statistic. NCCT, CBV, CBF and TTP ASPECTS were correlated to final infarct extent based on control CT/MRI using Spearman rank test. The sensitivity and specificity were determined for both NCCT and PCT using the follow-up imaging as the standard of reference.",

Most of them were treated 5 to 10 days after TIA / stroke. 6 hours after intervention no patient had a worsened NIHSS, 6 patients had improved in the NIHSS (p = 0.03) and 84 were unchanged. Mortality, major, and minor stroke until discharge were 0. Only 38 patients (42%) received the planned MRI before and after CAS. 14 patients (37%) showed new lesions of about 3 to 5 mm in the diffusion weighted MRI (11 patients 1 or 2 spots, 3 patients 3 and more). 2/3 of the lesions were within the borders of the initial perfusion deficit. Perfusion was ipsilaterally normalized except in previous infarcted areas. 13 % of the patients had restenosis > 50% after 6 months, no surgical or endovascular therapy was performed. Methods: Endovascular recanalization was attempted in 14 patients with symptomatic 11 ICA occlusions and 3 VA occlusions. The duration of the occlusion ranged from 10 days to 6 months (mean, 2.5 months), and the mean length of the occlusion was 95 mm. Cerebral hemodynamics ipsilateral to the side of the occlusion were severely impaired in all patients. The endovascular procedure was performed under total cerebral circulatory protection, beginning with proximal protection with a subsequent switch to distal protection (in 11 cases ) after successful guide wire passage. Result: The occlusion was recanalized successfully in 12 out 14 of patients (85.7%), resulting in improvement of ipsilateral cerebral hemodynamics without symptomatic stroke. Small asymptomatic ischemic lesions were detected in 3 of 14 patients (21%) on DWI, and 1 patient developed a mild groin hematoma. Ischemic episodes did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 19 months. However, 2 patients experienced asymptomatic reocclusion, which was retreated successfully without complications due to failure maintenance of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. Purpose: Inflammation of the periodontal space is a common chronic disease of the teeth apparatus, which leads to resorption of the alveolar bone. Periodontitis is the second most frequent disease of the mouth. The association between periodontitis and atherosclerosis has already been shown in many studies. Many risk-factors for the periodontal disease are also proatherogenic and therefore it is difficult to proof if periodontitis acts directly as an indipendent risk-factor for atherosclerosis. In this retrospective computer-tomography (CT) study we analysed a possible causal relationship between periodontitis and atherosclerosis of the carotid artery (CA). Methods: CT-angiographies of the head and neck region of 71 patients were retrospectively analysed (GE VCT-64, SD:0,625mm, I:0,4mm, 80kV, 375mA). Patients were divided in two groups on the basis of signs of advanced periodontitis in bone window (peridontitis: n=36; 20men; mean age 69\u00b112yno periodontitis: n=21; 7men; mean age 65\u00b114y). Patients without teeth (n=14) were excluded. Atherosclerosis and stenosis of the CA at the bifurcations were quantified. For each patient cardiovascular risk-factors, as arterial hypertonus, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and nicotin abuse, were documented. Result: The two groups did not show any differences in cardiovascular risk-factors. Atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation was significantly more frequent in patients with periodontitis (p<0,01), with an higher prevalence of stenosis >50%. In the periodontitisgroup 20 of 36 patients had a stenosis >50% at the origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA), 6 of them bilateral. In the controlgroup without signs of peridontitis only 1 of 21 patients showed a single proximal ICA stenosis >50% (p<0,01). Patients with periodontitis showed a mean stenosis of the ICA of 59\u00b120%, more often with mixed atheromatous plaques (75%) and less frequently only calcified plaques (20% The examinations were carried out twice within the following periods: in the course of the first two weeks (at the time of admission), and after two months.

The first studies of 18F-FDG PET utilization in patients with vertebral infection have shown high sensitivity but variable specificity (35.8%-87.9%). FDG-PET was at the beginning a promising technique for the diagnosis of bone infections based on the intensive consumption of glucose by mononuclear cells and activated granulocytes. 18F-FDG seems to be a good radiopharmaceutical showing high sensitivity and specificity but unfortunately its use may have limitations in distinguishing uncomplicated bone healing from osteomyelitis. Furthermore, 18F-FDG as well as 99mTc-diphosphonate with 67Ga-citrate, suffer from some other limitations as non-negligible radiation burden, long acquisition time and high costs. Radionuclide imaging is however strongly recommended to assess disease activity during follow-up after medical therapy. Due to low specificity for vertebral infection of the commercially available radiopharmaceuticals, alternative experimental radiotracers, such as radiolabeled antibiotics (99mTcciprofloxacin) and radiolabeled vitamin (111In-Biotin) have been developed, in particular 111In-Biotin scintigraphy has shown very high sensibility (90%) and specificity (93%) to detect early vertebral infection in a large consecutive series of patients. 111In-Biotin scintigraphy, with SPECT/CT acquisition, has shown permanent high values of accuracy other than the advantage to distinguish bone involvement from soft tissue involvement infection.",

The MRS and APT techniques in combination provided in all case of lowgrade gliomas adequate image contrast that enabled biopsy of the metabolic hot-spot. Conclusion: Our initial results show that the implementation of APT, MRS and PET on hybrid MR-PET imaging is feasible for comprehensive metabolic mapping with the potential to increase the diagnostic accuracy and aid in staging and surgical planning for patients with brain tumors. Result: Intraoperative RS-fMRI in anesthetized patients proved to be feasible and analysis revealed no significant differences in preoperative z-scores between the sensorimotor areas ipsi-and contralateral to the tumor. Significant decrease of z-scores (P<0.01) was shown in patients with postoperative neurological deficits. The ipsilateral intraoperative zscore had a significant negative correlation with the degree of paresis immediately after the operation (r=-0.67, P=0.0001) (short-term paresis) and after the discharge from the hospital (r=-0.65, P=0.0001) (mid-term paresis). ROC curve analysis demonstrated moderate prognostic value of the intraoperative z-score (AUC: 0.84) for the mid-term paresis score. The contralateral to tumor z-scores (pre-and intraoperative ones) were not significantly correlated to the short-and mid-term clinical findings. Purpose: We hypothesized that the quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value within a voxel containing viable tumor may change or remain stable after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, reflecting tumor progression or stable disease. Accordingly, evaluation of serial differences in ADC using parametric response map (PRM) analysis maybe more sensitive than single time point ADC for the prediction of treatment response in glioblastoma patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic superiority of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parametric response (ADCPR) for predicting glioblastoma treatment response, compared to single time point measurement.",

ADCPR significantly improved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.67 to 0.88 and from 0.70 to 0.92 for both readers, respectively, compared to ADC10 at 3 months follow-up studies but did not significantly improve at 1 year follow-up studies. The interreader agreement was higher for ADCPR than ADC10 (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.93 versus 0.86). Conclusion: Voxel-based ADCPR appears to be a superior potential imaging biomarker to single time point measurement of ADC for predicting early treatment response in glioblastoma patients who showed enlarging contrast-enhancing lesions during the follow-up study. Therefore, PRM analysis may provide more accurate information for the prediction of patients likely to progression on short-term follow-up, thereby improving treatment selection and patient outcome. Purpose: Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging by means of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) has been proposed as an adjunct to conventional MRI, specifically to distinguish high from low grade glioma and to differentiate between tumour recurrence and radiation injury. With data currently confined to high field imaging, animal models, and/or limited parenchymal coverage, the purpose of this study is to assess APT imaging in a clinical setting. Methods: Patients under follow up for histopathologically proven glioma were considered eligible with informed consent obtained in all. Exclusion criteria were lesions <1cm and large susceptibility artefacts. Imaging was performed using a 3T 3DGRE CEST sequence (Achieva, Philips, Best/NL) with 38 alternate offsets running from +/-4.5ppm to 0 and B1 power of 2uT. Ten 5 mm slices were acquired in 7:30 mins supplemented by conventional volumetric sequences. Colour display (window of +/-5%) voxel-wise APT maps were obtained by calculating MTR asymmetry with a corrected spectrum at an offset of 3.5 ppm. For quantification, one region of interest (ROI) was placed in a representative tumour slice with a comparative ROI in contralateral normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Result: Ten patients were prospectively included in 2014/15 (WHO grade II in 3, III in 3, and IV in 4) following standard treatment by surgical resection, with or without radiation and/or chemotherapy. The APT sequence coverage was overall sufficient for tumour imaging. APT maps could be constructed in 8 patients: In 1 patient excessive artefacts, and in another incomplete data prevented mapping. Most APT maps showed artefacts in the periventricular area, presumably reflecting CSF pulsation. High APT signal was evident in enhancing lesions, in T2w-hyperintense areas and occasionally remote from the primary in NAWM. Notably, high APT signal was also seen in resection cavities. (37), to other post-contrast enhancement perfusion methods (10), to the lesion morphology, and to follow up results (12). The normalized rTBF values for the lesions in the same anatomical region were compared, at the significant level set to p<0.05. Result: The pcASL method allowed characterizing all the enrolled lesions. Moreover, there was a significant rTBF difference between cerebellopontine angle schwannoma and meningioma and between schwannoma and metastasis. For pituitary lesions, there was a significant difference between pituitary adenoma and meningioma. For jugular foramen region, there was a significant difference between paraganglioma, chondrosarcoma, and cholesteatoma. Interestingly, one case of osteomyelitis, showed a pseudotumoral increased rTBF, and a plasmocytoma under treatment, showed low rTBF, in relation with treatment response. Conclusion: The present preliminary study shows the interest of pcASL-MRI in evaluating tumor perfusion in the tumors that are located in the skull-base region. Moreover, pcASL can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of the tumors in this region without using contrast materials. Purpose: To perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic value of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), normalised apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and the spectroscopy metrics choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratio and choline/N-acetyl aspartate (Cho/NAA) ratio as imaging biomarkers for brain gliomas and metastases differentiation.",

We used random effects model to obtain weighted averages and area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for thresholds between high-and low grade gliomas (HGG, LGG) and metastases. Purpose: Treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations associated with high-flow fistula is still challenging assignment by means of stereotactic radiosurgery and surgical treatment. Although AVMs accompanied by high flow fistula increase the incidence of perioperative complications, many endovascular innovations make treatment of AVM advance. Therefore, the endovascular occlusion of those high-flow shunts plays an important role in complete obliteration of AVM with multimodal therapy. We report two cases of AVM with different type of fistula, which were treated with double arterial catheterization technique with coils. Methods: Two male patients in their forties have brain arteriovenous malformations associated with high-flow fistulas. One was detected cerebral AVM with fistulous component incidentally and another presented with intracranial hemorrhage. The latter harbored a high-flow fistula neighboring nidus. Fistulas of both patients were occluded with coils and glue by double catheters technique and niduses were embolized with staged manner. Two Marathon Flow Directed Microcatheters(Covidien, Irvine, Calif) were delivered just proximal or beyond the fistula in a same feeder and through one catheter ED coil(Kaneka Medix Co., Osaka, Japan) placed near fistula and keep the coil undetached. The flow of feeding artery was reduced significantly because of the coil and fistula was occluded with coils and glue from another catheter safely. Result: ED coils have so flexible delivery wires enough to place the coils through Marathon catheter, which was navigated to long tortuous feeding artery. Obliteration of high flow shunt was acquired by double catheter technique without difficulty. No additional neurological deficit was occurred after obliteration of fistula and embolization of nidus. Surgical removals were followed in two weeks after final embolization resulted in excellent outcomes. Purpose: Meningiomas are the most common benign intracranial neoplasm. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment. They are mostly hypervascular and preoperative endovascular embolization is aimed at reducing blood supply via the dural arterial feeders, but there is no consensus on the indications and this procedure is a controversial topic. Aim of this study is to review our single-center experience to assess the efficacy of the endovascular technique. Methods: We retrospectively compared patients with intracranial meningiomas who underwent preoperative embolization (with particles of polyvinyl alcohol) followed by radical resection (group 1), with a control group of patients operated without preliminary embolization (group 2) at our institution from January 2006 to June 2014. Comparisons between groups were made on the basis of surgical time and intraoperative blood loss in order to assess the usefulness of the endovascular procedure.",

Purpose: Minimally invasive treatment of spinal metastatic lesions has been limited by access and tumor location. Concerns of tumor extravasation and post radiation therapy fracture have recently advocated for a combined tumor ablation before cement augmentation. Tumor debulking has been advocated in recent reports before cementation. This study reports multicenter clinical and imaging outcomes following t-RFA and cement augmentation in spine malignant lesions. Methods: An IRB approved retrospective multicenter study of 74 patients (106 vertebral lesions) with spinal metastatic lesions evaluated an articulating bipolar RF ablation system designed for minimally invasive procedures in the axial skeleton with thermocouples embedded along the length of the articulating segment to real-time assess the size of the ablation zone. Visual Analogue Pain score (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were obtained pre-and 2-4 weeks post-treatment. Pre and post procedure MRI and PET scans were also evaluated. Result: Myeloma, breast, lung cancer comprised 31%, 26% and 20% of tumor etiology, respectively. All procedures were performed safely with no complications or thermal injury. Mean ablation time was 3.5 \u00b1 2.2 min (range 1 -15). Mean volume of cement delivered was 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 cc (range 1-6). Mean VAS scores dropped from 8.1 \u00b1 2.3 pre-procedure to 3.5 \u00b1 2.6 post-procedure (p<0.0001). Mean ODI scores improved from 29.3 \u00b1 11.2 to 18.4 \u00b1 10.3 post-procedure (p<0.0001) representing a categorical and clinically significant (>10%) improvement in disability. A predictable pattern of decreased tumor volume and an enhancing rim was observed in post contrast MRI imaging after ablations procedures in 13 lesions imaged. All metabolically active lesions in pre procedure PET scan (8 lesions) showed decrease activity after ablation. Similar findings were also seen in bone scan (3 lesions) Conclusion: t-RFA followed by vertebral augmentation in malignant spinal lesions resulted in pain and functional status improvement, with no significant complications. Articulation permitted reproducible transpedicular access to vertebral lesions regardless of location. TCs allowed accurate monitoring of the ablation zone to avoid complications of nearby neural elements. Post procedure MRI and PET could be helpful to monitor tumor growth in determining response and timing of adjunctive therapy.",

            "text": "Metastasis,Radiofrequency ablation,Spien Purpose: One of the main risks associated with vertebral augmentation is cement leakage and the potential damage this may cause. A proposed benefit of kyphoplasty is that it may help reduce leakage by creating a void into which low viscosity cement can be injected under low pressure so that cement is localised to the site of fracture. This study investigated whether differences in cement distribution within the vertebral body were apparent after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were used to treat severe vertebral compression fractures. Methods: Pairs of thoracolumbar \"motion segments\" from seventeen cadavers (70-97 yrs) were compressed to failure in moderate flexion and then cyclically loaded using a technique that consistently created severe vertebral wedge deformity in one of the vertebral bodies. One of each pair of motion segments from the same spine underwent vertebroplasty and the other kyphoplasty. For both treatments, a bipedicular technique was used which involved injecting 7 ml (3.5 ml per pedicle) of treatmentspecific cement into the centre of the vertebral body, adjacent to the depressed endplate. Specimens were then creep loaded at 1 kN for 1 hour to simulate mobilisation after treatment. The augmented vertebral body then underwent micro-CT scanning to quantify and compare regional cement distribution. Result: Percentage cement fill for the whole vertebral body showed no significant difference between treatments (vertebroplasty:19.8%, kyphoplasty:18.0%). However, regional differences were apparent. Pooled data for both groups showed a greater percentage fill in the anterior than posterior half of the vertebral body (26% vs 13% respectively, P<0.001) and in the middle compared to superior (P<0.001) and inferior (P<0.001) thirds (29% vs 14% and 11% respectively). Comparisons between groups showed that posterior fill was greater following vertebroplasty than kyphoplasty (16% vs 10%, P<0.001), as was fill in the inferior third of the vertebral body (14% vs 9%, P<0.001). Conclusion: Greater posterior and inferior cement fill following vertebroplasty suggests a more widespread distribution of cement. Successful vertebral augmentation requires accurate placement of cement that is localised at the site of fracture to support the depressed endplate, and these results suggest that kyphoplasty is better able to achieve this. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the injectable calcium sulphate / hydroxyapatite bone composite on the fracture rate of the \"sandwich vertebra\" in the treatment of osteoporotic VCF. Methods: We performed a prospective study of all consecutive patients with sandwich level fractures, who underwent vertebroplasty with a calcium sulphate / hydroxyapatite composite between december 2010 and october 2014 (10 patients). Fracture rate of the sandwich vertebra after vertebroplasty was noted and vertebral height in the immediate postoperative period and the one year follow up were compared. The level of pain was always evaluated by the VAS-scale at the moment of augmentation procedures, after about two week from the augmentation and at the final follow-up. Result: In 10 consecutive cases only one adjacent fracture of a sandwich vertebra was noticed. There was no or a slight decrease in vertebral height in 9 patients while only in a patient a fracture of the sandwich vertebra was seen after about three week from the first treatment. The mean pain level was included between 7 and 10 in the VAS Scale at the moment of augmentation treatment, decreasing in a range between 4 to 7 after about two week while after one year the VAS Scale was in a range 0-3. Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) are found in a significant proportion of the normal elderly population. The detection of cerebral microbleeds is strongly influenced by the MR parameters used, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) being more sensitive than T2* weighted imaging. Numerous medical conditions have been associated with cerebral microbleeds but the two main aetiologies are two distinct types of small vessel disease: hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The regional distribution of the CMB is a key factor for distinction between these two entities. In hypertensive small vessel disease the CMB are predominantly infratentorial and in the basal ganglia, whereas in CAA their location is more peripheral, often in the parietal and occipital lobes. More recently other imaging features of CAA have been described. These include cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semi-ovale, and confluent white matter hyperintensities in the posterior part of the brain. Clinical presentations of CAA include symptomatic intracerebral (lobar) haemorrhage, focal transient neurological symptoms, cognitive impairment, and in some cases rapidly progressive cognitive and neurological decline. The latter can be associated with an inflammatory response, showing vasogenic oedema on MRI that improves after steroid treament. The distinction between hypertensive arteriopathy and CAA, based on the distribution of CMB and additional imaging features of CAA is clinically important as the two conditions differ in their prognosis and are likely to impact on treatment choices in future. Recurrent haemorrhage is more frequent in CAA, particularly in there is also evidence of cSS. Treatment with antiplatelet, antithrombotic and thrombolytic agents appears to carry a higher risk of symptomatic haemorrhage in patients with CAA.",

Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology, signal change and cerebral atrophy visible on structural MRI can be used to identify diagnostically relevant imaging features, which provide support for clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. While no structural imaging feature has perfect sensitivity and specificity for a given diagnosis, there are a number of imaging characteristics which provide positive predictive value and help to narrow the differential diagnosis. While neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate scan interpretation, there is much that a non-radiologist can gain from a focused and structured approach to scan analysis.

There are a wide range of ASL sequences, which are completely noninvasive, not needing any exogenous tracer, using the blood as an endogenous tracer. ASL measurements can be repeated as many times needed and have excellent temporal and spatial resolutions. The two major common steps for ASL techniques are: the labeling and the readout. Initially, the water blood molecules are labeled magnetically by applying a radiofrequency inversion pulse. After a period time (arterial transit time) the labeled blood reaches the region of interest and the brain images are obtained. The difference between the images obtained with (tag) and without (control) labeled blood, produces the perfusion map. There are many different labeling schemes (CASL-continuous_ASL, PASL-pulsed_ASL, pCASL-pseudo-Continuous_ASL, Vessel-selective-VSASL, Velocityencoded-VEASL) and readout sequences available. The major ASL techniques limitations are the low signal-to-noise and the dependent on the arterial arrival times, which may be altered in several diseases, namely the cerebrovascular diseases. ASL has been used for the evaluation of vascular territories and collateral circulation, to evaluate the brain perfusion in acute stroke and arterial stenosis / occlusion, and to depict AVMs and dAVFs.

            "text": "The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging in some cases, as there is no single test (including biopsy) that can provide a definite diagnosis. However, with the availability of expensive diseasemodifying treatments that are thought to be particularly effective in the early phases of the disease but can be associated with serious side effects, achieving a prompt, accurate MS diagnosis is more imperative than ever. The high sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in depicting brain white matter and spinal cord plaques has made this technique the most important paraclinical tool in current use for the diagnosis of MS. However, many imaging abnormalities seen in MS patients are not specific to the disease. Therefore, the differential diagnosis has become a central issue. The perivenular distribution pattern and suggested increase in iron deposition of MS lesions have become targets to address this issue, particularly when susceptibility-weighted sequences are acquired on MR systems operating at high magnetic field strengths (\u22653.0T). Another strategy for this purpose is to include other important aspects of MS pathology in the evaluation, such as cortical abnormalities. However, imaging of cortical lesions at standard clinical field strength remains suboptimal even when combinations of sequences are used because of limitations in the associated sensitivity and reproducibility. Despite promising findings, imaging of perivenular distribution pattern, increase in iron deposition of focal lesions, and cortical lesions at standard clinical field strength remains challenging, and substantial research efforts are needed before these features can be used in the diagnostic imaging work-up in clinical practice.",

            "text": "Pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for approximately 5% of all MS patients. MRI characteristics of childhood MS does show similarities to adult-onset MS. However, pediatric MS patient show in general fewer lesions and these lesions do show less frequently blood barrier disruption leading to contrast-enhancement. In addition, children frequently present with clinical and imaging features of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis leading to MS during later follow-up stages. In particular, patients younger than 11 years may present with atypical and larger lesions compared to those lesions seen in adult patients. The 2010 revisions of the International Panel (McDonald) criteria clearly state that adult MS diagnostic criteria may be inappropriate for certain pediatric MS patients. Therefore, neurologists and (neuro)radiologist should be aware about the differences in imaging manifestations of pediatric MS patients in order to make the correct diagnosis and to consider appropriate differential diagnosis. The aim of this lecture is to provide a comprehensive overview of conventional and advanced imaging findings in pediatric MS patients with respect to lesion differentiation of important differential diagnosis and MS lesions in adult MS patients.",

            "text": "Classically multiple sclerosis (MS) has been regarded as an autoimmune disease of the white matter in the central nervous system leading to severe disability over the course of several decades. Current therapeutic strategies in MS are mostly based on either immune suppression or immune modulation. Although effective in decreasing relapse frequency and severity as well as delaying disease progression, MS pathology ensues nonetheless. In the last decade it became evident that gray matter pathology plays an important role in disease progression and helps explaining certain aspects of MS-related disability such as cognitive decline. Conventional MRI outcome measures commonly used in clinical trials are sufficient to demonstrate an anti-inflammatory drug-effect but lack pathological specificity and are poor to moderate predictors of disability. Brain atrophy is a compound outcome that measures the combined effects of gray matter and white matter pathology. In this lecture I will review the prognostic relevance of brain atrophy on a group level and discuss steps needed to implement this in clinical practice. Purpose: Patients with periodic paralysis experience episodic weakness spells with intervals of normal muscle function caused by altered muscle membrane potential due to changes in ion conductivities, such as nonselective cation leaks in hypokalemic periodic paralysis and Kir2.1 mutations of the myocellular potassium (K+) channel in Andersen-Tawil syndrome. The objective was to assess whether altered sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) homeostasis can be visualized in these periodic paralyses using ultrahigh field MRI. Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed consent of all participants were obtained. Nineteen 23-Na-MR (TR/TE=160/0.35) und seventeen 35-Cl-MR examinations (TR/TE=40/0.6) of both lower legs were performed on a 7-Tesla whole-body system in genetically confirmed hypokalemic periodic paralysis (Cav1.1-R1239H mutation, n=7; Cav1.1-R528H mutation, n=9) and Andersen-Tawil syndrome (n=4); median age, 47 years. Data from 16 healthy volunteers (median age, 27 years) were taken as reference. Additionally, each patient received 3-Tesla proton MR imaging on the same day using T1-weighted, short-tau inversion recovery and DIXON sequences. Muscle edema was assessed on STIR images, fatty degeneration on T1-weighted images and the muscular fat fraction was quantified using DIXON. Na+ and Cl-were quantified in the soleus muscle using three phantoms containing 10, 20, and 30 mM NaCl solution as reference.",

Purpose: To evaluate the functional connectivity of the visual network (VN), in patients with migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA), in the interictal period, in comparison to healthy controls (HC). Methods: Using resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI), the functional connectivity within VN in 20 patients with MwA was compared with 20 age-and sex-matched patients with MwoA and 20 healthy controls (HC).Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between functional connectivity within RS-VN and clinical features of patients with MwA. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess whether between-groups putative differences in functional connectivity were dependent on brain structural or microstructural differences. Finally, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) load of all migraine patients and HC was identified and evaluated in terms of volumetric features and signal. RS-fMRI data were analysed using the BrainVoyager QX software (voxel-level threshold p<0.05, FDR). VBM data were processed and examined using DARTEL with statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) software (p<0.05, FWE). DTI analysis was performed by using the Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library software package (p<0.05 cluster level corrected). WMH load was measured using the MIPAV software. Result: RS-fMR data showed that patients with MwA, compared to patients with MwoA and HC, had significant increased functional connectivity within VN and specifically in the right lingual gyrus (r-LG). Furthermore, we found that increased r-LG connectivity was not correlated with clinical parameters of disease severity. The abnormal VN functional connectivity was independent of structural or microstructural abnormalities as well as of WMH load. Conclusion: VN is a brain circuitry encompassing retinotopic occipital cortex and temporo-occipital regions, and representing the neural correlates of visual processing. Our findings are in line with previous electrophysiological and imaging findings suggesting a strict correlation between aura phenomenon and increased visual pathways functional connectivity in migraine. Our clinical and imaging data revealed a regional increased RS-VN functional connectivity, which is independent from structural or microstructural abnormalities, in patients with MwA. Purpose: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated condition characterised by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory deficits in all four limbs. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, neurophysiological and supportive criteria, but can often be challenging. Our aim was to explore the imaging characteristics of the sciatic nerves in patients with CIDP versus healthy controls using qualitative and quantitative MRI techniques. Methods: MRI of both thighs was performed at 3T in 10 patients with CIDP (7M/3F, age 52 \u00b1 15y) and 9 healthy controls (6M/3F, age 50 \u00b1 11y), using dual echo T2 mapping, 3D proton density (PD)-weighted, and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences. T2 was measured along the length of each sciatic nerve by defining enclosing regions of interest on the T2w sequence, with the same method used to measure crosssectional area at the mid-thigh level on the PDw sequence. The nerve appearance was also evaluated qualitatively on the STIR images, and rated as isointense (0), midly hyperintense (1), or markedly hyperintense (2) compared to surrounding tissue. All measurements were performed by an observer blinded to the diagnosis. Result: Cross sectional area of the sciatic nerves was increased in patients with CIDP compared to controls (p<0.01). Median areas were 430mm2 (interquartile range 135mm2) for the CIDP group and 285mm2 (IQR 110mm2) for the control group. Median T2s were also increased in the CIDP group (60.25ms; IQR 9.9ms) compared to controls ( Purpose: We present our preliminary results achieved with the first Italian installation of a trans-cranial MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (tcMRgFUS) certified system for functional neurosurgery.

In DSC-MRI, signal loss due to T2* effect of intravascular contrast material (CM) is contaminated by a signal gain due to T1 shortening by CM in interstitial space. Otherwise, T1 signal in DCE-MRI is partly influenced by T2* changes.

A 10 echo FLASH sequence with a temporal resolution of 2 sec was performed after single bolus injection of gadodiamide (0.2 ml/kg body weight). Mono-exponential function was fitted to the signals of the 10 echoes in order to calculate R2* and to separate it from the T1 only dependent signal S0. Perfusion parameters were calculated with Tofts and Patlak models using different estimates for arterial input function and compared for different tumor entities. Additionally, correlation analysis of perfusion parameters in glioblastoma patients with and without Methylguanin-DNS-Methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation (7 and 14 patients, respectively) was done. Result: Best reproducibility was observed for Ktrans (Tofts) derived from S0 and for cerebral blood volume (CBV), both based on AIFs derived from venous R2* time course. Meningioma showed highest values of Ktrans and CBV followed by glioblastoma. Perfusion parameters of metastases varied widely, probably due to different kinds of primary tumors. Significant differences were also found between Ktrans and CBV in glioblastoma with and without MGMT promoter methylation. Conclusion: Dynamic-multi-echo perfusion MRI combining T1 und T2* measurements after a single contrast injection allowed stable and plausible evaluation of Ktrans and CBV in different intracranial tumors. In addition, our preliminary data suggest significant differences in perfusion patterns of glioblastoma dependent on their MGMT promoter status. Purpose: Among patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), psychiatric symptoms are frequent. One hypothesis is that this is caused by impaired insular function (Sliz, Front Hum Neurosc, 2012). We studied whether regional perfusion in the insular cortex is lower in FTD than controls, taking grey matter (GM) atrophy into account. Methods: Thirty-seven FTD patients and 34 controls underwent 3T MRI, including 3D high-resolution (1mm3) T1w and 3D pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling. GM volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF in ml/ min/100g), corrected for partial volume effects, were quantified for whole supratentorial brain and insular cortex, left and right separately.

Our further research focuses at assessing whether such insular hypoperfusion relates to the burden of psychiatric symptoms in these patients, results which we aim to also present at the meeting. Purpose: The present study shows the results of a double-blind shamcontrolled pilot trial to test whether measurable stimulus-specific RSFC changes exist after plantar mechanical stimulation in patients with idiopathic Parkinson Disease. Methods: Eleven patients (6 women and 5 men) with idiopathic Parkinson Disease underwent brain fMRI immediately before and after sham or effective plantar mechanical stimulation. Resting state Functional Connectivity (RSFC) was assessed using the seed-ROI based analysis. Seed ROIs were positioned on basal ganglia, on primary sensory-motor cortices, on the supplementary motor areas and on the cerebellum. Individual differences for pre-and post-effective plantar mechanical stimulation and pre-and post-sham condition were obtained and first entered in respective one-sample t-test analyses, to evaluate the mean effect of condition. Result: Effective plantar mechanical stimulation, but not sham stimulation, induced increase of RSFC of the sensory motor cortex, supplementary motor area, nucleus striatum and cerebellum. Secondly, individual differences for both conditions were entered into paired group t-test analysis to rule out sub-threshold effects of sham plantar mechanical stimulation, which showed stronger connectivity of the primary sensory-motor cortex with the post-and pre-central gyrus (max Z score 3.50) and of the cerebellum with the left lateral occipital cortex, precuneus and left cerebellar paravermal cortex (max Z score 3.64). Conclusion: Our results suggest that effective plantar mechanical stimulation acutely increases RSFC of brain regions involved in visuo-spatial and sensory-motor integration. Clinical Trials. Purpose: Cortico-basal syndrome (CBS) is an atypical parkinsonism characterized with cortical and basal ganglia neurodegeneration. Our aim was to evaluate possible specific changes in cortical thickness (CTh) and anatomically constrained tractography in CBS patients compared to healthy subjects (HS). Methods: We recruited 11 CBS patients and 11 age-and gender-matched HS. Motor signs were scored with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Patients were divided in two groups on the basis of clinical asymmetry: left (l-CBS) and right (r-CBS). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D-T1 images were acquired with a 3T MRI scanner. Data analysis was performed using Freesurfer software. 3D-T1 images were segmented on the basis of Desikan/Killinay atlas to obtain 34 cortical regions to calculate the CTh. Volumes of seven subcortical structures (thalamus, caudate, accumbence, pallidum, putamen, hippocampus and amygdala) in each hemisphere, brainstem and corpus callosum were also extracted.",

Result: Patients had significant CTh reduction in the precentral and superior temporal gyri, bilaterally. Analysing l-CBS and r-CBS separately, the CTh was found decreased preferentially in the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the clinically more affected body side. Patients also showed significant volume loss in the putamen, hippocampus, accumbence bilaterally, in the corpus callosum and right amygdala. In patients, DTI values were altered in all WM tracts, without significant asymmetries. The CTh reduction in the rolandic area significantly negatively correlated with both the contralateral limb UPDRS scores and disease duration. Conclusion: Our results show a circumscribed and asymmetric cortical thinning, which correlates with clinical severity and disease duration in patients with CBS, and likely represents the anatomical substrate of clinical impairment in the disease.

Embryology and classification: Spinal cord development occurs through three consecutive periods: (i) gastrulation (2nd gestational week): the embryonic disk is converted from a bilaminar into a trilaminar arrangement, with formation of the intervening mesoderm; the notochord is laid down along the midline, identifying the craniocaudal embryonic axis; (ii) primary neurulation (18th-27th day): under the induction of the notochord, the midline ectoderm specializes into neural ectoderm. The initially flat neural plate progressively bends and folds until it fuses in the midline to form the neural tube. The primary neural tube produces the uppermost 9/10 of spinal cord; (iii) secondary neurulation (28th-48th day): a secondary neural tube is laid down caudad to the termination of the primary neural tube. Retrogressive differentiation of the secondary neural tube results in the tip of the conus medullaris and filum terminale. Defects in one of these three embryological steps produce spinal dysraphisms, characterized by anomalous differentiation and fusion of dorsal midline structures. Spinal dysraphisms may be categorized clinically in two subsets: open and closed spinal dysraphisms.",

OSD include myelomeningocele, myelocele, hemimyelomeningocele and hemimyelocele, and are associated with a Chiari II malformation. Myelomeningocele is by far the most common of these forms; the placode protrudes through a posterior defect and is elevated above the skin surface due to concurrent dilatation of the subarachnoid spaces. Closed spinal dysraphisms: Closed spinal dysraphisms (CSD) are covered by intact skin, although cutaneous stigmata usually indicate their presence. Two subsets may be identified based on whether a subcutaneous mass is present. CSD with tumefaction comprise lipomas with dural defect (lipomyelocele and lipomyelomeningocele), meningocele, and myelocystocele. Lipomas with dural defect are more common; they are differentiated from one another based on the position of the cord-lipoma interface, that lies within the spinal canal in lipomyelocele, and outside the spinal canal (ie, into a meningocele) in lipomyelomeningocele. CSD without tumefaction comprise complex dysraphic states (ranging from complete dorsal enteric fistula to neurenteric cysts, diastematomyelia, dermal sinuses, caudal agenesis, and spinal segmental dysgenesis), bony spina bifida, tight filum terminale, filar and intradural lipomas, and persisting terminal ventricle. The most complicated forms (complex dysraphic states), including diastematomyelia, caudal regression, and segmental spinal dysgenesis) are related to faulty gastrulation. Diastematomyelia (literally, split cord) is caused by failure of midline notochordal integration, resulting into two separate hemineural plates. Caudal agenesis and segmental spinal dysgenesis are related to defective notochordal formation, characterized by absence or hypoplasia of a segment of the notochord, in turn resulting into absence or hypoplasia of a corresponding segment of the spinal cord.",

Successful treatment of such aneurysms is hampered by high surgical morbidity and low efficacy of coil embolization due to a high rate of incomplete occlusion and recurrence. Parent artery occlusion is effective and remains the gold standard, but is restricted to aneurysms with sufficient collateral circulation. Flow modification techniques and newer neck remodeling methods have been recently introduced to overcome these difficulties. For side wall aneurysms, flow diversion (FD) using high mesh density woven FD devices has been proved highly effective in permanently eliminating mass effect. Due to the relative high incidence of delayed rupture (4.5%), additional coil packing is recommended for very large and giant aneurysms. For bifurcation aneurysms, FD is restricted to highly asymmetrical configurations. In true bifurcation aneurysms, stent assisted coil embolization, Y stent reconstruction and other neck remodeling techniques (\"waffle cone\", \"barrel\" stent, intra-arterial neck protection device) can be used in combination with intrasaccular coil packing. Stent assisted embolization provides some improvement of the long term results, but recurrence remains a common problem. The newer neck protection techniques make endovascular treatment feasible in most cases, however, their long term effect is not yet proved. Parent artery occlusion with or without bypass surgery still needs to be considered as a potential option for such aneurysms.",

Although conventional bypassing using temporal clipping of the recipient vessel can be a succesfull treatment of more distally located aneurysms, for bypassing arteries with larger territories this conventional technique bears increasing risks due to its occlusive character. To circumvent this hazard the Excimer Laser Assisted Non-occlusive Anastomosis technique (ELANA) has been developed in our department. ELANA enables the neurosurgeon to construct an end-to-side anastomosis without temporal occluding the recipient artery and thus safely creating high-flow replacement EC-IC or IC-IC bypasses on proximal cerebral arteries in the treatment of giant ICA aneurysms. Pre-and intraoperative flowmeasurements are mandatory in planning and performing this type of surgery. Until present ELANA has been performed on >450 patients and is now available in 6 centers in Europe and in 5 centers in the US and Canada. The innovative ELANA bypass technique prooves to be an efficient and save treatment modality in the the cohort of difficult to treat patients with giant aneurysms and is a powerfull tool also in combination with conventional bypass techniques.",

The goal and type of treatment have to be adapted to the venous drainage type and consequent treatment neurological risk.

Those symptoms are generally related to either blood flow through AV shunts ( such as tinnitus) or venous ischemia of neural tissue due to venous hypertension. In most of the cases Endovascular treatment is the treatment of choice because of effectiveness and safety. Certain precautions are needed for a safer and more effective treatment. The most important step in treatment planning is the analysis of the malformation. The feeders, the fistulae site and the venous drainage should be thoroughly scrutinized. Venous drainage is probably the most important elements since most of the major sometimes-fatal complications are related to the venous site. Draining venous structures either pial veins or dural sinuses are to be separated as dedicated (draining fistula only) or shared (draining normal tissue as well). All shared venous structures need to be spared while dedicated ones can be safely occluded. Once venous site is decided the either trans arterial or trans venous routes can easily be chosen and the embolic agent ( coils, liquids etc) will also be decided accordingly. While performing trans arterial liquid embolization so called dangerous anastomosis should be kept in mind in order to prevent inadvertent occlusion of normal branches feeding either neural tissue or cranial nerves.",

Interventional neuroradiology is luckily has access to this evolution especially in endovascular treatment techniques of neurovascular disorders. As it appears in all new surgical techniques, to get scientific proof and high level of evidence need some times and big effort. Accumulation of knowledge and having negative or positive or neutral data shapes societies to select certain treatment options for their cases. In the lecture ,RCT effects on endovascular treatment strategies will be discussed. Purpose: Purpose:Trial outcome measures in neuromuscular diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) currently rely on invasive or functional but insensitive tests. Muscle MRI could offer a valuable alternative. Reliable evaluation of the upper limb could permit inclusion of non-ambulant DMD individuals not able to perform functional tests such as the 6-minute walk test. We aimed to compare longitudinal MRI-quantification of fatinfiltration in the forearm muscles of non-ambulant DMD patients and healthy controls. Methods: Methods: 16 DMD boys and 10 age gender and age matched controls were included in this on-going study. Fat-water quantification was used to compare fat-infiltration in the forearm muscles of non-ambulant DMD patients and healthy controls. DMD individuals underwent 3T 3-point Dixon imaging of the dominant forearm to measure muscle fat-fraction (f.f.). Ten forearm muscles were segmented and mean f.f. and cross-sectional area recorded. Patients also underwent physiotherapy evaluation: Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) module; wrist extension myometry; and EK2 performance of tasks in daily life interview. Time to loss of ambulation (LOA) was recorded. Result: Results: To date, 7 non-ambulant DMD patients (mean age: 13.6 years; mean duration of non-ambulation 23.6 months) have been examined at baseline and 6 months, and 5 have returned for 1yr follow-up. 10 controls (mean age: 14.6 years) have also been imaged. At baseline overall mean f.f (\u00b1SD) in DMD was significantly higher than healthy controls: (13.4\u00b111%vs 0.7\u00b10.1%, p=0.002). Total mean area was reduced in DMD (1735\u00b1331mm2) compared to healthy controls (2398\u00b1821mm2, p=0.04). Overall f.f. correlated with LOA (Spearman r=0.8, p=0.02) and wrist extension myometry (r=0.8, p=0.004) and less strongly with PUL (r=-0.6, p=0.09) and with EK2 (r= 0.6, p=0.09). In patients mean f.f. difference at 6 months was 4% (95%CI 0.9, 7.1); p=0.01. Mean difference from baseline in the 5 patient-subject analysed at 12 months was 5.5% (95%CI 0.8, 11.5). Our final analysis will include additional distal and proximal imaging slices. Purpose: Recent post-mortem studies showed millimetric focal anomalies distributed throughout the cerebral cortex in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, classic parametric voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was not able to detect diffuse focal cortical alterations in ASD. The present study aims to detect structural anomalies in the under-researched condition of LFASD by threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) voxel-wise investigation. Methods: Twenty-five idiopathic LFASD (22M-3F, 6.11\u00b13.10ys), 25 typically developing (TD, 12M-13F, 6.11\u00b12.6ys), and 25 nonsyndromic intellectually disable (ID) children (16M-9F, 7.0\u00b13.1ys) were enrolled. DARTEL normalization to a study-specific template, segmentation, non-linear only modulation and several smoothing kernels were applied. 2mm/4mm/8mm smoothed images were used in the classic parametric VBM and 0mm/2mm/ 4mm smoothed images were used in the TFCE-based non parametric VBM. Local gray matter (GM)/white matter (WM) volume differences were investigated using one-way ANOVAs (nuisance covariates: age, gender, IQ, total GM/WM volume) designed in SPM8.",

TFCE tests were sensitive to local GM and local WM volume differences (p<0.05 FWE corr). The larger smoothing kernel was applied, the more diffuse the differences were. Local GM volume was significantly different between LFASD and both TD and ID in a fronto-cingulate-parietal pattern. In addition, body and genu of corpus callosum showed decreased local WM volume in LFASD and basal ganglia alterations were found in both LFASD and ID. Conclusion: Unlike classic parametric inference, non parametric inference allowed to highlight diffuse focal cortical alterations in LFASD. For the first time, diffuse focal cortical alterations are shown in LFASD by MRI-based investigation. Structural anomalies in fronto-cingulate-parietal regions might be specific to ASD. Alterations might indeed reflect the patches of disorganization in the neocortex, subtle focal cortical dysplasias most abundant within the prefrontal lobes described and associated to focal and distributed thinning of the cortex by post-mortem investigations. Thus, voxelwise MRI-based investigations may be sensitive to such structural anomalies and the focal nature of the expected cortical anomalies ought to be taken into account in further MRI-based investigations in ASD.",

            "text": "Autism spectrum disorder,cortical abnormalities,voxel-based morphometry Purpose: progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and cognitive deficits. Previous structural imaging studies have revealed supra-and infratentorial white matter (WM) changes]. However, conflicting clinical radiological correlations have been reported. The aim of the present study was to explore WM changes in patients with PSP and their potential associations with clinical and cognitive parameters Methods: By using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and tract based spatial statistic (TBSS) analysis we compared WM volume in 18 patients with clinically probable diagnosis of PSP and 18 healthy controls (Hcs). Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were generated. All patients and Hcs underwent a clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. TBSS analysis was performed by using the functional MRI of the brain (FMRIB) software library (FSL) software package. In the between group analysis we compared the FA, MD, AD, and RD maps of all patients with PSP with HCs. Wholebrain correlations were calculated, using general linear model tool of FSL package, to evaluate the relationship between DTI parameters (FA, AD, RD, and MD) and clinical and cognitive scores. Statistical threshold was set at p < 0.05. Group differences were assessed with age, sex, and years of education as covariates. All analyses were re-run with the inclusion of WM hyperintensity volume as an additional covariate. Result: Patients with PSP compared with HCs, showed an abnormal diffusivity involving corpus callosum, right fornix, midbrain, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior cerebellar peduncle, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulate gyrus and cortico-spinal tract bilaterally. Among the significant clinical-radiological correlations and in line with our previous voxel-based morphometry findings, we detected an association between motor and cognitive dysfunction with fronto-cerebellar WM involvement. Conclusion: Our results confirmed the well-known role of cerebellar pathology in the pathogenesis of motor impairment in patients with PSP and may suggest that beyond an \"intrinsic\" frontal cortical involvement, an \"extrinsic\" frontal lobe dysfunction may underlie cognitive deficits in this devasting disorder. Purpose: Potential neuroanatomical changes resulting from blindness have remained largely unexplored. Recently, an involvement of amygdala, a subcortical structure not primarily engaged in visual processing, has been suggested by multisensorial functional imaging in congenital blindness. Aim of this study is to evaluate volumetric changes and white matter connections of amygdalae by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, relating different findings to clinical and behavioural tests. Methods: We acquired high-resolution T1-weighted and DTI MRI scans in 12 congenitally blind (mean age 42 \u00b1 13 years) and 15 sighted control (mean age 46 \u00b1 13 years) subjects. FreeSurfer was used to segment the amygdala bilaterally, and volumes were extracted for group and gender comparisons. Following, amygdala connections with whole brain were analyzed in both the groups, using FreeSurfer segmented volumes as seeds for probabilistic tractography. Finally, findings were correlated to age of disease and Braille reading performances (words per minute) for the congenital blind subjects. Result: A significant reduction of amygdala volumes has been detected in congenital blind subjects, compared to sighted controls. This atrophy is correlated to age of disease but not to the age of control subjects or Braille performances. Four tracts have been detected using as seed the parcellated volume of amygdalae extracted by FreeSurfer: the uncinate fascicle, the anterior commissure, the fornix crux and the inferior longitudinal fascicle. A selective alteration of inferior longitudinal fascicle, in terms of reduced fractional anisotropy, increased radial diffusivity, and reduced tract volume has been detected for congenital blind subjects, compared to controls. No significant alterations resulted for the remaining white matter tracts. Conclusion: Congenital blindness determines a volumetric reduction of amygdala that is related to an alteration of Inferior Longitudinal Fascicle integrity, probably due to visual deafferentation, with a preservation of other amygdala fascicles. These changes are correlated to age of disease but not Braille reading performances, and contribute to brain neuroplasticity of congenital blind subjects. Purpose: Diagnostic decision-making process in disorders of consciousness is extremely subjective. Diagnostic methods offer minimal resources for objective functional research. Resting function magnetic resonance imaging (rFMRI) allows to estimate the neural networks activation, connectivity and its interactions in the brain with the present or absent evidence of consciousness. According to the literature, patients with severe brain damage, who survived coma, by increasing the consciousness level, show selective activation of the default mode network (DMN). The aim of our study was to evaluate the parameters of the DMN activation in clinical cases of patients with chronic disorders of consciousnessunresponsive wakefullness syndrome (vegetative state -VS) and minimal consciousness state (MCS). Methods: We included 4 patients with disorders of consciousness with various etiology -1 person with anoxic brain injury,1 with severe traumatic brain injury both after one year period, 1 with hemorrhagic stroke with 3 months after injury and 1 with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 3 months after onset. Control group included 3 healthy volunteers. Level of consciousness was assessed with the well-established standardized Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CSR-R) behavioral test and on admission the results showed 4,12,18 and 18 points, which complies with VS in the first case and MCS in three left. Result: DMN activity was not detected in the 'unresponsible wakefullness syndrome' case. Though, in MCS, we found a significant activity increasing in DMN structures. Statistically significant index of functional connectivity between the right and left parahippocampal gyri in patients with MCS was 3.46 (N=20.13); between the left front cingulate gyrus and sulcus intraparietal was -6.28 (normal data functional connectivity in structures is absent The vetting, protocolling and prioritisation of imaging requests forms a fundamental part of the Neuroradiologist's role, yet is rarely formally taught nor assessed. The purpose of this project is to develop a radiology-specific WPB assessment (VetPro) which focuses training on this vital but neglected area, and to test its feasibility and educational validity. Methods: Based on a systematic literature review and curriculum competencies, key domains were identified and refined using a Delphi study; an iterative consensus technique with controlled feedback from an expert group. Result: Radiologists from 5 teaching institutions were contacted, and following a 36% response rate (44 consultants), a 3-round Delphi study was undertaken. Each facet was rated on a 1-5 Likert scale. This led to the refinement of a prototype assessment tool consisting of the 14 highestranked domains (Vetting -radiology protection, clinical interpretation/ Protocolling -understanding of image modalities and sequences, communication/ Prioritisationjudgement, insight and decisionmaking) as well as a global ranking score. The format was derived from validated WPBAs, including the mini-CEX, utilising a 6-point ordinal scale, each anchor relating to the degree of competency expected for the stage of training, and one global summary score using a 4 point scale, with anchors linked to readiness for independent practice. 10 assessors comprising 7 neuroradiologists and 3 radiographers from 4 neuroradiology centres are concluding assessments on a cohort of 30 trainees, specifically addressing statistical differences in global rating scale between trainees with differing levels of training and experience. Reliability coefficients will dictate the number of assessors and assessments needed to reach acceptable levels of reliability for summative assessments. Conclusion: To prepare trainees for their future consultant role, the development of the VetPro WPBA provides a radiology-specific assessment tool which targets the often overlooked competencies necessary for imaging request vetting, protocolling and prioritisation. This novel assessment, which is being integrated into clinical practice, emphasises relevant and focused feedback which improves engagement in the educational process.

Diagnostic imaging studies are generally of lower evidence base medicine levels (3 or 4). The structure of most RCT includes: the participants, allocations, intervention, and measurements of outcomes as per statistical analysis. Randomization and thus group allocation is their most important component and need to be completely free of bias. For purpose of this lecture we will analyze 3 RCTs: a clinical one (the use of antibiotics in sinusitis) and two imaging ones (MR. CLEAN and the original ISAT studies). The last one will serve as an example as to the utility of interim data analysis and early termination of a study.",

The knwoledge of the criteria of the reviewer will use to judge the paper, to positioning it in a much better position to tailor the paper so that it has a higher chance of being accepted. Peer review helps validate research, establish a method by which it can be evaluated, and increase networking possibilities within research communities. Despite criticisms, peer review is still the only widely accepted method for research validation.Three type of peer review will describe. Single Blind Review The names of the reviewers are hidden from the author. This is the traditional method of reviewing and is the most common type by far. Reviewer anonymity allows for impartial decisions ; the reviewers will not be influenced by the authors. Double Blind Review: both the reviewer and the author are anonymous. Author anonymity prevents any reviewer bias, for example based on an author's country of origin or previous controversial work. Open Review: Reviewer and author are known to each other. Reviewing is both a privilege and responsibility. It takes time to prepare a useful, critical review. Moreover, it clearly is a service to the journal, to the authors, to science at large, and to the reviewer because the reviewer becomes privy to the latest in cutting-edge research. Purpose: Low grade gemistocytic astrocytoma (GemA) has shown characteristic features which are different from other low grade astrocytoma and mimicking high grade glioma. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiologic findings of low grade GemA and to compare these findings with those of low grade non-GemA. Methods: MR imagings were obtained in 18 patients with pathologically confirmed as low grade GemA between January 2005 and December 2014 and 18 patients with pathologically confirmed as low grade non-GemA between January 2009 and December 2011 in single institution.

To further substantiate these findings a sample size of 45 subjects would be required for a significance level of 5% with 90% power. Conclusion: For preoperative LGG segmentation, DIR provides the highest observer confidence whilst the resulting volumetric assessment is comparable to the FLAIR rather than the T2w-TSE conventional sequence. To detect a statistically significant difference between DIR and FLAIR the sample size will need to be increased to at least 45 subjects. In addition to a faster segmentation, the increased DIR contrast could facilitate automated methods enabling routine volumetric tumour measurements, which may increase diagnostic accuracy when monitoring disease progression. Result: Human GBM cells formed intracerebral masses 5~7 days after stereotactic implantation in all animals ( Figure 1 ). Dynamic enhancement patterns after contrast media injection were different according to the property of contrast media (Figure 2 ). At the DCE curves of the brain tumor model, the signal enhancement for ionic agents was prolonged over 80 minutes while that for nonionic agents was less than 30 minutes. Conclusion: Ionic MR contrast agents remained longer than nonionic agents in the rodent brain tumor. Thus nonionic agents may be a better MR contrast agent for brain tumor perfusion MRI than ionic agents.

One rater did repetitive segmentations of the initial MRI to address intra-rater-reliability. All patients underwent high-resolution MR imaging including a 3D fluid-attenuated-inversionrecovery (FLAIR) sequence and a 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRage) sequence without and with contrast agent. Tumor segmentation was done using a semi-automated segmentation tool based on a region-growing-algorithm with 3D-interpolation. Tumor volume was compared between the different groups of raters by calculating the intra-class-correlation (ICC) for the inter-and intra-raterreliability and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) to determine the precision error as well as the least significant change (LSC).",

Images were nonlinearly co-registered to T1-weighted pretreatment scans. Diffusion changes were quantified and presented as a functional diffusion map (fDM).

All data analysis was performed using a statistical package (IBM SPSS statistics version 20, Somers, NY, USA) Result: Out of the 38 metastases analyzed, 18 were classified as partial response (PR), 10 as stable disease (SD) and 10 as progressive disease (PD). Normalized volume values of the metastases for each response group were obtained, disclosing that apparent diffusion coefficient increase was a good predictor of response (PR). So, sensitivity was 88%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value was 94%. After 3 months after initiation of therapy, the percentage of tumor volume with significant ADC increase was the strongest predictor of treatment response than the changes in whole-tumor volume and mean ADC values determined at the same time point as compared to their pretherapy values. year-old age were excluded.

The MR images were analyzed for identification of DDR, surrounding regional anatomical structures, and paraclinoid aneurysm. The locations of the aneurysms were categorized into intradural or extradural. The imaging findings were compared with the angiographic or surgical findings. Result: All 25 aneurysms were identified by high-resolution 3D-PD ATSE MR imaging, which showed the accurate locations in regards to DDR and other adjacent anatomical landmarks. The aneurysm locations were 14 intradural and 11 extradural. A comparison between high-resolution MR imaging and conventional angiography revealed discordant anatomic locations in 7 aneurysms ( 7 of 23, 30% Purpose: Ruptured blood-blister-like (BBL) aneurysms represent a therapeutic challenge. Timing of treatment and technique of choice are still a subject of debate. We report our experience in the endovascular treatment of such lesions in the subacute phase. Methods: Between june 2011 and January 2015, 6 ruptured BBL aneurysms were treated at our institution. Four were located in the carotid siphon, 2 in the posterior circulation. Endovascular procedures were carried out between day 7 and day 15 after the hemorragic event. One patient was treated surgically. Flow-diverter stents (FDS) were used in 4 cases. Two telescopic laser-cut stents were used in one case. Double antiplatelet therapy was started 4 days before treatment in 1 case and the day of the procedure in the remaining 4 cases. Angiographic follow-up was carried out by MRA and DSA at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Result: All endovascular procedures were performed without technical difficulties. Antiplatelet treatment was started 4 days prior to procedure in one case and the day of the intervention in the other cases. One patient presented a transient motor deficit at day 1 after treatment. One patient had a peroperative cerebellar ischemia after FDS deployement, despite antiplatelet treatment. One patient treatd by surgery had a fatal brain ischemia after peroperative aneurysmal rupture that eventually required clipping of the carotid siphon. Imaging follow was available for the remaining 5 patients. No patent rebled prior to treatment or during followup. Three out of five aneurysms were completely occluded at latest follow-up. Conclusion: Modern endovascular techniques for the treatment of ruptures BBL aneurysms, including the use of flow-diversion, seem promising. Treatment in the subacute phase may be considered as an option in relation to other clinical issues (patient WFNS grade, risk of rebleeding under antiplatelet therapy, ventricular shunting) when pondering overall risks and benefits in patient management. Keywords Blood-blister-like aneurysms,flow diversion,subacute phase Purpose: Endovascular treatment of wide neck brain aneurysms can be very challenging, particularly wide-neck bifurcation intracranial aneurysms are still very difficult to manage and represent an obstacle to safe and effective endovascular treatment that has not yet been solved. WEB is an intrasaccular flow disruption device, placed within the aneurysm pouch, creates blood flow stasis with subsequent thrombosis. Because the flow disruptor device is placed wholly within the aneurysm, the need for antiplatelet therapy is eliminated an then this intrasaccular treatment is potentially valuable in ruptured aneurysms. WEB treatment of recanalized aneurysms also seems feasible. The first double layer version of the WEB devices presented some troubles in its feasibility with a not negligible rate of recurrence. We report our experience with both versions, double and single layer, of the WEB device. Methods: Since June 2012, 10 patients with 10 brain unruptured aneurysms, were treated at our institution using WEB devices. The former 2/10 aneurysms were treated using the double layer initial version of the WEB device. The latter 8/10 ones were treated with the new single-layer version. All treated aneurysms were unruptured. Five out of 10 aneurysms were located at MCA bifurcation (5 small), 1/10 at Acomm bifurcation (small), 3/10 at intracranial carotid bifurcation (2 medium, 1 small), 1/10 basilar tip (small). Follow-up was performed by MRI at one month in 10/10 aneurysms, while just 2/10 have reached one year followup performed by both MRI and DSA. Result: All treatments were performed without any procedural and post-procedural complication. Follow-up showed recurrence in 1/10 aneurysm (10%). This case, successfully retreated with p-Conus device, will be discussed. It referred to the first case in our experience and, as previously mentioned, it was performed with a double layer WEB device. Conclusion: According to our preliminary experience, despite some troubles during first treatment, WEB endosaccular device revealed safe and feasible. Feasibility improved using single layer device that looked softer and more reliable than the stiffer double layer one. To obtain optimal results, the importance of initial measurements has to be stressed.

Although CT can show the bone alterations, MR is the method of choice as the signal intensities provided by the different sequences help to characterize the lesions. The most frequent tumoral lesions are of course acoustic schwannomas, paragangliomas, meningiomas and epidermoid tumors. These are well known and will only be briefly discussed, especially how to differentiate them from one another in difficult cases or how to recognize potential atypical behavior. Less frequent lesions like lower cranial nerve or facial nerve schwannomas, lipomas, hemangiomas, metastases and lymphomas in the CPA and IAC are less frequent and pose more difficulties. Middle ear lesions are less know and apart from facial nerve schwannomas and paragangliomas one can also find hemangiomas, meningiomas and adenomas as well as malignant tumors with extension to the middle ear, including head and neck malignancies with extension to the m i d d l e e a r a n d Chondrosarcomas, giant cell tumors, histiocytosis, Ewing sarcoma, endolymphatic sac tumors etc. can be found in the region of the petrous apex/mastoid and must be distinguished from benign lesions like cholesterol granuloma. The characteristics of the most frequent occurring lesions in the CPA, IAC, middle ear, petrous apex and EAC will be discussed and illustrated in this lecture.",

There is a certain overlap, sometimes resulting in confusion, between the anatomic and surgical borders and definitions of the neck spaces. It is necessary for the clinical radiologist to elucidate the complex anatomical relationships from a radiological point of view and to present the critical contents of each space. Thus, a space-orientated differential diagnosis may be facilitated and according to the location and the typical imaging appearance of various lesions the differential diagnosis may be narrowed down to specific pathologies. Common pathologies in the vicinity of the critical contents as well as pathologies extending beyond one anatomical space are also of major interest for the radiologist and crucial for the patient's treatment. Therefore, imaging surveys should be meticulously read for such imaging findings.",

Basic concepts of sinonasal CT and CBCT are reviewed including protocols, radiation doses, 2D and 3D reconstructions and the administration of contrast material. A brief discussion of the pertinent anatomy including the most relevant radiological anatomical landmarks will follow. The added value of MRI in specific situations is equally discussed. The low back pain (LBP) is the second most frequent cause of medical consultation in all western countries. LBP is more often idiopathic and have as most frequent the internal disc disruption (IDD) and it is referred to as discogenic pain. IDD consists in anular fissures, disc collapse and mechanical impairment eventually associated to endplates failure and is considered as a separate pathogical entity in respect to other painful conditions such as degenerative disc disease, disc herniation and segmental instability. Discogenic pain has either a mechanical and an inflammatory genesis. The radicular pain is most often generated by a disc herniation or a spinal canal stenosis. Facet pain may be due to degenerative changes and osteoarthritis. Because of the rich innervation facet joints can be a direct source of pain or can cause compression of nerve roots in lateral recesses and in the neural foramina. Disc and facet joints degeneration can cause segmental instability being another common cause of axial and radicular pain and chronic disability. The complex anatomy innervations and function of the spine render challenging the clinical assessment of pain pain with advanced imaging being often not confirmatory because similar changes are found in either asymptomatic and ill subjects. Clinical correlation is always mandatory and therapy cannot rely solely upon imaging abnormalities. The knowledge of pathophysiology of discogenic, radicular, facet and dysfunctional pain and the role of imaging in each one of these pathologies is the fundament for a correct approach to spinal patients.",

Neuroimaging studies in insomnia support the global hyperarousal hypothesis, by showing decreased inhibition during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. In addition, neuroimaging findings in insomnia also demonstrated alterations located in prefrontal and parietal cortices, possibly in relationship with cognitive deficits, and showing partial recovery following cognitive behavioral therapy. In narcoleptic patients, both functional and structural abnormalities were found in the hypothalamus, supporting a hypocretinergic dysfunction, whereas altered limbic responses may relate to emotional dysregulation contributing to the onset of cataplectic episodes. Neuroimaging studies of obstructive sleep apnea have shown alterations in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and parietal cortex in relationship with neuropsychological deficits. Some of these changes were reversible by treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.

            "text": "Sacral insufficiency fractures were originally described, by Lourie in 1982. Sacral insufficiency fractures primarily occur in older females, and as our population continues to age, we expect to see a rise in the incidence. Sacroplasty assists in sacral stabilization. CT, whether utilized alone or in combination with fluoroscopy, dramatically improves visualization of the sacrum and the critical neural bearing structures within its substance during the sacroplasty procedure. Sacroplasty is an established effective procedure for the treatment of painful osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fractures. Sacroplasty can also be utilized in the management and treatment of painful sacral neoplastic lesions. The aim of this work was to evaluate thalamo-cortical FC changes in patients with secondary progressive (SP) MS, as compared to both RR and healthy subjects (HS), and to investigate correlations with cognitive impairment. Methods: Fourthy MS patients (20 RR and 20 SP) and 20 HS underwent a 3 Tesla fMRI at rest; they were also scored with PASAT. Data were analysed with tools from FMRIB Software Library; the seed-based method was used to identify the thalamic RS network (RSN). Result: Thalamic RSN was altered in both SP and RR with respect to HS, with greatest FC abnormalities in SP. In particular, thalamo-cortical FC was lower in RR than in HS in left temporo-occipital, frontal and parietal cortices, bilaterally and in the cerebellum; SP showed decreased FC in the same brain areas, which were even more extensively affected, and, in addition, in the medial thalami. Thalamo-cortical FC was higher in RR than in HS in the right frontal and in the occipital and cingulate cortices, bilaterally; SP showed increased FC also in the right temporo-occipital cortex, hippocampi and posterior thalami, in addition to the aforementioned areas. PASAT scores were significantly lower in patients than HS and in SP than in RR. In RR, PASAT scores significantly correlated with thalamo-cortical FC in the frontal cortex bilaterally, thalami and left anterior insula, indicating that worse the performance greater the FC. In SP widespread hyperconnectivity, including the cerebellum, thalami, posterior cingulate, anterior insula and multiple foci in the whole cerebral cortex, inversely correlated with PASAT scores. Conclusion: Our data indicate that thalamic RSN is progressively altered in the two MS subtypes: SP showed more extensive patterns of both decreased and increased FC than RR. Moreover, the correlation between cognitive impairment and increased thalamo-cortical FC suggests that the recruitment of additional areas within the thalamic RSN is unable to prevent the cognitive decline. Purpose: Although the relationship between cerebellar function and balance capability is well known, only few study explored cerebellar functional connectivity abnormalities underlying clinical impairment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and no one was focused on postural deficits. The aim of our work was to investigate, by using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), the alterations of functional connections between the cerebellum and other brain structures in MS patients and their role in balance regulation. Methods: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS and 25 healty subjects underwent a 3 Tesla rs-fMRI and a static posturography to calculate the body's center of pressure displacement (COP path). Functional MR imaging data were analyzed with tools from FMRIB Software Library, by using the seed-based method to identify the cerebellar RS network (RSN); both dentate nuclei were used as seed region. Result: As compared to HS, patients had worse postural stability. FMRI analysis revealed an altered connectivity within the cerebellar RSN in RR-MS patients, with an increased connectivity in several brain areas mainly belonging to the prefrontal cortex, bilaterally (P < 0.05, cluster level corrected). Moreover, in the patient group, a significant inverse correlation was found between the length of COP path and the increased functional connectivity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (P < 0.001, uncorrected). Conclusion: These results show an increased functional connectivity within the cerebellar RSN in MS patients, mainly involving the frontal cortex.",

QMT-imaging included a B1-map, two RF-SPGR sequences with variable flip angles for T1-determination, 2 bSSFP sequences with variable flip angles for T2-determination, and 9 bSSFP scans using different RF pulse durations and flip angles to yield F, kf, and MTR. QMT-imaging was acquired within 8 minutes (isotropic resolution of 1.3 mm3). All newly appearing lesions during the study were semiautomatically segmented on whole-brain PD/T2w sequences and registered to the MT-maps of the previous and following MR-time points to track the lesion evolution longitudinally. QMT-values were normalized to the respective values of normal appearing WM. Lesional MT-changes were pronounced at the time of lesion appearance on conventional MRI, but not seen earlier with any MT-parameter. Average lesional qMT-changes were characterized by reduced F and kf (-39%, -46%), prolonged T1 and T2 (+14%, +36%), whereas MTRchanges were smaller (-13%). Reversed trends were observed 2 months later for qMT-parameters (F -35%, kf -38%, T1 12%, T2 28%), while MTR remained almost unchanged (-13%). Conclusion: Rapid whole-brain MT-bSSFP-imaging is feasible in 8 minutes. With bi-monthly MT-imaging, MS-lesions cannot be detected earlier than on conventional imaging. Lesional qMT-parameter changes are more pronounced than MTR changes. QMT-imaging provides quantitative tissue characteristics and allows studying the evolution of MS-lesions. QMT-imaging might thus be a useful adjunct for the diagnostic assessment and treatment monitoring in MS.

Conclusion: Even though initial results show no statistically significant connection between hippocampal volume reduction and cognitive tests, correlation coefficient indicates connection between hippocampal volume reduction, memory performance and cognitive productivity in patients with clinical signs of early cognitive decline. High hippocampal volume variability in study group could be explained with human cognitive function complexity. Also hippocampus plays significant role in memory and cognitive productivity performance, but there are other parts of brain which could have major impact on tested cognitive functions. Result: Anterior thalamic radiation and cingulum-cingulate gyrus were damaged in DLB (p<0.003), whereas cingulum-angular bundle was disrupted in AD (p<0.005). In DLB patients, secondary axonal degeneration within anterior thalamic radiation was related to microstructural damage within medio-dorsal thalamus (p<0.05), whereas axonal degeneration within cingulum-angular bundle was related to precuneus thinning (p<0.05). Conclusion: We posit that structural connectivity is affected within fronto-thalamic network in DLB and within mnemonic pathways in AD. Furthermore, the high correlation between GM and WM metrics within anterior thalamic radiation suggests that the structural connectivity alteration of these pathways could be caused by GM neuronal loss rather than by direct WM injury. Thus, this finding supports the key role of cortical and subcortical atrophy in DLB. Multiple reasons can account for a rise in intracranial pressure (Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, PTC), but frequently those reasons remain obscure (idiopathic Pseudotumor cerebri, idiopathic intracranial hypertension). In this speech, I am going to summarize the role of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of these entities. We will start recapitulating a few principle facts on brain/CSF pressure and why pressure can rise. It is emphasized that clinical signs and symptoms in patients can be unspecific so that choosing to look for MR-signs of PTC and selecting an appropriate MR protocol is essential. The audience will be familiarized with typical features of increased intracranial pressure such as optic-nerve sheath hydrops and \"empty-sella\" that can quite easily be interpreted using a combined MRI protocol covering the orbit, the pituitary, the brain and the venous sinuses. Ventriculomegaly and narrowed ventricles can occur in patients with increased pressure but looking at the size of the ventricles often is misleading.",

A diagnostic and therapeutic challenge is the spontaneous occurrence of CSF leakage. Despite typical clinical symptoms mainly characterized by orthostatic headache, the cranial and spinal MRI can reveal characteristic signs such as subdural fluid collection, saggital sagging of the brain, engorgement of veins and meningeal enhancement. Spinal infusion test and dynamic opticus ultrasound might complete diagnostics work-up. However, in cases of spontaneous CSF leakage detection of leakage site is demanding. Extrathecal fluid collections on high spatial resolution T2 or SPACE spinal MRI indicate the approximate location of leakage site; leakage itself might be proven by the intrathecal application of gadolinium application. However, due to low temporal resolution of MRI imaging, the value of the method to precisely locate leakage site is limited. In case of failed conservative treatment (bed rest), lumbar or local blood patch application has a high rate of clinical success. In case of surgical repair, the localization of leakage site and determination of the underlying pathology (e.g. focal disc hernia, boney spur or perineural cysts) is required. In this case leakage site can often be illustrated following intrathecal administration of iodine contrast media and dynamic evaluation of the spine under fluoroscopy (dynamic myelography).",

The discovery of mirror neurons in monkey brain and the evidence in the human brain of a mirror mechanism, whose neural substrate most likely relies on mirror neurons, support the notion that the motor system not only plays a role in the execution of actions but is also involved in understanding actions and in coding the intentions of others' actions. This experimental evidence bring further the role of the motor system and extend its role to functions traditionally considered as cognitive. It is worth underlining that motor experience and motor competence seem to be a necessary pre-requisite for any cognitive function. The mirror mechanism first described as related to mirror neurons seems to be a more general functional mechanism in the brain, extending also to emotions and sensations: the neural substrates active when processing the emotions and sensation felt by other people are also active when we ourselves feel the same emotions and the same sensations. This in turn may constitute a biologically grounded link between us and other individuals. As for canonical neurons, since these neurons are fundamental for coding the properties of objects relevant for acting upon them, they may allow individuals to make experience of the external world and interact with the environment in the most proper manner.",

            "text": "Conventional MRI represents the backbone of brain tumor identification and characterization but has limitations in distinguishing tumors from tumor mimics, defining tumor grade, evaluating treatment response and predicting patient outcome. Advanced MRI modalities, such as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have improved our understanding of brain tumours. DWI gives information about the apparent diffusion coefficient of water and provides an opportunity to examine differences in cell density and tissue structure. PWI measures hemodynamic properties, such as tissue blood volume, and provides an indirect estimation of the degree of tumor angiogenesis. MRS estimates the levels of various metabolites within brain tissue that may be helpful for evaluating tumor aggressiveness. Beyond MRI, metabolic imaging with PET provides further complementary insights into tumor biology; depending on the radiotracer used, various molecular processes can be visualized and a growing body of evidence supports the promising role of radiopharmaceuticals that target amino-acid transport. Increased radiolabeled amino acid uptake in brain tumors correlates with increased use of amino acids for energy, protein synthesis, and cell division. Furthermore, as brain tumor uptake of amino acid tracers is predominantly determined by expression and activity of the L-amino acid transporter system, brain tumor visualization and characterization does not depend on the status of the blood-brain barrier, thus allowing amino acid uptake to occur in both enhancing and nonenhancing tumor components. The contribution of these methods to the evaluation of pediatric brain tumors is the focus of the present work. Susceptibility weighted images (SWI) is an MRI sequence originally designed as a vascular sequence, which has now gained attention to the clinical scenario due to its versatility in identifying blood and minerals. In newborns and infants SWI are particularly useful in depicting germinal matrix hemorrhages, intraventricular hemorrhage and superficial siderosis. SWI delineates the morphology of the arterial and venous vasculature, allowing to identify arterial and venous thrombosis as well as venous rupture. Vascular stasis associated with brain edema or enlargement of the venous structures in the setting of hemiplegic migraine represent other useful applications of this sequence. SWI depicts acute and chronic sequels of traumatic brain injury such as micro-hemorrhages, fatty embolism, and diffuse perivascular injury. Given its ability to enhance the signal intensity of the blood, SWI is used to evaluate vascular malformations including cavernomas, developmental venous anomalies, capillary telangiectasias, and arteriovenous malformations. The corresponding PHASE image can be of further assistance in distinguishing calcified lesions from tiny vascular malformations. In the presence of necrotic lesions, SWI in association with ADC map and single voxel spectroscopy guide the differentiation between necrotic tumors and abscesses. Finally, SWI is used in the evaluation of metabolicneurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. At the end of this lecture, the attendees will be comfortable in using SWI as an additional tool in the diagnosis of vascular, neoplastic, inflammatory and infectious disorders of the CNS. Endovascular recanalization therapy of acute stroke patients with large vessel occlusion has become the most efficiant and accepted therapy. Succesfull recanalisation (TICI 2b and 3) with stentretrievers can be achieved in up to 75% of the patients, however that means up to 25% of acute vessel occlusions cannot be recanalized. The exact mechanism how stentretrievers work and interact with the clot is still unknown and a matter of intensive investigations. The clot itself shows a high variability concerning the length, location and composition.",

Reperfusion strategies are focused on attempted removal or disintegration of the thrombus / embolus with the objective of restoring an adequate flow in the hypo perfused, but still viable (penumbra), vascular territory. Restoring blood flow within a particular time window at the level of the ischemic penumbra leads to a reduction of the final size of the ischemic \"core\" and therefore to an improvement of the clinical outcome of the patient. In the last 10-15 years many studies showed that early recanalization of the obstructed vessel is the most important modifiable predictor of patient outcome. Despite the clinical efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis has been proven in numerous randomized trials, still about 50% of patients who suffer an ischemic stroke die or remain disabled. Patients with major neurological deficits, old age and a lack of recanalization after fibrinolytic therapy have a less favorable clinical outcome. The possibility of intra-arterial thrombolysis, alone or in combination with systemic one, may be a strategy to improve the outcome in patients who are not eligible for systemic therapy or in which there were no benefits after the same. This is common in patients with proximal vessels occlusion or with a high NIHSS scores. Endovascular intra-arterial procedures, both mechanical and pharmacological, are an alternative or additional option to intravenous thrombolysis. Their use, however, lead to negative or contradictory results in studies of past years. Four recent trials have demonstrated concordant and unambiguous evidence (level 1A) that thrombectomy is effective in patients with acute occlusion of major cerebral vessels. In each of the four trial patients were randomized to medical therapy (including tPA, if indicated) or medical therapy + thrombectomy. The number needed to treat to achieve a good functional outcome was 3-4. These trials have therefore called thrombectomy as a standard of care in selected patients with acute stroke. The criteria for selection of patients for thrombectomy are not yet defined. It is conceivable that they will be based on data from CT and CT angiography. For plain CT, ASPECT criteria are still considered valid (excluding patients with a score <7). The same evaluation can be performed with the same method on the partition images from CT angiography. Concerning this latter, it will be likely performed with biphasic technique. Those patients with a proximal arterial occlusion (M1/M2 MCA, vertebral or basilar artery) and efficient collateral flow should be candidate to reperfusion. CT perfusion is a further exam with potential in selecting these patients but there are no definite results concerning its clinical use. Despite the great potential of MRI (with diffusion and perfusion techniques) it is hard to imagine that MRI may play a role in this respect given the necessary extension of the diagnostic time that its use requires.",

Timely recanalization in large vessel occlusive disease is essential to achieving good outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). As such, the SWIFT PRIME study design incorporated aggressive time metrics and real time direct feedback. The benefit of such a quality initiative has not been systemically demonstrated in stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. Objectives: We sought to understand the relationship between functional independence and time to reperfusion. We then systemically investigated the time intervals spent during discrete patient process steps including patient transport, selection and treatment delivery in patients treated in the SWIFT PRIME trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data was analyzed from the SWIFT PRIME trial, a global, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) IDE study comparing the functional outcomes in AIS subjects treated with either IV t-PA alone or IV t-PA in combination with Solitaire device. The trial enrolled 196 patients between Dec 2012 and Nov 2014. Patients were equally randomized to 98 in control and 98 in intervention arm. Each patient enrollment was analyzed for workflow and direct feedback was provided to the enrolling site. Main Outcomes and Measures: Analysis of relationship between time from onset to reperfusion and outcome; time from imaging to reperfusion (in the mother ship patients) and outcome. Analysis of time intervals of discrete steps in patient workflow. Results: In the treatment arm, onset to reperfusion treatment time of 150 minutes lead to 87% estimated probability of good outcome which decreased by 10% with every 60 minute delay. . The median time from Emergency Department (ED) arrival to groin access was 90 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] , 69 -120) and ED arrival to reperfusion time was 139 minutes (IQR, 108 -169). In all patients, the median ED to imaging start time was 16 minutes (IQR, 10-23.5), imaging start to qualifying image time was 9 minutes (5-19.5) and qualifying image to randomization was 30 minutes (IQR, . In the patients undergoing endovascular therapy, randomization to puncture time interval was 22 minutes (IQR, 12-32), puncture to device deployment was 24 minutes (IQR, (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) , and deployment to reperfusion was 8 minutes (IQR, 5-23). Patients who initially arrived to a referring facility ('drip and ship' patients) had slightly faster rates of workflow once they arrived to the endovascular capable center compared to patients presenting directly to the endovascular capable center ('mothership' patients) but the 'drip and ship' patients had significant overall delays in treatment as compared to 'mothership' patients (onset to puncture-time, 179.5 minutes versus 275 minutes, p < 0.001). Puncture to device deployment interval was longer in patients with left sided lesions versus right sided lesions (32.5 vs 22 minutes, p = 0.046) and in patients with severe vessel tortuosity (29 vs 22 minutes, p=0.21). Conclusions and Relevance: Detailed attention to workflow with iterative feedback and aggressive time goals leads to highly efficient workflow. This study was performed across 39 centers and 7 countries and supports the generalizability of rapid workflow implementation. Future steps for improvement include faster triage and transport of patients to endovascular capable centers as well as advancements in treating patients with difficult anatomical features.",

In conclusion, these studies all showed superiority on stroke patient outcome by adding endovascular treatment with stent retrievers in the treatment of large vessel occlusions. Still, many controversies remain regarding both patient selection and the optimal technique. Which imaging modality is the best for properly selecting the patients that would benefit from the treatment? What is important in the pre-and posttreatment care of the thrombectomy patients? Which technique is to be preferred in the actual treatment? In this presentation, these issues will be discussed with special focus on problems with different selection methods, general anaesthesia versus conscious sedation, the use of balloon guide catheters and intermediate catheters as well as on special occasions that require specific technical considerations like tandem occlusions and acute dissections. Finally, a brief discussion will be initiated regarding the importance of clot composition for the technical considerations and the possibility to achieve a sufficient revascularization.",

The work flow from symptoms onset to recanalization has to be optimized outside and within the hospital; a challenge, taking into account the complexity of the rescue chain and the number of different professions involved. The most recent study results have shown great benefit of endovascular treatment in combination with intravenous thrombolysis compared to sole intravenous thrombolysis the for proximal vessel occlusions. Under this new light of endovascular stroke treatment regime, a few periprocedural aspects seem to have major impact on either time span to recanalization, clinical outcome after treatment, or both. Namely the role imaging (CT vs. MRI) and imaging protocols (CTA, CTP/MRA, MRP), the application of conscious sedation versus general anesthesia during intervention and the use of additional protection devices (guide catheter vs. balloon occlusion catheter vs. distal aspiration) is discussed. Despite the lack of randomized controlled trial focusing on these questions, the available data illustrates the pathway for an individualized decision making as well as an generally optimized workflow.",

Purpose: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a diagnostic challenge due to non-specific clinical and radiological symptoms. The first imaging modality is usually emergency brain CT. The purpose of the study was to retrospectively analyze emergency brain CT examinations in CVT cases and look for pitfalls. Methods: Emergency brain CT of 18 patients with CVT confirmed either in CTA, MRI or DSA were retrospectively analyzed. The study group consisted of 12 women and 6 men (mean age 37.9 yrs). The clinical symptoms were headache and seizures (12 cases), hemiparesis (4 cases) and loss of consciousness (2 cases). CVT causes were: oral contraceptives (3 women), hormonal infertility treatment (1 woman), cesarean section (1 woman), middle ear infection (2 children), nephrotic syndrome (2 subjects), advanced malignant disease (2 subjects), temporal bone fracture (1 subject) or unkown ( 5 cases). In 18 cases superficial CVT was diagnosed, in 2 cases additionally associated with deep venous thrombosis. Result: In 7 cases CVT was correctly diagnosed on the basis of CT showing hyperdense vessels and brain lesions in 4 cases and only hyperdense vessels in 3 cases. In 3 cases CT images were reported as normal due to very subtle radiological symptoms such as: hyperdense single cortical vein, hyperdense midline deep veins or subtle bilateral thalamic edema. In 6 cases hemorrhagic brain lesions due to CVT were misinterpreted as different pathologies and the hyperdense vessels were overlooked. In these cases bleeding vascular malformation, hemorrhagic brain tumors (2 cases), brain contusion and non-specific unequivocal lesions (2 cases) were reported. In 2 patients with pathologies of the temporal bone (middle ear infection and fracture) and no brain lesions CVT was not diagnosed during the first CT. Conclusion: CVT is underdiagnosed in the emergency brain CT. Clinical and radiological correlation with detailed CT image analysis is crucial especially in young patients with hemorrhagic lesions and non-specific clinical symptoms. cerebral venous thrombosis,emergency brain CT,pitfalls Conclusion: CJD exists in three forms: sporadic, hereditary and iatrogenic.It is rapidly progressive, characterized by dementia and always fatal. There is no single diagnostic test for CJD. Computerized tomography of the brain can help exclude stroke or brain tumor in emergency cases . MRI can reveal typical brain signal intensity abnormalities that can help diagnose CJD, and it is compulsory to use DWI with ADC map and FLAIR sequences in the protocol. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of CJD is by brain biopsy or autopsy. Purpose: Describe immediate intracranial complications seen on MRI after carotid stenting procedure and find potential associations with preprocedural brain MRI findings and carotid plaque characteristics. Methods: 22 patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were included. They were treated within the next 5 days of the acute event with stent with distal embolic protection and double antiplatelet therapy. Preprocedural Doppler and gray scale US of carotid stenosis were performed in all the patients. Plaques were classified in 4 groups based on echogenicity.",

Degree of carotid stenosis seen by pre-procedural Doppler was severe in 19 patients (86.5%), and moderate in 2 (9%). One patient had a thrombosed previous stent. The type of carotid plaques defined by US were heterogeneous 11 (50%), calcified 4 (18%), hypoechoic 5 (23%) and hyperechoic 2 (9%). Pre-stenting brain MRI showed that most patients had focal white matter lesions classified as grade I in 45%, and grade II in 27% (Fazekas scale). Only 2 (9%) patients had microbleeds, 12 (54.5%) patients showed chronic infarctions, and 19 (86%) patients showed acute minor infarction. Brain MRI findings after carotid stenting: Three patients developed territorial infarcts, two of them associated with heterogeneous carotid plaque on US, and the other one, which showed petechial hemorrhagic transformation, associated with hypoechoic plaque. Two patients showed parenchymal hemorrhage, one associated with heterogeneous carotid plaque and the other with hypoechoic plaque, which also presented signs of cerebral hyperperfusion. Eleven (50%) patients had cerebral microinfarcts in distal vascular territories of the affected carotid artery. Conclusion: Carotid stenting for symptomatic ICA stenosis was demonstrated to be a safe procedure in several past studies. However, in our experience, cerebral microinfarcts are frequently found finding after carotid stenting procedure but with no apparent clinical impact. Others MRI findings of major clinical importance were significantly small and include petechial hemorrhagic transformation, brain hematoma and cerebral hyperperfusion, which might have an association with the carotid plaque characteristics.",

Two non-blinded radiologists reviewed all non-enhanced CT (NECT)/CT angiography ( Purpose: Cerebrovascular accidents involving small vessel disease is common in Asia. Dual energy unenhanced CT brain with monochromatic reconstruction can provide superior image quality for the detection of acute pathology from small vessel disease by depiction of the subtle differences in contrast density. Methods: Patients referred for unenhanced CT brain study to exclude acute pathology were scanned on a 128 slice dual energy CT scanner with gemstone spectral imaging and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction algorithm for radiation dose savings. Images were reconstructed at different monochromatic levels ranging from 40 to 70 keV levels. The scans were assessed independently by 2 experienced neuroradiologists for image quality and detection of small vessel disease with acute pathology, consensus readings were made when there were differences in opinion. Subsequent imaging and clinical final diagnosis was used as the reference standard. Result: There were 43 patients scanned. Images at the lower 40keV level had superior contrast to noise ratio (CNR) but were impaired by poor signal to noise ratio (SNR). Images at 50 keV and 70 keV were generally comparable for image quality, with 50 keV superior for depiction of subtle differences in CNR in acute small vessel pathology. Conclusion: Dual energy unenhanced CT brain with monochromatic reconstruction at 50 keV maximises image quality for the depiction of small vessel disease. Purpose: The purposes of this study are to evaluate the depiction of brain ischemic stroke by using double inversion recovery (DIR) to compare the lesion-to-normal ratio (LNR) of DIR with that of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Methods: Seventy five patients underwent the MRI scans with FLAIR, DWI with b-value of zero (T2WI) and 1000 s/cm2 (DWI), and DIR sequences within 96 hours of onset. To obtain signals, two regions-of-interest were set in an infarction lesion (L) and a contralateral normal area (N) for each patient. The lesion-to-normal ratio (LNR), defined as LNR= 100(L-N)/N, was calculated for each sequence including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Patients were categorized into five groups according to the symptom onset time, which were Group I (onset less than 3 hours), Group II (onset more than 3 hours but less than 6 hours), Group III (onset more than 6 hours but less than 24 hours), Group IV (onset more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours), and Group V (onset more than 48 hours but less than 96 hours). To find effects of LNRs among imaging sequences in each group, , Friedman test was performed followed by post-hoc analysis. Purpose: Purpose: Neurodevelopmental outcome of children is a very serius issue which causes anxiety and inconvenience to parents of children who presented with cerebral infarction the first days of birth. We studied the neurodevelopmental outcome of children with cerebral infarct in relation to localization of the brain lesion. Methods: Methods: Our study includes three cases of children who were born with caesarian section and presented with clonic seizures during the first days of life. All of them underwent a brain MRI scan which revealed the presence of ischemic lesions at brain regions of middle cerebral distribution. They were also assessed for neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders. Result: Results: Brain MRI scans demonstrated: a) for the first newborn a recent ischemic lesion at the isle of Reil which is perfused from the right middle cerebral artery, b) for the second one acute ischemic infarct of the left thalamus, lenticular nucleus and isle of Reil, and c) for the last one cortical and subcortical infarct at the area of the left parietal lobe. Despite the severity of the brain lesions neurocognitive and behavioral assessment was normal in all cases. Conclusion: Conclusions: In our series the neurodevelopmental assessment of the children with infract in the distribution area of middle cerebral artery showed no neurodevelopmental impairment. This means that not all the cerebral infarcts have adverse effects on the brain development and cognitive function of the children and therefore counseling of the parents should be based on the exact involved anatomic area of the brain and not on the insult itself. NEONATAL STROKE,SEIZURES,NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOME Purpose: To evaluate the use of diluted iodinated contrast agents with normal saline or blood on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially T1-weighted images (T1WIs), T2WIs, and gradient echo (GRE) images, for distinguishing contrast staining from a hyperacute hemorrhage, which could occur after transarterial thrombolysis in acute stroke patients. Methods: On 3.0T MRI, T1WIs, T2WIs, and GRE images were scanned using a phantom with five different kinds of diluted nonionic iodinated contrast agents at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 1.2, 2, and 2.4 M I mole/L). The contrast agents were diluted with normal saline or venous blood sampled within 6 h. We compared the signal intensity (SI) of the phantom visually and quantitatively calculated the T1-and T2relaxation times. Result: The iodinated contrast agents had a T1-and T2-shortening effect. With increases in the concentration of the contrast agents, the effect of T1 and T2 shortening became more prominent. The T2shortening effect of the iodinated contrast agents was much weaker than that of venous blood. Although the SI of diluted iodinated contrast agents with normal saline was intermediate on GRE images, the SI of blood with/without iodinated contrast agents was dark on GRE images. Conclusion: On 3.0T MRI, the SI of iodinated contrast agents diluted with normal saline was different to that of blood or blood with contrast agent on T2WIs and GRE sequences.",

To specify the neuroanatomical correlation of walking ability in patients with stroke is important. We therefore aimed to reveal the correlation with the lesion location from MRI and walking ability at 3 months from attack Methods: 374 patients with first onset acute stroke (within 7 days after onset) were enrolled and took the MRI who visited the Severance hospital from August 2012 to December 2013. Brain MRI scans included fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion images obtained with standard parameter on a 3.0T Philips intera scanner, First, region of interest (ROI) surrounding the diffusion image lesion was drawn manually with a generous margin at each affected slice, using MRIcro software. The accuracy of lesion delineation was inspected visually at each slice, and the corresponding FLAIR was checked for confirming plausibility and extent of infarct ROI. Second, it was transformed to the standard brain MRI template using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) running under Matlab. The normalized lesion images were used as ROI for subsequent analysis in MRIcro and voxel-based statistical analysis. We examined walking ability measured by the FAC score(0-5) after 3 months and the patients were divided into two groups according to their independent walking ability at 3 months; the ambulatory group(FAC 3,4,5) and the nonambulatory group.(FAC 0,1,2), and then compare the lesion in the ambulatory and non-ambulatory group, using voxel by voxel chi square statistics. Purpose: Bilateral thalamic infarcts are rare presentations of stroke. They are the result of a complex combination of risk factors and a predisposing vessel distribution. Such infarcts are seen almost exclusively in the setting of vascular anomalies where a single artery supplies both sides of the brain. The occlusion of a rare arterial variant called the artery of Percheron(AOP) results in bilateral thalamic infarcts, with or without midbrain involvement. Methods: A 30-year-old man was admitted in Military Medical Academy in Belgrade, one day after experiencing occipital headache,decrease of consiousness and visual disturbance. The patient had no past medical history.On admission day his symptoms improved and the only abnormality on the physical and complete neurological examination was confusion.Initial brain CT performed in regional hospital was normal.",

Result: Brain MSCT showed bilateral thalamic hipodensities more prominent on the left side consistent with acute ischemic stroke.MSCT angiography showed patent posterior arterial circulation , including the tip of the basilar artery and both posterior cerebral arteries, as well as deep venous system( internal cerebral veins, Vein of Galen and streight sinus), making the case compatible with occlusion of the artery of Percheron. MRI of the brain showed bilateral thalamic areas of low signal intensities on fast spin echo T1weighted and high signal intensity on fast spin-echo T2 weighted and FLAIR images. At the same level, restricted diffusion on diffusion weighted images(DWI), was confirmed on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)maps , suggestive of acute ischemic injury.Follow up MRI showed tipical ischemic stroke evolution. Conclusion: Bilateral thalamic infarction represents a relatively rare stroke syndrome and presents with varying symptoms. The anatomic etiology is presumed to be the occlusion of Percheron artery, an uncommon vascular variation. The AOP is rarely visualized, even with conventional angiography, because it is too small. However, this can be utilized to roll out the involvement of larger vessels. This type of infarct has a favorable prognosis, although some patients experience persistent visual field deficits. Purpose: The superiority of the newer generation of endovascular devices over previous devices is well established. However it is important to update evaluations of the technical efficacy of these devices including quality of recanalization and the number and nature of complications from the procedure. The current study provides a detailed analysis of the catheter angiographic outcomes using the Solitaire revascularization device within the endovascular arm of a multicenter, international, randomized trial. Methods: The SWIFT PRIME trial is an RCT comparing IVtPA versus IVtPA + endovascular treatment using the Solitaire FR or Solitaire 2 devices. The trial was put on hold after enrollment of 196 patients over 39 sites by the DSMB. Use of suction either through a balloon guide catheter or through a distal access catheter in conjuction with the Solitaire device was recommended. All angiographic images were centrally adjudicated by a core lab regarding quality of reperfusion (TICI scale), quality of recanalization (AOL scale), and presence of angiographic complications. The number and size of device deployments was documented. Presence of intracranial hemorrhage subsequent to the procedure was documented and whether this was likely due to a complication from the angiographic procedure was centrally adjudicated by two experts. Result: Shall be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: The findings will provide insight into the technical success and complication rate of Solitaire FR device for endovascular treatment of stroke in multiple centers in the United States and Europe.

Weight-adjusted (70U/kg) heparin was used. Atropine (1mg) was given intravenously, if needed, to reduce bradycardia and hypotension potentially associated with carotid dilation. Acetylsalicylic acid (100mg/d) and clopidogrel (75mg/d) was continued for 3 months after the interventional procedure.

Three underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) followed by coronary artery bypass grafting, femoral arterypopliteal artery bypass, and aortic aneurysmal repair (AAR). Furthermore, two underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) followed by carotid endarterectomy, one underwent PCI followed by extracranial arteryintracranial artery bypass surgery (EC-IC BS), and one underwent EC-IC BS followed by AAR. The mean interstage interval of these seven cases was 2.4 months. There were no major adverse events (MAE) in the interstage interval of these or cerebrovascular treatments. One patient treated with EC-IC BS followed by AAR died due to major cerebral infarction after AAR. Conclusion: There were no MAE in the interstage interval of these treatments, and there were relatively few MAE in the perioperative period. MAE can lead to fatal complications, and therefore we should carefully consider the indications and sequence of treatments through multidisciplinary discussion. As it is unnecessary to discontinue antiplatelet therapy and have long interstage interval, a neuroendovascular approach may be preferable in patients in whom PCI is not an option. Pathophysiological mechanism is vasoconstriction which leads to reduced brain perfusion and result is vasogenic edema. Mortality rate is up to 15% of cases due to complications as acute hemorrhage and ischemia. Methods: 73-year-old men was admitted in Stroke hospital Sveti Sava in Belgrade with symptoms of headache, instability, loss of balance and discreet left sided hemiparesis. The symptoms started five days before admittance. He had a history of hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. We performed brain MSCT, MRI of brain with contrast, MR angiography and MRI spectroscopy. Result: Brain MSCT showed the presence of bilateral frontal and parietal patchy hypodense foci, more prominent on the right and in subcortically region. MRI scanning showed cortico-subcortical temporopolar, parieto-occipital, posteriorparietal and frontal bilateral lesions more dominant on the right. Those lesions were hyperintense in T2W /FLAIR sequence with mild compressive effect on occipital horn and body of the right lateral ventricle. There was no postcontrast enhancement of lesions. On DWI sequence there were no changes in signal intensity, but on ADC map hyperintensity of the signal was observed in parieto-occipital and frontal regions bilaterally. That implicated the existence of vasogenic edema and suggested PRES. MR angiography was normal. Using 2D multivoxel spectroscopy the obtained spectra showed slightly higher values of choline and creatine (Cho/Cr), and NAA was mildly decreased. After diagnosing the patient was regularly treated with antihypertensive, antilypemic and rehydration therapy and was discharged two weeks later with normalized neurological findings. Follow up MR scanning, two months after the initial one, showed complete regression of T2W/FLAIR hyperintense changes which had previously affected cortex and subcortical white matter. Conclusion: Until recently it was thought that PRES tipically affects bilaterally and simetrically white matter, predominantly in occipital and posterior parietal areas. Less frequent, changes were described as asymmetric, involving frontal and temporal lobes, basal ganglia and cortical grey matter. Magnetic resonance scanning is crucial for diagnosing, monitoring and assessing the treatment effectiveness of this syndrome. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between clinical response with and without computed tomography perfusion (CTP) mismatch in stroke patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 130 patients presenting with hyperacute stroke within the first 6 hours after symptom onset, in Stroke hospital Sveti Sava in Belgrade, from March 2010 to March 2015. All patients on admission underwent multimodal cerebrovascular computed tomography (CT) imaging protocols, including parenchymal imaging-noncontrast head CT, vascular imaging-CT angiography and penumbral imaging-CTP. One hundred patients from experimental group were treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and thirty patients from control group were not treated with rtPA. Mismatch was defined as a perfusion lesion (CBF lesion) > 20% larger than the core lesion (CBV). CTP was used to categorize patients into Mismatch versus Absence of mismatch subgroup. Good clinical outcome was defined by improvement of NIHSS > 3 points, and excellent outcome was defined as reduction in NIHSS > 7 points at day 30. CT perfusion,acute stroke,mismatch Purpose: Efficacy and safety of Solitaire stent thrombectomy in acute occlusion of intracranial artery has been proved in many previous studies. However, most of these studies were focused on occlusion of proximal vessels such as distal ICA (T-segment), M1 segment of middle cerebral artery (MCA), or basilar artery (BA), and there are not many studies about usefulness of Solitaire stent in small intracranial vessel occlusion such as M2 segment occlusion. Therefore, our study aimed to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy using Solitaire stent in patients with small vessel occlusion (M2 segment of MCA). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 28 patients who underwent Solitaire stent thrombectomy for treatment of M2 occlusion between November 2014 and March 2014. We evaluated immediate angiographic results and clinical outcomes through reviewing of patient's electrical medical records. Result: The ratio of patients' sex was 1: 1 (man = 14, women = 14) and mean age was 71. 32 (range, 51 -84). The rate of successful recanalization (TICI grade > 2b) was 71.43% (20/28). Among these 20 patients, 16 patients were treated with Solitaire thrombectomy as the single treatment technique and 4 patients were treated in combination with urokinase. Mean initial NIHSS score was 12.80 (range, 2-21) and was 8.24 (range, 0-30) at discharge. Favorable clinical outcomes (mRS score at 3 months < 2) were seen in 17 patients out of 28 (60.71%). Migration of tiny emboli was observed in 2 (7.14 %) but 1 of them presented no neurologic symptom (mRS score at 3 months = 0). Post-procedural symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage has occurred in 1 patient (3.57 %). Conclusion: Mechanical thrombectomy using Solitaire stent appears to be safe and is capable of achieving high rate of successful recanalization and favorable clinical outcomes in patients with distal cerebral vessel occlusion (M2). Acute stroke,Thrombolysis,Angiography Purpose: Background: The importance of 'time is brain' is well known. Rapid workflow targets were established for the SWIFT PRIME trial. Targets for time from acquisition of qualifying parenchymal imaging to groin puncture were: optimalwithin 70 minutes, acceptablewithin 90 minutes. Targets for time from groin puncture to reperfusion were optimalwithin 20 minutes, acceptablewithin 30 minutes. This study provides a detailed analysis of this workflow within the endovascular arm of the trial. . Methods: Methods: The details of the SWIFT PRIME trial have been previously described. The process of ensuring and improving workflow efficiency in the endovascular arm was based on the following: 1. Site selection: only those sites were chosen to participate who could successfully demonstrate CT head to recanalization in < 90 minutes in at least 5 patients. 2. Extensive training in workflow including teamwork and parallel proces",

ICA agenesis was first described in 1787, after a postmortem examination of a patient and there are approximately only 100 cases reported in the literature. When a unilateral ICA is absent, collateral circulation can be sufficient to maintain cerebral function with few or no neurologic symptoms.The purpose of this work is to describe a very rare case, as it is the internal carotid artery agenesis. Methods: We report a case of a 46 years old woman who was evaluated in our department for bilateral action tremor. A Magnetic Resonance (MR) and a computed tomography (CT) were performed. Result: The MR showed agenesis of the right ICA, clinically asymptomatic. Further investigation with CT confirmed the absence of the right carotid canal. The vascular supply of the anterior cerebral hemisphere was possible due to collateral circulation via Circle of Willis and no parenchymal abnormalities were seen on MR. Conclusion: The term absence has been chosen to incorporate agenesis, aplasia, and hypoplasia of the ICA. Agenesis is defined as complete failure of an organ to develop, aplasia as lack of development (but its precursor did exist at one time), and hypoplasia as incomplete development of the organ. Although an exact cause of these developmental anomalies has not been established, all three variations are thought to represent the sequela from an insult to the developing embryo.",

Reis 2 1 Hospital de Braga -Neuroradiology Department, Braga, PORTUGAL, 2 Hospital de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 -Neuroradiology Department, Lisboa, PORTUGAL Purpose: In acute intracranial arterial occlusion with sudden neurologic deficit, limited time is available to obtain information for carefully directed treatment. CT angiography (CTA) is commonly used in most stroke centres to obtain information on the clot location and presence of collaterals. This data can influence treatment decision and clinical outcome in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. CTA is a static technique, that gives little information on the flow direction of collaterals. Transcranial Doppler and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) complement CTA and provide dynamic information on collateral circulation and flow direction in the circle of Willis. Methods: A 55-year-old man, previously asymptomatic, was assessed in the emergency room with a history of aphasia, right sided hemiparesis and sensory loss lasting for one hour. CT scan upon arrival revealed the presence of an hyperdense Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) (superior M2 division), with no apparent acute ischemic lesions. CTA was performed showing a severe stenosis of the distal cervical segment of the left ICA. A strong hyperattenuation of the ICA, immediately after the stenosis and extending to the supraclinoid segment was found and could not be explained. Both MCAs showed symmetric density and a left M2 occlusion was confirmed. DSA confirmed occlusion of the left superior division of M2, and the severe cervical stenosis was in fact a dissection of the ICA. Collateral perfusion of the left MCA was done through the anterior communicating artery, with no significant circulatory delay.",

            "text": "(1) a severe cervical ICA stenosis, and (2) presence of collateral flow coming from the anterior communicating artery, washing out the contrast from the distal ICA and leaving a \"sequestered\" segment with no signs of clot formation. This sign was most probably related to contrast stasis and to a longer acquisition time of the CTA. Purpose: Correct evaluation of the degree of carotid stenosis in DSA is a crucial factor when deciding for revascularization treatment. We sought to compare the accuracy of \"naked eye\" assessment of the degree of carotid stenosis by an experienced neurointerventionalist, a neuroradiology resident and a stroke unit physician, with the calculated NASCET score. Methods: We reviewed our institution imaging archive and chose forty cases of suspected carotid stenosis. Standard PA and lateral projection DSA images were presented to an experienced neurointerventionalist, a neuroradiology resident (4th year) and a stroke unit physician for them to estimate the degree of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The NASCET score was calculated for each ICA in the angio suite workstation. Observers were blinded to the NASCET score results. Interobserver agreement was analyzed with Pearson correlation coefficient and kappa statistic. Result: Forty carotid bifurcations were studied. Stenosis degree ranged from 0% to total occlusion. Interobserver correlation coefficients ranged from 0,866 to 0,950. Correlation of eye estimation with NASCET measurements was high (from 0,878 to 0,950), being highest with both neuroradiologist observers. Interobserver agreement was slight to fair (kappa ranged from 0,166 to 0,33). Interobserver agreement was higher for high grade stenosis (>70%) especially between consultant and resident (kappa 0,510). There was total agreement for occlusions between the three observers. Seven significant discrepancies were identified, all of which were overestimation of low grade stenosis. The consultant had the lower number of discrepancies (only two). One external carotid stenosis was mistaken for the internal carotid by the stroke physician. Purpose: Tentorial artery arises from the dorsal aspect of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. This vessel often play role as the feeder of dural arteriovenous fistulae or skull base brain tumors. Embolization from tentorial artery is rarely required for curative or palliative transarterial embolization for shunt disease, or preoperative embolization with subsequent tumor removal. We report technical tips and potential risks of transarterial embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate from tentorial artery. Methods: Between 2009 and 2014, 3 patients were treated by transarterial embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate from tentorial artery under general anesthesia. The etiologies consisted of two tentorial dural arteriovenous fistulae and a cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistula. Mean follow-up period of three cases was 7 months, 14 months and 37 months. Result: In all patients, superselective catheterization to tentorial artery was successfully achieved. Transarterial embolization was performed with n-butyl cyanoacrylate, ranged from 20% to 40% concentration. Balloon assist technique was applied for catheterization of the microcatheter by positioning the balloon just distal to the branch, and protection of the internal carotid artery from reflux of the glue by inflating the balloon at the orifice of the branch in all cases. Transient abducens palsy occurred in 1 case as a complication related to the procedure. N-butyl cyanoacrylate did not migrate into the internal carotid artery, therefore there were no ischemic complication associated with procedures. During the follow-up period we confirmed no recurrence of the shunt by cerebral angiography or 3-Tesla magnetic resonance angiography in all cases. Conclusion: Vascular network around the cavernous portion of internal carotid artery has many variations, and wedged glue injection causes the opening of undesirable vascular channel and the glue migration associated with significant complications, therefore a wedged position of the microcatheter should be avoided. As microcatheter tends to be wedged more easily in low flow feeders, particular attention should be paid in embolization of these feeders. A stable position of the microcatheter and a careful protection of the internal carotid artery using the balloon support may lead to effective embolization from tentorial artery. Purpose: We encountered a case of arteriovenous shunt of the trigeminal nerve root. This shunt was fed mainly by a branch from basilar artery, and also by right caroticotympanic artery. In the literature this type of lesions were described as \"arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of trigeminal nerve\" in some cases, and \"dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) of Meckel's cave\" in other cases. We discuss the etiology of this kind of lesions. Methods: Case: A 42 year-old male was referred to our hospital with suspicion of brain AVM, which was incidentally pointed out by MR. The patient was totally asymptomatic. The MRA revealed small arteriovenous shunt fed by a branch from basilar artery, draining into superior petrosal sinus. Angiography demonstrated that this shunt was also fed from right caroticotympanic artery. The main feeder was branching from upper third of bailar artery, above the AICA. It seemed to be a remnant of trigeminal artery. The nidus was confirmed to be within the nerve root of the trigeminal artery by the axial reconstruction of 3D angiography. Purpose: To find out if any changes of brain regions functional interaction take place in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy during seizure-free period. Methods: All 15 patients with CE (10 men, 5 women) and 15 healthy controls (HC) (10 men, 5 women) underwent MRI (incl. resting state fMRI) on 3,0T field strength MR system. Functional images were acquired using an echo planar imaging sequence aligned along the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line were acquired. In each session, a total of 80 volumes were collected, resulting in a total scan time of 480 s. For each patient, one or two sessions were acquired. Subjects were instructed simply to rest with their eyes closed, not to think of anything in particular, and not to fall asleep. Data were analysed using Matlab-based software (SPM12, CONN14 Purpose: Epilepsy is a common presenting or complicating feature of the neurocutaneous syndromes. This poster presentation will educate the reader in the spectrum of neuroimaging findings in a range of phakomatoses and develop an understanding of their association with epilepsy. We aim to provide a structure for the accurate diagnosis of neurocutaneous syndromes and to enhance the readers' appreciation of how neuroradiology can assist in the management of epilepsy in these conditions. Methods: We will review the current literature and illustrate cases from our own epilepsy surgery surveillance program. These include tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 and incontinentia pigmenti. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical records and imaging studies of three patients who met diagnostic criteria for Leigh syndrome at our institute in the last 5 years. The age of the patients ranged from 9 months to 3 years at the time of diagnosis. Result: Two patients presented with motor and intellectual developmental delay. One of them also had seizures. Interestingly, the other patient presented with symmetrical flaccid paralysis and was previously diagnosed as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). But SURF1 mutation was later identified in this patient. Elevated lactate was found in the serum of all patients and one cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. MRI and MR spectroscopy were performed in all patients. Symmetrical hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images were found at the subthalamic nuclei, brainstem, periaqueductal gray matter, dentate nuclei, and medulla in all patients. Two patients also had abnormalities at the basal ganglia. Some of these lesions showed restricted diffusion and variable enhancement. MR spectroscopy in 2 patients showed reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA), elevated lactate and elevated choline. Conclusion: Symmetrical brainstem lesions in specific location with or without basal ganglia abnormalities in a child with neurological problems should prompt the clinician and radiologist to consider Leigh syndrome.",

T1WI are used to evaluate the decrease in muscle volume and to show the signal changes from fat infiltration into muscle grading it according to the well-stablished rating scales. STIR helps in muscle edema detection. Result: We show some of the WB-MRI muscle patterns of patients with proven CM, CMD and LGMD, such as Nebulin (NEB), Ryanodine Receptor-1 (RYR1), Caveolin-3 (Cav3), Collagen-6 (Col6), Dynamin-2 (DNM2), Myotubularin-1 (MTM1), Titin (TTN), Selenoprotein N-1 (SEPN1), Four and a half LIM domains protein-1 (FHL1), Lamin A/C (LMNA), Laminin alpha-2 (LAMA2), and some LGMD, among others. We are able to show WB-MRI of patients from infancy to adulthood, their evolution and progression, trying to help in diagnosing these diseases in early stages for preventing further related complications. Furthermore, WB-MRI helps in targeting the appropriate muscle for biopsy. Conclusion: WB-MRI is of great value in providing useful additional information not only to target the most appropriate genetic investigations, but also to monitorize disease evolution in Neuromuscular Disorders. Therefore, this late-onset type is classified as a cardiac variant in the literature. The neurological involvement of this late-onset type is still unclear. The study was aimed to understand the brain MRI of this lateonset type. Methods: Two neuroradiologists retrospectively analyzed all brain MRI findings from IVS4 Fabry patients, the sex-age matched stroke patients and normal control (NC) group in our hospital. Result: 29 patients (18 males and 11 females) of IVS4 mutations, the sex-age matched stroke patients and normal control group underwent MRI at mean age of 55.3, 55.3 and 55.6 years, respectively. Infarction was found in 8 (28%) IVS4 Fabry patients, 29 (100%) in stroke patients, and 0(0%) in NC. The positive pulvinar sign were 6 (21%) in IVS4 Fabry patients, 0 (0%) in stroke patients, and 0 (0%) in NC group (p<0.05). No significant difference was found in the Fazekas scores among all groups. The basilar artery diameter was significantly higher in the stroke group, 2.90 (\u00b1 0.56) mm, but there was no difference between IVS4 group and other two groups. The height of basilar artery bifurcation were at the dorsum sellae, within suprasellar cisterns, at third ventricular floor for 6(21%), 10(34%), 13(45%) IVS4 patients; 4(14%), 20(69%), 4(14%) stroke patients; and 11(38%), 12(41%), 6(21%) normal control (p<0.05). Conclusion: Patients with late-onset Fabry disease presented with higher incidence of pulvinar sign than stroke and NC group.

Image analysis was performed independently by two experienced neuroradiologists. Good biochemical control was as previously defined as a lifetime median free homocystine of 11 umol/L. Biochemical control of these patients during long-term treatment was calculated as lifetime median of fHcy for each patient. For each group, a mean is obtained from the lifetime medians of fHcy. Result: The mean age of the study group was 22.6 years (15-36) yrs. There were no reported neurological or radiological abnormalities in the 'newborn screened, good control' group. Ten patients in the 'newborn screened, poor control' and 'late-detected' groups combined had abnormal appearances consistent with microinfarcts on MRI. One of these patients had superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Of the ten patients with radiological abnormalities 2 had cerebrovascular accidents and 7 had positive findings on neurological examination. Conclusion: MRI can be used to demonstrate the cause of stroke symptoms in HCU patients, as well as silent cerebrovascular disease in this cohort. Our study shows that radiological abnormalities are more common in patients with poor biochemical control. Brain imaging therefore has useful roles in the diagnosis of microinfarcts and/or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in HCU patients presenting with stroke, in the detection of 'silent' cerebrovascular complications in poorly controlled disease, and also in reassurance of asymptomatic HCU patients who are at increased risk. Prasat Neurological Institute, Bangkok, THAILAND Purpose: Prasat Neurological Institute has been using the X-ray machine for more than 10 years.However,they are now worn-out and need to be replaced.Nowadays,medical technology exists in a variety of highly advance forms.Therefore,the decision to purchase an expensive medical equipments must concern about the benefit of patients along with an appropriate budget that need regard of technology assessment. The digital radiography system are classified into 2 main types, Digital Radiography (DR) and Computed Radiography(CR). The objective of this study is to compare the advantages and disadvatages between them to obtain and increase new knowledge in present and future. Methods: To gather knowledge,we search from academic journals in internet.We also make questionnaire to know satisfactory levels of users such as technologist in X-ray department of Ratwithi hospital and two other private hospital using digital radiography system. Result: After we have analyzed the information,the research shows that Digital Radiography system is better than Computed Radiography in the aspects of lower x-ray exposure to patients and better quality of X-ray image. The patients also receive faster and more convenient service. Purpose: Radiation exposure is inherent in neurovascular interventional radiology (IR). A potential exposure of 1 mSv has been suggested as a cutoff for provision of risk information, as it corresponds to a 1 in 10000 increased cancer risk. Informed consent requires disclosure of rare yet potentially significant risks, yet patient and non-radiologist physician knowledge of these risks is lacking. Neurovascular IR patient perception and knowledge of these risks remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore neurovascular IR patient perception of cancer-related radiation risk exposure and whether radiation consent is warranted. Methods: A multiple-choice survey was administered to 42 adult patients undergoing a non-emergent neurovascular IR procedure at a tertiary care centre. 67% of patients had previously undergone a neurovascular IR procedure. Statistical analysis of with Fisher Exact test was performed based on patient past neurovascular IR history (p<0.05).",

            "text": "Result: Almost all subjects (90%) wanted to be informed if the radiationrelated increased cancer risk was 1 in 100. Most (82%) wanted to be informed if the risk was moderate, 1 in 1000, or low, 1 in 10000 (70%). Only half of the patients were aware that they were exposed to radiation during their procedure, irrespective of previous neurovascular IR history. The majority (74%) believed that the ordering physician should be responsible for informing patients about radiation exposure. Most (85%) believed radiation consent should include radiation-related cancer risks, and that both verbal and written radiation consent should be obtained (74%). No significant difference was present based on past neurovascular IR history (p>0.05). Conclusion: Neurovascular IR patient awareness of radiation exposure is suboptimal. Based on this survey, most patients want to discuss cancerrelated radiation risks with the ordering physician in order to make informed decisions. This is potentially concerning as non-radiologist ordering physicians may not be as knowledgeable on radiation-related cancer risks. Neurointerventional radiologists should consider obtaining informed consent for procedures with anticipated doses of 1 mSv or greater. Overall, the rate of procedure-related complications was 6.4% (10/156). Follow-up angiography more than 1 year after the coil embolization was obtained in 42 patients with 43 aneurysms. Of these, recanalization was observed in 5 aneurysms (11.6%); 34 aneurysms (79.1%) unchanged; and 4 aneurysms (9.3%) showed progressive thrombosis. Conclusion: In our experience, removal and reposition of the Solitaire stent allowed for reducing thromboembolic complications and making the coiling procedure faster and easier in selected patients. Considering the good clinical outcome with the low rates of both procedural complication and recurrence, Solitaire stent-assisted coil embolization seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. Fenestration, early bifurcation, and duplication of the PCA are rare. So-called hyperplastic anterior choroidal artery (AChA) can be regarded as a PCA variation. Methods: We reviewed intracranial MR angiographic images of 2256 patients examined using a 3 T scanner (Achieva 3T, Philips). MR angiographic images from the skull base to the intracranial region were obtained using the standard time-of-flight technique without contrast media. Excluding 51 patients whose MR angiographic image quality was insufficient or whose PCA(s) was occluded, we retrospectively evaluated the images of 2205 patients using a PACS system. Result: PCA fenestration was found in 11 (0.50%) patients. Most were found at the P1 segment, P1-P2 junction, or P2 segment, and the majority of the fenestrations were small in size. Early bifurcation at the P1-P2 junction or proximal P2 segment was detected in 8 (0.36%) patients. Complete duplication was diagnosed in one patient. Hyperplastic AChA was found in 12 (0.54%) patients. Ten of the 12 supplied the temporal branch of the PCA, and the remaining 2 supplied entire branches of the PCA. Conclusion: PCA variations were found in 32 (1.45%) patients. Because the name hyperplastic AChA seems to be inadequate, we propose calling this variation accessory PCA or replaced PCA.

Suh 1 1 Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA Purpose: Several definitions have been proposed to distinguish from the daughter sac in treatment decision of the unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to evaluate interobserver variability of aneurysm morphology, including the daughter sac, from the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) and The Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysm Study of Japan (UCAS). Methods: After approval by the institutional review board, we analyzed 4 morphological definitions (daughter sac, lobulation and irregular margin) from the ISUIA and UCAS using angiographic images of 102 saccular aneurysms. 4 independent readers interpreted each morphological criterion with the dichotomized scales (existence or not). The kappa statistics were performed to measure interobserver agreement and kappa > 0.6 was considered substantial agreement.",

            "text": "Result: In discrimination of the daughter sac, interobserver agreement among 4 readers was substantial for the UCAS (kappa = 0.626 in 2D and 0.659 in 3D images) and not for the ISUIA (kappa =0.487 in 2D and 0.473 in 3D), which had a significant difference. Irrespective of the used images, pairwise pooled kappa values for the UCAS were more than 0.6 except one case (score of 0.54 between reader A and B). In proportion of positive reads, there was significant difference between reads of daughter sac by the UCAS and those by the ISUIA. Conclusion: In discrimination of the daughter sac, the UCAS definition showed a higher reliability than the ISUIA. However, a further prospective study is necessary to validate this definition as treatment standard for the unruptured intracranial aneurysm. Purpose: Endovascular embolization is a well-established treatment of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms, but concern about its long-term stability are still present. To date, few data is available about the long term anatomical results after coil embolization and there is no evidence on how long it is necessary to sustain imaging follow-up. The present study aimed to address whether it is necessary to pursue late imaging follow-up, by comparing recanalization, retreatment and newly detected aneuryms in a prospective cohort of patients harboring coiled aneurysms imaged 5 and 10 years after treatment.",

            "text": "Methods: This was a retrospective analysis based on a prospectively collected cohort of patients with intracranial aneurysm treated by endovascular embolization from January 2001 to December 2004. In our center, since January 2001, a systematic follow-up procedure was proposed to each patients, with clinical and imaging (angiography and MRI) assessment. Here, we included all patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: 1/ ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysm; 2/ treated by endovascular coiling only; 3/ imaging follow-up available at 5 and 10-years after treatment; 4/ without severe artifacts. We tested whether there was a difference in clinical and imaging data at 5 and 10-years of follow-up. Result: Among the 240 aneurysms (178 ruptured, 62 unruptured) treated during the inclusion period, 120 completed the 10-years imaging followup (80,0% of the survivors). Recanalization occured more frequently before 5-years than thereafter (between 5-10 years) (21,7%vs8,3%,P<0, 0001). This result was sustained in ruptured and unruptured subgroup analysis. Retreatment was more frequent before 5-years than thereafter (16,3%vs5,8%,P=0,01), and there was one case of rebleeding. The proportion of newly detected aneurysm was small and comparable at 5 and 10-years (1,5%vs3,3%,P=0,43). We identified ruptured aneurysms (P=0, 02 ;OR not assessable due to only positive cases) and development of a neck remnant during the first 5-years (OR 6, 35[1, 1] ;P=0,01) as potential predictors of recanalization at 10-years. Conclusion: Recanalization and retreatment are more likely to occur within the first 5-years after coiling. However they are not so infrequent 10years after treatment. This was particularly true for ruptured aneurysms and those developing neck remnant within 5-years, so that delayed follow-up seems mandatory at least in these cases. Purpose: In Japan, this coil called ED coil-10 Extra soft (EDC-10 ES) is frequently used as a finishing coil for emobolization of cerebral aneurysms. Its very soft and flexible 30mm tip prevents kicking back of the micro catheter from the neck of the aneurysm. This presentation discusses some advantages of this ED coil. Methods: This ED coil is frequently used as a finishing coil for emobolization of cerebral aneurysms. The smallest 1.5mm size coil is available with 1cm, 2cm and 3cm primary coil lengths. In the final stage of cerebral aneurysm embolization, we often find that some detachable coils with a small primary diameter are not able to detach, because the coil and the microcatheter are kicked back outside of the aneurysm. However, even if such kicking back occurs once or twice, eventually it was often possible to detach the coil with EDC-10 ES. It is extremely soft, therefore I think the coil efficiently searches for open space inside the aneurysm and fills these spaces in. This contributes to achieve high VERs. I want to present a few cases of neuro endovascular treatment with ED coils, and consider the effectiveness and diversity of them. eg. SAH case due to basilar trunk perforating aneurysm, SAH case due to Right BA-SCA aneurysm Result: Finally, EDC-10 ES is also able to be used with a flow guide catheter, for example Magic catheter or Marathon catheter. Marathon was originally developed as a liquid delivery catheter with a 1.5-F smaller distal tip , which could be navigated further to the intracranial arteries.",

Alteration of sexual functioning this group is almost unheard of. The aim of the study is to elucidate and establish pre existing neurocognitive deficits and sexual functioning in AVM patients and their post intervention status alterations. Methods: This is a prospective study of male patients with cerebral AVMs who underwent neuroimaging prior to treatment work up . Detailed neurocognitive assessments for both pre and 6 months post intervention were performed (surgical excision, neuroendovascular procedures) and also those who were conservatively managed. The neuropsychological performances were measured using the Screening-Neuropsychological Assessment Battery while the sexual functioning of these patients were assessed using the Nowinski and Licocopolo's Sexual History Form. Anatomic imaging details of the AVMs were documented for association study and analysis. Result: There were 11 male patients recruited (mean age : 35.5 years).Significant alteration in both neuropsychological performance and sexual functioning were seen among these patients. Patients who were surgically managed and those who underwent endovascular procedures performed poorly in most domains including attention, memory and executive function. Impaired preoperative sexual functioning status were mostly unchanged post procedures. Structural anomaly or architectural alteration to the frontal, extrastriate, posterior parietal cortexes and as well as the anterior cingulate,ventral striatum, septal nuclei and corpus callosum were noted. Conclusion: Changes in neuropsychological performance and sexual functioning among patients with cerebral AVM is more common than previously thought. Changes in sexual functioning are more common in frontal AVM than other substructures in the limbic circuitry. While some improvements were noted some functions, further deterioration of cognitive functions were also seen. Periodic pre-operative and post operative assessment may enabling better prognostication, patient management and rehabilitation.

Comparative analysis was performed between the methods for vasospasm diagnosis and determined the incidence of delayed ischemic stroke and distribution in subgroups according Fisher graduate. Result: Were diagnosed 26 cases of moderate / severe vasospasm (72, 2%), with agreement between the methods presented 92,8 % sensibility and 90,9% specificity for CT angiography. The presence of ischemic stroke resulting from the delayed vasospasm is demonstrated in fourteen patients (53,8%). The occurrence of SAH Fisher 3 or 4 related to higher incidence of vasospasm and delayed ischemic stroke Patients with acute SAH Fisher 1 or 2 showed no moderate / severe vasospasm on Angio-TC or digital angiography. No patient in this subgroup had delay ischemic stroke. Conclusion: Our data indicate that CT angiography is highly specific for the diagnosis of moderate or severe vasospasm. As an additional finding was observed an incidence of ischemic stroke in about one-half of this cases demonstrating a relatively low correlation between moderate and severe cases of vasospasm and presence of delayed cerebral ischemia. The diagnosis of moderate / severe vasospasm (> 50 % ) with Angio-TC , regardless of the location of the aneurysm, was predictor of delay ischemic stroke.",

Conclusion: Atypical presentations of rupture of intracranial aneurysms are infrequent, despite this, the radiologist plays a crucial role in the recognition of all forms of this serious condition, whose prognosis depends directly on the early diagnosis and right conduct. Purpose: Small cerebral aneurysms are technically challenging to embolize because of difficult catheterization and high risk for intraoperative rupture. Because of the unfavorable sac/to/neck ratio, it is almost always necessary to use stent-assisted coiling. We analyzed our data for seven patients treated by stent-assisted coiling for wide-necked small intracranial aneurysms to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of endovascular treatment for these lesions. Methods: Five patients were treated for unruptured aneurysms sized 3 -4 mm, while two cases were ruptured, blister-like aneurysms (Image 1). There were six women and one man aged from 37 to 67 years. The localization of aneurysms was supraclinoid ICA in 5 cases and posterior circulation in 2 cases (one origin of SCA and one P1 segment). We used LEO+ stent in four cases, LVIS stent in one case and Enterprise stent for 2 cases in posterior circulation.",

In one case of blister-like aneurysm, after stent placement the aneurysm shrinked to size under 2 mm, so we interrupted the procedure.

The enhancing brain lesions appeared respectively two months and one month following the endovascular procedures. The lesions were discovered following seizures in the first patient and phasic disorders in the second. The enhancing lesions were peripheral with a cortico-meningeal topography, within the territory where the vascular procedure was performed (respectively the right and left internal carotids), making embolic phenomenon very likely. They consisted of nodular or micronodular enhancing lesions with peripheral edema and micro-abcesses in one patient A comprehensive enquiry allowed to rule out infectious or neoplastic lesions and other granulomatous affections like sarcoidosis. Brain biopsy was performed in one patient and showed lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration with slight vascular lesions. Corticosteroid treatment allowed the regression of the lesions and the symptoms in both patients. Conclusion: Brain enhancing lesions following endovascular treatment of aneurysms are rare. However, due to the increasing number of these procedures, their incidence may increase in the years to come. Though some cases have been described to be asymptomatic, both of our patients were highly symptomatic and required a specific treatment.

Many lesions were included in hemorrhagic intra-axial masses, such as glioblastoma, PNET(primitive neuroectodermal tumor), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma(PXA), pilocytic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma, cavernous malformation and hemorrhagic metastasis(lung cancer, melanoma, choriocarcinoma, renal cell ca). Included extra-axial hemorrhagic masses were acoustic schwannoma, hemangiopericytoma, and meningioma. We will also present the differential imaging clues between the hemorrhagic mass and pure ICH. Result: Most hemorrhagic masses usually showed localized lesion, internal septa-like structure, or layering, relatively heterogeneous attenuation or signal intensity, and showed confined outer border, compared with pure ICH. Conclusion: There are many causes in intracerebral hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic tumor must be differentiated from pure ICH for different surgical treatment. Tumor bleeding may be differentiated from pure ICH with imaging clues, which are localized form, with internal septa-like structure, or layering, relatively heterogeneous attenuation or signal intensity, and showing relatively confined outer border. Purpose: Differentiation between tumors and tumor-like lesions in the brain is essential for planning adequate treatment and for estimating outcome and future prognosis. The radiologist should be aware of all non-neoplastic pathologies and diseases that may mimic tumors. Sometimes, high-end integrating multiple modalities and clinical correlation is mandatory. A broad spectrum of non-neoplastic conditions can mimic a brain tumor, or on the contrary neoplasm can mimic a non-neoplastic lesion, both clinically and radiologically. Although tumor is often the most likely diagnostic consideration in a patient presenting with a contrast-enhancing mass lesion with surrounding edema and mass effect, that is not always the case, there can be significant overlap in the radiologic presentation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases.",

It is, sometimes very difficut for differential and correct diagnosis in these mimicking lesions only on imaging findings. Conclusion: How to escape from misdiagnosis in these mimicking lesions? It is very important to initially first categorize the lesion, such as tumor or nontumorous lesion. It may be as like fastening first button or tee-shot in golf. If we consider clinical information (symptom onset, progression) sufficiently, and then finding imaging clues, sometimes refering to a high-end special study information, we will escape grave misdiagnosis in a large part. Purpose: Intraventricular pilocytic astrocytomas are rare, with only a few case reports in the literature. High grade gliomas (usually glioblastomas) and highly vascularized tumors, such as hemangioblastoma, have been reported to have AV shunting and can mimic high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Presurgical embolization of these tumors is frequently necessary to allow complete resection; however, tumors with high-flow shunts pose a therapeutic challenge and must be managed as high-flow AVMs. Methods: We present a case of an intraventricular low-grade glioma mimicking an arteriovenous malformation, and discuss angiographic findings and strategies for presurgical embolization.",

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed an intratumoral high flow fistula, fed by distal branches of right anterior cerebral artery, draining to the vein of Galen and straight sinus (Fig.1 ). Endovascular embolization of two feeding pedicles of the AV fistula was performed using N-butyl cyanoacrylate. Most afferents were \"en passage\" feeders and, therefore, only a small component of the fistula was embolized. Polyvinil Alcohol (PVA) particles were used to embolize part of the remaining tumor blush, fed by postero-lateral choroidal arteries. A first partial resection was performed via interhemispherical approach, and pathology revealed pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I, World Health Organization (WHO)). Three weeks later, the patient was submitted to a second partial resection, via transcortical approach.",

Conclusion: Precise pre-op measurements of PA verified that MM are smaller tumors than CS along each axis and that smaller tumors achieve GTR more frequently, with its advantages and morbidity. Pre-op radiologic classification of PA significantly predicted GTR, allowing radiologists to advise surgeons on pursuing GTR, altering the goal from achievement of GTR to de-bulking, potentially sparing morbidity. Additionally, patients in which GTR is unlikely could be started on immediate post-surgical therapy to prevent tumor regrowth. Damage of the oligodendrocyts and endothelial cells by radiation leads to vasogenic edema, hypoxia, necrosis and decreasing of the cellularity, at the same time, recurrent tumor contains many neoplastic cells and has an increased cellularity. This morphological specifics can be used to discriminate TR from PRI. The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic value of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in differential diagnosis TR and PRI. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients with proven cerebral rumors after radiation therapy. Entry criteria included new or progressive MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment of brain tumor. The total 55 enhancing lesions were analyzed. The lesions were grouped according to MR enhancement that was due either TR (n=29) or PRI (n=26). Diagnosis was proven histologically in 17 cases after biopsy or surgical resection. Other lesions were considered to be RT or PRI on the basis of MRI and PET with [11C]methionine findings during follow-up period on average 17 months. Conventional MRI (T1, T2, FLAIR, post-gadolinium T1-weighted images) and DWI were performed. The data analysis consisted of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps formation from echo-planar DW images and calculation of the mean ADC values in each enhancing lesion. Regions of interest (ROI) were set manually onto ADC maps in the area corresponding to the enhancing region on the T1-WI. Recurrence and non-recurrence groups were compared by means of Mann-Whitney U test. The level of P<0,05 was set as significant.",

Conclusion: Thus, DWI has low sensitivity in distinction RT from PRI and should be complemented by other MRI functional technics. Result: As previosuly reported, grade tumor cellularity inversely correlates with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. However, there is some overlap between high and low grade tumors according to their ADC values. ADC is also useful to evaluate the therapeutic response and therapy-related tumor changes. MRS results do not differ from previously reported. High Cho/ NAA and Cho/Cr ratios are usually associated with fast growth and high grade, but nevertheless there is no established cutoff because of overlapping between high and low grade tumors.

It is endemically seen in Middle East, Mediterranean countries, Africa, South America and Australia. The disease have a course with the liver and lung involvements. Cranial involvement is relatively rare. Cyst hydatid is generally diagnosed after the radiologic examinations. In this article, the findings of a cranial hydatid cyst initially presented with restricted diffusion that mimics acute infarction is discussed. Methods: Cranial diffusion weighted and contrast enhanced conventional cranial MRI examinations was performed. Result: A 58 year-old female patient was applied to our hospital with the complaint of seizure and weakness in the hands and arms. Diffusionweighted MRI examination was applied due to suspicion of acute infarction. A restricted diffusion was suspected in left cerebellar hemisphere, left occipital lobe and right frontal lobe on diffusion weighted examination suggestiive of acute infarction (Figure 1 a, b) . The follow-up cranial examinations revealed cystic lesions with periferal enhancement in the same areas (Figure 1c, d,e) . Thorax and abdominal computed tomography examinations were performed to rule out other organ involvement. Interatrial septal cystic lesion, renal and splenic cystic lesions were also detected. The cranial hydatid cyst diagnosis was confirmed after surgery with pathologic and serologic evaluation.",

But it can be seen in all areas and the cranial involvement is rarely seen. Hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the cystic lesions of cranium. To our knowledge, our case is the first report of the hydatid cyst disease with initially presented with restricted diffusion. Purpose: A broad spectrum of intracranial cystis lesions can be identified on imaging studies.They can be neoplastic, infectious or non-neoplastic etiology. The purpose of this presentation is to prove that CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive and complementary methods for differential diagnosis of intracranial cystic lesions. Methods: A 79-year-old women presented at emergency department with sudden onset of right side weakness and speech disorders. In past history she has high blood pressure and angina pectoris. Baseline vital signs: only hypertensia. Neurologic status: dysphasia and demaged power of right upper and lower extremities. Neuroradiological imaging included Computed Tomography (CT) examination, which has been made on GE maschine, Bright Speed type. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was done on GE maschine, type SIGNA, 1,5T, using next sequences: T1W/SE without and postcontrast, T1W/SE with fat saturation (T1W/ SEfs), T2*GE and DWI with ADC map in axial plane, T2W/SE in axial and sagital, T2/ FLAIR in coronal and postcontrast T1W/SE in axial plane.",

Small lesions of fat density were in basal cisterns and supratentorial sulci, too. MR imaging confirmed acute cerebral ischemia supraventricular frontal on the left. There was well delineated extraaxial lesion frontobasal, temporobasal and parasellar left, T1/T2 inhomogeneous hyperintense, diameters 23x36x24mm (AP, LL, CC), with restriction of diffusion on DWI and peripheral calcifications on T2*GE. Also, there were fat droplets in basal cisterns and supratentorial sulci. T1W/SEfs confirmed that it was ruptured dermoid cyst. Postcontrast there was no enhancement of lesion, but pial blood vessels were prominent, probably as a part of initial chemical meningitis. Patient was forwarded to a neurosurgeon for further treatment. Conclusion: We presented the patient with neurological symptoms and CT and MRI findings of acute cerebral ischemia, but incidentally we discovered very serious pathology, such as ruptured dermoid cyst. Purpose: To assess the early response changes within tumourous tissue in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) during radiotherapy treatment by use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusibility (MD), axial diffusibility (Dax), and radial diffusibility (Drad). Methods: Eleven patients with GBM underwent the brain MRI exam on 3T MRI unit (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), including DTI scanning. DTI scans were acquired by use of 30 diffusion encoding directions, with 3 b values (0/1000/ 2000 s/mm2), 40 axial slices, and isotropic resolution of 3 mm. The exams were performed before the radiotherapy treatment (control point (CP) 0), after 16 fractions (delivered 28.8Gy) (CP1) and at the end of radiotherapy treatment after delivered 60Gy (CP2). ROIs for DTI measurements were placed at the same position within the solid tumourous tissue in the same patient at all CPs. Average FA, MD, Dax, and Drad values were statistically analyzed and evaluated by Student T-test and Tuckey test with Statistica software package (v.12.0), with the level of confidence determined at p<0.05. Result: Statistically significant differences were observed in FA and Drad average values obtained at CP0 and CP1, with detected decrease of FA (p=0.0294) and increase of Drad at point 1 (p=0.0307). Tuckey test for all measurement at CP0 and CP1 also revealed statistically significant difference (p=0.0296) between FA and Drad average values. Statistic significance has been found for the FA (p=0.0260) and Drad (p=0.0246) average values between CP0 and CP2 as well. Tuckey test in the time interval between CP0 and CP2 confirmed the presence of statistically significant difference in FA and Drad average values (p=0.0261). We have not noticed any significant differences between MD and Dax average values in the examined group of patients between CP0 and neither CP1, nor CP2. Conclusion: Since we found FA and Drad average values responsive to intratumorous tissue changes during the radiotherapy treatment, we are of opinion that it should be considered if and how their further use may potentially contribute to detection of early response tumourous tissue changes to the radiotherapy treatment in GBM patients at the larger group of subjects.",

Patients were required to have either pathology follow-up or at least six-months of clinical and imaging follow-up to assess for accuracy. Only perfusion imaging was evaluated without review of current or prior anatomic imaging. DCE metrics considered were the positive enhancement integral and degree of lesion contrast leakage. DSC metrics evaluated were the negative enhancement integral, relative cerebral blood volume and the percentage of signal recovery. Result: 38 cases were reviewed of which 17 revealed findings of PsP and 21 revealed high grade glial neoplasm. (see tables) DCE performance characteristics were: Sensitivity = 30% ; Specificity = 82.4% ; PPV = 66.7% ; NPV = 48.3%. DSC performance characteristics were Sensitivity = 42.9% ; Specificity = 94.1% ; PPV = 90% ; NPV = 57.1%. A chi-squared analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the two tests (chisquare test = 16.1 ; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Clinical performance of DSC and DCE perfusion imaging showed robust specificity, but poor sensitivity in separating TP from PsP. The performance of DSC was superior although post-processing may not have been optimal and rigorous cutoffs were not required during case evaluation, as is more typical during clinical evaluation. This experience is not at odds with some prior reports about difficulties differentiating PsP from TP versus the higher accuracy of differentiating radiation necrosis from progression.

We investigate the feasibility of DSC in pediatric brain tumor using a lower bolus injection rate (3/4 mL/s), different venous access (arm, foot, hand), with and without sedation, and a standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadolinium (gadobutrol). Methods: Prospective, multicenter study evaluated DSC imaging of 12 consecutive pediatric patients with histologically proven brain tumor, imaged with 1.5T and 3T scanner (GE-EPi sequence, TR 1000-1500ms, TE 45ms, matrix 128\u00d7128, thickness 4 mm, 60 image volumes).

Absolute and relative (to contralateral white matter) values of SUVmax and SUVpeak were determined in new enhancing lesions on MRI. The outcome of PD or TIN was determined by neurosurgical biopsy/resection, follow-up MRI, or clinical deterioration. The association between FDG PET and outcome was analyzed with univariate logistic regression and ROC analysis for: all lesions, lesions >10mm, >15mm, and >20mm. Result: We included 30 patients (5 grade 3 and 25 grade 4), with 39 enhancing lesions on MRI. Twenty-nine lesions represented PD and 10 TIN. Absolute and relative values of SUVmax and SUVpeak showed no significant differences between PD and TIN. ROC analysis showed highest AUCs for relative SUVpeak in all lesion sizes. Relative SUVpeak for lesions >20mm showed reasonable discriminative properties (AUC 0.69 (0.41-0.96)). Purpose: The hemangioblastoma is benign brain tumor, however, it frequently mimics metastatic brain tumor. Diffusion weighted image (DWI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion weighted image (PWI) is often used to differentiate brain tumor. Recently, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is used to evaluate microvascular changes in tumor. The aim of this study was to differentiate hemangioblastoma from metastatic brain tumor using DCE-MRI and compare the diagnostic performance with DWI and PWI. Methods: Between May 2013 and October 2014, DCE-MRI were performed in 7 patients with hemangioblastoma. For comparison, 15 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma with DCE-MRI was selected (total 22 patients, 11 males; ages, 24-79 years; mean, 53 years). Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images including whole enhancing lesions on each slices. DCE-MRI parameters (Ktrans, kep, ve, and vp) were calculated with philips IntelliSpace Portal software (extended Tofts model). ADC, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and DCE-MRI parameters were compared between two groups. The diagnostic performances of each parameters were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We suspected a primary CNS tumor. The patient underwent surgery and the histology was B-cells primary lymphoma. Result: One of the major issues physicians face while dealing with PCNSL, is that it is not a frequent possibility in CNS pathology. There are characteristic imaging features, which may help to raise the suspicion. PCNSL typically involves the supratentorial brain. It predilects the periventricular and superficial regions, often in contact with ventricular or meningeal surface. It can also be deeply seated in the parenchyma, (deep gray nuclei,corpus callosum). Due to its high cellularity, At MR imaging DWI is often restricted and ADC values decreased. But despite these imaging features are characteristic, none of these can unequivocally differentiate CNS lymphoma from other brain lesions. Conclusion: PCNSL is a highly malignant tumor, which requires different approach in diagnosis and management compared to other high-grade malignant brain tumors. Although PCNSL has no pathognomonic imaging features, it often has a characteristic appearance on both CT and MR imaging. New imaging techniques (MRS, PWI and DWI) play important role in the diagnosis of PCNSL and differentiating it from other primary and secondary brain tumors (high-grade gliomas and metastases). This is especially important when the characteristic imaging features on traditional imaging General Hospital, Aosta, ITALY Purpose: Intracranial dermoid cysts are uncommon lesions with characteristic imaging appearances. They arise from a developmental anomaly, in which embryonic ectoderm is trapped in the closing neural tube between the 3th-6th weeks of gestationic. Their presentation is quite variable. Occasionally they are incidental findings, discovered on brain Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) for otherwise unrelated clinical complaints.Often there is a long history of vague symptoms, headache being a prominent feature.They become symptomatic when they comprime adjacent structures or when they rupt. Rupture of an intracranial dermoid is a rare event with considerable associated morbidity and potential mortality. Methods: We describe the case of a 41 years-old woman, occurring at emergency for minor head trauma. She presented with headache, not responsive to therapy and vomiting. CT well defined low attenuating, extra-axial mass, extending from right parasellar region to clivus.Scattered foci of hypodensity were disseminated within the subaracnoid space. MR demonstrated T1-T2 hyperintense lesion, without Gadolinium enhancement, in the middle cranial fossa, intimately associated to the right cavernous sinus and middle cerebral artery.Hypophyseal stalk and optic chiasm were slightly compressed. Scattered foci of T1 high signal intensity, suppressed in T1 fat-sat ,were disseminated throughout the subarachnoid space. CT and MR features were characteristic of a ruptured dermoid. Result: Many intracranial dermoids are asymptomatic, incidentally found. Often there is a long history of vague symptoms, headache being a prominent feature.They may become symptomatic when they comprime adjacent structures or when they rupt: the leakage of sebum into the subarachnoid space may result in an aseptic chemical meningitis.They're often first detected on CT, low attenuation values consistent with fat being suggestive for the diagnosis. MR is the preferred diagnostic procedure, for optimal depiction of the location of the tumor and the involvement of adjacent structures. Fat droplets in the subarachnoid spaces, due to dermoid rupture, are also well detected. Conclusion: Although the imaging appearance of dermoid tumors is characteristic, several intracranial lesions must be considered in the differential diagnosis: epidermoids, teratomas, lipomas, craniopharyngiomas, and occasionally arachnoid cysts. A review of all available CT and MRI images allows the radiologist to offer an accurate preoperative diagnosis. Purpose: Restoring disrupted blood-brain barriers within a glioma due to the effects of bevacizumab (BEV) occasionally leads to false favorable responses (pseudo-response) on magnetic resonance images (MRI) with contrast medium. To clarify the frequency of the pseudoresponses on MRI at the early stage of BEV treatment for glioblastomas, we compared therapeutic responses between MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-methionine (MET). In addition, we determined when MET-PET should be performed to predict prognosis.",

The MET-PET response was defined as the tumor-to-normal brain ratio of a standardized uptake value (SUV) of < 1.6. Therapeutic responses between MRI and MET-PET were compared at each 4 or 8 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) rate was then compared between patients with true-and pseudoresponses at each time point. Result: Frequencies of patients whose MRI was response but MET-PET was not response (pseudo-responders) were 28.6% at 4 weeks and 35.7% at 8 weeks, respectively. Frequencies of patients whose both MRI and MET-PET showed response (true-responders) were 42.9% at 4 weeks and 28.6% at 8 weeks, respectively.

            "text": "Large size (56%), heterogeneity of enhancement with macroscopic necrosis (47%), multiplicity (42%) and invasion of adjacent cranial structures (42%) were the most common radiological findings for these meningiomas. Conclusion: Some radiological features on MRI are very common, but nonspecific, for atypical meningioma. Therefore, presence of these radiological markers can help to predict the diagnosis and recurrence of these tumors and may directly impact their treatment decisions, specially surgical approach. Purpose: Maximal resection and preservation of neurological function are key principles in surgery for brain tumours. Resting state (task-free) functional magnetic resonance (RS-fMRI) has provided a powerful tool for description and investigation of networks underlying neurological functions, by measuring low frequency spontaneous neural activity. The aim of the tis study was to correlate motor, language and vision RS-FMRI networks with neurological dysfunctions. Methods: 67 patients with intra-axial mass lesions were recruited. RS-fMRIs (ICA method) and clinical data in 37 patients with tumors near motor cortex, 23 with tumors near Broca's area and 7 patients with tumors in temporal-occipital region were analyzed for identification of motor, speech and visual networks respectively. Result: Regarding motor function, a strong positive correlation (r=0.65) between ipsilesional motor cortex activation and finger tapping performance was observed in non-paretic patients. Statistically significant differences in motor network activation was also found when paretic patients compared to non-paretics (p<0.01) and when ipsilesional motor network was compared to contralesional one (p<0.01). Regarding speech function, a strong positive correlation (r=0.75) between left inferior frontal gyrus activation and verbal fluency performance was observed in non-aphasic patients. Statistically significant differences in left inferior frontal gyrus activation was also found when aphasic patients were compared to nonaphasics (p<0.01). Regarding, finally, visual function, a statistically significant difference (p<0.01) was found between left and right lingual gyri activation in patients with alexia-an inability to recognize letters. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to validate RS-fMRI motor, speech and visual networks in patients with brain tumors. RS-fMRI is a promising tool for identification of eloquent areas in tumor surgery. Purpose: Leigh syndrome, infantile subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is a genetically heterogeneous, progressive neurodegenerative disease with characteristic bilateral symmetric lesions in basal ganglia and subcortical brain regions. Although many patients used to die without an etiologic diagnosis, a mitochondrial energy metabolism deficiency can frequently be found. Methods: The files of the patients diagnosed with Leigh syndrome during the last 25 years in Hospital Pedi\u00e1trico de Coimbra were retrospectively reviewed, with particular emphasis on the brain imaging.",

All presented in the first 3 years of life, (median age: 16 moths), except a previously healthy boy who had a severe psychotic crisis at the age of 17 years. The most common clinical features were hypotonia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, respiratory rhythm abnormalities, ophthalmoplegia and psychomotor development delay. Diagnosis of a mitochondrial disease was achieved in 12 patients. It was based on molecular findings in 4 patients, 3 with a mtDNA mutation [8993T>G (2) and 14487T>C (1)] and the fourth with a SURF1 mutation (c.868_869insT) and a deletion in heterozigosity. In the others, a severe enzymatic deficiency was found: respiratory chain complex IV (4), complexes I and IV (1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (1), but the molecular studies have so far been inconclusive. Evolution was severe in most patients, with 30% of them deceased in 45 months (7-180) due to brainstem involvement. In two children, CT scan was the only brain imaging available. MRI and proton spectroscopy were performed in 14 patients. T2-weighted spin echo hyperintense lesions were found in the basal ganglia of 86% (symmetric in 60%) and in the brainstem of 64% of the cases. In 5 patients there were lesions in the white-matter, supratentorial (3) or infratentorial (2). The involvement of the subthalamic nucleus was found in the SURF1 deficient patient.

Two PET images were corrected for partial volume effect (PVC) with MRI three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled echo. We also placed the VOIs in 18F-FDG PET images before PVC using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL), and the VOIs were also applied in 11C-PiB and 18F-FDG PET images after PVC. The value of VOIs was corrected for individual differences in uptake by proportional scaling using the cerebellar VOI value (= SUVR).

These structures were T1W hypointense, T2W isointense, T2/STIR highly hyperintense. There was extension of the lesion to the paravertebral soft tissue on the left and to the spinal canal, with consequent minimal compression effects to the dural sack. Also, we detected propagation to the left foramen, with mass effect on left L3 nerve root. This lesion showed intensive postcontrast enchancement, so we suspected that it was metastasis.

Purpose: We propose a mTLICS score for diagnosing and grading thoracolumbar spinal trauma that is based on findings that are more objective and measurable than those used in the current TLICS system. We evaluated the performance of the mTLICS system by measuring the agreement between scores determined by radiologists using both systems and actual treatment procedure delivered. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 134 patients with acute lumbar and thoracic spinal trauma after undergoing MRI. In mTLICS, a compression fracture with height loss less than 50% was scored as one point and more than 50% was scored as two points. A burst fracture with height loss and spinal stenosis less than 50% was two points, and all other burst fractures were assigned three points. For injuries to the posterior ligament complex, the points were subdivided into three categories: an intact PLC was 0 points and definite disruption was three points. If the PLC showed focal enhancement in the soft tissue on enhanced MRI, the injury was scored as one point. If the PLC had an enhancing lesion in the bony structures, it was scored as two points. Interobserver agreements of TLICS and mTLICS scores were analyzed using the kappa statistic. Nonparametric correlation analysis was used to determine correlation among each score and the surgical intervention. Result: The correlation coefficients for total scores based on the TLICS system were moderately correlated, while those from the mTLICS system showed slightly higher correlation. If we consider a total score of 4 to be a negative surgical indication, mTLICS showed higher sensitivities than TLICS, and if we consider a total score of 4 to be a positive surgical indication, mTLICS showed significantly higher specificities than TLICS.

Purpose: To assess the one-year clinical and radiographic outcomes, in terms of pain-relief, bone remodeling of the treatment of Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) involving the spine using a new osteoconductive cement Methods: 6 consecutive patients (4 women and 2 men, mean age 28+/-10.5) were treated with using new osteoconductive bio-active cement (Cerament) for a total of 6 vertebra. All the patients complained of a pain syndrome resistant to medical therapy and all procedures were performed under fluoroscopy control with neuroleptoanalgesia using bipedicular approach. All patients were studied by MR and MDCT and were evaluated with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before treatment and at one and 12 months after the procedure. Result: A successful outcome was observed in 90% of patients, with a complete resolution of pain. Differences in pre and post treatment VAS and ODI at one-year follow-up were significant.No disk and venous leakage were observed.At 1 year follow-up in all patients a bone remodeling of the vertebra was observed. Conclusion: The using of osteoconductive bioactive cement is a good option treatment with normal bone regrowth effect in patient affected by ABC Purpose: To evaluate the faisability and accuracy of vertebral augmentation with Spine Jack system in vertebral fractures older than 1month. Methods: 19 patients with vertebral fracture with important kyphosis (11 cases) and/or intra spinal bone fragments (17 cases) were treated with spine jack expansion device between one month and one year after the fracture. The vertebral augmentation was realized under general anesthesia during a short hospitalisation of 2 days. Result: vertebral augmentation was realized in all cases with a spine Jack followed by PMMA ciment injections (6-9cc) in the vertebral body. A significant reduction of kyphosis( > or = 25%) was obtained in 9/11 patients. Satisfactory stabilization was obtained in all cases. No immediate nor delayed complication occured.

All patients, except one were reviewed at one month with a very good pain relief and improvement of functional disability. Purpose: Spondylolysis and spondylolysthesis are a common cause of low back pain (LBP). Our purpose was to functionally evaluate symptomatic pediatric patients with AL-MRI. Methods: In last 19 months we studied 12 Patients aged 10-18yo. All referred LBP; 7/12 had sporadically sciatic pain in L5 territory. At plain X-ray a spondylolysis was suspected/detected and a spondylolysthesis was present in 10/12. The AL-MRI examinations consisted of basic acquisitions without load followed by the same with the use of the \"Axial Loader\" (at least ALSagT2 and AxialT2) after administration of 50% of body weight; a post-processing allowed cine-loop of the similar images in order to obtain \"functional\" Cine-AL/MRI images of the lumbar spine. Result: All Patients referred the comparison/increment of their symptoms during AL. Spondylolysis was well identified and we observed an increment of the spondylolysthesis (1 to 4 mm) in 10/12 Patients). Always we could evaluate the compression of L5 roots inside the foramina.",

AL-MR,Spondylolysis,Pediatric spine Conclusion: Standing cone beam CT myelography is an excellent adjunct to conventional CT myelography, and can demonstrate posturally dependent changes not seen using conventional technique. Standing myelography is inherently more physiologic than using compression devices in the recumbent position or even upright MRI which is often performed in sitting position; not standing. . They were submitted with low back pain and their MRI were read with at least a 14-day interval between assessments. Radiologists were blinded to clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients and to their colleagues' assessments. Disc degeneration (DD), disc contour abnormalities (DC) and spinal stenosis (SE) were classified following standard criteria. A semiautomatic CAD software was developed with same criteria and tested twice in the same 53 patients by an engineer unaware of previous findings. Fleiss kappa (k) statistic was used to assess intra-and interobserver agreement as well as reliability. From radiologists readings, using a latent class analysis, a final judgment was established on the existence of DD, DCA or SE (two latent classes -2LC-), at different spine level of each subject. Against this judgment the result of software was analyzed. A multiple regression model (MRM) explored how this agreement (kappa) between software-2LC varied with reading moment, location, lesion type and degree of agreement between radiologists. Reliability was defined as agreement between two results of the software test in the same patient. Result: Software reliability ranged from substantial for DD (range, according to location: 0.65-0.81) to perfect for DC and SE (range 0.84-1). The software-2LC agreement followed a pattern similar to the agreement between radiologists: tend to be slight for EE (range 0.04-0.05), between slight and fair in DD (range 0.03-0.33) and between fair and substantial in DC (range 0.11-0.72). The agreement was significantly worse for SE than DC (coefficient in MRM: -0.22), and was influenced directly by the degree of consensus of information from which the classification is constructed (coefficient rater-kappa 0.75 Clinicians were blinded to assessments made by their colleagues and to their own previous readings. No assessment criteria were established before the study. The SINS score agreement was tested by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Fleiss kappa statistic was used to assess intra and inter-observer agreement. Subgroup analyses were performed according to clinicians' specialty, years of experience, and type of hospital. Result: For metastases location inter-observer agreement was \"almost perfect\" at lumbar spine, and substantial at the other levels. Overall agreement with the tumor board classification was \"substantial\" (k=0.71) Inter-observer agreement was almost perfect for the Tomita score and substantial for the Bauer one. Regarding, SINS, inter-observer agreement was \"moderate\" (ICC=0.55). Intra-observer agreement in SINS category was \"substantial\" (k=0.61), while inter-observer was \"moderate\" (k=0.42). Concerning, ESCC inter-observer agreement was \"substantial\" (k=0.63). Although medical oncology scored the lowest agreement (k=0.448), no statistical differences were found with other specialties. In general, results were similar across specialties, years of experience and hospital category. Conclusion: Agreement on the assessment of SINS score is moderate. However agreement in the assessment of other metastatic spine disease scores and location is high. These scores can help improve communication among clinicians in oncology care.

The excessive Glu results in excessive activation of NMDA receptors, triggering various processes resulting in necrotic cell death or apoptosis. The excitotoxicity of Glu has been proposed to underlie the pathogenesis of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To evaluate the neurochemical derangements resulting from synaptic Glu accumulation, we examined astrocyte-specific GLT1 inducible knockout (GLASTCreERT2/+/GLT1flox/flox, iKO) mice brain. Methods: We performed proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS, PRESS; TR/TE/NEX=4000/20/256) of the thalamus and cortex of GLT1 iKO mice (n=2), which exhibit excessive self-grooming (143 and 138 dur-ing10 mins), and wild-type mice (n=5, grooming 6-17 during 10 mins), with a 7.0 tesla magnet (Avance-II, Bruker Biospin). 1H-MRS was quantitatively analyzed using the water scaling method of LCModel, and the concentration is estimated abnormal when it is over or under mean\u00b12SD of wild-type mice. LFB staining and immunohistochemical analysis with anti-GLT1, NeuN, Gfap antibodies were also performed. Result: In the thalamus and cortex of GLT1 iKO mice, 1H-MRS revealed decreased concentration of choline (Cho) , creatine (Cr), and myo-Inositol (mIns) and taurine (Tau), and increased glutamine (Gln) with normal Glu and N-acetylaspartate. GLT1 immunostaining in GLT1 iKO mice showed sparse and weak staining. LFB, GFAP, and NeuN staining showed no difference between GLT1 iKO and wild-type mice. Conclusion: Decreased GLT1 activity results in increased intrasynaptic Glu, which is taken up by astrocytes through GLAST or residual GLT1, and is amidated to a harmless compound, Gln, by Gln synthetase present only in astrocytes. Increased Gln on 1H-MRS may, therefore, result from the increase Gln concentration in astrocytes. Decreased Cho, mIns and Tau may be explained by volume-regulatory release in response to astrocyte Gln accumulation, which is also observed in patients with hepatic encephalopathy or the urea cycle disorders, both having anmonia-induced astrocyte Gln accumulation. , whose AN had been in progress for less than 6 months, drug naive and with no other psychiatric disorders were included in this study. A group of 12 right-handed, age-matched healthy female adolescents (mean age: 15,9; SD 1,8) were studied as control group. All subjects were assessed using structural clinical interviews and a battery of self report questionnaires. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at rest were obtained from all subjects. Functionally relevant resting state networks (RSNs) were identified using independent component analysis (ICA) and a dual regression technique was used to detect between-group differences in the detected RSNs.",

Data was processed with different combinations of smoothing, band-pass filtering, motion correction, mean white matter / mean cerebrospinal fluid /global signal regression, anatomically-derived principal component regression. Data-driven comparison of the different processing pipelines was based on the maximization of derived correlation metrics within subdivisions of the default mode network and the dorsal attention system and a concurrent minimization of correlation metrics between primary motor, visual and auditory cortices. Result: We observed high, albeit non-specific correlations in our networks of interest even without preprocessing, however a proper increase of specific and decrease of non-specific correlations can only be achieved with band-pass filtering and noise-signal regression. We found a saturation of correlation specificity and a decrease in correlation sensitivity above removing >5 principal components, while robust anticorrelated networks also start to appear at the same level of filtering. Despite the tuning, motion regression cannot fully eliminate motion-derived spurious correlations. Conclusion: The optimal pipeline consists of spatial smoothing, bandpass-filtering, motion regression, and the filtering of 5-5 principal components derived from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid compartments. It is possible to tune rs-fMRI processing by concurrently maximizing correlations in connected networks and minimizing correlations between unconnected regions of interest. It is easy to generalize our method to assess other possible processing pipelines. Nevertheless, residual motion-derived signal fluctuations need further investigation. More interestingly, some have symptoms for CM even without enough tonsillar herniation. Thus, cine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow study may be more robust to make a diagnosis of CM. This study, however, is usually performed additionally after obtaining routine brain imaging, and needs longer acquisition time. Three-dimensional T2 sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip-angle evolution (3D T2 SPACE) is very sensitive to CSF bulk motion. We, therefore, hypothesized that this imaging can be used to stratify patients with CM and may find patients without tonsillar herniation but with CSF flow disturbances at the foramen magnum.",

Conclusion: Localized brain cooling can inhibit the increase in BBB permeability that follows transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in an animal model. had the shortest ATT. Conversely, ABZ and PBZ showed the lowest CBF and the longest ATT. In MCA territory, absolute CBF values were not correlated with CAS severity. However, the ATT in the MCA territory ipsilateral to CAS was longer than in the contralateral side, and the ATT ratio ( ipsi-/contralateral) was significantly higher in patients with >90% stenosis compared to those with a <70% CAS. ABZ and PBZ angles in the hemisphere ipsilateral to CAS were larger than in the contralateral hemisphere, and significantly correlated with the stenosis degree. Conclusion: Downstream territories in CAS show longer ATT and larger borderzone angles, increasing with the stenosis severity. This suggests an increased territory at risk of heamodynamic stroke in patients with CAS, despite preserved CBF possibly through autoregulation and collateralisation. Purpose: Brain temperatures (BT), which mainly depends on the imbalance obeying the heat removal theory, can change abnormally in hemodynamic impairment diseases such as Moyamoya disease and stroke patients. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoned patients can also show the imbalance between cerebral perfusion and metabolism in the early phase after CO exposure. Cerebral white matter (CWM) damage, which reduces the brain metabolism, was observed in CO-poisoned patients, BT may thus depend on the extent of damage. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), which are quantitative parameters calculated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) dataset, are used for assessing BT and the extent of CWM damage, respectively. Here, we investigated whether relationship BT and CWM damage in the subacute CO-poisoned patients can be assessed using only DTI. Purpose: There are increasing reports of cognitive and psychological declines related to occupational stress in subjects without psychiatric premorbidity or major life trauma.The underlying neurobiology is unknown.The aim of our study is the evaluation of cerebral volumetric and cognitive function abnormalities in patients with chronic occupational work related stress to identify a pattern of volumetric and psychological alterations which could characterize this disorder. Methods: We have submitted to our study 20 patients who have accessed to the center of Work Related Psychopathology. An assessment protocol lasting at least six months was administered to the patients in which clinical, psychopathological and working dimensions were examined.The psychopathological dimensions were measured through the use of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), the Hamilton Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). The perception of the occupational stress was assessed by administering the Work Distress (nQ-WD).The patients were divided through these criteria into two groups: with an high pathogenesis working (group A) and with a moderate or poor working pathogenesis (group B). We have included a group of 15 subjects adjusted for sex, age and schooling as a control sample (6 F, 9 M) without any history of psychological and / or significant mental disorders.We administered the same neuropsychological tests to al subjects , represented by MMSE, FAB, BICAMS battery in order to assess their cognitive function especially in the memory domain. We investigated the volumetry in stressed subjects and unstressed controls using the international harmonized protocol developed for the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on MR images,SIEANAX and VBM analyses. Result: The stressed subjects showed a bilateral reduction in the hippocampal volume, especially in the left hippocampus(p<0.05). No significant correlations was found with the neuropsychological data Conclusion: The present study expands upon the data from animal experiments and reports from PTSD patients, and focuses on the involvement of the hippocampus in chronic stress. The finding of atrophy in regions known to be associated with chronic psychosocial stress confirms our previous conclusion that subjects reporting stereotyped symptoms from occupational stress have a medical condition requiring careful investigations and a targeted treatment. Methods: Sixty-three RRMS were enrolled in the study and classified as fatigued (F-RRMS; FSS score > 45; N=33) and non-fatigued (NF-RRMS; FSS score < 36; N=30). Thirty-one age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were used as control group. All subjects underwent a 3T MRI including conventional and DTI sequences. Gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes were estimated using SIENAX software. WM focal lesions were identified and lesion volume (LV) and Lesion Probability Maps (LPM) were computed. The microscopic NAWM damage was explored by Tract Based Spatial Statistic (TBSS) analysis, using LPM to exclude voxels were WM lesion frequency was higher than 5%. Result: F-RRMS and NF-RRMS showed no significant differences in age, gender, disease duration, disability, LV and normalized GM/WM volumes.DTI-derived metrics of the NAWM skeleton were significantly and diffusely altered when comparing RRMS with HC. A widespread FA reduction and MD increase was found in the NAWM of F-RRMS when compared to NF-RRMS. These findings mostly located at the level of thalamus and WM tracts connected to motor/pre-motor cortices, predominantly in the right hemisphere. In the correlation analysis a significant relationship was found between DTI-derived measures of the NAWM skeleton, particularly in fronto-parieto-insular regions, and FSS scores. Conclusion: A widespread microstructural NAWM damage, especially located in the right WM tracts connected to motor/pre-motor cortex and thalamus, might be a critical factor in determining fatigue in RRMS patients. The relevance of such finding is further emphasized by the lack of significant differences in GM/WM atrophy and LV between F-RRMS and NF-RRMS. Recently emphasis has been placed on the use of analysis of eigenvalues (\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3) that are elements of the DTI to access brain development. In particular, the concept of RD has gained importance, that is as a measure of microscopic water motion perpendicular to the direction of axons. components correspond to areas of increase in isotropic (blue) and extraneurite (red) diffusion components, respectively. The information added might be helpful to guide biopsy sampling and treatment planning. Moreover, NODDI color map seems to distinguish specific patterns of diffusion compartment redistribution in case of acute ischemic stroke or hyperosmolarity injury, both characterized by restricted diffusivity on conventional diffusion weighted imaging. Conclusion: NODDI color maps represent a feasible and useful way to visualize the information provided by NODDI analysis in a practical single image summarizing brain microstructural complexity in normal appearing white matter as well as in brain pathology. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to present a protocol developed for the surgical management of lesions located in left premotor region, where fMRI and tractography-integrated navigation are used in conjunction with direct electrical stimulations (DES). Methods: A multidisciplinary team composed of neuropsychologists, neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists agreed a protocol for easy preoperative handling of patients with lesions in left prefrontal region. All imaging is performed by using a 1.5-T (Philip, Intera). We studied 18 patients: 10 high-grade glioma, 5 low-grade glioma and 3 arteriovenous malformations. The protocol consists of three paradigms' blocks (2 motor and 1 linguistic), 3D image anatomic T2 or T1 depending on the type of lesion and DTI (16 diffusion gradient directions.) DTI and fMRI data are used in joint analysis, the results of analyzing different modalities are derived separately and then are combined together to perform statistical analysis with de Philips's workstation. The results are validated with intraoperative procedures. Result: In an attempt to develop an optimized and standardized protocol, fMRI examinations have been integrated into routine presurgical planning in our hospital. Complex finger opposition of the right hand alternating with rest paradigm generates a strong activation of cortical motor network in both hemispheres (primary sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex and proper supplementary motor area). Complex finger opposition of the right hand vs left hand identifies primary motor cortex. The verbal fluency-verb generation paradigm that is complementary to the former one, allow us to identify presupplementary motor area, generally involved in linguistic planning, in addition to classic Broca and Wernicke area and cortex premotor. To be able to compare the sequences with standard protocol sequences the contrastenhanced GRASP sequence was additionally acquired in patients with suspicion of tumors and vascular pathologies. Two neuroradiologists analysed the GRASP images and compared them to sequences used in the standard protocols (T1w post contrast, 4D MRA) with respect to delineation of pathologies and artifacts. Result: 25 patients were examined with the GRASP sequence. No pathology was observed in 8 patients. The other 17 patients had the following reports: glioblastoma (1x), meningeoma (4x; Fig. 1 ), arteriovenous malformation (1x), aneurysm (1x), pituitary adenoma (2x); pleomorphic adenoma (3x), glomus jugulare paraganglioma (2x), cavernous hemangioma (2x), squamous cell carcinoma (1x). In the contrastenhanced GRASP sequence arrival of contrast media and distribution over time was well visible in all patients with additional high regional resolution. All pathologies could be evaluated in detail. Pulsation artefacts were not observed. The image quality was still quite good when the patient moved during acquisition. Furthermore having variable temporal sampling during retrospective reconstruction was a benefit. The arterial phase was not missed because it could be reconstructed by choosing a different reconstruction pattern from the continuously acquired data.",

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps provided by ASL can also be helpful in the post-treatment evaluation. Besides neoplastic lesions, the functional information from ASL may aid in the diagnosis of other conditions like stroke, brain atrophy and microangiopathic brain lesions. Epliptic patients may show both hyperperfusion patterns during crises and in the postictal state and hipoperfusion pattern in the interictal phase. Vascular malformations like brain AVMs and proliferative angiopathy may also be evaluated by this technic. Congenital diseases like Dyke-Davidoff-Mason show an diffusely hipoperfunded brain hemisphere. ASL information can also aid in pseudotumoral demyelinizating lesion, by showing an hypoperfusion pattern. Metabolic conditions like adrenoleucodistrophy can also be evaluated with CBF information provided by ASL. Conclusion: ASL is a technic that provide functional information about the cerebral perfusion without the need for contrast media injection. It can be easily applied to an MRI examination, and can help the radiologist in many situations, from tumoral conditions to stroke and epilepsy. Hence, its important for all radiologist be familiar with this technic and its capabilities. Methods: For each voxel (V) in the cortex, extracted from automatically segmented T1-weighted images (voxel size = 1 mm3), we computed two fractal geometry related properties by counting the number of boxes needed to cover a growing neighborhood of V up to a size r-max (parameter of the algorithm). With a linear regression we derived FD (slope) and Q (intercept). We tested our method on 19 healthy controls (12 males, mean age 9.65)(HC) and 9 patients affected by various MCDs (3 males, mean age 7.82). FD and Q maps were moved to a study-specific template built from the normal gray matter (GM). We computed the global norm one distance of the normalized histogram of each subject from the reference histogram built from HC. FD around V was modeled as normally distributed, then the local distance was computed as the norm one between the probability distribution functions of S and that of HC. Voxel V was finally classified as healthy or abnormal when one of the two distances exceeded the thresholds \u03c7l, and \u03c7h, tunable parameters of the algorithm. Result: HCs and patients showed a significant difference of FD (2.416 \u00b10.007 for the HCs, 2.386 \u00b1 0.019 for PATs, p=1.44E-5) and Q (2.386 \u00b10.019 for the HCs, 2.827\u00b10.059 for patients, p=9.21E-5) values and of shape distribution between normal and malformed areas (Fig.1) . With a leave-one-out approach, we tuned the parameters \u03c7l and \u03c7h on the HC to maximize the accuracy of lesions' detection and to minimize the false positive rate. The best set of parameters reached an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 83%, 85% and 80% respectively. The area under the curve was 0.88. Conclusion: The proposed method was able to discriminate between normal cortex and malformed areas in a wide spectrum of MCDs, ranging from polymicrogyria to pachygyria. The method, appropriately tuned on a single-subject level, could help neuroradiologists in the detection of small MCD, improving the diagnostic accuracy of MRI. Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the ability of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the characterization of microstructure of different brain regions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in healthy volunteers without any neurological pathology. Methods: 20 patients with MS and 5 healthy volunteers (mean age 35\u00b19 and 32 years old respectively) underwent DKI measurements with a 3T MR-scanner, using b-values equal 0, 1000 and 2500 s/mm\u00b2 and 60 gradient directions.

Purpose: MPS IVa is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-sulfatase. Main symptom is systemic skeletal dysplasia. Affection of the vascular system has not been described yet. Goal of this study is the analysis of the vascular system in patients with MPS IVa, based on the example of the aorta. Methods: In a retrospective study, 32 patients with MPS IVa aged 10-49 years (\u03bc 22, 5; m 21) were included. All patients were of small stature (length 106 \u00b119 cm).The aorta in its course from 4th thoracic vertebrae to 10th was analyzed on the basis of 49 craniospinal axial plane MR and 4 axial plane CT examinations. To describe the course of the aorta, we divided the area around the vertebral body into 5 equal parts, each at an angle of 36\u00b0. Therefore, we connected the processi transversi with a straight line and numbered the segments from right (segment 1) to left (segment 5). High buckled arteries in relation to the length of the affected aortal part were indicated as aortal kinking, and a moderate twist in relation to the length of the affected aortal part as aortal coiling. Result: 12 of 32 patients had an aortal kinking, 10 of 32 patients an aortal coiling, 4 of these had moderate and 3 strongly coiled aortae. 7 patients had a normal aortal course, 4 couldn't be analyzed. One patient revealed both, aortal kinking and coiling. Conclusion: This study reveals for the first time the occurrence of aortic tortuosity in patients with MPS IVa. Although the etiology is still unknown, we suggest, that this complication could be due to glycosaminoglycane deposition in the aortic intima respectively media, which may be associated with an increased vulnerability of the vascular wall and a rupture of the elastic fibers. Therefore, we conclude that the examination of the vascular system should be included in regular followup protocols of MPS IVa patients.

Repeated scans at 6 months post injury (chronic) were performed for all subjects. The DTI dataset was post-processed by MRIConvert, FSL and AFNI. Median fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured in middle cerebellar peduncles, corona radiata, anterior and posterior limbs of internal capsule, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum using ICBM DTI-81 atlas as a template. Result: At acute stage significantly higher MD involving corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, cingulum and posterior thalamic radiation tracts with no significant FA changes in both mild-uncomplicated and mild-complicated TBI patients compared to healthy control . At 6 months, FA of mild-complicated TBI patients was significantly reduced in the corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule and splenium of corpus callosum; with increased MD of corona radiata, cingulum of the corono radiata and posterior thalamic radiation compared to healthy control. Longitudinal changes of lower FA were seen in within both complicated and uncomplicated mTBI WM tracts while longitudinal changes in MD were not signficant ( Purpose: To assess the prevalence of white matter injury and intraventricular/germinal matrix hemorrhage in very preterm (VPT) born neonates (<32/40 weeks gestation) and its impact on visual-motor outcomes. Methods: Eighty-six VPT neonates (46 males; mean age at birth: 28.9 weeks; range 24.7-32.9) underwent MRI scanning within 2 weeks of birth and were assessed for the presence and grade of germinal matrix/ intraventricular hemorrhage and white matter lesions to comprise three groups: no injury (morphologically normal MRI), mild/moderate injury (isolated, linearly punctate white matter lesions with or without IVH/ GMH grades 1 to 3), and severe injury (confluent punctate white matter lesions and/or PVHI/GMH grade 4). At 2 and 4 years of age, a subset of children underwent neuropsychological assessments to evaluate motor and visual-motor abilities. At 2 years, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3rd edition was performed to yield a standard score of motor ability. At 4 years, the Beery-Buktenica Visual-Motor Integration 6th edition was performed to yield standard scores of visual-motor integration, motor coordination and visual perception skills. The impact of each brain injury group on visual-motor outcome measures was determined by performing analyses of covariance, adjusting for sex and gestational age.",

At 2 and 4 years of age, 41 and 44 children returned for neuropsychological assessments. At 2 years, no group differences were found between Bayley motor scores and the three injury groups (p > 0.05) although 10 children scored below average. At 4 years, again no group differences were found between visual motor integration, visual perception and motor coordination scores (p > 0.05) although 15 and 26 children experienced below average visual perception and motor coordination scores, respectively. Conclusion: In our longitudinal cohort of VPT children, no differences were found between brain injury groups and visual-motor outcome measures at 2 and 4 years of age. As functional impairments have been shown to arise from early brain injury, this finding indicates a mechanism for compensatory neuroplasticity in our population.",

Diffusion weighted images showed mild increase in intensity of these areas but there were no diffusion restriction. There were increased T2 signals expanding the dural sheath of the bilateral optic nerve and bilateral papillae protrude into the vitreous space of the globe because of increased intracranial pressure. After administering intravenous (IV) contrast, thickening and enhancement was seen in bilateral optic nerves, optic tractus, bilateral 3rd and 5th cranial nerves, 7th and 8th cranial nerves. In thoracal and lomber MRI, there were increased T2 signals and enhancement in spinal cord. Enhancement was seen in all nerve roots in neural foramina and around nerve roots. Also thickening and enhancement of cauda equina fibers was present. There were soft tissue thickening in paravertebral spaces. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was consistent with CSF involvement of CML. Patient was diagnosed with isolated central nervous system blast crisis and treated with IV pulse steroid and intrathecal methotrexat, cytarabine and dexamethasone. Control MRI showed that earlier findings were disappeared and there were no pathological findings. Conclusion: There are cases of isolated optic nevre infiltration which caused vision loss but a case like ours, involvement of all cranial nerves and spinal nevre roots is defined for the first time in literature. Purpose: Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare genetic disease of childhood that affects both the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Axonal loss with several giant axons filled with neurofilaments is the main histopathological feature of peripheral nerve biopsies in this disease. Methods: Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed with 1.5T MR system (Siemens Magnetom Avanto, Erlangen, Germany). We present MRI and MRS findings of the patient. Result: A 10-year-old boy had delayed motor and mental milestones, weakness and wasting of distal muscles of upper and lower limbs, progressive clumsiness of gait and progressive decline in cognitive functions with dullness. He also presented with progressive walking difficulty and recurrent falls. Evaluation showed frizzy hair, dry skin, characteristic facies, sensory motor neuropathy, and ataxia. Performed MRI showed bilateral symmetric white matter signal changes in the dentat nucleus of cerebellum. On proton MRS, an increase in choline(Cho) /creatine(Cr) ratios, a reduction in the N-acetyl aspartate(NAA)/Cr ratio, and the presence of lactate and myo-inositol peak were observed (Figure 1 ). Figure. In MRI, axial T1-weighted (a), axial T2-weighted (b), coronal FLAIR (c) images showed bilateral symmetric white matter signal changes in the dentat nucleus of cerebellum (arrows). On proton MRS (d), an increase in Cho/Cr ratios, a reduction in the NAA/Cr ratio, and the presence of lactate and myo-inositol peak are observed. Conclusion: GAN is a rare, genetic, progressively fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by mental retardation, progressive sensory motor neuropathy and CNS involvement. Histopathologically, enlarged axons with accumulation of neurofilaments, astrocytic degeneration, demyelination and the presence of Rosenthal fibers are characteristic features of this disease. The reported imaging findings on MRI include involvement of cerebellar and cerebral white matter with sparing of the subcortical U-fibers, a variable degree of cerebral atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. In MRS, mostly expected findings are decreased NAA, increased Cho/Cr and increased lactate and myoinositol in white matter. In conclusion, GAN is a chronic disease with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Although it is a well-known disease among adults, it is our aim to report our experience in pediatric patients and to highlight the value of MRI findings in the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Methods: From january 2010 until december 2014, 8 patients (5 girls and 3 boys) aged from 1 to 9 years old had a diagnosis of PRES based on clinical and MRI findings. All of them had underlying diseases for which they were receiving drug treatments. 4 patients were under inmunosupressive drugs after hepatic translplant, 2 were receiving treatment for Acute Linphatic Leukemia, one patient had a neuroblastoma and another one had hemodynamic compromise after a systemic infection. Result: All patients showed the characteristic hyperintense T2 and FLAIR lesions in subcortical white matter depicting vasogenic edema.",

Both posterior and anterior circulation territories were involved in 80 % of patients with predilection for posterior areas whereas 20 % showed only posterior compromise._ Conclusion: PRES is an increasingly recognized clinicoradiological syndrome among pediatric patients and it is frequently associated with multiple clinical and toxic disorders. As neuroradiological findings are often characteristic, MRI has become an important clue in the diagnosis. MRI diffusion weighted sequences are useful in the diagnosis as well as in giving prognostic information concerning the outcome in each patient._ The prompt recognition of MRI findings has important prognostic implications because the reversibility of the lesions is contingent on early treatment. Parkinson's disease produces neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN) , basal ganglia(BSG) and subcortical gray in the human forebrain.Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) has been previously performed in Parkinson's disease(PD) to evaluate in vivo concentrations of basal ganglia (BSG)and cerebral cortex metabolites.However, this technique has never been used to evaluate the substantia nigra (SN)in PD patients. In this study ,single voxel MRS of BSG and SN was performed in PD and normal control (non PD) to evaluate the usage of MRS in PD patients Methods: Material and method: 17 PD patients (12 men,5 women, mean age 60.5(SD9.4),mean duration of the disease 5.9 yrs(SD4.2 ) ,Hoehn&Yahr stage I-III An additional 14 healthy age-matched controls, including 8 men and 6 women of mean age 55.5 yrs(SD5.8)were enrolled . Patients with evidence of brain atrophy and cognitive impairment were excluded. Result: Results: A significant reduction in the NAA/Cr ratio was observed in the SN of PD compared with controls(P<0.05).BSG spectra did not allow any evaluation due to the presence of artifacts related to inorganic paramagnetic substances. Purpose: The aim of the exhibition is to review the currently used and widely accepted visual grading and scoring systems for magnetic resonance (MR) image of the brain in dementia work-up. In addition, we present the visual atlas of structural changes of brain in variable cause of dementia. Methods: We investigated various visual scores and scales for MR imaging of brain as a part of evaluation of dementia. Among them we compiled a list of currently used and generally accepted scores and scales. Then the atlas of those visual scores and scales for dementia was composed of MR images of patients with variable causes of dementia in our institute. Also, we displayed characteristic MR findings in individuals with different diagnosis of dementia.",

Purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the relationship between clinical and immunoserological characteristics and brain MRI findings in patients presenting with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Patients with SLE underwent brain MRI due to neuropsychiatric symptoms and a total of 93 patients were enrolled after exclusion of negative MRI results. Positive results of brain MRI were divided as follows; atrophy, infarction, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), vasculitis and meningitis. Clinical charactersistics (age of SLE onset, disease duration, nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), thrombocytopenia) and immunoserological markers (anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody, C3 and C4) were correlated with brain MRI results",

Purpose: Acute viral encephalitis syndrome (AES) is commonly seen among hospitalized patients. But radiologic imaging is relatively liitle is reported on nonherpetic encephalitis, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) accounts for approximately one-quarter of cases. Although poor prognostic features for JE have been identified, and guide management, relatively little is reported on the remaining three-quarters of AES cases.So, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the characteristic radiologic findings of nonherpetic viral encephalitis , and to compare diagnostic performance between DWI and conventional MR. Methods: Patient with VE (n = 14) were identified through admission records (22 males; median age, 56 years; age range, 8-79 years) between 2010 and 2015. Nonherpetic VE was defined by fulfilling the clinical acute encephalitis symptoms and having a discharge diagnosis of suspicious viral encephalitis, supported by a CSF cell count <1000 cells/mm3 with a lymphocyte predominance and no positive identification of non-viral pathogens in the CSF or blood. AES patients with suspected viral etiology were classified, based on positive IgM antibody in serum or cerebral spinal fluid, as japanese encephalitis (n = 2), EBV (n=1), Mumps ( n=1), and VZV ( n=1) unknown viral aetiology (n = 9). MR imaging in 14 retrospectively identified patients was evaluated for the imaging patterns and MR scoring according to the involved or predominmant sites .

Methods: 15 RRMS patients (mean age 32y), 15 SPMS patients (mean age 43 y) and 13 healthy controls () underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT-perfusion with iodine contrast. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to assess thalamus volume in all patients. And CT-perfusion was made to evaluate CBF, CBV, MTT measures. Quantitative results were compared (T-test, Mann-Whitney U test). Result: RRMS, SPMS patients experienced significantly higher thalamus atrophy (p<0.05) compared to healthy controls, but there was no significant difference between both types of MS. Redused perfusion (CBF, CBV) was also observed in MS patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05) in both thalamus. There were no correlations between blood flow and thalamus volume in any of groups. Conclusion: This study shows that deep grey matter atrophy is more pronounced in SPMS and RRMS patients than in healthy controls, and it is closely connected with cerebral blood perfusion. To understand what is primary, redused perfusion or atrophy, further studies are still needed.",

Result: Brain MRI showed bilateral symmetric areas of high signal on T1W, isointense on T2W in globus palidus, head and body of caudate nuclei, putamen, thalami, dentate nuclei, corona radiata and subcortical white matter. T2W GRE magnetic resonance images demonstrated in the same areas low signal. That were calcifications, which were confirmed on CT scan. The whole white matter, were T2W/FLAIR/DWI hyperintense, but may not be related to calcifications. That reflected slowly progressive metabolic brain process.

This change of oculomotor nerve was prominently noted at the inferior division of intraorbital segment, orbital apex and cavernous sinus regions. These patients had risk factors of ischemic neuritis such as diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia or hypertension. All of them were treated with aspirin and steroid and partial or complete recovered oculomotor palsy. Result: Leptomeningeal enhancement with small granulomas were present in 15 patients (88,2%; M:F; 5:10); 12 of them had leptomeningeal form in combination with cranial nerves involvement: in 11 cases optic nerve and chiasm; in 3 cases facial nerve were affected, infudibular involvement was in 6 cases; Robin-Virchow spaces of basal ganglia in 3 cases. Five patients (29,4%; M:F; 0:5) had dural involvement, 4 of them in combination with leptomeningeal granulomas; 2 with parenchymal foci. 8 patients (47%; M:F; 3:5) had non-enhancing parenchymal lesions. Simultaneous dural, parenchymal and leptomeningeal involvement was in one case. Most common neurological symptoms in patients with leptomeningeal involvement were headache (53, 3%), dizziness (40%). Cranial neuropathies correlated with MRI in 30%. Patients with leptomeningeal and parenchymal lesions did not have age or gender prevalence.

Methods: The study consisted of 10 children with DS (age 2.6\u00b10.69) and 8 healty controls (2.5\u00b10.707). DTI images evaluated with a whole brain voxelwise analysis using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) and subsequently with a complementary atlas-based, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and MD values were obtained for right cerebral pedicul (cp), bilateral anterior limb of internal capsul (alic), bilateral inferior frontooccipital(ifo) fasciculus (fas) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ilf), bilateral minor forceps of corpus callosum (CC), bilateral cingulum ( Purpose: Cerebral iron deposition plays a key role in pathophysiology of neurodegenerative processes. Iron concentrations are elevated in cortical and basal ganglia regions in Alzheimer Disease (AD), indicating a disruption of its homeostasis. Higher iron concentrations in AD may increase the possibility of free iron catalyzing lipid peroxidation leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation of brain iron deposition with the severity of white matter microvascular damage evaluated by means of cerebral perfusion in mild-AD patients. Methods: 18 mild-AD patients evaluated by means of neuropsychological tests were enrolled in the study and compared with 18 aged matched healthy volunteers. Iron concentration was derived from R2* measurements obtained with multi-echo gradient echo sequences (1 mm in-plane resolution, slice thickness 4 mm; TR= 68 ms; TE1=4.9 ms, delta TE = 4.9 ms, 12 echoes) and data were collected from 14 ROI in cortical and subcortical grey matter. Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) was obtained by means of a pseudocontinuous Arterial Spin Labeling (pCASL) sequence (T2* EPI; TR/TE = 4000/11 ms, 3.5x3.5x6 mm3 resolution; label duration = 1650 ms, post label delay = 1600 ms, background suppression pulses). Vascular damage was also evaluated on conventional images according to Fazekas scale. Result: R2* shows a significant correlation with the severity of white matter microvascular damage in the right frontal cortex (p>0.05) and with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; p<0.02) in the left frontal cortex in mild AD group compared to controls. CBF modifications in mild-AD patients shows no significant correlation with MMSE and a significant correlation with vascular damage (p<0.05) in the left lateral orbito-frontal cortex. Moreover a significant decreased CBF was observed in bilateral nucleus caudatus in mild-AD group (p<0,05) compared to controls. Conclusion: Iron concentration positively correlates with the severity of microvascular white matter damage and negatively correlates with CBF in mild-AD patients, indicating that it may be used as biomarkers to evaluate the progression of AD. Quantification of brain metal content and distribution may be a predictive marker for early diagnosis, assessment of treatment strategies or therapeutic target in AD. generated for a ROI-based analysis using the software suite (www.mristudio.org, Johns Hopkins University; JHU) under an IRB protocol. Two neuroradiologists independently scored brain regions as having hyperintense signal or normal signal intensity. The parcellation process consisted of (1) skull-stripping of T2WI utilizing ROI Editor, (2) a normalization process in which skull-stripped images were re-sampled to the same image dimensions as the JHU-MNI \"Eve\" single subject atlas using DiffeoMap, (3) linear transformation of the patient T2WI using the JHU-MNI T2WI as our subject utilizing an atlas to subject transformation, (4) non-linear transformation using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping applied to the White Matter Parcellation Map type II, which produced a parcellation map of 130 ROIs for each brain. Readers used a binary score of either normal or abnormal for each brain region. Inter-rater reliability was measured as the percent of the 130 regions on which the readers agreed that a specific region was either normal or abnormal. Result: Overall, the percent agreement for all 62 subjects was 75%. In this preliminary study, the most common regions on which the readers agreed as having abnormal signal intensity were in the corticospinal tract, deep white matter, cerebellar white matter, deep gray matter, and posterior corpus callosum. Conclusion: Inter-reader agreement for classifying brain regions based on an automated parcellation program was generally good. Further evaluation using a larger number of readers is presently being performed to validate exact regions of brain involvement in Krabbe disease. Purpose: Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common autoimmune disease in humans frequently leading to hypothyroidism. It has been reported that among patients with hypothyroidism receiving biochemically adequate treatment, well-being and cognition performance remain reduced. The aim of the study was to evaluate metabolic changes within the normal appearing brain in patients with Hashimoto disease using MR spectroscopy (MRS) and to correlate MRS measurements with clinical data. Methods: Fifty-five patients with Hashimoto disease (HD) without central nervous system involvement (mean age 43.5yrs) and 30 healthy controls (mean age 42.5yrs) were enrolled in the study. The patients with HD were in the euthyreosis phase (normal TSH level), and were treated with levothyroxine. Only those patients and control subjects who had normal signal intensity of the grey and white matter without evidence of cerebral atrophy were included in our study. The MRS examinations were performed on a 1.5T scanner. Voxels were located in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and the left parietal white matter (PWM). The NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and mI/Cr ratios were analyzed. The metabolite ratios and hormonal concentrations (TSH, fT3, fT4) as well as anti-TG and anti-TPO levels were also correlated.",

            "text": "Conclusion: The reduction of NAA/Cr ratios may suggest loss of neuronal activity within normal appearing gray and white matters in patients with Hashimoto disease. MRS could be a sensitive marker of early cerebral metabolic disturbances associated with Hashimoto disease. Our findings suggest that there is a biological link between thyroid dysfunction and cerebral metabolic changes. To the best of our knowledge, this study showing metabolic changes in patients with HD using MRS examinations is the first report in world literature. Purpose: To determine the incidence of brain microbleeds in patients with non-hemorrhagic stroke, their relationship with white matter disease and lacunae, their value as a predictor of new stroke events and their relationship with type of antithrombotic treatment Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 435 unselected consecutive patients with ischemic stroke in our Neurology Unit from January 2013 to May 2014. We excluded all patients without an MRI or with a nondiagnostic MRI due to non-sufficient quality and/or without 2D GRE T2*-weighted images. 258 patients had a diagnostic MRI with GRE T2* sequences. Microbleeds were defined as rounded well-delimited hypointense lesions up to one centimeter in size located within the brain parenchyma. Three independent radiologists classified the number and location of microbleeds, with the anatomical sites being the posterior fossa, deep grey matter and cerebral lobes. The findings were correlated with previous clinical ischemic events and type of treatment (antiplatelet or anticoagulant). Result: The overall incidence of microbleeds in patients with nonhemorrhagic stroke was 24.6%. The incidence of leucoaraiosis and lacunae in microbleed patients was 79% and 77.4%, respectively. In the nonmicrobleed group the respective incidence was 62.1% and 66.8%. A previous clinical ischemic event had been experienced by 31% of the microbleed patients but only 17% of the non-microbleed patients. Antiplatelet therapy had been received by 34% of the microbleed patients and 29% of the non-microbleed patients. However, anticoagulant therapy had been received by 11% of the microbleed patients whereas only 4% of the non-microbleed patients had received anticoagulant therapy Conclusion: Cerebral microbleeds are a biomarker of the incidence and recurrence of ischemic stroke and can play a role in treatment decisions about antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy Purpose: To describe the pattern of white matter (WM) injury in motor and non-motor brain areas in a group of children with cerebral palsy (CP) due to periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), by means of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and to correlate the damage with cognitive and clinical features.",

Methods: Sixty-one patients with mTBI (mean age= 27.08, SD 8.55) underwent scanning at an average of 10 hours (SD 4.26) post trauma along with assessment of their neuropsychological performance at an average of 4.35 hours (SD 7.08) upon full Glasgow Coma Scale recovery. Results were then compared to 19 healthy control participants (mean age= 29.05, SD 5.84) both in the acute stage and 6 months post trauma. Both ICBM-81 Atlas Based Region of Interest (ROI) and Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) methods were used. Result: The DTI and neuropsychological measures between acute and chronic phases were compared and significant differences emerged. Specifically, chronic phase FA and RD values showed significant group differences in the corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, and genu of corpus callosum. Findings also demonstrated associations between DTI indices and neuropsychological outcome across two time points. Conclusion: Our results provide new evidence for the use of DTI as an imaging biomarker and indicator of white matter damage occurring in the context of mTBI, and they underscore the dynamic nature of brain injury and possible biologic basis of chronic neurocognitive alterations. Besides that, our current results also offers better characterisation of the pathogenic cellular processes occurring both in acute and chronic phase.

Many patients with acute neurological deficit are wrongly hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute stroke. The role of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the non-invasive medical tests is to make us aware of the imaging features which aid in the correct diagnosis. Methods: We present two female patients aged 63 and 83 with acute changes in personality, abnormal movements, suspected of cerebral strokes.

Result: MDCT in the first patient show cortical atrophy and in the second patient cortical atrophy with incipient leucoencephalopathy. The MRI examinations detected abnormal signal intensity / hyperintensities in the cortex, basal ganglia on FLAIR, T2-weighted images , DWI, without postcontrast enhancement in T1W SE. Electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a specific type of abnormality in CJD. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not demonstrate signs of infection .

Result: Six patients had anterior circulation infarctions: 4 patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion had infarcts involving the MCA territory, and 2 patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion had infarction in MCA/ACA territory and MCA plus internal white matter watershed infarcts. The other 4 patients had posterior circulation infarcts from basilar artery occlusion. In the 4 patients with basilar artery occlusion, clot was visualised on NECT/CTA in one patient. 2 cases with ICA involvement had long segment occlusion. In the 4 patients with MCA occlusion, the thrombus was visualized in all patients on NECT/CTA and on GRE but not on TOF-MRA.

In 40 pre-treatment and 25 post-treatment glioma patients, the APT asymmetric values correlated with the the choline (Cho)/creatine (Cr) and Cho/N-acetylaspartate (NAA) ratio on the corresponding voxel of interest and then 90% histogram cutoff of APT asymmetry values (APT90) for entire solid portions were calculated for diagnostic performance. An area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), leave-one-out cross validation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were analyzed. Result: APT asymmetry value showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.49, P < .001) with the Cho/Cr ratio and a mild correlation with the Cho/NAA ratio (r = 0.32, P = .011) in the corresponding lesion. APT90 showed a comparable diagnostic accuracy for glioma grading (AUC, 0.81 -0.84 versus 0.86; P = .582-.864) and a superior accuracy for differentiating tumor progression from treatment-related change (AUC, 0.89 -0.90 versus 0.60, P = .031-.046), compared with MR spectroscopy. The cross-validated AUC and accuracy of the APT90 in post-treatment gliomas were 0.89-0.90 and 72%, respectively. The inter-reader agreement for APT90 was excellent in both pretreatment and post-treatment gliomas (ICC, 0.95 and 0.96, respectively). Conclusion: In terms of tumor proliferative index, APT imaging shows a moderate correlation with MR spectroscopy and is superior imaging methodology particularly for assessing post-treatment gliomas, compared with MR spectroscopy.",

Akalin 3 1 Ege University Medical School, Department of Radiology, Izmir, TURKEY, 2 Ege University Medical School, Department of Neurosurgery, Izmir, TURKEY, 3 Ege University Medical School, Department of Pathology, Izmir, TURKEYPurpose: The objective is to enquire the contribution of the permeability parameters (Ktrans, Kep, Ve) obtained through DCE (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced) MR Perfusion imaging to staging of glial tumors. Methods: Perfusion imaging is a functional modality that provides information regarding the dynamics of tissue blood flow. Blood flow rate, blood volume and the structure of the capillary bed of the tissue are the factors that affect perfusion. CT perfusion and MR perfusion methods are kinetic methods used in the quantitative measurement of perfusion. DCE MR perfusion technique is based on the principle of diffusion of the paramagnetic contrast material into the extravascular extracellular cavity and the shortening of T1 relaxation time.Ktrans (the transendothelial transfer of the contrast material from the vein compartment to the tumor interstitium); Kep (the back transfer of the contrast material to the vein cavity) and Ve (extravascular extracellular volume fraction of the tumor) are the main parameters evaluated in DCE perfusion technique. 40 cases with intracranial mass were examined in 3T MR system through conventional MRI and DCE MRI perfusion imaging. In pathological evaluation, 21 of these patients were diagnosed with stage 4, 11 with stage 3, and 8 with stage 2 glial mass. In the cases, the Ktrans, Kep, Ve values were measured from the solid component of the tumor, the peritumoral vasogenic edema area and the opposite hemisphere white matter through ROI (region of interest) method. Result: In the measurements of the healthy parenchyma and solid component of the tumor in the opposite hemisphere, a statistically significant difference was observed in the comparison of Ktrans and Kep values. In the measurements made from the solid components of the tumors, a statitically significant difference existed in Kep values in the comparison of stage 2-3 and stage 4 tumors. Conclusion: DCE Perfusion MRI can be used in distinguishing stage 4 glial tumors from stage 2 and stage 3 glial tumors. Especially Kep values are significantly different in stage 4 tumors. In order evaluate the diagnostic success of DCE MR perfusion method in determining the stage of the tumor, more studies with larger groups of patients are needed.",

Thielen 1 1 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA Purpose: To illustrate the clinical merits of standing cone beam CT myelography.Methods: 100 patients with clinical symptoms of lower back pain and claudication who were referred for lumbar CT myelography underwent an additional standing cone beam CT acquisition. The myelographic examinations were performed on a commercially available myelographic table with tilt ability allowing complete vertical standing position and acquisition of cone beam CT study in the myelographic suite. Conventional post-myelogram CT of the lumbar spine in the recumbent position was also obtained on all patients. Evaluation included comparison in the degree of stenosis between standing cone beam and conventional recumbent CT examinations at all lumber levels in all patients. Result: Standing cone beam CT myelographic acquisitions were technically successful in 95 of 100 patients; motion artifact related to pain, collapsing posture and give-way weakness (4), and lack of spinal canal contrast opacification because CT done before running contrast (1). The cone beam reconstruction technique is relatively robust, and less susceptible to beam hardening artifact than conventional CT. Differences noted between standing and recumbent CT examinations included progression of spinal canal stenosis and/or neural foraminal stenosis from posturally dependant listhesis, increased disk protrusions with weight bearing, and greater redundancy of ligamentum flavum. Best use of standing CT myelography includes indications of severe claudication, and failed surgery leading to either instability or posturally dependant adjacent segment disease for fused cases. Changes in the degree of standing spinal canal stenosis and foraminal narrowing were most marked at interspaces with sclerosis and intradiscal gas.

The aim of the study is to evaluate its diagnostic utility in a clinical material. Methods: The material consisted of 102 examinations of 98 clinical patients, at least 13 years old, having focal intracranial lesions, single voxel MRS of good quality with saved raw data, and a confirmed diagnosis (neuropathological in 60%, the specimens were reviewed by two neuropathologists). MRS was obtained at 1.5 T using PRESS: TR/TE 5000-6000/20-30 ms. The data was processed with LCModel for conventional analysis and with jMRUI before importing into INTERPRET DSS. A neuroradiologist, blinded to the definite diagnosis but having referrals and earlier radiological examinations available, reviewed the MR images and repeated the review with MRS included. A radiology resident analysed all spectra with DSS and a radiologist 80 cases, independently. The diagnosis obtained with DSS was compared to the definite diagnosis. For comparisons between DSS, MRS without DSS, and MRI, the diagnoses were categorised: non-neoplastic lesion, low-grade tumor (WHO grade I-II), high-grade tumor (WHO grade III-IV). If the method yielded a correct and incorrect diagnostic category as alternatives, the outcome was considered indeterminate. Result: Both interpreters chose the same diagnosis from the DSS database in 60/80 (75%) cases. A correct specific diagnosis was obtained in 36/102 (35%) cases and incorrect in 62 cases (61%). No good matching was found in 4 cases (4%). The INTERPRET database, still limited in material, only included the diagnoses of 74/102 examinations. In 36 of them (49%), DSS yielded a correct diagnosis. Category distribution was: 26 non-neoplastic lesions, 20 low-grade tumors, 56 high-grade tumors. The category was correctly chosen with DSS/MRS without DSS/MRI in 67/60/54 cases, indeterminate in 4/8/20 cases, incorrect in 31/34/28 cases, respectively. MRS was not significantly better with than without DSS. DSS was better than MRI (p<0.05). Conclusion: INTERPRET DSS 3.1 was not significantly better than conventional MRS analysis in categorizing lesions. The limited size of the INTERPRET database affects the results but only one half of the lesions included in the database obtained a correct specific diagnosis.

We used the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol to acquire 3T MRI data for all patients and controls. Using our DTI data, we followed the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) approach in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We then applied the ICBM-DTI 81 White Matter Atlas to extract the fractional anisotropy values by regions of interest. We analyzed our demographic, clinical and imaging data with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Result: Patients and controls were comparable, demographic data showing no difference between these groups. Clinically, svPPA patients had significantly lower results at both the MOCA (p=0.001) and the MMSE tests (p=0.01). Compared to healthy controls, svPPA patients had statistically lower fractional anisotropy values (meaning impaired diffusion) in different fasciculi. The most significantly altered areas on the ICBM-DTI White Matter Atlas were the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and external capsule, as well as the right cingulum and uncinate fasciculus (p>0.001). Conclusion: The longitudinal, uncinate, cingulum and external capsule fasciculi are significantly altered in svPPA patients, compard to healthy matched controls. These localized degenerative changes demonstrate the clinical relevance of DTI for the differential diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia in its initial assessment.

Methods: Resting-State fMRI data from 19 SCA2 patients and 29 healthy controls were analyzed using an Independent Component Analysis and dual regression, controlling at voxel level for the effect of atrophy by covarying for gray matter volume. Correlations between the Resting State Networks alterations and disease duration, age at onset, number of triplets and clinical score were assessed by Spearman's coefficient for each cluster which was significantly different in SCA2 patients compared to healthy controls.Result: In SCA2 patients, disruption of the cerebellar components of all major Resting State Networks was present, with supratentorial involvement only for the Default Mode Network. When controlling at voxel level for gray matter volume, the reduction in functional connectivity in supratentorial regions of the Default Mode Network, and in cerebellar regions within the Default Mode, Executive and Right Fronto-Parietal networks, was still significant. No correlations with clinical variables were found for any of the investigated Resting State Networks. Conclusion: SCA2 patients show significant alterations of the Resting State Networks, only partly explained by the atrophy. The Default Mode Network is the only Resting State Network that shows also supratentorial changes, which appear unrelated to the cortical gray matter volume. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of these changes. C. Mondino National Neurological Institute, Brain MRI 3T Mondino Research Center, Pavia, ITALY, 2 C.

And they could influence on results of perfusion MRI of brain tumors. To investigate dynamic contrast enhancement patterns of nonionic agent to those of ionic agent, we compared nonionic agents (Gadovist\u00ae and Omniscan\u00ae) and ionic agents (Dotarem\u00ae and Magnevist\u00ae) in rodent brain tumor models.Methods: The BALB/c nude mice (5 weeks old, n=20) were secured in a rodent stereotaxic frame and a hollow guide screw introduced through a small drill hole and 1X106 human glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cell line (U373) in 4 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the brain. For all MRI experiments were used a 4.7 T MRI (BioSpec 47/40; Bruker, Germany) with a 25 mm inner diameter quadrature RF coil. Dynamic contrast enhancement MR imaging (3D T1W-GRE sequence, TR/TE = 160.0/2.5ms, flip angle = 30.0) was performed after i.v. injection with same dose of contrast agents (0.1 mmol/kg, 5 animals each agents respectively) and repeated every 1 minute up to 170 minutes.

A multivariate modelling analysis built by combining MRI biomarkers with each other was performed. Significant differences between benign (n=5) and malignant (n=9) ring enhancing lesions were tested with Mann-Withney U test. Diagnostic efficacy of univariate and multivariate modelling analysis methods was tested with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and supervised partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Result: from univariate analysis only IC-rADC was found to be a predictive feature of abscess (AUC 0.909, p 0.002). Several MRI biomarkers ratios from multivariate modelling analysis(IC-rADC/IC-Cho, IC-rADC/IC-FA, IC-rCBV/IC-Cho, IC-rADC/PL-FA, IC-rADC/IC-Cr, RE-rCBV/RE-FA, IC-rCBV/PL-Succinate, IC-rCBV/IC-Cr, IC-rADC/RE-FA, IC-rCBV/PL-Cr, IC-rCBV/Succinate) achieved higher area under the curve (AUC) compared to IC-rADC.

Neuroradiologia, Milan, ITALY, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele -U.O. Anatomia Patologica, Milan, ITALY, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele -U.O. Neurochirurgia, Milan, ITALYPurpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using different softwares on the reproducibility of perfusion parameters obtained in a group of gliomas. Data obtained were used to evaluate intra and interobserver reproducibility (intra-software reproducibility) and inter-software reproducibility. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated DCE (Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI) and DSC (Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI) data sets of 20 patients with gliomas (8 WHO II, 4 WHO III and 8 WHO IV) using a 3.0 Tesla magnet. Perfusion data were postprocessed with two software packages: NordicIce (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) and Olea Sphere (Olea Sphere, Olea Medical Solutions, La Ciotat, France); in Olea Sphere both automatic and manual detection of vascular input function (VIF) was used. Parametric maps of Ktrans and Vp were obtained from DCE data sets; parametric map of CBV from DSC data sets. For each parameter we evaluated the maximal abnormality through hotspots-based method. All patients were analyzed by two indipendent observers blinded to the histological grade using both softwares. Each observer repeated the analysis after one month to evaluate intraobserver reproducibility. Additionally, in each patient we compared DCE parameters obtained selecting the same ROIs with the two softwares. To asses reproducibility of data we used the ICC (intraclass correlation coefficient) and Bland-Altman analysis. As a secondary aim of the study we also compared the perfusion findings with the WHO histological grade. Result: The ICC for intra and interobserver reproducibility was higher than 0.8 in almost all cases for each parameter and each software suggesting almost perfect agreement. The ICC for intersoftware reproducibility ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 suggesting only poor to moderate agreement. The comparison of the WHO histological grade and the perfusion parameters showed different accuracy depending on the software used. Conclusion: Our results show that each software guarantees almost perfect intra and interobserver reproducibility for each perfusion parameter. Best reproducibility is obtained when automatic detecting of VIF is selected in Olea Sphere. The finding of low inter-software reproducibility suggests that caution has to be made when comparing results obtained with different softwares platforms.

Keywords Pituitary Adenoma,TSA,Dynamic MRI Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and angiographical results of Vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) treated with endovascular treatment (ET), Methods: Between 1996 and 2013, 89 patients with DAVAs were treated with ET (M*:F=45:44; mean age, 54.6 years). Of these,65 were ruptured , 4 were symptomatic uruptured and 24 were asymptomatic. DAVAs were classified into four types on the basis of location of the aneurysms in relation to the PICA . From this classification and developmental status of contralateral vertebral artery, different ET were selected. Result: 43 VADAs located distal to PICA (PICA distal), 19 did not have ipsilateral IPICA (No PICA), 15 located at the origin of PICA (PICA involve) and 12 located proximal to PICA (PICA Proximal). Contralateral VA were equal or dominant in 48, recessive in 15 and aplasia in 10. Overall, 66 VADAs were treated with internal trapping, 13 were treated with proximal VA occlusion ( PICA Proximal:7, PICA Involve: 6), and 10 were treated with stent assist coil embolization ( Contralateral VA aplasia:10). Peri-operative complications occurred in 6 patients including 3 brainstem of cerebellar infarctions (internal trapping for No PICA type:3), re-rupture after ET (day 7 and day 8) and one intraoperative re-rupture.

Keywords Paraclinoid aneurysm,Distal dural ring,High-resolution MR imaging Purpose: Stent-assisted coiling of acutely ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms is controversial because of concerns about the risk of using antiplatelet therapy. Dual microcatheter technique is an alternative in these aneurysms and it does not require antiplatelet therapy. In this study we assess the safety and long-term efficacy of this technique for the treatment of acutely ruptured wide-necked aneurysms. Methods: A retrospective review of 49 patients with ruptured widenecked intracranial aneurysms treated with dual microcatheter technique was done. The angiographic results, treatment-related complications, and clinical outcome were documented. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used for clinical outcome. Angiographic follow-up using digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography was available in 30 patients at a mean of 18.2 months. Both postembolization and follow-up angiograms were graded on a 3-point Raymond scale. Aneurysms were classified as stable, improved, or recanalized based on the follow-up 7%) aneurysms demonstrated recanalization. Four aneurysms with recanalization were retreated endovascularly; there was one aneurysm of re-rupture in follow-up, which was incompletely packed initially. Conclusion: Dual microcatheter technique is safe and effective for coil embolization of acutely ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms with a low treatment-related complication, morbidity, and mortality rate. However, the high rate of postembolization incomplete occlusion and recanalization remains the main challenge. More and longer term angiographic follow-up information is needed to better define the durability of treatment.Keywords Wide-necked aneurysms,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Dual-microcatheter technique ECO8:05 TREATMENT OF RUPTURED BLOOD-BLISTER-LIKE ANEURYSMS IN THE SUBACUTE PHASE: CLINICAL AND ANGIOGRAPHIC OUTCOME F Di Maria 1 , F Clarencon 1 , J Gabrieli 1 , A Nouet 1 , J Chiras 1 , N Sourour 1 Groupe Hospitalier Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Charles Foix, Paris, FRANCE",

Menezes 2 Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Rome, ITALY, 2 University College of London, London, UNITED KINGDOM Purpose: To evaluate the potential role of CT texture as a marker of plaque vulnerability.Methods: From a patient population of 341 patients with cardiovascular risk factors we identify 12 patients (7 male; age 72\u00b110.37 yrs) with carotid atherosclerosis and a subsequent history of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke.These were age and sex matched with 12 control cases (7 male; age 71.3\u00b19.86 yrs) with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (follow-up time 103.58\u00b19.2 months). Carotid artery stenosis and plaque composition (lipid, calcified or mixed) were determined. Texture analysis was performed using a commercially available software package (TexRAD, Somerset, UK) by a single operator blinded to clinical data. TexRAD uses a filtration-histogram based texture analysis technique to extract pixel size based (fine, medium, coarse) features and quantified histogram parameters including Kurtosis (K), skewness (S) and normalized standard-deviation (SDn). A single axial slice was selected to best represent the carotid bifurcation for each side and a region of interest (ROI) was manually delineated in order to fully enclose the artery. Statistical analysis was performed using X2, t-test and Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. Result: Stenosis degree was greater in the right internal carotid artery of patients with TIA (41\u00b135 vs 6\u00b112; p=0.006), however no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for stenosis degree in left internal carotid artery (p=0.746) and plaque composition (p=0.485 and p=0.705). There was a statistically significant difference in Skewness between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients for post filtration at the fine and medium texture level (p=0.009 for spatial scaling factor (SSF) =2mm; p<0.001 for SSF=3mm and p=0.003 for SSF=4mm). SDn was statistically significant different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients for spatial scaling factor =2mm (p=0.033). Conclusion: CT texture identified vulnerable plaque in Stroke and TIA, whereas degree of stenosis and plaque composition did not. CT texture may have the potential to act as a new means of risk stratification in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.TEXTURE ANALISIS,CAROTID ARTERY,plaque vulnerability EPO:129 ACCURACY OF GADOTERIDOL ENHANCED MR-ANGIOGRAPHY IN THE EVALUATION OF CAROTID ARTERY STENOSISTHE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF MR ANGIOGRAPHY (MRA) IN EVALUATING CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS, COMPARING THE DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF GADOTERIDOL ENHANCED MRA WITH GADOBUTROL ENHANCED MRA.

Mondino National Neurological Institute, Neurology, Pavia, ITALYPurpose: To identify and localize (acute) punctuate hippocampal lesions after transitory global amnesia is important to confirm the diagnosis. The detection rate of such lesions has been reported as dependent by several DWI parameters. In this retrospective case series of 20 consecutive patients studied within four days, we found an high detection rate of hippocampal and (one) parahippocampal punctuate lesions by applying a 3T MRI protocol with long TE (150 ms) DWI. In a subsample of patients studied also with standard short TE (98ms) DWI, we confirm the higher sensitivity of long TE DWI. Methods: 20 patients admitted to our Neurological Institute and fitting diagnostic criteria for transient global amnesia(Caplan 1985, Hodges  1990 were consecutively studied by 3T MRI within four days from symptoms. By a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner with 32 channel phase array headcoil, the following optimized MRI protocol was acquired in every patients: axial DWI, volumetric sagittal FLAIR, high resolution coronal T2. Result: 18/20 patients presented DWI punctuate hyperintensities within mesiotemporal lobes, all in hippocampi but one patient, with a lesion within the deep white matter close to left hippocampus. In 4 patients studied with boh DWI sequences, the lesion visibility was always better on DWI with the long TE (150ms) compared to DWI with short TE (98ms).

Spenger 1 , F. Reininghaus 1 , T. Hauer 1 , J. Harlap 1 , V.E. Gomes Gouveia 1 , E. Westman 2Purpose: Hippocampal volume loss is an established radiological biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it can be difficult to decide by visual inspection whether the hippocampal volume is in the normal range or not, in particular since hippocampal volume changes with age. Hence, we have implemented a fully automated, web based system, \"appMRI Hippocampus Volume analyser\" (appMRI HVA) to calculate the hippocampal volume quantitatively for clinical use. The purpose of this work was to validate the percentile ranking chart of appMRI HVA. Methods: The percentile ranking chart, showing total hippocampal volume as function of age, was calculated using magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 103 control subjects of the AddNeuroMed study. Total hippocampal volume was assessed using appMRI HVA (hipp.appmri.com). The total hippocampal volumes of 137 AD-and 156 control-subjects from the ADNI study were compared to the 5% percentile curve and true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative numbers assessed and the sensitivity and specificity calculated using MedCalc statistical software. Result: Out of 156 control subjects, 147 were above and 9 below the 5th percentile, validating position and slope of the percentile curve. True positive number was 86, false positive number was 51, true negative number was 147 and false negative number was 9. Hence, the sensitivity and specificity was 90.5% and 74.2% respectively. Conclusion: The fact that 5.7 % of the control subjects of the ADNI cohort was below the 5% percentile supports the comparability of the ADNI and AddNeuroMed datasets and validates the percentile chart.Hippocampal volume,Alzheimer's disease,Software EPO:133 NEUROIMAGING OF PATHOLOGICALLY PROVED TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY: DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES K.

Recently, it has been reported that PSP comprises not only typical cases (i.e., Richardson's syndrome) but also various clinical subtypes with atypical symptoms such as levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, non-fluent aphasia and corticobasal syndrome. As well as clinical symptoms, the degree of midbrain atrophy, a well-known imaging hallmark, is not consistent in pathologically proved atypical PSP patients. This fact has important implications for the limitation of midbrain atrophy as a diagnostic biomarker of PSP pathology. The purpose of this study is to review magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of pathologically proved typical and atypical PSP patients for educational presentations of the imaging spectrum of PSP. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed conventional MRI mainly including T1-weighted, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of 11 pathologically diagnosed PSP patients. Additionally, voxel based morphometry (VBM) analyses had been performed in six patients. Result: As expected, typical PSP patients revealed typical atrophy of the midbrain and superior cerebellar peduncle. Contrary to typical patients, other findings including the atrophy of the frontal lobe, cerebral peduncle and globus pallidus were more conspicuous in atypical cases. Notably, the atrophy of the left inferior frontal gyrus in a patient with non-fluent aphasia (PSP-PNFA) and asymmetrical paracentral white matter atrophy in a patient with corticobasal syndrome (PSP-CBS) were characteristic findings. On the other hand, a patient with pure akinesia with gait freezing (PSP-PAGF) revealed only mild atrophy of the globus pallidus. In addition to these atrophic changes, some patients revealed dilatation of the third and fourth ventricle and T2 prolongation of the globus pallidus and brainstem tegmentum. VBM analyses were useful for the objective evaluation of the subtle atrophy of the frontal lobe white matter and basal ganglia which were difficult for visual assessment. Conclusion: Radiologists should understand that in addition to the midbrain atrophy, PSP patients revealed the various imaging findings including abnormalities of the frontal lobe, globus pallidus and brainstem.

MRI and DWI technique are the first step in diagnostic assessment when high tissue specificity and sensitivity are required. On DWI cholesteatoma is hyperintense, in part because of a restricted water diffusion, in part because its content of keratin produces high signal intensity in the pathological area (T2-shine-through effect),as shown calculating ADC values. Aim of the study is to define a range of ADC values, within which the diagnosis of cholesteatoma is certain. Methods: From April 2011 to April 2015, we studied 76 patients (41 females; 35 men; mean age 38,9Y) with suspicion of unilateral cholesteatoma. Patients underwent preoperative MRI few days before first or second-look surgery; diagnosis was confirmed histologically. Protocol was approved by local Ethical Committee and written informed consent was previously obtained from all patients. MRI was performed on a 1.5TMR unit (Philips Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) with an 8-channel head coil and consisted in conventional sequences and coronal MSH non-EPI DWI. For MSH-TSE DWI, cardiac gating was performed in order to limit artifacts due to heart pulse/blood flow. ADC maps were calculated by a 15years-experienced neuroradiologist by placing a ROI of 1cm2 in the central portion of the lesion. We considered the average of ADC values within the ROI. Statistical analysis was performed with the Ttest, comparing the average ADC value of histologically confirmed cases of cholesteatoma versus histologically identified inflammatory lesions. Result: In 55 cases, cholesteatoma was confirmed histologically. Average ADC value for cholesteatomas was 0.80x10_3mm2/s (range:0,41x10_3/ 1,17x10_3mm2/s), for inflammatory lesions was 1.9x10_3mm2/s (range:1,19x10_3/2,44x10_3mm2/s) with no overlapping values in the two groups. The difference between this two groups was statistically significant for p<0.01. No significant difference was found between primary and recurrent cholesteatomas.Conclusion: Mean ADC values in cholesteatomas are significantly lower compared to inflammatory lesions. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of ADC value overlap in larger series. Our findings suggest that calculation of ADC values from MSH-DWI non-EPI can assist in the diagnosis of cholesteatoma in case with questionable clinical and imaging findings.

Whereas thalamic damage has been demonstrated in both diseases, the degeneration of the superior cerebellar peduncle has been selectively reported in PSP. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of the pathological changes on functional connectivity (FC) within the thalamic and cerebellar resting state networks (RSNs) in these two pathologies. Methods: We recruited 19 patients with probable PSP, 11 patients with propable CBS and 12 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects (HS). Functional MRI at rest was performed using a 3.0 Tesla scanner (Verio Siemens). Functional MRI data were processed by means of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library) tools; thalamus and dentate nucleus were used as seed regions to identify the thalamic and cerebellar RSN, respectively. The threshold for statistical significance was set at p<0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons. Result: Both PSP and CBS groups displayed lower FC than HS in both RSNs. No significant differences in the FC of the thalamic RSN were observed between the two patient groups.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 23 patients with clinically-diagnosed AD (age; 80.8\u00b13.4, male: female; 6: 17, MMSE score; 19.3\u00b13.8) who had undergone routine and 3D T1-weighted MRI for detailed examination of dementia from 2011 to 2013 in our hospital. As an adjunct of differential diagnosis of dementia, twenty-two out of 23 patients underwent 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy, which revealed normal H/M ratio on early and delayed phases. Then, we measured maximum thickness of hippocampus and diameter of inferior horn, and calculated hippocampal atrophy ratio (HAR: maximum diameter of inferior horn divided by thickness of hippocampus) on coronal FLAIR and reconstructed coronal T1-weighted image, which were vertical to anterior commissure -posterior commissure line and contained right mammillary body. We also calculated Z score (value of ADspecific gray matter atrophy compared with normal database bundled with VSRAD) with 3D T1-weighted MRI and VSRAD as a gold standard and performed correlated analyses between HAR and Z score. Result: HAR on coronal FLAIR image was right; 0.97\u00b10.37, left; 0.91 \u00b10.35, Z score on VSRAD was right; 2.12\u00b11.33, left; 1.91\u00b10.89, correlation coefficient was right; 0.60, left; 0.72, respectively.

Of 11 patients with tonsillar herniation, 7 patients demonstrated mild (n=3) and severe (n=4) CSF flow disturbances but the other 4 did not. Four patients without tonsillar herniation had CSF flow disturbances (mild, 3; severe, 1) on 3D T2 SPACE. Of 4 patients who did not show CSF flow disturbances on 3D T2 SPACE irrespective of tonsillar descent, two patients did not have abnormal CSF flow at the foramen magnum on cine CSF flow study. Of 4 patients who showed CSF flow disturbances on 3D T2 SPACE, but without tonsillar descent, two patients demonstrated the similar abnormal CSF flow at the foramen magnum on cine CSF flow study. Conclusion: 3D T2 SPACE can be used to find CSF flow disturbances at the foramen magnum and may also be useful for classifying them.Chiari type I malformation,Cerebrospinal fluid dynamics,3D T2weighted imaging EPO:141 ASS ESS ME NT OF BL OOD -BRAI N BAR RIER (BBB ) INTEGRITY BY DYNAMIC CONTRAST ENHANCED MRI IN TRANSIENT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY OCCLUSION (TMCAO) MODEL AFTER LOCALIZED BRAIN COOLING E.

An experienced neuroradiologist, blinded to the definite diagnosis but having referrals and earlier radiological examinations available, interpreted the MR images and repeated the review with MRS included. The neuropathological specimens were reviewed by two neuropathologists. Both single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and chemical shift imaging (CSI) were performed in 105 cases, only SVS or CSI in 54 and 49 cases, respectively. MRS parameters: 1.5 T, SVS: PRESS TR/TE 5000-6000/20-30 ms, CSI: TR/TE 1500-2500/135-144 ms. The SVS data was processed by LCModel and CSI data by the softwares of the imager manufacturers. The diagnoses on MRI and MRS were compared with the definite diagnoses. Clinical diagnoses were grouped into categories: non-neoplastic disease, low-grade tumor (WHO grade I-II), high-grade tumor (WHO grade III-IV). If the method yielded a correct and incorrect diagnostic category as alternatives, the outcome was considered indeterminate. MRI and MRS were also compared to see which of them gave more information to the clinician. The method was considered: 1. very beneficial stating the correct diagnostic group or location for a lesion when the other method did not, 2. beneficial ruling out suspected diseases or being more specific compared with the other method, 3. not beneficial containing the same level of information, 4. misleading containing less or non-correct information. Result: The confirmed diagnoses were: 70 non-neoplastic lesions, 43 low-grade tumors and 95 high-grade tumors. For MRI, the results were: 130 cases (62.5%) correct, 39 cases (19%) indeterminate, 39 cases (19%) incorrect. With added MRS, the results were: 134 cases (64%) correct, 23 cases (11%) indeterminate, 51 (25%) incorrect. Additional information from MRS was: very beneficial in 7 cases (3%), beneficial in 24 cases (12%), not beneficial in 141 cases (68%), misleading in 36 cases (17%).Conclusion: When MRS is performed for clinical indications (uncertain or insufficient information on MRI), addition of MRS does not improve the diagnostic accuracy.The comparisons were made between disease categories. In selected cases, MRS may be a valuable method.

The DCE-MR and diffusion images were post-processed by using commercially available software (nordicICE, NordicNEuroLab). Quantitative parameters (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp, AUC60-area under the signal intensity-time curve at initial 60s) from DCE-MRI and ADC value from DWI were calculated within the manually placed ROI plotted around the main tumor on every image slice. Histogram parameters consisting of mean, median, 25th, 75th percentile value, skewness and kurtosis of DCE-MRI parameters and ADC values were compared between the HPV-positive andnegative groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.Result: 12 patients were HPV-positive (50.0%). Mean, median, 25th, 75th percentile value of Kep were significantly higher in HPV-positive group (p=0.006). Any other values, skewness or kurtosis of parameters were not significantly different between HPV-positive and -negative patients. Conclusion: Our preliminary evidence promise imaging parameters could reflect the tumor genetic and histologic features associated with HPV in OPSCC. oropharyngeal squamous cell ca,human papillomavirus,perfusion, diffusion parameter EPO:144 FEASIBILITY OF HIGH-RESOLUTION MR IMAGING FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF POSTERIOR INFERIOR CEREBELLAR ARTERY DISSECTION M Han 1 , J S Lee 1 , S Y Kim 1 , J W Choi 1 Ajou University Medial Center, Suwon, SOUTH KOREA Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of HR-MR imaging diagnosing posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) dissection and to find most useful imaging findings suggesting dissection Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 104 patients suspected of having arterial dissection involving posterior cerebral circulation and underwent HR-MR imaging between March 2012 and March 2015. 66 patients were diagnosed with arterial dissection involving posterior cerebral circulation and 16 patients among them (24.2%) were diagnosed with isolated PICA d i s s e c t i o n b y t h e c o n s e n s u s a m o n g n e u r o r a d i o l o g i s t s , neurointerventionist and neurologist after reviewing all clinical andparaclinical investigations available at hospital discharge (initial CT, MR, DSA images and etiologic work-ups) and follow up. Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed the HR-MR images of patients finally diagnosed as PICA dissection and looked for evidence of dissection (mural hematoma, dissection flap, outer diameter enlargement on T2WI) on each sequence of HR-MRI (PDWI, T2WI, T1WI and CE-T1WI). Interand intraobserver agreement for detecting evidence of dissection was estimated using the Cohen's kappa coefficient. Result: Dissection flaps were seen in all cases on T2WI (100%) and secondly detected on CE-T1WI (81.3%). Outer-diameter enlargement of the steno-occlusive lesions on angiography was detected in most of cases (81.3%). A mural hematoma was best detected on CE-T1WI (50.0%). The two reviewers showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for detecting dissection signs on every sequence (Cohen's kappa coefficient: 0.63~0.94) Conclusion: HR-MR imaging could be a useful and non-invasive diagnostic tool for PICA dissection and dissection flap with outer wall enlargement on T2WI is most confident sign for suggesting dissection.PICA dissection,High resolution MR EPO:145 NON-INVASIVE QUANTIFICATION OF BRAIN PERFUSION AND CEREBRAL HAEMODYNAMICS WITH QUASAR ARTERIAL SPIN LABELING (ASL) IN PATIENTS WITH CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROTIC STENOSIS C.

BT was estimated from MD value of corticospinal fluid measured in the segmented region of the subarachnoid space on a slice showing the centrum semiovale and it was calculated with T [\u00b0C] = 2256.74/ln[(4392.2\u00d710-3)/MD]-273.15. WM damage was also assessed on the same slice using FA from the same DTI dataset. Normality distribution and correlation were examined by Shapiro-Wilk test and Pearson correlation coefficient with p<0.05. Result: MRI acquisition was successfully performed in all patients. Both BT and FA showed the normal distributions (p=0.2072 and 0.2736, respectively) and significant correlation was observed between BT and FA (r = 0.6483, p=0.0165). One of 13 patients showed delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) on Day 27 after CO exposure, which is well-known that it shows deep CWM damage in the subacute phase and this patient showed the lowest BT and FA in all patients. It suggested that the brain metabolism in DNS patient might be reduced less than the other patients. Conclusion: BT and CWM damage estimated by DTI may help us to assess the brain metabolism in CO-poisoned patient.brain temperature,diffusion tensor imaging,carbon monoxide poisoning EPO:147 MRI ASSESSMENT OF VASCULAR CONTACT OF THE FACIAL NERVE IN THE ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENT G.

Barrs 2 Mayo Clinic Arizona, Dept of Radiology, Scottsdale, USA, 2 Mayo Clinic Arizona, Dept. of Otolaryngology, Scottsdale, USAPurpose: Vascular contact of the facial nerve is widely believed to be a cause of hemifacial spasm (HFS). The prevalence of facial nerve vascular contact on MRI in patients without HFS has not been well described in the literature. Methods: Our radiology data base was queried to identify adult patients evaluated with high-resolution MRI of the posterior fossa (volumetric T2 and T1 post-contrast sequences with triplanar reconstructions). Following exclusion of patients with a history of HFS, intracranial tumor, brain radiation therapy, intracranial surgery, or trigeminal nerve vascular compression, 100 consecutive MRI's (81 at 1.5 Tesla, 19 at 3 Tesla) were independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists for facial nerve vascular contact (200 sides). When vascular contact was identified, the facial nerve segment contacted was recorded (brainstem, root entry zone (REZ), or cisternal). When identifiable, the vessel responsible for the contact was recorded. Vascular contact was graded as mild, moderate or severe. Result: The cohort had a mean age of 55 years (range 22-89 years) and included 36 men and 64 women. The first neuroradiologist identified vascular contact in 83 of 200 facial nerves (41.5%). The segment contacted was brainstem in 23%, REZ in 32% and cisternal segment in 45%. Vascular contact was caused by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in 13%, anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) in 69%, and a vein in 18%. Contact was mild in 83% and moderate in 17%. The second neuroradiologist identified vascular contact in 73 of 200 facial nerves (36.5%). The segment contacted was brainstem in 11%, REZ in 36% and cisternal segment in 53%. Vascular contact was caused by the vertebral artery in 1%, PICA in 9%, AICA in 60%, and a vein in 30%. Contact was mild in 77% and moderate in 23%. No cases of severe neurovascular compression were identified by either neuroradiologist. Conclusion: Vascular contact of the facial nerve is frequently identified in the asymptomatic patient, typically mild to moderate in severity, most commonly involves the cisternal segment, and usually caused by the AICA. These results should be considered in assessing the candidacy of HFS patients for microvascular decompression.EPO:148 MR MICRONEUROGRAPHY: A NON-INVASIVE TOOL FOR MORPHOMETRIC STUDY OF THE TIBIAL NERVE P.

Matteo Foundation, Pavia, ITALYPurpose: To characterize and quantify the tibial nerve gross anatomy with an acquisition and segmentation protocol of Magnetic Resonance (MR) microneurography using 3D Spoiled Gradient Echo (SPGR) with IDEAL sequences. Methods: 14 healthy volunteers were investigated at the ankle level to obtain axial MR images of the posterior tibial nerve. Imaging was performed on a Discovery MR750 3T scanner (GE Healthcare, USA). Acquisition parameters: IDEAL 3D SPGR with TR 16 ms, TE 6 ms, flip angle 10\u00b0, matrix size 512 x 420, FOV 5 cm, slice thickness 2 mm for a coverage of 2.8cm, bandwidth 25 kHz, NEX 1, time scan approx. 7 min. The nerve was manually segmented by two experienced operators (PFF, SB) in the IN Phase image, where the nerve boundary was clearly visible. This region of interest (ROI) was used to mask the nerve in the water image, where 2 class segmentation was performed using FSL FAST 1. Fascicular volume (FV), epineurial volume (EV), nerve volume (NV), and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR) were quantified in the 2.8 cm covered using partial volume estimation. Inter-observer agreement was computed using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result: MR microneurograms demonstrated the various components of the nerve such as the external and internal epineurium, the nerve fascicles and even the perineurium. In the 2.8 cm covered, NV average was 276 mm3. The mean FV was 192 mm3 (range 124-251 mm3). The mean EV was 83 mm3 (range 52-137 mm3). The mean FNR was 0.69% (range 61-76%). The interobserver reliability was excellent for both FNR and NV (ICC of 0.975 and 0.967 respectively). Conclusion: Morphological detail usually achieved with conventional MR neurography is insufficient for automatic segmentation of nerve structure. We propose an acquisition and segmentation protocol for reliable quantification of peripheral nerve structural parameters thanks to the high resolution of MR microneurography. NVand FV may measure nerve and fascicular enlargement reflecting edema. EV may be correlated with intraepineurial adipose proliferation in chronic neuropathies. Despite of a limited coverage, our results are promising and suggest a possible role of MR microneurography in characterizing the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of peripheral nerve damage.MRI,Neurography,Microscopy EPO:149 FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING IN LATE LIFE DEPRESSION PATIENTS: A RESTING STATE STUDY F.

Di Giannantonio 1University G d'Annunzio Chieti-Pescara; Department of Neuroscience, Imaging and Clinical Sciences, Chieti, ITALY Purpose: Late life depression (LLD), occurs at age 65 or older, is estimated to affect 10% to 15% of the population. LLD patients have heterogeneous clinical features characterized by anhedonia, depressed mood, guilt and suicidal thoughts, in association with somatic complaints such as alteration of sleep-wake rhythm, loss or gain of weight, decreased libido and increased fatigue. Several studies have shown an association between depressive symptoms and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Previous studies showed modification of the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Self-Referential Network (SRN). The aim of this study was to investigate the modifications of the intrinsic functional connectivity within resting state networks in LLD patients. Methods: After neuropsychological, neurological and psychiatric assessment, we study the resting state networks in 10 LLD patients (8 females; mean age 67,6\u00b13,44 SD) and 1l healthy subjects (8 females; mean age 66 \u00b15,27 SD). Functional and structural MRI imaging was performed by means of a 3T Scanner. BOLD fMRI data were acquired in four runs lasting four minutes each by means of a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TE=35ms, matrix size 64 \u00d7 64, FOV 256 mm, voxel size 4 \u00d7 4 x 4 mm, 30 slices, TR=1671 ms. A high resolution structural volume was acquired via a 3D fast field echo T1-weighted sequence (matrix 256 \u00d7 256, voxel size 1x1x1, flip angle 12\u00b0, TR = 9.7 ms and TE = 4 ms). After preprocessing, data were analysed using the self-organizing group-level ICA algorithm implemented in BrainVoyager QX. Result: Among decomposed networks, between group differences were observed in leftFPN (Fronto Parietal Network)  and SMN (Somatomotor network). For left FPN, differences were observed in Dorso Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) and left Superior Parietal Lobule (SPL), whereas for SMN in Primary Somatosensory Cortex (p<0.05 FDR corrected). Conclusion: We hypothesize that the dysfunction in the FPN could explain the impaired cognitive control in LLD patients and some depressive symptoms. For the SMN alteration, we hypothesize that LLD patients could show a higher somatosensory perception to external environmental stimulation than healthy controls.

Our purpose is to describe the automated parcellation method of region of interest (ROI) with the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) tool for measuring WM maturation in childhood and adolescence.Methods: Sixty-six healthy children (37 girls, 29 boys; mean age, 11.5 years; range, 4.2-17.7 years) underwent six-direction DTI with a 3-T MRI system. The images were processed using the MRIstudio software suite (www.mristudio.org, Johns Hopkins University; JHU) comprised of DtiStudio, DiffeoMap, and ROIeditor. First, DtiStudio was used to map fractional anisotropy (FA); apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); axial diffusivity (AD); and radial diffusivity (RD). Second, ROIeditor was used to skull-strip of those maps. Third, DiffeoMap was used to spatial normalization of the skull-stripped maps. Fourth, those maps were used as our subject utilizing an atlas to subject linear transformation. Finally, LDDMM was utilized for the non-linear transformation. The resultant linear transformation matrix and the resultant LDDMM transformation matrix were applied to the WM Parcellation Map type II (WMPM II). The atlas-based analysis was completed using ROIeditor, so parcellation maps of total 130 ROIs were segmented. ROI statistics of four DTI maps were calculated as between 0.00 and 1.00 for 130 regions, then statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the data for some WM areas. Result: The corpus callosum were chosen for analysis. Increases in FA and AD values with age were noted, whereas high rate of decreases were noted in RD values. In most DTI studies, the importance of FA values in early life has been emphasized. However, a number of investigators have outlined the difficulties with accepting FA values as a measure of myelination.",

Cera 1 , F. Cieri 1 , R. Esposito 1 , M. Di Giannantonio 1 , A. Tartaro 1Purpose: The seed-based functional connectivity(fc) during resting state fMRI(rsfMRI) has shown to be a reliable technique to study the temporal cross-correlations among cortical regions, which could be considered a good index of brain functioning. We aim to assess the reliability of seed based fc as a data analysis technique able to detect alterations of aging related disorders, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Late Life Depression (LLD), considering the subregions of the insula as seeds. Insulae are hidden by frontal and temporal opercula and play a key role in several functions and can be divided in subregions. The anterior and the posterior areas are related to distinct functional networks altered in neurological disorders.Methods: Participants: 26 adults (age: 25-35 years), 26 healthy elderly and 13 MCI and 10 LLD(age: 60-80 years) . RsfMRI data were collected with a 3T scanner : 3 runs T2*weighted:EPI, TE=35ms, matrix=64\u00d764, FOV 256 mm, voxel size 4mm3, 140 volumes; T1: matrix=256\u00d7256, FOV 256 mm, voxel size 1mm3, flip angle 12\u00b0, TR = 9.7 ms and TE = 4 ms. After pre-processing and Talairach space normalization, 4 seeds were selected in 2 horizontal planes: left / righ anterior/ posterior insulae (aiLH, aiRH, piLH and piRH). Signals were z normalized and ortogonalized. To assess the reliability a between group comparison was performed . Result: Fc maps were calculated for the seeds and a voxel-wise ANOVA ( between-group factor = young, healthy elderly, MCI, LLD) was performed for each map. For aiLH, \"healthy elderly>young\" (p<0.05 FDR corr.) showed decreased fc in dACC , for aiRH (P<0.05 Bonferroni's corr.) decreased fc in dACC and for piLH decreased fc in putamen (P<0.05 Bonf. corr.). \"MCI>healthy elderly\"(p<0.05 FDR corr.) showed decreased fc for aiLH values in ACC and increased piRH fc values in theBA5. For aiLH 'LLD>healthy elderly\" showed increased fc levels in left angular gyrus. \"LLD>MCI\" showed increased fc in the left angular gyrus(p<0.05 FDR corr.). Conclusion: Our results showed that seed based is reliable to detect alterations in pathological aging. We observed an increased fc in the LLD between the anterior insula and regions related to decision making, and internal state control.fMRI,Functional connectivity,Aging EPO:155 EVALUATION OF WHITE MATTER ABNORMALITY IN MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT USING DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING: A COMPARISON OF TRACT-BASED SPATIAL STATISTICS B.

Diffusion tensor imaging is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique that has been used to evaluate the integrity of white matter tracts in vivo. We aimed to evaluate white matter abnormalities on diffusion tensor imaging in patients with MCI, using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Methods: 20 MCI patients and 20 age, gender and education matched healthy elderly subjects underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. A fractional anisotropy (FA) map was generated for each participant. Voxel-based group comparison statistics of fractional anisotropy was estimated using TBSS, which is provided in FSL software package. Result: TBSS showed that FA was significantly lower in MCI than in the healthy elderly group in the body and genu of corpus callosum, forceps minor, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, right anterior thalamic radiation, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, right cingulum and right superior corona radiata. Conclusion: TBSS is a useful method in examining the degeneration of white matter tracts and showed abnormalities in white matter in patients with MCI compared with healthy elderly group.Mild cognitive impairment,Diffusion tensor imaging,Tract-based spatial statisticsEPO:156 INTRAVOXEL INCOHERENT MOTION MAGNETIC R E S O N A N C E I M A G I N G I N T H E B R A I N T U M O R : TECHNICAL NOTESA Catanese 1 , D Casolino 2 , F Malacario 3 , C Zenesini 4 , F Toni 4 , L Cirillo 4 , R Agati 4 Department of Radiology -University of Bologna, Bologna, ITALY, 2 Olea Medical, La Ciotat, FRANCE, 3 Department of Radiology -University of Naples Federico II, Napoli, ITALY, 4 Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna -Bellaria Hospital, Bologna, ITALYPurpose: Intra Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) is a potential noninvasive tool for diagnosis in brain tumours, still there aren't clear guidelines for its evaluation. In our study we compare IVIM with Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI (DSC) in primary brain tumours stressing the issues found during the acquisition set-up and post processing step. Methods: Twenty-eight patients (mean age 56 years), part of them treated with chemo or radiotherapy, underwent MRI (3T, Sigma Excite GE) with 8 channel Phase-array HR coil. Spin echo echo-planar sequence (SE-EPI) with 13 b-values (0 -1.300 s/mm2) was used for DWI acquisition, while Gradient Echo echo-planar sequence (GRE-EPI) for DSC MRI. DWI was fitted with IVIM bi-exponential model to generate diffusion maps. For each lesion multiple regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn and compared through IVIM and DSC maps.All the post processing evaluations have been done using Olea Sphere software (Olea Medical, La Ciotat, France), statistical analysis was performed with Real Statistic Resource Pack (Microsoft Excel 2010). Result: The computation of tissue perfusion fraction (f-IVIM) has been optimized for each ROI through several steps as motion correction, background suppression, thresholding (0<f-IVIM<0,3) and evaluation of fitting error. The correlation between f-IVIM and rCBV was checked with Pearson coefficient. We found good sensitivity (95,45%) and specificity(83,33%)  in characterization between high and low grade gliomas. On the other hand we experienced that necrotic, haemorrhagic and oedematous intra-tumoural areas as well as liquor affect deeply f-IVIM measurement. Conclusion: Cerebral tissue perfusion fraction (f-IVIM) quantification derived by IVIM analysis it's a new tool, non invasive compared to DSC MRI and potentially useful in gliomas grade discrimination but also in the chemo/radiotherapy follow-up evaluation. However it's necessary to know all the factors that can affect this technique and give feedback to software-house companies in order to improve the available tools for clinical purpose.E.

Belsack 1 , J. De Mey 1 UZ Brussel -Department of Radiology, Brussel, BELGIUMPurpose: To prospectively estimate the incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) after administration of gadoteric acid (DOTAREM\u00ae) in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Methods: A worldwide observational post-marketing study is being conducted to collect safety data of hundreds of patients with moderate to severe and end-stage renal impairment undergoing a routine contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination using gadoteric acid. At inclusion, status of renal function, risk factors, indications for MRI are recorded for each patient. Between 3 and 27 months after contrast-enhanced MRI, three follow-up visits are performed, separated by at least 3 months, in order to detect any occurrence of NSF. Result: As of February 10, 2015, the cut-off date for the interim safety analysis, the data of 512 patients (mean age: 69.5 years [range: 21-95]; male: 59.8%) were available for review. The mean eGFR was 37.3 \u00b115.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (range: 4.0-74.2) and the population included 68.4% of moderate, 16.2% of severe, 12.7% of end-stage renal insufficiency and 2.7% of kidney transplanted patients. Central Nervous System MRI examinations accounted for nearly 33%. To date, 288 patients attended the first follow-up visit (between 3 and 12 months after MRI), 176 patients attended the second follow-up visit (between 13 and 21 months after MRI) and 114 patients the third follow-up visit (between 22 and 27 months after MRI). Only 7 patients (1.4%) had serious adverse events but none of them were related to gadoteric acid.No cases of NSF were reported.

Stulov 1 Bekhterev Psyhoneurological Unstitute, S-Petersburg, RUSSIAPurpose: The aim of our study was comparison of the hyppocampal volumes of healthy volunteers measured using FreeSurfer and DISPLAY postprocessing programs. Methods: 13 healthy volunteers ages from 28 to 51 years (mean age 41) were examined in the 1.5 T MRI scanner (Toshiba Exelart Vantage) using standard brain protocol plus isotropic MPRAGE (0.5 mm). For the postprocessing analysis we used automatic postprocessing program (FreeSurfer, Massachusetts General Hospital) and manual postprocessing program suitable for calculation in three orthogonal planes at the same moment (DISPLAY, Montreal Neurological Institute, Quebec, Canada). Hippocampal volumes were calculated manually by DISPLAY using method proposed by Malykhin N.,2006. Result: Mean volume of the right hippocampus was 3627\u00b1466 mm\u00b3 (DISPLAY), but 4300\u00b1479 mm\u00b3, (FreeSurfer), left hippocampus -3755\u00b1576 mm\u00b3 (DISPLAY), but 4386\u00b1476 mm\u00b3(FreeSurfer). So, the difference between two methods was 14.3-15.6%. Conclusion: This difference can be explained by the effect of partial volume, noises and other technical troubles of automatic postprocessing and accurate use of special 3-plane manual postprocessing data analysis. So we must understand that methods of segmentation have some errors of calculation and it is impossible to compare different segmentation programs with each other.MRI,VOXEL MORPHOMETRY,SEGMENTATIONWhite matter disease EPO:164 D I F F U S I O N K U R T O S I S I M A G I N G I N T H E CHARACTERIZATION OF BRAIN MICROSTRUCTURE CHANGES IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (THE WORK IS FUNDED BY THE GRANT OF RNF N14-15-00197) A.

Our aim was to assess potential haemodynamic compromise in CAS, with quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT) using QUASAR ASL . Methods: 22 patients with CAS enrolled in the ECST-2 (second European Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) with good quality baseline QUASAR ASL data. CAS severity was assessed on the basis of Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography. The vascular territories of Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA), Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA), Anterior and Posterior Border-Zones (ABZ, PBZ) were outlined on anatomical images, then transposed to measure CBF and ATT on corresponding maps. ABZ and PBZ angles were measured on functional ATT maps. Spearmann correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were calculated (significant p-values<0.05). Result: Overall, the mean CBF of ACA, MCA, PCA territories was >40ml/min/100g, without significant inter-territorial differences; ACA Purpose: Optic nerve and optic chiasm are best imaged with MRI. The better the MRI protocol the best the result. We propose an overview of different abnormalities of the anterior optic pathways according to clinical data and selected sequences. Methods: Patients (adults and children) presenting with optic nerve and optic chiasm (AOP) impairment (visual loss, visual field alteration papilledema) underwent MRI examination. Among all the examination performed during the last 3 years, we selected those demonstrating abnormalities. MRI was performed on a Philips 3T ingenia. Patients were asked to keep their eyes shut. Protocol associated thin coronal T2 WI (2mm) and T1 post gadolinium FATSAT WI (3 mm ) focused on the AOP and brain 3D FLAIR and 3DT1 post gadolinium study. Complementary sequences such as diffusion, axial FATSAT T1 post gadolinium and T2 WI, PDW axial sequence, SWI or T2 GE, and MRA were added depending on the first images and clinical data. MRI were analyzed by two experts and abnormalities selected according to their shape, signal and location. Result: The most frequent AOP abnormalities described were HS T2, focal enhancement , atrophy, enhancement of the perioptic meningeal sheet. Dilatation of the perioptic CSF layer,compression of the nerve or the chiasm were more seldom. Rare hypertrophic optic chiasm was predominant on children. Purpose: Advanced diffusion MRI models such as Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) have been recently developed to overcome DTI limitations. NODDI provides multiple compartmental fractions for a richer description of tissue microstructural properties. In this work we present the use of a single color-coded map to represent the information derived by NODDI. Methods: A two-shell NODDI protocol was implemented on 3T Siemens Skyra (30 directions at b=1000 s/mm2 and 60 directions at b=2000 s/mm2) and 3T Philips Achieva (35 directions at b=711 s/mm\u00b2 and 60 directions at b=3000 s/mm\u00b2) and applied in several clinical contexts including demyelinating disease (i.e. multiple sclerosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), tumor (i.e. low-and high-grade gliomas, lymphomas), stroke and toxic/metabolic diseases (i.e. hyperosmolarity injury). Diffusion datasets were fitted to the NODDI model in MATLAB. NODDI decomposes the signal of a voxel in three-compartments: neurites, extra-neurite and isotropic Gaussian diffusion. We created a single RGB color-coded map of the three-compartment model (red for extra-neurite, green for neurites and blue for isotropic Gaussian diffusion), in which the relative contributions of the different microstructural compartments could be easily appreciated. Result: The NODDI color map provides a simple and effective way to visualize the relative weight of each compartment. In multiple sclerosis NODDI color map enables better visual assessment of the underlying microstructural changes in normal appearing white matter as well as within lesions. In brain tumors, the NODDI color map better illustrates the tumor extension and different components within apparently homogeneous lesions on FLAIR: cystic/necrotic and infiltrative tumor 1 Neuroimaging Lab, Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Bosisio Parini, ITALY, 2 Functional Neurorehabilitation Unit, Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Bosisio Parini, ITALY, 3 Child Psychopathology",
