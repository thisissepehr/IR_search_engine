We thus evaluated whether a genotypic analysis of coreceptor tropism impacts on HIV-related markers such as CD4-cell counts. Methods: 960 HIV-1 B subtype infected patients (all maravirocnaive) with an available V3 sequence were analyzed. Tropism determination was performed by using Geno2Pheno algorithm. All V3 mutations, including the mutations used for tropism prediction (Sing T et al., Antiviral Therapy 2007), with prevalence [1% were considered. The associations of CD4 cell counts with false positive rate (FPR) ranges and V3 mutations were evaluated by Mann-Whitney test, Chi-squared test for trend and Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to identify results that were statistically significant in the presence of multiplehypothesis testing. A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Overall, 26% of patients (either drug-naive or drug-experienced) were infected by X4 tropic viruses (using the classical 10% FPR cutoff). Among patients with available CD4 cell-counts at V3 genotypic test, 321 were drug-naive and 490 drug-experienced (median [IQR] cells/mm 3 , p = 0.004). CD4 cell-count \\200 cells/mm 3 was observed in 80 drug-naive patients and in 169 drug-experienced patients.

Mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) internalize HIV through DC-SIGN and, on arrival to lymphoid tissues, transmit the virus in trans to CD4 T lymphocytes, promoting HIV dissemination. DC-SIGN, thus, is a potential therapeutic target and the inhibition of HIV interaction with DC-SIGN may efficiently prevent the early stages of HIV infection. The DC-SIGN ligand is the HIV gp120 high mannose glycan Man9. We synthesized structural analogues of this glycan (using polyvalent presentations of di-and tri-mannoside mimics) in the attempt to compete with binding of DC-SIGN to HIV gp120. Methods: Different experimental models were designed: (1) inhibition of trans infection was assessed by using B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells. Ability of compounds to block lab and primary HIV-1 strains transmission to CD4 T cells was evaluated; (2) human endocervical explant tissues were treated with the compounds and then exposed to different HIV-1 strains in a non polarised manner. Infection was determined by measuring p24 levels in co-culture and in explant culture supernatants; (3) cytokines and chemokines production following stimulation of monocyte-derived DCs was analyzed. Toxicity of the compounds was evaluated in cellular and tissue models. Results: One of the compounds tested, a tetravalent dendron containing four copies of a linear trimannoside mimic (compound 12), almost completely ([98%) abrogated the transmission of R5-and X4-tropic HIV-1 lab strains and primary isolates to CD4 T cells at 100 lM. Notably the antiviral effect persisted up to 12 h after compound removal. Compound 12 also prevented, in a dose-response manner, HIV-1 infection of human cervical tissues under conditions which mimic compromised epithelial integrity. Treatment with this compound significantly increased MIP-1alpha production as well. Toxicity of compound 12 was neglectable at the highest concentration tested in infection assay. Conclusion: Compound 12, a tetravalent dendron presenting trimannoside mimic, is endowed with a potent anti HIV activity independent of viral tropism. The activity is long-lasting and observed both when CD4 T lymphocytes or cervical explants are used. Competition with the binding of HIV to DC-SIGN and stimulation of MIP-1alpha production both contribute to such activity. This compound is potentially suitable for development as a vaginal microbicide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Background: There is limited knowledge on the effects of raltegravir (RAL)-including regimens on proviral HIV load and whether proviral changes in CD4+ T cells may provide additional information over RNA changes in treated patients. Methods: Patients receiving new RAL-including regimens after failure of a previous therapy were prospectively followed. Those with samples stored at baseline and after at least 48 weeks of therapy were included in the study. PBMC were analyzed by a FACS-can flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). CD4+ T cells, positively purified from PBMC (Miltenyi), were lysed and HIV DNA quantified with real time PCR. Slopes were estimated by univariable linear regression analysis; Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were also calculated. Results: Thirty-eight patients, 84% males, median (IQR) age 48 (45-53) years, fulfilled inclusion criteria. At baseline (BL) their CD4+ counts, HIV RNA, HIV DNA were 250 (165-355)/mcL, 3.97 (3.76-4.97) log 10 copies/mL, and 5,090 (3,004-1,1074) copies/106 CD4+ cells, respectively. After a median follow-up of 24 (22) (23) (24) (25) A survey of HIV coreceptor usage in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma in na\u00efve seropositive patients was conducted. One hundred of patients were enrolled, of these 36 had a primary or recent infection (P-RI), 31 an early chronic infection ([350 CD4 cells) (ECI) and 33 a late chronic infection (LCI). Seventy-seven patients harboured the R5 virus in plasma and had a significantly higher median and percentage of CD4+ T cells compared to patients with X4 virus (437 and 281 cells/ll, p = 0.0086; 20.6 and 18.6%; respectively). The X4 strain was detected more frequently in patients with LCI than with P-RI or ECI (39.3, 19.4 and 9.6%, respectively, p = 0.0063). PBMC and plasma tropism was concordant in 90 patients, and 73 had the R5 strain. Among discordant patients, four had the R5 virus in their plasma and the X4 virus in PBMCs; six showed the opposite profile. Plasma, PBMC and CSF tropism determinations were concordant in 26/33 patients (21 R5 and 5 X4). The tropism was discordant in 5/33 patients, with the X4 virus in plasma and R5 in CSF; the HIV tropism in PBMCs was X4 in 3 patients. The remaining 2/33 patients had the R5 virus in plasma and PBMCs and the X4 virus in CSF; one of these patients had PRI. The discordant tropism in CSF and blood may have implications for CCR5 antagonist use in patients with limited response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) or in responding patients evaluated for simplification of treatment. Objective: The peculiar viral population in a slow progressor carrying CRF02-AG HIV-1 virus with several stop codons in the RT gene was analyzed. A role for the T-cell response in the selection of replication-deficient variants was investigated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1088, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1093, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Methods: The proportion of mutant and wild-type RT sequences was determined by clonal analysis of HIV-1 DNA and RNA from blood samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture supernatants. In addition, recombinant HIV-1 strains were generated by reverse genetics to evaluate the replicative capacity of different RT variants in PBMC cultures. The HIV-1-specific memory CD8+ T-cell response was investigated using a peptide-based cultured ELISPOT assay. Conclusion: In vivo selection of multiple stop codons in the RT gene resulted in the accumulation of replication-defective virus strains. Nevertheless, the observed assembly and release of defective viral particles in plasma was probably the result of viral protein complementation between replication-competent and replicationincompetent HIV-1 variants. Interestingly, the divergence in the proportion of RTSTOP and RTFL variants as well as in the pattern of mutations to antiretroviral drug resistance between HIV-1 plasma RNA and circulating PBMC proviral DNA sequences, suggested the possibility that replication-competent and -incompetent virus particles might be assembled and released from lymphatic tissues through a trans-complementation mechanism, while circulating lymphocytes expressing full-length RT might be negatively selected for by specific T-cell response, possibly slowing progression to AIDS in this patient. These results suggest a role for a peptidespecific immunologic response in the positive selection of cells expressing the truncated HIV-1 RT and the accumulation of replication-deficient viral variants in plasma. The antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response could be exploited to redirect the response to HIV-1 infection toward in vivo selection of viral variants with reduced or abolished pathogenicity. One of the best-characterized mechanisms of RNA editing is the conversion of adenosine into inosine (A-to-I) mediated by the Adenosine DeAminase enzymes or ADARs that act on doublestranded RNA. In mammals, three different ADAR enzymes have been identified: ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3 [1] . Inosine acts as guanosine during both splicing and translation events, therefore A-to-I editing within pre-mRNA can alter both splicing patterns and amino acid sequence with important consequences in the final function of the coded protein [1] . ADARs can target viruses, as suggested by numerous reports showing A-to-I changes identified in viral genomes or transcripts that are consistent with editing mediated by these enzymes [1] . So far little effort has been dedicated to testing the involvement of ADARs in the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 RNAs contain several double stranded regions, some of them critical for the different steps of the viral life cycle such as the Rev responsive element (RRE), transactivation responsive element (TAR), and dimerization domain (DIS) [2] that could be possible ADARs substrates. Recently we provided evidence of a role for ADAR1 and ADAR2 in the regulation of some critical steps of the HIV-1 life cycle [3, 4] . We demonstrated that over-expressed ADAR1 and ADAR2 strongly increase the overall accumulation of HIV-1 proteins in producer cells independently of their editing activity. Through their RNA editing activity, both enzymes enhance the release of progeny virions from the producer cells. Of note, only the ADAR1-mediated editing increases the infectious potential of the virus. Finally, we demonstrated that both enzymes edit adenosines within the 5 0 UTR of viral transcripts, but only ADAR1 edits specific adenosines within the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Therefore, ADAR2 and ADAR1 share some but not all the functions that positively regulate HIV-1 replication. Importantly, down-regulation of ADAR2 in Jurkat cells significantly impairs viral replication. Future investigations are necessary to understand the impact of ADARs in the HIV-1 life cycle. This study, by providing further insight into the role of the ADAR enzymes in stimulating the sequence diversification and replication of HIV-1, will possibly help the disclosure of novel targets for antiviral intervention.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2079, "end": 2082, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2328, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2515, "end": 2518, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2897, "end": 2902, "text": "(DIS)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3073, "end": 3076, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3077, "end": 3079, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Prague. 56% of all HIV+ MSM were not aware of their serostatus.

People entering and leaving facilities before the application of the instrument every summer have not been evaluated by. The people in Daily Centres reach better evaluations in many indicators than average of the total sample. On a scale of 0-3 scores, 64.5% people in daycare facilities achieved a score of 2 or 3 in physical condition items versus 54.5% total. Also they seem to be able to put into play some more personal resources to cope with the disease (59.6 versus 53.5%). Obviously the presence of adequate housing is first of all what makes possible the daily attendance, rather than having to be accommodated in a residential service, but also it's important the supporting presence of affective and relational network available for 61.5% of the Day care guests versus 44.8% of the total. The great difficulty to gain employment perspectives hamper the possibilities of people's autonomy as in Family homes as in Day care centres. The location of the guests in the quadrants of the C.E.R.C.A.Re. graphic instrument reflects the variety of the population to whom residential and semi-residential services are addressed and the complex clinical and social needs and care to which they respond. Background: Virus transmission via heterosexual intercourses among migrants represents about 40% out of all new HIV infections due to sexual intercourses in Europe. Italian data, provided by the AIDS Operational Centre of the Italian National Institute of Health, confirm an increase of new HIV infection diagnosis among migrants, raised from 11% in 1992 to 31.6% in 2008; heterosexual intercourses among foreign people are the most common mode of transmission (55.2%) and in particular the proportion of migrants who have been infected through sexual intercourses passes from 24.6% in 1992 to 64.3% in 2008. Another key point, provided by the COA, is the increase in the proportion of foreigners among TB and AIDS co-infection cases, which passed from 10.8% in 1993 to 76.9% in 2009. Socio-economic conditions, different cultural approaches to infectious diseases and major difficulties in accessing appropriate treatments, are risk factors for isolation among HIV positive migrants. The European guidelines for surveillance and prevention of the most vulnerable groups, suggest to conduct a pilot study to get the following data among migrants: knowledge of HIV/AIDS, STD and TB, % of access to HIV test with respect to gender, race, age, education, how long they have been staying in Italy, social integration, how the test has been proposed, access to prevention programs and information about HIV/STD/TB, behaviors adopted to prevent infection (in particular use of condom), HIV prevalence, proportion of recent infections among the new HIV diagnosis, evaluation of circulating HIV subtypes.

Background: miRNAs inhibit viral expression by either modulating host innate immunity or by directly interfering with viral mRNAs. However cellular miRNA expression may also favor virus infection. Previously, we demonstrated that miRNA expression may discriminate between HIV-1 infected and exposed but negative individuals. These findings suggested that miRNA profile could be the result not only of a productive infection, but also of the exposure to HIV products that leave a signature in immune cells. Here, we investigated the miRNA expression profile in CD4+ T cells after exposure to gp120 or after in vitro infection by HIV isolates. Methods: CD4+ cells were isolated from a pool of six healthy subjects. The expression levels of 377 miRNAs were selectively analyzed in CD4+ T cells exposed to gp120 (recombinant or natural proteins) or infected in vitro with HIV strains. MiRNAs extraction was performed by the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) and their expression was subsequently examined by real-time PCR-based arrays. Significant differences in expression of miRNAs were evaluated using a linear mixed effects model of two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Results: Exposure to recombinant and natural gp120 molecules induced the modulation of 43 and 51 miRNAs, respectively. Expression levels of 28 miRNAs were altered by both molecules. The remaining miRNAs showed a non comparable expression presumably due to different molecular structure of the two tested gp120. When the gp120 action was neutralized with specific mAbs, about 1/3 of altered miRNAs were reverted to the expression of controls. Presumably, the expression of these reverted miRNAs could be altered by gp120 through the CD4-mediated signaling. Five reverted miRNAs (34c-5p, 518f, 452, 202, 487b) , which expression may be related to CD4/gp120 binding site, were also found altered at the same expression level after in vitro infection of CD4+ lymphocytes. Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that the exposure to HIV antigen (e.g., gp120) can be enough to induce a marked alteration of miRNA patterns and consequently may influence immune function of CD4+ T cells.

The aim of the study was to investigate whether an integrated proteomic and immunohistochemical approach may discriminate proteins expression profile between HIV+ and HIV-DLBCL patients with good clinical response upon R-CHOP. Methods: Two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was used to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in affected lymph nodes from eight patients (5 HIV-and 3 HIV+) with DLBCL experiencing a good clinical response upon R-CHOP at 5 years follow-up. Immunohistochemistry was applied for analysis of selected proteins in tumor tissues. Results: Data analysis by 2D-DIGE showed a limited number (23/250 analyzed, \\10%) of differentially expressed proteins (p = 0.05) in HIV+ versus HIV-DLBCL patients. Difference spans ranged from a maximum of 3.53 times (anti-trypsin) to a minimum of -2.91 times (serpin).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be involved in the rate of HIV disease progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of polymorphisms located in IL-7 and IL-15 and their cognate receptor genes in HIV disease progression. Methods: We genotyped 91 antiretroviral treated patients (progressors) and 121 long term non progressors (LTNP) using a real time PCR methodology. We analyzed five polymorphisms in IL-7R, one in IL-7, three in IL-15R and two in IL-15 genes. We evaluated cell surface receptor expression by means of cytometry. Results: In univariate analysis, we found an association between the presence of at least one mutated allele A in the IL-15R SNP rs2228059 and a higher possibility of being LTNP (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1. 13-3.85 vs. CC, p = 0.019); as well as the presence of at least one mutated allele G and lack of disease progression (AOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.34-3.94 vs. CC, p = 0.003). In a multivariate model the presence of at least one mutated allele G in IL-7R SNP rs3194051 or A in IL-15R rs2228059 was associated to the condition of non progression (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.33-3.99 vs. CC, p = 0.003 and OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.11-3.69 vs. CC, p = 0.022, respectively). The co-presence of two favourable alleles in IL-15R and in IL-7R determined a higher association with non progression (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.47-4.52 vs. allele C+ allele G, p = 0.001). We therefore analyzed IL-15R expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells according to the genotype of SNP rs2228059 and found a significantly increased expression from wild type to heterozygous to mutated homozygous. Other SNP were not linked to disease progression. Conclusions: Our study suggests that genetic polymorphisms located in IL-7R and IL-15R genes can influence the rate of disease progression in HIV+ patients, especially when a combination of aplotypes is present. SNP rs2228059 is able to influence IL-15 receptor expression. Taking into consideration the role of IL-15 as a growth factor for T cells and NK cells and the conserved functionality of CD8 T cells in LTNP, we speculate that this IL-15R SNP could contribute to long lasting protection from HIV disease progression through increased IL-15 receptor expression determining higher activity of cytotoxic CD8 T cells and/or NK cells. Cattedra di Malattie Infettive, Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; 2 Ospedale di Schio, Vicenza, Italy; 3 Dipartimento di istologia, microbiologia e biotecnologie, Universita`di Padova, Padua, Italy Background: Increased levels of activated T cells are a hallmark of the chronic stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and are highly correlated with HIV disease progression. The clinical significance of persistent residual viremia in patients on prolonged highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not clear and the effect of low-level viremia on T-cell homeostasis is still debated. This study was designed to investigate the correlation between markers of immune-activation and low levels of HIV viremia in HAART treated patients. Methods: Twenty-four patients responder to HAART were enrolled in the study. A strict monitoring of HIV viremia was conducted during a 2 year period. Twelve patients resulted persistently HIV-RNA undetectable (less of 50 cp/ml) and 12 presented transient lowdetectable viremia ('blips') (below 1,000 cp/ml). The mean time of treatment was 29 and 23 months, respectively, for the two groups with a median in CD4 gain of 409 and 364 cells/ml, respectively. Evaluation of lymphocyte phenotype was performed by flow cytometric and multiparameter analysis on total lymphocytes, T helper and suppressor lymphocytes (naive and memory), B cells, NK cells and regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25-CD127). Results: No differences in demographic parameters were found between the two groups. In patients with viral blips the number of HLA-DR+CD3 lymphocytes were higher (p = 0.03) than in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viremia. Both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes expressed HLA-DR antigens. Patients with HIV viremia persistently under 50 cp/ml had a significant (p = 0.04) higher percentage of CD4+ compared to patients with viral blips. Analyzing the subgroup of 12 patients with a stable undetectable viremia, significant higher number of HLA-DR+CD3 (p = 0.003) was present in 6 patients with[30 cp/ml than in those with\\30 cp/ml. No differences were found among the different groups of subjects in regard to the expression of CD25 and CD127. Conclusion In HAART treated patients with occasional viral blips or with ultrasensitive viremia [30 cp/ml a significant higher numbers of activated CD3+ lymphocytes have been demonstrated compared to patients with low level of residual viremia (\\30 cp/ml). These results suggest that low-level HIV-1 viremia may contribute to persistent T-cell activation and to alter T cell immune response despite HAART.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2814, "end": 2821, "text": "13-3.85", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Background: HIV-infected pts failing immune recovery on virologically-suppressive HAART maintain a highly activated/ differentiated peripheral CD4 pool.

Methods: Pts on HAART with CD4\\200/lL and HIV-RNA\\50 cp/ mL were randomized to: HAART+MVC (A) or continuing HAART (B). Na\u00efve CD45RA+62L+, memory CD45RA-, central-memory CD127+, activated/proliferating HLA-DR+CD38+Ki67+CD4/CD8, plasma IL-7 were quantified. HIV-RNA was quantified via Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Kit v1.5, followed by RT-PCR. Results: 66/100 pts were analyzed at week 12 (W12): 39 in A; 27 in B. At baseline, comparable total CD4 and immune-phenotypes were shown between arms. By W12, both study groups displayed a significant increase in CD4 (A: 184-230, p \\ .001; B: 165-190, p = .037) . A statistically significant change in mean CD8 (p = .002) was observed between pts in arm A and B. HIV-RNA remained \\50 cp/mL with no difference between arms. The immunephenotype of reconstituting CD4 was different between arms. Whereas HAARTcontrols displayed a rise in memory CD4 (53-70%, p = .05) with a contraction of naive T-cells (CD4, 24-9%, p = .02; CD8, 20-9%, p = .028), MVC-receiving patients maintained stable memory T-cells (CD4, 35-45%, p = .14; CD8, 35-38%, p = .08) with a non-significant rise in naive CD4 (17-37%, p = .3) and CD8 (11-36%, p = .3). Interestingly, MCV resulted in a significantly higher proportion of na\u00efve CD4 compared to controls (p = .03), whereas controls tended to have higher memory CD4 (p = . 08). Both MVC and HAART resulted in the decline of activated HLA-DR+CD38+ T-cells (A: p = .03, p = .03; B: p = .009, p = .038 for CD4 and CD8, respectively). Despite no changes in Ki67+CD4/CD8 in both groups, MVCreceiving pts displayed significantly lower proliferating Ki67+CD4 at W12 (18 vs. 23% p = .04). As for the IL-7/IL-7R, only MVCreceiving patients presented an increasing trend in central-memory CD127+CD4 by W12 (56-60%, p = .058), with no change in CD127 + CD8 and circulating Conclusions: In HIV-infected subjects with inefficient immune reconstitution on virologically-suppressive HAART, intensification with MVC results in a significant expansion of na\u00efve CD4 pool that proliferates less actively. This suggests a reduction in peripheral T-cell death and preserved T-cell production, with possible improvement in immune competence. Background: Pluripotent MSCs were isolated in the adventitia and in subendothelial region of vessels and can be differentiated towards several cell lineages such as endothelial cells, osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. Hence, these cells may be a target of HIV and/or viral proteins inducing direct or indirect induction of vessel damages. We have focused our attention on two main aspects represented by the direct effects of HIV-1 challenge and gp120 treatment on primary vessel wall MSCs and the impact of viral action on MSC differentiation towards specific lineages. Materials and methods: Human arterial segments of femoral arteries from three male heart-beating donors were harvested, processed for immunohistochemical examination and used for cell isolation. The characterization of isolated cells, as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), was carried out through flow cytometry procedure and multi-differentiation potential analysis. The apoptotic cells were analyzed on primary sub-confluent MSCs challenged with HIV-1 strains, hi HIV-1 strains or gp120. PPARg transcription factor activity was detected by TransAM PPARg kit. The data are expressed as mean + standard deviation (SD) of three separate experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student's t test. Results: R5 and X4 HIV-1 laboratory strains were challenged with MSCs determining that these strains are able to entry and integrate their retrotranscribed proviral DNA in the host cell genome. HIV-1 strains, recombinant gp120 (rgp120) and heat-inactivated HIV-1 strains elicited a reliable increase of apoptosis in subconfluent MSCs through the interaction between rgp120 and cell membrane. We have challenged HIV-1 strains, rgp120 and heat-inactivated HIV-1 strains on MSCs differentiated to adipogenesis and endotheliogenesis displaying that the adipogenesis is increased especially through the PPARg activity up-regulation whereas the endothelial differentiation, induced by VEGF treatment, was clearly impaired by the same treatment with a down-regulation of endothelial markers such as vWF, VEGF-R1 and R2 expression. Discussion: Our study indicate that HIV and recombinant gp120 have a strong direct impact on vessel wall MSC biology and differentiation suggesting a role of viral infection in the vessel damage, atherosclerosis degeneration and adipogenesis induction. Our data suggested an additional mechanism in the damage of endothelial layer involving the MSC role in the vessel homeostasis. HIV affects the MSC biology acting both on primary MSCs and MSCs differentiated to adipocyte and endothelial cells. In addition, the impairment of MSC differentiation is noteworthy because in the atherosclerotic vessel degeneration it is possible remark some peculiar lesions such as cartilaginous metaplasia with endocondral ossification, fat tissues S18", "cite_spans": [{"start": 861, "end": 901, "text": "184-230, p \\ .001; B: 165-190, p = .037)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "ICAR 2011: Abstracts especially in inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms, that might be related to MSC differentiation derangement.

Results: 1,042 patients were screened; 38 were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete data. 1,004 patients (76% males) with a mean age of 46.2 years (SD 8) were enrolled.

Background: In recent years, the importance of bone disease as noninfectious comorbidity involving younger and older HIV-infected individuals has increased. The development of reliable and low cost methods to identify and monitor bone alterations in HIV+ patients is an area of active investigation. Recent data in normal population suggest that bone mineral quality (BMQ), assessed by a quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) could be an early marker of osteopenia/ osteoporosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Objective: To investigate bone health assessment in HIV-infected adults using QUS technique and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and, in addition, to compare the data with viro-immunologic parameters and vitamin D levels. Methods: 37 HIV-infected patients and 44 HIV-negative controls, matched for sex and age, were enrolled. Bone health was measured using classical dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of spine and hip and calcaneal QUS. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) and quantitative ultrasound index (QUI)/ stiffness index (SI) were assessed by QUS. Data were correlated with CD4+ count, HIV load, years of disease, immune activation markers (DR+CD38+CD4+ and DR+CD38+CD8+), 25OH vitamin D. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and Spearman correlation were used for statistical analysis. Results: 5 patients were viremic (ARV-na\u00efve) and 32 were virologically ARV-suppressed. 17 patients were treated with PI-based regimen and 16 with NNRTI regimen. A significant decrease of QUI/ SI parameters was found in HIV-infected patients in comparison to control (83.4 \u00b1 4.9; 99.7 \u00b1 2.5, p = 0.014). An inverse correlation between QUI and age in HIV+ patients was seen (r = -0.38; p = 0.047). In particular, the highest difference in QUI parameters was found in HIV+ patients aged[48 years (p = 0.012). Moreover, a strong correlation between QUI and DEXA values was observed (p = 0.001). Comparable QUS parameters were found between NNRTI-and PI-based therapies. No difference was seen in patients treated with TDF. No difference was observed between HIV+ subjects and controls for vitamin D levels which were decreased in both groups. In HIV+ people, we found a significant correlation between vitamin D level and age (p = 0.022), and between vitamin D and years of infection (p = 0.0142). No correlation was found between QUS and CD4 nadir, as well as between QUS and immune activation markers. Conclusions: QUS has been introduced in the medical field for the study of bone tissue in normal population to identify changes in the tissue that could suggest the presence of osteoporosis and bone fragility. Our data in HIV-infected people suggest that the measurement of QUS parameters might be an additional, simple and inexpensive technique to monitor bone status and identify early signs of bone damage. Background: Antiretrovirals (ARVs) penetration and effectiveness in the central nervous system have been shown to be related to the extent of HIV suppression in this sanctuary site. Drug chemical properties as well as blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity influence the passage to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Alterations in the BBB are common during the course of HIV infection but few is known on the effect of such modifications on the CSF-to-plasma ratios of ARVs. Methods: Samples from patients undergoing lumbar punctures for clinical reasons were analyzed for BBB integrity indexes (Albumin, IgG and Tourtelotte); concomitant plasma and CSF concentrations were collected using a sparse sampling strategy and measured with validated HPLC-MS methods. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range); Spearman's analysis were used to test association between variables.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Results: Eighteen patients on antiretroviral treatment containing Truvada \u00d2 were included in this analysis. Median age and BMI were 39 years (35-50) and 22 kg/m 2 (20.4-24.8); 44.4% of them were male. Samples were collected 14-26 h after drug intake; concomitant drugs were mostly boosted protease inhibitors (69.2%) and NNRTIs (23%). BBB integrity was altered in eight (44.4%) of the patients with albumin and IgG ratios ranging respectively from 2.4 to 19.5 and 1.8 to 22. Tenofovir and emtricitabine CSF-to-plasma ratios were 0.05 (0-0.14) and 0.37 (0-0.48); the two ratios were significantly related to each other (q = 0.83, p = 0.002). Both drug ratios were significantly correlated to the albumin CSF-to-plasma indexes (respectively q = 0.57 with p = 0.017 and q = 0.57 with p = 0.05). Conclusion: Tenofovir and emtricitabine passage to the CSF were similar to the reported ones and they were apparently related to each other: patients with higher ratios of one drug showed higher ratios of the other one. This observation, though predictable from the chemical properties of the two drugs, could hint for pharmacogenetic differences or alterations in the blood-brain-barrier integrity. The association between these drugs and albumin CSF-to-plasma ratios suggest that disruption in the BBB could partially explain the observed variability in the cerebrospinal penetration of antiretrovirals. Background: HIV-1 replication in CSF despite viral suppression in plasma has been associated with neurocognitive impairment and neurological symptoms. Higher CPE ranking (2010 version) was related to lower proportion of detectable CSF viral load and to longer time-to-loss-of-viral response in CSF, even if predictive value of CPE ranking according to level of HIV-1 suppression in plasma is still unclear. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of consecutive paired CSF/plasma samples from HIV infected patients followed at four clinical centers in Italy. Plasma and CSF lower limit of quantification were defined by standard methods at the time of sample collection (range 50-200 cp/ mL). Predictive value of covariates associated with HIV-RNA undetectable in CSF were assessed by multivariate linear regression method. Results: A total of 301 paired CSF/plasma samples collected from 219 HIV-infected patients treated by cART (years 1999-2009) Background: Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD), the overall prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) has increased. Since treatment and prevention of HAND is becoming an increasing concern, management strategies for cognitive impairment in patients living with HIV are expected to play an important role in the near future. We performed a survey on management strategies in Italian HIV Clinics. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional survey among Italian HIV Clinics using a standardized questionnaire. Investigated variables included: number of HIV-infected patients attending the Clinic, diagnostic tools for HAND (i.e. neuroimaging, virological and neuroimmunological equipments, neuropsychological testing, screening tools for cognitive impairment and psychiatric comorbidities), and management strategies. Results: At the present writing, a total of 24 questionnaires from 24 HIV Clinics, were examined. Overall, the reported number of HIVinfected patient receiving HAART attending the HIV Clinics examined was 13.916, corresponding to an estimated 23% of the Italian HIV-infected population currently treated. The availability of selected diagnostic tools for HAND in the 24 investigated HIV Clinics was as follows: brain MRI 23 HIV Clinics (96%), functional MRI 14 (58%), CSF HIV RNA plus genotypic resistance testing 23 (96%), CSF PCR for opportunistic pathogens 24 (100%), CSF markers of immunoactivation (i.e. MCP-1) 11 (45%), full battery standardized neuropsychological testing 11 (45%), International HIV Dementia Scale (HIDS) 8 (33%), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 11 (45%). Conclusions: The availability of virological and neuroimaging tools did not differ significantly among Italian HIV Clinics. By contrast, relevant differences existed in the accessibility to standardized neuropsychological evaluations and to other diagnostic tools for HAND including IHDS, and MMSE. In particular, the availability of standardized neuropsychological testing was largely underrepresented across the country. Since these diagnostic tools are currently recommended in National and International Guidelines for HAND diagnosis and treatment, efforts are needed to ensure their broader diffusion across the country.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2323, "end": 2340, "text": "(years 1999-2009)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "ICAR 2011: Abstracts Background: Several studies have shown that antiretroviral therapies (ART) can suppress HIV-1 infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), although to varying degrees. However, some reports showed that, despite suppression of viral replication in plasma during ART, persistent viremia can be detected in the CSF. In order to compare the kinetics and magnitude of HIV-1 RNA responses to ART in the CSF and plasma we performed serial lumbar punctures (LPs) in 15 subjects with varying CD4 T lymphocyte depletion and ADC stages after the initiation of therapy. Methods: LPs were performed before and after the initiation of ART (month 1, 3 and 6) in 15 naive HIV-1-infected subjects. HIV-RNA levels in plasma and CSF were detected at each time and residual viremia (\\1 copy/ml) was detected in samples with\\50 copies/ml. The LP was not repeated in patients reaching undetectable level of HIV-RNA in CSF. Genotypic analysis of viral tropism was performed and the generated V3 sequences were then interpreted using geno2pheno website. Results: At start of treatment mean CD4 cell count was 72 cells/ll (range 9-220), plasma HIV-RNA was 5.63 log cps/ml (range 4.19-6.42) and CSF HIV-RNA was 6.25 log cps/ml (range 2.29-7.20) . A X4 variant was detected in three patients in plasma and in one patient in CSF; one patient had a dual tropic virus either in plasma and in CSF. The mean central nervous system penetration-effectiveness (CPE) rank of ART was seven (range 6-10). A follow-up of at least 3 months was obtained in eight patients. Undetectable level of HIV-RNA was obtained in six patient in plasma (after a mean of 2.6 months) and in seven patients in CSF (after a mean of 2.1 months). In these patients the residual viremia was 16.8 cps/ml in plasma and 31.8 cps/ml in CSF. One patient had detectable HIV-RNA in plasma (2.32 log cps/ml) and in CSF (2.18 log cps/ml) after 6 months of therapy. Conclusion: At the start of treatment the viral kinetics in the CSF and plasma are similar. Undetectable levels of HIV-RNA (\\40 cps/ml) have been achieved before in CSF than in plasma. The presence of distinct HIV-1 populations and a higher residual viremia in the CSF than in plasma indicate that independent HIV-1 replication can occur in the central nervous system. Virological, immunological and safety parameters were collected. Primary outcome of the study was virological response (percentage of patients with HIV-RNA\\50 copies/ml) . Results: Sixty-seven patients, 84% males, age 46 (21-74), 16 (8-25) years of HIV-infection were screened in Maraviroc expanded access program. At baseline median CD4+ count was 194 cells/mmc (10-911), 11.8% (1.5-32.7) , HIV-RNA 4.23 log 10 4.23 copies/ml (1.88-5.96 ). ESTA indicated R5 in 40/67 (60%) samples, non-R5 in 25/67 (37%) and not determined in 2/67 (3%). Geno2pheno indicated R5 in 72% and non-R5 in 28% of samples. High concordance (84%) between g2p and ESTA was reached in detection of R5-tropic viruses. Eleven samples were discordant: seven resulted non-R5 by ESTA and R5 by g2p; four R5 by ESTA and non-R5 by g2p. Virological responses were similar between the groups at different timepoints after the initiation of the therapy. Percentage of patients treated with maraviroc and with undetectable viral load is reported in the Discussion: Italian na\u00efve and experienced populations are more frequently susceptible to RPV than to EFV. EFV is a risk factor to develop E138K, while NVP has no effect. A sequencing strategy seems safer when the patient is pre-exposed to NVP than to EFV (except for Y181C/I). A clinical validation of the meaning of these RAMs is needed to understand the real effect of these mutations. Introduction: After the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV-1 infection, longitudinal cohort study represents a gold standard approach to better define the course of disease also in treated populations. Objectives: To assess changes over time in survival following HIVseroconversion (SC) in the era of cART, providing updated survival estimates. Methods: Using data from patients with estimated dates of HIV-SC enrolled in Italian HIV-seroconversion study (IHSS) from 1985 to 2007, we studied time from SC to death from any cause, applying Cox models adjusted for prognostic variables. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the expected survival in different calendar periods considering staggered entries. Results: During the study period, 2,278 patients were considered with 29,824 p-y of follow-up. A total of 644 (28%) deaths were observed. The hazard ratio (HR) of death, compared with the period 1985-1995, decreased over time to 0.51 (95% CI 0.41-0.63), 0.18 (0.14-0.25) and 0.12 (0. 09-0.18) in 1996-1999, 2000-2003 and 2004-2007, respectively Background: Following the introduction of the National HIV Surveillance System in 2008, Emilia-Romagna Region implemented its own system (SorvHIV-RER), with the collaboration of the Infectious Diseases Units working on the regional area. Collected data allowed to examine characteristics of people with a new HIV diagnosis and to analyse risk factors associated with patients presenting at later stages of HIV disease, according to definition of Late Presenters (already AIDS presentation and/or low CD4+ cells count at diagnosis). Methods: Each new HIV diagnosed case, with at least one CD4+ lymphocyte count and a recorded stage of HIV disease, identified among residents in Emilia-Romagna from 2006 and 2009 was included in the observation. Descriptive statistics were used to describe cases characteristics, time trends and spatial distributions. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed to examine factors associated with being Late Presenter patient. Definition used were: Late Presenter (LP), identifying new HIV diagnosis with a CD4 count below 350 cells/lL or presenting with an AIDSdefining event (ADE), regardless of the CD4 cell count and Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) if they had a CD4 count below 200 cells/lL or an ADE, regardless of the CD4 cell count. Results: 1,552 new HIV diagnoses were reported in SorvHIV-RER system during the study period, determining an incidence rate of 9.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Men represented 72.0% of diagnosed cases, the median age was 39 years and the proportion of persons born outside Italy was 29.0%. Sexual transmission occurred in 83.8% of total cases. Out of these, 55.5% was related to heterosexual contacts (HC) and 28.3% to men who have sex with men (MSM). Injecting drug users (IDU) represented 5.5% of all HIV persons. Among all new HIV diagnoses 48.1% were LP and 32.7% were in a condition of AHD. Older age, foreign born and heterosexual transmission represented significant determinants for being classified as a Late Presenter (age per a 5 years increase: OR 1.34, [1.26-1.41 Background: Data on the best vaccination schedule for H1N1 pandemic influenza in HIV-infected adolescents and young adults are lacking. We investigated the immunogenicity of 1 (P1) or 2 (P2) doses of pandemic vaccine given at once with seasonal influenza vaccine in this population.

All patients were vaccinated at once with the 2009/10 trivalent seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. H1N1, A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B antigen specific antibody titres (ABT) were analyzed before immunization and 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate protective ABT (dichotomous [40 U/ L) and their changes (continuous and log-transformed) over time. Treatment, time, squared time, and treatment 9 time were the fixed effects and the patient was the random effect in these regression models. weeks. According to primary study endpoint, there were 5/38 (13.2%) treatment interruption: one death (brain hemorrhage), two reinductions with 2NRTI based on protocol-defined events (1 pregnancy and 1 inadequate ATV concentration) and two VF (both without resistance mutations, undetectable plasma ATV and successfully re-induced with 2NRTI). Median CD4 change was +33 cells/mmc (p = 0.24).Six severe adverse events were recorded (4 renal colic, 1 hypertensive crisis, 1 brain hemorrhage). ATV concentration, total bilirubin, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides did not show significant modifications from BL at 48 weeks, whereas significant changes of total cholesterol (mean +15 mg/dl; p = 0.002), HDL (+6 mg/dl; p \\ 0.001) and GFR (CG: +6 mL/min, p \\ 0.001) were observed.

Conclusion: With current ARV regimens virological failure mostly occurs in the context of optimal self-reported adherence. In this setting, drug interruption was the main risk factor. A protective role was found for longer duration on ARV and increasing number of ARV regimens, suggesting positive effect of switch to more convenient/ tolerable ARV. Translation into clinical practice may suggest comprehensive adherence assessment, alertness during earlier ARV phase, and ARV tailoring. Aim: To assess differences in liver histology and corresponding causative factors between HIV/HCV coinfection and HCV monoinfection. Methods: Liver biopsies (LBs) from 440 consecutive HIV/HCV coinfected patients (Group HIV/HCV) and 374 consecutive HCV monoinfected patients (Group HCV) were evaluated for necroinflammation and fibrosis (Ishak) by a pathology unaware of clinical and laboratory data. All patient were na\u00efve for anti HCV treatment, HBsAg negative and with no history of alcohol abuse; 69.3% of patients in Group HIV/HCV were under an effective HAART at time of liver biopsy. Results: HIV/HCV coinfected patients compared with those HCV monoinfected were younger (38 + 6 vs. 46.2 + 11.6 years, p \\ 0.0001), more frequently males (74.3 vs. 50.2%, p \\ 0.0001) and with HCV-genotype 3 (37 vs. 5.8%, p \\ 0.0001); they showed a good immunological condition (CD4 518 + 266). Patients in Group HIV/ HCV more frequently than those in Group HCV showed fibrosis score [4 (27.5 vs. 20.6%, p \\ 0.05) and necroinflammation score [9 (25.9 vs. 13.4%; p \\ 0.0001). The prevalence of patients with fibrosis [4 increased with the increase of the age both in Group HIV/HCV (p \\ 0.005) and in Group HCV (p \\ 0.05); for necroinflammation (score [9) this increase was found only in Group HIV/HCV (p \\ 0.05). Conclusion: Despite an effective HAART, HIV infection favours the progression of liver fibrosis to its more severe forms. Progression of liver fibrosis significantly increases with the increase of the age both in HIV/HCV coinfection and in HCV monoinfection, suggesting to consider for an early anti-HCV treatment all patients with HCV related chronic hepatitis. Background and aim: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a pathogen that persists in the presence of a readily apparent immune response. It is associated with hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, as mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Moreover, it is noticed an increase in hepatic disease onset in HCV+/ HIV+ coinfected pts with respect to HIV-subjects. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) genes are polygenic and polymorphic. KIRs were present on T/natural killer (T-NK) cells that constitute a major component of innate immune response. Accumulating evidences indicate that KIR/HLA-ligands play an important role in regulating HCV-related and HIV-related malignancies, by performing innate and adaptive immune response. Aim was to investigate KIR/HLA combinations in different HCV-related malignancies with respect to the same malignancies arising in the context of HIV co-infection to establish the role of KIR/HLA genetic interaction in protection or susceptibility to HCV/HIV-disorders. Material and methods: We analyzed KIR/HLA genotypes in a selected population of HCV+HBV-HIV-pts with HCC (26 pts), NHL (68), MC (55), chronic HCV infection (CH, 29) . As the second end point we analyzed KIR/HLA genotypes in similar population's but in HIV+ pts; HCC-HIV+ (2 pts), NHL-HIV+ (15 pts), chronic CH-HIV+ (30 pts). A group of blood donors (BD, 69) was added as representative of the HCV-HIV-general population. Genomic DNA was genotyped for KIR genes and 2DS4 plus 2DL5 variants by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP). HLA was genotyped at high resolution by PCR-sequence based typing (SBT) and analyzed with Assign SBT software. For each patient, functional KIR-HLA combinations were determined. Significant differences among groups were estimated by Fisher's exact test and by using multivariate analyses (GraphPad InStat software). Results: HCC patients without HIV infection were characterized by a less frequency of KIR2DL2 versus BD P = 0.05 and CH P = 0.01, and of KIR2DL5B and KIR2DS2 genes versus CH P = 0.01. Moreover, a lower rate of functional KIR2DL2/C1 and KIR2DS2/C1 combinations were found in HCC to CH, P = 0.05. By converse, HLA class II DR3-DQ3 clusters were found associated to lymphorpoliferative disorders. Data from HIV+ pts were in course. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings indicate that there is specific variation of KIR/HLA frequencies in HCC-HCV+ pts. Results evidence direct T/NK functions towards different HCV-related disorders. Moreover, KIR/HLA result genes with a consistently beneficial determinants in the outcome of HCV infection and consequently protective to HCC development, while persistence of HCV is associated to specific KIR/HLA genetic background and lymphoproliferation. The role of KIR/ HLA host background in the setting of HIV-infection would be determined. Background: Despite the clinical benefits, the long-term antiretroviral therapy is associated with a complex spectrum of untoward metabolic effects, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance and lipodystrophy syndrome. Methods: 28 HIV-positive patients attending the Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at the University of Milan, with HAART-related lipodystrophy and 11 healthy donors (HC) were enrolled in the study. Subcutaneous adipose tissue specimens from the supra-iliac region were obtained using a 4-mm punch biopsy needle. Fat biopsies were rapidly frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C. RNA was extracted using standard methods, the cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystem) following the manufacturer's instructions. We have compared the mRNA expression profile of adipocytes in the Clnica Malattie Infettive, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy Introduction: Raltegravir, the first HIV integrase inhibitor available in clinical practice for the treatment of HIV-infection, has shown a good safety profile. However, muscle alterations ranging from asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increases to rhabdomyolysis and central nervous system symptoms (CNS) have been reported in literature. No study to date has evaluated the possible interactions between muscle and CNS adverse events. Purpose of the study: The purpose of our study was to further investigate the relation between the occurrence of CNS symptoms and muscle alterations in a cohort of patients starting HAART including raltegravir in clinical practice. Methods: The SCOLTA Project is a prospective, observational, multicenter study created to assess the incidence of adverse events in patients receiving new antiretroviral drugs in clinical practice. Muscle symptoms where classified according to the American Heart Association guidelines a CPK elevations were graded according to the Division of AIDS table for grading the severity of adverse events. The presence of CNS symptoms (headache, dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia) were recorded in a standardized form.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3604, "end": 3608, "text": "(CH,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3609, "end": 3612, "text": "29)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Results: A total of 293 HIV-infected patients were included in the present study, 188 (64.2%) males. CDC stage was C in 112 (38.2%) patients. Mean age at enrolment was 44.9 \u00b1 9.1 years, mean CD4 cell count 370 \u00b1 265 cells/lL and mean HIV-RNA 3.17 \u00b1 1.58 log 10 cp/ml; 106 (36.4%) patients were HCV Ab+ and 119 (40.6%) had a diagnosis of lipodystrophy. Fifteen (5.1%) patients were naive to antiretrovirals. After a median follow up of 14 months, 261 (89.1%) patients were still on therapy with raltegravir. The most frequent causes of discontinuation were patient decision/low adherence in eight (2.8%), adverse events in four (1.4%), therapy simplification in four (1.4%), death in four (1.4%) and virological failure in three (1.0%). Overall, 55 (18.8%) patients had muscular events (CPK increases, muscle pain and/or weakness) and 36 (12.2%) reported at least one CNS symptom. No therapy discontinuation was caused by muscle symptoms, CPK elevations or CNS symptoms. Patients with CNS symptoms were significantly (p \\ 0.0001) more likely to report muscle symptoms (10/17, 57.8%) than those without CNS toxicity (26/276, 9.4%) . Furthermore, patients with CNS symptoms had a significantly (p = 0.004) higher frequency (13/36, 36 .1%) of all muscular events than patients without CNS alterations (42/257, 14.3%). Conclusions: Muscle and CNS symptoms occurred frequently in patients receiving raltegravir but were not associated with therapy discontinuation. The occurrence of CNS symptoms appeared to be strongly related with muscle toxicity, in our cases. This observation, even if preliminary, could suggest a higher exposure to raltegravir in such patients, given the high CNS penetration of the drug. Our data suggest that patients with CNS symptoms should be probably monitored more frequently for muscle toxicity. Background: Several studies, based on men predominating cohorts, have reported an increasing incidence of NADM in HIV-positive patients in recent years. Fewer data are available on the spectrum and incidence of NADM in HIV-positive women. The aim of our study was to examine trends in the spectrum, incidence, and survival associated with NADM in a cohort of HIV-positive men and women during periods preceding and following the introduction of HAART. Methods: A retrospective analysis included all incident NADM occurring from 1985 to 2008 in a cohort of 5,920 HIV-positive patients. Spectrum, incidence rates and survival of NADC were compared between pre- (1985-1996) and post-(1997-2008) HAART periods. Incidence rates were examined by Poisson regression models. Standardized incidence ratios compared cancer risk in HIV-infected subjects with that in the general population (Milan Cancer Report). Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Among 5,920 patients (4,389 males and 1,541 females) who contributed 46.873 person-years follow up, there were 117 new NADM diagnosis (25 in the pre-HAART period and 92 in the post-HAART period). The overall incidence rate increased from 1.0 cases/ 1,000 py in the pre-HAART to 4.1 cases/1,000 py in the post-HAART period (p \\ 0.01). Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and lung carcinoma were the most frequent NAMD in both periods (14 and 30 cases, and 6 and 19 cases respectively). A significant expansion in the spectrum of NAMD was observed in the post-HAART period. Of the most common NADM observed in women, risks were higher than expected for cancer of the vulva (SIR, 96.4; 95% CI 25.9-246.7), ovary (SIR, 6.5; 95% CI 1.3-18.9), lung (SIR, 6.0; 95% CI 1.2-17.5), and for HD (SIR, 8.6; 95% CI 1.0-31.2). In men risks were higher than expected for cancer of anus (SIR, 82.8; , liver (SIR, 6.2; 95% CI 3.2-10.8), tongue (SIR, 5.7; 95% CI 1.2-16.7), lung (SIR, 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-4.1), and HL (SIR, 14.3; 95% CI 9.4-21.0). Five-year survival after NADM diagnosis did not differ between pre-and post-HAART periods (33.6 and 40.7%, respectively; p = 0.304). No difference in survival was observed according to gender. On the contrary, older age and chronic HCV infection were significantly associated with mortality, while CD4 cell count at diagnosis (univariate analysis) and antineoplastic treatment were predictive of better survival. Conclusions: Rates and spectrum of NAMD increased over time within our cohort. Several NAMD, especially those associated with infections and smoking, occurred at rates significantly higher than expected both in men and in women. High mortality rates for NAMD persist in the HAART period and this highlights the need for early diagnosis, use of highly active antiviral treatments and prospective surveillance. Background: HIV/HPV coinfected women have an increased risk of developing SIL (squamous intraepithelial lesions) and cervical cancer. The aim of this study is to value the prevalence of HPV highly oncogenic subtypes in a cohort of HIV women from Naples area, to verify if HPV DNA cervical expression is associated with cervical cytological abnormalities and to assess if HAART can reduce the prevalence of HPV related SIL and other cytological abnormalities in cervical tract. Methods: We collected 170 cervical cytological samples from 170 HIV infected women. On all Pap smears samples a cytological diagnosis was performed. HPV DNA status and oncogenic HPV subtypes were assessed using the Hybrid Capture II \u00d2 . Data regarding HIV RNA plasma levels, CD4+ count and HAART of all patients were analyzed. Statistical evaluations were performed using v 2 test. Results: Median age of 170 enrolled HIV women was 36 years (range 22-55). 50% were Africans, 38% Italians, 9% East Europeans and 3% South-Americans. Of all 170 vaginal specimens tested, 95 (60%) were found positive for HPV DNA. Of these 95, 78 (82%) resulted positive for one or more highly oncogenic HPV subtypes. Only in 17/95 low risk oncogenic subtypes (p \\ 0.001) were detected. Among 78 women with highly oncogenic subtypes 50 (64%) had CD4 \\200/ mmc (p \\ 0.001) and 29 (37%) had a HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load [90,000 cp/mL (p \\ 0.01). Of all 170 enrolled patients, 94 (55%) had cytological abnormalities (15 H-Sil, 72 L-Sil, 3 CIN 1, 2 CIN 2-3 and 2 cervical cancers), but only 58/94 (62%) presented an association with cervical HPV DNA (p = 0.002). Of 94 women with abnormal Pap smears, 45 (48%) were not in HAART, whereas 49 (52%) were treated with HAART (65% PI-based, 30% NNRTI-based, 5% other antiretroviral combinations). However, cytological abnormalities associated with highly oncogenic HPV subtypes were found in 12 of 49 (24%) women in HAART and in 25 of 45 (60%) women without HAART (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Among HIV-HPV coinfected women, highly oncogenic HPV subtypes were strongly prevalent (82%). Cervical cytological abnormalities were associated both with cervical HPV DNA and with severe immunodeficiency. High plasma HIV-1 viral load was not associated with cervical expression of highly oncogenic HPV strains. Finally, our data demonstrated a protective role of HAART to prevent cervico-vaginal cytological abnormalities, including cervical cancer, related to HPV highly oncogenic strains Results: A total 31 persons have been studied (7 females and 21 males), the median age was 45 years (range 27-64). All the women and 25% of men were heterosexual. The average number of lifetime partners was over 50. A previous STI was reported by 45% of subjects. In 25 out of 33 cases a good cytological sample was obtained: 19/25 (76%) were normal; 8% (2/25), had an inflammatory picture; 8% (2/25) were compatible with AIN III; 8% (2/25) were compatible with ASCUS. In 25/25 cases HPV genome was detected. In two cases the LIPA typing was unable to identify a particular HPV genotype; in 6/25 (24%) a low risk strain was found, in 2/25 (8%) a high risk strain was detected and 56% (14/25) had a mixed infection with strains of high and low risk. HPV16 was the prevalent strain, followed by HPV18 (32%). The most clinical significant aspect was the finding of carcinoma of the anus (two multifocal) in three cases out of 31 (10%). These were all symptomatic patients with HPV infection, but only one with a positive cytology (AIN III-HPV16 and 18). Conclusion: Regular anoscopy is an essential step for the management of HIV-positive people and this practice cannot be replaced by cytological examination only. Molecular tests confirm the high prevalence of HPV infection in HIV-infected patients with a history of anal sexual exposure. Background: We attempted to verify the existence of a connection between internalized homophobia and the acceptance of one's own HIV status in HIV infected men who have sex with men (MSM).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1114, "end": 1128, "text": "(26/276, 9.4%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1230, "text": "(13/36, 36", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2480, "end": 2512, "text": "(1985-1996) and post-(1997-2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3663, "end": 3668, "text": "(SIR,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3669, "end": 3674, "text": "82.8;", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Methods: Arcigay Bologna's Cassero Salute, with contributions from Arcigay Nazionale and Nadir Onlus, produced a 3-day residential experiential training group, set in a protected environment and aimed at a group of 26 participants aged between 24 and 57, homosexual-bisexual, HIV positive biologically male.

Introduction: The Web nowadays represents an important tool for communication; Social Networks and chat-rooms are often a virtual meeting point to seek occasional sexual partners. They have been investigated to assess if sexual intercourses starting online are more risky than traditional encounters. Existing literature shows contrasting data for either heterosexual and men who have sex with men (MSM) sex seekers; these works have been conducted in Anglo-Saxon countries while Southern Europe has never been investigated. Aim of our study is to analyze users from a popular gay chat-room in an area with a high HIV prevalence such as Milan to evaluate their risk perception and sexual behavior. Methods: Gayromeo.com is one of the most popular gay chat-room where users can create a personal profile to describe themselves, demographic and social features, social and sexual needs and habits. New users from Milan who created a profile from December, 23 to December, 30 2010 were included in the study. Users looking for sexual partners were further analyzed to evaluate condom use and factor associated with risky behaviors. Statistic analyses were performed with descriptive and logistic regression approaches. Results: During the study period an average of 59,953 users were available on the website; 682 were new users from Milan who recently created a personal profile. Their socio-demographic features are summarized in Table 1 . Of note, 33.3% were online looking for friendship and/or committed relationships; the remaining 66.7% (N = 455) were sex seekers. The majority (65.5%) claimed to perform only safe sex, while the remaining did not (bareback 0.7%; ''needs discussion'' 8.3%; ''not declared'' 25.5%). Risk factors associated with unsafe sex are shown in Table 2 . Discussion: Users of this popular gay chat-room often enter it not for sexual encounters but just for other kind of relationships. HIV-positive users are a minority, but there is probably an underreporting problem; those who declare to be positive are often online not for sex but for friends. Among sex seekers, the majority state to perform only safe sex, while the others choose to be reticent to gain greater bargaining power and appeal: being reserved about his own status seems a risk factor to engage in unsafe sexual intercourse. Condom use has still cultural implications among MSM and uncertainty about its use gives more power during the online bargain. The communicative power of these reserves is so strong that users at higher risk do not even declare to look for anal sex, since it is probably implied in their sexual messages. On the other hand, younger users (=20 years of age) and anal receptive sexual partners are at higher risk to engage in unsafe practices. These data underline the need to strengthen educative efforts for MSM for a more conscious condom use. Background: The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is on the rise worldwide. Among new cases of STIs, treponemal infections are prevalently diagnosed in men who have sex with men (MSM). STIs play a known role in the spread of HIV; however, the scarce cooperation between public health care agencies and community-based associations in Italy has meant that most prevention projects are top-down interventions. Moreover, the lack of a longterm national HIV prevention campaign and a sort of false optimism about HIV disease, engendered by readily available pharmacological S32 ICAR 2011: Abstracts treatment, have lowered risk perception and subsequently raised barriers to adopting preventive behaviours by susceptible and infected persons alike.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1960, "end": 1967, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2311, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Objectives: To implement a syphilis/HIV control program targeting MSM according to best health promotion guidelines through a collaborative project carried out by the Italian national health service (NHS) and LGBT associations.

During the Social and clinical study aimed at facilitating prevention, diagnosis and follow-up of HIV/AIDS infections and coinfections in socially and economically disadvantaged groups carried out by NI-HMP and CAA in 2009-2010, the persisting difficulties of vulnerable populations in accessing HIV screening centres became evident, as well as the need to experiment a different approach. In Milan, despite a network of private NGOs actively promoting HIV testing in their dedicated services and two public screening units (CRH ASL Milano and Infectious Diseases Division H. L.Sacco) ensuring facilitated access for vulnerable people (migrants, IDU, SW, homeless), the resulting impact was poor and led to the decision to assess feasibility of proposing rapid HIV/HCV tests to vulnerable populations in lowthreshold services (clinic Opera San Francesco, OSF, for migrants and Drop-In Centre for drug/alcohol users) and to verify the response of vulnerable populations to this approach. Methodology and planned activities: Definition of protocols with clinic OSF and Drop-In Centre, for the promotion and offer of rapid HIV1-2 and HCV antibody tests to their clients; definition of protocols with H. San Raffaele and H. L.Sacco for confirmation tests on blood in case of preliminary positive results. Definition of procedures for pre-test counselling, informed consent form and collection of patient's agreement, testing of patients on oral fluid, communication of results, post-test counselling. Specific training of counsellors and medical staff in pre-post test counselling and correct use of OraQuick Advance Tests. Preparation of forms for data collection. Results: In November-December 2010 5 days were devoted to experiment the new approach (3 at OSF, 2 at DropIn). In 3 set dates 442 patients accessed OSF clinic. They were all asked to undertake HIV/HCV counselling: 166 accepted (37.6%). In 17/166 cases decision was taken not to proceed due to language problems and one person decided not to test. Of 74 clients accessing the Drop-In in 2 days, 33 (44.6%) accepted to receive pre-test counselling and all of them were tested. Overall 181 people were tested for HIV and 169 also for HCV. 116/181 were males; only 7/181 were Italian. In 180 cases the HIV test was negative; one person had an unclear result and was addressed to hospital for confirmation; she resulted negative. 133/181 people had never tested for HIV before. 69.7% referred risk, 91.2% of them to unprotected sex. Two HCV tests resulted positive; both patients knew they had hepatitis but could not remember which type. During counselling patients declared to prefer the less invasive procedure of testing the oral fluid and the short waiting time prior to result communication (20 0 ). The staff of OFS and Drop-In expressed satisfaction for outcomes of initiative. Conclusions: Study on new approach demonstrated the possibility of testing vulnerable populations in low threshold services and the positive response of such groups to it. Introduction: In the era of test and treat HIV, we believe that universal testing are fundamental to improve early diagnosis and to avoid unaware HIV transmission and AIDS presenter patients. However many factors obstacle universal testing showing socio-economical reasons. In our setting we have a low testing activity (about 500 tests per year) with a high rate of HIV diagnosis per year (80% of AIDS presenters). At our center HIV test is offered as anonymous and free blood test with pre and post counseling.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Methods: An open door event test day was set up for the World AIDS day (1 December) with 12 h opening access from 7.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.). The event was organized with the medical and nurse staff of our center and the cooperation of the local ONG LILA and Sapienza University students of Medicine Faculty of Latina. Precounseling was performed following HIV guidelines by medical staff. A question list was performed to collect socio-demographic characteristics and sexual behaviors. HIV-test was performed on sera samples by ELISA Combo (Abbot). Results: 165 subjects adhered to the HIV-test day with a higher prevalence of female sex (60%). The median age was 25 years with a broad spectrum between 22 and 68. 65% of subjects did HIV test for the first time in their life. Most subjects revealed sexual relation with potential risk for HIV infection. The majority (94%) of persons declared heterosexual relations, only 1% was MSM. Only 31% used condom in their sexual intercourse-HIV test was negative for all subjects. Comparing this data with the usual population tested in our center we noticed that during ''open day event'' we target a population of never testers with an higher proportion of women showing sexual relation without barrier methods. Conclusions: Emerging data showed the importance of integrated action to fight HIV that involve both primary and secondary prevention with ART treatment. Expanded voluntary HIV testing seems to be important not only in HIV high burden country, but also in our settings to target subjects only apparently at low risk for HIV infection empowering them to take control of their health by seeking medical care and adopting behaviors to prevent HIV transmission. Acute and chronic HIV-1 infection can be considered as two clinical entities sharing the same etiology, but deserving distinctive diagnostic approaches. During the acute phase, indeed, the clinical picture is entirely and directly amenable to HIV-1 activity, but signs and symptoms are utterly unspecific and diagnosis is difficult without a high index of suspicion [1] . Beginning the chronic phase instead, HIV-specific symptomatology essentially eclipses, and the disease is usually diagnosed by the presence of other affections directly related to the underlying immunosuppression like tumors and other infections. Owing to the natural history of HIV-1 disease, case definitions over time principally focused on expanding the list of AIDS-defining events in the chronic phase, rather than setting specific approaches towards clinical HIV-1 diagnosis during the acute phase. In particular, a specific case definition of acute HIV-1 infection to the purpose of surveillance and control has never been released, not even in the most recent guidelines [2]. In US it has been estimated that every 9 min a new HIV-1 infection occurs [3]; since acute infection frequently results in symptomatic disease [4], a significant proportion of these patients is likely to seek medical advice, without obtaining in many cases adequate counseling for HIV-1: in fact, in US up to 45% of patients receive an AIDS diagnosis within 3 years after receiving their initial HIV-1 infection diagnosis, that is years after acute infection has been established [5] . It is universally accepted that lack of identification of acute HIV-1 infection has extremely severe consequences involving both individuals and community: antiretroviral therapy is not offered at the optimal time for the patient, and HIV-1 transmission is not impeded during the phase of maximal infectivity, due to the patient's unawareness of infection and transmissibility, the likely persistence of risk behaviour, and the very high HIV-1 concentration in plasma and semen. We suggest that by means of active surveillance of acute HIV-1 infection we might be able to reduce HIV-1 transmission. The efficacy of this approach has been shown in other severe acute viral infections epidemics (e.g. SARS). We propose the development of a ''bedside'' acute case definition based on a combination of clinical and epidemiological criteria like those presented in Table 1 , to the purpose to enhance visibility of HIV-1 acute presentation in the community medicine; such definition is meant to stratify patients at the bedside (suspect/probable acute cases of HIV-1 infection), to be then lab-referred for confirmation. This definition should ideally be combined to an educational campaign to the wide lay public and health care practitioners alike (particularly at the primary care level), to actively search for cases and improve sensitivity. Finally, it should be validated on the field. Background: Current guidelines recommend three drug combinations to treat antiretroviral na\u00efve HIV-infected patients; some data of novel strategies with NRTI-sparing regimen in this setting are now available. The study compares immunovirological efficacy and safety of once daily maraviroc (MVC) 150 mg plus lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) plus LPV/r. Methods: This is an ongoing, proof-of-concept, randomized, openlabel, 48 weeks trial. Data were collected at baseline (BL) and at 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. Comparisons between groups evaluated by the Chi-square or Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Results reported as median (Q1-Q3) or frequency (%), as appropriate. Results: Up to date, 41 pts (20 MVC, 21 TDF/FTC) were enrolled: age 40 years, 1/41 female, infected since 3.8 years. At BL:median CD4 285 cells/lL; CD4% 18.5, HIV-RNA 4.4 (3.9-4.9) log 10 . No difference in BL characteristics were found between the two treatment groups. At W24, all patients in both groups had HIV-RNA \\50 copies/ml; CD4 cells count increased in both groups. HIVRNA decrease and CD4 cells count increase was more rapid in MVC group. Immunological and virological results are showed in Table 1 . Treatment was well tolerated, without significant increase in AST, ALT, CPK, cholesterol, triglycerides and glycaemia; 3/41 (7%) pts discontinued the study due to diarrhea LPV/r. Despite the success of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HA-ART) in reducing peripheral viral load as well as improving CD4+ counts, neurological disorders, involving both the central and peripheral nervous system, still affect approximately 50% of HIVinfected patients. Neuroinflammation, a process mainly initiated and sustained by infected-activated microglial cells, plays a prominent role in the physiopathology of HIV-1 related neurological disorders. Microglial cells, the macrophages resident in the central nervous system, also represent a virus reservoir. Infected microglial cells become activated and release a vast array of pro-inflammatory mediators as well as HIV-1 proteins, that sustain cell activation and mediate neuronal damage. Among the latter, the glycoprotein gp120 is believed to play a crucial role. Gp120 is the envelope protein that allows the virus entry in the host cells via binding to the CD4 receptor together with a specific co-receptor (CCR5/CXCR4). Different strains of HIV-1 viruses have been characterized for their differential ability to infect host cells. Briefly, the beta-chemokine receptor, CCR5, is the major co-receptor for the macrophage (M)-tropic (R5) strains of HIV-1, whereas the alpha-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, facilitates entry of T-tropic (X4) HIV-1 strains. Small molecular weight inhibitors of the CCR5 co-receptor represent a new class of antiretroviral drugs, among which Maraviroc is in clinical use. By preventing CCR5 binding, these drugs abort HIV-1-cell membrane fusion and interrupt the HIV-1 replication cycle. By interfering with a chemokine receptor that is highly expressed on microglial cells, these drugs have therefore the potential to reduce microglial pro-inflammatory activation during HIV-1 infection. To test this hypothesis, we used primary cultures of rat cortical microglial cells activated by different isoforms of gp120 derived from M and T-tropic viruses. Gp120CN54, a M-tropic derived gp120, showed the highest pro-inflammatory effects in this paradigm, thus it was used to test the antiinflammatory potential of maraviroc. The latter displays opposite effects, depending on whether or not interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) was also present in the system; indeed, cytokines like IFNgamma, mainly produced by active CD4+Th1 T cells, contribute to exacerbate microglial proinflammatory activation during HIV disease clinical course. While maraviroc consistently reduces pro-inflammatory effects of Gp120CN54, it increases the pro-inflammatory activation elicited by the co-administration of Gp120CN54 and IFNgamma. Taken together, these data suggest a potential beneficial use of maraviroc in the early phase of HIV infection, when cytokine production (including IFNgamma) in the brain is lower, thus providing additional benefits in preventing neuropathology associated with HIV infection. Background: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders have been showed to be highly prevalent even in HAART treated patients. Since several factors related to subjects, viruses and drugs characteristics have been associated to these phenomena, monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters should be considered in neurologically impaired patients. Methods: Samples from HIV-positive patients undergoing lumbar punctures for clinical reasons were analyzed for plasma and CSF viral loads (with a limit of detection of 20 copies/ml), genotype resistance testing and predicted tropism, BBB integrity indexes (Albumin, IgG and Tourtelotte) and for plasma and CSF concentrations of antiretrovirals (measured through a validated HPLC-MS method). CNS Penetration-Effectiveness Score (CPE) was calculated according to the 2010 version. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range); Spearman's analysis were used to test association between variables. Results: Fifty patients on different HAART regimens undergoing lumbar punctures for diagnostic reasons were included in this analysis. Median age and CD4 were 44 years (37-51) and 216 (66-524) cells/ll; 60% of them were male. Samples were collected 2-24 h after drug intake. CSF and plasma viral load (VL) were respectively 2.14 (1.27-3.32) and 1.8 (1.27-3.19 ) Log copies/ml; the VL CSF-to-plasma ratio ranged from 0.28 to 7.20. Among virologically suppressed patients (24/50), 20.8% showed a detectable CSF VL (ranging from 74 to 950 copies/ml). CPE score in this cohort was 7 (6-8) while 80% of patients with CSF escape had a CPE score = 7. Blood-brain barrier (available in 35 pts) was impaired in 12 (34.3%) with albumin and IgG ratios respectively of 0.52 (0.37-0.84) and 0.54 (0.36-0.77); inflammatory patterns were seen in 57.1% of them. CSFto-plasma ratios of antiretrovirals were substantially comparable to the ones previously reported except for higher raltegravir ratios [0.21 (0.10-0.29)]. Cerebrospinal drug levels were below IC 50 more frequently in PI intakers (atazanavir 7/10, lopinavir 7/11 and darunavir 4/9) as compared to newer drugs treated ones (raltegravir 1/17, maraviroc 0/4, etravirine 0/1). Conclusion: Our results in a very heterogeneous cohort of HAARTtreated patients show a great variability in CSF parameters. The cerebrospinal evaluation of virologically suppressed patients revealed that 20.8% of them had a detectable viral load and a slightly lower median CPE (6 vs. 7) as compared to concordant virus controllers. A relevant proportion of boosted PIs-treated patients (60%) showed CSF PI concentration below the IC 50 ; conversely a higher than previously reported passage of raltegravir was noted (21 vs. 3-5%). This high variability should be related to individual characteristics, co-administered drugs and blood-brain barrier impairment (that was present in a significant proportion of subjects). The clinical impact of these observations should be evaluated in long term follow-up prospective studies. Introduction: Atazanavir (ATV) is frequently prescribed boosted or unboosted in association with a tenofovir (TDF) or abacavir (ABC) containing backbone. We investigated efficacy, safety, discontinuation rates and pharmacokinetics of these regimens in routine clinical practice. Methods: We retrospectively selected patients treated with ATV plus an NRTI backbone. Four regimens were compared: (1) ATV/r+TDFbased backbone;", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2079, "end": 2082, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3250, "end": 3253, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10203, "end": 10217, "text": "1.8 (1.27-3.19", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4116, "end": 4123, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 5843, "end": 5850, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "(2) ATV/r+ABC-based backbone;", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "(3) ATV+TDFbased backbone; (4) ATV+ABC-based backbone.

At baseline no significant between groups differences were observed regarding HIV-RNA and CD4. Median observation time was 15.4 months (IQR 4.9-31.5). Overall, 55.2% of patients discontinued ATV during follow up, of which 29.8% in the first year of therapy. Virologic failure and toxicity were responsible for treatment discontinuation in 2.1 and 16.4% of patients, respectively. At the end of follow up HIV-RNA and CD4 cells count did not significantly differ between groups. Survival curves showed a significant between groups difference in the probability of regimen discontinuation (p = 0.002), with higher risk for group 2 (46% at 24 months) and lower for group 4 (14% at 24 months).

Since the early 1980s Neuroimaging has achieved high specificity in the diagnosis of cerebral HIV/AIDS-related lesions, thanks to improvement of morphologic techniques, functional MR sequences and metabolic studies provided by nuclear medicine. This allows the clinician a more accurate diagnosis, thus reducing the necessity for cerebral biopsy. On the other hand, the specificity of some HIV/ AIDS-related imaging findings can allow the neuroradiologist to correctly address the patient to the infectivologist. Antiretroviral drugs (HAART) have improved the chances of survival and the quality of life of AIDS patients and have dramatically reduced the incidence of complications. The immunoreconstruction induced by new drugs has modified some histopathologic features and, as a consequence, the neuroradiologic aspects of classic features. Moreover, a new syndrome, called IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) due to restoration of immunity to specific infection and non-infection antigens has been described in a small percentage of patients with AIDS. This condition is of profound clinical significance and must be diagnosed promptly. Neuroimaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and follow up of these patients, by monitoring treatment response, identifying disease progression and predicting prognosis, in this new syndrome as well as in the other classic complications occurring in HIV/AIDS setting. Many factors are known to contribute to faster progression of cardiovascular (CV) aging and disease in HIV infected patients. In addition to traditional CV risk factors, we investigated for the first time in a single-site Italian HIV cohort several psychological factors including Alexithymia, TypeD personality, mental and physical components (MCS and PCS) of quality of life (QoL) and depression, in parallel with intima-media thickness of carotid arteries. HIV infected patients were consecutively enrolled from February to December, 2010. Single operators assessed both carotid intima-media Thickness and the presence of plaque(s) by B-mode ultrasonography, as well as the psychological factors, including Alexithymia, using the 20-item Toronto-Alexithymia-Scale (TAS-20, cut-off = 50), TypeD personality, using the DS14 Distress Scale (Negative Affectivity Scale, cut-off = 9; Social Inhibition Scale, cut-off = 9), depression symptoms, using the Beck depression inventory (BDI, cut-off = 15) and QoL, using the SF12 questionnaire. All statistical analyses were carried out using the Stata 10.0 package. , male sex (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.14-9.50, p = .03), hypertension (OR 3.14, CI 1.11-8.9, p = .03) duration of HIV infection (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.14, p = .04), confirmed their independent association. On a monocentric Caucasian population, Alexithymia was tightly associated with the presence of CPs, more remarkably than most traditional CV risk factors. Its diagnosis appears to usher a new tool for a better management of CV risk and disease in HIV patients. Several studies in patients on successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) but with a history of drug-resistance, provided evidence for the dynamic nature of the latent reservoir and showed that any viral variant, including drug-resistant variants, will enter the reservoir and remain conserved. Some studies have showed that, when the viral load is below the detection limit, antiretroviral resistance does not occur, whereas other show that resistant related mutations can indeed emerge under such conditions. In order to gain new insights into the dynamic of archived resistant viral variants occurring during suppressive ART, we evaluated the evolution of drug resistance mutations in proviral DNA in 20 patients treated with therapeutic regimen which included Darunavir (DRV) + Raltegravir or DRV combined with NRTI or with NNRTI. All subjects had already been treated with several antiretroviral drugs, with a mean number of 6.4 \u00b1 2.0 NNRTI and 4.8 \u00b1 2.2 PI, and had been receiving antiretroviral treatment for a long time (mean period 17 years; range 12-24 years). Eleven patients were also experienced for NNRTI. During follow-up all subjects had plasma viremia \\50 copies/ml. In only two patients an intermittent low viremia was observed during follow up. Proviral DNA was extracted and amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sequenced by the TruGene assay (Siemens Heathcare Diagnostics). The analysis was performed at baseline, and after 6 and 18 months of therapy. At baseline all patients showed drug resistance mutations in the proviral DNA. All mutations were related to ART previously received. Specifically, considering the whole population, at time 0 the number of mutations detected in proviral DNA was 12.2 \u00b1 5.17 and after 18 months of therapy the total number of mutations was 12.6 \u00b1 5.0. Interestingly in 10 of 20 (50%) the number of mutations increased and decreased in 7 of 20 (35%). Specifically, in 11 patients the change in resistance mutations number was observed both in RT and PRO region; in 4 patients only RT mutations number changed as well as in 2 individuals only PRO mutations number differed from the number detected at baseline. In only 3 individuals the number of mutations at 18 months was the same to the number detected at baseline, but the type of mutations were different. Although performed on a small patient population, these data suggest that the mutational archive in HIV-DNA from PBMC can change during suppressive ART. The long therapeutic history of these patients and the high number of resistant viral variants archived in PBMC does not allow to claim that the appearance of new mutations, observed in some patients, was due to the selection of new viral variants. However the appearance and disappearance of drug resistance mutations, suggest that: HIV replication continue at low levels despite therapy, and/or long-lived cells containing HIV proviruses produce HIV at low levels after reactivation. Aims: To establish HIV-1 RNA and proviral DNA dynamics in primary infection and to assess quasispecies composition (V3 diversity and proportion of X4 variants) in circulating and GALT-associated HIV. Methods: Twenty acutely infected patients were enrolled within 4 weeks from seroconversion (T0). Ten patients remained free of therapy, 10 started HAART based on clinical presentation. Viral quasispecies in plasma RNA and in PBMC proviral DNA was assessed at T0 and at 6 months (T6) by V3 ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Viral quasispecies was also assessed at T0 in GALT proviral DNA. Prediction of co-receptor usage was performed by PSSM.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Results: At T0, the amount of HIV-1 RNA and proviral DNA in PBMC were positively correlated (r = 0.457, p = 0.043); no correlation between CD4 and HIV-1 RNA was observed. Half of patients displayed X4 variants above 0.3% in viral RNA quasispecies, with intra-patient median proportion of X4 variants of 0.31% (range 0.30-56.25%); 7/12 patients displayed X4 variants [0.3% in PBMC proviral DNA, median proportion 0.99% (range 0.30-3.55%); 2/5 patients displayed X4 variants [0.3% in GALT proviral DNA, median proportion 0.30% (range 0.30-0.87%). Compartmentalization of viral quasispecies could be observed in patients with high diversity. In patients who underwent early treatment, baseline CD4 cells were lower as compared to those who remained untreated (p = 0.028). Consistently, the T0 V3 diversity was significantly higher in both circulating viral and proviral sequences (627.5 vs. 71.5 mean substitutions/site 9 10 -4 , p = 0.019 and 423 vs. 29 mean substitutions/ site 9 10 -4 , p = 0.018, respectively). At T6, in patients undergoing HAART the mean decline of HIV-1 RNA and DNA was 3.69 Log copies/ml and 0.6 Log copies/106 PBMC, respectively, while in the untreated patients the RNA viral load virtually remained unchanged (0.07 Log copies/ml, p \\ 0.001 vs. the treated group), while proviral DNA showed a modest increase (0.31 Log copies/106 PBMC, p = 0.040 vs. the treated group). Consistently, in patients who remained free of therapy, the diversity of PBMC proviral DNA, but not that of viral RNA sequences, significantly increased from T0 to T6. Although overall (T0 + T6) diversity and proportion of X4 variants were positively correlated (r = 0.382, p = 0.004), the numbers were insufficient, at present, to compare the trend of X4 frequency in the two groups during the observation period.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Discussion: Our findings show that X4 variants may be commonly present, with very broad range of intra-patient frequency, during the early phases of HIV infection.

Background: The range 10-100 of false-positive rate (FPR) is a so far qualitative percentage score provided by Geno2Pheno-algorithm that positively predicts the use of the CCR5-coreceptor. We evaluated the potential correlation between FPR obtained by population V3genotyping and the presence of HIV-1 variants with DM/X4-tropism, detected by both enhanced-sensitivity trofile assay (ESTA) and ultradeep V3-pyrosequencing (UDPS Coreceptor tropism (CTR) is increasingly deduced from the genotype on the basis of V3 alone. However, mutations outside V3 can conceivably influence CTR, possibly explaining discordant results between genotypic and phenotypic assays. This study analyzes the impact of mutations outside V3 on CTR as determined by the enhanced sensitivity trofile assay (ESTA). Paired ESTA (Monogram BioSciences) and gp120 sequences (population sequencing; codon 32 of C1 to V5) were obtained from 47 newly diagnosed subtype B HIV-1-infected patients; all were na\u00efve to antiretroviral therapy and included 30% with AIDS. For gp120 sequence analysis, nucleotide mixtures were considered when the second highest electropherogram peak was [25%; sequences were translated into all possible permutations giving a total of 342 sequences. Relationship between ESTA and patient-and sequence-related variables was assessed by logistic regression (clustering for patient was considered). Sequence positions were tested with simple correspondence analysis and those with the highest inertia (variance; namely, upper decile) were retained in multiple correspondence analysis (MCA Background: HIV-1 dual-tropic species predominate in a significant proportion of patients, and have peculiar properties in term of response to entry inhibitors.

Figure 1 shows the association between LD phenotypes and EAT. Factors associated with EAT were: age (b = 0.6, CI 0.2;1.0), male gender (b = 6.6, CI 0.5;12.7), VAT (b = 0.12, CI 0.08;0.17), waist girth (b = 0.7, CI 0.04;1.3), liver fat (b = -19.6, CI -32.6;-6.8), current CD4 (b = 0.6, CI 0.1;1.2), total cholesterol (b = 0.1, CI 0.02;0.15), cumulative exposure to ART (b = 0.05, CI 0.00;0.11). EAT volume was independently associated with CAC [100 (OR 1.10, CI 1.02;1.20). In the prospective substudy, factors associated with EAT change were CD4 reconstitution (defined as current-nadir delta CD4 cell count) (b = 0.5, CI 0.1;0.8), and time between CT scans (b = 4.5, CI 0.4;8.7). EAT change had the closest association with CAC score [100 (p = .047) (Fig. 2) . Conclusions: This study shows an association between EAT and central fat accumulation and mixed form LD phenotypes. HIV specific and traditional factors, including male gender, were associated with EAT. CD4 increase from nadir was associated with EAT progression suggesting a possible influence of adiposity-related inflammation on atherosclerosis. Methods: Eight weeks old C57/Bl6 wild type (WT) and ''humanized'' hPXR transgenic mice were randomized into three groups (N = 6-8/group): group 1, no treatment; group 2, intraperitoneally administration of ritonavir (5 mg/kg/day) alone and, group 3, in combination with leflunomide (40 mg/kg/day by gavage). All drugs were administered for 12 days. At the end of the experiment animals fasted 12 h, received the latest administration and 4 h later were sacrificed. Results: We found that 12 days of ritonavir administration in wild type (WT) and hPXR mice increases plasma triacylglycerols, cholesterol and LDL. This effect was abrogated by co-treating WT mice with leflunomide (P \\ 0.05). In hPXR mice leflunomide revertes the hypertriglyceridemia induced by ritonavir (P \\ 0.05), but has no effect on plasmatic cholesterol levels. Moreover this experiment demonstrates that treating WT mice with this PI has no effect on liver weight and liver/body weight ratio (P [ 0.05), whereas increases significantly liver triacylglycerols (P \\ 0.05); this effect is reverted by leflunomide co-treatment (P \\ 0.05). In WT mice ritonavir causes liver steatosis, induction of the liver expression of genes involved in PXR mediated triacylglycerols synthesis, and increases the triacylglycerol storage, such as the fatty acid elongation (FAE) and Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1(SCD-1) (P \\ 0.05). Leflunomide reduces the ritonavir induction of FAE (P \\ 0.05), but in contrast increases SCD-1 mRNA levels (P \\ 0.05) and in addition induces a prosteatogenic gene such as CD36 (P \\ 0.05). In WT mice CYP3A11, a canonical PXR target gene, is induced by all treatments. In hPXR mice ritonavir induces alone SCD-1 gene and reduces CD36 expression (P \\ 0.05).

Purpose: Ischemic cardiovascular events represent an increasingly frequent complication of long-lasting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and have been attributed either to the infection itself or to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Endothelial dysfunction is a precocious marker of atherosclerosis. Abacavir use has been associated with an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events in several cohort studies, but the pathogenic mechanisms are still unknown. Our aim was to assess whether patients with chronic HIV-infection present endothelial dysfunction and if this is the consequence of infection or of HAART, comparing patients treated with abacavir (ABC) or tenofovir (TDF). Methods: In a retrospective, case-control study, the time course of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was examined in 62 HIV-infected patients, before starting HAART and after 6-12 months of therapy with either ABC (n = 31) or TDF (n = 31). Data were compared with those from 20 untreated HIV-infected patients at diagnosis and after 6 months and 10 healthy matched controls. Soluble endothelial activation markers were measured in plasma by flow cytometry using a bead-based assay. Of the above patients, 21 (11 ABC and 10 TDF) were recalled after a further 28-34 months for the measurement of flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs). FMD was measured using the Endo-PAT2000 system, a simple, noninvasive, diagnostic test for endothelial function; CECs were identified by CD45+, CD31+, CD146+ and quantified by flow cytometry.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Results: sVCAM-1 and MCP-1 were significantly higher in HIVinfected patients at diagnosis than in healthy controls. During follow-up, sVCAM-1 and MCP-1 tended to decrease, without significant differences between ABC and TDF.

Overall, FMD was reduced by 21% (p \\ 0.05) in HIV-infected patients as compared with healthy controls, with no difference between ABC (1.32 \u00b1 0.13) and TDF (1.28 \u00b1 0.23, p = ns). ABCtreated patients had significantly higher ECs when compared to controls (16.8 \u00b1 8.1/?l vs. 0.34 \u00b1 0.08/?l, p \\ 0.05) and tendentially higher as compared with TFD-treated patients (16.8 \u00b1 8.1/?l vs. 9.3 \u00b1 3.8/?l, p = ns).

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend in bone turnover markers, vitamin D3, and parathormone (PTH) after two standard antiretroviral regimens. Methods: This study is a sub-study of the INCA trial, a randomized, multicentre study conducted in antiretroviral na\u00efve patients who were randomized to TDF + FTC + ATV/r or EFV. Patients were assessed at baseline (i.e., before antiretroviral treatment), after 6 months, and after 1 year follow-up. The following markers were analyzed: vitamin D, parathormone (PTH), bone resorption markers (i.e., osteoprotegerin, OPG; carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks, CTX; receptor activator of nuclear factor K-B ligand, RANK-L) and a bone formation marker (osteocalcin). Repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, with data input performed according with last observation carried forward method. The overall time-variation of the markers in the two arms was evaluated by mixedfactorial random-coefficient general-linear-model. Results: In this substudy, 75 patients were included: 42 in the ATV/r arm and 33 in the EFV arm; 61 (81.3%) were males; mean age was 41.2 (SD 11.9) years; mean CD4+ was 274 (SD 128) cells/mm 3 . No significant differences were found between the two arms at baseline. The overall trends were increasing for PTH values (p = 0.0002), osteocalcin (p \\ 0.0001), OPG (p = 0.0432), and CTX (p \\ 0.0001). No significant decreases of vitamin D3 levels were found. Moreover, no significant differences for any markers between the two arms were found throughout the follow-up, except for CTX that decreased more in the EFV arm than in the ATV/r arm (p = 0.0146). RANK-L was undetectable (\\0.0063 pg/ml) in most patients throughout the study. Conclusion: These data confirm that antiretroviral therapy has a impact (either direct or mediated by its viro-immunological activity) on bone turn-over. Although this effect was more evident after 6 months, it persisted up to 1 year without any major differences between the two arms. Thus, TDF + ATV/r did not appear to alter the bone metabolism more than TDF + EFV co-administration. Aim: To identify differences in liver steatosis between HIV/HCV coinfection and HCV monoinfection. Methods: Liver biopsies from 190 consecutive HIV/HCV coinfected (Group HIV/HCV) and 190 age and sex pair-matched HCV monoinfected patients (Group HVC) were analyzed for steatosis (score 1 = 1-10% of hepatocytes with fatty deposition, score 2 = 11-30%; score 3 = 31-60%; score 4 = [60%). Included in the study were patients na\u00efve for HCV treatment, aging 18 or more, HBsAg negative and with an alcohol intake lower than 40 g daily for males and 30 g daily for females. To evaluate the influence of the age on the degree of liver steatosis patients were distributed in four age classes: 18-30 years, 31-40, 41-50, more than 50. Results: HIV/HCV coinfected patients showed a good immunological condition (CD4 = 542 + 192.51) and compared with those HCV monoinfected more frequently showed HCV-genotype 3 (53.7 vs. 5.5%, p \\ 0.001); most patients with HCV genotype three were drug addicts. Severe steatosis (score 3 or 4) was more frequent in Group HIV/HCV than in Group HCV (47 vs, 21.1%, p \\ 0.005) with statistical significance also in single age classes 18-31 (p = 0.001), 31-40 (p = 0.007) and 41-50 (p = 0.00003). The frequency of patients with severe steatosis did not increase with the increase of the age, neither in Group HIV/HCV nor in Group HCV. In Group HIV/ HCV severe steatosis was more frequent in patients with HCV genotype 3 than in those with other genotypes (56.4 vs. 3.1%, p = 0.02); analyzed in relation with the HAART regimen administered at the time of liver biopsy no difference in the frequency of severe steatosis was observed between patients receiving a PI HA-ART based, PI + D4T HAART, NNRTI, HAART including only D4T or left untreated. Other finding in both Group HIV/HCV and HCV was the absence of correlation between the degree of liver steatosis and that of fibrosis and necroinflammation, nor between liver steatosis and aminotransferasis, CD4+ cell count, nadir of CD4+, HIV and HCV viral load. Conclusion: Severe liver steatosis is a frequent event in HIV/HCV coinfected patients dining alcool abuse, related to the presence of HCV genotype 3 in drug addicts, but no correlation was observed with HAART administration. Cutaneous manifestations are frequently observed in patients with HIV infection. In pre-ART era most of them are related to opportunistic infection involving skin, but now with the continuing introduction of new antiviral drugs, they are primary caused by immune allergy. The correct diagnosis is often difficult and require histology. Here we present two cases of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) with skin fragility and bullous lesions in photo-exposed area in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. Case 1: a 46 years old woman with a long history of HIV infection (diagnosis in 1985, CDC:B3) and HCV chronic hepatitis. She was on ARV therapy since 1992 and she experienced several drugs including NRTI, NNRTI and boosted PI with virological suppression. She often self-stopped therapy due to skin manifestations. Regarding HCV hepatitis she was treated twice with IFN + RBV with virological relapse. In 2010 she stopped ARV and restarted it after 2 months with a new combination (CCR5 tropic virus was revealed): abacavir, 3TC and maraviroc. After 1 months she presented skin fragility and bullous skin lesions on her hand, interpreted us prurigo. She did not stop therapy this time because of very good immune virologic results (HIV-RNA undetectable, CD4+ 540). After 5 months skin lesions get worse and diffused to the face. An expert advice suggested 24 h/ urinary and plasma porphyrin dosage that let us to diagnosis of Porphyria cutanea tarda. She started erythro-apheresis with a progressive decrease of urine and plasma porphyrins (from 5.13 mg/24 h to 1.98 and from 0.104 mg/L to 0.059 respectively).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Case 2: a 51 years old man with a long history of HIV infection (diagnosis in 1986, CDC: C3) and HCV chronic hepatitis.

In 2005 he started fosamprenavir, atazanavir, ritonavir and abacavir/ lamivudine with undetectable HIV-RNA and lymphocytes T CD4+ 380/mmc. Regarding HCV hepatitis he was treated in 2009 with IFN + RBV with virological failure. After 3 months he showed recurrent bullous skin lesions on his upper limbs. After 1 year skin lesions get worse and the patient underwent cutaneous biopsy with diagnosis of Porphyria cutanea tarda type I. He started a cycle of phlebotomies with a decrease of urine porphyrins and resolution of symptoms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "In these two cases PCT was associated to a long HIV infection with viral control associated with HCV not advanced chronic infection. Although HCV infection seems to be the most important factors in determining the disease, also antiviral therapy could be implicated. Indeed the complex metabolic way of porphyrins accumulation could be inhibited by antiviral drugs increasing the cytochrome P450 activity or SA-heme-oxidation. Both phlebotomy and erythro-apheresis seem to be effective in controlling the diseases. His right eye presented with a scleral nodule and keratitis. Other notable findings included generalized tender lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory abnormalities included: leukopenia, and anemia. A dermatologist made a clinical diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum. Skin biopsy subsequently revealed an alternative diagnosis. Serological tests revealed a RPR of 1:32, with a positive IgM, a positive FTA test, and a TPPA titer of 1:5,120. Given the serologic test results for syphilis, and after considering the skin manifestations the patient received 24 million units of iv penicillin G per day, in addition to iv tigecycline. Topical tetracycline ointment and ocular antibiotics were also administered. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurred during the first 24 h of penicillin administration. Upon completion of the two-week treatment period all the lesions were healed with residual hypopigmentation and scarring. The skin histology exam revealed the presence of lymphocytes, histocytes and plasma cells. HIC staining for Treponema pallidum revealed a large number of spirochetes. These results were obtained towards completion of the course of therapy. At follow-up visits only disseminated dyschromic patches were evidenced. Serology after 4-9 months revealed RPR of 1:8 and 1:2, respectively, both with a negative IgM test. Discussion: Clinical manifestations of secondary syphilis vary greatly, earning the epigram of ''great imitator''.

In our case the skin manifestations were erroneously considered clinically consistent with a possible nonspecific bacterial infection. The diagnosis was actually established through strongly positive serological tests, a severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, an excellent response to antibiotic therapy and, most importantly, the positive HIC study with antitreponema antibodies, which represents a rarity in the literature. We emphasize the importance of lues maligna in the differential diagnosis of HIV-infected patients with diffuse ulceronodular lesions as well as the usefulness of histological investigations completed by HIC study. Background: Analyses performed in subjects that despite multiple exposures to HIV never seroconvert or shown any sign of infection (HIV exposed seronegative individuals, HESN) revealed that this phenotype can be associated with the exclusive priming of protective T lymphocytes presumably within a favourable genetic setting. Thus, as the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases type 2 (ERAP2) trims the peptides that will be loaded on MHC class I, shaping the quality of the peptides that will be presented to CD8+ T lymphocytes we investigated its role in resistance to HIV infection. . Circulating mDCs, pDCs, HLA-DR+/CD38+/CD4+ T or CD8+ T were assessed in whole blood samples using TruCOUNT assay. All patients were tested for estrogen, progesterone and testosterone plasma levels with ELISA kits. Blood was stimulated over-night with LPS, LPS+IFN-gamma and SN were tested for IP10, IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-2 production with FlowCytomix Pro 2.4 (eBioscience).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Results: As we seen in our precedent study, women had lower levels of mDCs than men in HIV patients and in controls. We found a positive correlation between testosterone levels and mDCs count (p = 0.038 in men group and p = 0.002 in women group). Also in HIV patients mDC/testosterone correlation was present. There were no significant differences in circulating pDC and CD4 count between men and women. Pregnant women showed higher levels of activated circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes (HLADR+CD38+) compared to non pregnant women (p = 0.004). In pregnant women we found a positive correlation between progesterone levels and TNF-alpha production (p = 0.0149). In both pregnant and non pregnant groups the immune activation level, in terms of CD4+HLADR+CD38+, had a positive correlation with oestrogen levels (p = 0.01 in non pregnant group and p = 0.009 in pregnant group) and estrogen levels also had a negative correlation with the IP10 level produced in response to LPS stimulation (p = 0.0131). No significant correlations between estr, prog, testost levels and IP10, TNFalpha, IFN gamma production in all the other groups. Concerning IP10 production in response to LPS stimulation, we noticed that there were a significant difference between HIV-and HIV+ groups, HIV-people producing more IP10 (mean 4,383 pg/mL) than HIV+ people (2,066 pg/mL) with p = 0.001. As expected, in HIV+ group there was a higher IFNgamma production in response to LPS compared to HIV-group (244.16 vs. 0; p = 0.004) Conclusions: The study suggests that innate immunity could play an important role in driving the differences in immune activation and disease progression in HIV-infected women and men. Our study also suggest that sexual hormones are in part responsible of immune differences between women and men and between pregnant and non pregnant women. These results could be a starting point for a more precise gender definition of immunity and a gender-specific analysis of HIV infection, opening also to the possibility of different therapeutic strategies We considered 365 patients, of whom 9 with an acute (2.5%), 35 with a recent (9.6%) and 321 with an established infection (87.9%). All cases were reactive by the ARCHITECT 4th generation assay, with median S/CO values of 36 in acute, 108 in recent and 430 in established infections. The percentage of WB positive cases increased from 11.1% in acute to 60.0% in recent and to 95.8% in established infections (p \\ 0.001 by Chi-square for linear trend); the most frequently reactive bands in all phases of infection were those against the env region antigens; of note, the positivity for gp41 increased according to the duration of infection from 0% in acute to 51.4% in recent and to 96.9% in established infection. An AI \\0.80 was found in 42/44 acute and recent infections (95.4%) and only in 4/321 (1.2%) established infections. Considering as misclassified also the 25 results (6.8%) that fell in the grey zone (AI 0.75-0.84), the AI accuracy was 92.1%. Conclusion: The AI is the most reliable serological parameter for the discrimination of recent HIV infections. The calculation of this index is easy and it is especially useful in surveillance programs, where it will allow an estimation of the incidence of HIV infection and the relative proportion of newly infected individuals according to different risk behaviours. Background: A hallmark of non-B subtype HIV-1 spread in Italy is the very high proportion (about 60%) of F1 variant, circulating at high prevalence in South America and Eastern Europe. Aim of this study was to investigate the features of subtype F1 circulation through phylogenetic approaches. Methods: We analyzed pol sequences of 343 patients carrying F1 subtype stored in the ARCA database and obtained from 1998 to 2009. All sequences had a subtype assignment through phylogenetic analysis using Phylip package and Simplot software. The transmission networks were identified using the starting tree performed with MrBayes (GTR+I+G model). The MCMC search was run for 10 9 106 generations sampled every 100th. Only clades with a posterior probability of 1 were considered transmission clusters. Dated phylogeny for each clade were performed using Beast. Results: Regarding the citizenship, 79.7% (n = 208), 8% (n = 21) and 6.9% (n = 18) of patients were Italians, South Americans, Rumanians, respectively. The risk factor was as follows: 61.4% (n = 126) for HEs, 25.4% (n = 52) for HOs and 13.2% (n = 27) for IDUs. Males were 255 (75.2%). Place of residence was 46.6% (n = 160), 46.9% (n = 161) and 6.4% (n = 22) in Northern, Central and Southern Italy, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that 70% (240/343) of sequences clustered in 27 transmission networks. The 7 larger clusters included 56, 26, 24, 17, 12, 12 and 8 patients. All Rumanian patients were included in the largest cluster, while only 8/21 (38%) South Americans belonged to 8 distinct clusters. The heterosexual modality of infection was significantly associated with the probability to be detected in transmission networks (78.6% HEs vs. 63.5% HOs, p = .03). HEs were prevalent either among Italians (77.9%, n = 81) or Romanians (100%, n = 6); by contrast, HOs accounted for 71.4% of South American patients (p = .007). A significantly higher proportion of clustering sequences belonged to patients residing in the Northern part of Italy (52.1% for North, 40.4% for Center and 7.5% for South, p = .001).Within the epidemiological networks the Italian HEs males (74.3%, n = 65) were predominant, while males and females among HEs Rumanians were equally distributed (40% males and 60% females). Dated phylogeny, based on Time of Most Recent Common Ancestor, evaluated in conjunction with citizenship of patients, indicated that the majority of older clusters included South American HOs. Conclusions: A very high proportion of epidemiological clusters could be identified in heterosexual individuals carrying F1 subtype. Their proportions are equally distributed in the North and in the Centre of Italy, however transmission networks were prevalent at North. Foreign patients were mainly Rumanian males or females and South American HOs. Italian HE males predominated within transmission clusters. Dated analysis suggests that F1 variant from South America gave rise to the Italian F1 epidemic through multiple introduction events. Introduction: In the Italian regions where a surveillance system for new HIV diagnoses is operating, the proportion of non-nationals among new HIV diagnoses has increased, from 11.0% in 1992 to 29.7% in 2003, and leveled-off thereafter. The objective of the present study is to analyze the characteristics of non-nationals with a new HIV diagnosis and the incidence of HIV infection among nonnationals between 2003 and 2009. Methods: Data on HIV diagnoses were provided by those regions where a surveillance system is operating. In 2009, the residents in these regions accounted for 70.6% of the total resident population. We defined as ''non nationals'' those persons born outside of Italy, or with foreign nationality, or foreign citizenship. The incidence among non-nationals was estimated as the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among non-nationals (numerator) divided by the annual number of non-nationals legally residing in the same areas (denominator) per 100,000. Data on the number of legally resident nonnationals were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and are available since 2003. Results: Between 2003 and 2009, 3,828 new HIV diagnoses were reported among non-nationals, accounting for 29.7% of the 12,875 new HIV diagnoses reported by the regional surveillance systems. The distribution by geographic area showed that 52.6% of nonnationals originated from Africa, 28.2% from South America, 7.0% from Eastern Europe, 5.1% from Asia, and the remaining originated from other European countries, Central-North America, and Oceania. Males accounted for 52.0% of the total. The highest proportion of cases was reported in the age group 30-34 years (22.8%). Heterosexual contact was the most common exposure category, being reported by 51.3% males and 79.4% females. Homosexual contact was reported by 23.0% males. The number of legally resident nonnationals was 568,610 in 2003 and 3,169,843 in 2009. The incidence of HIV infection among non-nationals significantly decreased (p \\ 0.0001), from 77.6 new diagnoses per 100,000 residence permits in 2003, to 22.6 new diagnoses per 100,000 residence permits in 2009. In the same period, incidence among Italians significantly decreased (p \\ 0.0001), from 6.4 new diagnoses per 100,000 residents in 2003, to 4.9 new diagnoses per 100,000 in 2009. Conclusions: After 2003, despite of the increasing number of legally resident non-nationals in Italy, the incidence of HIV infection among non-nationals has markedly decreased. This result suggests that targeted prevention campaigns and facilitated access to testing and clinical management have been successfully implemented among non-nationals in the last decade. However, in 2009, incidence of new HIV infections among non-nationals was five-fold higher than that observed among Italians, stressing the need to reinforce the efforts aimed at reducing the circulation of HIV in this population. Background: Rising rates of HIV infections among young adults (\\30 years), mainly men having sex with men (MSM) has been observed, suggesting an increase in high-risk behaviours in this population. The aim of this study is to highlight epidemiological and behavioural characteristics of young MSM newly diagnosed with HIV infection in Lazio Region, Italy. Methods: Since January 2004, a cross sectional multi-centre study, involving 14 public counselling and testing sites, has been enrolling all adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV. At diagnosis, demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data are collected, and patients are asked to complete a questionnaire investigating socio-psycho-behavioural aspects. Individuals are identified as recent infection (RI) combining conventional laboratory methods for seroconversion with an avidity assay as antibody biomarker for RI. Among long-standing infections, we defined as having a late diagnosis individuals with a CD4 cells count \\350/mmc or clinically diagnosed with AIDS. Current guidelines recommend a standard triple ARV regimen, generally 2 NRTI + PI, as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after HIV atrisk exposures; an 'expanded' regimen could be considered in case of exposures to sources infected with multi-resistant strains, despite concerns on enhanced risk of toxicity and hence lower adherence. ARV drugs of more recent availability and for which tolerability in HIV negative subjects has not been assessed are used with extreme caution to balance between potential risks and possible benefits. In particular, scarce data are available on entry and integrase inhibitors, those offering a theoretical advantage as PEP. To assess tolerability and outcome of 'expanded' PEP regimens, we reviewed the Italian Registry of Antiretroviral PEP searching for all the treatments with[3 drugs, administered from 2004, when enfuvirtide became available, to 2010. 1,850 PEP treatments were reported, 51% occupational (799 healthcare workers), and 49% nonoccupational (710 sexual). Eight cases treated with an 'expanded' PEP regimen were identified (0.4%): five following occupational exposures (4 injuries with hollow-bore, blood filled needles and 1 eye splash with blood) plus one in a patient's relative performing a subcutaneous injection; and two after sexual exposures (vaginal insertive and anal receptive contact). All exposures involved ARV-experienced sources infected with multi-resistant strains, except one involving a patient with acute primary HIV infection who later resulted infected with a multi-resistant strain. Two sources had undetectable viremia at the time of exposure, while six had viral load ranging from 48 to 170,000,000 copies/mL. Six were coinfected with hepatitis C. Exposed subjects received 2 NRTI (6 ZDV + 3TC, 2 TDF + FTC) + 1 boosted PI (4 LPV, 1 TPV, 3 DAR) + an entry inhibitor (5 T20, 2 MVC) and/or an integrase inhibitor (3 RAL). Treatment was generally well tolerated, and all but two completed the 4-week PEP course. Two subjects interrupted PEP because of adverse effects, one at day 24 because diarrhea was accompanied by hemorrhoidal bleeding; the other at day 9 because of severe nausea and abdominal pain due to meteorism. T20 administration determined mild injection site reactions in all subjects. All subjects were HIV and HCV negative at follow-up testing after 6 months. The recourse to 'expanded' PEP is infrequent, based on the severity of exposure more than on the infectivity of the source, on the basis of documented resistance in the patient history and not necessarily on current evidence of virological failure. Broader use of new class drugs and further safety data may provide future rationale to expand its use, under close clinical and biological monitoring.

Background/objective: Co-formulated EFV/FTC/TDF is the first once daily single tablet antiretroviral (ARV) regimen approved in the United States, Canada, and the EU. The components have demonstrated long-term efficacy and safety in treatment naive patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate in clinical practice whether patients who simplified their current ARV regimen to a single tablet regimen of EFV/FTC/TDF had similar effectiveness (efficacy, safety and tolerability). Methods: We performed retrospective assessment of HIV+ patients who switched from PI containing regimens to co-formulated EFV/ FTC/TDF at our institution. 155 HIV-1+ patients have been enrolled: all patients included in the study had HIV-RNA less than 50 UI/mL at switch, median age was 47 years (IQR 40-53), male 84%, IDUs 17%, MSM 42%, heterosexuals 30%, unknown 10%, transfused 1%; 38/145 patients (26%) were HCV or HBV co-infected, 10 unknown. HIV-subtype, assessed in 101 patients, was B in 87%, non-B in 13%. Median CD4 nadir was 259 cells/mL (IQR 171-349). Thirty-one patients (20%) had AIDS history. Median time of HIV infection was 9 years (IQR 6-16). Forty-seven out of 99 patients had on historical genotype at least one major mutations for NRTI (35%), NNRTI (19%), PI (13%). Median CD4 cell count at switch was 648 cells/mL . The association of FTC, TDF and EFV was first-line therapy (Group 1) in 45 patients (29%), 61 patients (39%) had previously assumed 1 PI (Group 2), 49 patients (32%), at switch, were multi-experienced (=2 PI) (Group 3). After switch to co-formulated EFV/FTC/TDF median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 20-28). CD4, HIV-RNA, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, AST and ALT were evaluated at switch and every 3/4 months. Results and conclusions: 137 out of 155 (88.4%) patients had undetectable viremia at the end of follow-up. CD4 median monthly increase was 3 cells/ml (IQR -1/+7). Eighteen patients (12%) discontinued co-formulated EFV/FTC/TDF, four due to virological failure: two out of four developed NNRTI resistance (the first one 103N and 190A mutations) and the second one (101E and 103N mutations), one had 103N mutations on historical genotype, one failed without developing of resistance. Five patients stopped coformulated EFV/FTC/TDF treatment due to neurological efavirenz side effects, seven patients developed proteinuria and/or creatinine increase, one severe hepatic steatosis, one CPK increase. Eleven out of 18 patients (61%) who discontinued study treatment belonged to Group 3, their median age was 50 years (IQR 43-61), and 33% had AIDS diagnosis. We did not found statistically significant differences among values of transaminases, total cholesterol, triglycerides before and after co-formulated EFV/FTC/TDF switch. Aims: The introduction in clinical practice of CCR5 antagonists as a new class of entry inhibitors has determined the need to know the coreceptor usage before starting therapy. Most clinicians obtain this information through the Trofile assay, that in the last version is characterized by enhanced sensitivity (ESTA). The widespread use of this assay is impractical for the high cost and the long turnaround time. Several attempts have been made to achieve faster, cheaper and reliable results by improving genotypic interpretation algorithms. However, because of the high variability of the env region, genotypic assays can still be unreliable, while phenotypic biological assays are almost always capable of defining the actual tropism. A simple and sensitive recombinant phenotypic assay would still prove useful: the goal of the paper was to compare an in-house HIV recombinant phenotypic assay to ESTA and both phenotypic assays to the performances of a genotypic HIV-1 tropism prediction algorithm.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Methods: Recombinant DNA techniques were used to introduce a blunt-end cloning cassette in the replicating HIV-NL4-3 molecular clone in order to clone different V3 sequences from patient virus in the replicative backbone for phenotypic testing. A GFP reporter (engineered as a nef fusion product in the backbone) allowed viral replication to be determined by fluorimetric analysis of CCR5 or CXCR4 expressing cell lines following transfection. Virtual phenotype was obtained by V3-loop RNA genotype-based geno2pheno (G2P) interpretation setting false positive rate (FPR) at 10%. Results: 52 recombinant viruses were obtained from plasma samples of 21 HIV-1 patients. Coreceptor usage was analyzed in all recombinant clones indicating R5 tropism in 33 and DM/X4 tropism in 11 clones corresponding to 12 and 9 patients, respectively, a not reportable (NR) phenotype was observed in 8 viral chimerae obtained from 5 of the 21 patients. ESTA was determined in 13 out of 21 patients indicating R5 in 8, DM/X4 in 4 and NR in 1, that resulted DM/X4 by our recombinant assay. On the whole, there was perfect correspondence between the two biological assays, and between G2P prediction and ESTA. Some discrepancy was observed comparing G2P prediction of the molecular clones and their coreceptor usage. The viral chimerae from 6 out of 14 V3 loop evaluated as probably using CXCR4 by a G2P FPR\\10% showed, in fact, an R5 phenotype. Interestingly, the sequence's FPR was [5% in five of those six. Conclusions: The recombinant phenotypic assay described is highly comparable to ESTA moreover it offers the possibility to dissect the composite phenotype of viral quasispecies at the clonal level providing information about the influence of specific aminoacidic residue. Interestingly, 43% of V3 clonal sequences, predicted as probable X4 by virtual algorithm, conferred an R5 tropism when inserted into NL4-3. The threshold level of FPR should be considered with great attention. Background: Determination of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (CTR) is necessary before prescribing the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC). Consequently, studies regarding coreceptor usage in different populations are required to identify the most suitable candidates for use of MVC and its optimal allocation in antiretroviral regimens. Herein, CTR in chronic HIV-1 infected patients was evaluated together with its possible association with risk factors for the acquisition and duration of infection and the clinical and virological parameters involved. Methods: HIV-1 CTR (enhanced sensitivity trofile assay, ESTA) was evaluated in 208 drug-na\u00efve/experienced patients. ESTA was successful in 187 (90%) patients, 129 (68.9%) and 58 (31%) of whom harboured a R5 and X4 virus (either pure or dual/mixed), respectively. The association between CTR and selected variables was analyzed by means of t test, Mann-Whitney, or chi-square test, as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of CTR; interaction between nadir CD4+ count \\200 cells/mmc and antiretroviral therapy (na\u00efve, current therapy, interrupted therapy) as well as confounding and colinearity between variables were also tested. Results: Patients were mostly males (73%) of Italian origin (88%) with a mean age of 39.7 years, and according to the self-reported risk factors, included 131 (70%) sexually infected subjects (either hetero, homo or bisexuals) and 37 (19.7%) intravenous drug users (IDUs); 46 (24.5%) patients were infected with a non subtype B virus. At the time of testing, 53 (28.3%) had a AIDS diagnosis, and 99 (53%) had nadir CD4+ \\200. The median CD4+ and plasma viral load were 297 cells/ll and 4.51 log 10 HIV-RNA copies/ml, respectively. At univariate analysis, variables associated with CTR at the 0.1 level were the following: years of known HIV duration, CD4 \\200 cells/ mmc, nadir CD4, era of HIV infection (\\1997 vs. C1997), intravenous drug abuse, clade, therapy experience, AIDS diagnosis. At multivariate analysis, the only independent variable associated with CTR was nadir CD4 \\200 cells/ml with a 3.8 times increased risk (95% CI 1.76-8.58, p = 0.001) of having an X4 variant. Conclusion: Similar to recent studies, the only variable independently associated with CTR was a nadir CD4 count of \\200/ml. The close relationship between X4 and nadir CD4 further emphasizes the necessity for early HIV testing and HIV diagnoses. Moreover, it also suggests that the optimal allocation for maraviroc should be as early as possible within the initial regimens, an advice currently acceptable according to recent guidelines. Background: The aim was to evaluate antiretroviral (ARV) drugs levels during three trimesters of pregnancy, transplacental and amniotic fluid diffusion and clinical maternal and newborn outcome. Methods: Antiretroviral concentrations were determined in mother and cord blood and in amniotic fluid by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cord-to-mother ratio (C:M) was calculated to estimate the ARVs placental passage. HIV viral load and CD4 cell count values were recorded in first, second, third trimester and at delivery. Newborn gestational age, weight, Apgar score and complications were recorded at birth. Results: Seventy-three HIV-infected pregnant women were enrolled. Maternal nevirapine (NVP, n = 14) mean Ctrough was 3,629 \u00b1 956 ng/mL with a mean C:M ratio of 0.68 \u00b1 0.1 and amniotic fluid level of 1,257 ng/mL obtained from one sample; maternal nelfinavir (NFV, n = 7) Ctrough was 837 \u00b1 673 ng/mL with a mean C:M ratio of 0.58 \u00b1 0.18; maternal atazanavir (ATV, n = 8) Ctrough was 1,309 \u00b1 609 ng/mL with a mean C:M ratio of 0.20 \u00b1 0.17 and mean amniotic fluid level of 286 \u00b1 47 ng/mL; maternal saquinavir (SQV, n = 2) Ctrough was 903 \u00b1 137 ng/mL with a mean C:M ratio of 0.13 \u00b1 0.03; maternal fosamprenavir (FPV, n = 6) Ctrough was 696 \u00b1 401 ng/mL with a mean C:M ratio of 0.18 \u00b1 0.09 and mean amniotic fluid level of 468 \u00b1 58 ng/mL; maternal lopinavir (LPV, n = 31) Ctrough was 4,113 \u00b1 2,465 ng/mL with C:M ratio 0.1 \u00b1 0.2 and mean amniotic fluid level of 198 \u00b1 125 ng/mL; maternal darunavir (DRV, n = 5) Ctrough was 2,014 \u00b1 1,549 ng/mL with a mean C:M ratio of 0.12 \u00b1 0.04 and mean amniotic fluid level of 403 \u00b1 437 ng/mL. ATV, DRV and FPV were more concentrated in amniotic fluid than in cord blood. The observed prevalence rate of neonatal low birth weight (LBW, \\2,500 g) and preterm delivery (PTD, \\37 week) was 22% (n = 16) and 17.8% (n = 13), respectively. LBW and PTD was observed in 14.3% (n = 2) newborns of mothers treated with NVP.; in 25.8% (n = 8) and 42.9% (n = 3), respectively of newborns exposed to LPV; in 28.6% (n = 2) and 42.9% (n = 3), respectively of newborns exposed to NFV, in 37.5% (n = 3) and 12.5% (n = 1)), respectively of newborns exposed to ATV, in 20% (n = 1) of those exposed to DRV.

Background: No long-term data are available on anthropometric and body compositional changes in HIV-infected children and adolescents switching from stavudine (d4T) to tenofovir (TDF) and from protease inhibitor (PI) to efavirenz (EFV). Methods: Twenty-four (12 males) HIV-infected children and adolescents aged 5-18 years were switched from a regimen based on lamivudine + d4T + PI to one containing lamivudine + TDF and EFV. Anthropometry and body composition were evaluated yearly for six consecutive years after the switch. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Outcomes of interest were weight, height, body mass index (BMI), body fat, percent body fat (body fat/body mass), percent arm fat (arm fat/body fat), percent leg fat (leg fat/body fat) and percent trunk fat (trunk fat/body fat). Mixed linear regression was used to model the outcome-time relationships of interest using baseline age and gender as covariates, the patient as random coefficient, and time as random slope. Missing data (11 of 168 time-points) were handled by the mixed model. Results: All patients maintained the antiretroviral regimen introduced after the switch. HIV-RNA steadily persisted \\50 cp/mL in most cases; three subjects showed transitory HIV-RNA blips (73-456 cp/ mL). Stable CD4 T-cell counts were observed in all cases during the study period. The yearly mean change in weight, height and BMI was 2.5 (95% CI 1. Conclusions: During a 6-year follow-up, patients who switched from d4T to TDF and from PI to EFV showed anthropometric changes compatible with normal growth and development. In addition, their total and appendicular fat masses were substantially stable during this period.

Background: The risk of insulin resistance in HIV-infected patients under HAART stems from exposure to the same environmental factors that have led to an increased incidence of these conditions in the general population and from the negative effects on glucose metabolism inherent to components of antiretroviral regimens.

Methods: Pts on ATV/r + 2NRTI, without previous treatment failure or resistance to PI or LAM, with HIV-RNA\\50 c/mL for[3 months, CD4 [200 cells for [6 months, HBsAg-negative and ATV plasma levels [ efficacy thresholds were eligible. Study was designed to enroll 40 pts. At baseline (BL), regimens were simplified to ATV/r 300/100 mg qd + LAM 300 mg qd. Pts were monitored at 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 weeks. Adherence to drugs, belief in therapy, self-reported symptoms and HRQoL were assessed at BL and 48 weeks. A Symptom Score was built summing self-reported scores for each of 19 listed symptoms with range from to 76) Results: 40 pts enrolled (57% M, 22% IDU, 22% AIDS), with median age 45 years, time since HIV-RNA \\50 c/mL 663 days (IQR 320-895), CD4 count 598 cells/lL (472-777). 39 pts discontinued tenofovir, 1 abacavir. Data were reported on 38/40 patients who reached 48 weeks. 2/38 pts had virological failure (both without resistance mutations, undetectable plasma ATV and successfully reinduced with 2NRTI). Median CD4 change was +33 cells/lL (p = 0.24).Six severe adverse events were recorded (4 renal colic, 1 hypertensive crisis, 1 brain hemorrhage). Adherence was stably optimal during the study (83.7 at BL and 82.9 at 48 weeks; p = 0.85). A significant improvement in total physical (p = 0.002) and mental health scores (p \\ 0.001) was observed but not in the self-reported symptom score (p = 0.34). At multivariable analysis, the change in physical health was independently correlated to physical health at BL (B coeff -0.78; 95% CI -1.04; -0.53, p \\ 0.001) and symptom score at BL (B coeff -0.77; 95% CI -1.34; -0.22, p = 0.008) while the change in the mental health to age (B coeff -0.79; 95% CI -1.18; -0.41, p \\ 0.001) and mental health at BL (B coeff -0.60; 95% CI -0.85; -0.34, p \\ 0.001). Change in belief in therapy was significantly correlated to mental health but only at univariate analysis (B coeff 6.23; 95% CI 0.73; 11.73, p = 0.03) Conclusion: Simplification to ATV/r + LAM qd was correlated to an increase in both physical and mental health. This effect does not seem mediated by an improvement in the self-reported Symptom score even though the small sample size could not allow definite considerations. Adherence remained optimal over time. Background: Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and lipodystrophy are common in HIV-1-infected individuals and represent a challenge in the clinical and therapeutic management. Different studies found an association between use of tenofovir and bone damage and a higher incidence of fracture. Methods: In ATLAS, a prospective single-arm pilot study evaluating simplification from 2 NRTI + ATV/r to 3TC + ATV/r (Fabbiani et al., XVIII International AIDS Conference 2010, Abstract THLBB207), BMD, limb fat (DXA) and facial adipose tissue (ultrasound) were measured at baseline (BL) and 48 weeks. Additional parameters assessed were demographics, type(s) and duration of prior antiretroviral therapy, lipodystrophy (overall and by region), CD4 counts, fasting metabolic parameters, markers of bone metabolism. Results: Forty patients were enrolled (57% M, 22% IDU, 22% AIDS), with median age 45 years, time since HIV-RNA \\50 c/mL 663 days (IQR 320-895), CD4 count 598 cells/mmc (472-777). 39 patients discontinued tenofovir, 1 abacavir. At analysis, 38/40 patients had reached 48 weeks. In 33 evaluable patients the calcium concentration, PTH and vitamin D did not show significant modifications from BL at 48 weeks, whereas significant changes of osteocalcin (mean -12 ng/mL; p \\ 0.001) and alkaline phosphatase (mean -40 UI/L; p \\ 0.001) were observed. There was an increase of cheek subcutaneous fat (n = 35; mean +0.54 g; p = 0.04) and upper limbs (n = 35; mean +145 g; p = 0.003), but not lower limbs fat. BMD (n = 35) showed a trend towards an increase in L2-L4 (+0.01 g/cm 2 ; p = 0.06) but not in the proximal femurs nor in other districts, where there was no significant change. No patient had had a fracture since being infected with HIV. Osteoporosis (t score \\-2.5 SD below normal) at BL and 48 weeks was found in 3 (7%) and in 3 (8%) and osteopenia (t score -1.0 to -2.5 SD) in 16 (40%) and 13 (38%), respectively. The only factor associated with osteopenia or osteoporosis (logistic regression) was older age (OR 2.56 per 10 years older; 95% CI 1.05-6.25; p = 0.04). Conclusion: The switch from ATV/r + 2 NRTI to ATV/r + 3TC was associated with improved bone mineral density and bone metabolism markers and with increased subcutaneous fat in several districts. Introduction: Combined antiretroviral therapy (c-ART) has reduced mortality of HIV infected patients. Due to the prolonged survival many co-morbidities have rose up and a high prevalence of osteoporosis has been reported. Aim: To investigate medical consciousness of osteoporosis as a comorbidity and the resources commonly used to make the diagnosis. Methods: The survey has been sent to most of the Italian centres treating HIV infection and 20 of them have filled it up as yet. Results: A mean of 695 patients are currently treated with c-ART in the surveyed centres. In the first semester of 2010 a mean of 28 na\u00efve patients initiated c-ART in each centre. Eleven (55%) centres usually perform a screening for osteoporosis in selected patients. Screenings are significantly more frequent (p = 0.012) in the centres following guidelines, and the most used selection criteria are previous fractures (70%), use of steroids (60%) and low BMI (45%). DXA measurement is the preferred diagnostic tool, but 85% of the centres complains for a difficult access to it. Almost all the centres measure calcium (95%), phosphate (95%) and vitamin D (85%). PTH is dosed in 65% of the centres while 70% of them measure at least one marker of bone turnover (60% in order to monitor the toxic effect of c-ART and 45% to evaluate the toxic effect of HIV). The estimation of the relative risk of fracture is chosen by 45% of the centres, while 15% of them use markers to choose an appropriate anti-osteoporosis therapy and 30%", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion: Use of new generation antiretroviral drugs in Italian"}, {"text": "ICAR 2011: Abstracts to monitor the follow up of this treatment. The presence of a diagnosis of osteoporosis drives the choice of c-ART in almost all the centres, both in na\u00efve (80%) and in experienced (85%) patients. Among comorbidities osteoporosis is perceived as a severe one by the 5% of the centres, while 30% consider it a moderate complication and 45% a mild one. Discussion: This preliminary results confirm that a pathway dedicated to the diagnosis of osteoporosis is felt as a necessity only by eleven centres and that their attention is driven by the recommendations of guidelines. Although recommended by guidelines and notwithstanding HIV infection is a cause of secondary osteoporosis, the lack of diagnostic tools forces clinicians toward a selection of the patients for DXA screening: only the most severe patients are screened. This selection is performed on the basis of previous fractures, use of steroids and low BMI, but HIV-specific risk are scarcely taken into consideration. Almost all the centres evaluate calcium/phosphate metabolism and vitamin D status. Half of the centres measure bone turnover markers even though their motivation (monitoring the toxic effect of HIV and c-ART) are not those supported by scientific evidence (RR of fracture and therapeutic monitoring). Finally, notwithstanding the growing evidence of a strong association between osteoporosis and both cardiovascular and renal disease in HIV only one centre considers bone disease as a severe co-morbidity. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been recognized as strongly associated to anal as well as to cervical carcinoma; however, to date, much less is known about factors influencing anal HPV persistence and progression. Anal cancer rates in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individual have continued to increase over the past decade, despite the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The risk of development of anal carcinoma in HIV-positive women has been estimated to be at 5-8 times higher than that of HIV-negative women. Even so, the role of HPV-type specific infection and viral load in anal lesions in women have been addressed in a few studies. Hence, the aim of this study was to monitor HIV-positive women anal infections, determining the prevalence of HPV genotypes in anal and cervical brushings and related type-specific HPV loads. Anal brushings were collected in a proctology clinic (Umberto I University Hospital, Rome) from 18 HIV-positive women: a cervical brushing was taken as well. The presence of specific HPV genotypes in anal and cervical brushings was determined by two different PCR assays followed by sequencing, a method that allows the identification of a wide range of HPV types. Type-specific viral load was measured using a quantitative real-time PCR fluorogenic assay with TaqMan probes and primers designed for 14 HPV genotypes in the E6 genomic region. The prevalence of HPV infection in anal samples were higher than in cervical samples (28 vs. 11%). HPV genotypes detected in anal samples were: HPV 6 (2 cases), HPV 16, HPV 31 and HPV 62 (1 case each), and in cervical samples HPVs 6, 54 and 55 (1 case each). Considering the women with concurrent anal and cervical HPV infection, the simultaneous presence of the same genotype occurred only in 1 out of 3 women. HPV-type specific DNA load was determined in most samples: HPV number of copies was not related to HPV type of risk (low/high). In cervical HPV-negative samples corresponding to an anal sample resulted HPV-positive, measurement of the HPV load of the genotype infecting the anal site gave negative results. Our study showed a high prevalence of HPV anal infection in HIV-positive female patients. Anal infection without concomitant cervical infection suggested different routes of acquisition or different rates of persistence. The frequency of high-risk HPVs in anal samples supported the need to develop HPV screening programs in anal brushings from HIV-positive women.

Results: We found that in contrast to healthy control group, progressors had lower number of peripheral blood Treg cells accompanied by higher percentage of Th17 cells and higher density of CXCR4 receptor on CD4+ CD25-T cells. The expression of CCR4, CCR7, CD62L on Treg cells and the status of their activation (CD45RA and RO) was not different between healthy controls and HIV infected patients. Analyses of array of genes involved in Treg/ Th17 differentiation did not show differences between LTNP and progressors but in several genes between progressors and healthy controls. In peripheral blood, mononuclear cells of progressors had significantly higher levels of expression of CEPB, IL-1b, IL-8, ISG20, SOCS3, and TNF, and lower expression of CD40L in comparison to healthy controls. Conclusions: The number of Treg cells but not selected characteristics of these cells are significantly associated with more severe progression of HIV infection and their lower number in peripheral blood in comparison to healthy controls might be due to high accumulation in lymphoid tissues and/or higher susceptibility to HIV cell death. Lower number of Treg cells might contribute to higher immune activation status found in progressors as seen by high number of Th17 cells and expression of several genes that were significantly upregulated or downregulated only between progressors and healthy controls. We conclude that decrease in number of peripheral blood Treg cells concomitant with increased numbers of Th17 cells might be observed only in patients whose HIV progresses rapidly. Such a changes are not apparent in LTNP and distinguishable from healthy controls thus making difficult to conclude about the kinetics of imbalance between immunosuppression and immunoactivation mediated by these two cell subpopulations. Background: antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been shown to interfere with several parameters involved in homeostasis of metabolic and inflammatory pathways, as well as with cell proliferation. Innate immune function may be variably influenced by antiretrovirals targeting different viral and metabolic pathways. We studied peripheral NK cells in patients on different ART regimens to understand their possible modulation of the immune response in vivo. An in vitro model was developed to verify correlates of activity. Patients and methods: patients on successful treatment with ART regimens (VL \\50 cp/ml for at least 12 months) were enrolled. Raltegravir (RAL)-, Abacavir (ABC)-or Tenofovir (TDF)-containing triple-drug regimens were considered for patients on PI treatment. NK cell function and phenotype were studied by flow-cytometry. In vitro culture of healthy donor NK cells in the presence of corresponding regimens were evaluated. Results: Patients (no. 24) falling into the 3 treatment groups were enrolled. All but 1 patient in each group had suppressed VL at the time of analysis. Mean CD4+ cell counts were comparable in ABC and TDF and were lower in RAL patients (21.56 \u00b1 11.1; 24.54 \u00b1 20.09; 18 \u00b1 5.19) respectively. Among patients in ABC and TDF, NKp46 (39.02 \u00b1 11.65; 46.82 \u00b1 24.06, respectively), NKp30 (8.67 \u00b1 6.47; 9.88 \u00b1 7.15 respectively), NKG2D (49.31 \u00b1 17.34; 48.17 \u00b1 26.44, respectively) and DNAM-1 (74.94 \u00b1 10.08; 80.07 \u00b1 5.67 respectively) activating NK cell receptor expression was comparable. Non-KIR inhibitory receptors (CD85j, NKG2A/ CD94) were comparable in patients belonging to the two groups. Evidences for increased NK cell activation (HLA-DR expression) and decreased cytotoxicity and IFNc production were observed among patients in TDF compared to ABC patients. Patients in RAL group had more advanced disease according to CD4+ proportions and absolute counts, as expected. However, they had the least activation of NK cells (as defined by HLA-DR expression), when compared to patients in ABC or TDF groups (27.46 \u00b1 18.19; 31.62 \u00b1 12.53; 45.67 \u00b1 11.21 respectively) . Reduced proportions of activating receptor expression were also recorded in this group (NKp30: 0.75 \u00b1 0.41; NKG2D: 27.28 \u00b1 20.5, , when compared to the other patients. In addition, they showed decreased inhibitory receptor expression on NK cells (CD85j, NKG2A/CD94) compared to the other patients. Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that among stably treated patients on different ART regimens, antiretroviral drugs may exert different immunomodulating effects in addition to their primary antiretroviral activity. Effects on NK cells may affect the antigen presentation and adaptive (T and B cell) immune response to HIV itself and other recall antigens, as well as to new antigens (e.g. vaccination, tumor). Once confirmed and extended on larger patient groups, knowledge of ART effects on innate immune mechanisms may be suitably exploited in HIV patients according to clinical Background: We evaluated if factors related to viral dynamics (i.e. time to reach first HIV-RNA \\50 cps/mL and blips occurrence) may influence the magnitude of long-term CD4 recovery in fully suppressed subjects treated with first line HAART.

Given the effects of DRV (anti-apoptotic activity) and MVC (down-modulation of chemotaxis), our in vitro findings encourage studies assessing the impact on immunologic response of regimens including these two antiretroviral drugs. Our previous studies have reported an association between cellassociated HIV-1 DNA levels, plasma HIV-1 RNA load and CD4+ T cell counts in highly active antiretroviral naive HIV-1 patients. In the framework of a study aimed at monitoring markers of AIDS progression, we evaluated HIV-DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from long-term HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients. HIV-DNA levels were quantified in serial PBMCs samples from 47 HIV-1 infected patients before and after 8, 13, 21, 27, 35, 42, 47 , 59 months of HAART, using quantitative real-time PCR. Also, we compared changes of cellular HIV-DNA level with concomitant variations in plasma viral load and CD4+ T cell counts. Results showed that after 5 year of antiretroviral therapy, cellular HIV DNA declined significantly by a median of tenfold. Furthermore we found that plasma viremia decreased along with the decay of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA levels during antiviral treatment. As expected an inverse correlation between HIV-DNA levels in PBMCs and CD4+ T cell counts was found. Interestingly cellular HIV DNA levels measured in HIV-1 infected patients during antiviral therapy were influenced by pre-HAART levels of HIV-DNA in PBMCs. Specifically a lower baseline levels of HIV-DNA correlates with lower levels of HIV-DNA during HAART therapy (and viceversa). It should be also noted that some patients experienced a reduction in HIV-DNA to undetectable levels while others had detectable HIV-DNA levels even in presence of plasma viremia \\50 copies/ml. This observation suggests that low levels of viral replication and/or residual cellular reservoir might persist also during an effective HAART treatment in different extent between patients. All together these findings reinforce the importance of HIV-DNA evaluation, in addition to HIV-RNA and CD4+ T cell counts, in physiopathological and therapeutical studies, particularly in an era of research aimed at diminishing the HIV reservoir. Even if blood represents a small part of this reservoir, our study suggests that HIV-DNA in blood is a reliable marker that provides useful informations on the effectiveness of treatment and on entity of cellular reservoir. Objectives: To assess performances of the recently introduced Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 version 2 (CAP/CTM-2) with a detection limit of 20 copies/ml compared with the Cobas Ampliprep/ Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 version 1 (CAP/CTM-1, lower detection limit 40 copies/ml), in plasma specimens from HIV-1 infected individuals that experienced undetectable or low but detectable viremia. Methods: Two-hundred samples consisting of two sets were selected and tested with the two PCR techniques. The first set (n = 122) included samples with HIV-1 RNA undetectable or \\40 copies/ml measured with CAP/CTM-1 and the second one (n = 78) of samples with HIV-1 RNA between 20 and 40 copies/ml with CAP/CTM-2. Replicates of a serially diluted HIV-1 RNA standard (Acrometrix, Benecia, US) from 107 to 2 copies/ml has been used to evaluate the sensitivity of CAP/CTM-2. Test reproducibility has been assessed on replicates of 146 CAP/CTM-2 positive samples with HIV-1 RNA between 21 and 200 copies/ml. In those patients reporting an undetectable HIV-1 RNA or \\40 copies/ml with CAP/CTM-1 and a positive results with CAP/ CTM-2, viral evolution over time was evaluated with a longitudinal analysis covering one-year follow-up after the undetectable measurement with CAP/CTM-1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 869, "end": 872, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 877, "end": 880, "text": "27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 881, "end": 884, "text": "35,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 885, "end": 888, "text": "42,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 889, "end": 891, "text": "47", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S58"}, {"text": "Results: Concordance between the two tests was 66% (132/200 concordant samples) with 68 discordant samples; in 55 samples HIV-1 RNA was undetectable (target not detected, TND) with CAP/CTM-1 but detectable with CAP/CTM-2 (21-304 copies/ml); in 13 samples HIV-1 RNA was\\40 copies/ml with CAP/CTM-1 but[40 copies/ml with CAP/CTM-2 (44-831 copies/ml). As overall, HIV-1 RNA was undetectable (TND) with CAP/CTM-1 and CAP/CTM-2 in 111 (55.5%) and 50 (25%) specimens, respectively and detectable in 89 (44.5, 12.5% of them within the test linear range) and 150 (75, 62% of them within the test linear range) samples with CAP/CTM-1 and CAP/CTM-2, respectively.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk among patients treated for more than 5 years with regimens based on nevirapine or efavirenz. Patients and methods: A total of 276 patients were retrospectively evaluated, 156 of whom were treated with nevirapine and 120 with efavirenz, by examining traditional risk factors and detecting the presence of subclinical carotid lesions with colour-Doppler ultrasonography. Results: When comparing the data at baseline and follow-up in the nevirapine group, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and triglycerides showed a significant decrease, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased. Ultrasound data, obtained in a subgroup of 67 patients, did not show significant changes for those treated with nevirapine. In the efavirenz group, total cholesterol, LDLc, triglycerides, glycaemia, body mass index and the number of patients with a pathological ultrasound significantly increased. When comparing the two groups at baseline and follow-up, nevirapine patients had significantly higher values of total cholesterol, LDLc and triglycerides at baseline, while total cholesterol and LDLc differed non-significantly at follow-up; triglycerides became significantly lower in the nevirapine arm with respect to the efavirenz group. Glycaemia was comparable between the two groups at baseline, while it was significantly lower in the nevirapine group at follow-up. The number of pathological ultrasound findings was significantly higher in the efavirenz group at follow-up. Conclusions: Patients treated with nevirapine demonstrated a better lipid and glucose profile and a lower tendency to develop subclinical atherosclerotic lesions.

The identification of susceptible individuals prior to the institution of abacavir therapy is therefore of clinical importance and has generated the demand for a simple and rapid test to identify the HLA-B*5701 allele. Aim: In this work we compared a method based on allele-specific real-time PCR and melting curve analysis (AS-PCR) with the direct sequencing based typing (SBT), that is the gold standard method for identifying HLA-B*5701 allele. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted by whole blood using the NucliSENS easyMAG (NeM, BioMerieux, France) a semi-automated platform with an extraction protocol based on magnetic-silica particles, according to the manufacturer's instruction. To identify the HLA-B*5701 allele we used a commercial test based on allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and melting curve analysis (AS-PCR, Duplica Real Time HLA-B*5701 Genotyping Kit, Euroclone, Italy) compared with the direct sequencing kit HLA*B5701 Sequence Based Typing (SBT, Abbott, Italy) as gold standard. Results: We analysed 46 patient samples with SBT: 9 resulted HLA-B*5701-positive while 37 were HLA-B*5701-negative samples that included closely related HLA-B*5701 alleles -B*5702 (n = 1), -B*5703 (n = 4), -B*5301 (n = 3) and B*5801 (n = 3). With AS-PCR, we obtained the same results of SBT test: 9 samples HLA-B*5701-positive and 37 HLA-B*5701-negative. All 11 closely related HLA-B*5701 samples were identified as HLA-B*5701-negative. Compared with SBT, this method had 100% sensitivity and specificity for the HLA-B*5701 allele. Conclusion: The method based on allele-specific real-time PCR positively identified all HLA-B*5701 alleles in concordance with their SBT-assigned typing and was able to distinguish between HLA-B*5701, closely related HLA-B*57 alleles and non-HLA-B*57 alleles and gave results in one working-day. In conclusion, this method is a rapid, sensitive, specific and may be suitable for large or small scale screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele. Background: The work describes the association between the HLAB5701 and the hypersensitivity to Abacavir in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The HLAB57 family consists of at least 16 related genes and gene products 5701 were associated with hypersensitivity to Abacavir. For these reasons, in March 2008 was reached an agreement between the ERA and AIFA on a screening to detect the HLAB5701 before starting Abacavir treatment in the patients with HIV1. At the end of this study the presence of the allele was associated with a lower viral load in some patients HIV1 positive. The clinical validity of this screening is, therefore, in the identification of HIV patients potentially subjected to hypersensitivity reaction to Abacavir. Methods: The aim of the work was to verify the HLAB5701 in African and European patients, using a genetic test. The method used is a real-time PCR for HLAB5701. The test is based on two major processes: isolation of genomic DNA from specimens and real-time amplification with allele specific primers.

HLAB5701 RealTM PCR kit is a qualitative test; it contains the Internal Control IC (beta-globine gene), which allows the control the presence of cellular material in the sample. Results: 44 patients, also from continents other than Europe, including 34 males and 10 females, aged between 20 and 64 years were subjected to screening for the determination of the HLAB5701. Only 4 patients, of Caucasian origin, were positive; of the 40 negative people only 12 were from European (27.3%), confirming that this allele in Africa occurs with a frequency much lower than in the European continent. From the positive cases in only one patient was found the allele associated with low viral load. This could be a rare case of long-term non progressor, or of a patient in which the virus has a high replicative activity. In such case, the presence of the allele should not be considered a negative factor, correlated to a possible treatment failure but rather represents a case of slow progression of the infection, which can be maintained for decades. Conclusions: The correlation between HLAB5701 and hypersensitivity to abacavir leads to the conclusion that this reaction is certainly due to a genetic component, not attributable, however, to the presence of one allele, but probably endogenous and/or environmental factor still to be clarified. Therefore, the screening of HLAB5701 is crucial for the patients not yet receiving antiretroviral therapy with Trizivir. Moreover a positive result to this test is necessary but not sufficient to establish the development of the Hypersensitivity Abacavir, but only to the increased susceptibility to this reaction. Therefore the test is predictive but not diagnostic for the development of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Background: The role of HIV infection in bone mineral is incompletely characterized, and studies are needed to identify the underlying mechanisms.

Background: Despite the availability of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), minor cognitive disorders are increasingly recognized in HIV-infected patients. The longer duration of HIV disease, as a consequence of HAART, together with an older age at seroconversion, may increase the risk for cognitive impairment. Aim of the study was to explore the interactions between aging and HIV infection in the expression of cognitive decay. Methods: A cross-sectional single cohort study was performed, consecutively enrolling asymptomatic HIV+ subjects during routine outpatient visits. All patients underwent an extensive Neuropsychological Battery. A control population of 36 HIV-negative individuals matched for age and education was also selected. Comparisons between groups were based on Mann-Whitney U test; to control for the probability of committing a type I error in multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was adopted by setting the p value at 0.003. The impact of aging and HIV infection on neuropsychological performance was investigated by factorial analysis of variance. Results: One hundred fifty-three patients [59.5% males, median age 47 (IQR 41-56) years, 13.1% older than 65 years, median education 12.0 (IQR 8-14.5) years, 25% with past AIDS-defining events (non neurological), 77.8% with HIV-RNA\\50 copies/mL, median CD4 cells count 518 (IQR 380-703), 88.2% on HAART] were enrolled.

Moreover, comparing younger HIV+ patients (age\\65; N = 133) with older control subjects (age C 5 years, N = 20), no significant difference was found in the neuropsychological performance obtained at each test, with the exception of better scores obtained by younger HIV+ patients on the Trail Making Test B (time) (p = 0.001) and Stroop Test (time) (p = 0.001).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Material and methods:"}, {"text": "Discussion: Data available in the literature about the interaction of aging and HIV on cognitive status are not uniform.

Alexithymia, an impairment of affective and cognitive emotional processing, is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may reflect effects of the virus on several brain areas. We hypothesized that there would be a correlation between extent of alexithymia and cognitive performance including attention, executive functions, speed of information processing, verbal fluency, memory, and verbal learning. HIV infected patients were consecutively enrolled from November, 2010 to January, 2011. We investigated a several psychological factors, including Alexithymia, using the 20-item Toronto-Alexithymia-Scale (TAS-20, cut-off = 61), Type-D personality using the DS14 Distress Scale (Negative Affectivity Scale, cut-off = 9; Social Inhibition Scale, cut-off = 9), Depression symptoms, using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II, cutoff = 15) and QoL, with PCS (Physical Component Summary) and MCS (Mental Component Summary) using the SF12 questionnaire. Background: Due to the high genetic barrier of Ritonavir-boosted Darunavir (DRV), resistance to this drug is associated with multiple mutational profiles. We used a large database of HIV patient, who were treated with a DRV-containing regimen after treatment failure to investigate protease (PR) evolution under DRV therapy. Methods: Data were collected from patients included in the Italian ARCA database with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) done within 3 months before DRV start. The protease mutational pattern before and after DRV failure was analysed according to IAS-USA criteria. Results: A total of 840 pre-treated patients were included: 759 (89%) patients had still undetectable viral load after a median of 54 weeks (IQR 23-112) of DRV-containing regimen and 81 (9.5%) experienced virological failure (median 43 weeks, IQR 18-62). Baseline GRT of the 81 failing patients had a mean of 3.2 \u00b1 2.0 major PR mutations as compared to 2.5 \u00b1 1.9 in patients without failure. A significantly higher proportion of specific PR mutations was detected, including V32I (21.0 vs. 7.6%, p = 0.0048); I47V (24.7 vs. 10.3%, p = 0.0003); I54M (12.3 vs. 4.3%, p = 0.0043); I84V (40.7 vs. 27.5%, p = 0.0018). Moreover, in the 81 failing patients, comparing baseline and failure GRT, the following mutations increased in frequency: V32I (40.7% at failure vs. 21.0% at baseline); I50V (12.3 vs. 4.9%); I54L (27.9 vs. 7.4%); Q58E (22.2 vs. 14.8%) and T74P (7.4 vs. 3 .7%). The mean number of mutations per patient increased from 3.2 at baseline to 3.6 (\u00b1 2.2) at DRV-failure. Using the Stanford interpretation algorithm, at baseline, none of the failing patients harboured a virus that was fully resistant to DRV, 39 (48.1%) had intermediate resistance and 45 (55.6%) were fully susceptible, 18 of which (22.2%) having no PR resistance mutation. At DRV failure, only 2 patients (2.5%) had developed full resistance to the drug, 45 (55.6%) had intermediate resistance and 33 (40.7%) were still susceptible to DRV, 15 (18.5%) patients without any PR mutation. Conclusions: In this cohort analysis, protease mutations associated with reduced virological response to DRV were in agreement with", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2814, "end": 2824, "text": "(7.4 vs. 3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Material and methods:"}, {"text": "ICAR 2011: Abstracts currently used algorithms. However, susceptibility to DRV was generally maintained even in the presence of virological failure of regimens containing the drug. Indeed, for the Stanford interpretation algorithm, full resistance to DRV is uncommon, so that most patients retained partial or complete DRV susceptibility with several patients lacking any protease mutation. Background: For patients on treatment with HIV RNA \\50 copies/ mL, it is unknown whether the genetic barrier to evolution of resistance is different for DRV/r monotherapy, compared with standard triple combinations of antiretrovirals. Several minor IAS-USA mutations are detected frequently in samples from PI na\u00efve patients. Methods: In the MONET trial, 256 patients with no history of virological failure and HIV RNA \\50 copies/mL on current HAART (NNRTI based (43%), or PI based (57%) switched to either DRV/r monotherapy (800/100 mg OD) versus DRV/r + 2NRTIs. HIV RNA levels were evaluated at Weeks 2, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96: all patient samples with HIV RNA above 50 copies/mL were sent for genotypic resistance analysis (VircoTYPE HIV-1, Beerse, Belgium). Virtual phenotype was also assessed when PI mutations were detected. The percentage of patients with major or minor IAS-USA PI mutations was analysed by treatment arm. Results: Patients were 81% male and 91% Caucasian, with median age 43 years, and median CD4 count of 575 cells/lL. While patients were receiving randomised treatment, HIV RNA was above 50 copies/mL for 47/1,051 (4.5%) patient-visits in the DRV/r + 2NRTI arm and 69/1,009 (6.8%) patient-visits in the DRV/r monotherapy arm. Of 48 patients with at least one successful genotype (27 in the DRV/r monotherapy arm, 21 in the DRV/r + 2NRTI arm), two showed major IAS-USA PI mutations during short-term elevations in HIV RNA (one per treatment arm). Both patients remained phenotypically sensitive to darunavir, with sustained HIV RNA\\50 copies/mL during the trial and no change in antiretroviral treatment. The five most common minor IAS-USA mutations detected in the DRV/r mono and DRV/r + 2NRTI arms were L63P (78, 62% respectively), I93L (59%, 19%), V77I (33, 43%), I62V (22, 33%) and I64V (15, 24%). These five mutations were also commonly observed in the Stanford HIV database of 7,601 samples from PI naive patients. Fourteen patients in the DRV/r monotherapy arm had repeated genotypes during intermittent low-level viraemia-there was no evidence for evolution of minor IAS-USA PI mutations over time in these patients. Conclusions: After 96 weeks of treatment in the MONET trial, there is no evidence for an increased risk of emergence of major or minor IAS-USA PI mutations with DRV/r monotherapy, compared to DRV/r + 2 NRTIs, and no evidence for evolution of PI mutations after repeated genotyping. Background: In the Phase III, randomised, open-label ODIN trial, treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adults with no screening DRV resistance-associated mutations received DRV/r 800/100 mg qd or DRV/r 600/100 mg bid (both arms + =2 NRTIs). At Week 48, 72.1% qd versus 70.9% bid patients achieved HIV-1 RNA \\50 copies/mL (95% CI -6.1 to 8.5%, p \\ 0.001; ITT-TLOVR), confirming non inferiority of DRV/r qd. The relationship between DRV PK and efficacy and safety following treatment with DRV/r is explored. Methods: Sparse blood sampling for PK evaluations was taken at Weeks 4, 8, 24 and 48 to determine DRV trough concentrations (C0h) and exposure (AUC24h, calculated as AUC12h x 2 for bid) using a population pharmacokinetic model. Relationships between PK parameters and efficacy [change in log 10 HIV-1 RNA and virological response (HIV-1 RNA \\50 copies/mL)] were assessed using ANCOVAs. Relationships between PK parameters and occurrence of adverse events of interest and laboratory lipid abnormalities were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Results: PK data were available for 280 DRV/r qd patients and 278 bid patients. Median (range) C0h was 1,896 (184-7,881 ) ng/mL for DRV/r qd and 3,197 (250-11,865) ng/mL for DRV/r bid. Median (range) AUC24h for DRV/r qd was 87,788 (45,456-236,920) ng h/ mL and 109,401 (48,934-323,820) ng h/mL for bid. No relevant relationships were observed between DRV PK and efficacy: changes from baseline in HIV-1 RNA log 10 copies/mL at Week 48 for pooled data by DRV AUC24 h quartile ranges (=79,576; 79,577-100,376; 100,377-119,356 ; [119,356 ng h/mL) were -2.06, -2.22, -2.19, and -2.08 log 10 copies/mL, respectively. The % patients achieving HIV-1 RNA \\50 copies/mL by these quartile ranges were 82.0, 88.5, 82.6 and 76.5% (observed data), respectively. In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for baseline viral load, AAG levels and number of sensitive NRTIs in the optimized background regimen, there were no relevant relationships between PK and virological response. No apparent relationships were observed between DRV PK and occurrence of rash-, cardiac-, GI-, liver-, lipid-and glucose-related AEs or laboratory lipid abnormalities. Conclusions: Dosing with DRV/r 800/100 mg qd resulted in lower C0h and AUC24h compared to DRV/r 600/100 mg bid; however, comparable efficacy between DRV/r qd and bid confirmed adequate DRV concentrations were achieved following qd dosing. No relevant relationships were observed between DRV PK and efficacy or safety at Week 48. Background: The open-label, Phase III, ODIN trial randomised treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients with no DRV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) to receive DRV/r 800/100 mg qd or DRV/r 600/100 mg bid, plus an optimized background regimen (=2 NRTIs). Non-inferiority in the primary endpoint of virological response at Week 48 was demonstrated with DRV/r qd versus bid dosing: 72.1 versus 70.9% of patients, respectively, achieved HIV-1 RNA \\50 copies/mL (95% CI -6.1, 8.5; p \\ 0.001; ITTTLOVR). The current analysis explores patient-reported HRQoL. Methods: Treatment-experienced patients with no DRV RAMs at screening and HIV-1 RNA [1,000 copies/mL were randomised. Patient-reported HRQoL was measured with the Functional Assessment of HIV-infection (FAHI) questionnaire at baseline and at Weeks 4, 12, 24 and 48 (or withdrawal visit). FAHI score at Week 48 was modeled by means of an ANCOVA, and the evolution of the FAHI score over time by means of a longitudinal mixed model, each with treatment as a factor and CD4 and baseline HIV-1 RNA as a regressor. FAHI response was defined as the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful difference (relative increase of 10%) in total FAHI imputed score versus baseline. Results: HRQoL data were available for 262/294 DRV/r qd and 268/296 DRV/r bid patients. The baseline total FAHI imputed score was relatively high (124.1 and 121.2 for DRV/r qd and bid, respectively), leaving limited room for improvement. Mean (SE) increase in total FAHI score from baseline (ITT-LOCF) at Week 48 was comparable with DRV/r qd and bid dosing. A mean increase in total FAHI score from baseline was observed in both treatment groups at all timepoints. No relevant between-group differences were noted either by ANCOVA (p = 0.761) or longitudinal mixed model (p = 0.995). There were no relevant differences between arms at any time in the proportion of FAHI responders (p = 0.957). Conclusions: DRV/r qd and bid dosing was comparable with respect to the increase in mean total FAHI score from baseline at Week 48 and in the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful difference in total FAHI score at Week 48. Background: Patients with HIV RNA suppression below 50 copies/ mL may still have HIV RNA detectable by more sensitive PCR assay techniques. Methods: In the MONET trial, 256 patients with HIV RNA \\50 copies/mL on current HAART, and no history of virological failure, switched to DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily, either as monotherapy (n = 127) or with 2NRTI (n = 129). HIV RNA was evaluated by the Roche Amplicor Ultrasensitive assay (lower detection limit = 50 copies/mL), for all patient visits to Week 96. With this assay, ''Optical Density = background'' was used to assess whether HIV RNA was detectable or undetectable below 50 copies/ mL. Results: Patients were 81% male, 91% Caucasian, and had median baseline CD4 count of 575 cells/lL. At the baseline visit, the percentage of patients with HIV RNA undetectable below 50 copies/mL (OD = background) was 80% in the DRV/r mono arm and 79% in the DRV/r + 2NRTI arm. The percentage with HIV RNA at different levels at the Week 96 visit is show below (observed data analysis): HIV RNA 50-400 copies/mL 2.9 3.5", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3990, "end": 4006, "text": "1,896 (184-7,881", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4369, "end": 4410, "text": "(=79,576; 79,577-100,376; 100,377-119,356", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S62"}, {"text": "HIV RNA \\400 copies/mL 1.0 0.9 Including all samples from patient visits from Week 4 to Week 96, HIV RNA was above 50 copies/mL in 69/1,009 samples in the DRV/r monotherapy arm (50-400: 84%, 400-1,000: 12%, [1,000: 4%) and 47/1,051 samples in the DRV/r + 2NRTI arm (50-400: 83%, 400-1,000: 8.5%, [1,000: 8.5%) . Conclusions: In this study for patients with HIV RNA \\50 copies/ mL at baseline, switching to DRV/r monotherapy showed similar levels of HIV RNA suppression to DRV/r + 2NRTIs, using more sensitive PCR assay techniques. Background: Efavirenz (EFV) treatment has been associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Methods: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 157 treatmentna\u00efve patients with HIV RNA [5,000 copies/mL, were randomised 1:1 to either etravirine (ETR) 400 mg once daily (n = 79), or EFV 600 mg once daily (n = 78), plus two NRTIs. At screening, baseline, Week 2, 6, and 12, subjects completed the HIV-Patient Symptoms Profile (HPSP) questionnaire on the impact of adverse events associated with their treatment. The domains were classified as CNS (attention/memory, dizziness, mood, pain, sleep, tiredness) or non-CNS (adherence, body shape, breathing, digestion, sexual health, skin, temperature, vision). For each domain, the mean of worst reported scores per patient, during visits at Week 2, 6 and 12, was compared between arms. Results: Overall, the patients were 81% male, 85% Caucasian, with a median age 36 years. Baseline median CD4 Count was 302 cells/lL, median HIV RNA 4.8 log 10 copies/mL. In the primary analysis, 13/79 patients (16.5%) in the ETR arm, versus 36/78 (46.2%) in the EFV arm, showed at least one Grade 1-4 treatment-emergent drug-related NPS AE (p \\ 0.001). In the analysis of the HPSP questionnaire, the mean score of the etravirine arm was significantly better than the efavirenz arm for the domains of dizziness, vision and sleep (p \\ 0.05 for each comparison). For dizziness and sleep, the largest difference between arms was seen at Week 2, with smaller differences seen at Week 12. Differences in vision between the arms remained constant for Weeks 2-12. Patients with at least one neuropsychiatric adverse event had significantly worse scores in the CNS domains of the HPSP questionnaire (p \\ 0.001). Patients with a medical history of neuropsychiatric adverse events had significantly worse scores in the CNS domain (p \\ 0.001). Conclusions: In the double-blinded SENSE trial, three patientreported adverse events with randomized treatment-dizziness, vision and sleep-were significantly worse in the efavirenz arm, compared to the etravirine arm. UOC Diagnosi e Terapia AIDS della AOU della Seconda Universita`degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy; 2 AORN G.Moscati, Avellino, Italy Introduction: The prognostic improvement in HIV patients, induced by HAART, has emphasized the problem of optimization of the therapy management. The advent of new drugs has allowed to prove new HAART regimens that may represent a valid option either in proactive switches than in viro-immunological failures. AIM: Assessing if a HAART regimen NRTI-sparing, based on association of Raltegravir (RAL) and boosted PI (PI/r), may represent a good therapeutic option about efficacy, tolerability and adherence compared with Optimized Background Therapy (OBT) in switches for toxicity, simplification or failure. Methods: We have enrolled 64 consecutive patients, treated for HIV infection, observed from January to December 2009. Among these patients, 13 have switched (7 for failure, 5 for intolerance, 1 for simplification) to a HAART regimen, based on association of RAL + PI/r (Cases); 51 were in OBT with association of 2 NRTI + 1 PI/r (Controls). HIV/HCV coinfection was in 46% of Cases and 35% of Controls. Laboratory tests have been performed (CD4, HIV-RNA, Triglycerides, Cholesterol, ALT, AST, Creatinine, Haemogram) to assess efficacy and tolerability. Adherence has been assessed by counseling and SERAD questionnaire (Self-Reported Adherence). Results: Data of Cases have been compared to data pre-switch (PS) of the same group and to data of Controls. Mean CD4 count has been 649 in Cases, 542 in PS, 668 in Controls. About Cases, before switch, 10 patients had been treated with an association of 2 NRTI + 1 PI/r, 2 patients had been treated with 2 NRTI + 1 NNRTI, 1 patient was untreated. After switch, 31% of patients has suppressed its previous HIV viremia, 31% has reduced it, 23% has confirmed previous negativity, 15% has increased HIV-RNA. Hypertransaminasemia has been detected in 23% of Cases, 46% PS, 17% of Controls. High Triglycerides have been detected in 15% of Cases, 23% PS, 27% of Controls. High Cholesterol has been detected in 30% of Cases, 46% PS, 45% of Controls. Our preliminary results show preserved efficacy of treatment with RAL and PI/r, compared to Controls, with increase of CD4 mean in Cases after switch. In Cases, lipid values have been resulted lower than Controls and reduced if compared to PS. In Cases, Hypertransaminasemia has appeared reduced, relative to PS, but it has showed higher incidence, compared to Controls. In this last group, however, there were less HIV/HCV coinfected patients (35 vs. 46%). Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest that a HAART regimen, based on association of RAL and PI/r, may represent a valid therapeutic option in patients who need a switch for failure, toxicity or poor adherence. This therapy would result effective, well tolerated, with low pill burden, allowing moreover to save either NRTI class than NNRTI one. In this way, it will be possible to preserve future therapeutic options, preventing cross resistance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 309, "text": "[1,000: 8.5%)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S62"}, {"text": "Background: HAART has reduced AIDS-related mortality and morbidity, but it may contribute to the increased incidence of metabolic disorders in HIV-infected patients (pts). Both NRTI class and boosted ritonavir are major responsibles of such toxicities. Thus, alternative therapeutic strategies are warranted. The aim of our study is to evaluate the immuno-virological and metabolic outcome of HAART-experienced, HIV-infected pts switching to a NRTI and ritonavir-sparing regimen because of toxicity. Methods: HIV pts, switching because of toxicity to ATV 200 mg BID + RAL 200 mg BID, were enrolled in an observational, multicentre study. Inclusion criteria were: HIV-RNA\\50 cp/ml, no history of primary PI mutations, RAL na\u00efve and documented NRTI-or ritonavir-related toxicity. Pts with decompensated cirrhosis and/or on anti-acid therapy were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint was virological failure at T12 month (confirmed HIV-RNA [50 cp/ mL). As secondary endpoints immunological failure (defined as confirmed 20% decline in CD4+ T cell counts compared to baseline) and modification of metabolic parameters (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, glycemia) were evaluated. Data were collected at the time of RAL/ATV switch (T0) and after 3 (T3), 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) months. Results were expressed as median and Interquartile Range (IQR). The comparison between study time points were performed by Wilcoxon test. Results: 44 HIV pts were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (IQR 42-62), the majority of subjects were male (26, 59%), IVDU or MSM (17, 38.6% each), with long history of HIV disease (median 198 months, and with long duration of HAART (median 148.5 months, . Reasons for switch were: cardiovascular events (25%), dyslipidemia or diabetes (20%), renal or bone toxicity (20%), other (35%). In 25% of cases multiple toxicities were found. Before switching to ATV + RAL, 25 pts (57%) were on boosted-PI, 10 (23%) on unboosted ATV and 9 pts (20%) on NNRTI based HAART. 25 pts (57%) were on Tenofovir, 12 pts (27%) on Abacavir, 4 pts (9%) on AZT and 3 pts (7%) on other back-bone. T3 was reached by 31 pts, T6 by 28 pts and T12 by 18 pts. No viroimmunological failures were observed during the study period. All the 18 pts that reached the 12 month were still HIV-RNA \\50 cp/ml. Median increase of CD4 count were 4.5 (IQR -60.5, 107) at T6 and 17 (IQR -65.5, 239.5) at T12. Overall we noted a significant reduction of triglycerides, albeit normal at baseline (T0: 156 mg/dL, IQR 108-209; T3: 122 mg/dL, IQR 70-194, p = 0.002; T6: 111/mg/ dL, IQR 81-175, p = 0.017), and increase of HDL cholesterol at T3 (T0: 41 mg/dL, IQR 26-50; T3: 46 mg/dL, IQR 35-63; p = 0.022). Up to 39% (17/44) of pts showed hypertriglyceridemia at T0; in 65% (11/17) of pts triglyceride levels returned to normal range at T6. Conclusions: Although preliminary, our data suggest that RAL/ATV therapy may represent a valid option in the management of HIVpositive pts with metabolic disorders or other toxicities. Background: Despite the official guidelines suggest to keep always NRTIs as a component of HAART, evolving concepts in salvage often move the clinicians to limit rescue regimens to active drugs as reported by genotypic tests.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1618, "end": 1637, "text": "(median 198 months,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1691, "text": "(median 148.5 months,", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S62"}, {"text": "Objective: The aim of this analysis is to assess whether simpler rescue regimens are less effective on virus replication control and whether there are differences in toxicity using more or less complex associations. Methods: Patients from the MK0518 EAP were followed-up prospectively since enrolment in the study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected every 2-4 months after commercialization. The cohort has been divided for the current analysis in three subgroups: dual regimens (A), triple/quadruple regimens (B) and megaHAART ([4 drugs, C) . Statistical analysis has been performed using parametric and non-parametric tests. Results: Most of the cohort patients were on triple/quadruple regimens (186/253, 74%). Group A (n = 38), B (n = 186) and C (n = 29) were homogeneous by baseline HIV-RNA (p = 0.29), and GSS (p = 0.22), while baseline CD4 levels showed a significant trend towards higher CD4 counts in simpler regimens (means: A = 351; B = 281 and C = 164/mmc, p = 0.0009, Kruskall-Wallis test), reflecting a tendency in prescription. No statistically significant differences emerged in the rate of virologic failures or overall treatment discontinuations, and failure was not correlated with lower GSS scores, rather suggesting problems of adherence. Viral failure indeed was more frequent in more complex regimens (A = 5%, B = 11%, and C = 17%). All patients had impressive CD4 gains (A = +242; B = +232; C = +248, p = 0.52, paired t test). From a metabolic point of view, no difference was shown for ALT/AST levels, nor for triglycerides, while total cholesterol levels showed a trend to increase over time with more complex drug combinations. Patients on simpler regimens had significantly higher baseline cholesterol. Seven patients died in group B, four of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), one of acute myocardial infarction, one of end stage liver disease and one post-transplantation for HCV-related cirrhosis, one died in group C of hepatocellular carcinoma, and no one died in group A. Conclusions: Simpler regimens were neither associated in our analysis with a higher risk of viral failure nor to an impaired CD4+ T cell increase. The metabolic impact of simpler regimens was not related to an important gain in the toxicity profile, except for a slightly reduced increase in cholesterol levels. This analysis will be repeated at 96 weeks to assess long-term tolerability. Background: The toxic effects of new antiretroviral drugs on the central nervous system (CNS) are unclear. Because these drugs penetrate the brain even at low concentrations, it becomes crucial to determine the doses which can be toxic for the CNS resident cells. Moreover, after the recent introduction into clinical practice, it is unclear whether the efficacy of the antiretroviral drugs of new generation may also derive from their ability to exert extravirological effects on factors responsible for the development of HIV brain injury, e.g. matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Objective: To investigate on the toxicity of four different antiretroviral drugs and their ability to modulate the activity of MMPs in astrocyte cultures. Methods: Primary cultures of rat astrocytes were activated by exposure to 10 ?g/ml lipopolysaccaride (LPS) (positive control) and simultaneously treated for 20 h with increasing doses (1-5-10-25. 50 ?M) of: Efavirenz (EFV); Darunavir (DRV); Maraviroc (MVC) or Raltegravir (RAL). Culture supernatants were subjected to gelatin zymography for the assessment of MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels. Quantitative determination of MMP-9 and MMP-2 was done by computerized scanning densitometry. Single drug toxicity was assessed by the MTT test. Each drug was considered toxic at the concentration able to induce a percentage of cell survival above 60%. Results: The treatment with antiretroviral drugs inhibited MMP-9 levels in LPS-activated astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, while no statistically significant changes of MMP-2 levels were observed. In particular, a statistically significant inhibition of MMP-9 was observed when astrocytes were treated with 25?M EFV (60% of inhibition) or with 50 ?M RAL (40% of inhibition). As assessed by the MTT test, the toxicity of the antiretrovirals ranges from 10 and 50 ?M. In particular, EFV was toxic for astrocytes at the concentration of 25 ?M, MVC at 10 ?M, while DRV and RAL were toxic at the concentration of 50?M. Conclusions: The present results indicate that EFV and RAL directly inhibit MMP-9 levels in LPS-activated astrocytes with mechanisms that are independent from their antiviral activity. The toxic doses of antiretrovirals are much higher than those found in the CSF of HIVpositive patients. Our results highlight some beneficial/deleterious extra-viral effects of the antiretroviral drugs that may be useful to improve the development of new therapeutic strategies for the management of HIV infection. Background: The impact on renal toxicity of switching from tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) to abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) is still unclear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 550, "text": "([4 drugs, C)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3319, "end": 3333, "text": "(1-5-10-25. 50", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S62"}, {"text": "Methods: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted on HIV+ patients (pts) who stopped TDF and started ABC for renal adverse events.

Background: Cigarette smoke is the most preventable cause of death and chronic disease (atherosclerosis and cancer) in most countries and recent epidemiologic studies suggest that cigarette smoke promotes the progression of kidney disease. Smoking may cause renal injury through several hemodynamic actions and also non-hemodynamic actions of nicotine, such as damage to endothelial cells, interference with the coagulation/fibrinolysis systems, generation of oxygen radicals. Aim of this study was to evaluate Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) changes in relationship with smoking in an Italian cohort receiving a tenofovir (TDF)-containing HAART. Methods: OSMA-1 (Observational Study on Metabolic Abnormalities), a multicenter Italian study, was designed to evaluate since February 2008 the efficacy and the safety of TDF-based regimen in a real-life clinical setting. HIV infected, therapy na\u00efve subjects were enrolled. GFR was estimated using Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. Statistical analyses used a parametric test and a mixed model was used to analysis changes from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 months, with the different variables as fixed effect plus visit (categorical) and baseline value (continuous as covariate). Results: We consecutively enrolled 172 patients (91.3% Caucasian; 72.2% males; mean age 39.3 years; 48.8% heterosexual; 36.6% smokers). At baseline median CD4+ cell count was 225 cells/lL (range 2-701), HIVRNA [100,000 copies/mL in 43.6%. Median body mass index (BMI) was 22.6 for males and 21.9 for females. A boosted PI was given in 60.5% of cases. At 6-months evaluation, women (W) had greater declines in GFR versus men (M), independently from the GFR equation used (means in W vs. M for CG, MDRD and CK-EPI, respectively: -7.2; -12.1; -10 vs. 0.5; -1.3; -0.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , p = 0.0001-0.0026). No further decline was documented after 6 months. However, in multivariate analyses smoking is associated with a renal function worsening (CG, MDRD and CK-EPI: p = 0.073, p = 0.012 and p = 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Smoking, beyond female gender, is an important renal risk factor in patients treated with a combination therapy containing TDF. Clinicians should prioritize any efforts to encourage their patients quit smoking as the most cost-effective and beneficial strategy to spare also a possible renal toxicity associated with TDF. Background: As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor because of concern about potential increases among HIV-infected patients in liver toxicity and vascular risk attributable to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, fat redistribution, and hypertension, we hypothesized that fos-amprenavir would be associated with few metabolic and hepatic side effects. Methods: We set up an observational single arm retrospective study on a cohort of 137 HIV infected patients, followed up at A.O.R.N. Cotugno Hospital, Naples, Italy, attending the third and the fourth division of infectious diseases, in treatment with an antiretroviral regimen including Fosamprenavir. Primary endpoint: Proportion of subjects experiencing at least one of the following condition during the follow-up: grade = 3 in ALT, grade = 3 in total cholesterol, grade = 3 in triglycerides, grade = 3 in serum glucose level, treatment discontinued for AEs. Secondary endpoints: ? Proportion of subjects experiencing at least one of the above mentioned conditions at the end of the follow up. ? proportion of subjects requiring cotherapy discontinuation. ? proportion of subjects with VL \\50 cp/ml after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment Results: The follow up period was up to 48 weeks in most patients (114 patients; 83.21%) with a minimum of 24 weeks in the remaining cases. Only seven patients met the criteria to reach the primary endpoint and no one of them discontinued HAART therapy during the follow up period, without any statistically significant differences between na\u00efve and experienced and according to age ([50 years old) and backbone. Seventy-six percent of patients presented HIV RNA \\50 cp/lL after 24 weeks of therapy and 80% reached viral load \\50 cp/lL at 48 weeks of observation. The mean increase of CD4+ cell was about 200 cells/lL. Looking at secondary endpoints at the end of follow up, we failed to find any patients with fasting cholesterolemia above grade 3, while 2 out of 114 (1.75%) cases presented AST and or ALT [ grade 3, one patient out of 112 (0.89%) had fasting triglyceridemia [ grade 3 and 1 out of 114 cases had fasting glycaemia [ grade 3. One patient developed a malignant neoplasm (0.7%) and 4 (3%) displayed a newly diagnosed hypertension. All therapies administrated for this last comorbidities were well tolerated and did not need any changes or discontinuation related to HAART therapy. Conclusions: Our retrospective study showed that fosamprenavir based regimens had a reduced number of serious metabolic adverse events during a 1 year follow up period, with a low incidence of comorbidities and satisfying results in term of viro-immuological response also in patients with already existing co-morbidities requiring other therapies. Background: Atazanavir (ATV) based regimens are generally well tolerated and seem to have a better metabolic profile than other PIs and NNRTIs based treatment. Few study assessed safety and effectiveness of ATV/r regimens for more than 2 years. Aim of this study is to describe efficacy and safety of ATV/r based regimens in a cohort of experienced patients treated for a long period of time. Methods: Patients switched to ATV300/r based regimen after at least 6 months of any other HAART therapy were enrolled in a retrospective study. We evaluated the proportion of patients maintaining HIV RNA \\50 copies/ml, median increase of CD4 cell count, total cholesterol and triglycerides, liver transaminases, total bilirubin at the time of starting the ATV/r therapeutic regimen and after 1-4-8-12-24-36-48-60 months respectively. More frequent side effects and causes for discontinuation were also described. Results: A total of 107 patients were evaluated; 62 (57.9%) were male, median age 45 (IQR 40-54) years, 55% heterosexuals, 24% MSMs, 21% IVDUs. 32% were HBV and/or HCV coinfected. Median time from HIV diagnosis was 11 years (IQR 5-15). Median length of HAART was 8 (IQR 4-11) years; median number of line of treatment was 4 (IQR 2-5). Before switching to ATV/r, 46% were on PI/r based treatment, 30% on NNRTI, 15% on PI unboosted and 9% on triple NRTI. At baseline median CD4 cell count was 341 (IQR 237-537) cells/ll, median HIV RNA viremia log 2.45 \u00b1 1.47 copies/ml; 58% had HIV RNA \\50 copies/ml. Median total cholesterol (TC) was 205 (IQR 171-269) mg/dl, 55% with more than normal value, median triglycerides 174 (IQR 116-315) mg/dl, 59% with more than normal value. After 12, 24, 36 months of treatment median CD4 cell count was 449 (IQR 300-615), 482 (IQR 354-700), 493 (IQR 368-773) cells/ll respectively. At the same times 83, 86, 79% of patients on treatment had HIV RNA \\50 copies/ml. After 12 months 57% had altered TC value, 51% altered triglycerides. Patients with elevated bilirubinemia ([1.5 mg/dl) were 83, 84, 73% after 4, 8 and 12 months of treatment. After a median time of follow up of 40.6 months (IQR 24.3-59.8) 17% stopped the treatment. The most frequent causes for discontinuation were virological failure (8.5%) patient's choice (5.7%) toxicity (2.8%). Conclusions: In a clinical real life setting ARV regimens based on ATV/r showed sustained virological response also after 36 months of treatment in an high proportion of patients. Treatment was generally well tolerated and safe although just few patients achieved a significant reduction of lipids levels. Hyper-bilirubinemia was frequent but never caused discontinuation. Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine in an Italian cohort the incidence of treatment switches and their causes to modify the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Treatment modification can be either proactive (prevention) when the goal is to avoid an adverse event or drug interaction or to maximize the potential for optimal adherence and reactive (complication) when the modification is made after the occurrence of an adverse event or drug interaction. Methods: We included in the study the outpatient population on antiretroviral therapy of the 1 Division of Infectious Diseases in a 3 years (2008-2010) follow up period. The endpoints were substitution or discontinuation of at least one HAART component of the regimen for any reason (poor adherence, simplification and intolerance/toxicity). Switches were done with a new drug only in patients without resistant virus. When a patient discontinued a drug in the antiretroviral regimen, regardless of whether or not he switched to another regimen, clinicians were asked to report the reason for interruption (only one reason for each stopped drug). Descriptive analysis was performed. Results: A total of 897 patients were included in the study: 28.5% were female, 44% were HCV coinfected; their median age was 45 years. The proportion of patients achieving undetectable HIV-1 RNA was near 90%. The main causes of switching (see Table) were the simplification/adherence (181) and metabolic complications (48) in a 3 years follow up period. In 257 patients (70%) the NRTIbackbone was changed, in general, within-class substitutions using a newer agent and coformulated drugs or to prevent/interrupt toxicity. Switches with PIs or NNRTI (110; 30%) were done to reduce dosing frequency, pill count, drug-drug interactions, or for metabolic and gastrointestinal/hepatic complications. Conclusions: It seems important to evaluate reason-specific trends in the incidence of discontinuation in order to better understand the determinants of changes over time. The incidence of discontinuation for intolerance/toxicity is not declined over time while simplification strategies have become more frequent in recent years. Background: In patients with HIV infection, both na\u00efve and experienced, Raltegravir (RAL) was an effective drug and generally well tolerated in antiretroviral combination therapy. This drug is certainly interesting to be taken into account in patients requiring cholesterollowering therapy or shift in those who are familiar or genetic predisposition to dyslipidemia. We have considered HIV seropositive patients receiving raltegravir as part of a combination regimen of second line or after multifailure, in particular we have evaluated the metabolic abnormalities. Materials and methods: As a simplified metabolic profile were considered blood glucose, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides in 44 patients referred to our center who started combination therapy with raltegravir. The determination was evaluated at 48 weeks of RAL therapy. Of these patients 11 were females and 33 males. The mean age of patients was equal to 51 years (range 25-69 years) with as many as 37 patients (84%) aged [45 years. The quantitative viral load was \\15 copies/mL in 32 patients (73%), in 9 (21%) was \\50 copies/mL while in only 3 patients the viral load was not completely suppressed. The immunological balance of these patients was on average equal to 509 CD4/mmc (range 125-1,396).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 9585, "end": 9590, "text": "(181)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 9544, "end": 9550, "text": "Table)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "S62"}, {"text": "Results: The metabolic profile of patients are summarized below.

Methods: Observational, prospective, cohort study including 30 HIV vertically-infected adolescents and youths aging 14-25 years. Patients chronically treated (mean duration: 64 months) with lamivudine, tenofovir (TDF) and efavirenz (EFV) and with stable HIV-RNA \\50 cp/ml were switched to a single-tablet regimen (STR) of emtricitabine + TDF + EFV. Data were collected with an anonymous 36-items questionnaire on self-reported adherence, quality of life and symptoms and with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-d 10).

At baseline, the majority (86.7%) of patients was asymptomatic; CDC classifications were N + A in 43.3% and B + C in 56.7% of cases. During the entire study period, all cases maintained HIV-RNA \\50 copies/ml and low mean rate of symptoms score (range 0-100) between 9.8 and 6.8. CD4 T-cell % showed a significant (p \\ 0,05) increase from 35.2 (SD 8.9) to 39.4 (SD 14.1) between t0 and t1 and this improvement persisted at t12 (41.1, SD 14.3). Adherence, high above 80% at t0, remained stably optimal along the entire study period. Satisfaction with therapy score (range 0-10), high at baseline (8.2, SD 1.9), showed a persistent increase reaching significance (p = 0.02) at t12 (9.0, SD 1.4). Selfperceived physical fatigue declined from 3.6 (3.1) to 3.2 (2.9) at t1; a further slight decrease to 2.1 (2.2) was observed at t12.

Background: Pregnancy could cause a significant reduction of plasmatic drug concentration of some protease inhibitors (PI). Furthermore, the protease inhibitors transplacental passage and compartmental diffusion are generally very low. Although, there is positive experience of darunavir (DRV) prescription during pregnancy, data concerning DRV pharmacokinetics and placental transfer are scant and secondary compartments concentrations are unknown. We report pharmacokinetics and compartmental distribution of once daily administrated DRV boosted with low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r), in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF). In one experienced patient only, DRV was administrated twice daily and was associated to FTC/TDF and raltegravir (RAL). Methods: HIV positive pregnant women on DRV/r as part of their routine maternity care were enrolled for the study. DRV plasma trough concentrations (Ctrough) were determined in the first (T1) and/or second (T2) and/or third trimester (T3) and at delivery (D) using a validated HPLC-UV methodology with a limit quantification of 78 ng/ml. Cord blood and amniotic fluid concentrations were also measured at delivery. 12 h pharmacokinetic (PK) curves were performed between 33 and 37 weeks of gestation and in postpartum (PP) in one woman with twice daily administration. Newborn data including gestational age, weight, Apgar score, HIV infection status and any kind of maternal and/or newborn complication were collected at birth. Results: Five Caucasian women with mean age of 34 \u00b1 2 years and mean BMI of 31 \u00b1 10 kg/m 2 , were recruited. All woman were virally suppressed (HIV RNA \\40 cpm) throughout pregnancy and had CD4 cell counts [300 cells/mm 3 (mean 674 \u00b1 268 cells/mm 3 ). Mean DRV concentrations in T1 was 2,800 ng/ml, in T2 (mean time after dosing 11 \u00b1 0.8 h) was 1,769 \u00b1 153 ng/ml, in T3 (mean time after dosing 11 \u00b1 0.4 h) was 1,764 \u00b1 641 ng/ml and at delivery (mean time after dosing 7.25 \u00b1 3.5 h) was 2,014 \u00b1 1,549 ng/ml. PK curve of twice daily administrated DRV/r performed at 35 weeks of gestation evidenced lower concentrations (30%) in comparison to PP (C peak 7,610 ng/ml). Cord blood and amniotic fluid concentrations were 221 \u00b1 148 ng/ml and 466 \u00b1 374 ng/ml, respectively.

Background: Efavirenz (EFV) treatment is associated with a range of neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events (AEs), which differ in duration and severity. Methods: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 157 treatmentna\u00efve patients with HIV RNA [5,000 copies/mL, were randomised 1:1 to either etravirine (ETR) 400 mg once daily (n = 79), or EFV 600 mg once daily (n = 78), plus two NRTIs. After 12 weeks of randomised treatment, the type and frequency of NPS AEs was compared between treatment arms. Results: Overall, the patients were 81% male, 85% Caucasian, with a median age of 36 years. Median baseline CD4 Count was 302 cells/ lL, median HIV RNA 4.8 log 10 copies/mL. In the primary analysis, 13/79 patients (16.5%) in the ETR arm, versus 36/78 (46.2%) in the EFV arm, showed at least one Grade 1-4 treatment-emergent drugrelated NPS AE (p \\ 0.001). The most common neurological AE was dizziness, reported for 3 patients in the ETR arm versus 15 in the EFV arm. The most common psychiatric adverse events were sleep disorders, reported in 7 patients in the ETR arm versus 25 patients in the EFV arm. The prevalence of Grade 1-4 all cause NPS AEs showed a peak at Week 2 (21.5% in the ETR arm and 43.6% in the EFV arm), but at the Week 12 visit, the percentage with an ongoing Grade 1-4 all cause NPS AE remained different between the arms (21.7% with ETR and 35.7% with EFV). In the ETR arm, 29 all cause NPS adverse events were reported: 20 Grade 1, 7 Grade 2 and 2 Grade 3. In the EFV arm, 93 NPS adverse events were reported: 55 Grade 1, 34 Grade 2 and four Grade 3. New medication for NPS adverse events was started for 7.6% of patients in the ETR arm versus 16.7% of patients in the EFV arm. One patient in the ETR arm and five in the EFV arm discontinued randomized treatment with NPS AE's. Conclusions: In the SENSE trial, first-line treatment with ETR 400 mg once daily + 2NRTIs led to significantly fewer NPS AEs, compared with EFV + 2NRTIs. These NPS AEs were mainly Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The difference between the arms emerged at Week 2, but persisted through Week 12.

The incidence of the dry-eye syndrome (DES) under HAART remains unchanged compared to the incidence in the pre-HAART era. DES, likely caused either by HIV itself and HAART, is a tear film alteration involving both lipid and mucous lacrimal layers. Usually DES is treated with tear drops (ipromellosa or ialuronic acid) to avoid further corneal alterations. A new compound, lipoic acid, featured with antioxidant, epitheliotropic and neurotropic characteristics was evaluated in a eye drop association with ipromellosa in HIV-positive patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "Methods: This study (prospective, randomized, controlled, single blinded) assessed the effect of ipromellosa plus lipoic acid (group A) versus ipromellosa only (group B) eye drops on DES in HIV-positive patients. Patients were enrolled if complaining any eye drynessassociated symptom (burning, itching, foreign body sensation, photophobia) and hyperaemia. We excluded patients with infectious kerato-conjunctivitis, ocular inflammation, erosions and corneal ulcers, severe systemic comorbidities or previous surgery in anterior or posterior segment in the last 6 months. One drop of the randomized preparation was given in each eye three times a day for 3 months. The evaluation consisted in: physical examination, biomicroscopic exam, visual acuity, Schirmer test and tear break-up time test (BUT) measured in both eyes. Questionnaire about dry-eye symptoms and quantitative tests have been performed in baseline visit, then at 15, 30 and 90 days. Results: Eighteen patients (36 eyes) were randomized but only 32 eyes were analyzed. The demographic characteristics were similar in two groups. Mean age was 43 years (range 28-56), males were 11. All patients were on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIVRNA was undetectable and median CD4 cell counts was 421 cells/ll (range 133-720). BUT improved significantly in group A versus B (at baseline: 5 s \u00b1 2 and 6.17 s \u00b1 1.60; after 90 days: 10.2 s \u00b1 1.48 and 7 s \u00b1 1.9, respectively, p = 0.01). Photophobia and hyperaemia also improved in a significant way (p = 0.03 for both parameters) in the group A versus B at the 3-month evaluation. A significant trend favouring group A was noted for other symptoms. The immune status as measured by CD4+ cell count and percentage did not changed during the observational period. Discussion: Patients treated with lipoic acid-containing eye drops showed a significant improvement in their inflammatory process when compared to a control treatment. This may be due to a quick stabilization of lacrimal film (already present at 15 days), irrespective of immune-virological status. Although the number of patients was limited, our results confirmed the epithelio-neuroprotective activity and epithelio-neurotropic, anti-oxidant functions of lipoic acid. Background: Increasing evidences suggest that HIV-1+ subjects have a significant raise in cardiovascular risk [1] [2] [3] . A key role is played by HIV-1, immune activation and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism associated with antiretrovirals are described [4] [5] [6] . The DAD Study showed a significant increase of myocardial infarction risk in patients on ABC, characterized by a rapid occurrence and not linked to the treatment length [7] .

Background: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a first-choice nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) according to the major guidelines. We evaluated its safety and efficacy in the long term in a real-life setting. Methods: Observational, single center study. Patients starting TDF were included in the analysis if they had at least a follow-up visit. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the clinical records. Follow-up was censored at the discontinuation of TDF, death or loss to follow-up or at the last visit in our Outpatient service. Changes in backbones did not influence the duration of TDF-containing regimens. Time and predictors of discontinuation of TDF was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox's analyses. After preliminary univariable screening of [110 variables, a final multivariable model (40 variables) was produced. Results: 1,492 patients (19.1% na\u00efve, 20,1% second line and 60.7% later lines of therapy) starting TDF from 2002 to 2010 were included in the analysis for a median duration of the TDF-containing therapy of 21.3 weeks (IQR 9.3-37.6) and a 4,812.9 person-year follow-up (PYFU). 414 discontinuation events occurred (incidence: 8.6 per 100 PYFU); the probability to continue the TDF-based therapy was 0.898 (0.882-0.914) for the first year, 0.833 (0.813-0.853) at 2 years and 0.652 (0.622-0.683) at 5 years. 9.1% of patients discontinued TDF for virological failure (VF), 40% for toxicity, 13.6% for inadequate adherence, 18.3% for simplification, 7.9% for other reasons and in 11% of cases the reason was unknown. TDF was discontinued in 16/89 (18%) na\u00efve patients, 38/203 (16.1%) experienced patients with baseline VL \\50 c/mL and 284/936 (30.3%) experienced patients with baseline VL [50 c/mL. Among experienced patients with baseline VL \\50 c/mL the VF rate was 5.3% (2 events) and the toxicity rate was 42.1% (16 events) whereas among experienced patients with baseline VL [50 c/mL the VF were 9.7% (28 events) and the toxicity rate was 37.7% (109 events). More recent calendar year in which TDF was started, higher baseline creatinine and concomitant use of DDI independently predicted the interruption of the TDF-containing regimen at multivariate analysis in the whole population whereas higher CD4 cell count at last follow-up and ritonavirboosted protease inhibitors or entry/integrase inhibitors at treatment interruption negatively predicted the outcome. Median creatinine at last follow-up visit was 1 mg/dL (IQR); 210/1,375 (15.3%) had a creatinine higher than 1.3 mg/dL at treatment interruption. Conclusions: In our Clinic's real-life practice, TDF was safe, efficacious and well tolerated. Discontinuations as well as high creatinine levels leading to treatment discontinuation were infrequent. Background: To assess the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline and to identify predictors for osteopenia/osteoporosis in a prospective monocentric cohort of north-Italian HIV+ patients. Methods: The cohort included only subjects who were naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART) or receiving their first ART. Subjects underwent a standardized baseline assessment to evaluate demographic and anthropometric characteristics, clinical history, biochemical parameters (including CD4 count and HIV viral load), ART regimen (if any). Lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip BMD measurements were obtained by DXA. T scores and Z scores were recalculated using the appropriate NHANES reference values. Low BMD was defined by a T score\\-1 in at least one of the three sites considered. To evaluate predictors of low BMD bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. First, it was assessed the bivariate association between low BMD and variables collected at baseline. Then, all co-variates associated with low BMD with a p \\ 0.1 were retained and included in a logistic regression analysis. Results: The prospective cohort included 112 HIV+ subjects (males = 68, females = 44), aged 25-69 years were enrolled in the study. Overall 12% of patients presented osteoporosis (T-score \\-2.5) and 35% presented osteopenia (T-score \\ -1 [ -2.5). Univariate analysis showed the following significant associations with low BMD: older age (p = 0.003); current smoking (p = 0.024), reduced creatinine clearance (p = 0.019); increased interleukin-6 (p = 0.047). Low calcium intake (p = 0.08) and current use of protease inhibitors (p = 0.059) were associated with low BMD at the limit of significativity. Interestingly, in a multivariate model, only reduced creatinine clearance (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07-6.08, p = 0.034) and current smoking (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.24-7.44, p = 0.015) still resulted significantly associated to low BMD. Conclusions: In our population the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was similar to those previously reported. Interestingly, nor ART, neither tenofovir use were associated with low BMD. Actually, the only identified predictors of low BMD at baseline (reduced renal function and current smoking) are well acknowledged as typical risk factors for osteoporosis and/or bone diseases. Prospective data will help in verifying their importance in the next stages of HIV infection or in the next phases of ART in this cohort. in the general population. The studies about the lack of vitamin D in the course of HIV infection are few. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between vit D and CVR in HIV+ patients. Materials and methods: We enrolled a total of 100 HIV+ patients, who were divided according to the RVC calculated by the Framingham Risk Score. We analyzed the following parameters: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic (DBP), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (ColTot), HDL, LDL, glucose, HOMA index, BMI, CRP, ESR, microalbuminuria, cystatin C, Na, K, Ca, Vit D. Results: 20 patients (mean age 52 \u00b1 11 years) with high CVR ([ 10%) showed statistically lower levels of serum vitamin D compared to 90 patients with low CVR (=10%) (13 \u00b1 11 versus 20 \u00b1 12 mg/dl, P \\ 0.01). Patients with high CVR showed statistically higher levels of SBP, TG, ColTot and blood glucose and lower HDL levels than patients with low CVR. In addition, multiple regression analysis showed that each decrease of 10 mg/dl of vitamin D has a 85% increase in CVR (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.76, P \\ 0.04), irrespective of disease duration and the number of CD4 cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "Conclusions: It is known that levels of vitamin D in the general population are inversely correlated with coronary artery disease, associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "Recently it was shown that vitamin D has effects on endothelial function and reduces vascular calcification. In addition, the calcification of the coronary arteries is inversely correlated with levels of vitamin D. The potential mechanisms underlying this association appears to be various, due to either an increased arterial calcification, impaired endothelial function, or a direct effect on cardiac contractility that dysregulates inflammatory cytokines. Our study shows that in HIV+ patients the vit D deficiency is associated with an increased CVR. This deficit depends on the duration of the infection, but not on the presence of the HIV virus itself. Objective: to evaluate the long-term safety of a dual regimen of raltegravir (RAL) and ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in ARV experienced patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Methods: prospective, single centre, study in patients on treatment with 2NRTI + PI/r who switched to RAL and PI/r because of CKD. Demographic, epidemiological, laboratory, viro-immunological data were collected using medical report database. Patients were required to have undetectable viral load at baseline and during the previous 12 months. CKD was defined on the basis of National Kidney Foundation Guidelines (2002) . Results: 8 patients were included: 7/1 male, median age 50 years. At baseline all patients had HIV RNA \\40 copies/ml and median CD4 540 cells/mmc. 4/8 were receiving TDF/FTC as backbone and 4/8 ABC/3TC; 3/8 showed severe CKD (stage 4), and 5/8 moderate CKD (stage 3). Patients switched from 2NRTI to RAL maintaining the same PI/r (5 LPV/r, 2 DRV/r, 1 ATZ/r). After a median follow-up of 19 months all patients were on treatment. At the latest visit, median CD4 was 661/mmc, HIV RNA was below 40 copies/ml in all patients. 4/8 patients had a mild CKD (Stage 2), 3/8 moderate CKD (stage 3) and 1/8 maintained severe CKD (stage 4). No other clinical or laboratory adverse events were observed. Conclusion: Our data suggest that dual regimen of RAL and PI/r could be an attractive and safe options in patients with chronic kidney disease. Limitation of this study is the low number of patients included. Further randomized clinical trials are needed in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of this strategy. 1-11 ). The median CD4 T cell count was 424/mmc (IQR 242-646) and 45.6% of patients had an undetectable plasma viremia. 52.7% of patients were cigarette smokers, and 6.4% were active DAs (58.5% of them were cocaine users). 6.9% of patients had arterial hypertension, 3.4% had diabetes mellitus, 26.5% had hypertriglyceridaemia, 16% had hypercolesterolaemia. The FRS was \\10% in 76% of patients and [20% in 6.7%. 66% of patients were on ARV therapy. Forty-one patients (4%) had a previous CV diseases and 12 (1.2%) patients had had a previous CV event (10 IMA and 2 ictus cerebri). All 12 patients (males 10) had a history of cigarette smoking, were older than patients without previous CV events (44 vs. 41 years, respectively; p = 0.023), and had a longer duration of HIV disease (9 vs. 5 years, respectively; p = 0.017). The median follow-up period was 4 years. Over 2,630 person-years, 7 patients experienced a CV event (6 IMA and 1 ictus cerebri) with an incidence rate of 2.6/1,000 person-year (95% CI 1.16-5.27). All incident patients were males, with a median age of 52 years (IQR 39-59). Only sex and age were found to be significantly associated with CV events. Conclusions: CV events in HIV-infected patients represent an increasing concern in HIV infection management. Sex, ageing and duration of HIV disease seem to be important risk factors for the development of CV events. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of HIV disease in the pathogenesis of the CV involvement. Background: Metabolic abnormalities associated with cumulative exposure to cART, have been linked to an increased of cardiovascular risk (CVR) in HIV+ individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the switch to DRV/r from LPV/r or FPV/r in HIV+ patients with HIV-RNA \\400 copies/ml and metabolic abnormalities improves their lipid and glucidic profile. Methods: Ten Caucasian HIV+ patients in cART included LPV/r or FPV/r for C12 months, with high plasmatic levels of total cholesterol (TCh) and triglycerides (TGs) and HIV-RNA \\400 copies/ml for at least 6 months, were switched to receive DRV/r, without a change in their backbone. Parameters were measured at baseline (T0), after 3 (T3) and 6 months (T6). Results: After switching, patients showed an improvement of metabolic abnormalities with 18% reduction of TCh, 15% for LDL-C, and 52% decrease in TGs levels whereas HOMA-IR showed a trend to decrease. Cystatin C serum levels statistically decreased. Indexes of hepatic and renal functionality did not change.CD4 cell count increased with statistical significance while HIV-RNA did not change throughout the study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1256, "end": 1273, "text": "Guidelines (2002)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2284, "end": 2288, "text": "1-11", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "Conclusions: The switch to DRV/r showed an improvement of metabolic abnormalities and a possible beneficial effect on some factors of CVR. This may also be confirmed by the significant decrease of 11% in cystatin C, an important predictor of CVR. Furthermore, DRV/r also induced a good immunological response (39%) were HIV negative (group B). No differences in sex, age and race between groups were found. Patients in group A were more frequently co-infected with hepatitis B or C than patients in group B (40 vs. 7%, respectively; p = 0.008). All patients received standard treatment with liposomial amphotericine B. Relapses occurred in the 27% of patients. The incidence of relapse was significantly higher in group A than B (78 vs. 22%, respectively; p = 0.009). Other factors associated to relapse risk were: co-infection with hepatitis B or C (p = 0.014) and age at the first diagnosis (p = 0.035). The statistical significance was confirmed at uni-and multivariate analysis. The prophylactic therapy with miltefosine or liposomial amphotericine was administered in 3 of 20 patients in group A; no patients in group B received prophylaxis. No statistical correlation between use of chemoprophylaxis and relapse was found. Discussion: Patients with HIV infection had a higher risk of relapse than without HIV. The HBV or HCV co-infection and the older age at the first diagnosis resulted independently associated to risk of relapse. Several analyses are necessary to better evaluate the role of chemoprophylaxis in order to reduce the relapse in HIV patients. Background: Abscess formation is one of the possible manifestations of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Tubercular abscesses may appear anywhere in the body, but are most commonly found in the spines, hips, lymph nodes or in the genital area. On the contrary, gluteal localization, without bone involvement, is an atypical and rare presentation in the general population, that was never reported in people living with HIV/AIDS. Patients and methods: We molecularly characterized the Mycobacterium tubercolosis strains isolated from gluteus abscesses of five transgender HIV-positive patients who received years or months earlier multiple silicone fluid injections in the buttocks for cosmetic purpose, and compared the strains with previous pulmonary isolates using Spolygotyping and MIRU-VNTRR 12 loci. Results: In the last year, diffuse swelling of the buttocks with overlying skin lesions associated with seropurulent discharge was observed in five HIV-infected patients, all on antiretroviral (ARV) treatment with CD4 count higher than 300 cells/ll and undetectable HIV-RNA. Unexpectedly, M. tuberculosis was isolated from all the patients. All the patients had been treated for pulmonary TB years earlier. At time of abscess presentation chest radiography and sputum culture for M. tuberculosis were negative in all but one patients and no bone involvement was detected. The patients received rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for further 4 months. Since previous pulmonary strains were available, genotypical identity between the abscess strain and the previous pulmonary isolate was demonstrated with molecular biology techniques. Conclusions: The cases described are extremely unusual because the patients suffered from pulmonary TB more than 5 years before presenting abscess formation. In our opinion, muscle TB develops as the result of haematogenous or lymphatic spread of M.tuberculosis from a still active pulmonary focus in one case or from healed foci in the other four. It is possible that the decreased immunity associated to HIV infection might have possibly flared up an underlying TB infection, even if we cannot exclude that silicon oil promotes the growth of M.tuberculosis. In conclusion we should consider the possibility of TB in any transgender patient who underwent silicone fluid injections in the buttocks presenting gluteus abscesses. Introduction: Described for the first time by Paracelsus in 1585, syphilitic hepatitis has been classically depicted as disproportionately elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level in the setting of a secondary syphilis with rash. In the last 30 years it has been poorly studied, especially in HIV-infected subjects: to date, only ten series of acute hepatitis among HIV patients have been reported and risk factors associated with this condition have not been fully investigated. Nevertheless, given the recent syphilis upsurge, in particular among men who have sex with men, it deserves new interest. Aim of our study is to analyze incidence of syphilitic hepatitis in an HIV-infected cohort evaluating possible risk factors associated with elevated hepatic values. Methods: All patients attending our Outpatient HIV Clinic from January, 01 2009 to December, 31 2010 were tested for T. pallidum antibodies; those who tested positive, were further analyzed with RPR and TPPA. Subjects with positive RPR but with negative serology for HBV and HCV were included in this analysis. Incidence and risk factors were assessed with descriptive and regression statistical approaches.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "Results: During the 24 months study period, 605 patients were tested and 35 resulted RPR-positive (incidence 5.8%); 9 subjects were excluded because of a HBV/HCV co-infection. Among the 26 included (Table 1) , 4 had abnormal ALT values ([2ULN): hepatitis incidence was 11.4% among all syphilis cases, 0.7% in the whole cohort. Figure 1 shows cases of elevated ALT values in our Outpatient Clinic: syphilis represents a minor cause of hypertransaminasemia (2.9%). Syphilis is even a minor cause of elevated ALP levels (1.9%). Syphilitic hepatitis heals within 3-6 months after a proper antibiotic treatment (Fig. 2) . Risk factors associated with elevated ALT and ALP values are shown in Table 2 . Discussion: Syphilitic hepatitis is an uncommon condition; in our Clinic, ALP values seldom increased to clinically significant values. Given the small number of cases, the statistical analyses lack of adequate power; symptomatic (secondary or tertiary) syphilis infection is the only risk factor associated with raised ALT values. Although uncommon, syphilis should be taken into account when evaluating unexpected high transaminases levels; further studies with larger samples are needed to recognize more effectively risk factors associated with this hepatic involvement. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, normal range 0-40 U/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT, normal range 0-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase (ALP, normal range 40-128 U/L); total bilirubin (normal range 0-1.1 U/L) Breast cancer is of particular importance among non-AIDS defining cancers (NADCs), because of its incidence in industrialized and developing countries. Here we studied the effects of a known human carcinogen, the highly persistent heavy metal cadmium, on cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and on two of the main intracellular targets of HIV, heat shock protein 90 (hsp90, targeted by Tat protein, known to be imported into the nucleus of human breast cancer cells), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, involved in DNA repair and oxidative stress associated with HIV infection). The effects of nontoxic doses of cadmium (1-10 lM) on intracellular HIV targets were studied in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and in their normal counterpart (MCF-10A). The effects of Gc-Macrophage Activating Factor (GcMAF), a protein demonstrated to be effective in HIV and breast cancer treatment (J Med Virol 81:16-26, 2009 . Int J Cancer 122: 461-7, 2008 were also studied in MCF-7 cells. Cell proliferation was studied by 5-bromo-deoxiuridine labelling and by MTTbased assay. Hsp90b expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. PARP expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Angiogenesis was studied in chick embryo chorionallantoic membrane (CAM). Proliferation of normal and transformed cells in serum-starved medium was inhibited by cadmium in dose-dependent manner. GcMAF (1 ng/ml) significantly inhibited MCF-7proliferation. The effect of cadmium was partially reversed by zinc. Hsp90b and PARP expression levels were increased by cadmium in dose-dependent manner in both types of cells, thus mimicking the effects of HIV on those intracellular targets. The effects of cadmium on angiogenesis were opposite in the two cell lines; MCF-7-induced angiogenesis in CAM was inhibited, whereas MCF-10-induced angiogenesis was stimulated. GcMAF (1 ng/ml) significantly inhibited MCF-7-induced angiogenesis. These results indicate that cadmium and HIV recognize as intracellular molecular targets two of the principal regulators of cell responses to stress, i.e. hsp90 and PARP. In human breast cancer cells, increased expression of hsp90 and PARP was associated with reduced cell proliferation and inhibition of angiogenesis. Since cadmium and GcMAF exerted similar effects on MCF-7 and on MCF-7-induced angiogenesis, we hypothesize that hsp90 and PARP are involved in the GcMAF signalling pathway. These results also open the perspective of studying HIV-associated angiogenesis in NADCs with the goal of controlling the progression of NADCs via inhibition of angiogenesis.

HPV infections may cause squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, which may progress from low grade to high grade and may be found in areas adjacent to squamous cell carcinoma. HPV DNA was found in 88% of anal cancer in one study and in more than 90% of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. We present our experience in the treatment of anal condylomata, and in particular our histological findings after surgery. Patients and methods: Background: Breast and lung cancers were the most frequent non-AIDS-non-virus related tumors in our integrated database (also presented in this Conference) in the period 1999-2009. Methods: Descriptive case series analysis. Results: Ten breast cancers and 23 lung cancers were diagnosed among 4,937 HIV-infected patients. Breast cancers: At presentation, six patients were between 25 and 44 years-old, three between 45 and 64 and one male was 66. Cancer diagnoses were made at HIV diagnosis in only two and five patients were already on cART. CD4+ T-cell counts at cancer ranged between 70 and 1,514/mm 3 with nadir between 12 and 409/mm 3 . All were adenocarcinoma (8/10 ductal). Over a follow-up of 1-6 years, all patients but one survived. Lung cancers: At presentation, five patients were between 30 and 44 yearsold, ten between 45 and 59 and eight between 60 and 74. Fifteen patients were smokers, while two patients were not (both on virologically successful HAART). Cancers occurred concomitantly with HIV diagnosis in 5/23 patients, while the remaining patients were already on follow-up (n = 18 on cART). Notwithstanding this, advanced stages (IIIB or IV) were found in all patients but 2. CD4+ T-cell counts ranged between 21 and 784/mm 3 with a nadir between 19 and 583/mm 3 . The most frequent type was squamous-cell carcinoma. Only two patients survived reaching 25 and 61 months from diagnosis. Conclusions: Breast cancers: Our data suggest that screening policy for breast cancer should be started earlier in HIV patients than currently recommended in the general population ([40-50 years). Lung cancers: Letality of lung cancer appeared to be very high probably because diagnosis was made at advanced stages. Moreover, almost all patients were already followed at cancer diagnosis. Therefore, innovative screening policies for lung cancer may warrant to be experimented and, possibly, implemented in our patients. Background: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has become the most common HIV-associated malignancy. Aim of the study was to evaluate the survival rate and the incidence of infectious complications in patients with HIV and NHL and compared with a cohort of patients without HIV. Methods: Retrospective case-control study (match 1:2) of high grade NHL in HIV-population and HIV-negative patients followed in our Hospital, from 1996 to 2008 has been performed. Age, stage, histotype, B-symptoms, chemotherapy-related toxicity, survival at week 6, 12, 24 and 48 and infectious complications were examined using univariate analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "Results: A total of 15 cases and 30 controls were successively selected. The main differences between groups observed are summarized in Table 1 . No differences in histotypes (the most common was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), stage, B-symptoms, chemotherapy-related toxicity and infectious complications rate has been observed. Conclusions: HIV-infected patients with NHL continue to have a significantly higher mortality than the general population. HIV status is not associated with an increased risk of infectious complications, however LRTIs are more common in HIV-infected patients. Introduction: The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancer is increasing among HIV-infected individuals. The two most frequent manifestations of oral HPV infection are HPV-32-associated oral warts and HPV-16-associated oral cancer. Case report: We describe a clinical case of a Caucasian 48 year-old man, HIV-infected since1995, a drug user, smoker, with chronic hepatitis C, hypertension, previous cryptococcal meningitis and anal and genital condylomatosis. He is a multi-antiretroviral-experienced patient, with poor adherence leading to frequent treatment and followup discontinuations. After one of these episodes, he came to our attention in October 2010 with an oral ulcer on the right cheek which had appeared 15 days before and showed a rapid evolution; histology and immunohistochemistry of biopsy revealed an HPV-16-related epidermoid cancer. The patient had discontinued therapy 6 months before; his viral load was thus 140,000 copies/ml and CD4+ lymphocytes were 11/?L. Total body PET/CT showed an anomalous uptake of the FDG in the right cheek mucosa and in a small right submandibular lymphnode. The patient promptly started cART again with TDF/FTC, DRV/r (800/100 mg) and RAL, chosen on the basis of previous treatment history and a resistance test. The otolaryngologists performed cancer resection, drainage of homolateral lateralcervical lymphnodes and cheek reconstruction with a pedicle flap of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. At the time of surgical intervention, in December 2010, his immune status was slightly improved, while plasma viral load became undetectable. There were no post-surgical complications and the patient was discharged in good clinical condition. The histological examination confirmed a well-differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma, with HPV-16 infection without involvement of lymphnodes and salivary glands. Discussion: infection-related and cancer-related oral lesions are frequent among HIV-infected individuals; contributing factors, in this population, may be represented by cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse. Their differential diagnosis is essential for a prompt and radical treatment. The incidence of HPV-related lesions does not seem to have decreased with the introduction of HAART. However, immunosuppression may favour progression of pre-cancerous lesions. The evaluation of primary screening and prevention programmes in this population should become a priority. Introduction: Rituximab (MabThera\u00d3, Roche) is a new biological drug used for neoplastic diseases. It is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20+ lymphocytes, and it is used in association with an adequate chemotherapy in the treatment of lymphoid tumor of the B cells line (most NHL and LLC). The mechanism of action consists in an antibody mediated destruction of the CD20+, both tumoral and not, that can cause a prolonged immunodepression; in some patients (e.g. HIV+), it can reactivate chronic silent viral infections. Case report: OF, 21 years old male from Nigeria, na\u00efve, came to our Department in May 2010, because of multiple lymphadenopathy and recent discovery of anti-HIV positivity; he had a discrete immune Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is one of the most common opportunistic diseases associated with HIV infection, and remains the most frequent malignancy in his setting [1, 2] . Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) is now recognized as the causative agent [3]. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a tumor consisting of both capillaries and fibrosarcoma-like cells. This lesion predominates in men and occurs commonly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We present a case of na\u00efve HIV-HCV positive man with cutaneous lymphoma associated KSHV and HHV8. He presented extranodal masses in the skin, on the right thigh, that measuring *2 cm in diameter. The gastrointestinal tract was not involved. The patient did not develop a lymphomatous effusion. Epidemiological and clinical features are summarized in Table 1 . We performed the skin biopsy. The diagnosis was ''location dermo-hypodermic large cell lymphoma with phenotype anaplastic, associated infection KSHV-HHV8''. Histologically, it is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells and cleft-like vascular structures with vascular channel formation (Fig. 1) . The case showed greater pleomorphism and a broader range of cell size and anaplastic features. It is the most common neoplasm occurring in HIV positive patients. Immunohistological analysis revealed that the patient was positive for CD3, CD138, MUM1/RF4, ORF73/HHV8+, CD30 and negative for C20, CD45 and CD34.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3911, "end": 3914, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3915, "end": 3917, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 143, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4575, "end": 4582, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 4881, "end": 4889, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF10"}], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "The dual-phase CT scan showed no lesions, and nuclear medicine studies with F-FDG, showed overactive area to the right thigh.

Conclusions: The early diagnosis of HIV and lymphoma associated KSHV-HHV8 allowed the beginning of antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy obtaining the regression of the tumor under. Background: Osteoporosis is recognized as one of secondary cause of HIV-associated bone disorders, but multiple vertebral osteoporotic fractures are rarely reported in HIV-infected patients. Standard treatments for osteoporosis are not defined in HIV population. Case report: We report a case of HIV+ 37 years old man presenting with low back pain in our HIV day-center. HIV infection has been diagnosed 9 years earlier. He was taking antiretroviral therapy (ARV) with lopinavir-ritonavir, zidovudine and lamivudine. Nadir CD4 T-cell counts was 248 cells/mmc and HIV viral load zenith was 112,000 c/ml. Complete virological suppression and immunological recovery (CD4 cells count 465/mmc.) was observed after 3 months of ARV. One month later the patient developed neurologic syndrome characterized by fever and right hemiparesis defined as IRIS treated with prednisone 40 mg/die with subsequent tapering reduction until 5 mg. Complete neurologic recovery was observed. After 2 months the beginning of therapy with steroids he developed low back pain. A RMN and CT of dorsal and lumbar tract documented multiple vertebral fractures with radiologic evidence of severe osteoporosis. Steroid therapy was stopped and ARV was continued. Dexa examination documented severe osteoporosis in lumbar zone T score of (-33%)-1.66 and Z score of (-33%)-1.66. All analysis excluded the presence of evident causes of secondary osteoporosis in particular hypogonadism. Calcemia value was normal. The patient refused bone vertebral biopsy and vertebroplastic surgical intervention. Therapy with alendronate was started. The low back pain persisted and after 3 months CT and RMN documented no improvement of radiological picture. Considering the severity and the presence of multiple vertebral fractures, teripatide was started and administered at the dose of 20 lg/die/s.c. After 2 months the patients reported reduction of low back pain. Teripatide was administered for 18 months. Control of Dexa documented in lumbar zone T score of (-38%)-1.93 and Z score of (-37%)-1.92. Control of RMN documented reduction of edema of spongiosa and didn'find any new fractures. The patient did not report pain and other new fractures during other 1 year of followup. Conclusion: Osteoporosis and osteopenia is an emerging problem in HIV population associated to use of ARV and to HIV itself. In our case severe osteoporosis was observed in a very young patient without significant risk factors except for corticosteroid use and very short exposition to ARV therapy. Standardized screening for osteopenia and osteoporosis is suitable for all HIV infected patients after the diagnosis or before starting ART to prevent bone fractures and reduce risk factors exposition. Teripatide may represent a potential and useful agent for management of severe HIV-associated osteoporosis. Progressive Disseminated Histoplasmosis (PDH) is an AIDS defining opportunistic infection rarely reported in Italy, mostly in migrants but with few autochthonous cases as well. The diagnosis is challenging because the disease is rare and the urinary specific test is unavailable in Europe. Currently in Europe the diagnosis can be S84", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "ICAR 2011: Abstracts achieved by histopathological exam or culture isolation performed only in biosafety level 3 laboratory (Antinori 2006). A 35 years old Ecuadorian man, in Italy since 7 years, admitted the 20/12/2010 with a 1 month history of high fever, weight loss and dry cough resistant to oral antibiotics. Past clinical history was unremarkable and physical examination showed nothing relevant, except for fever (39\u00b0C). At blood exams elevated transaminases (AST 196 UI/mL, ALT 129 UI/mL), high LDH (1,681 UI/mL), CRP (108 mg/dL), ESR (51 mm/h), ferritin ([16,000 ng/mL). Normal blood gas analysis. Chest X-ray showed a paracardiac right opacity better studied by chest CT-scan with evidence of medium lobe pseudonodular infiltrate, bilateral ground glass areas and 3 cm mediastinum colliquated adenopathies. At abdominal ultrasound presence of 13.5 cm splenomegaly, confirmed by abdominal CT scan. HIV1-2 Ag-Ab screening test was positive. HIV1 RNA was 3 9 10 6 UI/mL with a CD4 count of 31/mm 3 -8.2%; HBV markers negatives; HCV Ab and viremia negatives; previous infection by CMV, EBV, HSV1, T. gondii; TPHA 1:640, RPR 1:1. Quantiferon and TTs negatives, three sputum samples negatives for mycobacteria. Six samples of blood colture negatives, ongoing the mycobacterial ones. CMV PCR was 22,000 cp/mL. The 22/12 empirical first line antitubercular treatment was started but stopped 2 days later for toxic hepatitis. Because of persistent high fever, the 27/12 empirical iv therapy for both M. tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria with amikacin, ethambuthol and rifabutin was started without improvement. More aggressive diagnostic tests were performed: the 30/12 bone marrow and liver biopsy, the 31/12 bronchoscopy, blood samples collected for Leishmania PCR, Aspergillus galactomannan (AGM) assay, H. capsulatum and T. cruzii serology, blood slides for malaria. Because of surprising positivity of AGM (DO 4.49), the 4/01 liposomal amphotericin B 4 mg/kg/day was started, being the less interactive drug with PI-based HAART prescribed the same day. Again surprisingly the 10/01 histological exam on liver and bone marrow samples resulted positive for H. capsulatum, even if the serology was negative. Therapy was confirmed, the 9/01 patient became afebrile with clinical recovery and normalization of blood values. This case highlights the need of considering PDH in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin in AIDS mostly in patients from endemic area and the importance of a rapid aggressive approach in order to avoid fatal outcome (Faggi 2001 Introduction: Avascular necrosis (AVN) is increasingly recognized as a complication of HIV infection during the era of HAART with incidence higher than 50 times the rate expected in the general population. AVN results from poor arterial blood supply to the bone and it has been related to both the use of proteasis inhibitor (PI) and to HIV-1 infection itself, along with traditional risk factors (corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, smoking, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, coagulopathies). Case reports: Three cases of AVN were identified from 2007 to 2010 in HIV-infected outpatients attending our HIV Clinic in Reggio Emilia. Patient 1, 33-year-old man, stage C3, ANV of the right tibia, presenting the following risk factors: short-course steroid (given for the treatment of Pneumocystis jeroveci pneumoniae) and moderate hypertriglicerid. Patient 2, 47-year-old man, stage B2, AVN of the right femoral head, with risk factors from diabetes mellitus and BMI \\19 kg/m 2 . Patient 3, 56-year-old woman, stage B3, presented with bilateral femoral necrosis, and severe osteoporosis as a predisposing factor. Other risk factors were not present.Two of the above patients presented HIV viral-load [1,000,000 copies/ml at the moment of HIV diagnosis; HAART was based on PI/r + NRTI on all three patients. ANV was diagnosed 8 months after the beginning of HAART (range 5-12 months), by that time all the patient reached a good immunological recovery (14% mean increasing in the CD4 count from the beginning of HAART) e complete virological suppression. ANV diagnosis was driven by the presence of pain syntoms in the area of the joint and later confirmed by MNR examination. All patients went through hyperbaric oxygen therapy and reached regression of the pain sinthomatology. Stabilization of necrosys (FOCI) took place on all but case 1, where instead it was witnessed a worsening during the first year involving multiple areas (femur, shoulder, heel, contralateral tibia), later followed by stabilization and partial improvement. Case 1 received even pulsed magneto therapy; case 1 and 3 were treated with bisphosphonates. Discussion: Clinical suspicion and early detection (thanks to RMN, the most sensitive diagnostic tool) remains the best prognostic factor for a successful medical treatment of osteonecrosis, regardless of causes. As reported in some case-studies, ANV may appear even after a few moths from the beginning of HAART typically associated with a good virological and immunological response. As this cases suggest, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may have a role in the pathogenesis of the AVN. Symptoms of hyponatremia are largely due to CNS dysfunction and more evident when decrease in the serum Na+ concentration is large or rapid. This case report shows the impact of this electrolyte imbalance in the context of comorbidities affecting a newly diagnosed AIDS presenter. A 29-years-old homosexual Brazilian man presented to Emergency Department complaining of headache and vomiting and weight loss. Vital parameters and blood tests were all normal except for Na+ (117 mmol/L). He presented multiple bluish nodules on skin and soft palate alike these of Kaposi's Sarcoma. On neurologic examination the patient was oriented, but shows muscle weakness on right arm and leg. A CT scan of the brain shows a lesion of 40 mm in the right parietal lobe with perilesional edema and a left periventricular mass of about 18 mm. HIV test required in emergency was positive. CD4+ count was 36/mmc (5%) and HIV-RNA 91,390 copies/mL. Examination of CSF revealed 43 cells/mmc. Cryptococcus antigen, search for mycobacteria were negative. PCR for T. gondii was positive, neurotropic virus, Mycobacteria and Treponema were all negative. The HIV-RNA level in CSF was 28,740 copies/m. TPHA was positive (1:20,480 ). An EGDS showed bluish-red vegetations in gastric antrum and in the second duodenal portion suggesting for KS. A total body CT demonstrated on chest scan a consolidation in left lower lobe; no abnormalities on abdominal scan. Fluid and electrolyte replenishment, anti-edema and anti-toxoplasma therapy (cotrimoxazole) and azithromycin (prophylaxis anti MAC) were started since the admission, but soon he developed leukopenia and cotrimoxazole is replaced by clindamycin. An attempt to start ART with LPV/r, 3TC+AZT, was stopped after 6 days because CI 8.3-10.3), reporting a previous STI (OR 2.7; 95% CI 2.4-2.9), and age older than 26 years (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.9-2.5). Conclusions: The data from the Italian STI Sentinel Surveillance System show that HIV prevalence among STI patients is higher than that reported by other European STI surveillance systems, such as UK and the Netherlands (McGarrigle CA et al., Sex Transm Infect 1998; Op de Coul ELM et al., Euro Surveill 2006) . HIV infection circulates more frequently among persons with an ulcerative STI or genital warts. The relevant proportion of STI patients with undiagnosed HIV infection stresses the need for an active proposal of HIV testing (including the opt-out approach) among persons with a STI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2564, "end": 2575, "text": "(Faggi 2001", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6391, "end": 6400, "text": "(1:20,480", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7291, "end": 7337, "text": "(McGarrigle CA et al., Sex Transm Infect 1998;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7338, "end": 7380, "text": "Op de Coul ELM et al., Euro Surveill 2006)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "The Regional Public Health System of Tuscany recently achieved remarkable successes in fighting AIDS with fewer than 10 deaths per year of diagnosis in 2008 and 2009 in a population of almost 4 million residents. Of the many factors that contributed to this success, here we shall focus on results obtained by accurate epidemiological surveillance conducted by the Regional Agency for Health (Agenzia Regionale di Sanit\u00e0). It is worth noting that a regional registry of new HIV infections is not yet available; therefore the data reported here refer only to new AIDS cases. However, the very low numbers of AIDS deaths (2 in 2008 and 7 in 2009) seem to indicate that surveillance of new AIDS cases is probably the most effective epidemiological tool in fighting AIDS. In fact, data from the regional registry of new AIDS cases reveals that the male-to-female ratio for the incidence of AIDS has been essentially constant from 1985 to 2008 at *3.6, whereas the purported mode of transmission changed drastically: from *8% of HIV being transmitted heterosexually in [1985] [1986] [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] , to *44% being transmitted in that way in 2006-2008. Consistent with these data, in recent years (updated to 2009), 44.5% HIV-positive heterosexuals reported being aware of their serostatus before the diagnosis of AIDS, and 17.8% had been treated with antiretroviral drugs prior to the diagnosis of AIDS. Conversely, about 90% HIV-positive intravenous drug users reported knowing their serostatus before the diagnosis of AIDS, and 57% of them were treated with antiretroviral drugs before the diagnosis of AIDS. Regrettably, however, the probability of survival in the HIVpositive intravenous drug user population has been constantly lower than that observed in the other categories since 1996. Drugassociated multi-organ toxicity might have contributed to this phenomenon. Also the age trend for new AIDS cases shows interesting changes that might have contributed to the decline in AIDS mortality in Tuscany. In 1988, the mean age for new AIDS cases was 31 for males and 28 for females, whereas in 2009 the mean ages were 44.5 and 40, respectively. We believe that information strategies focussed on risky sexual behaviours might have contributed to this trend. In fact, a recent survey of teenagers' sexual behaviour (Indagine EDIT 2008) showed that 43.5% of teenagers had had actual sexual intercourse and only 37.9% (males) and 26.4% (females) teenagers reported more than three partners. Among female teenagers reporting more than three partners, 45% reported using condoms. Taken together, these most recent data are consistent with previous observations on AIDS epidemiology (Ital J Anat Embryol. 2009 Apr-Sep;114 (2-3): 97-108. Oct-Dec;114 (4):179-91), and may suggest that further improvement in AIDS patient survival could be achieved by focussing efforts on reducing or eliminating drug-associated toxicity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1064, "end": 1070, "text": "[1985]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1077, "text": "[1986]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1084, "text": "[1987]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1091, "text": "[1988]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1098, "text": "[1989]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1105, "text": "[1990]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S72 ICAR 2011: Abstracts"}, {"text": "ICAR 2011: Abstracts The great progress in antiretroviral therapy have dramatically changed the evolution of HIV disease in the general population contributing to perceive the problem as solved: but the HIV epidemic continues to be present. The absence of effective public awareness campaigns and information on how to prevent infection, have led to a reduction in the number of HIV tests carried out. In order to promote information-educational intervention in Florence was designed a study to raise awareness and offer HIV testing to the general population. This epidemiological survey is designed to provide information on the prevalence of HIV in the Florence area. Assuming a prevalence of 1/1,000 in this area you need to performed 10,000 tests. The project began in March 2010 with an information campaign on 'HIV with material and brochures available in the main venues of the population, in the sites of medical general practices and in the collection centers where you can have the HIV test. The second phase of the study began in April 2010 after a period of training of nurses working in the collecting centres in Florence with the offer of the HIV test to all those who perform a general blood examinations. Blood samples collected were processed in the laboratory of serology in SM Annunziata Hospital in Florence. The HIV test is made after signing the informed consent from the patient is free of charge, in respect of privacy and if the patient so wishes, with full anonymity. The target population of this study is mainly composed of adults, were deliberately excluded the infectious diseases clinics and those of SERT in order to avoid selection bias. The time of the collection will continue until you reach the amount required but not later than October 2011. At December 31, 2010 patients who have joined the initiative have been 4,539. Only one patient resulted HIV positive and he has been sent to the Infectious Diseases Unit of SM Annunziata Hospital, where he began the routine specialist checks. The relevance of such awareness campaigns to increase the offer to the test is of great importance not only in the aspect of health education, but also in the early diagnosis of HIV-infected patients by ensuring an appropriate treatment. Considerable efforts are expended for prevention of HIV infections and for treatment of HIV-positive individuals, and it is widely agreed that improvements in both areas would be highly desirable.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S88"}, {"text": "Observing and understanding the epidemiology of HIV are centrally necessary for the design of strategies for both prevention and for treatment. The way to improvement is to focus not on successes but on gaps to be filled or missteps to be corrected, so we discuss weaknesses of current practices and conundrums, why expected successes have not materialized. The fundamental uncertainty stems from the lack of a gold-standard HIV test. As a result, one cannot accurately compare HIV data from different global regions that use different testing protocols, for example, varying criteria for what constitutes a positive Western Blot or the availability or nonavailability of PCR or culture tests, or drawing inferences about HIV infection based on the Bangui definition of AIDS. In addition to uncertainty in cross-country comparisons, lack of the gold standard entails a fundamental inability to detect, analyze, and correct for false-negative and false-positive test-results by direct means rather than indirect inferences. Therefore, considerable effort would seem to be warranted to prepare pure samples of HIV for establishment of a true gold-standard HIV test. The weaknesses in testing practices may well account for at least some of the troubling conundrums and mutually contradictory data that seem inexplicable. These troubling conundrums include: conflicting estimates of HIV infections and of HIV-disease deaths from equally authoritative sources; apparently drastically different primary modes of transmission in different geographic regions (primarily among drug injectors in Russia and Eastern Europe, primarily among married couples in sub-Saharan Africa, primarily among gay men and drug addicts in the United States and Western Europe); extreme racial disparities in HIV infection, with Asians and Asian Americans consistently less affected, by about one-third, than white Americans, while black Americans are affected by as much as an order of magnitude more than white Americans. Testing uncertainties doubtless also contribute to the confusion as to whether certain conditions (e.g. lipodystrophy or nephropathy) should be described as HIV-associated or as AIDS-associated. Although it is the timehonoured practice in science that such anomalies or conundrums are quarantined in the expectation that progress will eventually resolve them without research focused directly at the anomalies, it would seem in the case of HIV/AIDS that specific efforts would be worth pursuing to resolve at least some of these conundrums, because a better understanding would improve epidemiological data and understanding and help toward the design of better strategies for prevention and treatment. (1) HIV would cause a huge epidemic in Africa, but not in any other continent despite global prevalence since 1985, and that (2) it would cause a steady rather than a classical bell-shaped epidemic, selflimited by immunity like all other new pathogenic viruses. Surprisingly, we found that the WHO does not even list any South African AIDS case from 1996 until 2007, and that Statistics South Africa attributed only about 10,000 deaths per year to HIV between 2000 and 2005, and thus 30-fold less than those reported by Chigwedere et al. In a further effort to find independent evidence for the reportedly new AIDS epidemic, we searched for losses of lives in South African population growth curves. Surprisingly, we found that South Africa had increased by 3 million between 2000 and 2005 extending a steady growth rate of 500,000 per year, based on statistics from South Africa, the US and the World Bank. This gain was an integral part of a monotonic growth trajectory from 29 million in 1980 before the AIDS era to 49 million in 2008. During the same time Uganda increased from 12 to 31 million, and Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole doubled from 400 to 800 million, despite high prevalence of antibodies against HIV. We deduce that the predicted epidemiological pattern of a new killing virus never showed up in Africa, and that HIV cannot be considered a killer virus from the demographic point of view. ' what was the current perception of the HIV problem in our society), showed how most people think that HIV can be defeated, even though there still is a misinformation about transmission modality, especially about sexual behaviour.

Conversely, the levels of CD8 T cells were higher in HIV-1 infected than HIV-1 uninfected children (p = 0.030); the expansion was mostly due to the memory CD8CD45RA-cell subset (p = 0.009). Moreover, results showed that the number of activated CD8CD38+ T cells increased along with HIV-1 plasma viremia (r = 0.403, p \\ 0.0001). The proportion of Tregs positively correlated with HIV-1 plasma viremia (r = 0.323, p = 0.002), while inversely correlated with CD4 T cells (r = -0.312, p = 0.004), suggesting a selective expansion along with increased viremia and CD4 T cells depletion. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between CD8CD38+ activated cells and Tregs, considering both cell number (r = 0.305, p = 0.005) and percentage (r = 0.220, p = 0.040). Furthermore, the proportion of Tregs tended to correlate with HIV-1 DNA load (r = 0.224, p = 0.062). Conclusions: These findings suggest that chronic immune activation persists in children with poor virological response to antiretroviral therapy and may contribute to the expansion of Treg cells. In turn, the suppressive activity of Tregs may impair effector responses against HIV-1 but appears to be ineffective in limiting immune activation.PO 07 LONG TERM IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION IN HIV-POSITIVE RELAPSE/REFRACTORY LYMPHOMA PATIENTS AFTER AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION S.

The imbalanced participation of these cells during HIV infection may be an important factor determining the pathogenesis of the disease and affecting its course. Our previous analyses have shown the lack of differences in number of T reg cells in peripheral blood of HIV Progressors and LTNP, in the expression of CXCR4 on their membrane, activity, and no association with viral load. Methods: We enrolled HIV infected patients, naive to ART with progressive infection, long-term non progressors (LTNP) and healthy controls. Analyses of Treg and Th17 cells in peripheral blood were performed by antibody staining and cytofluorimetry. Expression of array of genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed by use of commercially available PCR Array kit simultaneously analysing 84 different genes included in array (Qiagen, Th17 kit).

Recent evidences suggest a direct role of HIV infection in the pathogenesis of cardio-vascular diseases (CVD). However, it is still unclear whether chronic inflammation, endothelial cell activation, and the activation of the peculiar cytokine networks characteristic of HIV infection are associated with the increased prevalence of atherosclerosis disease. Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate possible associations between inflammation, metabolic factors and endothelial alterations in HIV-infection. Materials and methods: Sixty-eight HIV-infected patients (45 ARTtreated and 23 naive individuals) were enrolled in the study.

Ospedaliera San Paolo, Medicina III, Dipartimento di Medicina, Chirurgia e Odontoiatria, Milan, ItalyBackground: HIV infection is associated with disimmunity, chronic inflammation and coagulation activation. The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) participates in the activation of protein C, an important regulator of coagulation and inflammation and possesses itself anti-inflammatory activities; its soluble form is shed from the endothelium and found in plasma. Maraviroc (MVC) is a CCR5 antagonist with anti-inflammatory properties. Aim of the study was to evaluate changes of coagulation and inflammation markers in chronically infected multi-experienced HIV+ patients, treated or not with MVC-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: 88 HIV+ patients (70 men, 18 women) treated with MVCbased (n = 45) or PI-based therapy (n = 43) were evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. D-dimer, sEPCR, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and hsCRP were measured as well as metabolic variables. Results: At baseline MVC treated and not treated groups differed only for triglycerides levels (median level 134 mg/dL vs. 214, p \\ 0.01). Such difference was observed also at week 4 and week 12, after which the non MVC treated group reached similar levels to the treated one. Similarly, HDL-cholesterol was higher in the MVC treated group at weeks 4 and 12 (week 4: median 44 mg/dL vs. 35 and week 12: 48 vs. 35, p \\ 0.01 and \\0.05). CD4+ cell counts were significantly higher in the MVC treated group starting from week 4 and up to week 48, and so were CD4/CD8 ratios and CD4 percentages starting from week 12 (p \\ 0.05). Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) increased over time in both treatment groups, though not significantly. Finally, in MVC treated patients, absolute changes of sEPCR levels were positively correlated with changes in CD4+ cell counts (Spearman rho = 0.476, p \\ 0.01) and negatively correlated with changes in HIV-RNA (Spearman q = -0.429, p \\ 0.01), while in non MVC treated patients a negative correlation was observed only between absolute changes of sEPCR levels and changes in CD4+ cell counts (Spearman q = -0.377, p \\ 0.05). Discussion: The use of Maraviroc in this population of multi-experienced HIV-1+ patients seems to positively affect the lipid profile of the studied population. Moreover, CD4 cell gain is much more pronounced and rapid in those patients treated with MVC-based ART. Interestingly, the increase of sEPCR, as marker of endothelial integrity, could be a marker of the rapid immune reconstitution observed in the MVC group.PO 50 MENOPAUSE IN HIV INFECTED PATIENTS: WOMEN IN A MIDLIFE POLYPATHOLOGY CRISIS C.

Median CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA values in CSF and in plasma were 129 cells/lL, 2.39 log 10 /mL and 2.06 log 10 /mL, respectively. A neurologic disorder was diagnosed in 56% of patients. Of the 301 samples, 107 (35%) had undetectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma, and 155 (51%) undetectable values in CSF. Overall median value of antiretroviral CPE 2010 ranking was 7 (IQR 6-8). By multivariate linear regression analysis, higher CPE 2010 ranking was associated with lower value of HIV-RNA in CSF in patients with concomitant suppressed plasma viremia (b coefficient = -4,927.1; 95% CI -8,389.1-1,465.1; p = 0.006), but not in patients with HIV-RNA detectable in plasma (b coefficient = 2,496; 95% CI -39240 35.156,9; p = 0.91). Previous AIDS, latest CD4 count and a diagnosis of neurologic disorder were not associated with CSF viremia. Sensitivity analysis indicated CPE ranking cut-off of six as highly predictive. Age, gender, HIV transmission route, number of ARV drugs, ARV drug class (PI/r, PI, or NNRTI) did not correlate in univariate analysis and were not included in the final model.Conclusions: Higher CPE 2010 ranking effectively predicts CSF HIV suppression in patients with undetectable HIV-RNA in plasma. On the contrary, CPE predictive value does not seem the same in individuals with plasma active replicating virus. This could be explained by factors as HIV resistance, poor adherence or immune activation that may offset CPE in the context of virological failure. These results may have relevant implications for clinical strategy in order to characterize patients at higher risk of CSF/plasma discordant HIV-1 suppression. 29 HIV ASSOCIATED NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS: DIFFERENCES IN DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ACROSS ITALIAN HIV CLINICS V.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients receiving Maraviroc for 48 weeks; coreceptor tropism was assessed by Trofile enhanced sensitivity version (ESTA).

Methods: This study included 46 HIV-1 infected (all B-subtype) patients, na\u00efve to maraviroc, with viremia [10,000 copies/ml. For each patient, HIV tropism was assessed by ESTA, standard population V3-sequencing and UDPS with GS-FLX Roche. For UDPS, only V3 coding sequences detected above 0.3% of viral-species were analyzed. We particularly focused on X4 variants with prevalence [10% known to be clinically relevant for response to maraviroc (Swenson 2009). The association between FPR and X4 variants was assessed by Chi-square tests. Geno2pheno set at cut-off 5 was used to predict viral tropism. Results: Tropism prediction by UDPS was 93.0 and 79.1% concordant with population V3-genotyping and ESTA, respectively. By UDPS, R5 variants were always detected in all samples, irrespective of FPR values. In particular, R5 species were detected in all 8/8 patients with FPR \\5, even in some cases as predominant species (prevalence ranging from 6.1 to 87.9%), and were present with a prevalence [80% in all the patients with FPR [20. By contrast, X4 variants progressively decreased by increasing the FPR (p \\ 0.001). In particular, X4 variants were undetectable by both UDPS and ESTA in all 12 patients with FPR [60, and were present at levels [10% in 100%) patients with FPR \\2. In this latter group of patients, X4 species showed prevalence ranging from 37.3 to 93.9% of the entire viral population. Conclusions: FPR determined by population V3-sequencing can predict the burden of X4 variants. No X4 variants are detected in patients with FPR [60, thus suggesting that patients with higher FPR have even greater chances of increased activity of CCR5 inhibitors. In addition, the presence of R5 viruses in all patients, including those with very low FPR, confirms the greater pathogenetic relevance of such strains compared to X4. Overall, these results suggest that genotypic tropism testing may provide further information (beyond the classical R5 versus X4 tropism definition) for an optimal positioning of CCR5-antagonists in clinical practice.SC 17 IMPACT OF MUTATIONS OUTSIDE V3 ON CORECEPTOR TROPISM PHENOTYPICALLY ASSESSED IN SUBTYPE B HIV-1-INFECTED PATIENTS L.

MCA suggested that, although the level of variance explained by the first two dimensions was low (27%), with the first three dimensions accounting for only 40% of inertia, mutations apparently associated to DM were 140N, 145S, 169M/V, 399G, 400T, 406T, 407D and 461N. To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating all gp120 regions; sequences with all possible permutations from each patient were included. Although MCA is exploratory, and the sample size was small, some mutations can be associated with ESTA. However, the variance level explained by the included variables was relatively low. Thus, extending the analysis to include pure X4 and expanding the sample size would be desirable to allow formal statistical testing of the multivariate associations.18 SIGNATURE MUTATIONS IN V3 AND BRIDGING SHEET DOMAIN OF HIV-1 GP120 HIV-1 ARE SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DUAL TROPISM AND MODULATE THE INTERACTION WITH CCR5 N-TERMINUS C.

Saladini* 1 , A. Rosi 1 , I. Vincenti 1 , G. Meini 1 , M. Zazzi 1 Section of Microbiology, Department of Biotechnology, University of Siena, Siena, ItalyBackground: Despite the dramatic success of HAART, several factors can still compromise the efficacy of therapy ultimately leading to development of drug resistance. This problem has fostered the development of new classes of drugs like integrase inhibitors (INI) and co-receptor antagonists (CA). Notwithstanding its impressive clinical success, Raltegravir (RAL), the first FDA-licensed INI, can easily select for drug-resistant virus variants. Although mutations responsible for drug resistance have been characterized the correlation between integrase mutation profiles and INI resistance is still partial, warranting further investigation through phenotypic testing. A similar concern applies to Maraviroc (MRV), the first FDA-approved CA, which prevents virus binding to the cell membrane coreceptor CCR5. Since MRV is only active if the patient's virus is classified as CCR5-tropic, HIV tropism must be preliminary assayed, either inferred through genotypic tests or determined by phenotypic assays. Genotype-based algorithms are gaining acceptance but still lack sensitivity for minority species and may have limitations in the accuracy of tropism prediction. Thus, phenotypic assays maintain their role in direct tropism determination and improvement of genotypic assays through genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Methods: We have developed recombinant virus assays (RVA) both for the estimation of drug resistance to INI and for the characterization of viral tropism. For these purposes, pNL4-3-derived vectors harboring deletion in the integrase gene and in the gp120 region were created by inverse PCR. In both assays, recombinant virus was obtained through homologous recombination in 293FT cells cotransfected with linearized deleted vector and the corresponding purified PCR product. After 60 h the supernatant was harvested and used to infect only U87-CXCR4 cells (INI assay) or both U87-CXCR4 and U87-CCR5 cells (tropism assay). In the INI assay, after 7-10 days of culture in U87-CXCR4 cells the virus was titrated in TZM-BL cells and used to infect in triplicate TZM-BL cells in the presence of five-fold dilutions of RAL. In the tropism assay, after 7-10 days supernatants from both U87-CXCR4 and U87-CCR5 cells were collected and used to infect separately TZM-BL in triplicate. After 48 h virus activity was detected and titrated, allowing virus classification in CCR5 tropic, CXCR4 tropic or dualmixed tropic. Results: During the first tests, the IC 50 of RAL of wild-type virus was estimated to be 4 nM, while the IC 50 of a recombinant virus harboring resistance mutations G140S and Q148H was 760 nM (fold change 190), comparable to values reported in similar experiments with other phenotypic systems. Optimization of the different INI resistance assay steps is under way in order to define the most convenient procedure. A series of recombinant viruses incorporating the patient-derived gp120 have been obtained and tropism analysis is being performed. Conclusions: The RVA developed in our laboratory can be successfully used to study susceptibility to RAL and other INI in vitro as well as to define HIV tropism phenotypically. Expected applications include both clinical use (e.g. unclear mutational patterns) and research studies, particularly characterization of investigational INI and generation of tropism phenotype-genotype correlation datasets to improve the accuracy of genotypic tropism assays.SC 21 EAT VOLUME IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS G.

Based on these facts, a multicenter cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2008 by Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT) to provide an accurate picture of HBsAg+ chronic liver disease in Italy. The aim of the present analysis is to describe characteristics of current anti-HBV treatment in relation to HIV-infection status. patients. Conversely, they were less likely to be alcohol abstainers (27.1 vs. 44.5%) and to have had a diagnosis of HBsAg+ since\\2 years (11.2 vs. 20.9%).

With regard the stage of infection, for 57 individuals (with a CD4 cell count [350 cells/mmc or missing, or without avidity test) was not possible to define the stage of infection. 180/225 MSM (80.0%) were longstanding infections. Of these, 68 had a late diagnosis. Of the 45 RI identified, 23 (51.2%) were classified through the avidity assay. Of the 282 young MSM diagnosed, 114 (40%) accepted to answer to the behavioral questionnaire. Among these, 104 (91%) reported having [1 casual male sex partner during the 12 months prior the HIV diagnosis; 63/104 reported [5 partners. Of 114 responders, 40 and 96%, respectively, reported unprotected anal or oral sex, and 50% reported using illegal drugs before o during sex.

Study design and methods: A prospective cohort study started in 2005 in which HIV-infected patients were evaluated for CV risk factors at baseline and annually during regular medical care visits at Second Infectious Diseases Outpatient Clinic. For each patient the following variables were evaluated: age, sex, body mass index, risk factor for HIV acquisition, date of HIV diagnosis, CDC stage, HIV-RNA, CD4 T cell count, coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus, cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, drug addiction, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, previous CV diseases, familiar history of CV diseases, antiretroviral therapy (ARV) and other current therapies. CV risk was estimated by Framingham risk score (FRS). Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney non-parametric test were used to compare groups respectively for categorical or continuous variables. Results: until to December 31, 2009, 1,016 patients were enrolled in the study. At enrolment the median age of patients was 41 years (IQR 36-46); 74.4% of patients were males; 57.1% of patients acquired HIV infection by heterosexual contact, 22.7% were men having sex with men, and 18.5% were intravenous drug abusers (DAs).

Currently, about 30% of HIV positive patients suffer from LS. For these reasons we developed a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic program, funded by Regione Piemonte, aimed at working on changeable lifestyles, to reverse and control some metabolic alterations and to cope with the distress related to change in body image. The follow-up is based on the patient's needs and is carried out by the multidisciplinary group composed of specialists in HIV, a nutritionist, a dietician, a psychologist, a cardiologist, a kinesiologist and plastic surgeons. Methods: We chose Nordic Walking (NW) because of its effects on muscle and cardiovascular activation that make it appropriate for metabolic syndrome. We practiced NW twice a week for 12 weeks in a large park in Turin. 13 patients joined the group, 11 Male, 2 Female, aged 33-69 years old. At T0 and T1 (12 weeks) metabolic profile and cardiovascular risk were assessed, the patients underwent spirometry and kinesiological tests (flexibility, monopodalic balance, adapted Cooper test). At T1 a satisfaction and self-evaluation questionnaire was given. Preliminary results: Patients who maintained a high attendance improved their metabolic profile and kinesiological test results. The questionnaires reported high level of satisfaction about activity, setting and the group's heterogeneous composition and high perception of improvement of physical appearance, quality of life and general health. Discussion: Our goal is to continue to work on changeable lifestyles (smoking, diet, physical activity, etc.) to improve quality of life, realizing again the APE protocol expanding the participants number. The next step will be to develop the APE as LS prevention in patients who start the antiretroviral therapy.PO 60 SWITCHING TO DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR FROM LOPINAVIR/ RITONAVIR OR FOSAMPRENAVIR/RITONAVIR IMPROVES METABOLIC ASSESSMENT IN HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS F.

Mastroianni 1 Sapienza Universita`, Polo Pontino, Latina, Italy; 2 Sapienza Universita`di Roma, Unita`di Malattie Infettive, Rome, ItalyBackground: The introduction of the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for diagnosing TB infection gave promising results in immunocompetent patients, but the value of these tests in HIV/TB coinfection is still unclear, especially in late presentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of commercial Quanti-FERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-G) as a tool to identify TB infection in patients with late presentation of HIV. Methods: A total of 197 HIV-infected individuals with suspected TB were tested with QFT-G. The median CD4 count of the HIV-infected population was 219 cells/ll (range 4-995 cells/ll), and 45 (22%) patients had a CD4 count \\200 cells/ll. Statistical analysis in the patients was performed using Spearman rank correlation tests. Results: The QFT-G test was positive in 35 (18%) subjects, negative in 122 (62%), and indeterminate in 40 (20%) subjects. The level of agreement between QFT-G and TST was 68% (? = 0.30) and QFT-G sensitivity was 66% (95% CI 47-82). Patients with positive QFT-G results had significantly lower CD4 counts than those with a negative QFT-G (median 177 vs. 467 cells/ll, p = 0.001). The lowest CD4 counts (median 97 cells/ll) were found in subjects with indeterminate QFT-G results. The univariate analysis confirmed that a CD4 count \\200 cells/ll was strongly associated with an indeterminate result (OR 5.80, 95% CI 2.13-16.18, p \\ 0.001). Conclusions: These data indicated that the severe CD4 count deficit affects the performance of QFT-G and it is a limitation of this test in subjects with late presentation of HIV infection. Thus, the performance of immunologic assays and its potential as a rule-out test for active TB is impaired in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression.PO 62 HCV OCCULT INFECTION IN HIV POSITIVE SUBJECTS: DOES IT EXIST?

Moscati, Avellino, ItalyIntroduction: HCV occult hepatitis is defined by the presence of HCV-RNA in liver issue and/or peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) without seric anti-HCV and HCV-RNA. It has been found in subjects with sustained virological response after anti-viral therapy and in subjects with high levels of seric transaminases of unknown origin.HCV occult infection has also been found in immunocompromised hemodialysed patients, without seric anti-HCV and HCV-RNA with persistent high levels of transaminases. Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of HCV occult infection among HIV positive (+)/anti-HCV/HCV-RNA negative patients, by searching HCV-RNA in PBMC. Patients and methods: We have enrolled 45 consecutive HIV+/anti-HCV/HCV-RNA negative patients (Case Group),observed from January to April 2009. Risk factors for HIV were sexual contacts (91.2%),intra-venous drug abuse (6.6%),vertical transmission (2.2%).From each patient we have drawn a blood sample and samples of PBMC, frozen at -80\u00b0C.For each patient we have detected biochemical markers of liver function, HBV and HCV markers, CD4 cells count, HIV-RNA at the enrollment, CD4 nadir and therapeutic history. As Control Goup, we have enrolled seven consecutive HIV neg/anti-HCV/HCV-RNA pos patients, observed at the time of liver biopsy. We have detected HCV-RNA on plasma and PBMC of both groups of patients. In all PBMC samples, we have also searched mRNA of G6PDH, present in every human cell. Results: Among Cases, every patient showed the alteration of at least a marker of liver function. At the enrollment, the median value of CD4 was 717 cells/lL; 84.4% of the subjects were on HAART. In all our Cases, HCV-RNA was not detectable in PBMC, while it was present in all controls. Both in cases and in controls, the detection of mRNA of G6PDH was positive in all patients. Conclusions: The anti-HIV+/anti-HCV neg patients enrolled could have been exposed to HCV by parenteral and sexual contacts. Though there is a high risk, HCV occult infection has not been observed in our 45 cases. It is possible to exclude a low sensitivity of our method, infact HCV RNA is positive in PBMC samples of all controls and mRNA of G6PDH is positive in all PBMC samples both in Cases and Controls. The absence of HCV occult infection observed in our cases may be related to the good immune condition of patients enrolled, critical for the control of HCV replication in plasma and PBMC.It has not been possible to examine liver issue in these patients without clear indication to liver biopsy.PO 63 EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS LOAD AND IMMUNE ACTIVATION IN HIV-1 INFECTED PATIENTS M.R.

Mean age was 34.7 years. 165 patients (14.3%) were HIV+, 6.1% HBV+ and 2.6% HCV+. 94% presented a perianal localization, 62% an endoanal (4.6% only endoanal), and 35.8% a genital localization. 967 patients were submitted to surgery in one or more sessions. Results: Histological exam revealed a degeneration in 62 patients (6.4%). 48 of these patients were HIV+ (77.48% of degenerations); and 2 patients were immunosuppressed (3.2%). Other 24 patients were immunocompetent. When we consider all series degenerations occurred in 29% of HIV+ patients versus 2.4% of HIV-patients. In particular histological exam revealed 13 AIN I; 7 AIN II; 6 AIN III; 11 Buschke Lowenstein neoplasms, 15 Bowen disease or Bowenoid papillomatosis; 3 carcinomas in situ; 7 squamous or basaloid carcinomas (3 of these were multifocal). Patients with diagnosis of Buschke Lowenstein tumour was submitted to radical surgery; patients with anal carcinoma to RT + CT or to surgical excision; and other patients to surgical excision. All patients are actually in follow up. Conclusions: HPV related perianal condylomata become increasingly frequent. Clinical diagnosis is simple. However, histopathological examination should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to detect precancerous or cancerous changes, mainly in HIV+ patients. Molecular biological techniques allow identification of the HPV genotype so detecting the oncogenic strains. An accurate follow up is mandatory for patients revealed as malignancies to prevent transformation in anal carcinoma.

Vullo 1 1 Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, University of Rome ''Sapienza''; 2 Department of Drug Evaluation Italian Institute of Health ISS Rome Background: Dysregulation of adipokines is implicated in the etiology of metabolic syndrome and related to increased cardiovascular risk. In fact altered levels of adipokines are strictly related with progressive atherosclerosis in HIV negative patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome or obesity. We investigated the relationship between plasma adipokine levels and cardiovascular risk in HIV+ subjects without metabolic syndrome and with low cardiovascular risk. Methods: We studied 40 HIV+ patients 30 on a first line stable and effective antiretroviral therapy and 10 HAART naive. 10 age-matched healthy HIV-patients were included as controls. Anthropometric, metabolic and immunovirologic parameters were measured in all patients. All HIV+ patients presented low cardiovascular risk (\\10%) according to the Framingham Scoring, and did not meet criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome. The levels of leptin and adiponectin were measured using commercially available ELISA. Coronary CTscan was performed in all patients. Results: The mean age of patients was 42 years. CD4+ cell count was 396.3 cells/mmc (mean) and HIV-RNA \\50 copies/ml. The mean of metabolic and anthropometric parameters were normal in all HIV population. Coronary CT-scan did not evidence critical stenosis ([50%) in coronary vessels of all HIV+ patients but showed an increase of medium degree of stenosis respect healthy population. Plasma adiponectin (7.21 g/ml) and leptin (23.1 \u00b1 ng/ml) levels in the group of HIV positive patients under HAART were lower than in HIV+ patients naive for antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.05). On the other hand we observed that plasma adiponectin and leptin levels in healthy control subjects are higher, with a statistical significance, than HIV+ patients under HAART but not than HIV subjects naive for antiretroviral therapy Conclusions: Our data show that the adipokine levels are unexpected impaired in HIV+ patients under HAART without metabolic syndrome. Coronary risk of our cohort of HIV+ patients on antiretroviral therapy is low according to the Framingham Scoring, but dysregulation of adipokines observed predict an unexpected increase of cardiovascular risk, despite a normal metabolic profile. These data, although obtained in a small population, confirm that coronary risk is strongly underestimated by commonly used scores and indicate circulating adipokines levels as a possible marker for cardiovascular risk in HIV+ patients under HAART. HIV-1 related demyelinating polyneuropathy (HIV-DP) can be triggered by a direct action of the virus itself or be caused by antibodies capable of damaging the myelin sheets, especially when the viremia control is lacking. We present the case report of a HIV-1 infection related inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy (HIV-PRN), which improved after protease inhibitors (PIs) initiation. In July 2009, a 32-year old heterosexual and drug abuser man was diagnosed HIV-1 infection after the onset of fever, abdominal cramps, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. In September 2009 the CD4+ count was 550 (23%) and the wild-type HIV-RNA was 119,979 copies/ml. In February 2010, the CD4+ T cell-count showed a reduction to 450 cells/ mmc and a therapy with boosted Darunavir plus Tenofovir/Emtricitabine was prescribed, which the patient refused to take. In April 2010, the patient complained the acute onset of paresthesia/hypoesthesia in the soles of the feet, which within 20 days spread up to the gluteal region, and to the hands up to the wrists, also associated with weakness of the lower limbs. The patient decided himself to start the antiretroviral therapy that had been prescribed before, with subjective improvement in both sensory and motor symptoms after 1 week. The neurological exam performed after an additional week highlighted: strength impairment (MRC scale grade 4) in extensor digitorum, hand's interossei, tibialis anterior and extensor allucis longus muscles of the two sides, both pain hypoesthesia and hypopallesthesia (7/8 on the tuning-fork exam) in the feet up to the ankles and in the hand fingers, areflexia in the lower limbs, and abnormal gait. The ENG examination confirmed a demyelinating PRN. CSF examination showed elevated proteins (74 mg/dl) with no increase in cell count, 224 copies/ml of HIV-RNA, and negative PCR for both CMV-DNA and other neurotropic viruses. Because of the subjective improvement and the slight neurological signs detected, no immunomodulatory therapy (i.e. IVIg or plasmapheresis) was prescribed and antiretroviral therapy was confirmed (CD4+ 740 (27.57%), HIV-RNA \\100,000 copies/ml). The patient was then lost to follow-up. Treatment strategies for HIV-DP (i.e. IVIg and plasmapheresis) are the same as in HIV-negative patients. Despite the satisfactory therapeutic response to these treatments, there are no results available from casecontrol studies. In our patient, however, the regression of the neurological symptoms was associated with the IPs therapy. So far, the risk of neurotoxic effects due to the IPs seems to be very low if compared to its important therapeutic role. However, further studies are needed to establish their potential use in the treatment of HIV-DP.Objectives: The immigration phenomenon, as it has been registered in Italy in the last 10 years, has strongly affected the epidemiology of infectious diseases. This study aimed at: conducting an epidemiological survey on the prevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV infections, Syphilis and Tuberculosis (TB) in the immigrant population; evaluating the economical impact of appropriate prophylaxis and therapeutic strategies on the immigrant population in an area of northern Italy (Veneto Region). Methods: This survey is a multicentric-observational prospective study which involved nine Health Centres in Veneto Region. In order to guarantee a representative sample of the immigrants living in Veneto Region, each centre was asked to recruit a specific number of patients stratified according to their country of origin and their legal status (with or without a regular visa) in Italy. All patients aged [18 years and having access to care in the ER unit of each Centre for whatever health problems were invited to participate in the study. The patients enrolled were screened for HIV, HBV, HCV, Syphilis and Tuberculosis by blood tests. Moreover, all patients enrolled filled in a questionnaire in order to asses: demographic and social profile, sexual behaviour, of the immigrants tested. The patients were enrolled followed written informed consent. Results: From March 2009 to December 2010 a total of 340 immigrant patients has been enrolled in the study, 160 (47%) were male and 180 (53%) female. The 25-34 year age group was the more rappresentative (35.5%). Of the 340 patients enrolled, most (47.3%) came from South America and Southeast Asia, 36.1% from East Europa, 15.2% from Sub-Saharan Africa, only 4 patients were from West Europe. 8.5 (29)% of these were irregular immigrants. Of the 340 patients enrolled only 3 (0.8%) resulted HIV infected positive, 9 (2.6%) were HBsAg positive, 9 (2.6%) had a positive result for Hepatitis C antibody test while 8 (2.3%) for VDRL test. 25.6% (87) of the patients enrolled had a positive result for Quantiferon-TB test. The socio-demographic characteristics and anamnestic data on tuberculosis of these patients were analysed. A positive result of this test suggests that M. tuberculosis infection is likely. In these subjects active TB has to be excluded and treatment for Latent TB has to be considered. Conclusions: These preliminary results show that the prevalence of sexual transmitted diseases among immigrant patients is relatively low, respectively 0.8% for HIV infection, about 3% for HBV infection and for HCV infection, roughly 2% for syphilis, while we found an high prevalence of people with positive Quantiferon-TB test (25.6%). That suggests the importance to define and implement, as public health measure, appropriate and effective TB screening programs in the immigrant population, especially in people coming from low-income countries where TB prevalence is high, in order to control the TB transmission and prevent the rebound of TB in the developed countries. Methods: Data were obtained from the Italian STI Sentinel Surveillance System (1991 -2007 . This System collects information on STI diagnoses provided by a network of 12 public STI clinics located in main cities. Results: Between 1991 and 2007, 51,765 patients diagnosed with a STI underwent HIV testing. The overall HIV prevalence was 7.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 7.3-7.9]. Among the 3,927 HIVpositive patients, 28.3% were undiagnosed for HIV. HIV-positive patients had a mean age of 34.2 years (standard deviation \u00b1 8.6 years); more than half of them were males (76.2%); 14.7% were non-nationals; 46.9% were men having sex with men (MSM); injecting drug use was reported by 34.1% cases; 60.0% reported having had two or more partners in the previous 6 months; a previous STI was reported by 50.0% cases. When analyzing by STI diagnosis, HIV prevalence was 15.0% among patients with primary or secondary syphilis, 10.5% among patients with genital herpes, 9.6% among patients with genital warts, 7.3% among patients with gonorrhea, 4.0% among patients with non-gonococcal/non-chlamydial infections, and 2.3% among patients with chlamydia infection. At the multivariate analysis, HIV prevalence was significantly associated with injecting drug use (OR 41.5; 95% CI 36. 7-46.8 Background: Migrations are a phenomenon of world-wide dimension with the obvious political, social and economic implications. Italy, due to its geographical location, is one of the countries more affected by this problem in the world: in 2010, the foreign residents were almost 5 millions (1 immigrant every 12 residents)-XX Immigration Report of 2010-Caritas Migranteswith 3 million of migrants in the course of the last 10 years, and nearly 1 million during the last 2 years. More than 62% resides in Northern Regions of Italy; 25% in Central Regions and 13% live in the South. In between 1985 and 2008 in Italy 42.747 new HIV diagnosis have been performed (ISS-COA 2010); the proportion of migrants among the new diagnoses of HIV infection increased from 11% in 1992 to 31.6% in 2008; incidence and prevalence rates are significantly higher in migrants than in the native population: almost 20% of the AIDS cases in Italy is taking place in migrant population, and the incidence of new HIV infections in this population is equal to 60/100,000, nine times more than the local population. Moreover almost 70% of the migrants with an AIDS diagnosis have discovered HIV positivity just in the previous 6 months. Methods: To determine HIV prevalence, consecutive adult migrants in the years 2000-2010 were tested for antibodies against HIV types 1 and 2. Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutical data were collected. t Student test was employed. Results: A total of 2,930 migrants (71.3% males, median age 34.3 years, 37% from East Europe, 24.5% from Africa, 38.5% from Orient) were evaluated: 332 (11.33%) were HIV positive, 532 (18%) HbsAg positive, 177 (6%) HCV positive. Migrants HIV positive versus Italian HIV positive were: male 76 versus 71%, mean age 35 versus 39%, HCV coinfected 2 versus 44%, HBV coinfected 4 versus 5%, heterosexual transmission 51 versus 15%, CD4 nadir \\200 39 versus 24%, on HAART 11 versus 44%. Conclusions: The management of HIV infection in the migrants has the same indications of the native subject but it must exceed the linguistic-cultural differences and the difficult access to the healthservices in order to guarantee the adherence. The short time in between HIV positivity and AIDS diagnosis is related to several factors, like lack of proper information, the fear to face the disease, and we have to consider the peculiar condition of this population with particular regard to level of poor education and shortage of economical resources, traditional believes and religious issues.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 143, "text": "1 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1591, "text": "([50%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8576, "end": 8601, "text": "Surveillance System (1991", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8602, "end": 8607, "text": "-2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 9793, "end": 9799, "text": "7-46.8", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PO 47 DYSREGULATION OF ADIPOKINES IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS UNDER HAART IS A MARKERS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK?"}, {"text": "V.

Cipriani 1 Regional Health Agency of Tuscany, Florence, Italy; 2 Tuscany Region, Florence, Italy Introduction: Since 1985, AIDS cases diagnosed in health facilities throughout Tuscany are compulsorily reported to the regional AIDS registry. Today the surveillance of AIDS cases essentially gives indications on the accessibility and effectiveness of secondary prevention services but it is rather inadequate for monitoring the epidemic of acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. So, it is necessary to implement systems for monitoring HIV infection in order to identify new groups with the highest personal and behavioural risk and steer the activities of prevention. The Italian Ministry of Health-Decree of March 31 2008-has promoted the activation of the monitoring system of new diagnoses of HIV infection in Italy. The surveillance system of HIV diagnoses in Tuscany started in May 2011 and it is currently being implemented. Objective: The surveillance system of HIV infection has the following objectives: (1) to define the incidence of newly diagnosed HIV cases;(2) to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection; (3) to provide useful data for defining the demand for health services for the care of people with HIV; (4) to determine risk factors for progression of HIV infection to AIDS; (5) to plan and evaluate preventive measures. Methods: Regional surveillance for newly diagnosed HIV infection was based on cases of infection reported by structures enabled (infectious diseases units and sexually transmitted diseases unit) by the regional HIV surveillance center (Unit of Epidemiology, Regional Health Agency of Tuscany) on the first occasion of diagnosis in Tuscany. Data are collected by filling out a special regional notification form, and the regional HIV surveillance center provides for the computerization of forms received from the reporting units in a data base. Results: Preliminary data on the diagnosis of HIV infection in Tuscany will be available in the first half of 2011. However, there are currently some information on the HIV-positive individuals in care at the units of infectious diseases for the period January-September 2008. During this period, 4,457 HIV-positive patients were followed by the infectious diseases unit. Of these cases, 24.2% was female and most of patients aged between 35 and 59 years at diagnosis (61.6%). Women were younger than males: 33.4% aged between 17 and 34 years compared to 25.9% of males. Exposure to HIV for the majority (70%) of patients was sexual contact: 26.8% homosexual contact and 43.2% heterosexual contact. Of the 4,457 HIV-positive patients 14.8% (658 patients) were diagnosed with AIDS, while for the 183 subjects this information is not known. With regard to HIVpositive patients not yet on AIDS (3,616), most of them (90.4%) had a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 200. Conclusions: The monitoring system of new diagnoses of HIV infection is the best way to describe the changes of the epidemic and provide the tools needed to plan interventions for primary and secondary prevention. Background: In Italy, since 1985, confidential and voluntary HIV counselling and testing (CT) can be obtained free of charge and, when requested, anonymously, in publicly funded sites by person selfreferral (SR) or referred by a physician (PR). The HIV-CT site of the Italian National Institute for Infectious Diseases ''L. Spallanzani'', Rome, is one of the largest in Italy and represents the regional referral centre. Methods: In order to evaluate if reasons (not risk factors) for attending CT site and demographic characteristics vary over time, we retrospectively analyse data from 29,326 adults (54% women) receiving first lifetime HIV-CT divided into 5-year period each (1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009) . Results: The number of persons seeking first lifetime HIV-CT progressively decreases (8, 786, 8, 311, 5, 840, 6, 384) . The average age progressively increases (32, 33, 34, 36 years, overall median 31) , as the proportion of foreign persons (6, 8, 15, 17%) . About reasons for testing, heterosexual intercourse with partner of unknown serostatus (Het), that is the first motivation in 1990-1999 (36%), significantly decreases in 2000-2009 (26%) , when the first reason becomes pregnancy/family planning (Preg). The proportion of persons stating the use of injecting drugs (ID) as reason for HIV-CT decreases considerably (3, 1.5, 0.6, 0.4%), while an upward trend emerges in the proportion of persons who require HIV-CT because of clinical symptoms considered as 8, 9, 11%) . Other main reasons for testing, i.e. sexual intercourse with a known HIV+ partner (SP+) and homosexual intercourse with partner of unknown serostatus (Hom), remain stable. Among those PR, main reasons are Preg and suggestive symptoms, while sexual intercourse is the main reason among SR. Overall, HIV prevalence is 3.2% in men, 1.4% in women: no significant time trend is noted. HIV prevalence do not vary among foreign persons (5.1 overall). The highest prevalence is among SP+ (14.9 overall) and Hom (11.3 overall; 9.4 in 2005 -2009 . HIV prevalence among Het decreases (1.2, 0.9, 1.2, 0.6), as Preg (1.9, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3) and ID (12 in 1990 -1994 , 0 in 2005 -2009 ; conversely, HIV prevalence increases in persons who require HIV-CT for symptoms (3.2, 2.6, 7.4, 5. 2), both in SR and PR. Conclusions: our data highlights a changing pattern of persons attending CT site. The decrease of proportion of Het is in contrast with the increase of HIV-positivity among heterosexuals in Italy, and suggests that risk awareness among this population is decreasing. The increase of persons who require HIV-CT for symptoms may indicate an improved awareness of physicians and patients, or a higher proportion of late presenters. The advances in prevention, treatment and care of HIV infection support the need to optimise HIV CT programs: a better knowledge about reasons for testing should be used to develop targeted counselling and testing prevention strategies. (p = 0.0006) and actively recruited (p = 0.0001) than HBV and HCV patients. HCV patients were significantly older than HBV patients (p = 0.0018), and were more frequently drug and alcohol addicted (p = 0.0001 and 0.003, respectively At multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated to female gender (p = 0.01), drug addiction (p = 0.008), and the active way of recruitment (p = 0.04), HBV infection to male gender (p = 0.0001) and HCV to drug addiction (p = 0.0001). Among sex workers about 25% of the subjects referred not to use condom or its sporadic use, but there were no differences in HIV prevalence as compared with those reporting a systematic use of condom. Conclusions: An active recruitment can demonstrate a substantial prevalence of HIV and hepatitis infections. We can expect an escalation of the economic costs associated to chronic liver disease and HIV management and to educational and prevention campaigns. Introduction: The Cotugno Hospital in Naples since some years has been extending its interests beyond the specific mission (diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases); in view of this, and to coincide with World AIDS Day on 1 December 2010, the same has started throughout Naples a project of information and prevention about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), focusing especially on HIV, because prevention represents the most important investment in public health. Materials and methods: The organization has provided for the involvement of all the ten municipalities of Naples, with the help of an equipped bus travelling (Figure) from 29 of November to December 12 2010. Several stops has been programmed nearby secondary schools to promote encounters with some experts (specialists of infectious disease, psychiatrists), also by answering to dedicated interviews (7 multiple choice quizzes on HIV infection, using a spreadsheet on-line). The operational plan also envisioned the distribution on the same bus of brochures on both HIV infection and the services of the hospital and the presentation of the project for distance learning already made in 2009 by a multidisciplinary team of Cotugno, that offered a full explanation on AIDS and STD to students through the use of a platform for e-learning on the company website ( http://www.ospedalecotugno.it). The participants at the project received a T-shirt dedicated to the event. The ambitious proposal called ''PARLIAMONETOUR'' has been designed using an ad hoc logo and a slogan already forwarded by the ''Forum of Public Administration 2010'' (\u2026 health is contagious) and found the adhesion of some sponsors. Results: The project has involved in 14 days of activity 54 medical trainers (26 from Cotugno Hospital and 28 from public and private hospitals), and 3 facilitators and assistants; the overall respondents were 2,686 (1,385 M, 1,301 F), mostly young people and adolescents (1,712 \\20 years), with a good instructional level (1,461 with a college or university education).
