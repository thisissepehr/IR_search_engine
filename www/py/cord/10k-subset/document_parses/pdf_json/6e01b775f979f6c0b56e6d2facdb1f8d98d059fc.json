Thus, the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the early stages of the disease in young adults are crucial to reduce the incidence of end-stage HOA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether (1) a relationship among the inflammatory status of labrum and synovium collected from patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) would exist; and (2) to investigate the associations among the histopathological features of joint tissues, the pre-operative symptoms and the postoperative outcomes after arthroscopic surgery. Methods: Joint tissues from 21 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI were collected and their histological and immunohistochemical features were correlated with clinical parameters. Results: Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in 25% of FAI patients, inversely correlated with the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) pain and function subscales and with the absolute and relative change in total HOOS. All the labral samples showed some pattern of degeneration and 67% of the samples showed calcium deposits. The total labral score was associated with increased CD68 positive cells in the synovium. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the chondral damage worsened the HOOS post-op symptoms (adjusted R-square = 0.76 p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Our study reveals a relationship between the histologic labral features, the synovial inflammation, and the cartilage condition at the time of FAI.

Here we found that labral calcium crystal deposition, assessed by histology, were present in 67% of FAI patients, independent of OA radiographic grading. We also found that the presence of labral crystal calcium deposition was associated with lower pre-operative HOOS and, interestingly, with worst post-operative symptoms independent from age and radiographic severity. The same observation was previously reported [24] in end-stage OA, supporting the hypothesis that labral calcification might play a key role in hip pain and symptoms both in FAI and endstage OA. A higher local concentration of calcium crystal deposition in the labrum could lead to increased release of nociceptor stimulating substances [26, 27] within the fibrocartilage tissue, which densely innervated [42] .The presence of labral calcification is also associated with a worst labral matrix integrity and subsequent degradation of the acetabular cartilage as described by Song et al. [43] ,thus possibly jeopardizing the effect of the surgical repair [41] . Moreover, synovial tissue analyses revealed that most of our FAI patients had hyperplasia of the lining layer, focal, or widespread fibrosis and increased vascularity. These aspects are typical of the low-grade synovitis found in early OA cases [44] . Mononuclear cell infiltration is typical of end-stage OA [45] . Consistent with previous studies [20] , we found that the presence of mononuclear cell infiltration was associated with worst clinical outcomes in patients with FAI suggesting that synovial mononuclear cell infiltration might contribute to worsen the clinical condition after hip arthroscopy [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 94, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1067, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1363, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1427, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1676, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1928, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 1992, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2032, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2291, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Noteworthy, we found a positive association between the total labral score and CD68 expression in the synovial tissue.
