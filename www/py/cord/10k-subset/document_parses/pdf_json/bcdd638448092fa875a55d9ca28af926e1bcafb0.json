However fatal complications may occur. Case presentation: A 43-year-old previously healthy Taiwanese male came to our emergency department due to high fever, chills, general malaise and myalgia for about 4 days. An influenza rapid test from a throat swab was negative. Chest radiography showed mild left lung infiltration and levofloxacin was prescribed. However, progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure developed 48 h later after hospitalization. Emergent intubation was performed and he was transferred to the intensive care unit where oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche) 75 mg orally twice daily was given immediately. In the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries. However, a markedly elevated cardiac enzyme level (Troponin I level was up to 71.01 ng/ml), a positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings and no coronary artery stenosis led to the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction of endotracheal aspirates was positive for influenza B. His condition gradually improved and he was successfully weaned from the ventilator on day 22. He was discharged without prominent complications on day 35. Conclusion: Influenza B infection is not always a mild disease. Early detection, early administration of antiviral agents, appropriate antibiotics and best supportive care, is still the gold standard for patients such as the one reported.",

Both primary viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia can cause acute lung injury and even ARDS, characterized by the influx of protein-rich fluid into the air spaces as a consequence of increased permeability of the alveolarcapillary barrier. ARDS is different from congestive heart failure but always confused. According to the Berlin ARDS definition, ARDS was defined as occurred within 1 week, a chest radiograph or computed tomography scan showing bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules and respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload [9] . Based on the report of cardiac echography, no evidence of heart failure at that moment though myocarditis occurred. In addition, PaO2/FiO2 was below 200 mmHg. Therefore, we treated the patient with ARDS strategies, such as lung protective strategy and intensive care. An autopsy report of patients who died from influenza B virus infection revealed that up to 69 % of the patients had myocardial injury, predominantly in patients aged less than 18 years. Cases of adults with influenza B and myocarditis have rarely been reported. Clinical manifestations of myocarditis range from asymptomatic ECG abnormalities, arrhythmia to cardiogenic shock. Some patients have rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia and even cardiac death [10] . The most common ECG abnormality being sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST-T wave changes, which was seen in the present case. Troponin I has been reported to have a high specificity (89 %) but limited sensitivity (34 %) for the detection of myocyte injury in the diagnosis of myocarditis [11] . An endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of myocarditis but rarely performed. Recently, published guidelines have suggested that cardiac MRI should be performed in patients with suspected myocarditis [12] . MRI has the unique potential to visualize tissue changes and can detect the characteristic changes in myocarditis including intracellular and interstitial edema, capillary leakage, hyperemia and, in more severe cases, cellular necrosis and subsequent fibrosis [13] . A combination of T1and T2-weighted images with early and late gadolinium enhancement have been reported to provide the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. Our presented patients had extremely high cardiac enzyme and positive for myocardial injury based on cardiac MRI and his heart function is relatively normal.",
