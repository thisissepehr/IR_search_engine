The use of both rhesus monkey kidney and human fetal diploid cell cultures for attempts to isolate virus from human clinical specimens recovered approximately 30% more isolates from fecal, throat, skin lesion, and tissue specimens than were recovered in a single cell culture system. The sensitivities of the two cell types for isolation of viruses in the major groups infecting man are compared. The use of both BS-C-1 and RK-13 cells yielded approximately 25% more rubella virus isolates than were recovered in a single cell system. Procedures such as the establishment of cell cultures from tissues suspected of harboring viruses, cocultivation of cells from biopsy or autopsy specimens with other cell types, and the use of organ cultures, have in certain situations resulted in greater sensitivity for recovery of viruses.

These contaminants may produce a cytopathic effect or a hemadsorption reaction which masks the presence of viruses recovered from the human clinical specimens, or rare contaminants such as Herpesvirus sirniac or the Marburg agent may be extremely hazardous to laboratory workers handling the cultures. Diploid or continuous cell lines established from simian kidneys have been somewhat less sensitive than primary or secondary cells for isolation of human viruses. 8 ' 11 ' 30 Human fetal diploid lung and kidney cell lines were found to be far more sensitive than primary or secondary monkey kidney cells for isolation of rhinoviruses, 12,4S a group of more than 90 distinct virus types which produce common colds or minor upper respiratory tract infections, SCHMIDT A.J.C.P.-Vol. 57 Isolates recovered in MK and/ or H F D Isolation rate (%) and early studies indicated that human fetal diploid cell lines were highly sensitive for propagation and isolation of other human viruses as well. 7 -13 > 31 For the past 8 years, clinical specimens examined in this laboratory for the presence of virus have been inoculated into both primary or secondary rhesus monkey kidney (MK) cells and human fetal diploid (HFD) cells (either lung or kidney, depending upon the type of specimen). Rubella virus isolation attempts are performed in the BS-C-1 line of grivet monkey kidney cells and the RK-13 line of rabbit kidney cells, 39 since rhesus MK and HFD cells do not show clear-cut interference or a cytopathic effect when infected with this virus. It has been found that the parallel use of two cell culture systems contributes an appreciable number of viral isolates over those recovered in a single cell culture system.

Thus, cytomegalovirus is best propagated by mixing trypsin-dispersed, infected cells with trypsinized uninfected human fibroblast cells and planting. 2 It has been shown that hamster-adapted measles virus may be isolated in cell cultures from trypsinized, infected brain tissue, but not from homogenates of the same tissue. 4 ' 40 In this laboratory it has been found that, at low passage levels, measles and adenovirus isolates are subcultivated most effectively through the use of trypsin-dispersed, infected cells as an inoculum rather than culture fluids or cells scraped from infected cultures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 601, "end": 603, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 916, "end": 917, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1091, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1096, "text": "' 40", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modified Cell Culture Procedures Employed to Increase Sensitivity for Isolation and Subpassage of Certain Viruses"}, {"text": "The superiority of viable cells over tissue homogenates for recovery of certain viruses from autopsy or biopsy tissues has been illustrated in studies comparing virus recovery in cell cultures established from human organs obtained at autopsy or by biopsy with recovery in the usual laboratory cell culture systems inoculated with suspensions of the same organs. In attempting to isolate viruses from kidneys and other organs of children with congenital malformations, Benyesh-Melnick and colleagues 3 recovered nine isolates in cell cultures prepared from the organs themselves, but only two of these viruses were also recovered in cell cultures inoculated with suspensions of the organs. Similarly, Rawls and associates 24 recovered rubella virus from cultured cells of certain organs, but not from suspensions of the organs. The greater success of viral isolation through culturing cells from tissue specimens may be due to the need for cell-to-cell transfer of virus from viable cells, as in the case of V-Z virus, or it is possible that homogenization of organs or tissues releases viral inhibitory substances. Inhibitors for measles virus have been demonstrated in extracts of rat brain, 4 and inhibitors of dengue virus infectivity have been detected in certain organs of monkeys. 21 The cultivation of brain cells from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) together with HeLa cells 15 or BS-C-1 grivet monkey kidney cells 22 has permitted the recovery of infectious measles virus from the cells, and thus has furnished direct evidence of the etiologic role of measles virus in this clinical entity. Cultures of the brain cells alone showed the presence of measles antigen by fluorescent antibody staining, and the presence of syncytia, but infectious virus was not recoverable. Apparently the HeLa or BS-C-1 cells contributed some factor essential to the production of complete, infectious virus which was lacking or ineffective in the brain cell cultures.
