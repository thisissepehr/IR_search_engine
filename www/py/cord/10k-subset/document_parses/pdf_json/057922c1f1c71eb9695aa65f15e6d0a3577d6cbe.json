AlloBSCT is associated with an infusion of significantly larger numbers of growth factor-exposed lymphocytes and other cells, which may affect immunological reconstitution and/or the incidence of clinical complications. [11] [12] [13] [14] These putative effects could be mediated by higher frequencies of a particular cell subtype, by a different functional status of infused cells, by a higher level or a different pattern of post-transplant cytokine production, or by combination of these factors. [12] [13] [14] In the present report, patients who received alloBSCT had a significantly faster lymphocyte recovery than patients who received alloBMT. Recovery of lymphocyte subsets in the alloBSCT group was characterized by an initially more rapid increase of CD3 + /CD4 + cells than CD3 + /CD8 + cells. These findings are in contrast to alloBMT data where CD4 + T cells typically recover more slowly, resulting in consistently lower CD4/CD8 ratios, post-transplant. 7, 11, 16, 26 Rapid recovery of CD4 + cells early after alloBSCT may be a reflection of cellular and biological characteristics of the normal donor blood, in contrast to normal bone marrow where the CD4/CD8 ratio is typically less than 1.0. 27 An alternative explanation could be more rapid thymic differentiation after alloBSCT. 28 In the current study, the number of naive post-thymic CD4 + /CD45RA + T cells remained low, similar to observations after alloBMT in adults, suggesting that a more rapid thymic differentiation of CD3 + /CD4 + cells in adult alloBSCT recipients was not the case. 29, 30 Mitogen-induced T cell proliferation is considered to be a good in vitro correlate of clinical immunological recovery. 15 Very low mitogen-induced T cell responses are typically present during the first 6 to 12 months after alloBMT, reflecting a low frequency of responding percursorcells. 16, 26, [31] [32] [33] [34] In the current study, PHA-induced T cell pro- Patients were divided into those who had time for ALC recovery slower than median number of days and in those who had time to absolute lymphocyte count \u0443500/l faster than median number of days. liferation started to recover quickly after alloBSCT, a finding also reported by Ottinger et al. 11 In the present report post-alloBSCT NK cytotoxicity remained persistently low, despite a high number of circulating CD56 + cells. This sharply contrasts with most alloBMT studies where NK cytotoxicity was one of the first cellular functions to recover. 26, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] The use of G-CSF for mobilization or post-transplant could have modified the dif-ferentiation of regulatory cells resulting in a low level of circulating NK cytotoxicity. 13, 14 G-CSF effects could also be accountable for observed differences in NK and LAK cytotoxicity between mobilized cells and normal donor controls. IL-2-responsive cells that can generate LAK cytotoxicity were present in the circulation early after alloBSCT, similar to published results after alloBMT. 36, 39, 40 Some studies have suggested the ominous predictive value of an early drop in lymphocyte counts after alloBMT. 33, 41, 42 In the present analysis, there was no correlation between the rate of lymphocyte recovery and survival after alloBMT. In contrast, a strong positive correlation between earlier lymphocyte recovery and overall survival was observed after alloBSCT. The exact reason for this association is not clear. Impaired lymphocyte recovery did not correlate with onset or severity of acute GVHD. The main causes of death among alloBSCT patients with slower lymphocyte reconstitution were infections or transplantrelated toxicity. Systemic inflammation that occurs after increased regimen-induced toxicity is usually followed by a compensatory cytokine-mediated anti-inflammatory response that causes immunosuppression and susceptibility to infections. 43, 44 In the alloBSCT setting, lymphocyte recovery occurs 3-4 weeks earlier than after BMT, during a period when the effects of compensatory immunosuppressive response may still be present. In this scenario, slower lymphocyte recovery after alloBSCT could be a surrogate marker for higher regimen-related toxicity. 45 Finally, faster lymphocyte recovery may be a sign of more rapid immunological reconstitution, resulting in fewer infections, and fewer deaths. 11 The duration of this study was not sufficient to allow an evaluation of the impact that chronic GVHD might have on immunological reconstitution in alloBSCT patients. 46 Our results must be interpreted relative to the particular clinical protocol used, and confirmatory studies are needed. If the time to lymphocyte recovery is an independent prognostic factor for survival after alloBSCT, stimulating post-transplant lymphopoiesis could improve patient outcome. 47 The data presented here suggest that after alloBSCT, recovery of lymphocytes and certain lymphocyte functions occur early, and that alloBSCT patients with faster lymphocyte recovery may have better short-term survival. More detailed knowledge of alloBSCT biology, as well as prospective randomized clinical studies are needed to identify critical components of the allograft and the immune system that may determine outcome after alloBSCT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 173, "end": 176, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 618, "end": 622, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 623, "end": 627,
