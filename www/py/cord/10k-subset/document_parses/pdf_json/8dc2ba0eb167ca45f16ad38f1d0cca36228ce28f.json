There are many factors including pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity that are known to contribute to the ability of viruses to persist in water. Equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) is a pathogenic alphaherpesvirus associated with domestic horses and wild equids. EHV-1 and recombinants of EHV-1 and EHV-9 are able to cause infections in non-equid animal species, particularly in captive settings. Many of the captive non-equid mammals are not naturally sympatric with equids and do not share enclosures, however, in many cases water sources may overlap. Similarly, in the wild, equids encounter many species at waterholes in times of seasonal drought. Therefore, we hypothesized that EHV-1 is stable in water and that water may act as a vector for EHV-1. In order to establish the conditions promoting or hindering EHV-1 longevity, infectivity and genomic stability in water; we exposed EHV-1 to varied water environments (pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity) in controlled experiments over 21 days. The presence and infectivity of the virus was confirmed by both qPCR and cell culture experiments.

Serological and genetic evidence suggests that zebra-conspecific and rhinos in Africa are frequently exposed to EHV-1 and its close relative EHV-9, which may even reservoir in rhinos (Abdelgawad et al. 2015) . It is evident that cross species transmission of EHV-1-like viruses occurs in both captive and wild animals; however, the mechanism by which virus is transmitted is yet to be determined. As most captive animals do not have direct contact with equine species, it is most likely that viral transmission is indirect. Water bodies are a common feature of many zoos and in the environment and are often shared by many species. In the wild, many equid species and sympatric species live under conditions of seasonal water shortages forcing mass congregations of animals at residual water sources. Therefore, it is possible that water may act as an environmental vector mediating the transmission of EHV-1 in both captive and wild animal populations.

However, due to the relatively high viral titer necessary for the current experiments, we were unable to draw an accurate link between GCN and plaque forming units (PFUs). The result of EHV-1 being stable and resistant under high pH conditions has been previously shown for other human pathogens, such as norovirus 24 , which is able to survive high pH ranges despite not having an envelope. The enveloped avian influenza was also reported to be more stable in slightly basic conditions (pH 7.4-8.2) 14 . In contrast, herpes simplex virus (HSV) only remains infectious for 4.5 hours under high pH conditions 25 . For equid species these results could suggest transmission of EHV-1 in water would be more likely to occur in alkaline water sources that are accessed by many different individuals, increasing the likelihood that a higher titre of virus particles are maintained in the water. This suggests there are strong differences among herpesviruses in their ability to remain infectious in water with varying pH levels. However, a dilution experiment of a gammaherpesvirus (EHV-2) in distilled and tap water yielded results similar to those observed for EHV-1 (data not shown). This suggests that EHVs may have similar stability in water but that this propensity may not extend to all herpesviruses. From the results, we can speculate that alkaline water sources, often found in places such as Mongolia, China, and Africa [26] [27] [28] [29] , would be best suited to serve as sources of transmission for EHVs. Of note, all three countries have wild equid species (Equus hemionus hemionus or Mongolian wild asses in Mongolia and three zebra species, E. grevi, E. zebra and E. quagga in Africa). In all three countries, equids and sympatric species are subject to seasonal water shortages and congregate at high density in mixed species assemblages at residual water holes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 525, "end": 527, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 934, "end": 936, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1121, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1229, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2048, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2049, "end": 2053, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2058, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2063, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 314, "text": "(Fig. 1A,B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While there is a trend showing that higher salinity resulted in EHV-1 DNA remaining stable after seven days while lower salinity levels decreased stability over 21 days (Figs 2A and 3A) (Table 1 ) when compared with the positive controls; there were no statistically significant effects of salinity for either qPCR post cell culture or the cell culture results. Therefore, despite the effect on DNA stability, we could not detect a statistically significant effect on infectivity. Although the effect of salinity on herpesviruses has not been previously investigated, studies of avian influenza virus under different salinity conditions in water have demonstrated that they are preferentially stable in fresh to brackish water environments (0-20,000 ppm) 14 . While DNA stability of EHV-1 was highest between 3,000 to 35,000 ppm after seven days, all concentrations negatively impacted the infectivity of EHV-1 Other studies have demonstrated that phosphate-buffered saline solutions enabled the survival of pseudorabies virus for up to ten days, compared to two days in lagoon water 30 . The data overall suggest that a wide range of salt concentrations will have limited impact on EHV infection but that high salinity preserves viral DNA at the expense of viral infectivity. However, the water sources used by both captive and wild equids are unlikely to have salinity levels equivalent to those that inhibit infectivity and thus EHV is likely environmentally stable across a broad range of salt conditions in nature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 755, "end": 757, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1086, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 185, "text": "(Figs 2A and 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 186, "end": 194, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Temperature had a significant effect on the persistence of EHV-1 in water (Fig. 2 Our results suggest that turbidity may influence the stability of EHV-1.

It was surprising to us that EHV-1 DNA degraded more rapidly in the water than in the sediment.

It may be possible that viral envelope glycoproteins interact with charged molecules in the soil and protect the virus hydrolytic degradation.

During the dry seasons, both large mammalian predators and prey are often observed drinking together in close proximity [34] [35] [36] . It is at these water sources that equid species infected with EHV-1 could potentially be shedding virus into the water where it can persist long after the animals have moved on. As this study has demonstrated EHV-1 to be stable under different environmental water conditions, the water sources would provide EHV-1 with the opportunity to infect potential hosts sharing the water source.

Remarkably, EHV-1 could be isolated in cell culture for up to 21 days under all treatment conditions, indicating that EHV-1 is able to remain infectious for extended periods of time and in a wide temperature range of 4-30 \u00b0C(Table 2). This result, however, differed from the original results from the serial dilution experiment, in which only the sample with the highest viral load induced CPE up to 14 days of treatment. We suspected that the difference in outcome may have been a result of inaccurate TCID 50 calculations, which was further confirmed through qPCR results showing an about 4-fold difference between two different viral stocks in these experiments. This result could hint a threshold phenomenon in the sense that a certain amount of infectious virus is necessary for sustained infectivity over longer time scales. Notably, the stability of EHV-1 over an ambient temperature range (4-20 \u00b0C) is similar to the water-borne viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) that remained stable up to 13 days in 15 \u00b0C in freshwater31 . However, EHV-1 is able to remain infectious for over two weeks in water of higher temperatures, whereas VHSV can only remain infectious for two days at 30 \u00b0C.From the results, we surmise that EHV-1 may remain stable and infectious in a range of water sources where temperatures may vary considerably.
