Enteric viral infection has been increasingly recognized as a cause of both endemic and epidemic diarrhoeal disease [8, 9] . Rotavirus, adenovirus and coxsackie virus have been implicated as causative agents of diarrhoea in primary immunode\u00aeciency disease [10] and in immunosuppressed bone marrow recipients [11] . Adenovirus has been reported as a disseminated infection in AIDS and isolated from brain, lung and liver samples. However, the main manifestations of this infection appear to be in the gastrointestinal tract [12] , where this and other enteric viruses can be isolated from the stool and intestinal tissue. Clear consensus about the role of enteric viruses in acute and chronic infection in HIV patients does not exist [13\u00b118] . Few data exist regarding the natural history of these infections and their possible association with other pathogens. Adenovirus infection of colonic tissue has been described [19, 20] , but it is unclear whether`adenovirus colitis' is responsible for symptoms in this group of patients.",

Acute diarrhoea of less than 4 weeks duration' occurred in 34/ 52 (65%) of cases overall while chronic diarrhoea occurred in the remaining 18/52 (35%) cases. Those patients with concurrent gut pathogens were more likely to have chronic diarrhoea: 14/18 (78%) of those with chronic diarrhoea were positiveforgutpathogenscomparedto9/34(26%)oftheacute diarrhoea group (P = 0.004, 95% odds ratio (OR) 2.9 [1, 2, 4, 7] ). The co-pathogens present were cryptosporidia (n = 7), microsporidia (n = 8), other protozoa (n = 7), CMV upper gut (n = 3), CMV colitis (n = 2) and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) of the gut (n = 2). None of the patients had cultures positive for bacterial pathogens. After exclusion of concurrent gut pathogens 25/29 (86%) patients had acute diarrhoea (11 adenovirus, \u00aeve coronavirus, \u00aeve rotavirus and four SRSV). Values for CD4 count and HIV duration given as median (range). *P = 0.0007. [19, 20] . Table 2 illustrates the characteristics of these two patient groups. There were no signi\u00aecant differences in age, median CD4 counts, frequency of concurrent gut pathogens, AIDS diagnoses, antiviral or antiretroviral use between the groups. Fourteen of 23 (61%) cases in whom adenovirus was identi\u00aeed only in the stool had acute symptoms compared with 6/21 (29%) of individuals with histological evidence of colorectal adenovirus infection, the remainder having chronic diarrhoea (P = 0.03). This relationship persisted after strati\u00aecation for presence of concurrent gut pathogens. Thus, patients in whom virus was isolated from the stool alone had an increased frequency of acute diarrhoea while patients in whom histological evidence of adenovirus infection was found were more likely to have chronic diarrhoea (OR; adenovirus colitis for acute diarrhoea 0.14 (95% CI 0.03\u00b10.72)). Repeat rectal biopsies were performed on 10 patients with histological evidence of colorectal adenovirus infection at a mean of 21 weeks after the original biopsy. In \u00aeve cases there was evidence of persistent adenovirus infection; 13/20 duodenal biopsies performed at the same time as the de\u00aenitive rectal biopsy were normal and no histological evidence of adenovirus infection was found in any of the duodenal specimens.",

These differences may be explained by geographical variations, discrepancies in detection rates between various methods and population sizes studied. The overall prevalence of enteric viruses in this study (15.9%) is similar to that of Schmidt et al. [18] , who found an overall prevalence of 17% (6.6% adenovirus) using electron microscopy in a similar cohort of patients. Reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques are becoming available for the detection of some enteric viruses and are likely to be more sensitive than the electron microscopic techniques employed in this study. True prevalence rates may therefore be higher than those determined in this study.",

Using a previously validated investigative protocol to identify co-infection with known pathogens [21] we found that 25/29 (86%) of unselected HIV patients with enteric virus infection had associated acute diarrhoeal episodes (less than 4 weeks' L duration). In contrast, the presence of a concurrent gut pathogen known to cause diarrhoeal symptoms in the immunosuppressed was associated with chronic diarrhoea (P = 0.004). Data on viral carriage in asymptomatic patients in our study population are not available and we cannot therefore be certain of a causal role of these viruses in HIVrelated diarrhoea. We also have reservations about the accuracy of analysis of formed stool. However, the strong association between acute diarrhoea and the presence of enteric viruses without evidence of other pathogens suggests this association. Three previous studies have suggested an association between enteric viral carriage and diarrhoea [13, 14, 18] . In other studies no association has been found [16, 19, 22] , which may be explained in part by their focus on chronic diarrhoea as opposed to acute diarrhoea. Establishing a pathogenic role for enteric viruses in HIV-related diarrhoea is likely to remain dif\u00aecult, in view of the occurrence of asymptomatic shedding of virus and the high rate of concurrent enteric pathogens in this group of patients, particularly those with chronic diarrhoea.",

This condition has been termed`adenovirus colitis' and is poorly understood, with published material limited to case reports [19, 20] . The clinical signi\u00aecance of adenovirus colitis has not been established. We therefore compared cases of adenovirus colitis identi\u00aeed from histological records with those in whom adenovirus was identi\u00aeed in stool. Cases were matched for CD4 counts, antiviral therapy and the presence of concurrent gut pathogens. In the adenovirus/ stool group 14/23 patients had acute diarrhoea compared to 6/21 in the adenovirus colitis group (P = 0.03). There is a potential bias towards a rectal biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhoea and hence a diagnosis of adenovirus colitis. These results suggest that a proportion of patients develop overt mucosal in\u00afammation in association with adenovirus infection and may go on to develop chronic diarrhoea. Further work is required to characterize adenovirus isolates from patients with adenovirus colitis. Subgenus F serotype 40 adenovirus has been associated with symptomatic gastrointestinal infection, and data from a seroprevalence study suggest the recently proposed adenovirus serotypes 48 and 49 may be endemic among gay men and sexual transmission is the likely source of exposure [24, 25] .",

Adenovirus infection has previously been associated with increased frequency of co-infections [18] and a facilitator role for the virus has been suggested [26] . We postulate that the cytopathic damage to the colonic epithelium caused by adenovirus, which may be extensive, may predispose to CMV infection. Additionally, adenovirus protein products have been shown to prevent killing by cytotoxic T cells, perhaps further inhibiting viral clearance [27] .
