            "text": "This paper describes a new fully differentiated Type-II alveolar epithelial cell line designated TT, derived from transgenic H-2Kh-tsA58 mice, capable of being passaged as an immortalized cloned cell line in culture. H-2Kb-tsA58 mice harbor a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T antigen) under the control of the ~-interferon (INF)-inducible mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2K b promoter. When cultured under permissive conditions (33 ~ C and in the presence of ~/-INF) ceils isolated from H-2Kb-tsA58 mice express the large T antigen, which drives the ceils to proliferate. However, upon withdrawal of the \"v-INF and transfer of the cells to a higher temperature (39 ~ C), T antigen expression is turned off, the cells stop proliferating and differentiate. The T 7 cell line is a clonal cell line originally derived from a Type-II cell-rich fraction isolated from lungs of H-2K~-tsA58 mice. The T 7 ceils form confluent monolayers, and have a polarized epithelial cell morphology with tight junctions and apical microvilli. In addition, the T 7 ceils have distinct cytoplasmic lamellar bodies, which become more numerous and pronounced when the cells are grown under nonpermissive conditions. The T 7 cells synthesize and secrete phosphatidylcholine and the three surfactant proteins, SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C. The T7 cell line is unique in that it is the first non-tumor-derived Type-I! cell line capable of synthesizing and secreting the major components of surfactant. Based on the criteria studied, the T 7 cell line is phenotypically very similar to normal Type-II cells. The T7 cell line, therefore, should prove a valuable experimental system to advance the study of the cell biology/physiology of surfactant metabolism and secretion as well as serve as a model for other studies of Type-II cell physiology.",

Surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and three proteins called surfactant protein A (SP-A), B (SP-B), and C (SP-C) (Weaver and Whitsett, 1991) . The surfactant complex reduces surface tension at the airliquid interface in the alveolus, which prevents alveolar collapse during expiration. When the surfactant is absent or is deficient, as in premature infants or in certain pathological states in adults, respiratory distress ensues (Avery and Mead, 1959; Hartog et al., 1995) .",

One can isolate and culture primary Type-II cells; however, this eventually results in the loss of differentiated characteristics, including production of phospholipids and surfactant proteins (Dobbs, 1990; Leslie et al., 1993) . Several Type-II cell lines have been derived from animals and human tissue (Smith, 1977; O'Reilly et al., 1988a; Mallampalli et al., 1992;  l To whom correspondence should be addressed at E-mail: demellde@slu.edu Steele et al., 1992; Wikenheiser et al., 1993; Sen et al., 1994) , but generally these have originated from tumors and most do not manifest sustained secretion of lamellar bodies, phospholipids, or the surfactant proteins. None of these cell lines are phenotypically close to Type-II ceils. Moreover because of their transformed origin, it is uncertain whether these cell lines accurately reflect the cell biology/ physiology of normal Type-II cells.",

However, using the transgenic H-2Kb-tsA58 (Immorto) mouse (Jar et al., 1991) , several groups have recently generated differentiated immortal cell lines from epithelial tissues, such as colonic and small bowel epithelium (Whitehead et al., 1993) , and bone (osteoclasts) (Chambers et al., 1993) . These cell types had hitherto proved difficult, if not impossible, to culture. The transgenic H-2K-tsA58 (Immorto) mouse has inserted into its genome a construct consisting of the 5' flanking promoter sequence and the transcriptional initiation site of the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2K b class I (MHC) gene coupled to the coding sequence of a temperature-sensitive form of the simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen (Jat et al., 1991) . The MHC gene promoter is not only widely active in a range of tissues but is also susceptible to additional induction by interferons. When ceils from the Immorto mouse are isolated and grown under permissive conditions (33 ~ C and with 3,-interferon [~/-INF] present in the media) the SV40 T antigen is expressed causing the cells to proliferate. However, upon withdrawal of the ~/-INF and transfer of the cells to a higher temperature (39 ~ C), T antigen expression is turned off, the cells stop dividing, and, they proceed to differentiate.",

            "text": "A modification of the technique described by Mason et al. (1997b) was used to isolate Type-II cells from the hnnmrto transgenic mouse lungs (Jat et al., 1991) . In preliminary experiments on the parent nontransgenic strain CBA/Ca \u2022 C57BL, it was determined that a minimum of four mouse lungs were necessary to obtain a visible cell pellet. Consequently four hnmorto mice were anesthetized and heparinized. The trachea was cannulated and the aorta transected to exsanguinate the mice while ventilation was maintained. The lungs were perfused through the pulmonary artery with a dextrose/salt solution until they appeared white and blood-free. The dextrose/sah solution was then used to lavage the lungs seven times, followed by lavage twice with a dextrose/sah solution plus 1.9 mM calcium chloride (CaCI~) and 1.2 mM magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). A 20-rain incubation at 37 ~ C followed, while the trachea was filled with the latter solution plus elastase. The airways and nonparenchymal tissues were dissected away and the rest of the lung placed in a deoxyribonuclease solution and minced into 1-mm cubes. Elastase activity was stopped with the addition of fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was fihered through Teflon meshes of 100 and 20 t~m, underlaid with fetal bovine serum and centrifuged at 130 \u2022 g for 8 min. The lighter Type-II cells remain in the supernate. The supernate was again centrifuged to obtain a cell-rich pellet. To remove contaminating macrophages this pellet was resuspended in serum-free medium, placed on IgG-coated dishes and incubated for 1 h at 37 ~ C. The supernate from the IgG-coated dishes was then centrifuged at 130 \u2022 g for 8 min. The Type-II cell-rich pellets were resuspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing: fetal bovine serum, 2%; penicillin, 100 U/ml; streptomycin, 1%; amphotericin B, 250 Ixg/ml; \",/-INF, 100 U/ml; transferrin, 5 txg/ml; epidermal growth factor, 0.025 p~g/ml; insulin, 10 txg/ml; endothelial cell growth supplement, 7.5 Ixg/ml; endothelin-1, 40 nmol/ml; T3, 20 ng/ml; hydrocortisone, 0.36 Ixg/ml. These additives were selected because they are known to promote Type-II cell differentiation (Kresch et ah, 1987; Massey et al., 1987; Van Scott et al., 1988; Mason et al., 1990; Sen et al., 1994) . The cells were then plated on tissue culture plastic in low volume to promote cell adherence. Cells were incubated overnight in 10% CO2 at 33 ~ C, the permissive temperature, which promotes cell proliferation. The cells grew rapidly to confluence on tissue culture plastic, and after trypsinization were split and replated. Ceils were passaged eight times and then clonal cell lines were derived by limiting dilution cloning (Freshney, 1991) . Cells grown at the time of cloning were designated as passage 1.",

After placing 3 ml of the collagen stock solution on 30-ram Millicell CM membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the collagen was allowed to polymerize for 2 h at 37 ~ FIG. 1. RT-PCR was done on total RNA extracted by cesium chloride gradient from the T7 clone. Lane ! is a negative control (without RNA) and represents no PCR product of the RT-PCR reaction without RNA. Lane 2 represents the PCR product resulting from the inclusion of RNA from T7 cells grown on tissue culture plastic at 33 ~ C in the presence of ~,-INF for --5 d and then transferred to 39 ~ C for 3 d without \"/-INE In lane 3, RNA from T 7 cells grown to confluence on tissue culture plastic at 33 ~ C in the presence of ~/-INF was used. In lanes 4 and 5, RNA from mouse kidney or lung representing negative and positive tissue controls, respectively, was included in the PCR mixture. The amount of RNA used in each lane was standardized by optical density taken at 260 nm. In panel A, the expected 346 bp SP-A cDNA fragment was amplified from RNA from the T 7 clone and from mouse lung. No SP-A cDNA amplification is seen in the negative lanes 1 or 4. In panel B the expected SP-B eDNA 260-bp fragment is seen in the T7 lanes 2 and 3 and in lane 5, the positive control, but not in the negative control lanes 1 and 4. In panel C the expected SP-C cDNA 251-bp fragment is seen in the T~ lanes 2 and 3 and in the positive control lane 5, but not in the negative control lanes 1 and 4. In all three panels an expected higher molecular weight DNA band was observed in lanes 2-4 reflecting contamination of RNA with genomic DNA and in lane 4 serves to show successful amplification in this negative control. Using primers for mouse 13-actin cDNA, an expected 500-bp fragment was detected in cells corresponding to lanes 2-5 (data not shown).",

Electrical measurements to determine transepithelial resistance were performed on cells plated on collagen-coated transwells that had achieved confluence. The Millicell ERS vohmeter (Millipore) was used, and first, the resistance was measured in a 'blank', i.e., across a transwell membrane with no cells but with the same volume of medium in the top and bottom wells. The resistance was then measured across a confluent monolayer of cells grown on a transwell membrane. The difference between the readings in the blank and the cell sample was taken as the transepithelial resistance. In addition, the impermeability of the confluent monolayer was demonstrated using tritiated inulin. After the addition of inulin (650 txCi/ml) to the medium in the top well, the transwells were incubated for 1 h before aliquots of medium present in the apical and basal wells were taken. The amount of inulin present in each aliquot of medium was then determined by liquid scintillation counting.",

To accomplish this, we screened, by Western blot analysis, T7 cell lysates for SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C proteins (Fig. 2) . For these studies, mouse lung homogenates and a lmnellar body preparation were used as positive controls, In addition, the antibodies used were fully characterized (see Methods section) and are monospecifie for their designated antigen, The T7 cell lysates yielded a single 26-30 kDa band with the SP-A antiserum (Phelps et al., 1984) , This band represents the mature fully processed form of SP-A. A band of similar size was observed as the mature SP-Aprotein in both the mouse lung and lamellar body preparations (data not shown). Both lung and lamellar body preparations revealed several larger molecular weight forms of SP-A as previously published (Phelps et al., 1984) . In comparison, with antiserum to SP-B (Suzuki et al,, 1986) , the T7 cell lysate yielded a doublet at 42-44 kDa and a diffuse single band at 8-10 kDa, The doublet is the unprocessed pro-form of SP-B, while the 8-10 kDa band represents the mature fully processed SP-B peptide. In the SP-B blots a minor band was also observed at 28-29 kDa, this possibly is the carboxy-terminus of the pro-protein liberated by the first proteolytic cleavage of the unprocessed SP-B protein. All four of these SP-B protein bands were observed with this primary antibody in the mouse lung preparation (data not shown). Finally, with the SP-C antiserum, the T 7 cell lysates yielded a doublet at 46-50 kDa and a very prominent band at 6~ kDa. Both the mouse lung homogenate and lame!lar body positive controls yielded a similar pattern of SP-C proteins (data not shown) as previously described (Beers et al, 1994) , The 46-50 kDa band represents a multimer resistant to SDS dissociation that develops in vitro after boiling because of the extreme hydrophobicity of SP-C. A similar band was also detected by Beers et al (1994) and immunoreactivity for this product was diminated by competition with purified SP-C (Beers et al., 1994) . The 6-8 kDa band represents a partially processed form of SP-C. Increased pro- junctions (short arrow) and contain cytoplasmic lamellar bodies (thin arrows), and basal lipid droplets (thick arrows, original magnification rein expression was seen in cells grown under nonpermissive conditions when a dose of 50 txg/ml of 7-INF was used to stimulate proliferation, and remained unchanged in cells grown under permissive or nonpermissive conditions and over several cell passages (5 'h through 85 'h, the latter being the last passage studied).",

The media was then removed, concentrated, and screened, by Western blot analysis, for SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C (Fig. 4) . The T 7 cells secreted all three surfactant proteins. The secreted form of SP-A appeared to have a higher molecular weight than that present in the lysates. This increase in size most likely reflects asparagine-linked glycosylation of the mature polypeptide (Weaver and Whitsett, 1991) . In addition to mature fully processed SP-B, the cells also secreted approximately five other immunologically related proteins, ranging in molecular weight from 45--16 kDa, that were recognized by the SP-B antibody. These additional bands probably represent the processing intermediates. For example, the 45 kDa protein is probably unprocessed pro-SP-B, while the 30-32 kDa protein is the clipped carboxy-terminus of the pro-protein. The T7 cells predominantly secrete the 6-8 kDa partially processed form of SP-C. Cell growth under nonpermissive conditions did not alter secretion of SP-A or SP-B, but for SP-C, a minor band, the 3-5 kDa peptide appeared. This small molecular weight band may represent additional processing of SP-C, although the SP-C antibody used does not recognize the mature form of SP-C resulting from cleavage at the aminoterminus (M. Beers, pers. comm.).",

New primary culture methodologies have been developed; however, even with these, Type-II cells can only be kept differentiated and viable for 2-4 wk. Thereafter, the cells reach senescence and apoptose.

The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and reduced to one-third the volume in a speed vacuum centrifuge. The concentrated medium was then electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE and blotted. The blot was cut into three strips and each strip was probed with antibody to SP-A, SP-B, or SP-C as described above. A 26-35-kD band was seen with the antibody to SP-A. Translational products of SP-B including 42-44-kD and 16-kD bands were seen with the antibody to SP-B. In addition, the mature 8 kD SP-B peptide was present, indicating complete processing of SP-B by this cell line.

In addition, cells grown under nonpermissivc conditions showed additional processing of SP-C to a 3-5-kD peptide (arrow). but forms nonadhercnt cultures and so is not appropriate for studies examining secretory polarity. Furthermore, these cells are difficult to grow (Steele et al., 1992) .

The H441 cell line synthesizes only SP-A and SP-B, but not SP-C, so it is not clear that it really represents a Type-II cell line, as SP-C is considered a marker for Type-lI cells (O'Reilly et al., 1988a (O'Reilly et al., , 1988b . Recently, distal respiratory epithelial cell lines from tumors generated in transgenic mice harboring the viral oncogene SV40 large tumor antigen under the transcriptional control of a promoter region from the human SP-C gene, have been developed (Wikenheiser et al., 1993) . Of the several cell lines reported, the MLE-7 cell line reportedly manifests some morphologic features of Type-II cells and expression of SP-A, SP-B and SP-C. Since these lines were derived from lung tumors, aberrant development is a concern and these cell lines may not accurately reflect the cell biology of normal Type-II cells.",

The Immorto mouse harbors within its genome a transgene consisting of the 5' flanking promoter sequence and the transcriptional initiation site of the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2K b class I (MHC) gene fused to the coding sequence of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 T antigen (SV40tsA58). The MHC gene is active in the majority of ceils and is also susceptible to additional induction by interferons. Thus, when ceils from the Immorto mouse are isolated and grown under permissive conditions (33 ~ C and with y-INF present in the media), the SV40 T antigen is expressed; this drives the ceils to proliferate. However, upon withdrawal of the interferon and transfer of the cells to a higher temperature (39 ~ C), T antigen expression is turned off and the cells stop proliferating and differentiate. Our studies have shown that differentiation is most pronounced when the dose of ~-INF used for stimulating proliferation at 33 ~ C is 50 ~g/ml. Thus this model overcomes the difficulty of achieving stable integration of an exogenous oncogene into cellular DNA (Clement et al., 1990) . Hence cells from the Immorto mouse can be driven to proliferate or differentiate in culture by turning the T antigen 'switch' on or off, with the addition or withdrawal of y-INF, and by adjusting the temperature of the cultured cells. Because of these unique characteristics, Immorto mice have been successfully used to generate immortal cell lines of tissues that have hitherto proved difficult to culture such as colonic and small bowel epithelium (Whitehead et al., 1993) and bone (osteoclasts) (Chambers ct al., 1993) .",

Morphologically, the T; cells closely resemble native Type-II cells. Specifically, the T7 cells arc polarized with distinct cytoplasmic lamellar bodies. The number and size of the lamellar bodies did appear to increase when the T~ cells were grown under nonpermisssive conditions. In addition, there was an apparent increase in the nmnber of lamellar bodies in the cells grown under nonpermissive conditions that were exposed to fresh media 4---6 h prior to harvesting. This observation suggests that the culture medium contains limiting quantities of the components required by the cells to produce lamellar bodies. The T 7 cells were also shown to synthesize SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and phosphatidyleholine, the four major components of pulmonary suffactant.",

The % cells demonstrate differentiated secretion of surfactant proteins and phospholipids at both 33 and 39 ~ C. While the number of lamellar bodies increase at the nonpermissive temperature, the amounts of surfactant proteins exhibited by Western blot appear comparable. The most significant observed difference in the % cell line at 39 o C is the progressive loss of cell proliferation and eventual cell death, which do not occur at 33 ~ C. Thus this line is the first, non-tumor-derived, immortalized and clonal Type-II cell line that appears to be able to differentiate and is capable of synthesizing and secreting surfactant. Unlike previously described tuntor-derived Type-II cell lines, the T7 cell line does not appear to have lost any Type-II cell specific biochemical or morphological features, and unlike primary Type-II cell cultures, T 7 cells can be maintained indefinitely in cell culture and clonally expanded with ease.",

            "text": "The unique Type-II cell line T7 synthesizes both surfactant lipids and the proteins SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C. The lipids and all three surfactant proteins play an important role in the assembly of the surface-active lipoprotein complex, the lantellar body, and/or its extrusion from the cell. Recent ultrastructural and immunohistologic observations in the lungs of SP-B-deficient children and transgenic mice suggest that SP-B plays an important role in the assembly of the lantellar body, its intracellular trafficking, and in the metabolism of the surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-C (Nogee et al., 1993; deMello et al., 1994a deMello et al., , 1994b Clark et al., 1995) . Now, with the availability of a normal (non-tumor-derived) and clonal cell line that produces both surfactant lipids and proteins, these molecular mechanisms can be more clearly defined. The insight into Type-Ii cell biology that these studies will provide, could have a significant impact on the management of respiratory disorders that result from Type-II cell dysfunction, such as the adult and infantile respiratory distress syndromes.",
