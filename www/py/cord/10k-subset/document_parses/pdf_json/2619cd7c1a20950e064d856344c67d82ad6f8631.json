            "text": "Background: A subanalysis of a randomized clinical trial indicated sepsis survival benefit from interleukin (IL)-1 blockade in patients with features of the macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS). This study aimed to investigate the frequency of MALS and to develop a biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis. Methods: Patients with infections and systemic inflammatory response syndrome were assigned to one test cohort (n = 3417) and a validation cohort (n = 1704). MALS was diagnosed for patients scoring positive either for the hemophagocytic syndrome score and/or having both hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the predictive value of MALS for 10-day mortality in both cohorts. Ferritin, sCD163, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were measured in the blood the first 24 h; ferritin measurements were repeated in 747 patients on day 3. Results: The frequency of MALS was 3.7% and 4.3% in the test and the validation cohort, respectively. In both cohorts, MALS was an independent risk factor for 10-day mortality. A ferritin level above 4420 ng/ml was accompanied by 66.7% and 66% mortality after 28 days, respectively. Ferritin levels above 4420 ng/ml were associated with an increase of IL-6, IL-18, INF-\u03b3, and sCD163 and a decreased IL-10/TNF-\u03b1 ratio, indicating predominance of pro-inflammatory phenomena. Any less than 15% decrease of ferritin on day 3 was associated with more than 90% sensitivity for unfavorable outcome after 10 days. This high mortality risk was also validated in an independent Swedish cohort (n = 109). Conclusions: MALS is an independent life-threatening entity in sepsis. Ferritin measurements can provide early diagnosis of MALS and may allow for specific treatment.",

            "text": "Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection [1] . This definition, suggested a year ago, underlined the role of the host immune response for clinical outcome [1] and challenged the old definition of sepsis as the presence of infection with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [2] . Our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of sepsis suggests that some patients present with hyperinflammation, some present with immunosupression, and the rest lie somewhere between these two extremes [3] . It is highly plausible that some of the clinical trials conducted between 1994 and 2004 testing diverse strategies of immune intervention failed just because there was no attempt to stratify patients based on the state of immune activation. One of these randomized phase III trials tested the efficacy of anakinra in severe sepsis. Anakinra is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of the human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist. Although anakinra did not provide survival benefit for the entire population [4] , a subanalysis by Shakoory et al. was recently published focusing on patients with hyper-inflammation [5] . The co-presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hepatobiliary dysfunction (HBD) was used as an indicator of the predominance of pro-inflammatory phenomena, and this was found in 43 of the 906 patients. Of these 43 patients, 17 were treated with placebo and 26 with anakinra; mortality after 28 days was 65% and 35%, respectively (p = 0.0006).",

MAS is also known as hemophagocytotic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [6] . It is a life-threatening condition of pancytopenia, tissue hemophagocytosis, and early progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death within 10 days [6] . The hallmark of pathogenesis relies on the hyperactivation of tissue macrophages, leading to excessive production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and ferritin [7] . Since MAS can also be secondary to malignancies and other autoimmune disorders, a number of criteria have been developed to identify these cases [8, 9] . Presence of bone marrow hemophagocytosis is one of the criteria taken into consideration for the diagnosis of MAS [6, 8, 9] . Since this criterion was investigated neither by Shakoory et al. [5] nor by us in the current study due to the difficulty of performance in every critically ill patient, we prefer to call this entity macrophage activation-like syndrome (MALS). The incidence of MALS in sepsis has never been studied thus far.",

However, we developed a classification system that could provide equivalent criteria for classification. This is the reason why we classified patients as having MALS and not MAS. More precisely, MALS was diagnosed in every patient who either met the HScore 2014 suggested for adults suffering from autoimmune diseases [15] and/or had both DIC and HBD, as suggested by Shakoory et al. [5] . The HScore, suggested for the diagnosis of hemophagocytosis syndrome (HS), provides specific points for the following variables: immunodeficiency (defined as infection by HIV and/or long-term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, glucocorticoids, and azathioprine; up to 18 points), body temperature (up to 49 points), organomegaly (up to 38 points), cytopenias (up to 34 points), serum ferritin (up to 50 points), triglycerides (up to 64 points), fibrinogen (up to 30 points), aspartate aminotransferase (up to 19 points), and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow (up to 35 points). The final score varies between 0 and 337 points, so that scores higher than 169 are associated with 90% sensitivity for HS. In the current study, the HScore could range between 0 and 302, since bone marrow aspiration providing 35 points (i.e., 10.4% of the maximal points) was not done routinely in our patients. Taking into consideration that in the original HScore the cutoff value of 169 represented the median of the HScore, it seemed logical to use the median of 151 as the new cutoff value. As a consequence, this modification comprising eight criteria could not be the same as the original HScore, which uses nine criteria. However, it was anticipated to be equivalent to the original HScore. Moreover, we tried to adjust for this limitation in a conservative approach: patients presenting with both HBD and DIC as suggested by Shakoory et al. [5] were also classified as having MALS. HBD was defined by the presence of at least two of the following: (1) serum bilirubin higher than 2.5 mg/dl, (2) aspartate aminotransferase at least two times higher than the upper normal limit, and (3) INR higher than 1.5. DIC was not defined using the definition applied in the manuscript by Shakoory et al. [5] . Instead, in order to achieve better diagnostic sensitivity for DIC, the DIC Score of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) was used, providing points for the absolute platelet count (maximum 2 points), elevated fibrin-related markers (maximum 3 points), prolonged prothrombin time (maximum 2 points), and fibrinogen level (maximum 1 point). Patients with scores more than or equal to 5 were considered to have overt DIC [16] . All enrolled patients were reclassified into infection and sepsis categories using the new Sepsis-3 definition [17] . Those classified as having sepsis by the new classification and who scored positive for HS and/or HBD/DIC were diagnosed with MALS.",

In the test cohort, 10-day mortality with ferritin above 4420 ng/ml was 44.8% (35.2-54.8%); this value did not differ significantly from that of the validation cohort, where 10-day mortality was 45.2% (36.4-54.3%, p = 1.000) (Fig. 4a) . The OR for death after 28 days when ferritin was above 4420 ng/ml was 4.07 (95% CI 2.64-6.28) in the test cohort and 3.75 (95% CI 2.10-6.72) in the validation cohort. The ORs did not differ as the p value of comparison was 0.827. Survival analysis of the test and validation Greek cohorts and of the Swedish validation cohort ended with considerably higher 28-day mortality among patients with ferritin greater than 4420 ng/ml (Fig. 4b-d) . From the analysis above, we suggest a serum ferritin level above 4420 ng/ml as a potential diagnostic biomarker for MALS. To ensure clinical relevance, such a biomarker for MALS should correlate to hyperinflammation as well as prognosticate early unfavorable outcome within 10 days. To this end, analysis was performed in patients from both cohorts. IL-6, IL-18, IFN\u03b3, and sCD163 serum levels were higher and the ratio of serum IL-10/TNF-\u03b1 was lower for patients with serum ferritin above 4420 ng/ml compared to patients with ferritin \u2264 4420 ng/ml, thus supporting a correlation between elevated ferritin and a pro-inflammatory state (Fig. 5) . Positive correlations were found between serum ferritin and serum IL-6 (r s = +0.178, p = 2.3 \u00d7 10 -5 ), between serum ferritin and IL-18 (r s = +0.267, p = 5.3 \u00d7 10 -16 ), between serum ferritin and IFN-\u03b3 (r s = +0.250, p = 3.0 \u00d7 10 -6 ), and between serum ferritin and sCD163 (r s = +0.340, p = 3.0 -\u00d7 10 -6 ). In 35 patients with MALS, repeat serum ferritin after 48 h was available. Patients who were alive on day 10 demonstrated a significant decrease of serum ferritin, but this was not the case for the non-survivors (Fig. 6a) . Similar kinetics of ferritin was not found for patients without MALS (Fig. 6b) . ROC curve analysis conducted among patients with MALS showed that changes of ferritin on day 3 were associated with death by day 10. More precisely, coordinate points of the ROC curve showed that any decrease of serum ferritin by day 3 less than 15% predicted early death after 10 days with sensitivity more than 90% (Fig. 6c) . Also, the OR for early death was significantly lower for patients with less than 15% decrease of serum ferritin during the first 48 h (Fig. 6d ).",

Our results came from a large-scale test cohort of patients with sepsis and were validated in two cohorts, a Greek and a Swedish one. Our study shows that ferritin serves as a reliable biomarker to exclude MALS, and that levels 4420 ng/ml or above are associated with a diagnostic specificity higher than 97%.

Although many experts recommend that bone marrow aspiration may be a helpful diagnostic tool [15] , the use of this technique is not feasible in daily critical care practice. This limitation is fully recognized in pediatric populations [9, 19] .

On the other side, the aspects of HS, e.g., triglycerides or bone marrow aspiration, are not always available in due course and therefore lead to delay of MALS diagnosis. Such a delay is not acceptable in sepsis, where rapid resuscitation is mandatory. Thus, there is a need for a biomarker for rapid diagnosis, which may be used for personalized care.

Although these four conditions are clinically different, they share common features of pathobiology. The term hyperferritinemic syndrome is used because it is suggested that ferritin is not only an expression of hyper-inflammation but also plays a role in enhancing the activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), contributing to further IL-1\u03b2 production and perpetuation of the inflammation [21] .",

IL-18, like IL-1\u03b2, is synthesized as an inactive pro-peptide in macrophages and dendritic cells which is cleaved by activated caspase-1 into its active moiety. Unlike IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 is not consumed through autocrine binding to the cell membrane receptor; hence, high circulating IL-18 is considered an index of elevated production of IL-1\u03b2. IL-18 itself enhances the production of IFN-\u03b3, which in turn drives hemophagocytosis, i.e., the hallmark of MAS [22] . Consequently, the increased circulating IL-18 and IFN-\u03b3 among patients scoring positive for MALS is likely a direct reflection of the pathobiology. Both cytokines were elevated among our patients with hyperferritinemia further supporting the idea that ferritin levels higher than 4420 ng/ml were an indicator of MALS. The IL-10/TNF-\u03b1 ratio, which is a marker of the balance between anti-inflammatory and hyperinflammatory states in sepsis [23] , was assessed. Usually a low ratio is compatible with hyper-inflammation. Our analysis showed that this ratio decreased when ferritin exceeded 4420 ng/ml, which was further supportive of high ferritin as a biomarker of hyper-inflammation. It should, however, be emphasized that, in everyday clinical practice, the expression of the major histocompatibility AUC area under the curve. d 10-day mortality of patients with MALS with more than or less than 15% ferritin decrease between days 1 and 3. p values are provided. CI confidence interval, OR odds ratio complex II HLA-DR molecule on CD14-circulating monocytes by flow cytometry using fresh blood is an easier way than the IL-10/TNF-\u03b1 ratio to assess the drive of anti-inflammation. Expression less than 30% is usually indicative of sepsis-induced immunosuppression [24] .",
