Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases use JAKs and STATs to transduce intracellular signals. Mutations in JAK and STAT genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic Jakinib, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases. Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of clinical trials. This review describes the JAK-STAT pathway, outlines its role in autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting JAK-STAT signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are reviewed, starting with the FDA-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on to next-generation Jakinibs.

The development over the past decade and a half of agents targeting cytokines or their receptors, denoted 'biologics', represents a landmark advancement in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These agents include monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins that target cytokines or cytokine receptors, such as TNF-a, IL-6, and its receptor, IL-1, and others. However, despite the therapeutic success of biologics, it has become evident that targeting a single cytokine does not completely abrogate the pathology of rheumatologic disease for all patients.

The canonical signaling cascade is initiated when type I/II cytokines bind to their cognate receptors (Fig. 2) . Type I/II receptors are composed of distinct chains, which oligomerize upon binding of the cytokine. Oligomerization causes separation of the intracellular subunits of the cytokine receptor, which moves the receptor-associated JAKs apart from each other, relieving constitutive inhibition and resulting in their activation [1, 7, 23, 24] . The JAKs phosphorylate themselves and the intracellular portion of the receptors, which serve as docking sites for STAT transcription factors [25] , which, in turn, are also phosphorylated. When phosphorylated by JAKs, inactive cytosolic STAT monomers undergo a conformational change that allows for the formation of active homodimers, heterodimers, or tetramers.

Different JAK-dependent cytokine receptors signal through different JAKs. Each receptor is composed of multiple subunits, and each subunit associates with a JAK (Fig. 3) . Some receptor chains associate selectively with a specific JAK, whereas some are less selective. Thus, the extent to which a particular type I/II cytokine depends on a specific JAK to transduce signals is determined by the subunits of that cytokine's receptor (Tables 1, 2) . For example, the common c-chain (cc), used by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, associates exclusively with JAK3 and is the only receptor subunit that uses JAK3 [28] . Other functions. An alternative nomenclature for the domains based on their amino acid sequence classifies them as seven Janus homology (JH) domains. b Simplified three-dimensional image of JAK.

Activated STAT dimers form a nutcracker-like structure as shown in this figure. The hinge of the nutcracker is formed by highly conserved SH2 domain and is commonly the target of STAT inhibitors. The linker region and DBD surround centrally located chromatin like the jaws of the nutcracker receptor chains are able to associate with more than one JAK isoform: for instance, the gp130 subunit can use JAK1, JAK2, and possibly TYK2 [16] . A further layer of specificity is conferred by the pairing of specific receptor chains with each other: thus, the cc pairs exclusively with JAK1-associated receptor subunits. Most type I/II cytokine receptors signal through multiple JAKs as a result of this pairing of distinct JAK-associated subunits. JAK2-associated growth factor and hormone-like cytokine receptors are the exception and their subunits have the unique property of self-pairing [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 57, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 677, "end": 681, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1879, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2332, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 229, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 492, "end": 505, "text": "(Tables 1, 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "JAK-STAT Signaling"}, {"text": "There are seven members of the mammalian STAT family: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT6.

However, it is important to recognize a number of additional non-canonical roles for STATs. For example, STATs act not only as homodimers or heterodimers, but also as tetramers [29] . STATs can be phosphorylated by kinases other than JAKs, including Flt3R and pyruvate kinase [29] . In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, STATs undergo serine phosphorylation in response to various external stimuli, which can augment transcriptional responses [30] . Serine phosphorylation also appears to be important for the ability of certain STATs to promote oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [29] . Finally, non-phosphorylated STATs are capable of dimerizing and acting as transcriptional regulators [31, 32] . STATs do not physically associate with a specific cytokine receptor but can be phosphorylated on specific tyrosine and serine residues. This results in a certain degree of functional overlap between STATs.

Hematopoietic growth factors, including erythropoietin and thrombopoietin, signal through JAK2 [25] , thus gain-offunction (GOF) mutations in JAK2 cause hematologic disorders. The most extensively described JAK2 mutation, V617F, causes polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis [34, 35] . Somatic GOF mutations in JAK1 and JAK3 are also associated with hematologic malignancies such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and solid organ malignancies such as breast cancer [36] [37] [38] . JAK1 and JAK2 deficiency phenotypes have not been described in humans, likely because the phenotype is incompatible with life: loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in either JAK is embryonically lethal in mice [39] . LOF TYK2 mutation causes a milder immunodeficiency characterized by susceptibility to viral infection [40, 41] because cells cannot respond to interferon (IFN)-c or IFNa/b [42] . LOF mutations in JAK3 cause autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency, which recapitulates the phenotype observed in patients with mutations in the cc subunit [41, 43] . T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell maturation are profoundly impaired given the importance of cc cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 in their development and B-cell functions are also affected. Patients present with severe recurrent infection, failure to thrive, atopic dermatitis, and chronic diarrhea. At this time, the only definitive treatment for this disease is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because JAK3 is highly expressed in immune cells, patients with autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency are spared from extra-immune disease manifestations. This observation formed the basis for interest in JAK3 blockade as a potential immunosuppressive therapy [5] with limited off-target effects. Binding of cytokine to the receptor leads to activation and phosphorylation of JAK and phosphorylation of the receptor. This in turn leads to phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT. Activated STAT dimer migrates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA-binding sites regulating gene transcription. This culminates in alteration of cellular function STAT1 mutations resulting in either LOF or GOF have been described. Autosomal dominant LOF mutations cause Mendelian predisposition to mycobacterial diseases [33] because responses to IFNc are impaired [44] : the mutation is dominant negative for type II IFN responses. However, signaling downstream of IFNa/b is unaffected because the mutation is autosomal recessive for type I IFN signaling. Therefore, heterozygous patients are not susceptible to viral infection. Complete biallelic STAT1 deficiency, by contrast, is purely autosomal recessive for type I and II IFN signaling. Affected patients therefore exhibit fatal susceptibility to viral disease in addition to mycobacterial infections [45] . GOF STAT1 mutations cause chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis because increased signaling downstream of IFNc inhibits IL-17 production, ultimately causing defective responses to fungal infection. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis patients are also predisposed to autoimmunity, and GOF STAT1 mutations have been reported to cause a number of other autoimmune manifestations [46] . LOF mutation in the STAT2 gene causes increased susceptibility to viral infection and has also been described as a cause of sepsis-like syndrome following immunization with a live viral vaccine [47, 48] . This is consistent with the role of STAT2 in signaling downstream of type I IFNs, which are critical for immune responses to virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 210, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 513, "end": 517, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 713, "end": 717, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 931, "end": 935, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1048, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1114, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1295, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1980, "end": 1983, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2530, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2570, "end": 2574, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3062, "end": 3066, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3440, "end": 3444, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3641, "end": 3645, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 3646, "end": 3649, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications of the JAK-STAT Pathway in Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases"}, {"text": "STAT3 signals downstream of IL-6 and is critical for the differentiation of T-helper (Th)17 cells, which secrete cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 [49, 50] , among others.

Recently tofacitinib received positive opinion from European Medicine Agency (EMA) for its use in RA [67] . Current Jakinibs act by competitively blocking the adenosine triphosphate-binding site in the JH1 domain through non-covalent interactions [5] . Structural similarities of this binding site to the active domains of several other Tyrosine kinases presented a challenge for the development of a compound that would specifically block JAKs without off-target effects [5] . Furthermore, given the high conservation of the JH1 domain among JAKs, developing a Jakinib that would selectively block one JAK was even more challenging [5] . Despite these difficulties, multiple Jakinibs have been developed with reasonable specificity [5] and it has become apparent that pan-Jakinibs, with activity against multiple JAKs, are efficacious with an acceptable adverseeffect profile.

A number of opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster, tuberculosis, cellulitis, panniculitis, septic shock, and osteomyelitis were also reported [3, 142] . The observed risk was similar to that with other DMARDS, and a retrospective meta-analysis of pooled data from all the trials and extension studies indicated a lower risk of infection in tofacitinib-treated patients than for patients treated with biological DMARDs [142] . The exception to this is varicella zoster virus, for which the risk of reactivation is substantially higher in tofacitinib-treated patients [143, 144] .

However, NK cell counts are not markedly reduced in tofacitinibtreated patients; therefore, the etiology of zoster reactivation may be related to NK cell function or to effects on a different leukocyte population.

At present, tofacitinib is the only Jakinib approved for autoimmune disease, but several more may soon follow as new data emerge and the development of novel agents continues. Clinical trials are ongoing with various Jakinibs in several autoimmune conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to psoriasis. Similarly, diseases characterized by serum elevations of JAK-dependent cytokines could respond well to Jakinibs. These include diseases for which a type I IFN signature has been defined such as SLE, myositis, scleroderma, and primary Sjogren's syndrome, as well as diseases driven by IL-6 such as relapsing polychondritis and large-vessel vasculitis. Several trials are indeed probing the efficacy of Jakinibs in the treatment of diseases characterized by an IFN signature, based on preclinical data [194] and on the observation that baricitinib is effective for the treatment of monogenic interferonopathies such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome and SAVI [stimulator of interferon genes (STING) associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy], which are also associated with a type I IFN signature [138] .

Investigations of non-oral formulations of Jakinibs are also in the preliminary stages for diseases including psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, and ocular disease. Finally, biomarker development is ongoing to identify groups of patients with disease likely to respond to Jakinibs, as complex rheumatologic diseases may be driven by JAK-dependent cytokines to a different degree in different patients [198] . After the era of biologics, the development of Jakinibs and their successful use in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases heralds an exciting new chapter in rheumatology. These drugs are unique both structurally and functionally, as small molecules that can be administered orally rather than injected, and which simultaneously block multiple cytokines downstream of their receptors.
