Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition todate, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28-42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.",

First-line prevention strategies against acquisition comprise of the use of condoms and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), or abstinence from drugs or sex 4 . However, epidemiological studies have identified varying degrees of susceptibility to HIV-1, suggesting that host genetics may play a role in moderating acquisition, which could be explored in the context of preventive strategies. For example, studies conducted prior to the development of antiretroviral therapy observed that less than a third of babies born from HIV-1-positive mothers acquire HIV-1 5 and, similarly, that a proportion of highly exposed individuals are resistant to infection 6 . Supporting this hypothesis, homozygosity of the \u039432 mutation of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene has been shown to protect against HIV-1 infection 7-9 , as the encoded protein is a co-receptor needed for viral entry. However, it remains unknown whether common genetic risk factors are also involved in host susceptibility to acquisition.",

A better understanding of both behavioral and biological factors influencing acquisition has the potential to improve our basic comprehension of acquisition, inform prevention strategies and clinical trials, and reduce social stigma. In this context, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify variants and risk mechanisms implicated in HIV-1 acquisition. No genome-wide significant polymorphisms have been robustly associated with HIV-1 acquisition to-date 10-16 . significant associations using a wide range of p-value thresholds, from p = 0.001 to p = 0.5, with 0.001 increments. This allowed us to determine the optimal P T that explained the most variance. Furthermore, as part of a sensitivity test, once an optimal polygenic predictor was established, we tested its ability to predict inflammatory markers: (i) once the MHC region was excluded, (ii) when applied to individuals of European-only ancestry. This was performed to confirm that the result was not driven by confounding effects related to the complex structure of the MHC region, or to the genetic admixture in the SELCoH sample.",

For example, gene enrichment analyses can be applied to summary statistics to identify genes involved in risk, as well as cell types more likely mediating susceptibility. This is achieved by averaging association signals from multiple neighboring polymorphisms within protein-coding genes, and comparing lists of the resulting genes to the transcriptional profiles of mammalian cell types 17, 18 . Methods like Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) 19 and Linkage Disequilibrium Adjusted Kinships (LDAK) 20 further allow the estimation of SNP heritability based on GWAS results. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), in turn, can be used to explore genetic overlap between traits, and are useful in establishing the effect genetic predisposition has on biological parameters. PRS could even be used to model genetic risk for a trait (e.g. HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility) in a cohort of unaffected individuals (e.g. HIV-1-negative individuals). This, for example, could allow us to model the impact of genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition on biological systems prior to HIV-1 infection, which could ultimately aid in the identification of new vaccine or drug development strategies. Here, we apply these modern population genetic methods to the largest GWAS of HIV-1 acquisition, and identify novel factors and complex traits associated with HIV-1 acquisition.",

This LDSC-based analysis revealed 9 positive correlations with HIV-1 acquisition, including prospective memory, ascertained using cognitive tests (rg = 0.39, SE = 0.09, P = 7.15 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ); lower levels of education, ascertained by having no higher qualifications (rg = 0.21, SE = 0.05, P = 5.59 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ); self-reported smoking (rg = 0.28, SE = 0.06, P = 1.33 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ); and self-reported vigorous exercising (rg = 0.27, SE = 0.06, P = 2.76 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ; Bonferroni adjusted P (for 516 traits) <0.05 for all; Fig. 1A ; Supplemental Table 1 ). We also observed 5 negative associations with acquisition, including socioeconomic traits like alcohol intake with meals (rg = \u22120.28, SE = 0.06, P = 3.12 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), having a higher qualification (rg = \u22120.20, SE = 0.05, P = 1.99 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ), and age at which female participants had their first live birth (rg = \u22120.25, SE = 0.06, P = 6.46 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ). We validated the Bonferroni-significant genetic correlations using SumHer-GC (Fig. 1B) , and observed highly concordant estimates of genetic correlation calculated between the two methods (Pearson's r = 0.98, P = 2.59 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ). EFCAB14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition. To perform our gene-level enrichment analysis, gene-level statistics and weighted p-values were generated from GWAS summary statistics using MAGMA 22 , adjusting associations for gene size, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and linkage disequilibrium. This analysis revealed a contribution of several protein-coding genes to HIV-1 acquisition, with gene-level Q-Q plots highlighting the degree of polygenicity observed, and the abundance of contributing genes relative to an expected normal distribution ( Fig. 2A ; Supplemental Table 2 ). We identified a novel gene involved in HIV-1 acquisition, the EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 (EFCAB14), on chromosome 1p33 (Z-score = 4.56, enrichment P = 2.56 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , Bonferroni corrected P = 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ), which is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, according to The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project 23 . The highest association signal at this locus is the non-coding variant rs8851 (P = 5.57 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ; Fig. 2B ), which is also an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for EFCAB14. The risk (G-) allele of rs8851 is associated with lower expression of EFCAB14 in multiple tissues, including whole blood, skin, adipose tissue, the cerebellum and arteries (P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for all) 23 . These findings suggest that genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition at this locus is conferred via reduced expression of EFCAB14, and not by altered expression of neighboring genes such as the ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 1 (ATPAF1) or the testis expressed 38 (TEX38) genes (Fig. 2C) . Outside of chromosome 1p33, the top gene-level association signal was on chromosome 15q22.31, at the ubiquitin specific peptidase 3 gene (USP3), although this was not significant after multiple testing correction (enrichment P = 4.96 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , Bonferroni corrected P > 0.05; Fig. 2D ).",

We utilized findings from the GWAS performed by McLaren and colleagues (2013) to calculate www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ predisposition correlated with levels of 35 blood-based inflammatory markers. Our rationale was to better understand how genetic susceptibility expresses itself in the pre-exposed immune system, and in particular how it affects inflammatory cytokines, which are molecules that can be modified via pharmacological intervention, and are thought to be key moderators of HIV-1 infection 25, 26 . A preliminary analysis utilized all polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 acquisition under a P association threshold (P T ) = 0.5 to calculate the PRS, and to test its correlation with the levels of 35 inflammatory markers. This analysis showed that HIV-1 acquisition was significantly and specifically associated with lower levels of the chemokine CCL17 (\u00df = \u22121644.32, standard error (SE) = 496.62, P = 1.00 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , Bonferroni corrected P (for 35 tests) = 3.50 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , variance explained = 2.74%; Fig. 3C ). A sensitivity analysis revealed that PRS at every tested P T also significantly predicted levels of this chemokine, with highest significance at P T = 0.061 (\u00df = \u2212800.52, SE = 180.07, P = 1.14 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , corrected P = 5.11 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , variance explained = 4.84%; Fig. 3D ).

The inverse correlation observed suggests that individuals that have a higher genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition are more likely to have lower blood levels of CCL17 (Fig. 3E ). The correlation values observed for the 14 Bonferroni-significant traits associated with HIV-1 acquisition in the LDSC method were highly concordant with results using the LDAK method (Pearson's r = 0.98, P = 2.59 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ).",

However, the genetic aspects of HIV-1 acquisition (outside of the CCR5 \u039432 mutation) have been understudied, in part because no robust genome-wide significant variants were found in early studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , which led to the premature assumption that acquisition was not substantially moderated by common genetic variants. The GWAS analyzed here, by McLaren and colleagues (2013), did not identify genome-wide significant polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 acquisition (after correcting association signals for frailty bias), but population genetic methods have advanced considerably in recent years, now allowing for powerful inferences about genetic traits using GWAS summary statistics 19, 22, 24, 27 , even in moderately powered studies. For instance, we calculated heritability estimates of HIV-1 acquisition using cutting edge methods like LDSC and LDAK, which would otherwise be challenging using traditional twin and family methods. The level of SNP h 2 observed for acquisition (LDSC: 0.28 \u00b1 0.05; LDAK: 0.42 \u00b1 0.08) was greater or comparable to that of traits considered highly heritable, such as body mass index (LDSC: 0.09 \u00b1 0.01; LDAK: 0.33 \u00b1 0.03), height (LDSC: 0.20 \u00b1 0.02; LDAK: 0.46 \u00b1 0.04), and schizophrenia (LDSC: 0.19 \u00b1 0.01; LDAK: 0.42 \u00b1 0.02) 20 . Overall, these results highlight the contribution of common variants to HIV-1 acquisition risk, showing this is a heritable trait. To understand the underlying genetic factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition, we performed genetic correlation analyses in LD Hub, which leverages on data from ~500,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, to investigate how acquisition genetics correlates with heritable traits assessed in this large population sample. We observed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ genetic correlations between HIV-1 acquisition and heritable phenotypes associated with socio-economic factors, corroborating previous epidemiological work, and further highlighting the need for prevention strategies tailored to individuals who most need it 28 . We further validated the genetic correlations using the independent SumHer-GC method, supporting these results.",

In a preliminary enrichment analysis that aimed to identify the cell types that mediate HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility throughout the body, we observed that polymorphisms implicated in acquisition were enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, which are the main targets for HIV-1 replication 29 . We further tested the enrichment of HIV-1 variants for genes expressed across a range of neural cell types, since these cells mediate behavior and could explain certain genetic correlations observed with HIV-1 acquisition. We observed a significant enrichment for striatal and hippocampal neurons in association with HIV-1 acquisition, which is particularly striking considering they are brain areas implicated in the regulation of reward and pleasure 30, 31 . Alternatively, these cell types may represent those which harbor HIV-1 and most effectively hide it from the immune system, propagating a sustained infection. Furthermore, the gene-level enrichment analysis identified EFCAB14 as a susceptibility gene for HIV-1 acquisition, on chromosome 1p33. This gene is ubiquitously expressed in the body, and the risk www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ allele of rs8851 is known to reduce expression of EFCAB14 across multiple tissues. Proteins containing EF-Hand Calcium Binding domains in general are implicated in functions ranging from intracellular calcium buffering, signal transduction and muscle contraction 32 , but future studies are warranted to investigate the function of EFCAB14 specifically, particularly in the context of HIV-1 acquisition.",

We modelled how genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition expresses itself in the pre-exposed immune profile using a cohort of HIV-1 negative individuals. By considering genetic risk as a continuous trait in a population setting, we can more powerfully determine the influences of the genetic risk signal on innate biological systems such as inflammatory marker expression, without confounders (e.g. drug use, other infections) more commonly associated with individuals from high-risk groups. Moreover, previous studies that have compared high-risk individuals who do not acquire HIV-1, with those that do, are likely confounded by the fact that HIV-1 has an influence on the immune system and inflammatory profile of the individual, which may not correspond to the pre-exposed immune profile associated with risk or resilience. In particular, we studied how genetic predisposition to HIV-1 acquisition affects inflammatory cytokines, which are immune messengers that are relatively easy to assay, can be modified via pharmacological intervention, and are thought to be key moderators of HIV-1 infection 25, 26 . We observed that PRS for HIV-1 acquisition inversely correlated with CCL17 levels in the blood of HIV-1 negative individuals, suggesting that levels of this chemokine should be considered in clinical trials for biomarker, drug and vaccine development. CCL17 is known to regulate the development and maturation of T-cells in the thymus, as well as their trafficking during inflammation [35] [36] [37] . Neutralization of this chemokine by antibody treatment has been shown to block the recruitment of T-cells in the lung (ameliorating respiratory allergy) 38 . We hypothesize that increased CCL17 levels may increase the influx of inflammatory cells, which could help eliminate HIV-1-infected cells before the establishment of a systemic infection. However, CCL17 levels may represent only one of many biological mechanisms implicated in, or co-occurring with, HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility, and further research is needed to better understand this relationship.",

Analyses of larger cohorts from different ancestry groups and well-characterized infection routes have the potential to improve our understanding of HIV-1 acquisition, by improving the identification of specific SNPs and genes involved. Future well-powered GWAS of HIV-1 acquisition comparing high risk individuals who are infected versus those who are not will more likely tease apart the biological risk mechanisms implicated in viral resilience from the behavioral risk factors. This could be studied in areas where the risk for HIV-1 is already relatively high in the general population (e.g. South Africa), and where viral entry and replication may represent more important components of acquisition than risk behaviors. Furthermore, although we validated our estimates of heritability and genetic correlations by using two independent methods, additional cohorts are needed to replicate our findings, including those obtained with the PRS analysis. Moreover, our genetic correlation analysis relies on self-report information from the UK Biobank, where individuals (aged 40+) are probably older than the average age of individuals diagnosed with HIV-1. Consequently, behaviors relevant to HIV-1 acquisition that may be more common in a younger cohort (e.g. drug use), could have been absent (or not reported) in the UK Biobank. Where we do find genetic correlations with HIV-1 risk, we cannot currently infer cause and effect, but this is something which may be achievable in the future via a Mendelian randomization design, once larger GWAS are able to detect robust genome-wide significant predictors of HIV-1 acquisition. Finally, the cytokine panel we investigated in association with PRS for acquisition was limited to 35 proteins, and it is possible that other inflammatory markers which we did not assess may be more relevant to this trait.",

By leveraging on modern population genetic methods, our work provides a novel framework to study HIV-1 acquisition as a complex phenotype, advancing our understanding of the underlying risk factors. Our results suggest that in addition to environmental risk factors, there is a polygenic component to HIV-1 acquisition that should be explored further in clinical studies. In addition, our work supports the investigation of future intervention strategies surrounding education and smoking behavior. In particular, there needs to be studies investigating whether smoking simply represents a proxy for unhealthy behaviors, or whether it actively influences biological processes linked to HIV-1 acquisition. Similarly, CCL17 and EFCAB14 should also be investigated with respect to their potential role as biomarkers for HIV-1 acquisition and as drug targets. As demonstrated here, GWAS can be very informative even when analyzing moderately sized cohorts, but its true potential to unveil the host genetic mechanisms influencing HIV-1 acquisition will likely only be unlocked with the creation of collaborative initiatives and analyses of larger cohorts.",

We used the Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA) to identify genes and cell types associated with HIV-1 acquisition genetics, as described elsewhere 17, 18 . Briefly, gene-level statistics and weighted p-values were generated from GWAS summary statistics, adjusting gene-level associations for gene size, SNP density and LD. Input SNPs were mapped to 18,439 protein coding genes using a 10 kb upstream and downstream window, and a Bonferroni cut-off was applied to determine significance (P cut-off = 0.05/18,439 protein-coding genes = 2.71 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) 19 . Next, the gene-set enrichment analysis used two single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets available in FUMA to identify cell types enriched for genes associated with HIV-1 acquisition under the false discovery rate of 10% (q < 0.10). Specifically, to identify particular tissues or organs involved in HIV-1 acquisition, we tested the transcriptional profile of 75 murine cell types (TabulaMuris_droplet_all) for enrichment with HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility genes. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of well-curated single cell transcriptome data from Mus musculus, containing information from 100,605 cells from 20 organs and tissues 43 . To identify specific neural populations that could drive the behaviors observed in the genetic correlations, we tested the transcriptional profile of 565 neuronal cell types (DropViz_all_level2) for enrichment with HIV-1 acquisition susceptibility genes. This dataset contains the transcriptional signature of 690,000 cells from the mouse brain, which have been previously used to investigate the cellular mechanisms of behavior 44 . the South east London community Health Study. We aimed to assess how HIV-1 acquisition risk might be moderated by an individual's immune profile prior to infection, and so we tested how polygenic risk for HIV-1 acquisition correlated with the expression of 35 inflammatory markers. We studied HIV-1-negative population controls from the South East London Community Health Study (SELCoH) [45] [46] [47] , where HIV-1-negative status was determined based on self-report. For further details on the full SELCoH study, please see Hatch et al. 43 . SELCoH aimed to investigate mental and physical health in the general population in London, UK. The subsample analyzed in our study consisted of 406 individuals for which both inflammatory and genetic data were available. The SELCoH study received approval from King's College London research ethics committee, reference PNM/12/13-152. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants at the time of sample collection. The 35 inflammatory markers represent adequately expressed cytokines from an initial panel of 42, which were originally assayed in relation to major depression risk, as described previously 48 . The mean age of our sample was 48.7 \u00b1 15.1 (standard deviation), with a mean body mass index of 27.3 \u00b1 5.5. The cohort is representative of the source population and consisted of 45.3% males; 20.9% current smokers and 40.4% ex-smokers; and 56.8% White British, 8.4% Black Caribbean, 10.9% Black African, 14.6% White Other, 6.2% Non-White Other, and 3.2% Mixed. Participants received detailed and repeated phenotypic assessments as part of three separate phases. The first phase aimed to assess common physical and mental disorders in South East London; the second, to examine the roles of historical social context and policy in shaping patterns of health inequalities; and the third, to collect biological specimens from a subset of participants, including blood for serum separation and DNA for genotyping. Serum and DNA were extracted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use, as described previously 47,48 . Quantification and analysis of cytokines. Serum levels (pg/mL) of 35 blood-based markers were assessed in blood samples from the SELCoH cohort using multiplex ELISA-based technology provided by the Meso Scale Discovery Biomarker kits, as described previously 48 . For each marker, we adjusted for the effects of assay run, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking (never, current, former) and ethnicity, by taking standardized residuals (z-scores). Z-scores were then used in downstream PRS analyses.",
