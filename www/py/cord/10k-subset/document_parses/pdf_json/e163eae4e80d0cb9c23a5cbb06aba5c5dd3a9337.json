These 35 patients had a median age of 51 years ranging from 28 to 70 years.

The treatment outcome was greatly influenced by the remission status of the transplant recipient at the time when preparation for transplantation was begun, age of the recipient, compatibility with the respective donor and incidence of post-transplant complications. The leading cause for treatment failure remains graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with associated infectious complications, other toxicities or relapse of the underlying disease. Figure 2 illustrates our institutional experience with 36 patients (seven children/adolescents and 29 adults). The median age of the patient population was 35 years ranging from 5 to 60 years. Median follow-up in continued complete remission of survivors is in excess of six years ranging from six months to more than 10 years. Overall survival is 50% with relapse causing treatment failure in 30% of allogeneic HCT recipients. The remaining 20% of patients succumbed to complications such as graft-versus-host disease, infections or veno-occlusive disease. This limited experience is nevertheless representative for the observations made in other trials including results reported from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. Without question, non-relapse mortality (mostly due to GVHD) is a major obstacle to success and alternative technologies need to be explored.",

Furthermore, respiratory insufficiency is included under diagnoses such as graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) or multi organ insufficiency. The largest retrospective analysis of Italian children after allogeneic stem cell transplantation demonstrated a pulmonary mortality of 9% [28] . Case reports as well as retrospective or prospective analyses of different patient cohorts demonstrate between 10% and 40% incidence of irreversible pulmonary function loss after HSCT [68, 14, 48, 65, 43, 11] . The incidence of late-onset non infectious pulmonary complications (LONIPC) is estimated to be approximately 10%. In one study 18 out of 179 patients suffered such complications three months after allogeneic HSCT [60, 10] . There has been no improvement over the past decade (11) .",

In one series of children undergoing transplantation for hematologic diseases, 44% had pulmonary function abnormalities before the procedure (11) . Although the topic of this review is non-infectious pulmonary complications, it is impossible to completely distinguish these from infectious ones, as the latter may trigger hyperimmune reactions, lead to vascular alterations, enhance antigen presentation and fibroblast activity, attract neutrophils and eosinophils with release of their toxic products and disturb the level of immunotolerance. In contrast, augmented immunosuppression in the course of interstitial lung disease enhances the susceptibility for infections leading to additional damage. The extent of pulmonary mortality and morbidity, the degree and the spectrum of pulmonary diseases in children as well as the relevance of possible monocausal or multifactorial etiologic risk factors (GVH-disease, irradiation, chemotherapy especially with cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, busulfane, melphalane) is still classified insufficiently [26, 52, 8, 17, 3] . The introduction of fractional irradiation schedules has led to a reduction of the incidence of interstitial pneumonia [17] . Latent viral infections, GVHD and cytotoxic factors are not well defined in their pathogenetic role and S11 data about the influence of fungi is limited [5, 20, 13] . Histologic evaluations of lung tissue in GVHD-patients show epithelial and interstitial lesions typical for GVHD of the skin and the intestine [83]. There is some evidence for an active role of CMV in bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) as well as in interstitial pneumonias. Since the detection of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be taken as an indicator of invasive infection [9, 69, 63] , screening for CMV in BAL and blood has been suggested as a basis for rigorous treatment [38, 1, 30, 39, 25] . The same may hold true for other viruses such as adeno-, EBV, influenza, parainfluenza virus, HHV-6 and RSV (75, 34) .",

If one follows lung function parameters over time in clinically asyptomatic patients after HSCT for childhood leukemia [11] , abnormalities can be observed in more than 80% of patients with predominance of a restrictive pattern 6 months after transplantation (possibly due to conditioning). Lung function abnormalities tend to persist in patients with advanced disease states before transplantation but decrease by 50% in those with transplantation at early stages of childhood leukemia, suggesting a summation of adverse effects. Toxic pulmonary reactions may occur within 90 days after irradiation. Clinically overt non-infectious pulmonary complications in the neutropenic (early) phase after transplantation occur in the form of engraftment-syndrome, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) or diffuse alveolar hemorrhagesyndrome (DAH). Furthermore the lung can be part of a systemic vascular process (capillary-leak-syndrome, thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura or cytokine-syndrome).

Infections by herpes virus have reached their nadir 90 days post HSCT. However, all viral, bacterial and fungal infections can also occur at a later time point depending on the state of immunity, donor selection, and preparation of the transplant. Furthermore, GVHD and its therapy play a pathogenetic role in the development of so-called noninfectious pulmonary complications. The treatment or prophylaxis of infectious diseases may have equally profound impact on the pattern of non-infectious lung diseases observed (4).",

Some of these alterations were defined at the 1991 NIHLBI Workshop in Bethesda as \"idiopathic pneumonia syndrome\" (IPS) [15] . Immediately after transplantation the so-called \"engraftment syndrome\" or \"capillary-leak syndrome\" play an important role (47) , which has to be distiguished from diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) or the idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. The latter ones are considered primarily as forms of ARDS because their time course, their histopathologic morphological criteria and their clinical appearance closely resemble this complicationwhich, despite various causes, generally has an unfavourable prognosis [12, 13] . The incidence of IPS after allogeneic HSCT has been reported as 12% [15] or 8% [41] for all ages, and is certainly lower for all donors among children. The mortality of this complication is high, despite intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation (36) . According to a retrospective analysis of 1165 HSCT patients, mortality is estimated to be around 70% [41] . Essential diagnostic criteria are (1) indicators of diffuse alveolar damage (multilobular infiltrates in thorax X-ray or disturbance of gas transfer, a restrictive ventilatory defect, clinical signs of pneumonia) and (2) the exclusion of active infection of lower airways by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or transbronchial biopsy (TBB). Patients with severe acute graft versus host disease (GVHD grade III-IV) have a largely increased risk of developing IPS. It has not been clear whether IPS after transplantation represents T-cell-mediated lung damage (e.g. \"acute GVHD of the lung\") or is triggered by occult viral infections (e.g. adeno or HHV-6), or can be considered as a consequence of a multiple organ failure during generalised activation of inflammatory mediators (analogous to the multifactorial ARDS of non-transplanted patients) in acute GVHD, in the course of viral infections or sepsis. There is no specific therapy for the IPS to date. Therefore diffuse infiltrates on X-ray after transplantation have to be subject to a thorough work-up. If they do not respond to diuretics (to exclude pulmonary edema), they have to be evaluated radialogically, treated empirically for a short time and/or evaluated invasively depending upon the radiological appearance before or shortly after the start of antibiotics. Diagnostic criteria for \"capillary leak syndrome\", which also occurs in the early phase after transplantation, are inadequate weight gain and disturbance of gas transfer. Therapy with C1-esterase inhibitor is currently under evaluation (56) .",

            "text": "Because of its high mortality, the late complication \"bronchiolitis obliterans\" (BO) stands -together with non-classifiable interstitial pneumonia, -in the first line of differential diagnoses for non-infectious pulmonary complications after HSCT. Not unlike BO after lung transplantation, the etiology remains unclear. Lymphocyt-ic bronchitis, alloreactivity after pathologic expression of antigens due to stress (viral, radiation, medications), malnutrition of the bronchial wall, vascular changes, occult aspirations -are all considered to be causative events (71) . Histologically the disease resembles BO in patients after heart-lung and lung transplantation; it is interpreted as chronic rejection (prevalence >35%) with high mortality (25%) [79] . The first description of BO after allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation dates from 1982 [66] . Since then this complication has been described after all types of transplantation, including cord blood cell transplantation [57] . In adults one assumes a prevalence of bronchiolitis obliterans after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation in a range between 5-10% [62, 81] . In children, incidences of up to 20% have been reported [68] . If unrecognised, this late complication tends to be lethal, since the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids in advanced stages is poor. The speed of progression for BO and the ideal time for therapeutic intervention are unknown. BO is frequently associated with chronic GVHD [81, 60] and they occur in combination in up to 10% of adult patients [42] and up to 30% in children with GVHD [68] . The clinical symptoms are nonspecific with expiratory wheeze, cough, dyspnoea and hypoxia upon exertion. Typical HR-CT-signs of the thorax for BO are peripheral hypovascularity, enlargement of segmental-and subsegmental bronchi, fixed hyperinflation (\"mosaic pattern\"), and deformed peripheral vessels [31, 67, 6, 80, 35, 58] . It is debatable, however, whether these signs are also typical for BO after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Some of these signs can only be interpreted correctly if sequential examinations have been performed. Furthermore, CT studies in children are rare. In BAL differential cytology the relative number of neutrophils is elevated [70] . The definite diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans can frequently only be achieved by open lung biopsy. The histopathological finding is bronchiolar inflammation with luminar scarring, fibrous tissue and obliteration of the small bronchioli without occluding the alveolar ducts. In lung function the small airways are affected first (hyperinflation) and there is exercise limitation without hypoxia. The involvement of vessels can vary. Therapeutically, systemic glucocorticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, chloroquine, glucocorticosteroid pulses, cyclosporine, anti-thymocyte globulin, tacrolimus, methotrexate, total lymphoid irradiation, thalidomide, clofazimine, extracorporal photopheresis, humanized monoclonal anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies are applied in BO without convincing success. Furthermore, there have been no controlled studies of any of the above-mentioned medications. As a number of interstitial diseases in childhood have shown a favourable response [22, 61, 59] , our approach is to try to detect the disease at an incipient stage and use methylprednisolone pulse therapy as a first-line treatment (32) . In about 30-50% of cases, at least a temporary response can be seen. Unfortunately, the time window for intervention is small in most cases and the speed of progression extremely variable, rendering evaluation of therapeutic success difficult. Complications of BO are pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, bronchiectases, hypercapnia and pulmonary hypertension with cardiac failure.",

In the literature BOOP has been described in autoimmune diseases, after medication,as well as with viral and bacterial infection and as idiopathic BOOP [18] . Lately a number of cases have been published after HSCT with GVHD [44, 48, 74, 40] . There are also reports on early and fulminant courses [55, 16, 82] . The clinical picture is non-specific, with cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. Lung function shows a restrictive pattern and impairied diffusion capacity. Histopathology demonstrates granulation -and fibrous tissue in terminal bronchioles reaching into alveoli -as well as interstitial lymphocytic inflammation. Cellular profiles of BAL show high lymphocyte counts, with low CD4/CD8-ratio (results from adults) [64] . Characteristic HR-CT-patterns in BOOP are ground-glass opacification and nodular shadows [29] . Typical bilateral, focal, predominantly peripheral infiltrates can be detected earlier using HR-CT rather than by X-ray of the thorax [51, 46] . In the literature (including patients after HSCT) the beneficial effect of treatment with glucocorticosteroids is emphasized beginning at an early stage and continuing for 6-12 months (18, 40, 44, 48, 50, 75) .",

This should make it possible to gain insight into the pathogenesis of the diseases and examine whether bronchiolitis obliterans can be prevented by therapeutical measures at an early stage.

As a prerequisite, risk factors should be carefully studied and causal strategies developed in a multicenter approach. (7) ",

The heterogeneity of receptor-mediated endocytosis systems limits the extent of hydrolase uptake among various cell types and tissues [38, 40] . Direct intercellular transfer of hydrolase occurs independent of specific receptors but requires cell-to-cell contact and participation of adhesion molecules such as LFA-1 and -3, ICAM-1, -2, and -3, and CD2 (the sheep erythrocyte receptor on T lymphocytes) [2, 34] . Unlike lysosomal storage diseases, ALD is due to a defective protein component of the peroxisomal membrane that is neither secreted from normal cells nor transferred between cells, leading to defective oxidation and elevated plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) [30] . Co-culture with normal cells does not improve VLCFA oxidation by ALD fibroblasts, indicating that improvement of ALD after HCT is likely due to repopulation by metabolically normal cells instead of intracellular transfer of molecules from donor cells. Other beneficial effects of allogeneic HCT in ALD include normalization of plasma VLCFA levels and decreased perivascular inflammation.",

Microglia are derived from hematopoietic precursors that normally enter the brain from the peripheral circulation during embryonic and early postnatal life but not in adulthood [35] . In rodent HCT recipients, donor-derived cells can be identified throughout the CNS [12] and over time completely repopulate the microglial compartment [18, 22, 59] . In feline \u03b2-mannosidosis, these donor cells effectively transfer lysosomal hydrolase to recipient neurons in vivo [52] . After HCT, donor-derived cells also differentiate into other non-neuronal CNS cell populations such as astrocytes (also referred to as macroglia) [5, 31] . Postmortem studies confirm that donor mononuclear cells are also present throughout the brains of human allogeneic HCT recipients [51] . The kinetics of repopulation of microglia after HCT is slower than that observed with other mononuclear phagocytes like pulmonary alveolar macrophages and hepatic Kupffer cells [3, 25] . In humans, post-HCT repopulation with donor-derived microglia requires approximately 1 year, which may explain the ineffectiveness of allogeneic HCT in stabilizing or pre-venting neurological deterioration in some rapidly progressive storage diseases [24, 25] .",

The most extensive studies of HCT in preclinical storage disease models have been in canine \u03b1-L-iduronidase deficiency (a model of mucopolysaccharidosis [MPS] IH, or Hurler syndrome) [3, 8, 45] , murine \u03b2-galactosidase deficiency (a model of MPS VII, or Sly syndrome) [4, 42, 55] , and murine galactosylceramidase deficiency (the \"twitcher\" mouse, a model of the sphingolipidosis globoid cell leukodystrophy [GCL]). We have extensively studied HCT in the twitcher murine model [49] , which most closely resembles Krabbe disease, the early infantile form of human GCL. HCT leads to prolonged survival, clinical improvement, attenuation of hindlimb paralysis [57, 58] , remyelination in peripheral nerves and CNS [58] , and stabilization of motor nerve conduction velocities [50] in presymptomatic twitcher mice but is of no benefit in symptomatic animals. After HCT, galactosylceramidase is present in the CNS and non-neural tissues [14, 60] , and levels of the toxic metabolite psychosine (galactosylsphingosine) [15] , are significantly decreased in the CNS [14] . Postnatal HCT is not curative in murine GCL, most likely because repopulation of the CNS and peripheral nervous system with donor cells does not occur rapidly enough to stabilize the progressive demyelination. Murine GCL may be an important model for critical evaluation of the effects of intrauterine cellular transplantation for infantile-onset sphingolipidosis.",

Characteristic globoid cells, derived from microglia or CNS macrophages and containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive myelin breakdown material, are present in the brains, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Interestingly, the widespread demyelination in GCL is due to accumulation of psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which is derived from the substrate galactosylceramide and is toxic to both oligodendroglia and Schwann cells [15] .",

Patients with early (age of onset, 3 to 6 months) or late (age of onset, 6 months to 3 years) infantile GCL have profound psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, spasticity, seizures, optic atrophy and cortical blindness [10] . Juvenile GCL affects children from 3 to 10 years of age, with insidious onset and progression of visual loss, lower extremity spasticity, and in some patients dementia. Adult GCL occurs in patients over age 10 years and is characterized by slowly progressive difficulty in walking, long-tract signs, asymmetric weakness of the extremities, and difficulties with coordination and balance, but intellect is generally unaffected [20] . Allogeneic HCT is not curative in symptomatic early infantile GCL (Krabbe disease), in which neurodegeneration persists despite post-transplant biochemical improvement [23, 26] , analogous to observations in the preclinical studies of HCT in murine GCL. Although very limited experience suggests that presymptomatic infants with infantile GCL may benefit from HCT [26] , early identification of the affected infant and of a suitable HCT donor are obvious practical challenges to this therapeutic strategy. The role for allogeneic HCT is more firmly established in patients with presymptomatic or minimally symptomatic juvenile or adult GCL, in whom HCT leads to stabilization and gradual improvement in clinical, neurological and neurocognitive status [13, 26, 43] .",

Affected infants have painful joint swelling, multiple painful subcutaneous nodules, hoarseness, swallowing difficulties, and failure to thrive [6] . Microscopic examination of the nodules shows granulomata containing ceramide-laden macrophages. Granulomata in the aerodigestive tract cause hoarseness and deglutition problems. Hepatomegaly, recurrent pulmonary infections and respiratory difficulties are common and due in large part to organ infiltration by ceramide-laden macrophages. Infants with Farber disease die with progressive and profound psychomotor retardation at a mean age of 18 to 20 months [29] . Two infants with Farber disease received allogeneic BMT at 18 months [47] and 9 months [61] of age, respectively. Subcutaneous nodules, joint pain and hoarseness regressed within 2 months after transplant in both patients. The older patient had progressive neurodegeneration and died 6 months after BMT. The younger patient, who had mild developmental delay and slight hypotonia at BMT, had progressive psychomotor retardation and graft failure, with a developmental age of 4 months at chronological age 32 months. Despite loss of donor cell engraftment, levels of ceramidase in the peripheral blood leukocytes remained in the donor heterozygous range, suggesting ongoing production of ceramidase by non-circulating donor cells and hydrolase uptake by recipient blood cells [61] . These limited observations indicate that HCT does not stabilize the rapid neurological deterioration in classic Farber disease.",

            "text": "Among new approaches for treatment of metabolic disorders by cellular transplantation, intrauterine HCT may be worthy of exploration, especially in the rapidly progressive infantile forms in which postnatal HCT is not effective. The major limitation to this approach is the low levels of donor cell engraftment, which may not provide sufficient hydrolase or metabolically active cells to correct the underlying biochemical defect [17] . Allogeneic HCT using reduced-intensity nonmyeloablative preparative regimens may be considered in some indolent forms of storage diseases, providing gradual donor cell engraftment without the risk of aplasia and other short-and long-term toxicities associated with intensive marrow-lethal preparative regimens [19, 46] . The use of these regimens is not feasible in more aggressive forms of storage diseases. Insertion of genes for specific lysosomal hydrolases or for the ALD protein into autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and transplantation of these cells is theoretically very attractive but remains at the level of preclinical investigation at this time because of ongoing challenges such as efficient introduction and integration of the exogenous gene in truly primitive HSCs and sustained, consistent high-level expression of the hydrolase in these cells and their progeny [41] . A potentially exciting approach for storage diseases with skeletal manifestations (dysostosis multiplex) is the co-transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which may differentiate into chondrocytes and osteoblasts [33, 39] . Although clearly not a clinical therapeutic option at this time, intracerebral injection of MSCs may favorably affect the neuropathological and biochemical abnormalities in a murine model of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick disease types A and B) [16] .",
