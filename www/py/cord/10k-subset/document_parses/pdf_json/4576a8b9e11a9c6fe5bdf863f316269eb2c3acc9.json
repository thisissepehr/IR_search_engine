The plateau of the cardiac action potential is shortened in hypoxic conditions '-4 , and the ATP content falls below 10% of the control, which is low enough to activate the A TP-sensitive K+ channels 16 \u2022 Thus, the marked increase in the outward current, which was reversed by an intracellular injection of ATP 5 , can be attributed to the activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. The shortening of the action potential is accompanied by a decrease in contraction 17 which is a major mechanism consuming ATP. Therefore, activation of the ATP-sensitive channel may prevent further depletion of A TP and protect the cell from irreversible impairment of its energy metabolism 16 \u2022 More recently, Trube and Hescheler 18 reported a similar ATP-sensitive channel in guinea pig ventricular cells.",

The work was supported by Grants-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan. We have postulated that an excitatory postsynaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) may open voltage-sensitive K+ ('M') channels\\ in an appropriate depolarizing range, and that this could alter the e.p.s.p. waveform. Consequently, the fast e.p.s.p. in neurones of sympathetic ganglia, elicited by a nicotinic action of acetylcholine (ACh) 2 , could be followed by a hyperpolarization, produced by the opening of M channels during the depolarizing e.p.s.p. and their subsequent slow closure (time constant-150 ms) 1 \u2022 This introduces the concept that transmitterinduced p.s.ps may trigger voltage-sensitive conductances other than those initiating action potentials, and that in the present case this could produce a true post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization. (Some hyperpolarizations other than inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps) have been reported to follow e.p.s.ps 3 _j Fig. 1 Post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization and e.p.s.p. amplitude. Intracellular recordings are of a B neurone, partially curarized, with an average of 20 responses (Nihon Kohden KK) for each tracing. The bathing medium, held at 23-25 \u00b0C, contained 112 mM NaCJ, 2 mM KCI, 1.8 mM CaC1 2 , 2.4 mM NaHC0 3 , 0.5 mM MgCI 2 and 5 mM glucose. Traces show the response to single stimulus (a) and to two preganglionic stimuli, the second of which elicited an e.p.s.p. with larger peak amplitude (b). Resting V m = -53 mY for both a and b. The e.p.s.p. is preceded by a stimulus artefact and followed by the longer, tail-like post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization (downwards). (Differences in stimulus artefacts even for identical stimulus pulses are due to characteristics of the digital amplifier in the averaging device.) Calibration : 1.5 mV (intracellular negative, downwards) and 20 ms. For all intracellular studies of e.p.s.ps, orthodromic firing was routinely eliminated by moderately depressing the e.p.s.p. with (+)tubocurarine at 20-30 1-Lg ml -1 (30-44 ~J.M). (However, post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization was also observed in the absence of (+)tubocurarine; such an e.p.s.p., free of an action potential, was produced when its orthodromic volley was timed to arrive during the refractory period following a preceding somatic action potential, elicited by a direct depolatizing stimulus via the intracellular electrode.) Atropine (1.4 ~J.M) was routinely added to eliminate any hyperpolarizing slow i.p.s.p. component 5 , except when testing the effects of muscarine (as in Fig. 3a-c) .",

However, the afterhyperpolarizations and the recovery phase of the e .p.s.ps were both voltage-dependent, whether changes in initial resting V m were spontaneously encountered or imposed by applied current. With spontaneous resting V ms between -45 and -60 mY, 54 cells all exhibited post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization, while five cells at potentials more negative than -70 mY showed none. When the resting V m was altered by an applied current, the amplitude and duration of the poste.p.s.p . hyperpolarization decreased progressively as v m became hyperpolarized; the post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization disappeared at V m values between -60 and -65 mY and did not reverse at more negative potentials (see Fig. 2 ). Conversely, during the recovery phase of the e.p.s.p. itself, there was less overlap by the hyperpolarizing component, so that the total duration of the e.p.s.p. increased to about 150 ms at Vms between -65 and -70 mY (Fig. 2) . The differences among reported time constants for the decay of e.p.s.ps (see refs 3, 6) may be explained by this influence of the resting V m on poste.p .s.p. hyperpolarization and the onset of the hyperpolarization process during the e.p.s.p.",

A set of these three responses, in vertically descending order, is shown for each of four initial levels of V m on the voltage--current (V-I) curve; a, initial Vm=-48mY; b, -53 mY; c, -61 mY; d, -71 mV, with an arrow from each Vm indicating its position on the V-I curve. All responses shown were obtained with intracellular electrode in the same B neurone. Applied current was passed through the recording electrode, using a balancing bridge circuit to eliminate effects introduced by the electrode resistance. Points on the V-I curve represent steadystate values during 500-ms constant-current pulses, starting from resting Vm=-48mY. In each group of three responses, the top tracing is the e.p.s.p. response, preceded by the single preganglionic stimulus artefact (1); the centre trace is the electrotonic potential induced by an applied constant outward current pulse, 0.09 nA for 20 ms (2); the bottom trace is the action potential fired by a direct intracellular stimulus (3 ms, outward current pulse, whose large artefact precedes each spike) (3). The top and middle tracings each represent an average of 20 responses, elicited at 1 per 5 s. Calibration: 2 mV and 40 ms for top and middle tracings; 40 m V and 10 ms for bottom tracings in each group of three responses. Note that after hyperpolarizations for both the e.p.s.ps and the electrotonic depolarizing pulses show a similar voltagesensitivity; they disappear when the initial V m is close to -60 mV and do not reverse at more negative V ms. For the action potential, the afterhyperpolarization is still definite at V m = -71 mY, and it could be reversed at V mS negative to -85 or -90 mY.",

The above evidence supports the proposal that the poste.p.s.p. hyperpolarization is a voltage-activated response; it is induced when the e.p.s.p. sufficiently depolarizes the membrane, and it can thus 'contaminate' the e.p.s.p. response. The dependence of post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization on the amplitude of the e.p.s.p. further indicates that it is a true afterhyperpolarization rather than a separate, transmitter-induced p.s.p.; the relationship was seen whether the amplitude of the e.p.s.p. was varied by repetition of input (as in Fig. 1 ) or by strength of curarization. (When e.p.s.ps were more strongly suppressed by greater curarization, post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarizations were also smaller or absent.) That the voltage-activated post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization is a function of the opening of M channels by the e.p.s.p. is indicated by (1) the similarity of the range of V min which both appear, and (2) blockade of both by muscarine, but not by TEA. The more than linear increase in post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization when the amplitude of the e.p.s.p. was increased (Fig. 1 ) would be expected, as M channel conductances do show progressively greater increases with increasing depolarization of V min the range between -60 m V and -40 m V (ref. 1). Post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarizations are of briefer duration and have smaller time constants than do those obtained for M-channel closure when a depolarized Vm is changed suddenly to a hyperpolarized holding level' , but this is also readily explainable: M channels that are increasingly opened as e.p.s.p. depolarization rises, would begin to close progressively during the slow, descending, repolarizing limb of the e.p.s.p. Thus, the duration and time constant solely of the post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization phase that survives after the end of e.p.s.p. depolarization would not reflect the total time of the whole process.",

            "text": "Effects of ATP, ADP and AMP at various concentrations. The potential of the inside-out patch membrane was maintained at +20 mV, where the single-channel current is outward-going (upward deflections in current recordings in A). The electrode solution contained 50 mM K+ (see Fig. 2). A, The upper trace was obtained in the absence and the lower trace in the presence of 0.2 mM ATP at the inner surface of the membrane. ATP; shortened the open time of the channel without affecting the unitary amplitude of the current. The overlap of up to three open channels in the upper trace was rarely observed in the presence of ATP. B, Shows the decrease in the average current through the ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the presence of ATP, ADP and AMP. The average current was calculated by integrating current flow during the channel openings and dividing the integral by the total time of the sample (generally 20-30 s of data at each ATP concentration). Average current is given by NPI, where N is the number of channels in the patch, P the probability that a single channel is open and I the amplitude of the single-channel current. Values are mean\u00b1s.e. of six ATP experiments and the average of three ADP or AMP experiments.",

Muscarine eliminated the poste.p.s.p. hyperpolarization, even when the e.p.s.p. amplitude was restored to pre-muscarine value by repetition of input in c. (The smaller amplitude of e.p.s.ps in muscarine is presumably due to an additional effect of muscarinic agonists in frog ganglia, namely a presynaptic depression of the release of ACh 7 .) d-f, TEA (5 mM) already present, and resting V m maintained at -58 mV; afterhyperpolarizations still follow both the e.p.s.p. in d and the applied depolarizing pulses in e, f (constant current, 20 ms at 0.07 nA for e and 0.11 nA for f ). That TEA was having its expected effect on other K .. channels was evident in a prolongation of the action potential (not shown). Calibration: 4 mVand 20 ms for a-c ; 1 mV and 20 ms for d-f.",
