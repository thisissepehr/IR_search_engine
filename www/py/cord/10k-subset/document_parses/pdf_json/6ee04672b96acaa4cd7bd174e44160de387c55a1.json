MALDI-TOF MS below 2000 Da shows the presence of organotin and acyclovir units containing these two moieties.

Our approach is to utilize known successful drugs and to incorporate them into polymers where the other ''co-monomer'' can also act to enhance the biological activity. In the present research we are coupling the biological activity of organotin moieties with the biologically active acyclovir. We are creating drugs that are active through at least two different routes lessening the potential for the microorganism to mutate to non-susceptible forms and increasing the chances that the microorganism is effectively inhibited.",

The synthesis of acyclovir was first reported in 1974 by the Welcome Research Laboratories [1, 2] . Acyclovir, 9-(2-2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine was initially called acycloguanosine because the sugar ring of guanosine was opened up. Acyclovir is widely used to inhibit several herpes viruses, particularly HSV-1 and HSV-2 [3] . It is also used to treat varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective. Thus, acyclovir is a first line antiviral drug.",

It is important to understand the stability of polymers in solution. Thus molecular weight was studied over a three-month period in HMPA (Table II) . The diethyltin product showed good stability with chain loss of only about 25% over the three-month period. The dimethyltin product's chain length decreased over 99% over the test period. Even so, all of the products remained polymeric over this period of time. Tests are planned where chain length will be studied in a HMPA-water mix more closely approximating chain stability in the human body. Reaction conditions: Diorganotin dihalide (3.0 mmol) dissolved in 30 ml of heptane is added, at room temperature (about 25\u00b0C) to a rapidly stirred (18,500 rpm no load) solution of ayclovir (3.0 mmol) and sodium hydroxide (6.0 mmol) dissolved in 30 ml of water and run for about 10 s. Infrared spectral results are consistent with the presence of moieties derived from the organotin and acyclovir. Following is a brief discussion of some of the assignments. All infrared assignments are given in terms of cm )1 and are consistent with literature assignments [4, 7, 14] . Results for the product between dimethyltin dichloride and acyclovir will be described. Bands at about 3100 are assigned as arising from C-H aromatic stretching from the acyclovir. Bands at about 2715 are assigned to the C-H aliphatic stretch from the aliphatic ether arm on the acyclovir. Bands at about 2540 are assigned to C-H stretching of methyl groups on the dimethyltin moiety. The band at about 1700 is assigned as derived from the purine ring in the acyclovir. A band at about 580 is prominent in both the spectra of the product and dimethyltin dichloride and the product and not in acyclovir. It is assigned to the Sn-C asymmetric stretching. The Sn-Cl is found in the range of 315-400 below the range of the instrument used to record the spectra. In acyclovir there is a much broader band(s) from 3500 to 3170 that includes both the N-H and O-H stretching vibrations. Much of the 3500 to 3170 band(s) is missing consistent with the absence of the -OH grouping. There is a band about 3445 that is assigned to the N-H stretch.",

Viruses, for the most part, utilize cellular machinery to replicate the viral genome and produce new virus particles. In an attempt to target viral replication, the cellular processes in uninfected cells are also undesirably affected. Polymeric drugs offer the opportunity to avoid some of these effects. It is of interest that the concentration of cells to be tested varies between whether the goal is to test antiviral activity or ability to inhibit cancer cell growth. In evaluating the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth, 10 4 cells are employed for evaluation while for antiviral activity one hundred times this amount, or 10 6 is employed. The same sized wells are employed such that 10 6 cells form a continuous cell monolayer across the bottom of the plate. The wells containing 10 4 cells have space between cells allowing for ready replication. The conditions are such that within the plates containing 10 6 cells replication occurs no more than once during the test period. For the plates containing 10 4 cells, the lower concentration encourages rapid growth, generally about seven generations, over the test period. Thus, the cells are rapidly growing in the tests employing the lesser numbers employed for cancer studies in comparison to the much slower growing cells for the viral tests. Furthermore, the amount of drug administered is the same for wells containing 10 6 cells as for wells containing 10 4 cells so that the amount of drug per cell within the 10 6 cell tests is dramatically less than that available for the 10 4 plates. Thus, concentration effects are largely responsible for most of the observed differences. Since our intent is both to test for the drugs ability to act as anticancer drugs and to act as antiviral agents, both amounts of initial cells were studied.",

Several observations are gleaned from the data. First in all cases, many of the polymers out performed acyclovir itself. The performance is even greater when compared with the amount of acyclovir present in each sample. In general, the amount of acyclovir within the polymers represents about one half of the weight of the polymer so that all of the polymers out performed acyclovir on a total possible amount of acyclovir moiety present. Second, the order of inhibition, based on the concentration needed to effect 50% inhibition is HSV-1 > VZV > Vaccinia WR > Reovirus ST3 with little inhibition found for the reovirus but outstanding inhibition found for HSV-1 and VZV viruses. Third, the order of viral growth inhibition is similar for each of the viruses and also similar with the GI values found for the associated cancer cell lines. For HSV-1 the order is dibutyltin > diethyltin > diphenyltin = dioctyltin > acyclovir > dicyclohexyltin and These studies are consistent with some of the organotin polymers, namely the dibutyltin, diethyltin and diphenyltin polymers, offering superior inhibition in comparison to acyclovir. These trends are accentuated with respect to acyclovir when considering that only about half of the polymers weight is derived from acyclovir. Thus, the activities are not due to the acyclovir alone, but are enhanced either because of the presence of the organotin moiety, presence of the acyclovir within a polymer, through control release of the acyclovir, or some combination of these factors.",

Much of this work was directed by Ward where a number of octahedral organotin complexes of the form R 2 SnL 2 X 2 where R = Et or Ph, X = Cl or Br, and L 2 = o-phenanthroline or 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole, have shown in vitro antiharpes activity toward both HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) [25] . In addition, a series of mono-, di-, and tri-organotin halides (alkyl and phenyl) exhibited weak antiherpes activity in the same assay system. In a related study [26] , this group looked at the same compounds and their activity against both DNA (herpes virus types 1 and 2), a TK (thymidine kinase deficient) strain of HSV type 1, and vaccinia virus. The RNA viruses were vesicular stomatitis virus, coxsackie virus type B4, sindbis virus type 3, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, the complexes exhibited weak antiviral activity and low selectivity. Most of the complexes were active against one or more of the three strains of HSVs. By comparison, only three complexes were active against any of the RNA viruses. None of the compounds were active against vesicular stomatitis or parainfluenza virus or HIV virus.",
