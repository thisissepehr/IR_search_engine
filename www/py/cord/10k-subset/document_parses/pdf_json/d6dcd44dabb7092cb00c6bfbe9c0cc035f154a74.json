The importance of MMP activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogenesis has been demonstrated. Particularly, the MMP-9 activity increases in CF patients undergoing acute exacerbation, and this correlates with the degradation of its natural tissue inhibitor. The reduction of MMP-9 activity in CF patients by MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) represents an attracting target, although this effort has been largely unsuccessful, mainly due to lack of appropriate drug delivery in the lungs, adverse effects, and poor enzymatic selectivity of compounds. The aim is to synthesize, purify, and fully characterize a new family of MMPIs, armed to be linked to carrier proteins and to determine their biological properties Materials and methods The synthesis of new MMPIs relies on a gram-scale synthetic strategy previously optimized [1, 2] , starting from commercially available glycine and inserting on the aminoacidic nitrogen the pre-formed spacer via Mitzunobu reaction. The terminal carboxylic group of the spacers will be activated as N-hydroxysuccinimide for protein scaffold conjugation.

The Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in CFTR gene, resulting in alteration of the chloride channel activity. Currently, the therapeutic strategies use drugs like potentiators and correctors or their combination. These drugs act in a mutationspecific manner, making these treatments limited to a few kinds of patients.

For an improved clinical evaluation, the patient had undergone further assessment: there were performed sweat tests that led to pathological results: 128 mEq/L, 137 mEq/L and 138 mEq/L. Chymotripsine and fecal elastases were abnormal in multiple evaluations. Chest Xray showed multiple pneumoniae. Coltural sputum showed the presence of S.

In literature the association of cystic fibrosis and down syndrome is rare and accidental. Parents gave consent to patient data publication. Background Type 1 Spinal Muscolar Atrophy (SMA1) is a genetic disorder that affects the spinal motor neuron; the most common form is an autosomic recessive defect of the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1); it generally onsets before 6 months of life presenting with severe hypotonic weakness in the lower limbs, respiratory distress, weak cry, and poor feeding [1] . In several cases Cystic Fibrosis (CF) poor nutritional status is associated to severe malabsorption. In this case the neuromuscular manifestations may involve legs with numbness, tingling, pain, weakness and unsteadiness of gait. We describe a rare case of a patient affected both by CF and SMA1 associated to concomitant clinical manifestations . Case Report A female 13 months-old was affected by CF with pancreatic insufficiency, diagnosed through a positive NBS and two CF-causing mutations [F508del/4016insT] at CFTR genetic analysis. In the first months of life, she was hospitalized for recurrent respiratory infections, poorly responsive to conventional treatment with oral/ intravenous antibiotics and physiotherapy. Contemporary the patient showed a poor growth status despite PERT and progressively a severe hypotonia with delayed acquisition of developmental milestones, not elicitable osteotendinous reflexes, tongue fasciculations with lack of cough reflex. Based on these symptoms Motorplex panel (analysis of genes causing muscle disorders) was performed resulting in a homozygous deletion for SMN1, compatible with diagnosis of type 1 SMA. A modified personalized physiotherapy program was promptly started, including airway clearance techniques with intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation. Total enteral feeding by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was set up with improvement of clinical and nutritional conditions. The patient started experimental therapy with Nusinersen, a modified antisense oligonucleotide that increases the production of fulllength SMN protein, approved for intrathecal use in paediatric and adult patients with SMA. It has been demonstrated that early treatment of this drug is crucial [2] to improve motor development in SMA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 594, "end": 597, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2386, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Based on our knowledge, this is the first case in which these two genetic diseases occur in the same patient.

On the second day of hospitalization, due to the worsening of respiratory symptoms, we supported ventilation with high flow nasal cannula; but for the persistence of the atelectasis on chest Xray, it was decided to have a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme). During the endoscopic session tenacious dense mucous secretions were aspirated, especially from the right bronchus. Chest X-ray after 72 hours from bronchoscopy showed a clear improvement in the ventilation of the right upper lobe with an almost complete resolution of the atelectasis. The bacteriological and virological tests performed on the BAL were positive for high-load cytomegalovirus (CMV) (CMV DNA: 10.228.432 copies/ml) as per current lung infection. Therefore intravenous therapy with Ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/day) was started for 15 days. Plasma and nasopharyngeal aspirate CMV copies were also high (15.021 copies/ml, 243.703 copies/ml, respectively). Congenital CMV infection was excluded through the negative CMV DNA on the Guthrie card conserved at the Regional Neonatal Screening Laboratory (Buzzi Hospital, Milan) and through the serology that confirmed the presence of specific IgM.

The benefits of such a choice have consequences both on the quality of life of the patient and on cost saving: nurses won't waste time looking for a new vascular access, and there will be a reduction in phlebitis, infections and extravasations that can occur when numerous attempts to cannulate are necessary. Patients with chronic diseases are usually mistrustful towards changes, in particular about therapies or devices. In consideration of the fact the CF patient should benefit from a central access, due to the kind of drugs to administer, a compromise had to be reached. The nurses, sometimes have more difficulty in accepting new procedures or devices for their patients or for the work organization.

Diagnosis and specific treatments can be difficult in the clinical practice despite guidelines have been published. The aim of our study is to collect clinical and microbiological data of CF patients with NTM finding followed at our center. Materials and methods Data about CF patients with airway NTM isolation from June 2006 to June 2019 were extracted from our database (with prospectic insertion). Results Airway NTM was reported in 41 patients, representing 5.1% of the whole CF population followed at our center. Females represented 51.22% of our population; delF508 was in homozygosis in 19.51%, and heterozygosis in 56.1%; 73.17% was pancreatic insufficient, while 34.15% had CFRD. Chronic P. aeruginosa, MSSA, MRSA colonization had a prevalence of 82.93%, 36.58%, 12.19% respectively; Aspergillus was found in 61% of patients; S. apiospermum was isolated in 3 patients. First NTM finding resulted at 29.05 \u00b114.27 years old. M. abscessus, M. intracellulare and M. avium spp were isolated in 46.34%, 24.39% and 9.76% respectively. In the transplanted patients included, NTM was isolated in 2 patients after transplantation, in 5 patients before transplantation. Mean FEV1 in the 12 months before NTM finding was 68.45 \u00b124.47 %pred, mean FEF25-75 in the 12 months preceding NTM was 46.80 \u00b149.37 %pred; no change was shown in the 12 months following the first NTM finding. Treatment for NTM was performed in 17 patients (41.46%). The therapy is still ongoing in 5 patients, in 4 of them sputum culture for NTM is still positive (all of them with M. abscessus). Twelve patients concluded the treatment after a minimum duration of 12 months, within this group NTM is still present in 4 patients (all of them with M. abscessus) and eradicated in 8 patients (50% with M. abscessus). Admission to hospital decreased in the 12 months following NTM finding in comparison to 12 months preceding NTM, but this was significant only in the subset of patients treated for NTM. Conclusions NTM prevalence complies to literature. Even if therapy is still ongoing in some patients, NTM was eradicated only in 52.94%, proving the challenging nature of NTM treatment. This appears more evident for M. abscessus than the other species. Fewer hospital admissions in the treated population may suggest a control over infection and inflammation associated to treatment. Assessing treatment response and clinical data in the different NTM species requires wider populations and further studies. Background Since early events in CF patients' life can determine disease progression and burden in later years, there is increasing interest regarding these events. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of PA first identification in preschoolers. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated data regarding 150 2003-2013 birth cohort CF patients with regular follow-up. All patients had chest CT performed at 4-7 years of age, forced spirometry at 6 years and first N2-MBW measurement. Results We identified 3 groups: 61 patients with first PA identification before 2 years of age (group A); 47 patients with first PA at 2-6 years of age (group B); 42 patients without PA up until 7 years of age(group C). Class I or II mutations on both alleles were significantly more frequent in groups A and B (79% and 72.3% vs 36%), with an OR of 5.98 for PA identification before 7 years of age. Pancreatic insufficiency was significantly more frequent in groups A and B than in group C (91.8% e 85.1% vs 40.48%), with an OR of 11.76 for PA identification before 7 years of age. BMI percentile was higher in group C (p<0.01). FEV 1 %pred was worse in group A than in group C (98.66\u00b115.38 vs 107.19\u00b117.35, p=0.012), as was FVC (p=0.029). LCI 2.5% was worse in groups A and B than in group C (9.45 [8.93-12.6] and 10.82 [8.47-13.52] vs 7.91 [7.24-11.13], p= 0.0023); analysis of LCI 2.5%pred was consistent with absolute values; S cond was also significantly worse in groups A and B; S acin was no different between groups. The prevalence of normal lung CT was lower in group A (19,67%, p=0.0006) and B (22,4%, p=0.005), than C (52.38%); PA identification before 2 and 7 years of age associates with an OR of abnormal chest CT of 2.4 and 4.06, respectively. Peribronchial thickness and mucus plugs were significantly more frequent in groups A and B than in group C. No significant difference was shown between groups A and B for all examined parameters. Chronic colonization developed in 19.67% of group A and in 21.28% of group B. MRSA was found in 3.3% of A, 8.5% of B, 4.8% of C. Conclusions Of note, early PA isolation impacts on respiratory function and radiological status in CF preschool children. Nonetheless, chronic colonization only develops in a relatively small subgroup.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence in patients with cystic fibrosis followed at the Cesena's CF Regional Centre and to determine the presence or absence of a correlation between incontinence and age, body mass index and lung function.Materials and methodsThe International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form 2 (ICIQ-UI SF) was administered to female patients aged 10 years and older during routine visits, in a period from November 2018 to May 2019. Patients who received lung transplantation were excluded from the study. Clinical data of participants were collected including height, weight, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and expiratory flow medium forced (MEF 75/ 25). FVC, FEV1 and MEF 75/25 were measured using spirometry, performed on the same day the questionnaire was administered. A statistical analysis was carried out by t-test, a significance level of 95% was considered.ResultsForty-nine (98%) of 50 eligible patients (age: 10-53 years) participated. Twenty patients (41%) reported urinary incontinence. The presence of urinary incontinence was associated with increasing age. There is a correlation between incontinence and lung function (measured by FEV1 and MEF 75/25), although it's not statistically significant (p = 0.06). No correlation was found between UI and body mass index or lung function measured by FVC(Table 1). All incontinent female reported stress UI; the situations that most commonly determine urine losses are coughing/sneezing, physical activity and laughing respectively in 80%, 20% and 10% of the patients. 94% of patients reported that the incontinence doesn't impact on their daily life.ConclusionsUrinary incontinence is a frequent and underestimated condition that commonly affects women with cystic fibrosis, although this problem is often not reported by patients to their physician or physiotherapist, probably due to embarrassment. It's important to identify patients with incontinence because simple exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can improve the situation 3 . Investigating the presence of UI should become part of routine visits. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic hereditary, incurable and chronic disease which causes severe damages to respiratory and digestive tracts. It is the most common genetically inherited disease among caucasians. This disease is caused by defects in CF genes, the so-called mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene population.
