In addition to activating the complement, MBL can induce cytokine production and contribute to a deleterious inflammatory response with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Our aim was to determine if serum MBL levels correlate with the risk of mortality in intensive care units (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Methods Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic characteristics and severity indices were recorded at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza diagnosis within 24-48 h following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL levels. Results are expressed as median and interquartile range. Results Serum MBL levels were studied in 27 patients (age: 56 [IQR 29] years) with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and in 70 healthy controls. Median admission SAPSII and SOFA scores were 49 [IQR 26] and 12 [IQR 5], respectively. Mortality rate after a 30-day was 37%. MBL was significantly higher in non-survivors (3741 [IQR 2336] ng/ml) vs survivors (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml), p = 0.006, as well as control group (1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml), p = 0.01. In contrast, MBL levels in survivors group were significantly lower than the controls group (215 [IQR 1307] ng/ml vs. 1814 [IQR 2250] ng/ml, p = 0.005). MBL cut-off [ 1870 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88.2% for mortality [AUC = 0.82 (95% CI 0.63-0.94)]. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a strong association between MBL levels and mortality (log-rank 7.8, p = 0.005).

It plays an important role in innate immunity [10] . MBL may represent an important barrier to the establishment of influenza virus infection in epithelial cells. The antiviral activity of MBL against influenza viruses remains controversial. Previous in vitro studies have suggested that MBL exhibits anti-influenza virus function by direct neutralization after binding to mannoserich glycans on haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins [15] [16] [17] . However, this needs to be balanced as the antiviral function of MBL may vary among different strains of influenza viruses, depending on the number of potential glycosylation sites on the viral haemagglutinin globular domain. MBL has been shown to inhibit influenza A seasonal H3N2 and seasonal H1N1 viruses through direct neutralization, indirect opsonization, and complement activation, but limited antiviral effect against H7N9 virus [18] . In contrast, MBL can bind to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus but fails to inhibit its infection in human lung epithelial cell line. Ling et al. have demonstrated in an experimental study that upon A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, MBL is internalized with the virus into the cell, where it may associate with TLR3 to further amplify the NF-jB signaling and augment the cytokine production in the human lung epithelial cells (supplementary data). Their findings advocate the adverse immunomodulating role of MBL during A(H1N1)pdm09 BMI body mass index, SAPS II simplified acute physiology score, SOFA sequential organ failure assessment, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, IA Invasive aspergillosis, MBL mannose-binding lectin, ECMO extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, WBC white blood cells, PMN polymorphonuclears infection by upregulating pro-inflammatory response [11] or may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatoryinduced vascular damage and organ failure, as observed in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation, leading to a harmful effect of an excessive MBL expression [19] . In our study, serum MBL concentrations observed were very variable from one patient to another, but clearly lower levels in the survivors group than the non-survivors group comparing to the control group (Fig. 1) . This heterogeneous distribution in the control group can be explained by individual variations in serum MBL levels that may reflect gene polymorphism ranging from (i) homozygotes with a mean MBL concentrations of 2660 ng/ ml (range 40-6790 ng/ml), (ii) heterozygotes with mean MBL concentrations of 830 ng/ml (range 0-4460 ng/ml, and (iii) compound heterozygotes and mutant homozygotes with mean MBL concentrations of 40 ng/ml (range 0-300 ng/ml). Genotype is one of the determinant factors of serum MBL concentrations. However, MBL levels vary significantly among individuals with the same genotype, and the serum MBL concentration may more accurately reflects downstream effector function than genotype. MBL levels do not vary with respect to age, sex, physical exercise, season, time of day, or liver function [16] [20] and are stable during storage at -80\u00b0C through a number of freeze-thaw cycles. Despite these differences in MBL concentrations due to genetic variations, the decrease in serum MBL levels due to MBL consumption during pathogen binding is compensated by an increase in MBL gene transcription during acute infection [12, 13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 173, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 576, "end": 580, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 581, "end": 585, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1033, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1176, "text": "Ling et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1946, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2170, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3205, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3206, "end": 3210, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3524, "end": 3528, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3529, "end": 3532, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2377, "end": 2385, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Usually, MBL acts as a first line of innate immune response against microbial infections, and it may regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release from phagocytes in response to bacterial and fungal stimulations [21] [22] [23] .
