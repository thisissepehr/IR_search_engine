Thus, rate of NSI, although meaning ful, may not accurately reflect the outcomes of greatest interest: disease and death. Further complicating this problem, the latent period from initial infection to dis ease may be measured in years or decades. For example, a HCW may sustain an NSI, become infected with HIV, and not develop clinical symptoms for several years.

The true number of NSIs sustained by HCWs is still unclear, primarily due to un derreporting [13, 14] . HCWs must be made aware of the importance of reporting NSIs so that they receive the appropriate medical treatment. In our study, only 28.7% of injured HCWs reported all NSIs and had seen a physi cian after the incident. Other studies have examined the problem of underreporting: Panlilio et al. found an underreporting rate of 57% [15] . Our results illustrate the importance of targeting prevention measures at specific groups, such as physicians, that would other wise not be identified by routine reporting mechanisms. Physicians in particular often fail to report NSIs, as con firmed in a number of studies [16] . Previous studies have shown that selfassessment of low risk and selfcare for NSIs are reasons for underreporting by physicians [17] . In our study, reasons for not reporting an NSI included little or no perception of risk by the employee (15.3%), being too busy (29.0%) and dissatisfaction with long waiting times and followup procedures (28.9%). HCWs who do not report injuries because they are too busy create a challenge for preventive measures and must be made aware of the longterm risks of possible serocon version as opposed to simply the shortterm impact on their work load. Dissatisfaction with followup proce dures is an important criticism. Standardizing the post exposure procedures might help, as well as minimizing waiting times, so that staff can report injuries even if they are busy. All staff should report injuries and should do so quickly.

Preventive measures should be introduced in all specialties. The use of cutresistant gloves may re duce NSIs; for example, from bone fragments during pal pation. Double gloving lowers the risk of innerglove per forations [18] . The implementation of safety devices has provided HCWs with new ways of reducing NSIs.
