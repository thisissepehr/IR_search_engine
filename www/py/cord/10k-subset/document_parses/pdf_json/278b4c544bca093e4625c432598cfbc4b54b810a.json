However, there has been international concern in the medical community about pandemic risk due to aerosol transmission. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis by Memish et al to screen for nasal carriage of MERS-CoV in a large group of Hajj pilgrims has been an important advance in the public health response to MERS-CoV. However, we have a few methodological concerns about their study.",

Furthermore, in a recent study, the median incubation period and serial interval (defined as the time between the successive onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission) of MERS-CoV were found to be 5.2 days and 7.6 days, respectively [3] . Additionally, van Doremalen et al investigated the stability of MERS-CoV under different environmental conditions and reported that it can remain viable for 24-72 hours [4] .",
