Leukocyte contact with endothelium might be transient, reversible, and activation-independent. In this phase, cells roll across the endothelial surface by chemokine-independent interactions of selectins with counteradhesins. At inflamed sites, the leukocyte enters a second phase involving chemokine receptor engagement by specific chemokines that are immobilized on the endothelial surface by proteoglycans. Chemokine receptor activation in turn activates \u03b2 2 integrins, allowing leukocyte high-affinity binding to endothelial cell counterreceptors and subsequent extravasation 8 ( Figure 2 ).

Both CC and CXC subfamilies also contain T lymphocyte-specific members, and specific chemokine receptors mark T H 1 (CXCR3 and CCR5) vs T H 2 (CCR3 and CCR4) subsets \u275aFigure 3\u275a. The chemokine system is characterized by a high level of pleiotropism, with a given chemokine acting on different leukocyte populations. The sensitivity to the same chemoattractant allows the coordinated recruitment of different but functionally related leukocyte populations in specific immune responses. The chemokine system also is characterized by considerable redundancy. Some monogamous signaling units exist, such as CXCL12 and CXCR4, but in general a given receptor, in particular inflammatory chemokine receptors, recognizes more than a single chemokine, and a given chemokine usually binds to more than one receptor. Redundancy provides the molecular basis for robustness of the system, with alternative recruitment circuits being available to guarantee the final outcome. Since the description of the first chemokine in 1977, an impressive amount of information has been accumulated, correlating the chemokine system with the pathogenesis of different human diseases \u275aTable 1\u275a. One large group of disorders is represented by those with a prominent inflammatory component. 11, 12 A nonredundant role of CXCL8 in neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disease has been demonstrated by CXCL8 neutralization that results in almost complete protection from multiple inflammatory challenges, 13 by genetic deletion of CXCR2 that causes defective neutrophil recruitment \u275aTable 2\u275a, and more recently by pharmacologic inhibition of CXCR1. 51 Consistent with in vitro data, gene-targeted studies in mice also demonstrated the importance of CC inflammatory chemokines and respective receptors in monocyte recruitment.

Two models of exploitation have been identified. In a first scenario, pathogens interfere with the chemokine system by producing chemokine-binding molecules that inhibit their biologic activities, such as the M3 protein secreted by herpesvirus 68, or by pirating chemokines or chemokine receptors and modifying them to generate antagonists or chemokine scavengers. 52 Some pathogens produce multiple chemokine-related molecules affecting the host immune response in several ways. The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, also known as human herpesvirus 8, encodes a 7-transmembrane domain receptor known as open reading frame 74, highly related to the human CXCR2 but constitutively active (which exerts mitogenic and angiogenic activity in Kaposi sarcoma 53 ) , and 3 chemokinerelated molecules (v-macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]I, MIPII and MIPIII) that act on CCR3 and CCR4 and support T H 2 recruitment, allowing tumors to escape the immune response. 54 A second mechanism used by intracellular pathogens is represented by exploitation of cellular receptors for cell entry. A first example of such a mechanism is represented by the malaria-causing protozoan Plasmodium vivax, which enters erythrocytes by using a chemokine promiscuous receptor called Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines. 55 A second example is HIV-1, which gains access to immune cells using CD4 as a primary cellular receptor and a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, as strain-specific coreceptors. 56 A variety of blocking agents, including agonists, antagonists, and antibodies, clearly have demonstrated a nonredundant role for CCR5 and CXCR4 in HIV infection. Moreover, a clear-cut role for CCR5 also has been demonstrated through the discovery that a mutant allele bearing a 32-base-pair deletion in the open reading frame (CCR5-\u220632), which encodes a truncated and inactive receptor not translocated to the membrane surface, is highly protective against initial infection in CCR5-\u220632 homozygotes \u275aTable 3\u275a.
