T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of his thighs showed diffuse intramuscular edema and enhancement, compatible with myositis. A skin biopsy was most consistent with erythema multiforme. The muscle biopsy was normal without evidence of inflammatory infiltrates or immune complex deposition in vessels. During hospitalization, the patient was treated with 1,000 mg IV Solu-Medrol for 3 days for presumed inflammatory myositis with transition to 1 mg/kg oral prednisone with taper after biopsy results returned. His weakness and pain improved, and he was discharged home with the diagnosis of acute mononucleosis with possible TMP-SMX drug reaction. On outpatient follow-up, the rash and weakness resolved and the CK was normalized to 160 U/L.",

            "text": "DM is one of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), and classically presents with elevated serum muscle enzymes, proximal muscle weakness, and a characteristic rash. Muscle weakness is typically progressive and symmetrical with mild pain. Rashes highly specific for DM include the heliotrope rash, the shawl sign, and Gottron's sign. 1, 2 Skin involvement often includes sun-exposed areas of the face, scalp, neck, upper back, and extensor surfaces. Other skin lesions include periungual telangiectasias, alopecia, vesiculobullous lesions, panniculitis, urticaria, and mechanic's hands. A classic presentation may not require further testing; however, electromyography and muscle biopsy may assist in diagnosis. 1 Muscle biopsy for DM classically includes a perivascular infiltrate consisting predominantly of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Muscle involvement may be patchy and a magnetic resonance imaging can guide an optimal biopsy site. During the workup for an IIM, a broad differential including metabolic myopathies (acquired and genetic), motor neuron diseases, muscular dystrophies, and exposures to medications or infections should be considered. When weakness is accompanied by severe muscle pain, this is often suggestive of an infectious or a drugrelated process. 1 Infections associated with myositis include viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi (Table I) . Viruses and parasites commonly present with diffuse myositis although bacteria are more often associated with focal muscle symptoms. Fungal muscle invasion is uncommon and described in case reports. Parasitic infections are rare in the United States, but should be considered in a returning traveler. Viruses are the most common cause of myositis. Viral myositis should be considered when a patient presents with a typical viral prodrome of fevers, headache, sore throat, or rhinorrhea. The myalgias are often diffuse and may be a presenting symptom. 3 Influenza is the most common viral cause. Other viruses frequently associated with myositis include enterovirus, HIV, and hepatitis B and C. 3 EBV infection mimicking myositis is rare and when reported has been associated with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) infection. 4 Uchiyama et al 4 presented a case series of CAEBV patients with weakness of the extremities and elevated CKs. Six of the eight CAEBV patients also developed lingual or orbital muscle involvement, which is rare in IIM and may help in distinguishing the two diagnoses. Acute EBV infection associated with elevated CKs and muscle pain has been described in cases of rhabdomyolysis, 5-8 but is uncommon. Myoglobinuria and elevated CK are the hallmarks of rhabdomyolysis, and in the reported cases of EBV-associated rhabdomyolysis both were documented. Medications may be associated with musculoskeletal complaints ranging from mild myalgias to severe myositis or rhabdomyolysis. 9,10 Lipid-lowering medications, such as statins and fibrates, are often associated with myopathies, in part because of the high frequency in which they are prescribed. Rheumatological medications that cause myositis or myopathy include antitumor necrosis factor therapy, corticosteroids, colchicine, and chloroquines. Other classes of medications implicated include antiarrhythmic and chemotherapeutic agents, psychiatric medications, antiviral agents, and antibiotics including antimalarial medications that are often prescribed to deployed soldiers 10 (Table II) . Realistically, all medications should be considered if the onset of symptoms is temporally related to initiation of a medication.",

When TMP-SMX has been linked with rhabdomyolysis, it has been in patients who are immunocompromised and most commonly have HIV or AIDS. [11] [12] [13] The onset of symptoms can present up to 14 days after initiation. Muscle pain and elevated CKs are often accompanied by fevers and rash. Symptoms resolve after withdrawal of TMP-SMX. 12 In this case, it is plausible that an acute viral infection and administration of TMP-SMX resulted in myositis. Drug reactions associated with administration of amoxicillin in patients with acute EBV infection are well established, and underlying viral infections are associated with an increased risk of drug reactions. 14,15 A possible mechanism of TMP-SMX hypersensitivity in HIV patients was recently described by a polymorphism in glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. 16 A similar mechanism could be responsible for the findings in our patient.",
