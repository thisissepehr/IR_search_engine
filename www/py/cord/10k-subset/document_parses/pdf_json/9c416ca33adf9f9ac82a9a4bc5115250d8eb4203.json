            "text": "Turnip crinkle virus contains a T-shaped, ribosome-binding, translation enhancer (TSS) in its 3'UTR that serves as a hub for interactions throughout the region. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/\u00c9 3 required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/\u00c9 3 was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg 2+ . SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg 2+ , showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3'UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/ \u00c9 3 , leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication.",

Driven by conformational plasticity, RNA elements can assume alternative forms required for different biological functions (Dethoff et al., 2012; Simon and Gehrke, 2009) . For example, riboswitches in untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial genes can cycle between active and inactive conformations through binding to small metabolites, thereby inhibiting translation or attenuating transcription of downstream genes (Soukup and Soukup, 2004; Winkler and Breaker, 2003) . Regulatory RNA elements found in viral RNA genomes can also switch between mutually exclusive conformations to regulate incompatible processes such as translation and replication (D'Souza and Summers, 2004; Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Patel et al., 2015; Simon and Gehrke, 2009; Stammler et al., 2011; Stupina et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009) .",

TCV is a positive-strand RNA virus (genus Carmovirus, family Tombusviridae) with a single uncapped, non-poly(A) genome of 4053 nt encoding five proteins (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). The TCV 3'UTR contains at least five hairpins (H4, H4a, H4b, H5 and Pr) and three critical H-type pseudoknots (\u00c9 1 , \u00c9 2 , \u00c9 3 ) Simon and Miller, 2013) , a type of RNA structure that forms when loop residues in a hairpin pair with nearby residues to create a second stem-loop. The coaxially stacked double pseudoknots H4a/\u00c9 3 and H4b/\u00c9 2 in conjunction with hairpin H5 fold into a T-shaped structure known as the TSS (McCormack et al., 2008) . The TSS serves as a 3'CITE by binding to 80S ribosomes at the P-site through an interaction with the 60S ribosomal subunit (Stupina et al., 2008) . Substituting the entire TSS or H4a/\u00c9 3 /H4b with the analogous regions from the related Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus (CCFV) led to viral genomic (g)RNA accumulation that was similar to or greater than wild-type (wt) TCV. In contrast, TCV gRNA accumulated poorly when individual hairpins or other combinations of CCFV hairpins and pseudoknots were substituted. These results suggested that all, or a specific subset of hairpins and pseudoknots, function as a structural domain or subdomain .",

Prominent changes included enhanced flexibility of: (1) hairpin H3 in the coat protein ORF and adjacent upstream sequences; (2) the terminal loop of hairpin H4 located just upstream of the TSS; and (3) H4a/\u00c9 3 in the TSS. Sequences with reduced flexibility included: (1) the 5' side of the basal stem of H5; (2) the sequence between H4b and H5; and (3) the A-rich sequence upstream of H4a. These findings suggested that a mechanism exists for the TSS to transition between conformations required for translation and replication after a threshold level of RdRp was available.",

For this current report, optical tweezers (OT), a type of single molecule force spectroscopy, and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD) were used to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the TSS. Our results indicate that the TSS follows an unexpected folding pathway that can be reproduced by SMD for conditions that exclude Mg 2+ . In the absence of Mg 2+ , H4b unfolded first, followed by H5 and then H4a/\u00c9 3 , which had been predicted to be the least stable element. In the presence of Mg 2+ , H4b unfolded cooperatively with H5, followed by H4a/\u00c9 3 . Mg 2+ was not required to form H4a/\u00c9 3 but enhanced the stability of H4a/\u00c9 3 and all other elements tested. Disrupting H4a/\u00c9 3 eliminated the cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5, and H4a/\u00c9 3 was unstable in the absence of the upstream stretch of five adenylates. Mutating two of these adenylates or adjacent downstream residues eliminated specific binding of RdRp to a 3'UTR fragment, suggesting a model where binding of the RdRp to the five adenylate region disrupts H4a/\u00c9 3 , leading to loss of interaction between H5 and H4b and promoting the conformational switch that interrupts translation and promotes replication.",

            "text": "The TSS includes the upstream adjacent adenylates A 118 nt fragment (positions 3899 to 4016 in TCV gRNA), which includes the TSS along with 15 upstream residues and eight downstream residues, was previously used to analyze ribosome binding to the TSS (Stupina et al., 2008 ) ( Figure 1A) . A truncated version of this fragment that terminated precisely at the two pseudoknots and omitted the upstream five adenylates (5A) (positions 11 to 110 in Figure 1A ) was subsequently used to determine the TSS structure by NMR and SAXS (Zuo et al., 2010) . This shorter fragment was not initially stable, and stability required addition of two guanylates at the 5' end that extended \u00c9 3 and disrupted hairpin H4a. One possibility for why the TSS-only fragment was not stable was the omission of the upstream 5A, as it was subsequently shown that adjacent doublet mutations in 5A (positions 8 and 9 in Figure 1A ) or single mutations disrupting \u00c9 3 caused identical enhancements in flexibility of residues throughout the 5A/H4a/\u00c9 3 region as assayed Hairpins H4a, H4b and H5 and tertiary interactions \u00c9 2 and \u00c9 3 comprise the TSS. Tertiary interactions between underlined residues are indicated by hatched arrows. Predicted contour lengths of hairpins are in brackets. Residues in green and red are moderately and highly susceptible to in-line cleavages, respectively (see C and D). Residues in grey were not evaluated. The 5A region is boxed. Green and red circles denote residues with >25% reduction or enhancement in levels of cleavage, respectively, when 5A is altered to 5U. (B) Accumulation of full-length wt and mutant TCV gRNA in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Individual adenylates were converted to the bases indicated. Data is from three independent experiments and standard deviation is shown. (C) In-line probing of the wt and 5AtoU TSS118 fragments. OH, partial hydroxide cleavage ladder; T1, partial RNase T1 digest of denatured RNA showing the location of guanylates; wt and 5AtoU control lanes were not subjected to in-line cleavage. Intensity of the in-line cleavage products correlates with flexibility of the residues. (D) Longer run of the samples shown in (C). (E) Model of TCV118 corresponding to a 25 ns state in a 40 ns-long MD trajectory. 5' end C 6 and A 7 through A 9 form stable Hoogsteen edge interactions with \u00c9 3 . All 3' end nucleotides beyond G 110 remain single stranded. A fragment of this model (TSS108), comprising C 5 through A 112 , was used as the starting point for all Steered Molecular Dynamics pulling simulations ( Figure 8 and by in-line structure probing (Yuan et al., 2009) . For this reason, the longer 118 nt fragment (TSS118) that included 5A was used for most of the current study. Dinucleotide alterations made step-wise throughout 5A were previously shown to be equally detrimental to TCV fitness, with each mutant gRNA accumulating to less than 5% of wt levels in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts (Yuan et al., 2009) . To define the importance of individual adenylates, each was mutated to one or two other nucleotides and mutant gRNAs were assayed for accumulation in protoplasts. Alterations of individual adenylates reduced gRNA levels to between 23% and 55% of wt ( Figure 1B) . Since A 11 could potentially participate in \u00c9 3 by pairing with U 26 , it was altered to both a cytidylate, which should disrupt the base-pair and a guanylate, which might maintain the pairing with a G:U pair. A 11 toC was among the least detrimental of the single nucleotide alterations, reducing accumulation by 45% whereas A 11 toG reduced accumulation by 65%. These results suggest that the reduction in gRNA accumulation due to alteration of A 11 is not connected to its involvement (if any) with \u00c9 3 .",

To insure that the structure of the TSS within TSS118 was consistent with its structure in longer fragments, TSS118 was 3' end labelled and the RNA subjected to in-line structure probing. In-line probing reports on the flexibility of individual residues since nucleophilic attack of a ribose 2'OH on the backbone phosphate and ensuing backbone cleavage requires residue flexibility to assume in-line geometry (Soukup and Breaker, 1999) . As shown in Figures 1A,C and D, flexible residues were mainly found in TSS terminal and internal loops. \u00c9 3 , which was originally identified by generating several different compensatory mutations in full-length gRNA, was not resolved by in-line probing of TSS118, similar to what was previously found when subjecting larger fragments to in-line probing and full-length gRNA to SHAPE structure probing (Chattopadhyay et al., 2015; McCormack et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009) .",

As shown in Figures 1C and D, and quantified in Figure 1F , selected residues in the 5A region and surrounding sequences of 5AtoU, as well as residues within the H4a loop, displayed flexibility differences of >25% compared with wt. This result is similar to what was found previously when only two adenylates (positions 8 and 9) were mutated within a larger fragment (Yuan et al., 2009 ). In addition, several residues within the large symmetrical loop of H5 and one residue in the linker between H4b and H5 displayed >25% altered flexibility in 5AtoU. Although the 5U in 5AtoU could potentially pair with the five adenylates within the H5 internal loop, only one of the H5 adenylates displayed reduced flexibility, suggesting that structural changes in H5 were not due to an inadvertent pairing opportunity. These results suggest that the TSS forms a similar structure within TSS118 as previously found in longer fragments Yuan et al., 2009) and that 5A appears to be involved in stabilizing the structure of (at least) H4a/\u00c9 3 .",

To investigate this further, we examined the unfolding/folding behavior and stability (i.e., resistance to pulling force) of single TSS molecules under the induction of force using optical tweezers, a form of single molecule force spectroscopy that can be used to investigate conformational changes in single RNAs (Green et al., 2008; Greenleaf et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Liphardt et al., 2001; Ritchie and Woodside, 2015) . TSS118 was joined to 500-nt RNA handles at its 5' and 3' ends, which were made double stranded after hybridization to complementary DNA tagged with biotin or digoxigenin (DIG). The biotin DNA handle was attached to a streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead and the DIG DNA handle was attached to an anti-digoxigenin (AD)-coated bead. The streptavidin bead was held in place by a micropipette fixed on a glass chamber and the AD bead was held in an optical trap, which allowed the location of the focal point of the trap to be moved by a piezo (Figure 2 -figure supplement 1). By moving the focal point of the optical trap mechanically, the AD bead was pulled away from the pipette, allowing the connected single-stranded TSS to unfold. Alternatively, the AD bead in the optical trap was repositioned proximal to the pipette, leading to TSS refolding Vilfan et al., 2007) . This non-equilibrium measurement is known as force ramping.",

In the absence of Mg 2+ , the TSS was expected to unfold with three transitions, corresponding to hairpins H4a, H4b, and H5. At low force (<10 pN), the force-extension curve (FEC) showed monotonic extension of the DNA/RNA handles ( Figure 2A and Figure 2 -figure supplement 2), indicating that a single molecule was being stretched. At higher force, three transitions (termed 'rips') labeled '1', '2', and '3' appeared in stepwise fashion, corresponding to successive unfolding of three TSS structural elements ( Figure 2A , red line). No rips were observed when the force exceeded 20 pN (data not shown). When the force was released, the TSS refolded in three successive steps corresponding to its three unfolding transitions (3, 2, and 1; Figure 2A , blue line). Differences in the force required to unfold and fold the individual elements signified hysteric characteristics of the two processes due to the slow unfolding/folding rate of the molecule as compared to the fast loading rate of the applied force, suggesting that these transitions were taking place outside of their thermal equilibrium.",

The predicted DG's (in kcals/mole) were H4a: \u00c06.9; H4b: \u00c09.2; H5: \u00c021.8; H4a/\u00c9 3 : \u00c08.3; and H4b/\u00c9 2 : \u00c011.0. Since the dynamic unfolding behaviors of RNA hairpins and pseudoknots also depend on kinetic barriers to unfolding force, rip assignments required using complementary oligonucleotides to disrupt individual hairpins. In the absence of Mg 2+ , disrupting H4b eliminated rip 1 ( Figure 2C ), and disrupting H5 eliminated rip 2 ( Figure 2D ). In the presence of Mg 2+ , disrupting either H4b or H5 resulted in FECs without rip 1*. Rips 2 and 3 were present when H4b was disrupted and rips 1 and 3 were present when H5 was disrupted. These results strongly suggest: (1) in the absence of Mg 2+ , rip 1 and rip 2 correspond to unfolding of H4b and H5, respectively; and (2) in the presence of Mg 2+ , H4b and H5 unfold cooperatively as rip 1*, which may also contain \u00c9 2 that connects H4b with the base of H5.",

When mH4a was subjected to OT in the presence and absence of Mg 2+ , rip 3 (the most stable transition) was eliminated ( Figure 2F ). This suggests that the unusual stability of H4a/\u00c9 3 (compared to its predicted value) in the presence or absence of Mg 2+ precluded oligonucleotide annealing. Since rip 3 was present in the absence of Mg 2+ (Figure 2A ), Mg 2+ was not required for H4a/\u00c9 3 folding, similar to the ribosome recoding pseudoknot of Barley western yellows virus (BWYV) (Grilley et al., 2006) .

To determine if the enhanced stability of H4a/\u00c9 3 requires additional elements such as 5A, the folding pathway of H4a/\u00c9 3 was determined using a truncated fragment (positions 1 to 37) composed of H4a/\u00c9 3 , 5A, and additional flanking residues on both ends to reduce disturbance of handles on H4a/\u00c9 3 structure ( Figure 3A , left). A single H4a/\u00c9 3 transition was observed in 10 mM Mg 2+ near the position of rip 3 ( Figure 3B , left), suggesting that H4a/\u00c9 3 can form in the absence of H4b and H5. The critical force required to unfold H4a/\u00c9 3 was 19.95 \u00b1 0.06 pN (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). In the absence of Mg 2+ and presence of 10 mM or 250 mM NaCl, the single rip was present at forces that were 4 to 5 pN lower ( Figure 3A , right; Figure 3 -figure supplement 2), suggesting that Mg 2+ enhances the stability of the folded structure, similar to what was found for the BWYV pseudoknot (Grilley et al., 2006) . Replacing 5A with 5U in the truncated fragment (fragment 5A5U) eliminated the H4a/\u00c9 3 rip in the presence ( Figure 3C ) and absence (data not shown) of Mg 2+ . Since no other transitions were observed, this result suggests that 5A is required to both form and stabilize H4a/\u00c9 3 . This result supports the in-line probing results showing that mutations in 5A disrupt H4a/\u00c9 3 , as evidenced by enhanced flexibility of residues in the region ( Figure 1 ) (Yuan et al., 2009 ).",

Slowly increasing the force extended the time the hairpins spent in the unfolded state. For example, H4b spent less than 20% of its time in an unfolded state at 11.5 pN, 96% of the time at 13 pN and 100% at 14 pN and higher. Mg 2+ increased the mechanical stability of all TSS elements, with H4b now unfolding between 13 and 16.5 pN; H5 from 14.5 to 17.5 pN; and H4a/\u00c9 3 from 16.5 to 18 pN ( Figure 4B ; the slightly higher unfolding force [19.95 \u00b1 0.06 pN] of H4a/ \u00c9 3 obtained by force ramping might be due to the effect of the force loading rate [ Figure 3 -figure supplement 2]). In addition, cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5 was only observed in the presence of Mg 2+ (hops labeled with asterisks in Figure 4B and not observed in Figure 4A ). Mg 2+ also caused abrupt changes in the hopping behavior of H4b and H4a/\u00c9 3 . The unfolded state for H4b was less than 1% of the total time at 15 pN, changing to 40% at 15.5 pN, and was nearly 100% at 16 pN ( Figure 4B ). For H4a/\u00c9 3 in Mg 2+ , the unfolded state was less than 1% of the total time at 17.5 pN and 100% of total time at 18 pN ( Figure 3B ). These results show that unfolding of H4b and H4a/\u00c9 3 in Mg 2+ reflects brittle behavior, meaning that in the presence of Mg 2+ , the distance from the unfolded state of these elements is much closer to their transition states.",

            "text": "5A is implicated in RdRp binding to a 3' end fragment As described above, the 3' region of the TCV gRNA adopts an alternative conformation upon binding to the RdRp, which significantly affects the structure of the TSS and other nearby elements (Yuan et al., 2010 (Yuan et al., , 2009 . Since the TSS is a central hub for RNA interactions within the 3'UTR and upstream sequences (Yuan et al., 2012) , it seemed possible that the widespread conformational rearrangement could be triggered by RdRp binding to, and disrupting, the TSS. One consequence of RdRp binding to fragments containing the TSS was reduced flexibility of 5A residues, suggesting Figure 2F ). '\u00c9 2 ' may represent unfolding of \u00c9 2 and the first few bases of the H4b stem. Asterisks denote cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5. Note that fewer cooperative H4b +H5 unfolding events are observed when compared with wt TSS at the same force level in the presence of Mg 2+ (see Figure 4B ). that this motif might be a target site for the RdRp (Yuan et al., 2009) . To assess the validity of this hypothesis, RdRp filter binding assays were conducted on an extended 3' fragment (positions 3858 to 4053) to determine if binding dissociation constants were affected by mutations in 5A. Recombinant TCV RdRp bound to the wt fragment with a K d = 2.6 mM (Figure 7) . In contrast, RdRp did not exhibit specific one-site binding to MDV (midivariant RNA, 221 nt), which is a non-template satellite RNA associated with Qb bacteriophage. A two nucleotide mutation in 5A at positions 8 and 9 (A to U; m74) prevented specific binding of RdRp to the fragment. Loss of specific binding supports our previous finding that m74 also reduced RdRp-directed in vitro transcription of this fragment by 3.6fold (Yuan et al., 2009) . The ability of the RdRp to continue transcribing low levels of complementary strands in the absence of 5A binding is likely due to the presence of the 3' terminal Pr hairpin, which in combination with upstream hairpin H4 can promote a low level of transcription (Sun and Simon, 2006) . Since mutations in 5A disrupt the stability of H4a/\u00c9 3, RNA fragments were also examined that contained mutations in \u00c9 3 . Two individual alterations in the loop of H4a (m27, m41) improved binding of the RdRp to the template by 2.5-fold. In contrast, mutations in the two partner residues of m27 and m41 located just downstream of 5A (m26, m40) eliminated one-site binding to the template (Figure 7) . These results suggest that disruption of H4a/\u00c9 3 (which occurs when the adenylates are altered in m74) is not the proximal cause of the loss of specific RdRp binding, but rather the RdRp may be specifically interacting with 5A and adjacent downstream sequences, and this interaction may be facilitated by the absence of \u00c9 3 . Since specific binding was lost when residues just downstream of the 5A sequence were altered, we investigated whether binding might extend into upstream hairpin H4, which is known to be critical for TCV accumulation (Yuan et al., 2009 (Yuan et al., , 2012 . Deletion of H4 (DH4) had no significant effect on RdRp binding, suggesting that the binding region may be confined to the sequence between H4 and H4a.",

Therefore, computationally much faster MD method using the implicit solvent Generalized Born model (GB) was employed to explore an order of magnitude slower simulated pulling speeds. Both types of simulations used explicit or simulated concentration of monovalent Na + /Cl \u00c0 counter ions. Mg 2+ ions were not included as their initial placement is unknown. Furthermore, the additional level of complexity introduced by the SMD protocol would not allow sufficient time for the potential coordinating effects of Mg 2+ to be established, and thus their inclusion was deemed insufficiently accurate for use in this study. Therefore, all simulation results are based on NaCl and are compared to experimental conditions in the absence of Mg 2+ .",

Full base-pair opening for the extension of the 5' and 3' ends could be achieved by an additional equilibration step at the end of these simulations (i.e., with holding to maintain the extension, but without pulling) or by slowing down the pulling speed to 0.1 \u00c5 /ps. These runs yielded an unfolding sequence different from the experimental results, even at the 0.05 \u00c5 /ps pulling speed (resulting in the longest practical explicit solvent simulation times). The key observation based on these simulations was that pulling speed affected the orientation of helices relative to the direction of pulling (refer to Appendix 1 for more details). This led to formation of new, transient tertiary interactions by H4b after all hydrogen bonds between H4b and \u00c9 2 opened, increasing the resistance to pulling and impacting the order of TSS unfolding. These observations are consistent with results of OT unfolding of a pseudoknot (Chen et al., 2007) .

In 70% to 100% of the SMD simulations (depending on the parameters used) with a constant pulling speed of 0.01 \u00c5 /ps, H4a/\u00c9 3 opened last, and in 40% to 50% of all the simulations, the full sequence of events was in agreement with the experimental OT results (H4b opening first, H5 second, and H4a/\u00c9 3 last).

In addition, as was the case in the majority of the explicit solvent simulations at higher pulling speeds, in the few implicit solvent simulations in which H4b opened last, strong tertiary interactions occurred between H4b loop residues and other nucleotides after the original base pairs involved in \u00c9 2 opened. The resulting tertiary structure was oriented approximately in parallel with the direction of pulling. Even though topologically it is a pseudoknot, at the 5' end of the opening H4b was pulled through a loop (as if it was a true knot in 3D; Figure 8 -figure supplement 1) that increased the number of opportunistic interactions and resulted in more resistance to pulling than H4a/\u00c9 3, which is not 'knotted'.

Unfolding begins with C 6 and 5A adenylates losing their initial triple interactions with \u00c9 3 and the extended pairing in \u00c9 3 (A 11 ). Next, the stacking between H4a and H4b is opened (C 34 and G 35 are pulled apart). This is followed by \u00c9 2 opening and H4b pivoting toward vertical (perpendicular to the direction of pulling) without forming any transitional tertiary interactions and unwinding fully as the first of the major TCV TSS helices. In the next stage, the entire H5 opens. Finally, H4a/\u00c9 3 opens with H4a helix pairs opening from the 5'\u00c03' end toward the hairpin. The illustrated simulation exhibited separation of H4b from pseudoknot \u00c9 2 without any transient tertiary interactions, and this clean transition appears to contribute to the clearly defined sequence of events. The individual helices open sequentially, one at a time, rather than partially and in parallel (concurrently). The latter scenario was observed in many SMD simulations at all pulling speeds, although it was most pronounced at faster pulling speeds. For example, rather than 'waiting for its turn' to begin opening, H4a/\u00c9 3 opens its 5'\u00c03' base pair or pairs and pauses as weaker base pairs open elsewhere in the TCV. Gradual changes in the hydrogen-bond interactions that maintain the pseudoknotted 3D topology of the 5' end are similar to the case of H4b 'slipping' (see Appendix 1). This scenario could explain the difference between estimated (13.6 nm) and experimental (9.1 \u00b1 1.5 nm) contour length of H4a/\u00c9 3 , which would not include any 'premature' base pair openings. In multiple runs, we observed partial opening of H4a/\u00c9 3 foreshortening the contour length, first to 11.2 nm (C 12 through G 30 or G 13 through C 31 ), and then to 9.4 nm (U 15 through G 30 ), after which the remaining structure opened rapidly. Similar foreshortening of the contour length was also observed for the opening simulations of H5. A pause in unzipping is predicted for the substructure between C 71 and G 100 , followed by a rapid opening of H5, especially across the non-canonical pairing in its large internal loop. The contour length of this substructure is 17.7 nm, well within the experimental measurements. The experimentally obtained FECs indicate rapid opening (unzipping) of entire helices, one helix at a time, while our simulations include both scenarios and suggest that partial helix opening may play a role in the process.",

How the TSS along with at least 300 nt at the 3' end of the TCV gRNA convert between the two conformations is unknown. In the T-shaped structure, the TSS contains hairpin H5 in conjunction with the coaxially stacked pseudoknots H4a/\u00c9 3 and H4b/\u00c9 2 . Based on Mfold-predicted DG's for the three TSS hairpins, H4a (in the absence of the pseudoknot) should be the least stable element (DG = \u00c06.9 kcal/mol), followed by H4b (DG = \u00c09.2 kcal/mol), and H5 (DG = \u00c021.8 kcal/mol). In the absence of Mg 2+ , H4b unfolded experimentally between 10 and 13.5 pN, and H5 unfolded between 13 and 15.5 pN (Figures 2 and 4) . In addition to H5 being substantially less stable than expected, it also has a smaller than expected contour length (15 to 17 nm compared with the expected length of 25 nm). Reduced stability of H5 may reflect instability of its lower stem (~5.9 nm) , which might unfold at a lower force range, as suggested by SMD. In the absence of the lower stem, the DG of H5 is predicted to be \u00c014.9 kcal/mol. No rip corresponding to H4a alone was found, either in TSS118 (Figure 2) or when alone in a truncated fragment (Figure 3-figure supplement 1) , suggesting either that H4a does not form independently or that its unfolding is obscured by the unfolding of the DNA/RNA handles. In the presence of upstream sequences, including 5A and sequences that form \u00c9 3 , H4a/\u00c9 3 is the most stable TSS element and folding is independent of Mg 2+ (Figures 2 and 3) . High force was also necessary to unfold the human telomerase pseudoknot (Chen et al., 2007) . Stability of H4a/\u00c9 3 was dependent upon association with the upstream 5A as the element did not form when the adenylates were converted to uridylates ( Figure 3C ). 5AtoU also caused structural changes in H4a/\u00c9 3 residues (Figure 1) , similar to what was previously found when just A 9 and A 10 were altered, or \u00c9 3 was disrupted (Yuan et al., 2009) . The importance of 5A for TSS structure is consistent with previous findings that 5AtoU decreased ribosome binding and translational efficiency in luciferase reporter constructs (Stupina et al., 2008) .",

It is therefore possible that interactions other than those proposed in the model and that are stable in MD simulations form between 5A and H4a/\u00c9 3. H4a/\u00c9 3 may also be highly stable due to its coaxially stacked stems, creating base-pair planes perpendicular to the direction of the unfolding force requiring high force to overcome resistance of multiple base pairs at the same time. Computer simulations of the unfolding pathway support this hypothesis by indicating that the structural resistance to pulling is increased for the TSS pseudoknotted motifs beyond their free energy predictions by their orientation parallel (and nearly co-axial) to the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS's 'T' shape). Of the two pseudoknots, the long-distance \u00c9 2 is weaker than the short-distance H-type \u00c9 3 and opens first, exposing H4b and H5, now oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction of pulling. H4b is shorter (and has a higher predicted free energy) and opens first, followed by H5. Beside the alignment between the motif axis and the direction of pulling, akin to 'static resistance', we observed what could be labeled as 'kinetic resistance' based on the formation of transient ('slipping') tertiary interaction between the helices oriented (initially or transiently) along the direction of pulling and in the proximity of other (downstream or upstream) parts of the TSS. For example, \u00c9 3 opens gradually and, as the entire \u00c9 3 motif opens, transient tertiary interactions outside of the original \u00c9 3 base pairs maintain the pseudoknot topology, thus increasing the resistance to pulling and delaying the opening of H4a/\u00c9 3 .",

In Mg 2+ , cooperative association of H5 and H4b led to a new large rip in the FECs (1*), which unfolded at a lower force than H4a/\u00c9 3 ( Figure 2B ). In addition, stability of all three TSS transitions increased by 2 to 3 pN over the force required in the absence of Mg 2+ (Figures 4 and 6) , and fully stretched H4a/\u00c9 3 (13 nm) was only obtained in Mg 2+ at high force (!18 pN) ( Figure 5) .

For example, disruption of either H4b or H5 led to the disappearance of rip 1* ( Figures 2C and D) , indicating cooperative unfolding of the two hairpins. Furthermore, disruption of H5 caused H4b to unfold at 11.5 pN in the presence of Mg 2+ ( Figure 6B) , which was the same force level as in the absence of Mg 2+ . In addition, alterations that disrupted H4a/\u00c9 3 (mH4a) converted rip 1* to the individual H4b and H5 rips (rips 1 and 2; Figure 2F ), indicating that H4b/H5 cooperation required H4a/\u00c9 3 . A connection between H5 and H4b was also previously suggested by finding second-site mutations in H4b when the lower bulge loop of H5 was mutated (McCormack, 2007) . Although FECs indicated that H4a/\u00c9 3 was stable in the absence of H5 or H4b ( Figures 2C and D and Figure 3) , disruption of H5 eliminated the normal H4a/\u00c9 3 transition in the absence of Mg 2+ ( Figure 6B ).",

We propose that a basal conformation of the 3'UTR contains the TSS, which serves as a 3'CITE for translation of the RdRp from the gRNA template when the gRNA first enters a cell. When a threshold level of RdRp has been synthesized, the RdRp binds to the 5A region that includes \u00c9 3 residues, disrupting H4a/\u00c9 3 , which consequently disrupts the interaction between H4b and H5. Since the TSS serves as a central hub for interactions throughout the region (Yuan et al., 2012) , disruption of the TSS would likely cause additional structural changes leading to the alternative conformation of the RNA that is found upon RdRp binding. Although this site of RdRp binding is distal to the 3'end where transcription commences, previous results indicated that a structural connection exists between the 3' terminus and the 5A region (Yuan et al., 2012) , which could place the 3' end in a position to be accessed by the 5A-bound RdRp. We believe that this scenario provides an intriguing blueprint for possible RNA structural transitions in other viruses with 3' translation elements.",

The much smaller size of the simulated system also permitted the use of the fast Amber PMEMD module. The GB-based SMD simulations were performed with constant pulling speeds of 0.01 \u00c5 /ps and 0.005 \u00c5 /ps, with three variants of intrinsic Born radii parameters: GB (mbondi, igb = 1), GB-HCT (mbondi, offset = 0.13 \u00c5 , igb = 1) (Gaillard and Case, 2011; Hawkins et al., 1995; Tsui and Case, 2000a ) and the latest GB-neck2 (mbondi3, igb = 8) (Nguyen et al., 2015) .

Following this event, the SMD was run for one ns with the TCV TSS ends held at a constant distance (~215 \u00c5 ) to re-equilibrate the system. During this time, the H4b terminal loop adenylates maintained H-bond contacts with the H4b-H5 linker uridylates, but changed their horizontal orientation to point further away (closer to the perpendicular) from the direction of pulling. After the pause in pulling, the SMD at 0.05 \u00c5 /ps was resumed until the full extension of 700 \u00c5 was reached. Even though the re-equilibration pause did not lead to immediate full separation of the H4b from the rest of the structure and did not prevent the transient alternative tertiary interaction from forming, the global sequence of structure opening events changed to H4b opening first, H5 opening second and H4a opening last.

            "text": "The TCV TSS model including all 118 nucleotides of TSS118 was subjected to explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in Amber (Case et al., 2014) which indicated a potential placement of the 5' end residues A7 through A10 in the major groove of \u00c9 3 (see Figure 1E ).A 108 nt-long fragment of the above model between nucleotides C5 and A112 (inclusively) was selected for the Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations because it contained all the TCV TSS stable interactions and limited the maximum single-stranded chain extension length, an important factor in explicit solvent simulations (see below). Heavy atoms C5:O5' and A112:O3' were selected to determine the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS 'T') and the distance restraint parameters were applied to them.OT experiments were performed at pulling speeds that were orders of magnitude slower than our simulations (due to the total computer time required to perform one simulation). Thus, we first assessed the impact of several SMD pulling speeds on the predicted unfolding sequence of events and ran the pulling simulations at the slowest speeds practicable with the explicit, then implicit solvent approaches (see Materials and Methods). The most important finding was that pulling speed influences the orientation of helical regions relative to the direction of pulling, most importantly that of H4b, which, in turn, leads to formation of transient tertiary interactions that change the resistance to pulling and alter the sequence of opening of the key domains in the TSS model. Chen at al. previously observed that the parallel orientation of the helices of a pseudoknot to the direction of pulling (i.e. perpendicular orientation of their base pairs) increases the resistance because a shear force is applied to stems, rather than the unzipping force that opens base pairs one at a time (Chen et al., 2007) . Our results are consistent with theirs, but additionally indicate that the speed of pulling influences transient orientations of structural elements.The explicit solvent SMD simulations at a pulling speed of 1.0 \u00c5 /ps terminated with helices H5 and H4b remaining partly base-paired, while the 5' and 3' ends of the modeled TCV TSS fragment were pulled 700 \u00c5 apart, at which distance the chain should be totally singlestranded. The backbone of the single-stranded (opened) portion of the molecule was overstretched, with the straight-line P-to-P atom distances up to 33% above those found in a relaxed A-form helix. An additional 1.0 ns MD simulation was conducted with the ends held 700 \u00c5 apart to let the remaining base pairs open and the forces measured at the end to relax to zero. This was a clear indication that a pulling simulation at this speed keeps the TCV RNA away from (ahead of) its equilibrium state. At 0.5 \u00c5 /ps pulling speed, the simulation ended with less base paired structure, and only at 0.1 \u00c5 /ps pulling speed were all TSS base pairs open at the end of the simulation.Pulling speed also had an impact on the dynamics of the opening of individual TCV TSS helices. At the highest pulling speed, the H5 helix pivoted toward the horizontal (the direction of pulling), formed tertiary interactions with upstream nucleotides and acted like a pseudoknot, additionally increasing resistance to pulling. At all pulling speeds, after the opening of \u00c9 2 , H4b remained horizontally oriented and formed new transient tertiary interactions between the adenylates in the H4b terminal loop and the uridylates in the single-stranded linker between H4b and H5. These interactions formed a transient H-type pseudoknot and also increased the resistance to pulling. Such transient tertiary interactions that replaced the original pseudoknots or added new ones influenced the order of TSS unfolding, with H4a/\u00c9 3 opening first, in disagreement with the experimental OT results. Of the seven simulations run at 0.1 \u00c5 /ps (two with higher NaCl salt concentrations that did not change the results) only one run yielded a sequence of unfolding events ending with H4a/\u00c9 3",
