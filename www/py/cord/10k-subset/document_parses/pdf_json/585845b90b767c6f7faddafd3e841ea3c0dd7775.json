Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; 2 Institiute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Germany; 3 It is now realized that T cell immune surveillance of cancer occurs in many cases. One approach that has now been developed to deal with tolerance to tumors has been checkpoint blockade, which can enable the natural immune response to respond to antigens encountered in the tumor microenvironment. In this seminar I will outline recent results in the area of synthetic biology, which uses engineered T cells to overcome immune tolerance. There are three types of T cell therapy that are being actively tested in the clinic (1) . In one case tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are obtained from surgical biopsies. This therapy is most advanced in melanoma, and trials for patients with metastatic melanoma are currently underway with phase 3 trials in Europe. Gene transfer technologies can also be used to produce engineered T cell therapies. One approach is a chimeric antigen receptor or CAR T cell approach. Another is the use of engineered T cells that express T cell receptors of known specificity and affinity. There are number of considerations for successful T cell therapy with adoptively transferred T cells. It is necessary to have an adequate number of T cells in order to eradicate large numbers of tumor cells. If a kilogram of tumor represents approximately 1x10 12 T cell tumor cells, then it is likely that a similar number of T cells will be required for an equivalent effector to target ratio in vivo. The failure to achieve a critical mass of T cells numerically may explain many previous trials with disappointing results following therapeutic vaccines. There are two potential solutions to overcome inadequate effector T cell function in cancer patients with adopted cell transfer therapy. On the one hand it is possible to infuse very large numbers of T cells, as has been done in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte therapy 2) . The other approach is to infuse smaller numbers of cells that are programmed to expand extensively in the patient 3, 4) . There are three essential factors to consider when developing engineered T cell therapies (Fig1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 69, "end": 70, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 135, "end": 136, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 660, "end": 663, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1413, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1975, "end": 1977, "text": "2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2096, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2097, "end": 2099, "text": "4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "One issue under consideration is the nature of the lymphocyte subset to be infused.

More recently second and third generation CAR T cells have been designed, incorporating progressively more complicated signaling domains. A number of strategies have been used to make CARs more potent or to enhance their proliferative capacity or their cytokine secretion. For example it has been shown that so-called Signal 1 from the Lafferty model 6) can be enhanced by encoding a ubiquitin-resistant linker of activated T cells (LAT) 7) . A number of costimulatory domains have been used to augment Signal 2. These include CD28, and the tumor necrosis family members 4-1BB, Ox40, and CD27, for example. Recent studies have shown that the ICOS signaling domain, a molecule related to CD28, provides CAR T cells with enhanced persistence in preclinical animal models. These studies were initiated by Crystal Paulos and showed that when T cells were activated through their natural ICOS receptor molecule with agonistic antibodies, that this promoted the proliferation of TH 17 cells and T follicular helper cells that had highly potent effector functions (Fig 3) . In contrast, if the T cells were costimulated with a CD28 dominant costimulatory signal, then the TH17 cells were restrained in their antitumor activity and inflammatory properties 8) . More recently, Sonia Guedan has demonstrated that when ICOS is expressed in CD4 cells by encoding the cytosolic domain in the CAR endodomain that this leads to enhanced persistence of the CD4 cells and that those cells promote the persistence of CD8 CAR T cells 9) . This latter effect is independent of the costimulatory domain it is expressed in the CD8 CAR T cell. Other studies in our laboratory have recently identified examples of CAR designs that have either a continuous and ligand-independent growth phenotype, or are quiescent in the absence of stimulation by surrogate antigen. Finally, studies by Yangbing Zhou have recently shown that it is possible to increase the therapeutic index of CARs by affinity-tuning of the single chain variable fragments. Ongoing research is defining the characteristics of CAR design that lead to a continuously active CAR. These T cells are capable of proliferating for months without stimulation or addition of exogenous cytokines. Factors that dictate ligand independent growth of the CAR T cells depend on the particular scFv used, and so far they have only been observed with CD28 endodomains. The growth is independent of exogenous ligands and there is evidence for constitutive signaling through CD28 involving AKT, NF-kappaB and the MAP kinase pathway. The continuous CAR T cells have constitutive secretion of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, and they tend to highly express T-bet, Eomes, GATA3, and Bcl-xL. Transformation not observed, and surprisingly, CAR T cells with the continuous growth phenotype are less effective in pre-clinical tumor models. One implication of this research is that it is important to screen newly designed CAR T cells for constitutive activity. The initial CAR T cell trials were conducted in patients with HIV, using a first-generation CAR (10) . At the University of Pennsylvania CAR T cell trials in cancer patients targeting CD19 were initiated in 2010 11) . There were three unique aspects of this the CAR, termed CART19, that were used in this trial that have not been tested previously. First a lentiviral vector was used to express the CAR. Secondly, a short duration T cell culture process using antibody-coated beads was used for T cell manufacturing. Thirdly, the CAR employed a TNF family member for co-stimulation, CD1 37, also referred to as 4-1BB. The initial patients that were treated had refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia 12) . All three of the initial patients responded to the CART19 therapy. The patients had large bulky tumors and it was possible to conclude that each CART19 cell or its progeny through cell division killed more than 1000 tumor cells. As of December 2014 the patients continue to express the CARs and the remissions have been durable in two of the three patients having no evidence of leukemia for more than 4 years. The level of CAR T cell proliferation in vivo is a predictive biomarker of clinically beneficial antitumor responses. In more recent studies the CART19 T cell approach has been used to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 9ALL). We recently reported the first 30 patients on this phase 1 trial and a striking 90% rate of complete remission was observed in both pediatric and adult cases 13) . Updated results as of December 1, 2014 are shown in Fig4. Durable B cell aplasia is associated with a low risk of relapse of ALL following CART19 T cell therapy. There have been a number of toxicities associated with CAR T cell therapy. B cell aplasia is observed in responding patients following therapy with CD19 or CD20 specific CARs. Tumor lysis syndrome has been observed in many patients, and this is managed as per standard oncology practices and the unique aspect of this is that it may be delayed for 20 to 50 days after infusion of the CAR T cells. Cytokine release syndrome characterized initially with fever occurs in many patients, and this is related to the tumor burden in the patient. Finally, a subset of patients develops macrophage activation syndrome which is characterized in the serum by very high levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein and evidence of coagulopathy. The hallmark of this syndrome is very high levels of IL-6 and interferon gamma in the serum. This syndrome is rapidly reversed with the IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab, indicating that this inflammatory disorder is dependent on IL-6 (Fig5).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 495, "text": "6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 580, "end": 582, "text": "7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1392, "text": "8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1659, "text": "9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3211, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3323, "end": 3326, "text": "11)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3812, "end": 3815, "text": "12)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4628, "end": 4631, "text": "13)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1199, "end": 1206, "text": "(Fig 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Fig2: Design of CAR T Cells"}, {"text": ": Tocilizumab Anti-Cytokine Therapy for Cytokine Release Syndrome.

The proliferation of leukemia cells in and around the niche promotes a hypoxic environment that may metabolically favor LSC survival.

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether human cancellous bone chips could serve as scaffolding in a model using subcutaneous implantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), endothelial colony forming cells (ECFC), and matrigel, along with concomittant addition of bulk or FACS-sorted subpopulations of leukemia cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fig1"}, {"text": "Novel approaches to anti-CXCR4 therapy Identifying the elements linking leukemia cells and the microenvironment, and understanding those interactions mechanistically, is critical for disruption of leukemia resistance. One interaction that occurs between LSC and the bone marrow microenvironment is through C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4, or CD184) on the leukemic cell, and its attractant ligand C-X-C chemokine receptor 12 (CXCL12, or stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1, SDF-1) in the marrow niche (10) (11) (12) . Interestingly, the level of CXCR4 expression on AML cells correlates with worse outcomes (13, 14) . CXCR4/CXCL12 inhibition is a known mobilizer of marrow stem cells, and the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for mobilization of CD34+ cells prior to autologous stem cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma (15) . Inducing mobilization of LSC is a method that is also being used to treat leukemia. In pre-clinical in vivo leukemia models, inhibition of CXCR4 resulted in mobilization of leukemia into peripheral blood and subsequent sensitization to cytotoxic chemotherapy (16) . A recent phase 1 study demonstrated this same approach was useful in humans, where AML patients treated with plerixafor prior to chemotherapy demonstrated modest (two-fold) leukemia mobilization and increased sensitivity to a standard ara-C plus anthracycline regimen (17) . A more recent study used plerixafor plus G-CSF in the pre-allogeneic stem cell transplant setting for patients with myeloid malignancies (18) . Although outcomes were not superior compared to historical patients, efficient mobilization of leukemic clones occurred (18) . Other CXCR4 inhibitors are under development including a monoclonal antibody (PF-06747143) (19) , peptide inhibitors (BL-8040) (20) , and other small molecule inhibitors (such as LY2510924) (21) .

We have previously shown that that H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) by the enzyme Dot1L is required to maintain Hox gene expression and proliferation of MLL-rearranged leukemias. This has prompted the development of small molecules that are now in clinical trails. More recently we have studied the regulation of the Dot1L complex and identified the role of Dot1L in the control of gene expression. We find that H3K79me2 is converted to mono-methylation (H3K79me1) at critical Hox loci as cells transition from hematopoietic stem cell-enriched populations to myeloid progenitor cells thus coinciding with a decrease in Hox gene expression. Conversion of H3K79me1 to H3K79me2 is critical for continued expression of Hox genes in leukemia cells and H3K79me2 but not H3K79me1 is dependent on Af10, a core constituent of the Dot1l complex. Af10 loss of function reverses aberrant epigenetic profiles found in leukemia cells and dramatically impairs the transforming ability of MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6 or NUP98-NSD1 fusionsdiverse, mechanistically distinct oncogenes that drive abnormal Hox gene expression. Furthermore, NUP98-NSD1 transformed cells, much like those transformed by MLL-fusion proteins, are highly sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of Dot1l. Also, we have performed a genome scale RNAi screen and found that suppression of the histone deacetylase Sirt1 and histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 rescued MLL-rearranged leukemia cells from their dependence on Dot1L. We find that Sirt1 and Suv39h1 are required for the acquisition of a repressive chromatin state consistent with facultative heterochromatin around MLLfusion target genes after Dot1L inhibition. Epigenomic profiling revealed that Dot1L-dependent genes demonstrate an H3K9ac high /me2 low signature that is induced at MLL-AF9 bound loci. This signature is also normally found on a distinct set of Dot1L dependent genes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Finally, pharmacological activation of Sirt1 enhances the efficacy of Dot1L inhibitors against MLL-rearranged leukemia via more rapid and complete silencing of leukemogenic gene expression. These data show that the Dot1L complex is highly regulated in hematopoiesis and in leukemia. A major function of Dot1L is to inhibit Sirt1-mediated acquisition of a heterochromatic state to maintain leukemogenic gene expression, and to maintain specific gene expression programs during normal hematopoietic development. These mechanisms are being exploited therapeutically in ongoing clinical trials. [1, 2] .

In both pediatric and adult populations, T-ALLs are more frequently associated with a high whiteblood cell count (WBC), a mediastinal tumor mass and a cerebrospinal fluid involvement. Contrarily to what is observed in BCP-ALL, T-ALL are more frequently observed in adolescents and young adults, making patients with T-ALL younger in the whole adult population. Moreover, less heterogeneity in disease characteristics was reported between children and adults, even if unfavorable immature T-ALL seems to be more frequent in adults. 1 Even more than in BCP-ALL, patients with T-ALL benefit from pediatric-inspired approaches with complete remission (CR) rates >90%, relapse incidence around 30%, and approximately 55-60% event-free survival and 65% overall survival at 5 year. In most cooperative group, prognostication in T-ALL relies on initial WBC, phenotype, and response to induction therapy. A dismal prognosis has been reported for pro/pre-T (EGIL T-I and T-II) and mature T (EGIL T-IV) ALL compared to cortical T-ALL. The lack of CD1a and CD8 expression and the weak expression of CD5 define a subset of T-ALL, named \"early T-cell precursor\" ALL, that was associated with myeloidrelated molecular features and a higher risk of treatment failure. 2 In contrary to BCP-ALL, conventional cytogenetic analysis is uncommonly used for risk stratification in T-ALL. The presence of t(10;14)(q24;q11)/ TLX1 has been associated with a better prognosis, while the negative impact of t(10;11)(p12;q14)/PICALM-MLLT10 (formerly CALM-AF10) has been discussed. Complex karyotype (\u22655 abnormalities) found in both BCP-and T-ALL has also been reported as an unfavorable feature. 3 In the last decade, molecular biology, has helped to refine the risk in T-ALL patients. Low expression of ERG and BAALC genes have been associated with a lower relapse risk and a better survival. 4 More recently, mutations of the NOTCH pathway involving NOTCH1 or FBXW7 genes have been shown to confer a favorable prognosis in T-ALL but also T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. 5 This feature may be modulated by the presence of RAS/ PTEN alterations, so that patients with NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations w/o RAS/PTEN alterations have a particularly favorable outcome. 6 Finally, early response to therapy and quantitative minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring during and after induction, either by clone-specific IgH/TCR gene rearrangement detection or by flow cytometry, may be used to summarize the risk at the individual patient level. As in many other diseases, these prognosis factors remain often dependent on the protocol used. Open questions concerning this rare disease diagnosed in relatively young patients remain to be addressed: 1) What is the optimal way to combine disease-related prognostic factors and response evaluation to assess the risk of treatment failure?, 7 2) Which patients are good candidates for allogeneic SCT, in other words which of these prognostic factors are good predictors of survival improvement after SCT? 3) Is there any subgroup of patients that may benefit from new therapeutic approaches? Among evaluated drugs, the nucleoside analogue nelarabine, already approved in relapsed patients, is currently being investigated front-line as postremission therapy. Targeting NOTCH1, IL7-R and especially PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways might be promising therapeutic approaches in this disease. international collaborations validation and standardization of methods is performed: The EuroFlow network established fully standardized 8-color antibody panels as well as tools for bioinformatic assisted expert independent automated analysis of the data acquired. 2;3 Within the EuroMRD network guidelines for standardized real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR of IG/TR gene rearrangements have been published already several years ago. 4 The network organizes periodic ring trials for external quality control of analysis. For BCR-ABL PCR standardization efforts were initially performed within the European Working Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (EWALL), and these efforts were pooled with the EuroMRD experience in 2008, when joined EWALL/EuroMRD meetings started. To date several issues regarding methodology and interpretation guidelines are addressed for generating reliable quantitative data for BCR-ABL transcripts in Ph+ ALL. With the availability of high throughput technologies also next generation sequencing (NGS) emerged as molecular tool for MRD quantification. IG/ TR NGS relies on amplification and high throughput sequencing of IG or TR gene rearrangements using multiplex PCR approaches. One major advantage of this workflow compared to ASO PCR is the applicability of a universal PCR assay without the need of patient-specific reagents. Recent developments offered the proof of principle that NGS-based MRD assessment is feasible and potentially even more sensitive than the standard options.

When assessed by risk group it was clear that at a single dose of 3mg/m 2 did not benefit high risk patients. Since that observation a single dose of 3mg/m 2 was compared to a single dose of 6mg/m 2 in AML17. There was no benefit for 6mg overall, or in the favourable or intermediate risk patients. However 6mg improved survival in high risk patients (n=133) from 18 to 32% at 3 years.

Where a single dose is better than a fractionated schedule will be tested in the AML19 trial. FLAG-Ida: Flag-Ida is a popular schedule for treatment of relapse, but has never been tested in a randomised trial as initial therapy. This was undertaken in AML15. Although there was no difference in in remission rate when compared with DA or DAE, 90% of the remission were achieved with one course. All patients received a second induction course. It was clear that FLAG-Ida resulted in more myelosuppression in later courses, and more deaths in CR. However the relapse risk was significantly reduced so the disease free survival was significantly improved but overall survival was not. Of interest was the retrospective, non-randomised, observation that 2 courses of FLAG-Ida was the same as 2 DA or DAE inductions plus 2 Ara-C consolidation. The value of the second FLAG-Ida course (which for 90% of patients was a consolidation course) is not clear, and will be a randomised in the AML19 trial.

The day 60 mortality was higher in the 90mg arm, but thereafter the survival was identical. Consolidation Randomisation: The traditional consolidation in MRC trials was MACE (amsacrine/Ara-C/ etoposide) MidAC (Mitoxantrone/ Ara-C). When compared with conventional high dose Ara-C there was no overall difference. However for high risk patients MACE/MidAC was superior. Ara-C Dose in Consolidation: 3g/m 2 has been the traditional dose in consolidation. However we found that 1.5g/m 2 for 2 consolidation courses was as effective with reduced myelosuppression. Four vs Five Courses: Few studies has defined precisely how many sources are needed in total. We tested a total of 5 courses vs 4 courses. There was no survival difference.

It is generally believed that there are proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors in chromosome amplifications and deletions, respectively. However, the role of these alternated regions in leukemiagenesis, is still unclear. Recurring deletions of chromosome 7 and 7q [-7/del(7q)] occur in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis. Using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, we show that a~50% reduction in gene dosage of the mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) gene, located on 7q36.1, cooperates with other events occurring in -7/del(7q) AML to promote leukemogenesis. Mll3 suppression impairs the differentiation of HSPC. Interestingly, restoring the expression of Mll3 releases the differentiation block and impairs the progression of established AML. Further, shRNA library screening identifies additional tumor suppressors in -7/del(7q), whose loss might cooperate with Mll3 deficiency to promote AML. Thus, our in vivo functional analysis identifies tumor suppressors in -7/del(7q) in AML. Besides identifying the individual tumor suppressors, we also studied the functions of large chromosome deletions as a whole. Chromosome 17p12 (11B3 in mice), containing the well-known tumor suppressor TP53, is a common deleted region in human cancer, including lymphoma and leukemia. Here, by mouse genetic engineering, we report that 11B3 heterozygous knockout promotes lymphoma and leukemia genesis in mice. Tumors started with 11B3 one-allele-loss have their p53 mutated or silenced on the second allele, resulting in one allele with large deletion while the other allele with p53 mutation or silenced, which precisely mimics the alterations on Chromosome 17p in the majority of human cancer. However, tumors started with p53 one-allele-loss or mutations only lose the second allele of p53 by UPD. Moreover, 11B3 deficient tumors had significantly shorter latency than those with p53 loss only, indicating there are additional tumor suppression functions in this common deleted region beyond p53 only. Further, we show that another tumor suppressor eif5a in Chromosome 17p cooperates with p53 to suppress tumorigenesis, possibly through promoting apoptosis. Thus, large chromosome deletions promote tumorigenesis more than single tumor suppressor, suggesting synergy between multiple tumor suppressors from the same regions. Taken together, our studies conferred chromosome deletions as driver mutations in tumorigenesis.

Delwel Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia. Understanding of the molecular-and biological abnormalities is essential for the development of hypothesis driven therapy of AML. Based on large scale gene expression (1) and gene methylation profile studies (2) we identified AML subtypes with unique genetic and epigenetic aberrations and study the biological consequences of these abnormalities. In particular, we discovered a unique mechanism of transformation of AMLs with either an inv(3)(q21q26.2) or a translocation t(3;3)(q21;q26.2) [inv(3)/t(3;3], malignancies associated with a dismal clinical outcome. Applying functional genomics (4C-Sequencing and ChIP-Sequencing) and genomeengineering (TALENS and CRISPR/CAS9), we that a distal enhancer of GATA2 located at chromosome 3q21 had translocated to the leukemia disease gene EVI1, located at 3q26 (3). This unique translocation of the GATA2 enhancer causes ectopic activation of EVI1 in those leukemia cells. This novel mechanism of transactivation of EVI1 in myeloid disorders was also reported by Yamazaki and colleagues in an elegant humanized mouse model. Besides EVI1 overexpression, we also demonstrated that as the result of the elimination of the enhancer from the 3q21 site, GATA2 at the affected allele is not expressed. Functional haplo-insufficiency arising from inactivating mutations in GATA2 zinc finger DNA binding domains or in GATA2 promoter sequences has been well established as an underlying cause of syndromes characterized by predisposition to myeloid leukemia. We therefore hypothesize that mono-allelic expression of GATA2 is an additional oncogenic event in these AMLs with aberrant EVI1 expression.

Mechanisms exploited by tumor cells to escape T cell immunity include disruption of antigen presentation, down-regulation of HLA molecules, secretion of immune suppressive cytokines, as well as recruitment of regulatory T cells (T REG ) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In the last decade, another powerful immune suppressive mechanism gained much attention: the repressive action of co-inhibitory molecules (CIM) 1 . Activation of T cells is predominantly dependent on both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory members, including members of the CD28:B7 and TNFR family. The balance between positive and negative co-signals determines the functionality of T cells during immunity and tolerance. In addition to the native role of cosignaling, tumor cells can evade immune control by down-regulating co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, and up-regulating various co-inhibitory ligands such as PD-L1, thereby limiting the therapeutic potential of current immunotherapy against cancer. Standard treatment for hematological cancers includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which reduce tumor burden and can induce long-term remission. Moreover, in the past years new therapeutics, including Dasatinib, Rituximab, Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and DNMT inhibitors, have been developed that target tumor cells. However, drug resistance and relapse remain major problems. In addition, cellular immunotherapy is an attractive treatment option to cure hematological malignancies. Such immune cell-based immunotherapies include allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), T cell and NK cell adoptive transfer, and vaccination-based approaches using various antigen formulations or dendritic cells (DC). AlloSCT can be regarded as the most powerful immune cell-based immunotherapy. Donor-derived alloreactive T cell responses eradicate the malignant cells upon recognition of polymorphic HLA-presented peptides, known as minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA). AlloSCT greatly enhanced the cure rate for aggressive hematological cancers, although many patients fail to launch productive immune responses and develop relapses. Moreover, a major drawback of alloSCT is the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a potentially life-threatening side effect predominantly caused by alloreactive T cells recognizing healthy tissues, notably the skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. Because hematorestricted MiHA are solely expressed by the redundant patient hematopoietic system and the hematological malignancy, they hold the key to separate GVT from GVHD. Studies by us and others demonstrated that the cellular immunotherapies described above are often hampered by the action of CIM that attenuate tumor-reactive T cell responses, resulting in sub-optimal clinical results.

PD-L1 molecules on tumor cells can deliver negative signals towards PD-1-expressing tumor-reactive T cells, thereby inhibiting anti-tumor immunity. Indeed, PD-L1 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors 4 . In addition to solid tumors, PD-1/PD-L interactions were shown to be of importance in myeloid malignancies 2 . For instance, long-term persistent murine leukemia cells were shown to sequentially up-regulate PD-L1 and CD80, thereby impairing immune destruction 5 . Upon PD-L1 or CTLA-4 blockade, CTL-mediated lysis of these persistent AML cells was improved. In addition to PD-L1 expression on APCs, PD-1 expression on CD8 + T cells and T REG was also important for tumor persistence of murine AML. Combining PD-L1 blockade with T REG depletion, showed superior efficacy in clearance of AML, due to alleviation of PD-1dependent T REG -mediated suppression 6 . The involvement of PD-1 in alloSCT has been investigated both in mouse models and in the human setting. In a study using a retrovirus-induced CML model, it was demonstrated that tumor-specific T cells can become exhausted 7 . In this model, consisting of PD-1 + tumor-reactive T-cells and PD-L1 + CML cells, exhaustion could be overcome by administration of either PD-L1 antagonistic antibody or PD-1 deficient T cells. In accordance, it was shown that the bulk T cell population from CML patients exhibited increased expression of PD-1 7 . Also, in the alloSCT setting, we observed high PD-1 expression on alloreactive CD8+ T cells that specifically recognize hemato-restricted MiHA in myeloid leukemia patients 8 . Furthermore, proliferation of these PD-1 + MiHA-specific T cells by stimulation with MiHA-loaded DC ex vivo was suboptimal, indicating their dysfunction due to PD-1 signaling. Importantly, upon treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 blocking antibodies ex vivo proliferation of the MiHA-specific CD8+ T cells was reinvigorated. These and many more studies have led to clinical trials exploring the potency of PD-1 blocking antibodies, putting the PD-1 pathway in the forefront of antitumor therapy. Three antagonistic anti-PD-1 antibodies are currently in advanced clinical trials, i.e. pidilizumab (CT-011), nivolumab (BMS-936,558) and pembrolizumab (MK-3475). Furthermore, several anti-PD-L1 antibodies, BMS-936,559, MEDI4736, MPDL3280A and MSB0010718C, are being investigated in clinical trials. In 2012 exciting reports on the use of the anti-PD-1 nivolumab and the anti-PD-L1 blocking antibody BMS-936,559 in patients with advanced malignancies were published 9, 10 . Response rates upon administration of anti-PD-1 to patients with solid tumors ranged from 18-28%, depending on tumor type. Notably, the therapy was relatively well tolerated 11 . Interestingly, also blocking PD-L1, could induce durable tumor regression with an objective response rate of 6-17%, with prolonged responses of over a year. In 2013, the results were reported for the anti-PD-1 antibody pembroluzimab in melanoma 12 . In this more homogenous patient group, a response rate of 38%, and even 52% in the highest dose, were obtained. As in the previous studies, most responses were durable. These exciting results have encouraged registration of these PD-1 blockers. Currently, studies involving hematological cancers are being initiated. A phase I clinical trial performed with CT-011 in patients with varying hematological malignancies showed clinical responses in 6 out of 17 patients, with few adverse events 13 . Furthermore, several trials are underway either exploring PD-1 blockade as monotherapy or in combination with antitumor vaccines in AML and high-risk MDS. CTLA-4: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152), was the first identified CIM, and is partly similar to the cosignaling molecule CD28. While CD28 is constitutively expressed on the membrane of na\u00efve T cells, CTLA-4 is primarily localized in intracellular compartments and quickly translocates to the cell membrane upon T cell activation. The inhibitory function of CTLA-4 was revealed in knockout mice, which showed multi-organ T cell infiltration leading to lethal lymphoproliferative disease. Like CD28, CTLA-4 has an extracellular domain containing the MYPPPY binding motif, enabling both receptors to interact with CD80 and CD86 expressed by APC. However, the binding affinity of CTLA-4 for these ligands is higher by a factor 10-100, thus outcompeting CD28 and thereby promoting immune inhibition 14 . In addition, CTLA-4 signaling in immunosuppressive T REG mediates the control of auto-reactive T cells 15 . Therefore, the effect of CTLA-4 interference could either be due to depletion and/or inhibition of T REG . CTLA-4 signaling can attenuate adaptive immune responses in chronic viral infections and cancer. CTLA-4, like PD-1, as such is not a marker of exhausted cells, but elevated levels on tumor-reactive T cells correlated with their dysfunction in patients with metastatic melanoma 16 . Moreover, in various CD80 and CD86-positive tumor models, monotherapy with CTLA-4 blocking antibody resulted in elimination of established tumors and long-lasting antitumor immunity. Interestingly, CTLA-4 also has an influence on the motility of T cells. After addition of a CTLA-4 antagonist in a mouse model, it was shown that T cells exhibited increased motility, indicating that CIM blockade does not only restore cytolytic activity, cytokine secretion and proliferation, but could also enhance T cell migration 17 . Although anti-CTLA-4 treatment works in vivo, CTLA-4 blockade in vitro has not been successful in reversing T cell dysfunction. This can be due to limitations of the in vitro models, as CTLA-4 blockade may exert it's in vivo action via multiple immune mediators (e.g. effector T cells, antibody responses, T REG ). All these preclinical findings have stimulated clinical exploration of anti-CTLA-4 blocking antibodies. At the moment, two blocking antibodies exist, ipilimumab (MDX-010) and tremelimumab (CP-675,206). Most studies have been performed with ipilimumab in melanoma, and in these patients the median overall survival almost doubled 18 . In follow-up studies, the effects of CTLA-4 blockade were consistent 19 and in 2011, the FDA and EMA approved ipilimumab treatment for advanced melanoma, thereby paving the way for further exploration of therapies targeting CIM in cancer. For both blocking antibodies, not all patients gained clinical benefit, and the occurrence of severe adverse toxic effects upon CTLA-4 blockade remains an issue 20 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 834, "end": 835, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1494, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2211, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3179, "end": 3181, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3182, "end": 3184, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3361, "end": 3363, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3611, "end": 3613, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4107, "end": 4109, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5089, "end": 5091, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5197, "end": 5199, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5586, "end": 5588, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6107, "end": 6109, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6756, "end": 6758, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6830, "end": 6832, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7161, "end": 7163, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Co-inhibitory molecules in cancer"}, {"text": "Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that CTLA-4 can also hamper T cell immunity against hematologic cancers in both the autologous and allogeneic setting. This might be due to native expression of CD80 and/or CD86 on hematologic tumor cells, interacting with the CTLA-4 expressing T cells. For instance, in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, CD86 but not CD80 was expressed by tumor cells, while CTLA-4 was up-regulated on T cells, which led to anergy of the tumor-reactive T cells 21 . Similar to these results, T cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients responded to anti-CD3 activation by a decrease in CD28 and an increase in CTLA-4 expression, resulting in an inhibitory phenotype 22 . Also AML cells heterogeneously express CD86, but CD80 levels were generally low or absent 8, 23 . In addition to autologous antitumor T cell responses, alloreactive T cell function after alloSCT is also strongly influenced by CIM 2 . The importance of CTLA-4 in modulating allogeneic immune responses has been observed by association of certain CTLA-4 genotypes with overall survival and the incidence of leukemia relapse after alloSCT. Furthermore, it was demonstrated in mice that CTLA-4 blockade shortly after alloSCT increased GVHD 25 . However, when anti-CTLA-4 was administered at later time-points after alloSCT, the GVT effect was boosted without signs of GVHD. In patients, ipilimumab administration at late time-points after alloSCT has been explored in one phase I trial 26 . Following a single infusion of ipilimumab in 29 alloSCT patients with a recurrent or progressive hematological malignancy, 3 clinical responses were observed. Importantly, no induction or exacerbation of clinical GVHD was reported, although similar to other CTLA-4 blockade trials 14% of the patients showed organ-specific immune-related adverse events. The lack of GVHD induction is likely attributed to the median interval of one year between last DLI and ipilimumab administration.

Therefore, the effects of concurrent PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade are of great interest. In a mouse tumor model, it was demonstrated that double-positive CD8 + TIL were more dysfunctional than either single PD-1 or CTLA-4 positive CD8 + T-cells.

Appealing combinations are the simultaneous targeting of multiple CIM, use of co-stimulatory agonists in parallel with CIM antagonist, or incorporation of CIM interference in existing cellular therapies. For example, DC vaccination may be applied together with blocking antibodies against CIM to boost T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. In addition, siRNA-mediated silencing of PD-1 ligands on tumor antigen-loaded DC vaccines or in vivo in the tumor micro environment may be attractive way to exploit CIM interference to boost antitumor immunity 30 .

Levine Ebert Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA Lenalidomide is a highly effective drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with del(5q), multiple myeloma, and some additional B cell lymphomas. Lenalidomide binds directly to the CRBN-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. We have used a combination of quantitative proteomic approaches to demonstrate that lenalidomide acts by a novel mechanism of action for a therapeutic agent: in multiple myeloma cells, lenalidomide increases the binding of two substrates, IKZF1 and IKZF3, to the CRBN substrate adapter; increases the ubiquitination of these substrates; and causes the targeted degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3, transcription factors that are essential for the differentiation and survival of plasma cells including multiple myeloma cells. In del(5q) MDS, lenalidomide targets CSNK1A1 for destruction. Haploinsufficiency for CSNK1A1, a gene located within the common deleted region on chromosome 5q, results in selective targeting of the del(5q) clone. Using deletion mutants of IKZF3 we identified a 75 amino acid degron in the N-terminal zinc finger domain that is sufficient for lenalidomide-induced degradation. Based on sequence alignment of that region between lenalidomide responding Ikaros proteins IKZF1 and IZKF3 vs. non-responding IKZF2, IKZF4 and IKZF5 we substituted a single amino acid (IKZF3 Q147H ) that prevented binding of IKZF3 to CRBN and conferred resistance to lenalidomide induced degradation.

Grimwade Cancer Genetics Lab, Guy's Hospital, London, United Kingdom Abstract Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level. Nevertheless, risk stratification used to guide transplant practice in younger adults remains largely based on pretreatment assessment of cytogenetics, an extremely limited panel of molecular genetic markers and morphological assessment of bone marrow blast percentage following induction therapy. However, application of more objective methodology such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has highlighted the limitations of morphology for reliable determination of remission status. Moreover, there is now overwhelming evidence that detection of submicroscopic levels of leukaemia (i.e. Minimal Residual Disease, MRD) using MFC or molecular-based approaches provides powerful independent prognostic information. Implementation of MRD assessment into clinical practice remains a major challenge, hampered by differences in the assays and preferred analytical methods employed by different laboratories. While this should be addressed through adoption of standardized assays with external quality control, it is clear that the molecular heterogeneity of AML coupled with increasing understanding of its clonal architecture dictates that a \"one size fits all\" approach to MRD detection in this disease is not feasible. However, with the range of platforms now available there is considerable scope to realistically track treatment response in every patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest: None"}, {"text": "The seminal TCGA consortium study that involved sequencing 200 AML genomes, has highlighted the molecular complexity of the disease, with the average case harbouring over 10 mutations 1 . Amongst the 200 AMLs analysed,~200 genes were identified as recurrent mutation targets and over 1000 genes found to be mutated in at least 1 case 1 . The availability of high throughput sequencing technologies has fostered interest in the development of targeted sequencing panels to inform patient management 2,3 ; however, the degree of complexity presents a major challenge to define the individual genetic abnormalities or combinations of markers that provide significant independent prognostic information. Indeed, in children and younger adults decisions regarding allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) still remain largely based on cytogenetic risk group and very few molecular markers (FLT3-ITD, CEBPA and NPM1). There is however increasing evidence that assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) status using flow cytometry or molecular approaches can provide powerful independent prognostic information and is increasingly being incorporated into algorithms to guide consolidation therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) has provided a paradigm for MRDdirected therapy (reviewed 4 ), with achievement of molecular remission (CRm) in the bone marrow (BM) incorporated into the standard response criteria in this subset of AML 5 . MRD monitoring used to guide early intervention with arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been reported to improve outcome 6 , particularly in high risk patients and is now considered as a standard of care, as recognised in international disease guidelines 7 . The role of MRD monitoring in other subsets of AML is less well established. Having provided proof of principle in APL, we have investigated the prognostic impact of MRD in the commonest molecular subtype of AML, i.e. characterised by mutations involving the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene. The mutations involve carboxy-terminal tryptophan residues required for nucleolar localisation and generate a nuclear export signal inducing delocalisation of the protein to the cytoplasm (designated NPM1c mutations) 8 . NPM1c leukaemias are molecularly heterogeneous, with outcome influenced by the pattern of cooperating mutations. This has generated interest in molecular profiling to guide treatment approach, particularly concerning allogeneic SCT in first complete remission (CR1). Patients with NPM1c AML with FLT3-ITD and/or DNMT3A mutations have been associated with poorer outcome and are widely considered candidates for SCT. Conversely, those with the NPM1c/FLT3-ITDneg genotype are no longer routinely transplanted in CR1, due to their overall relatively favourable outcome [9] [10] [11] . Given the molecular heterogeneity, we hypothesised that detection of MRD using RNA-based real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays could improve outcome prediction.

This is especially true for patients considered to have intermediate risk, where there is considerable debate over the optimal management (allogeneic transplant vs. chemotherapy).

For AML, even MRD negative patients show relapse rates that are unsatisfactory and some patients deemed MRD positive will not relapse despite receiving no additional therapy [1, 5] . Some of this could be due to limited sensitivity of the assays used. Indeed, increasing sensitivity of improved assays including nextgeneration sequencing has the inherent appeal of detecting residual disease well below the threshold of current assays. For ALL, high sensitivity of the MRD assay seems to be of clinical benefit, since it enables the treating physician to clearly identify patients at high risk of relapse. For AML, this could be true as well, however formal proof of this concept is lacking to date. Rather it is at least questionable whether there is any clinical benefit in lowering the threshold of MRD positivity to those used in ALL [11, 12] .

This was not due to decreased engraftment in Col1-caPPR, as assessed by Southern blotting for retrovirally transduced clones. In fact, the prolonged latency of CML-like MPN in Col1-caPPR mice was due to a reduced number of LSC and a reduced frequency of cycling LSC compared to WT recipients, as tested by flow cytometry and secondary transplantation assays. In contrast, transplantation of bone marrow transduced with the oncogene MLL-AF9 + , known to be associated with AML in humans and mice, into Col1-caPPR recipients led to accelerated AML-like disease and increased disease clonality compared to WT recipients. Administration of an Fc fusion protein of osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and, thereby, a potent inhibitor of the bone phenotype in Col1-caPPR mice, led to restoration of the CML-like MPN in Col1-caPPR mice.

Levis Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who harbor an internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD mutation) have a generally worse outcome than their counterparts with wild type FLT3, although this difference can be mitigated somewhat if they undergo allogeneic transplant in first remission [1] . Given that the ITD mutation leads to constitutive activation of the receptor and contribute to the transformed phenotype [2] , clinically useful small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of FLT3 have been a goal of numerous researchers around the world for more than a decade [3] . Initial efforts to develop a FLT3 inhibitor began with re-purposing multitargeted kinase inhibitors, lestaurtinib (CEP-701) and midostaurin (PKC-412), as FLT3 inhibitors [4, 5] . These agents were clinically disappointing, largely because the plasma levels of these drugs required to achieve complete FLT3 inhibition resulted in unacceptable off-target effects [6, 7] . Another re-purposed TKI, sorafenib, is somewhat more selective than previous agents, has in vitro and in vivo activity against FLT3 [8] [9] [10] , and is the agent that has thus far been used to demonstrate a clear clinical benefit of FLT3 inhibition for FLT3/ITD AML patients, particularly in the post-transplant setting [11] [12] [13] . However, because of its multi-targeted nature, sorafenib use in patients is clearly associated with hand-foot syndrome, gastro-intestinal disturbance, and vascular events, rendering it somewhat difficult to use even in the best of circumstances. Quizartinib (AC220) is the first FLT3 TKI to be developed specifically for FLT3-ITD AML. The drug is more potent in vitro and in vivo than any previously developed FLT3 inhibitor [14] [15] [16] , and it's in vivo potency is probably directly attributable to its high degree of selectivity-cKit is the only other major target receptor affected. As monotherapy in patients with relapsed, refractory FLT3-ITD AML, quizartinib induced clearance of peripheral blasts and terminal differentiation of marrow blasts in roughly half of treated patients [17] . Importantly, most of these responses were classified as \"CRi\" (complete remission with incomplete count recovery) because of the persistent red cell and platelet transfusion dependence in these patients, despite their having a marrow blast percentage of well below 5% [16] . The failure to recover normal hematopoiesis in most patients could have been in part due to inhibition of c-Kit [18] , but more likely was due to the marrow suppressive effects of minimal residual disease. The clinical benefit of these responses, however, was manifest by a large number of patients being successfully bridged to an allogeneic transplant [19] . The importance of proceeding relatively quickly to a transplant was underscored by the emergence of resistance-conferring point mutations within the FLT3 coding sequence in many patients while on quizartinib monotherapy [20] . Quizartinib has now advanced to a pivotal trial in which patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD AML are randomized to receive either salvage chemotherapy or monotherapy with quizartinib (NCT02039726). These clinical studies have provided additional proof of the benefit of FLT3 inhibition, and the development of resistance mutations offer the best evidence yet of the relative importance of this oncogene in leukemogenesis. However, they highlighted two areas in which the approach could possibly be improved, namely by addressing the resistance mutations, and by avoiding inhibition of c-Kit. Two inhibitors have recently emerged into clinical development with the potential to address these issues. Crenolanib is a TKI originally developed as a PDGFR inhibitor [21] . It is a potent FLT3 inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo, but with relatively less activity against the other type III RTK, c-Kit [22] . In addition, it has activity against the most common type of resistance-conferring mutation, namely that found at residue D835 in the kinase domain. Early clinical studies have confirmed a meaningful response rate induced by crenolanib as monotherapy [23] , and the drug is now being studied in combination with salvage chemotherapy in a randomized trial (Vinay Jain, Arog Pharmaceuticals, personal communication). ASP2215 is a novel small molecule TKI originally developed as an inhibitor of Axl. It has potent activity in vivo against FLT3, including both the kinase domain mutations as well as the so-called gatekeeper mutation at residue F691 [24] . A number of trials with this agent are underway (NCT02014558) or are in active planning, including those in combination with chemotherapy. It seems inevitable that one or more of these agents will eventually make it through the drug approval process. The challenge going forward will be to find the best way to incorporate these TKIs into current AML treatment regimens to maximize the survival for these patients. While using these agents to improve remission rates and to maintain remission after allogeneic transplant seems likely to be the initial approach, combinations with additional targeted agents, specifically those that can overcome the protective effect of the bone marrow microenvironment, may ultimately be the optimal approach.

Lastly, we investigated several cases of paired diagnosis and relapsed disease to determine the clonal basis of relapse. From these 3 cases, we detected 3 patterns. In the first, the relapsed disease was clonally identical to the disease at diagnosis indicating a failure to eradicate this dominant diagnostic clone. In the second, a minor subclone from the time of diagnosis was present as the dominant clone at relapse. In the third, a new mutation occurred at relapse suggesting further clonal evolution of a leukemic, or possibly, pre-leukemic clone. Thus, there may be multiple clonal paths to relapse in AML, and even potentially multiple paths in an individual patient. In summary, we have shown that AML develops from the serial acquisition of mutations in self-renewing HSC that we term preleukemic HSC. Moreover, mutation acquisition is not random with patterns indicating that mutations in genes affecting the epigenome occur first, followed by mutations in genes that affect activated signal transduction and other pathways. It remains to be seen if this order is recapitulated universally in AML, or if there are clinical and biological differences if the order is reversed. In addition, we showed that pre-leukemic HSC persist in clinical remission, and that relapsed disease may arise from multiple mechanisms, including the possibility of new mutations occurring in pre-leukemic HSC.

Seven genes were identified which had promoter DMRs and expression level associated with overall survival, including CD34, RHOC, SCRn1, F2RL1, FAM92A1, MIR155HG, and VWA8. For all of these genes, lower expression and higher DNA methylation were associated with longer overall survival. The authors determined that patients who had high expression of only zero or one of these genes had excellent rates of complete remission (CR, 91% and 100%, respectively) and overall survival (82% and 76%), compared to very poor outcomes in patients with six or seven highly expressed genes (CR 71%, 53%; OS 24%, 5%; for 6 and 7 genes, respectively). This seven-gene score performed very favorably compared to other published models and it is hoped that a practical quantitative assay can be developed to facilitate rapid integration into clinical practice. [1] Data from Alliance AML trials were used as a validation cohort for a combined molecular and clinical prognostic model for relapse and survival in cytogenetically normal AML patients of all ages. [2] Pastore et al. used data from 572 cytogenetically normal AML patients treated on the German AML Cooperative Group 99 (AMLCG99) study comparing thioguanine, cytarabine, and daunorubicin plus high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM) versus HAMHAM as induction therapy were used for. Validated prognostic indices for relapse and survival were developed based on age, performance status, white blood cell count and mutation status of NPM1, CEBPA and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD). These data are readily available to clinicians and application of this schema should be straightforward. The authors conclude that theirs is the first prognostic system to combine clinical and molecular features specifically for cytogenetically normal AML and irrespective of age. [2] Metzeler et al. studied 364 patients (ages 18-83) with cytogenetically normal AML treated on Alliance trials in an effort to determine whether a previously identified stem cell-like gene expression signature is independently associated with inferior outcomes. [3] It is believed that AML is derived from a distinct, quiescent, chemotherapy-resistant population of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Eppert et al. compared gene expression profiles between functionally defined LSCs and leukemic cell populations without stem cell activity and identified a \"core enriched (CE)\" signature with 44 stem-cell associated genes that are highly expressed in LSCs. In this work, patients with cytogenetically normal AML who had an increased CE signature had worse overall outcomes. [4, 3] These data were confirmed using the Alliance cohort. Furthermore, it was shown that a high CE score was an independent predictor of decreased rates of complete remission, disease-free survival and overall survival even after adjusting for standardly accepted clinical and molecular prognostic indicators. Future studies to identify the functional role of LSC signature genes and to investigate the relationships between CE signature and other molecular abnormalities in AML are required. [3] Niederwieser et al. investigated the clinical significance of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B using samples from 210 older cytogenetically normal AML patients (age 60-83) treated with intensive chemotherapy on Alliance trials. [5] Patients with high expression of DNMT3B had significantly inferior rates of complete remission, disease-free survival and overall survival. Also, DNMT3B expression was an independent predictor or poor outcomes in multivariate analyses. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the clinical and therapeutic relevance of this finding. [5] The prognostic significance of GAS6 expression was also investigated in 270 older AML patients with cytogenetically normal AML treated with intensive chemotherapy on Alliance clinical trials. [6] GAS6 is the common ligand for all three TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) and binds AXL with high affinity. AXL expression has been reported as a poor prognostic indicator in cytogenetically normal AML and it is possible that aberrant autocrine expression of GAS6 may result in activation of AXL. [7] Whitman et al. demonstrated that GAS6 expression is an adverse prognostic indicator in cytogenetically normal AML and suggest development of targeted treatments against GAS6/AXL signaling. [6] Although patients with normal cytogenetics comprise the largest and best characterized subgroup in AML, chromosomal abnormalities are common and extremely important for prognosis. [9] Outcomes were poor, with 64% CR and 15% overall survival at 5 years. There were no significant differences in CR, DFS or OS between younger and older patients with sole +8. The abnormality was found to be molecularly heterogeneous, with frequent mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, IDH2, DNMT3A, NPM1 and FLT3-ITD. High BAALC expression and FLT3-ITD were associated with inferior outcomes in younger patients and TET2 mutations and wild-type RAS resulted in worse outcomes for older patients with isolated +8. [9] Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) enjoy excellent outcomes, made even better by the use of arsenic trioxide as part of up-front treatment of newly diagnosed patients. In previously untreated patients with low or intermediate risk APL, it is possible that treatment with arsenic trioxide during consolidation (CALGB 9710) may eliminate the need for maintenance chemotherapy. [10] A non-inferiority trial, terminated due to poor accrual, demonstrated no relapses in either group of 105 APL patients randomized to maintenance or observation. In another follow-up study of Alliance 9710, 48% of 245 newly diagnosed adult patients with APL were found to have mutations in FLT3, 31% FLT3-ITD and 14% with a point mutation (FLT3-D835). [11] Neither type of mutation affected rates of CR, induction death, DFS or overall survival and treatment with arsenic trioxide during consolidation improved outcomes regardless of mutational status. However, even after treatment with arsenic trioxide, APL patients with complex karyotype had significantly decreased overall survival. [11] Treatment outcomes for older patients with AML remain dismal worldwide and novel strategies are clearly needed. Alliance study 10502 investigated the addition of the proteasome-inhibitor bortezomib to standard daunorubicin/cytarabine induction and to intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation in 95 newly diagnosed patients with AML age 60-75 years. [12] Bortezomib inhibits the master transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF\u03baB), which is increased in AML cells and LSCs. [13] Although bortezomib has virtually no activity as a single agent in AML, it showed preliminary efficacy when combined with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease. [14] In newly diagnosed patients, the combination of bortezomib and standard chemotherapy was feasible, had an acceptable toxicity profile and resulted in an encouraging rate of complete remission (65%). Further investigation of this regimen in older adults with AML is warranted. The role of bortezomib in AML induction was explored in Alliance trial 11002, in which newly diagnosed older AML patients were randomized between ten days of decitabine with and without the addition of bortezomib. The trial was designed based on favorable clinical outcomes of the ten-day induction schedule from three single-center studies and previously demonstrated clinical and pharmacodynamics activity for the combination. [15] [16] [17] [18] CALGB 11002 also included comprehensive geriatric assessments and extensive correlative scientific studies. Accrual has been completed and data are anticipated imminently. CALGB 11002 ran concurrently with trial 11001, a phase II trial of conventional daunorubicin and cytarabine combined with sorafenib for newly diagnosed AML patients \u226560 years with FLT3 mutations. Preliminary results from this single-arm, multicenter phase II trial were presented at the 2013 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and showed CR or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRi) in 69% of 52 evaluable patients. There was no excess toxicity attributed to sorafenib. [19] Interestingly, a similar trial conducted in Europe failed to show a benefit for this regimen in older AML patients. [20] Conventional intensive chemotherapy induction is often withheld from older patients due to well-justified morbidity and mortality concerns. However, although the median age at diagnosis of AML is over 70 years, it is well-known that clinical trials include few patients with very advanced age. Investigators from the Alliance, German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG), German-Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG), and the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) pooled data from several large studies of older patients with AML treated with intensive induction and identified 138 octagenarians. [21] The majority of the patients had a performance status of zero or one (69%) and normal cytogenetics (47.1%). Complex karyotype was identified in 14.5% of patients and isolated trisomy 8 in 9.4%. The complete response rate for patients surviving beyond 60 days was 39%. Overall survival at 1 year was 24%, with only 8% surviving for 3 years. FLT-3 internal tandem duplication was not associated with overall survival, while NPM1 mutations were associated with significantly longer survival. [21] AML is a highly molecularly heterogeneous disease and efforts are underway to adapt induction strategies to specific molecular subtypes. CALGB 10801 was a phase II study of induction (daunorubicin/ cytarabine) and consolidation (high-dose cytarabine) chemotherapy plus the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, followed by continuation therapy with dasatinib alone in newly diagnosed patients with core binding factor AML. Diagnosis of core binding factor AML was defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) or the molecular equivalent RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion transcript or inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22) or the molecular equivalent CBFB/MYH11 fusion transcript. Preliminary data are highly anticipated and will be presented at the 2014 ASH meeting. Data are also expected from CALGB 10603, an international, randomized phase III study of induction (daunorubicin/cytarabine) and consolidation (highdose cytarabine) chemotherapy combined with midostaurin or placebo in treatment-naive patients with FLT3 mutated AML.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1067, "end": 1070, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1269, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2043, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2307, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2810, "end": 2813, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2814, "end": 2816, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3305, "end": 3308, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3537, "end": 3540, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3879, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4072, "end": 4075, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4392, "end": 4395, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4585, "end": 4588, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4769, "end": 4772, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5274, "end": 5277, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5667, "end": 5671, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6022, "end": 6026, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6358, "end": 6362, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6714, "end": 6718, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6844, "end": 6848, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7019, "end": 7023, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7729, "end": 7733, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7734, "end": 7738, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7739, "end": 7743, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7744, "end": 7748, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8422, "end": 8426, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8543, "end": 8547, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9136, "end": 9140, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9630, "end": 9634, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "The role of maintenance therapy in AML remains unclear.

Cancer-associated point mutations in IDH1 lead to the acquisition of aneomorphic activity that allows for the NADPH-dependent reduction of aKG to the oncometabolite (R)-2 hydroxyglutarate (2HG) which is present in vast excess in patients with IDH1 mutations 2 .

It was been shown that resistance of hematopoietic cells in the graft to the toxic effects of CY can be mediated through the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) which is contained in those cells on a high expression level [6] . In addition, regulatory T cells have also the ability to up-regulate the cytoplasmatic enzyme ALDH which is responsible for the detoxification of activated CY in an inactivated form [7] . Thus, acute and chronic GvHD was effective prevented by this TCR/HDCYapproach with no impact of the higher degree of the HLA-disparity on the rate of GvHD or NRM while a trend to a lower relapse risk and improved event-free survival was observed [8] . However, disease control achieved by those non-myeloablative TCR/HD CY haplo-HSCT protocols was disappointing with more than one half of the patients relapsing after one year, and relapse being the predominant cause of treatment failure. One attempt to improve disease control in patients with high-risk disease (refractory, relapse) is to itensify conditioning, the other is to use peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) instead of bone marrow. Accordingly, the Atlanta group treated 20 patients with hematologic malignancies (high-risk relapsed/refractory n=11) using the TCR/HD CY platform for myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine and busulfan [9] .

Clofarabine has shown anti-leukemic acitivity, both in myeloid and lymphoid blasts. Over the past years the concept of a sequential therapy consisting of a cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by RIC in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been demonstrated to be an efficient and tolerable treatment strategy for patients with relapsed, refractory or high-risk acute myeloid leukemia undergoing HLA-matched transplantation at our center and elsewhere [13] . Sequential therapy addresses one major concern in non-remission patients: the reduction of the leukemic burden and the enhancement of the disease control by administration of a highly effective anti-leukemic chemotherapy before allo-HSCT in order to provide more time for the presumed graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect after allo-HSCT. We treated 18 patients (median age 39 years; nine male) with advanced, acute leukemia (AML n=15; ALL=3) who lacked a suitable HLA-matched donor. No patient was in remission prior to transplant. All patients received cytoreduction with clofarabine (5 x 30 mg/m2 IV over 5 days), followed after three days of rest by conditioning for T-cell-replete haplo-HSCT. HD CY (50 mg IVon day +3 and 4), tacrolimus (targeted levels 8-12 \u03bcg/l) and MMF (4 x 500 mg IV) were used for post-grafting immunosuppression. In absence of GvHD, MMF was stopped on day +35 and tacrolimus was tapered and discontinued until day +180. In contrast to the Baltimore protocol disease-specific and individual modifications were undertaken in the last part of conditioning in most patients due to the high variability given among patients with relapsed and refractory non-remission acute leukemia. Hence, conditioning consisted of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus either melphalan, treosulfan/etoposide or TBI. The treatment schedule in detail is shown in Figure 2 . Bi-directional tolerance was induced: while allowing successful engraftment, rates of acute GvHD II-IV (22%) und chronic GvHD (28%; no severe) were low. Cumulative incidence of NRM was 6% at day + 30, but increased to23 % at one-year with infectious complications being the main cause of NRM. Most commonly seen severe toxicities (grade III-IV) were transient elevation of liver enzymes (44%) and mucositis (40%), while the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis was low (11%). Given the high-risk profile of our patients results were encouraging. This is reflected by a CR rate of 78% on day + 30, while OS was 56% and RFS was 39% one-year after sequential haplo-HSCT. In particular, outcome was favourable for relapsed-ALL patients with 2 out of 3 patient still alive two-years after haplo-HSCT. We conclude that sequential therapy is feasible in the context of the TCR-haplo HSCT approach and provides an acceptable toxicity profile and anti-leukemic activity in high-risk acute leukemia patients with active disease at time of transplant, while rates of GvHD and NRM were comparable to results of HLA-matched transplantation. Using HLA-haploidentical donors and the TCR/HD CY haplo-HSCT platform proved also to be feasible and showed encouraging results in patients with acute leukemia relapse after a first allogeneic transplantation [14] . We retrospectively analyzed the courses of 20 consecutive adults (median age 37 years; 12 male) with AML (n=14), ALL (n=5) and acute bi-phenotypic leukemia (n=1). Conditioning consisted of fludarabine, CY and either melphalan or TBI or tresosulfan+/-etoposide. While engraftment was achieved in 85%, the rate of grade II-IV acute GvHD was 35% and chronic GvHD occurred in five patients. Toxicity was moderate. Most commonly observed severe toxicities (grade III-IV) were mucositis (30%), hyperbilirubinemia (20%), elevation of transaminases (20%) and creatinine (20%), while invasive fungal infection affected 30%. One-year NRM was 36%. At a median follow-up of 17 months, one-year OS was 45% and RFS was 33%.

Although somatic mutations arising early in the evolution of AML are present in every leukemic cell (i.e. in the founding clone), we are also often able to identify multiple subclonal leukemic populations at the time of diagnosis. Each subclone harbors its own set of unique somatic mutations in addition to the mutations present in the founding clone. These additional mutations have presumably provided the tumor cell acquiring them with a competitive advantage, allowing it to clonally expand. The selective pressure of cytotoxic therapy can dramatically alter the clonal architecture of AML, with certain (often minor or even undetectable) subclones at diagnosis becoming the dominant leukemic population at the time of relapse after induction chemotherapy [4] . The clonal evolution of tumor cells under the selective pressure of cytotoxic therapy is increasingly being recognized as a common phenomenon in a variety of cancers [5] . This is important clinically as curative therapy requires the elimination of both the founding clone and all of its subsequently arising subclones. Our research group has revealed the hematopoietic progenitors from healthy individuals to be also genetically heterogeneous [6] . By performing exome sequencing on the progeny of sorted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) obtained from healthy donors, we discovered that these cells acquire somatic mutations as a function of age. HSPCs obtained from cord blood samples possessed a low number of validated somatic mutations. On the other hand, HSPCs from adult donors possessed an increased number of mutations, with the total number of mutations strongly correlating with the age of the donor. Thus, each individual possesses a genetically heterogeneous HPSC population with each HSPC having its own unique set of somatic mutations and with the total number of mutations increasing as the individual ages. The majority of these age-related mutations are likely biologically and clinically insignificant. However, multiple studies have shown that, in elderly individuals without a known hematologic disorder, oligoclonal hematopoiesis often is identifiable [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This suggests that, in these individuals, a genetically distinct hematopoietic cell has gained a competitive fitness advantage over its counterparts and clonally expanded. Of particular note, our research group recently analyzed blood leukocyte sequence data from 2,728 patients enrolled in The Cancer Genome Atlas without a known hematologic malignancy [14] . Somatic mutations were identified in over 2% of the subjects and in over 5% of the subjects greater than 70 years of age. Many of these mutations were in genes with welldescribed roles in hematologic malignancies including DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and TP53. This data suggests that mutations in these classic AML and MDS \"driver\" genes may provide the HSPCs acquiring them with a competitive advantage.

Firstly, there is no such thing as the optimal sample other than obtaining tissue directly from the lung which is not only hazardous but is also seldom possible given the patient population. Hence the aim is to obtain the best possible specimen that fits the purpose best. Sputum is seldom, if ever, useful. not least because the lack of neutrophils means it is not produced during neutropenia. Rather the respiratory secretions that are expectorated are just that but often very mucoid and viscous and may only represent the slime frequently associated with mucositis. Moreover bacteria recovered from culture typically represent the oral microbial flora unless, of course, a professional pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae is recovered. Most often pulmonary infectious diseases are caused by opportunistic pathogens making any distinction between colonization and infection all but impossible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Many years ago it was assumed that aetiology of pulmonary infectious diseases could be deduced from blood cultures when bacteraemia occurred at the same time. Hence the aetiology was ascribed to bacteria and certain yeasts such as Candida albicans on that basis alone. However this notion has been rightly discarded as being wrong. With the advent of better radiology and fibre optic bronchoscopy it has become more the norm to sample the lung by instilling fluid typically saline into the lungs, washing the site and attempting to recover most of it for microbiological investigation. The technique is widely known as bronchoalveolar lavage and requires a skilled and experienced respiratory physician to perform it reliably and safely but only if indicated by radiography. It is also true to say that not all bronchoscopies are the same and neither are all BAL fluids. None the less the specimen obtained at least has the merit of giving a more representative sample of the affected area of the lung.

For instance, if the prevalence of a given infection is very low then the test should lean towards excluding the diagnosis rather than confirming it. By contrast, if the prevalence is relatively high the test would be better employed to confirm the diagnosis reliably. Detecting galactomannan to diagnosis aspergillosis provides a useful example. Firstly, a bronchoscopy is only done when certain abnormalities are seen and there is least a real possibility of an infectious aetiology. Moreover nodules with or without a halo sign already meet the definition of possible disease thereby increasing the likelihood of aspergillosis markedly to perhaps as high as 30%. It is often forgotten that positive and negative predictive values of a given test are the product of test sensitivity or specificity and prevalence, and that one has usually to sacrifice sensitivity to obtain the highest specificity and vice versa. In the example of galactomannan it can be shown that although the analytical threshold is set at an optical index of 0.5 the clinical threshold should be set at a higher value least 1.0 to obtain the highest positive predictive value so that a positive test result is credible and confirms the diagnosis of aspergillosis. In most cases, a so-called typical radiographic appearance as described by the EORTC/MSG definitions during neutropenia is strongly associated with Aspergillus infection rather than one due to any other mould. Should a range of 20 plus tests be conducted \"just in case\"? If so not only is this costly but the value of the information will be difficult to ascertain as the result may be wholly inconsistent with the clinical signs and radiographic appearance.

Complete depletion of peripheral B cells occurs rapidly after initial administration, resulting in the sustained absence of circulating B cells throughout treatment. T-cell activation and redistribution also occur rapidly, followed by T-cell expansion due to the proliferation of memory T-cell subsets (CD8+ T EM and T EMRA cells, and CD4+ T CM and T EM cells). A transient release of cytokines occurs within 48 hours after initial administration (mainly IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3), predominantly in the first cycle of treatment. 6 Cytokine release appears to correlate with dose of blinatumomab and with B-cell counts. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as a clinically significant adverse event has been observed in patients with ALL, 7 but can be mitigated by step-wise dosing of blinatumomab in the first cycle (i.e., 9 \u03bcg/day on days 1-7 and 28 \u03bcg/day on days 8-29) and premedication with dexamethasone. No differences have been detected in the timeframe and hierarchy of cytokine release between clinical responders and nonresponders, but slightly lower mean cytokine concentrations were observed in nonresponders. Blinatumomab has been shown to induce rapid and long-term responses in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and ALL, both representing difficult-to-treat populations with historically poor rates of response and overall survival. In patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most recent analysis of 21 evaluable patients from a phase 2 study demonstrated an overall response rate of 43%, with a median response duration of 11.6 months. 8 The activity of blinatumomab was examined in a pivotal single-arm phase 2 study in a population of adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL with particularly high risk of poor outcome. 9 Of 189 patients treated, 43% achieved a CR/CRh (CRh = complete response with partial recovery of peripheral blood counts). The median relapse-free survival was 5.9 months and the median overall survival was 6.1 months. A molecular response (MRD negativity) was achieved by 82% of the evaluable patients with a complete response. Three patients had Grade 3 CRS. Neurologic events, which were typically reversible, occurred in 11% (Grade 3) and 2% (Grade 4) of patients. Based on these data, blinatumomab was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 127, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 227, "end": 228, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1143, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2197, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2386, "end": 2387, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Blinatumomab"}, {"text": "Overall survival of patients with AML is poor, and standard treatment with intensive chemotherapy regimens followed by stem cell transplant is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Current efforts focus on the reduction of toxicity associated with standard therapy including the implementation of less toxic and highly effective agents such as ATO. ATO is the most effective single agent in APL 4;5 . ATO acts via complex mechanism in APL that is not yet fully explained. At a high concentration (0.5 to 2.0 \u03bcmol/L) ATO induces apoptosis in vitro, while at lower concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 \u03bcmol/l) it induces partial differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes through PML/ RAR\u03b1 degradation and inhibits angiogenesis [6] [7] [8] [9] . ATO is licensed for the treatment of relapsed and refractory APL in the USA and Europe [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and can achieve remission rates in up to 90 % of patients. Concerning its toxicity profile, ATO is usually well tolerated and its use is associated with a series of manageable adverse events (hyperleucocytosis, increase of liver enzymes, APL differentiation syndrome, prolongation of the QT interval 19 ). Most of the adverse events mentioned above are usually mild and manageable 10;18 . The antileukemic efficiency of ATO is increased when combined with ATRA. ATO as single agent is able to induce durable molecular remission after two cycles in the majority of patients treated for disease recurrence 17 . Results of various studies conducted with ATO as single agent or combined with ATRA for newly diagnosed APL patients reported CR rates of 86-95 %, molecular remission rates after two cycles of 76-100 % and survival rates of 86-88 %, with significantly better responses being obtained in patients with non-high risk disease as compared to high-risk patients [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

In addition, the results of a recent published randomized trial evaluating ATO in first-line therapy during consolidation demonstrated that ATO further reduced the risk of recurrence and improved survival 25 .

Method: To achieve this goal we used a xenotrasplantation assay into immune-deficient mice, and performed Ig/TCR rearrangement analysis and genome-wide SNP array screening of diagnostic samples from patients and xenograft leukemias from transplanted mice Results:We have observed that MLL-AF4+ infant ALL is composed of a branching subclonal architecture already at diagnosis, frequently driven by an Ig/TCR-rearranged founder clone. Each clone is potentially able to contribute to the diverse phenotypic pool of MLL-AF4+ L-ICs. Interestingly, some clones which were minor at diagnosis can reactivate and become dominant upon serially transplantation in mice, whereas other major dominant clones at diagnosis can become quiescent and disappear. Investigation of paired diagnostic and relapse samples suggested that relapses often occur from subclones already present (but quiescent) at diagnosis. Finally, Copy-number alterations arising at relapse might contribute to the activation and expansion of previously quiescent subclones. , to characterize acute leukemias. In the model we primarily focused on the dependence of the duration from the first mutation to the diagnosis of the leukemic disease (time-to-diagnosis) on leukemic stem cell's (LSC) selfrenewal and proliferation rates. We simulated a healthy hematopoietic system and added a small amount of mutated stem cells with predefined proliferation (range: 0-2) and selfrenewal (range: 0-1) to the system. The development of a leukemia is observed for 2000 days and the time-to-diagnosis (days) is calculated for each parameter combination. Results: The model shows that even slowly proliferating LSC can become a leukemia when selfrenewal is high enough. The analysis of the time-to-diagnosis showed that LSC with high proliferation and high selfrenewal are responsible for \"fast\" leukemias, i.e., lead to a short time between initial mutation and diagnosis, while decreased proliferation or decreased selfrenewal leads to \"slower\" leukemias. We could also show that selfrenewal is the more sensitive parameter with regards to \"leukemic pace\". In particular, there seems to exist a lower threshold for selfrenewal. Below this threshold no leukemia occurs any more, at least in the model. Conclusion: Mechanistic mathematical models are useful tools to analyze hematological diseases. In particular, we analyzed the emergence of leukemia before therapy starts to generate an individualized model based risk classification, i.e. the mechanistic model can be used as basis for a statistical model to fit longitudinal patient data to determine a patient's \"leukemic pace type\". The next step will be to incorporate chemotherapy into the model and generate hypotheses about optimal therapy schemata. Conflict of interest: None Chromosome 17p deletions are among the most frequent genetic abnormalities in various cancers and associated with a dismal prognosis. However, they have long been simply considered as the inactivation of tumor suppressor gene TP53. Previous work in our laboratory identified additional tumor suppressor genes next to TP53, indicating that large deletions on 17p may contribute to cancer biology beyond their impact on eliminating wildtype TP53 allele. To explore this further, we generated a novel geneticallyengineered mouse model that incorporates conditional deletion of chromosome 11B3, which is syntenic to the common deletion region on human 17p13. We found that besides p53, heterozygous deletion of linked genes on 11B3 not only promotes Myc-driven lymphomagenesis or Nf1; Mll3-defective acute myeloid leukemogenesis as seen by shorter tumor latency and overall survival than controls with only p53 loss, but also contributes to the poor outcome of chemotherapy treatments as shown by additional resistance to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and methotrexate. Furthermore, most tumor cells generated from heterozygous deletion of 11B3 have spontaneously missense or frame-shift mutations on the other wildtype p53 allele during the loss of p53 heterozygosity, which represents the major p53 configurations in human cancers. We further identified key players in 17p13 region that is capable of promoting E\u03bc-Myc lymphoma development by its own or cooperating with p53 suppression in tumorigenesis. To Introduction: The nature of leukemia initiating cells (LIC) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains elusive, although being of key clinical relevance since LICs need to be eradicated in order to cure the disease. The hierarchical concept with few LIC being able to propagate leukemia upon transplantation onto immunodeficient mice has been challenged by data showing LIC-activity also in committed cells supporting a stochastic model. However, as a common strategy, these studies are based on defining sub-populations by distinct surface marker profiles. Material and methods: Aberrant energy metabolism was reported in cancer including altered redox states in cells with stem cell properties. In this study, we analyzed redox states of primary ALL cells and analyzed whether cellular energy metabolism determines LIC activity. Patient derived xenograft ALL samples were investigated for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in combination with cell cycle analysis. Cellular sub-fractions sorted according to high or low ROS levels were analyzed for repopulating activities in our NOD/SCID/huALL xenograft model. Interestingly, we identified a low oxidative state in cells of early G0/G1 cell cycle phases, which also show increased NOD/SCID repopulation. In contrast, ROS high cells originate from later cell cycle phases (G2/M) suggesting that the ALL cells' oxidative state is indicative for its leukemia initiating activity. To functionally address this hypothesis, sorted ROS high and ROS low patient derived leukemia cells were transplanted onto NOD/SCID mice. Both sub-fractions led to leukemia engraftment with ROS low cells showing higher repopulating activity compared to ROS high ALL cells. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data indicate that all cells in ALL show LIC activity, with cells of low energy metabolism representing the driving leukemia initiating cell compartment, thus pointing to redox modulation as a potential therapeutic target in ALL. Conflict of Interest: None Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify genes associated with leukemic stem cell (LSC) activity in primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) specimens to gain novel insights into the molecular networks controlling LSC self-renewal. Methods: We combined next-generation sequencing technologies with functional in vivo assays to identify LSC associated genes and used combinatorial cell sorting strategies to determine the enrichment for LSCs in sorted fractions. Results: We identified the G-protein coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) as a novel LSC marker in AML. Sorting experiments revealed a hierarchical architecture, in which GPR56 identified more primitive cells compared to GPR56 negative cells, both in vitro and in vivo. GPR56 + CD34 + double positive cells were most highly enriched for engrafting LSCs not only in fresh samples, but also after in vitro culture in optimized conditions that support LSC activity ex vivo. AML samples with high GPR56 gene expression were significantly enriched for adverse genetic aberrations such as FLT3-ITD, EVI1 rearrangements, and mutations in TP53 and RUNX1. Furthermore, high GPR56 gene expression on its own was associated with poor prognosis in independent patient cohorts. Conclusion: Here we established GPR56 as a novel LSC marker that reveals a leukemic hierarchy and as a factor of poor prognosis in AML. Our data provide evidence that LSC phenotypes are heterogeneous and remain to be defined in GPR56 negative samples. The hematopoietic stem cell differentiates in progenitors and then in mature blood cells. Mechanisms of leukemogenesis block this differentiation. We defined the Cell of Arrest of Cancer (CAC) as the stage of hematopoietic differenciation in which leukemic cells are blocked. We thought that the cell of arrest of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) dictated functionnal properties of AML and was induced by specific genetic anomalies. Patients and methods: We extensively phenotyped normal hematopoietic progenitors to create signatures of CAC of AML. These signatures allowed us to classify 932 AML patients seen in our Leukemia Unit between 2000 and 2012 as well as 142 AML patients published by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network project (NEJM, 2013) . This study thus relies on our own data and databases publicly available. Results: Our phenotypes of HSC, MPP, CMP, GMP and GP/MP allowed us to classify AML as HSC-like, MPP-like, CMP-like, GMP-like or GP/MP-like. We validate the phenotypic classification of AML with a transcriptomic signature of normal stem cells and hematopoietic progenitors (HSCP) and gene set enrichment analysis. Based on normal HSCP properties, we show that CAC influences functions of AML as proliferation, chemoresistance and metabolism. Earlier the blockage occurs in the differentiation process and poorer the prognosis of patients is. Identification of the CAC allows to highlight the role of CEBPA in stage -specific blockage. This method gives insight of leukemogenesis mechanisms and defines unexpected stage of blockage. Discussion: We propose a new concept in cancer that we called Cell of Arrest of Cancer and used AML to characterise its validity. The identification of the CAC will permit to study in details leukemic blockage mechanisms in a heterogenous disease as AML. CAC classification will allow to consider new therapeutic approaches including terminal differentiation induction in specific subtypes of AML. Conflict of interest: None Introduction: The detection of several mutations in a blast population of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (pAML) is supposed to be caused by a clonal evolution from a leukemic stem cell (LSC) to leukemic blasts. Since LSC and potential leukemic subclones are only present in small subpopulations, it has been a major technical challenge to particular analyse only the specific population. To acquire a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis, clonal evolution and leukemogenesis, the aim of this study was to establish methods that allow the analysis and detection of mutations in single cells of a subpopulation known to contain HSC as well as LSC (CD34+CD38-). Methods and results: The mutational status of sorted single cells from three patients suffering from pAML was analysed and compared to mutations detected at initial diagnosis in DNA from a bulk of bone marrow (BM) cells. Single CD34+CD38-cells were sorted, applied to Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) and whole exome sequencing. The mutational status was compared to mutations initially detected. WGA from single cells resulted in an amount of 29 to 31.7\u03bcg DNA from each of five single cells. A 4bp insertion in exon 12 of NPM1, (MutA) initially detected from a bulk of cells, was identified in amplified DNA from single cells in 2/3 patients. Internal tandem duplications in Flt3, indicated by mismatches in the alignment, could be detected in amplified DNA from single cells of two patients. The detected ITD resemble those initially detected in DNA from a bulk of BM cells. Conclusion: Single cell sequencing provides a useful tool to amend the detection of genetic aberrations from a bulk of cells and to confirm the presence of specific mutations in single cells from small subpopulations. It therefore helps to get further insights into the clonal evolution in pAML. Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the accumulation of malignant blasts with impaired differentiation due to recurrent mutations, amongst which IDH mutations occur in 15% of AML patients. Methods and results: We showed both in vitro and in a xenografted mice model, that clinically achievable doses of ATRA are sufficient to achieve a terminal granulocytic differentiation, on primary AML samples and AML cell lines harboring IDH1-R132H mutation. There is no effect at this concentration on the WT controls. This is associated with reduction of both proliferation and colony formation, and further lead to apoptosis, improving then overall survival of mutant xenografted mice. We further showed that ATRA sensitivity is due to a constitutive reduced Lyn activation in the presence of the mutation. This will also sensitizes to clinically achievable doses of dasatinib, a Lyn inhibitor. Moreover, as ATRA induces a brief Lyn activation that transiently reduces ATRA activity, its association with dasatinib synergistically increases differentiation. This association might also be considered for others IDH mutations producing 2-hydroxyglutarate, since treatment with the mutantspecific oncometabolite (eg. 2-hydroxyglutarate) sensitizes AML cells to ATRA-induced differentiation. Summary: Constitutive reduction of Lyn in IDH1-R132H blasts sensitizes this subgroup of AML to both dasatinib and ATRA and results in a highly synergistic effect between these two drugs. Conclusion: As ATRA and dasatinib are already used in the clinic, and because IDH mutations are systematically conserved at relapse, combining ATRA to dasatinib should be promising to achieve a long-term remission for this AML patient subgroup. Conflict of interest: None at the time of enrollment into the trial. In 68% of patients, BMI was \u2265 25, and this cut-off level was chosen for further analysis. Both groups were well balanced concerning genetic risk groups but more male patients were overweight. There was no significant difference in CR rates between both groups (60% vs. 58%). However, in younger patients (<60 years), BMI \u2265 25 was significantly associated with reduced OS and RFS as compared to patients with BMI < 25 (OS: 10.0 vs. 4.9 years, p<0.02, RFS: 2.7 vs. 1.8 years, p<0.02). This result was independent from the type of AML (de novo or secondary), karyotype and FLT3 mutation. Also, BMI conferred a worse prognosis in AML with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics and in patients with FLT3-ITD. Multivariate analysis confirmed the increased risk for younger overweight patients of 28% for OS. Interestingly, RNA expression analysis in 474 patients showed not one single differently expressed gene in AML blasts from overweight patients, making overweight a truly independent prognostic factor. Discussion: This analysis establishes overweight as an independent negative prognostic factor in younger patients with AML. This is of particular importance since overweight is the only factor that could be altered in during the course of treatment. Further research is needed to clarify if overweight correction could improve prognosis. Conflict of interest: None Background: Besides genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are recognized as an additional mechanism contributing to AML. To identify marker genes that may provide a basis for improved patient outcome prediction, diagnosis and prognosis we performed a systematically genome-wide screening of DNA methylation profiles across 23.000 CpG islands of 28 AML samples using the Methyl-CpG-Immunoprecipitation assay combined to CpG island microarrays. These profiles were then used to select a subset of aberrantly methylated CpG islands (380 regions covering 15.000 CpGs) for quantitative DNA methylation profiling in a larger cohort of 196 AML patients using MALDI-TOF analysis of bisulfite-treated DNA. Meta-analysis clearly separated a subgroup of CpG island regions showing highly correlated DNA methylation changes that were also marked by H3K27me3 in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). The residual group of CGIs not targeted by polycomb group repressors in HPC displayed heterogeneous methylation patterns across patients that clustered with genetic markers. A fraction of AML patients (5/196) displayed aberrant hypermethylation at almost all studied loci, representing a rare CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in AML. These patients present immature leukemia with various chromosomal aberrations but very few mutations and show high resemblance with a recently reported CEBPA methylated subgroup displaying a similar strong methylation signature (Figueroa et al, 2009 ). DNA methylation analysis revealed that most of these CEBPA-silenced cases fall into our CIMP category. Method: To explore the whole range of epigenetic alterations in this rare group of hypermethylated patients we performed in-depth global DNA methylation analyses. Interestingly, hyper-rmethylated gene promoters represent many transcriptional regulators that are involved in the differentiation of myeloid lineages (e.g. CEBPA, IRF8, GATA2). In addition, these patients frequently show hypermethylation of the TET2 promoter which could result in a loss of maintenance DNA demethylation and therefore successive hypermethylation at CGIs. Conclusion: It is likely that the aberrant silencing of key lineage regulators stabilizes the differentiation arrest in these cells, and that these patients may particularly benefit from therapies that revert DNA methylation. Conflict of interest: None In our study, we have described 7 pts. among clean-up workers with various cytological variants of AML (AML with minimal differentiation, acute myelomonocytic leukemia and acute erythroid leukemia) in whom the overt leukemia was preceded by MDS (15.2% of all AML cases diagnosed in clean-up workers). At the same time, only six (1.5%) cases of preceding MDS were found upon examination of AML patients in general population of Ukraine in our study. Conclusion: Study of the secondary MDS and its relation to AML in post-Chernobyl period seems to be relevant taking into account the data suggesting that MDS risk among A-bomb survivors remains to be significantly increased even in 55-60 years after radiation exposure.

However, the underlying mechanisms still remain incompletely understood. Here we report that loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and subsequent reduction of H3K27 trimethylation contribute to chemoresistance in AML. Method: In Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) EZH2 is often inactivated due to mutations which is associated with poor prognosis. By use of quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry we show that a decrease of EZH2 mRNA and protein also correlated with a poor prognosis of AML patients indicating a tumor suppressor role of EZH2 in AML. EZH2 is located on chromosome 7q36.1 and it is not yet fully clear whether EZH2 expression is affected in MDS and AML patients with del(7)/del(7q) who are largely refractory to chemotherapy and have a poor prognosis. We found EZH2 levels to be reduced in del(7)/del(7q) AML patients as determined by Western Blot. Notably, the reduction of EZH2 protein levels via treatment with H3K27 Methyltransferase inhibitors or lentiviral knockdown was sufficient to induce chemoresistance of Normal Karyotype (NK)-AML cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, we observed that EZH2 loss occurred during the acquisition of drug resistance in a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-and Cytarabine-resistant AML cell line. Functionally, the loss of EZH2 directly induced upregulation of HOX genes, which suggests a stem-cell-like signature to be associated with the resistance phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and treatment with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, respectively, increased EZH2 protein levels and restored drug sensitivity of the resistant cell line. To evaluate the effect of Bortezomib on EZH2 levels in patients`blasts we treated NK-AML blasts ex vivo with Bortezomib. Importantly, in those patient samples in which EZH2 protein levels were increased by Bortezomib we observed a significantly increased cell death. Conclusion: Our data strongly indicate that restoration of EZH2 protein levels e.g. via Proteasome inhibitors and thereby restoration of EZH2 function might be a novel promising approach to increase therapy response in AML. Background: The cytogenetically cryptic t(5;11)(q35;p15.4) is a frequently observed chromosomal aberration in AML, which results in the translocation of the NUP98 and NSD1 genes and expression of a NUP98-NSD1 fusion protein. Due to its association with poor prognosis and dismal clinical outcome, there has been increasing interest to improve the identification, therapy and minimal residual disease monitoring of patients with NUP98-NSD1. Method: In the present study, we applied next generation RNA-sequencing, aCGH and molecular cloning techniques together with capillary sequencing to study NUP98-NSD1 fusion transcripts in adult de novo AML patients with t(5;11)(q35;p15.4). By sequencing full-length NUP98-NSD1 cDNA transcripts cloned from the leukemic patient cells, we were able to identify two in-frame transcripts and one out-of-frame transcript. One of the in-frame transcripts joined NUP98 exon 11 to NSD1 exon 6, while the other joined NUP98 exon 12 to NSD1 exon 6. The latter had intra-exonic splice variation at the end of NUP98 exon 7. The out-offrame transcript joining NUP98 exon 12 to NSD1 exon 6 lacked NSD1 exon 7. The relative expression levels of all transcripts were assessed from the RNA-seq data based on aligned read counts. The RNA-seq data indicated that the in-frame transcripts are expressed at a higher level than the out-of-frame transcript, while also indicating that the transcript joining NUP98 exon 12 to NSD1 exon 6 is the predominant transcript. Background: BCL2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis. BCL2 and BCLXL promote survival by preventing mitochondrial proteasome inhibitors than wild type samples (n=13) (mean IC50 42nM vs 170nM) and this sensitivity is strongly correlated with a higher FLT3-ITD allelic burden (p=0.0084, r=-0.719).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "12"}, {"text": "We uncovered by immunoblotting, electron microscopy and confocal analyses that proteasome inhibitors induce autophagy in AML cells which is responsible for the early degradation of FLT3-ITD leading to the inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling and to cell death. Moreover, proteasome inhibitors overcome resistance to quizartinib (a potent second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor) induced by mutations in the kinase domain of FLT3, suggesting that these compounds may prevent the emergence of mutant clones arising from tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments. Finally, in vivo studies using a mouse xenograft model, confirmed that bortezomib was able to decrease FLT3-ITD protein level and to inhibit leukemic cell growth. Conclusion: Therefore, selecting patients according to FLT3-ITD mutations could be a new way to detect a significant clinical activity of proteasome inhibitors in AML patients Conflict of interest: None Background: Recent data suggest that TRK (tropomyosin-related kinase) signalling might contribute to the pathogenesis of mastocytosis by autocrine and paracrine loops. We have recently demonstrated a potential role of neurotrophins including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TRK signalling in leukemia development. Material and methods: In the present study, 57 C57BL/6J mice were transplanted with retrovially gene-modified primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (TRKB/BDNF=17, TRKB=8, BDNF=5, tCD34=7 in 3 independent experiments, and TRKA/NGF=8, TRKA=6, NGF=6 in 2 independent experiments). Interestingly, lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in 5 animals with co-expression of TRKB/BDNF, whereas the other 12 animals unexpectedly developed systemic mastocytosis (SM), affecting mainly spleen, liver, and bone marrow with multifocal compact mast cell infiltrates. Mast cells demonstrated mainly features of mature hyper-granular mast cells. Most SM animals followed an indolent course, while leukemic mice survived <6 months after transplantation. In contrast, no animals with TRKB alone, BDNF alone or tCD34 showed SM or other hematological malignancies. These data strongly suggest that activation of TRKB by BDNF is important to promote mastocytosis. Interestingly, the frequency of SM disease in Kit D816V transgenic mice was lower than in our model (8/28=29% vs. 12/17=71%), whereas retroviralmediated expression of Kit D816V even failed to induce SM in transplanted animals. Five out of 8 animals co-expression of TRKA/NGF developed acute leukemia (mainly mixed phenotype acute leukemia and erythroleukemia). It is interesting to know whether the remaining 3 animals from the TRKA/NGF group will also develop mastocytosis. Conclusion: In summary, we provide the first direct evidence for induction of mastocytosis by activation of TRKB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vivo. Our data indicate an important role of TRK receptors in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia and mastocytosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Method:"}, {"text": "with significantly longer latency. Recently, SRC was identified as a crucial interaction partner of FLT3-ITD for STAT5 activation. Method: Here, we have investigated the role of STAT5 for the latency and phenotype of the FLT3-mutant induced diseases using a conditional Stat5 knockout approach. Our studies proved that STAT5 is necessary for the induction of a MPN by FLT3-ITD, while FLT3-TKD is not dependent on activation of STAT5. Mice with deletion of the Stat5 allele displayed expansion of lymphoid cells with an increased latency similar to the FLT3-TKD disease. In additional experiments, we were able to show differential activation of STAT5 in myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. Furthermore, Oncostatin M, a STAT5 target gene, is exclusively expressed in Flt3-ITD + myeloid progenitor cells and in Flt3-ITD + mice with intact Stat5. Strikingly, we could show that FLT3-TKD expression in combination with Oncostatin M is sufficient to induce a MPN, pointing to a pivotal role of STAT5 for induction of FLT3-induced myeloid neoplasms. Furthermore, significantly elevated Src expression levels could be detected in proliferating myeloid progenitor cells compared to lymphoid progenitors. Background: Leukemia-associated-immuno-phenotypes (LAIP) defined by multiparameter flow cytometry (MPFC) are present at diagnosis i\u00f1 90% of Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AML) and are used to identify and measure MRD. We assessed in parallel LAIP profiles and gene mutational status in AML to better identify patients at high risk of relapse. Screening for FLT3 mutations is relevant for patient risk stratification and recent studies suggest that relapse of FLT3-ITD AML may originate from very small subclones which are undetectable at diagnosis using conventional techniques. Method: We have previously developed a patient-specific real-time quantitative PCR (ps-RQ-PCR) to implement FLT3-ITD detection, however this approach is not applicable at diagnosis to detect minor subclones. To improve detection of small populations harboring FLT3-ITD and potentially associated to chemoresistance, 9-color MPFC and molecular analyses were used in parallel. Within the CD34+ve cell fraction, we identified a discrete population expressing high-levels of the IL-3 receptor alpha-chain (CD123) and MIC-2 (CD99) in combination with the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25). The presence of this population positively correlated with FLT3 mutations. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed that within the CD34+ve cell fraction, a percentage of CD123/CD99/CD25+ve cells\u226511.7% predicted FLT3 mutations with a specificity and sensitivity of >90%. CD34/CD123/CD99/ CD25+ve clones were retrospectively evaluated and detected at presentation in 3 patients with FLT3wt/NPM1+ AML, who relapsed with FLT3-ITD/NPM1+ AML. The ps-RQ-PCR designed for each FLT3-ITD confirmed the presence of low copy numbers of the mutation in diagnostic samples in all three cases. Finally, MPFC revealed that the CD34/CD123/CD99/CD25+ve population correlated with absent or low CD38 expression, suggesting that this LAIP may identify leukemia initiating cells. Results: Our data show that patients with FLT3-wild type/NPM1+ AML by routine PCR who carry at diagnosis a CD34/CD123/CD99/CD25+ subpopulation likely harbor small FLT3-ITD subclones potentially associated with chemoresistance and disease relapse. We propose that such patients are kept under \"special surveillance\" and stringently monitored for possible emergence of FLT3-ITD after remission induction and during follow-up. Purpose: Cancer cells emit microvesicles to their microenvironment to represent an important mode of intercellular communication by serving as vehicles for transfer cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs. Since, microRNA21 is overexpressed in leukemia, this study considered the effect of microvesicles from leukemic microenvironment on microRNA21 expression in umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells. Methods: Umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells sorted by MACS (CD34 antibody), were treated with 30 ug microvesicles isolated from bone marrow samples of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in diagnosis phase (written consent form was obtained) and were divided to three groups: 1) control group without microvesicles, 2) normal group treated with microvesicles from normal bone marrow samples and 3) leukemia group treated with microvesicles from leukemic bone marrow samples. Cell count, qPCR for microRNA21 expression and flowcytometry analysis for CD34 and viability test were performed after 7days. Results: Number of cells in leukemia group showed a significant increase in comparison with other both groups (P<0.05). Also, 2.7 fold change of microRNA21 expression was observed in leukemia group (P<0.01). Surface CD34 results did not show any significant different among all studied groups in comparison with 97% CD34 in day0 sorted hematopoietic stem cells (P>0.05). Cell viability test done by 7AAD was more than 90% in all groups. Conclusion: This study showed that microvesicles from leukemic microenvironment are able to deregulate microRNA21 expression in cord blood hematopoietic stem cells. Recent reports indicate this might be due to different subcellular localization and downstream signaling of the various FLT3 mutants. However, it remains unclear whether FLT3-ITD receptors are consistently retained within intracellular compartments or whether they are rapidly internalized after ligand stimulation. Therefore, we set out to study the differential localization of FLT3 mutants. Methods: FLT3 mutants, namely N676K, D835Y, K644R and two different ITDs, were expressed in U2OS or BaF3 cells and analyzed by confocal and high resolution microscopy in combination with immunofluorescence (IF). To study the subcellular localization of FLT3 and to determine qualitative and quantitative differences upon ligand stimulation we used subdiffraction multicolor 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM). The FLT3 trafficking/activation kinetics are analyzed by live cell microscopy utilizing a spinning disc microscope. Imaging conditions are optimized for fluorescently tagged expression constructs (FLT3-GFP/ FLT3-RFP), as well as tetracysteine motif tagged expression constructs allowing successive pulse labelling with two different colors. FLT3 inhibition is performed using PKC412 and AC220. Results: Our IF staining confirmed a predominant ER-localization of FLT3-ITD, whereas FLT3 wildtype and point mutations localize to the cell membrane. While ITD activates STAT5 signaling, N676K and D835Y activate the MAPK pathway. Summary: Disease relapse remains a major cause of mortality for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by normal and leukemic myeloid progenitors and 25% of AML cases harbor a FLT3-ITD mutation, associated with an even inferior outcome due to increased relapse rate. AML relapse might be correlated to interactions between leukemic blasts and the bone marrow microenvironment (e.g. hypoxia), promoting leukaemia survival e.g. chemo-resistance. Hence, the effects of hypoxia on FLT3 expression could provide novel insight into relapse biology. Material and methods: Patient samples and the murine pro-B-cell line Ba/f3, stably transfected with FLT3-WT and with different FLT3-ITD mutants (W51, W78, NPOS) were used. Experiments were carried out in parallel under standard laboratory conditions and reduced oxygen environment of 1% O 2 . Applied methods comprise cell culture, flow cytometry (cell cycle analysis, apoptosis), real-time PCR and western blot. Survival analyses were done according to the method of Kaplan-Meier. Results: AML patients samples were cultured under hypoxic conditions for 48 hours and 40% (n=6) of those expressing FLT3, showed a down-regulation of total FLT3 protein level independent on the mutational state. This finding could not be observed in any human AML cell line screened (n=14), however both Ba/f3 WT and all three ITD mutants checked showed FLT3 down-regulation after 72 hours at 1% O 2 . This was accompanied by a significant decrease in cell growth as compared to 21% O 2, without significant increase in apoptosis. Real-Time PCR analysis showed no difference in the transcriptional regulation of FLT3 under 1% O 2 compared to 21% O 2. Susceptibility against FLT3-TKI was unaffected despite decreased FLT3 expression. Interestingly, half-life of FLT3 protein was shorter at 1% O 2 (1 hr) as compared to 21% O 2 (2 hrs). Degradation of FLT3-ITD is mediated by proteasome, which could reliably be inhibited under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Re-oxygenation of hypoxic AML blasts with 21% O 2 revealed that down-regulation of FLT-3 is reversible within 24 hours. The mechanisms of down-regulation for FLT3 seem to be complex: degradation is certainly mediated by proteasome and seems not to be transcriptionally dependent. Clinically, FLT3 regulation status might be of prognostic importance (n=8, relapse free survival (RFS) for non-regulators 2.2 months versus 10.0 months for regulators, p=0.07). Conclusion: This data shows that hypoxia influences FLT3 expression in primary patient samples and the Ba/f3 model. The functional consequences are still unknown, but patients that fail to down-regulate FLT3 tend to have a shorter RFS. The mechanisms involved in down-regulation comprise a proteasome-dependent degradation. Ongoing projects focus on molecular mechanisms responsible for oxygen-dependent regulation of FLT3 and on biological consequences. Conflict of interest: none Purpose: This study comprehensively records the kinetics of global gene expression changes that accompany the transition from a normal hematopoietic precursor to a transformed pre-leukemic cell. Employing MLL-fusion transformed cells as a paradigma of hematopoietic transformation the hierarchy and wiring of control circuits governing the decision between self-renewal and differentiation are visualized. Methods and results: With the help of a knock-in model introducing a conditional MLL-fusion oncogene into the mouse germ-line we are presenting a \"reverse-engineering\"strategy that allows kinetic sampling of the \"transformed to normal\" transition. By determination of global transcription rates through nascent RNA sequencing coupled with genome-wide ChIP-Seq probing for oncogene presence and function we identify the crucial downstream mediators of MLL-fusion induced transformation. Combining kinetics with occupancy data allows to discriminate drivers from bystanders. Thus novel players, pathways and principles determining the transforming activity of MLL fusion proteins could be identified. Biological verification experiments involving a select set of hitherto unknown MLL-fusion targets confirmed their role in MLL-induced transformation and revealed the importance of pathways including stable RNA-synthesis, splicing and control of metabolism that had not yet been associated with transformation by MLL-fusion proteins. This comprehensive knowledge of the MLL-triggered transforming network will allow for the rational design of novel inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategies. Conclusion: MLL-fusions are multifunctional oncoproteins that control a discrete and highly redundant network of control circuits that cooperate to keep hematopoietic precursors in an undifferentiated state. The analysis strategy applied in this work can be universally adapted for other oncogenes facilitating the elucidation of different transforming principles. 6 Dept. of Pediatrics, Univ. of Regensburg; 7 Dept. of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Univ. of T\u00fcbingen, Germany; 8 Dept. of Pediatric Intensive Care Medicine, UKBB Basel; Switzerland, 9 Dept. of Oncology, Dr von Haunersches Kinderspital, LMU M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany", "cite_spans": [{"start": 11538, "end": 11539, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 11582, "end": 11583, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 11652, "end": 11653, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 11723, "end": 11724, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Method:"}, {"text": "Purpose: In the individualized xenograft mouse model of AML, primary patients' AML cells are transplanted into immunocompromised mice. We aimed at improving this model to enable reproducible, sensitive and reliable disease monitoring for preclinical treatment trials. Methods: Primary AML patient cells were engrafted in immunocompromized NSG mice and serially retransplanted. Patientderived xenografted (PDX) cells were lentivirally transduced in vitro to express a fluorochrome and enhanced firefly luciferase. Transgenic t-PDX cells were enriched by flow cytometry, reinjected into mice, and monitored over time using bioluminescence in vivo imaging (BLI). Mice were treated in preclinical treatment trials; effect of drugs on leukemia burden was monitored by BLI. Results: About 30% of primary AML patient samples allow serial transplant-ation in NSG mice and thereby generation of stable PDX cells. PDX cells were derived from genetically distinct patient samples, mimicking the known heterogeneity of AML. Targeted resequencing of 43 genes important for AML leukemogenesis revealed identical mutations in primary and PDX cells after initial or serial transplantation, besides two losses of minor suclones. Until now, five PDX samples were genetically engineering by lentiviral transduction. Recombinant expression of luciferase enabled BLI for reliable follow up of leukemia growth in mice. Imaging was highly sensitive and detected t-PDX cells on MRD level (10 -4 leukemic cells within mouse BM). Furthermore, imaging facilitated reliable analysis of preclinical treatment trials, visualizing drug effects in single mice over time. Introduction: Hematological disorders such as leukemia are associated with disruptions of the microenvironment within the bone marrow (BM) niche. The aim of this study was to establish a 3D perfusion culture system for leukemic cells and human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which constitute an important supportive cellular component of the bone marrow niche. Methods: We used a modular perfusion culture system (Will W. Minuth, Regensburg, Germany). MSC were cultured on porous membrane filters consisting of mixed cellulose which were permanently perfused with fresh culture medium. The viability and induction of apoptosis of the MSCs and leukemic cells in different culture conditions was tested. Results: A perfusion rate of 20.8 \u03bcl per minute and a concentration of 50 mM HEPES buffer were observed to be optimal. We could show that the amount of viable MSCs cultured in perfusion culture was considerably higher (OD 450 : 0.37 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.2 \u00b1 0.01) than in conventional cell culture. The basal level of apoptotic cells in a co-cultivation of MSC and a leukemic cell line is 1.7x increased in conventional cell culture compared to perfusion culture. MSC showed no differences in the expression of exemplary chosen genes relevant for the BM niche (CXCL12, Jag1) due to the different culture conditions. Additionally, MSC cultured on membranes formed 3D-like networks. No differences in morphology were observed with respect to the different culture conditions. Discussion and conclusion: The 3D perfusion culture system is sufficient to increase the viability and proliferation of MSC without changing the gene expression profile of exemplary chosen genes. The system can be used for further experiments including co-culturing experiments with MSCs and leukemic blasts and might be an important option to mimic the hematopoietic stem cell niche in vitro.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Method:"}, {"text": "The DNA-Repair Machinery as a Novel Target in a Humanized T(8;21)+ Pre-Leukemia Model with Activated C-KIT C.

Henschler 2 1 Georg-Speyer-Haus -Frankfurt, Germany; 2 Ludwig Maximilian University Hospital, A\u00f6R, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology -Munich, Germany Introduction: The RUNX1/ETO fusion protein, which originates from the t(8;21) chromosomal rearrangement, is one of the most frequent translocation products found in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In RUNX1/ETO leukemias, activated forms of the c-KIT tyrosine kinase receptor are frequently found, thereby suggesting oncogenic cooperativity between these oncoproteins in the development and maintenance of t(8;21) malignancies. Method and discussion: We show that activated c-KIT cooperates with RUNX1/ETO to expand human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells ex vivo. Morphologically and cytometrically, CD34+ cells expressing both oncogenes precisely resemble the AML-M2 myeloblastic leukemia cell phenotype. In contrast, RUNX1/ETO-expressing cells largely undergo granulocytic differentiation. Oncogenic c-KIT amplifies RUNX1/ETO-depended clonogenic growth and protects cells from exhaustion. Of note, activated c-KIT reverts the RUNX1/ETO-induced DNA-damage followed by apoptosis, a recently described RUNX1/ETOdependent phenomenon. In the presence of activated c-KIT, RUNX1/ ETO-downregulated DNA-repair genes including OGG1 and BRAC2 are re-expressed leading to an enhancement of DNA-repair efficiency via homologous recombination. Through this mechanism activated c-KIT protects from RUNX1/ETO-induced cellular stress. This points to a direct link between the high frequency of mutated c-KIT and the occurrence of t(8;21) and herewith provides a rational mechanism of oncogenic cooperativity and drug resistance. Results: Together, our results provide new mechanistic insight into RUNX1/ETO and c-KIT oncogenic cooperativity in human primary CD34+ progenitors and suggest that augmented DNA-repair might account for the increased chemoresistance and decreased overall survival rates observed in t(8;21)-positive AML patients with activated c-KIT mutations. This cell protective mechanism represents a new therapeutic target, as RUNX1/ETO cells with activated c-KIT are highly sensitive to pharmacological inhibitors of DNA-repair. Introduction: The discovery of new drugs and drug targets can help to improve the cure rates of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitors represent a group of promising compounds for AML treatment because leukemic cells have altered genome methylation, as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes promoters. Method: The present study aims the in vitro evaluation of two DNMTs inhibitors, called B and Q that are nanaomycin A analogs. Cytotoxic activity was carried out in K562 AML cell line by XTT reduction assay, performed 48 hours after addition of compounds increasing concentrations. Enzymatic activity inhibition of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and DNMT3B were accessed by Western Blot technique followed by quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, we investigated the methylation of CpG islands located in promoter regions of six tumor suppressor genes, by pyrosequencing, before and after treatment with both compounds. Discussion: K562 showed an IC50 of 10,4uM and 6,6uM for compounds B and Q respectively. At protein level, the treatment with B compound resulted in decrease of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B levels while Q treatment resulted in decreased DNMT1 and increased DNMT3B isoforms, when compared to control sample (DMSO). At mRNA level, the treatment with B showed a decreased DNMT1 with no significant alteration on DNMT3B while the Q treatment showed a decreased DNMT1. We also verified an increased DNMT3B mRNA level when cells were treated with Q compound at 0,5\u03bcM. Regarding methylation of tumor suppressor genes promoters, we observed that no ESR1 and RASSF1 genes promoters were methylated in K562 cells since methylation levels of these promoters in control cells (DMSO) were also very low. CADM1, Mir141, MGMT and THBS1 promoter regions showed methylated patterns, however no difference in methylation of these regions was observed between treated and control cells. Conclusion: We concluded that compounds B and Q were both cytotoxic for K562 cell line and decreased DNMT1 protein levels. Besides, compound B also decreased DNMT3b protein levels. Currently, we are working on DNMT1 and DNMT3B in vitro inhibition assay to elucidate the compounds mechanisms of action and on K562 gene expression profiles to understand some of the genes pathways affected by these compounds. Background: MLL-translocations are frequent in infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Their leukemogenic potential is widely accepted, but unfortunately MLL-fusions are not amenable to therapeutic intervention. We thus set out to identify novel therapeutic targets downstream of MLL-AF9 with the prospect to improve the still unsatisfactory prognosis of MLL+ AML. Methods: Gene expression profiles were generated and bioinformatically interpreted after efficient and specific silencing of endogenous MLL-AF9 in THP1 (AML) cells. Results: A strategy to prioritize genes which mediate MLL-AF9 leukemogenic effects resulted in a set of 41 out of hundreds of differentially regulated genes. Seven of these qualified as druggable and thus could offer novel therapeutic targets for MLL+ AML. We show that targeting one of the encoded proteins, the dopamine receptor D5, was able to reduce leukemic cell characteristics of THP1 cells.

A 62 year old man was admitted to our department with fever, abdominal pain and jaundice due to a common bile duct mass constricting the choledochus duct.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 5796, "end": 5797, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "34"}, {"text": "Method: After endoscopic stent implantation, an explorative laparotomy with cholecystectomy lead to diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma with involvement of cholecystis and choledochus. Further tumor manifestations, in particular bone marrow infiltration, were excluded. Due to present febrile cholestasis subcutaneous low dose Cytarabine (LDAC, 20mg/bid) together with broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Staging after one cycle of LDAC documented a significant tumor mass reduction, thus two intensive chemotherapy cycles with Idarubicin, Cytarabine, and Etoposide were performed. During both aplasia periods a biliary drainage change and broad antimicrobical therapy were required because of febrile cholestasis. Consequent re-staging documented a complete remission (CR), therefore a consolidation radiotherapy with 24 Gy was added. After four months of follow-up (FU) fever and petechial skin due to piastrinopenia and leucocytosis with 74% of myeloid blast in peripheral blood appeared. Intensive chemotherapy induced a CR of the AML, thus a second consolidation cycle was performed, both complicated by febrile cholestasis requiring again biliary drainage replacement. Given the fact that a CR of AML and MS was obtained, a semi-intensive Daunorubicin/ Citarabin cycle was given and after myeloablative chemotherapy hematopietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) with peripheral blood stem cells from a 10/10 matched unrelated donor realized. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis contained Ciclosporin, Methotrexate and antithymoglobulin. The aplasia period was complicated by fever without cholestasis. During the recovery the drainage was not opened and the patient could be discharged after 21 days. The patient is currently at 4 month FU maintaining a CR of AML with 100% chimerism and no MS or infection signs. Purpose: Conventional cytogenetic analysis is a mandatory component of AML workup. In older pts (>60 y), presence of adverse cytogenetic changes is associated with poor response to standard induction chemotherapy and short overall survival. Conventional cytogenetic studies are time-consuming, and therapeutic decisions are often delayed until the karyotyping result is available. Thus, we investigated whether a targeted FISH screening would allow the rapid identification of the most common unfavorable chromosomal changes in AML. Patients and methods: We studied 318 newly diagnosed AML pts (263 pts>60 y). Conventional cytogenetic analyses were performed using standard techniques. For FISH analyses probes directed against 7 genomic loci were used: 5p15.2 (D5S721, D5S23), 5q31 (EGR1), 7cen (D7Z1), 7q31 (D7S486), 17p13 (TP53), 17cen (D17Z1) and 3q26.2 (EVI1). The result was considered positive if the signal pattern was consistent with one of the following abnormalities: del(5)(q31) or -5, -7, abn(17p13) or -17, or inv(3)/t(3;3). Results: FISH screening was positive in 75 pts, and 73/75 belonged to the ELN adverse genetic group. Thus, a positive FISH result indicated the adverse karyotype in 97% of cases (pos. predictive value). Contrary, 21 out of 243 FISH neg pts belonged to the adverse group according to their karyotype. These pts mostly carried complex structural changes without involvement of chromosome 5, 7, or 17. Conclusion: The median time from receipt of the specimen until the FISH screening result became available was two days. Our targeted screening assay using a limited number of FISH probes could rapidly identify a large majority of older AML pts with unfavorable cytogenetics and represents a valuable addition to the standard genetic workup of AML. As an additional warranty to minimize the probability of relapse accepted the need to intensify therapy in patients with the expression of the interleukin 2 receptor alpha (CD25) clonal blast cells. Algorithm for risk-adapted induction therapy is as follows. When the content of CD25 + cells before treatment and at least 10% in the absence (0%) of cells with LAF after the first course of remission induction therapy protocol \"7 + 3\" with escalated doses of anthracyclines (in 14 days from start of treatment) were limited to one course of induction remission, the patient is transferred to consolidation remission therapy with high-dose cytarabine protocol HiDAC. When the content of CD25 + cells before treatment and at least 10% of cells with LAF on day 14 of 0.01% or more was conducted two courses of remission induction protocol \"7 + 3\", and the first course with escalated, and the second with standard doses of anthracyclines. When the content of CD25 + cells prior to treatment is 10% or more and no (0%) cells at day 14 LAF performed two cycles of remission induction protocol \"7 + 3\", a first course with escalated, and a second standard doses of anthracycline . When the content of CD25 + cells before treatment to 10% or more, and cells LAF on day 14 of 0.01% or more, conducted two courses of induction of remission, the first course protocol \"7 + 3\" with escalated doses of anthracyclines, and the second course FLAG-Ida. Result: As a result of applying this algorithm frequency cytomorphological complete remission was 89.5% complete remissions cytomorphological and immunophenotypic -84%. Conflict of interest: None Purpose: The Hedgehog pathway plays an important role in stem-cell biology and malignant transformation. Therefore we investigated expression and prognostic impact of Hedgehog pathway members in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: Pre-treatment samples from 104 newly diagnosed AML patients (AMLSG 07-04 trial) were analyzed by qPCR and expression of Hedgehog family members was correlated to clinical outcome. Inhibition of GLI by GANT61 or shRNA was investigated in AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Results: Expression of receptors SMO and PTCH1 and their downstream mediators GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 was detected in AML patients while no expression of Hedgehog ligands was found.GLI2 expression had a significant negative influence on event-free (EFS), relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS; p=0.037, p=0.026 and p=0.013, respectively) and was correlated to FLT3 mutational status (p<0.001). Analysis of a second, independent patient cohort confirmed the negative impact of GLI2 on EFS and OS (p=0.007 and p=0.003, respectively; n=290). Within this cohort, also GLI1 had a negative prognostic impact (p<0.001 for both EFS and OS). Although AML cells did not express Hedgehog ligands, AML patients had significantly increased Desert Hedgehog (DHH) plasma levels compared to healthy subjects (p=0.002). Provision of DHH could be ascribed to BM niche cells which showed elevated DHH expression levels compared to the whole cell BM compartment. Moreover, the GLI inhibitor GANT61 or knockdown of GLI1/2 by shRNA caused anti-leukemic effects including induction of apoptosis, reduced proliferation and colony formation in AML cells and a survival benefit in a mouse model. Results: Feeder cells only slightly prevented spontaneous cells death of patient-derived ALL cells in vitro. While several cytotoxic drugs induced marked apoptosis when used in clinically relevant concentrations in vitro in the absence of feeder cells, the presence of feeder cells markedly reduced apoptosis induction. In certain drugs, reduction of apoptosis by feeders was up to 50 %. Conclusion: From our data we conclude that the environment inherits major inhibitory effects on drug sensitivity of ALL cells and should be considered in novel treatment protocols for ALL. Here, we aimed to functionally discriminate clonal subpopulations in order to link adverse characteristics. Towards this aim, we characterized several single cell clones regarding their functional properties in vitro and in vivo using tumor cells from a patient with ALL. Method: We amplified the patient's ALL cells in immuno-compromised mice within the individualized xenograft mouse model. RGB marking enabled multicolor staining of patient-derived xenograft ALL cells based on lentiviral genetic engineering; RGB marking allowed isolation of individually colored viable single cell clones from the ALL patient. Results: Single cell clones were characterized for their functional properties in vitro and in vivo as well as for phenotypic markers. When 2 differently RGB marked clones were mixed within the same recipient mice, one clone overgrew the other indicating different proliferation rates of both clones. In vitro, chemosensitivity clearly differed between several clones tested, especially regarding stimulation with glucocorticoids, indicating that resistant subclones existed before start of treatment. Introduction: Treatment resistance and relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are considered to be due to apoptosis defects. Since inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs') negatively regulating apoptosis signaling are highly expressed in leukemias, small molecule inhibitor antagonists (SMAC mimetic, SM) provide a promising strategy to overcome apoptosis deficiency and effectively treat high risk ALL. In this study, we addressed and characterized effects and effectivity of SM in ALL. Method: Exposure of ALL cells to SM at nanomolar concentrations led to clear cell death induction in ALL cell lines and 70% of primograft ALL samples (n=42). Interestingly, apoptosis induction could be inhibited by the soluble TNF-a receptor etanercept, thus indicating TNF-a dependency. Previously, we described that rapid NOD/SCID/huALL engraftment is associated with deficient apoptosis signaling and indicative for early patient relapse. Importantly, SM activated constitutive deficient apoptosis signaling in high risk/early relapse ALL. Next, we investigated the effectivity of SM on high risk ALL in a preclinical in vivo setting and treated leukemia bearing recipients either with vehicle, SM, multidrug chemotherapy, or a combination of both. Results: Importantly, a profound reduction of tumor load and prolonged survival of animals was observed upon SM treatment alone, and even more pronounced in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Interestingly, concomitant in vivo application of etanercept revoked the SM effect, indicating that SM induced apoptosis sensitization involves signaling via TNF-a also in vivo, thereby pointing to a potential biomarker for the identification of patients who would benefit from SM treatment. Conclusion: In conclusion, the small molecule SM induce cell death ex vivo and in vivo in primary patient-derived ALL overcoming apoptosis deficiency, pointing to a novel strategy for targeted therapy of high-risk ALL. Background: Expression of meningioma 1 (MN1) gene can be associated with ATRA resistance. Purpose of the study was to investigate MN1 expression levels in patients (pts) with ALL treated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on the protocol ALL-MB-2008. 1 that in relapsed APL patients (treated upfront with ATO) mutations in the B2 domain of PML in PML-RARA gene are involved in resistance and poor clinical outcome (NEJM 2014). We had previously reported that Bortezomib (Bo) was able to synergize with ATO by inducing apoptosis (Blood. 2012;120 ,3552). We further evaluated the mechanism of degradation of PML-RARA when ATO was combined with Bo. Method and results: We generated in-house ATO resistant NB4 cell lines (NB4EV-ASR1 (with A216V mutation), ASR2 and ASR3). The combination of ATO and Bo induced a significant apoptosis in the resistant cells similar to na\u00efve NB4 cells. We observed a time dependent accumulation and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and ubiquitin binding protein p62 in ATO+Bo treated na\u00efve NB4 cells, correlating with induction of autophagy and degradation of PML-RARA. Similar results were seen in the resistant cells. Blocking autophagy by 3-methyl adenine or knock down of p62 showed an accumulation of PML-RARA in the combination treated cells. We also observed an interaction between P62,LC3II and PML-RARA suggesting that PML-RARA was cleared by autophagy via p62 protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 10817, "end": 10818, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest: None"}, {"text": "In a transplantable APL mice model, combination prolonged the life span of the mice. A reduction in the LIC was demonstrated by secondary transplantation experiments. A phase II clinical study combining Bo with ATO and chemotherapy has been initiated for relapsed APL (NCT01950611). 11 patients have been enrolled, all achieved complete molecular remission. The combination was well tolerated. Beyond induction the combination does not require in-patient care and there is no significant cytopenia. Background: Mass cytometry allows for multi-parametric analysis of single cells to distinguish phenotypic and functional features of subpopulations from leukemia samples. Mass cytometric analysis of pediatric Ph+ BCP ALL constructs a novel model of ALL organized along the normal B cell developmental trajectory that may be used as a lens through which to examine signaling features, drug response, and clinical data. Methods: Mononuclear cells from diagnostic bone marrow samples were obtained from pediatric patients with BCP-ALL (n=52) or healthy controls (n=6). Mass cytometry analysis of 40 proteins was performed at baseline state and perturbed state (cytokines and tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Healthy bone marrow samples were gated as previously described along the trajectory of developing B cells (Davis et al., 2014) . These populations were used as the foundation for a classifier in which each leukemia cell was assigned to its nearest healthy population based on Mahalanobis distance in nine dimensions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1306, "end": 1326, "text": "(Davis et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Conflict of interest: None"}, {"text": "Results: ALL samples demonstrated phenotypic heterogeneity but maintained features consistent with stages of healthy B cell development. The single-cell classifier assigned each cell to its most related healthy B cell population. Across all samples, leukemic cells preferentially straddled the preproB cell to preB1 transition with expansion of these compartments at the expense of progenitor and immature B cell compartments. Each leukemia had a distinct occupancy of the developmental trajectory. Within the developmental compartments, blast cells retained functional features of their healthy counterparts including developmental enzymes TdT and RAG as well as transcription factors (Ikaros, PAX5). Activation of relevant signaling pathways including JAK-STAT and PI3K signaling was assessed in each compartment. Response to TKI's varied based on developmental compartment of the blasts. Finally, the association between state of developmental arrest and clinical features (age, MRD, relapse, genetics) will be presented. Conclusions: Deep proteomic profiling of BCP ALL establishes a singlecell classification linking phenotype with functional attributes of leukemic cells. This data demonstrates that heterogeneity within leukemia may be related to developmental state of the leukemic cell. Conflict of interest: None 59 Primary Induction Failure and Early Relapses in Children with AML Sorafenib and sunitinib, putative VEGF receptor inhibitors approved for use in metastatic renal cell carcinoma are relatively good FLT3 inhibitors. Sorafenib in particular has been shown to have both single agent activity 16 and has been combined with both standard induction chemotherapy 17 and hypomethylating agent 18 therapy. A phase III trial of chemotherapy plus or minus sorafenib in newly diagnosed AML patients (not restricted to mutant FLT3) suggests that sorafenib may lead to a superior event free survival with a trend toward improved overall survival. 19 The frequent and appropriate use of stem cell transplant to consolidate first remissions in AML patients with FLT3 mutations may cloud the ability to note an overall survival advantage with any new agent in AML, and FLT3 agents in particular, when used early in the course of the disease. Moreover, FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib have shown impressive responses in patients with FLT3 AML relapsing after a stem cell transplant. 20 Why this setting might yield a high number of responses with FLT3 inhibitors is unclear, but may have to do with changes in the immunologic millieu engendered by these compounds or perhaps by the different disease biology present in the post-transplant relapse setting. In any event, most subsequent trials will likely employ FLT3 inhibitors after transplant alone and/or in addition to early use In summary, the use of FLT3 inhibitors as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy in AML has not yet led to an approved agent. However, the story is far from over. Both sorafenib and midostaurin as adjuncts to standard chemotherapy in FLT3 mutant AML (and sorafenib in all AML), quizartinib as a single agent in AML, and crenolinib with its relatively unusual ability to inhibit both FLT3 ITD and TKD, may each have a role in AML. While FLT3 inhibitors are unlikely to have major long term disease mediating activity as single agents, drugs which can 'bridge' patients to transplant and/or potentiate the effects of chemotherapy may be useful. Thus, while FLT3 inhibitors have not been the straightforward hoped-for panacea in AML, it is much too early to 'close the book.'

In the last years, great interest has been focused on the identification of surface molecules that are preferentially expressed by AML cells and leukemia stem cells (LSCs), in order to selectively target the tumor population, whilst sparing the normal counterpart of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)(Majeti 2011), and possibly impeding disease recurrence. To this aim, the genetic engineering of T cells by the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has changed the therapeutic landscape of immunotherapy approaches, and very promising results have been reached also in the clinical setting(Davila 2014). CARs are artificial T cell-receptors constituted by an extracellular-antigen-binding domain (consisting of the variable chains of a monoclonal antibody linked together as a single chain Fragment variable-scFv-) and an intracellular-signaling region (usually the \u03b6 chain of the TCR/CD3 complex) that is triggered after antigen recognition, leading to T-cell activation, with consequent killing of target cells and cytokine release(Gross et al, 1989). A proper effector population to be redirected by CARs is represented by Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, a heterogeneous population, enriched in CD3+CD56+ compartment, sharing some functional properties with NK cells(Baker 2001). CIK cells can lyse different tumor targets in a non-MHC restricted manner, and display anti-tumor activity in vivo(Nishimura 2008). Additionally, they show negligible allo-reactivity and thus induce minimal graft versus host disease(Introna 2007;Sangiolo 2011). Thus, arming CIK cells with a CAR molecule could represent a suitable strategy to target AML. To address this issue, we compared in vitro and in vivo the efficacy and safety of CIK cells genetically modified to express CAR molecules specific for two AMLoverexpressed antigens, CD33 and CD123.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF14": {"text": "References 1.)

The vast majority of these mutations which affect the twelfth exon of the gene, are frameshift and nonsense mutations and they are generally associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor clinical outcome. The encoded protein is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This study aimed to identify the ASXL1 mutations in de novo and secondary AML patients and associate them with the cytogenetic findings. Methods: Our study included 200 AML patients (148 de novo AML and 52 s-AML) and 10 healthy donors. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on unstimulated bone marrow cells. In order to detect ASXL1 exon 12 mutations molecular analysis was performed by PCR and subsequent direct Sanger sequencing in all patients' and controls' samples. Results: A successful karyotypic analysis was performed in all AML samples at diagnosis. Among them, 128 (64%) exhibited clonal karyotypic abnormalities while 72 (36%) showed a normal karyotype. ASXL1 mutations were detected in 38 out of 200 patients (19%). A significantly higher frequency of ASXL1 mutations was observed in s-AML compared to de novo AML patients (28.8% vs 15.5%, respectively; p=0.035). None ASXL1 mutation was observed in the control group. The most frequent ASXL1 mutation was the c.1934dupG (31/38, 81.5%). ASXL1 mutations were more frequently found in males than in females (20.4% vs 18.8%, respectively), while stratification of patients according to age revealed a higher frequency of ASXL1 mutations in patients \u226560years than patients <60years (p=0.004). Among the 38 AML patients with ASXL1 mutations, 9 patients had trisomy 8 (23.7%), 12 had a normal karyotype (31.5%), 2 had t(8;21)(5.3%), 2 had trisomy 13 (5.3%) and 13 patients other chromosomal abnormalities (34.2%). Conclusions: These results suggest that ASXL1 mutations are frequent in AML, especially in s-AML. ASXL1 mutations are highly correlated with older age, male sex and specific karyotypic aberrations. The most common chromosomal abnormality associated with ASXL1 mutations is trisomy 8. 6 Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, LMU Munich, Germany Introduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) or custom gene panel sequencing (GPS) allows to detect gain or loss of genomic material in tumor cells (i.e. copy number alteration; CNA) and thereby whole chromosome aneuploidies and submicroscopic amplifications or deletions of genomic regions. We performed WES at diagnosis and complete remission of AML patients with partial deletions of chromosome 9 (AML del(9q), n=5) as well as GPS of known mutational targets in AML and candidate genes located on 9q of 26 diagnostic AML del(9q) samples and 21 AML patients without any detectable cytogenetic aberration on chromosome 9. Method: CNA profiling based on WES showed somatically acquired stretches of significantly reduced read counts for genes located on 9q in 2 of the 5 patients, which is in line with corresponding SNP array results. CNA profiling based on GPS defined a common deleted region with a size of at least 8.4 Mb, detected in 18 out of 26 (70%) patients. Patient samples without detected 9q deletion in our CNA analysis have significantly fewer metaphases with 9q deletion (median 27%, range 8-77%) compared to samples tested positive for 9q deletion by our CNA analysis (median 95%, range 24-100%; p=0.001), as reported by routine cytogenetics. Furthermore, the varying clone size harboring the 9q deletion in the diagnostic samples is limiting for CNA detection. Result: Beyond the identification of somatic mutations with single nucleotide resolution, sequencing data enables the efficient detection of recurring and/or somatic CNAs in AML. Purpose: Deregulated DNA repair is one of the hallmarks of cancers including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), as it results in genomic instability. ATM gene functions as a sensor, activates cascade of events leading to stimulation of multiple DNA damage-responsive signaling pathways. Principal DNA repair mechanism activated in the hematopoietic stem cells is the Non Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. However, this pathway was shown to be error prone. Functional SNPs in the genes involved in DNA repair might influence the gene expression leading to altered DNA repair which might confer the risk to AML. Methods: This hospital-based case-control study included 225 AML patients and 326 cancer-free controls from South Indian population. Six polymorphisms of XRCC5, XRCC6, XRCC7 and ATM were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS (version 20.v) and SNPSTAT online tool. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis was also done to see the relationship between these genes. Results: We found that there was an elevated risk of AML associated with the XRCC5 VNTR 0R repeat and A allele of 2408G>A polymorphism (p-0.04 and p<0.0001 respectively). The frequencies of G allele (p-<0.0001) of XRCC6 -1310C>G and T allele (p-0.003) of ATM -5144A>T polymorphisms were also significantly increased in AML cases. Further, analyses of the variant genotypes with epidemiological and clinical variables revealed a significant association of the risk genotypes with development and progression of AML. However, XRCC6 -61C>G and XRCC7 6721G>>T polymorphisms did not show any association with AML Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a high-risk disease for developing secondary neoplasms due to immunodeficiency associated with the disease and/or with the treatment. Acute myeloid leukemia(AML)or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was a rarely entity, these were observed in 3.5% to 6.1% of patients treated with fludarabine alone or in combination. AML or MDS coexisting with untreated CLL were also reported. Case report: We report here a case of 60-year female with the diagnosis of CLL Rai stage 1 with no chromosomal changes, who developed AML preceded by t-MDS, 3 years after completion of CLL therapy consisted with 6 courses with FC-R regimen. She achieved CR with incomplete recovery of platelet and WBC count. In August 2009 she was admitted to hospital with symptoms of pleuro-pneumonia and deep pancytopenia with 5% of blasts in peripheral blood (PB)and 15% in bone marrow aspirate-RAEB was diagnosed. A week later performed BM revealed 42% of blasts which displayed a myelomonocytic phenotype.Cytogenetic analysis showed complex chromosomal abnormalities; del 5 (13q33), trisomy 8, trisomy 20, monosomy 21. No abnormalities concerning chromosomes; 11, 12, 13 and 17 were seen. The diagnosis of AML/RAEB-t was made. No CLL cell clone was found in BM, no organomegaly was seen in CT examination. The patient was still in CR of CLL. The patient received induction chemotherapy with daunorubicine plus cytarabine(3+5)and obtained CR. Relapse occurred three months later. The patient died 8 months later due to leukemia with its complications (infections, haemorrhages from GI tract). Conclusions: In presented case we can consider drug-related origin of AML in patient with complete remission of CLL or another myeloid neoplasm from unknown origin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1030, "end": 1031, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3317, "end": 3318, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest: The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest"}, {"text": "Purpose: Genetic barcodes (BCs) are short sequences that are introduced into the genome as an expression-independent method for stable and unique marking of cells and their progeny. We used a BcrAbl-BCtransduced cell line to investigate clonal competition in vitro as well as in the development and progression of BcrAbl-induced leukaemia in the mouse model. Methods: We constructed a \u03b3-retroviral vector encoding BcrAbl in conjunction with GFP. In this vector, our BC32-sequence was introduced to establish a \u03b3-GFP-BC32-BcrAbl-vector plasmid library. \u03b3-retroviral vectors were generated and used to transduce the murine, IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3. After IL-3 withdrawal, cells were cultured for 52 days; samples were taken every 2-3 days to follow the clonal dynamics in vitro. Background: The success of anti-leukemia treatment depends on the response of leukemia cells towards drug treatment; treatment resistance leads to persistence of tumor cells, post-therapeutic residual disease and potentially disease relapse. Patients and methods: Here, we studied the influence of the feeder cells on drug sensitivity of patient-derived ALL cells in vitro. Towards this aim, primary ALL cells from two children with high-risk or relapsed BCP-ALL were amplified in immunocompromised mice and cells freshly isolated from mice were subjected to in vitro experiments. Several cytotoxic drugs of routine ALL treatment were used to stimulate patient-derived ALL cells in vitro. Stimulations were performed in the presence Introduction: The T315I gatekeeper mutation confers resistance to majority of approved ABL1 inhibitors, with only ponatinib demonstrating efficacy in BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven disease. However, vascular adverse events and selection of resistant compound mutations limit its clinical utility. Hence, there is an unmet need for novel treatment strategies for patients with gatekeeper-mutated Ph+ leukemia. Method: In this study we integrated comprehensive drug sensitivity testing with structural analysis to characterize the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a potential novel therapy for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemias. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing of primary cells derived from a Ph+ ALL patient revealed a cancer-selective response to the VEGF inhibitor axitinib (currently approved for renal cell carcinoma). Strikingly, axitinib exhibited higher sensitivity in T315I positive Ph+ patient samples in comparison to T315I negative patient samples. In accordance, axitinib inhibited the kinase activity of ABL1(T315I) with similar potency as its intended primary target VEGFR2, while showing >30-fold lower potency towards non-mutated ABL1. Analogously, in engineered Ba/F3 cells, axitinib showed a 10-fold higher potency to inhibit T315I than nonmutated ABL1-driven autophosphorylation and cell growth. The axitinib:ABL1(T315I) crystal structure revealed that axitinib bound to a T315I-mutant induced active conformation of ABL1(T315I), different than the binding mode in non-mutated ABL1, likely explaining the increased potency towards the gatekeeper mutated protein.Result: Compassionate two week treatment of a CML patient harboring the T315I mutation with axitinib, resulted in a rapid 5-fold reduction of T315I transcript levels in the bone marrow, further suggesting that axitinib can produce specific and effective responses in patients with BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia. Conclusion: We demonstrate that axitinib potently inhibits BCR-ABL1(T315I) via a gatekeeper mutant-selective mechanism. Since axitinib is in clinical use for treatment of refractory renal cell carcinoma with a manageable safety profile, our data provide a sound basis for readily repurposing axitinib for BCR-ABL1(T315I)-driven leukemia. Finally, the distinct mechanism of inhibition by axitinib serves as an exemplar for development of even more effective gatekeeper-mutant selective inhibitors targeting ABL1 as well as other clinically important kinases, such as EGFR, FLT3 and KIT. ). NALM6 cALL line was retrovirally transduced with MLXIP short hairpin RNA, which reduced the MLXIP expression by 80%. Upon MLXIP knock down (kd), kd and control lines were injected iv; CD10+ blasts in blood, spleen and bone marrow were assessed after 30 days. Importantly, in vivo MLXIP maintained 90-99% of CD10+ leukemic blasts. Spleen size and weight became normal by MLXIP kd: Results: While signs of leukemia engraftment were observed in all mice, the differences of CD10+ blasts in blood, bone marrow and spleens in the control vs. the MLXIP kd group were highly significant (p=0.008). The decrease of leukemic splenomegaly after MLXIP kd was most impressive: Median spleen weight was 0.22g vs. 0.08g in the control vs. the kd group. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that MLXIP maintains leukemic burden and malignancy of cALL in vivo. Introduction: Personalized molecular medicine is gaining traction as more doctors are insisting on reliable biomarker testing to diagnose and stratify their patients for treatment or enrolment in clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies seek to shorten drug development by being more selective (recruiting \"the right patient for the right drug\") before trial enrolment. Wider recruitment to access sufficient patient populations to power development of new therapeutic agents requires more laboratories with harmonized testing for reliable stratification and selection for trials. Standardized and harmonized international clinical testing is now required. Analytical metrics were used to harmonize and validate a next generation sequencing (NGS) assay manufactured under ISO 13485 for clinical use in our US and EU clinical labs. Methods: All reagents were manufactured under cGMP and QC tested under a QSR compliant regulatory system for use in validation studies. Site to site validation tested Limit of Detection (LOD), Blank (LOB), Linearity, Precision and Reproducibility (Repro) to pre-specified standards. The LymphoTrack\u00ae IGH PGM assay was used for this validation. LOD and LOB validation consisted of 1 operator using 1 instrument to run a dilution series of a cell line DNAs in tonsil DNAs in each lab. Samples were run in duplicate with 1 lot of master mix and a 1 lot of tonsil DNA control. The Repro study included 2 runs by each of 2 operators in each lab (8 runs total). JMP software assessed the LOD, LOB and Repro runs of the assay based on 96 data points. Results: Concordance between the labs was excellent with %CVs <20% and both labs showing inter and intra repeatability and reproducibility between labs, demonstrating harmonization among labs that use cGMP reagents and assays. (see table) . Furthermore, patients with trisomy 8 exclusively had a poor outcome. Interestingly, monosomies (excluding -7) were detected in 19 patients, out of whom 12 belonged to the genetically high risk group due to other aberrations. However, the remaining 7 patients showed a dismal outcome, too. Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become a cornerstone in the treatment of patients at high risk for relapse of their acute leukemia. Initially monitoring of chimerism after HSCT was applied to confirm donor cell engraftment, but, since relapse is host derived, the increase of host chimerism might indicate imminent relapse. However, commonly used STR assays are limited by low sensitivity, whereas XY-FISH, CD34+ cell chimerism and MRD approaches are limited by applicability. Study aim: In this prospective, non-interventional study we evaluated the accuracy, reliability and feasibility of a quantitative PCR based commercially available assay (Allele SEQR\u00ae Chimerism Assay, Abbott) and its potential for early relapse detection. Between 05/11 and 01/13 95 consecutive patients that received allo-HSCT for AML/MDS, were enrolled. Method and results: According to local standards, bone marrow samples were tested at day 30, 90 and 180 after allo-HSCT and patients were followed up until 03/14. Informative markers were available in all screened patients (n=68). High sensitivity (<0,05% at 100ng DNA) translated in a remarkable relapse prediction/ exclusion rate in 61 repetitively tested patients (relapse rate 86% vs. 15%, p=<0,001, Mantel-Byar) with a median time from positive testing to relapse of 68 days resp. no relapse within >60days after negative testing. Conclusion: Hence, this approach might facilitate personalized monitoring and chimerism-triggered therapy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 6650, "end": 6661, "text": "(see table)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Conflict of interest: None"}, {"text": "Late Submissions Abstract Lung infiltrates are frequent in patients treated for acute leukemia and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The development of pulmonary infiltrates is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in these severely immunocompromised patients. The differential diagnosis of lung infiltrates is wide and should include infectious and non-infectious causes. Pneumonia remains a major cause of mortality among leukemia and HSCT patients, espeially when complicated with bacteremia. Among non-infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema are particularly common. This short review specifically focuses on the current epidemiology of lung infiltrates in patients with acute leukemia and HSCT recipients. The development of lung infiltrates in patients treated for acute leukemia and in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a frequent life threatening complication, requiring early diagnosis and treatment. [1] [2] [3] [4] In particular, it has been estimated that patients with high-risk neutropenia, develop pulmonary infiltrates with a likelihood of 20-25%. 1, 5, 6 Pulmonary infiltrates in leukemia and HSCT patients pose a major challenge for clinicians because of the wide differential diagnosis, including infectious and non-infectious causes. 7, 8 In a recent study, noninvasive and bronchoscopic diagnostic techniques were applied to determine the etiology of the pulmonary infiltrates in 200 consecutive patients with different non-HIV conditions, of whom 121 (60%) had hematologic malignancies or were HSCT recipients. 3 The etiology of lung infiltrates was infectious in 23% of cases, non-infectious in 23%, and in 19% remained undetermined. The main infectious etiologies were bacterial (24%), fungal (17%), and viral (10%). The most frequent pathogens were Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the noninfectious etiologies, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia were the most common causes. 3 Other non-infectious causes that should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates include lung involvement by the underlying malignancy, immune reconstitution syndrome and lesions caused by chemotherapy or radiation. Importantly, pneumonia is a common cause of mortality among leukemia and HSCT patients. In a retrospective study of 801 patients with acute leukemia who underwent induction chemotherapy, pneumonia occurred in 233 (29%) of them. 5 One or more pathogens were identified in 79 (34%) cases; gram-positive bacteria were present in 67% of patients, gram-negatives in 30%, fungi in 23%, and viruses in 10%. In a multivariate analysis, age greater than or equal to 60 years, acute myeloid leukemia, low platelet count, low albumin level, neutropenia, and neutrophil count greater than 7,300 were risk factors. The case fatality rate of pneumonia was 17% (40 of 233 patients). 5 In a retrospective study of 458 patients affected by acute leukemia receiving an anthracycline-containing induction regimen, 109 (23.8%) developed pneumonia. 6 Advanced age and total blast count were the only factors independently associated with a higher risk of developing pneumonia. The case fatality rate of pneumonia was 38.5% (42 of 109 patients). 6 Attributable mortality of pneumonia was 55% and overall mortality reached 62.5% in a prospective series of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer. 9 In that study, P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia. According to data from the Hospital Infection Surveillance System for Patients with Hmatologic/Oncologic Malignancies (ONKO-KISS), initiated in Germany in 2000, the pooled mean site-specific incidence density per 1000 neutropenic days was 5.9 for pneumonia (6.1 and 5.6 in patients with allogeneic and autologous transplantation, respectively The development of pneumonia and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was associated was associated with increased mortality after allogeneic HSCT, and the probability of survival was significantly lower in patients that had at least one pneumonia episode. Pneumonia development in the first 100 days after transplantation, fungal etiology, GVHD, acute respiratory failure, and septic shock were associated with increased mortality after pneumonia. 11 The incidence, etiology, outcome, and risk factors for developing pneumonia late after HSCT were investigated in 1359 patients who underwent transplantation in Seattle. 12 A total of 341 patients (25%) developed one or more episodes of pneumonia. Etiological diagnoses was established in 144 patients, including virus (10%), bacteria (9%), P. jirovecii (5%), and other fungi (6%). The overall cumulative incidence of first pneumonia at 4 years after discharge home was 31%. Factors independently associated with development of late pneumonia after allografting were increasing patient age (RR 0.5 for <20 years, 1.2 for >40 years, P=0.009), donor HLA-mismatch (RR 1.6 for unrelated/mismatched related, P=0.01), and chronic GVHD (RR 1.5, P=0.007). 12 Finally, it should be pointed out, that respiratory viruses such as Influenza, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, Human Metapneumovirus or Respiratory Syncytial Virus are an important yet underestimated cause of respiratory tract infection and lung infiltrates in immunocompromised patients, particularly among allogeneic HSCT recipients. [13] [14] [15] [16] In individual patients, respiratory viruses such as Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 may also facilitate the development of invasive aspergillosis. 17 In immunosuppressed patients affected by these viruses, neutropenia, poor APACHE II score, age over 65 years and severe lymphocytopenia have been reported prognostic factors resulting in a higher risk of fatal outcome. In summary, the development of lung infiltrates occur frequently in leukemia and HSCT patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates is wide and includes infectious and non-infectious complications. In particular, pneumonia remains one of the most significant causes of mortality among these severely immunocompromised patients. Two decades ago when AML blasts were found to harbor FLT3 mutations in approximately 35% of patients 1 there was hope that this gain-of function mutation in a tyrosine kinase inhibitor might be an important therapeutic target in this relatively resistant disease. Moreover, recognition that the most common type of mutation, namely a length or internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane region of the FLT3 receptor, was associated with relatively poor prognosis 2 further spurred therapeutic development. A number of FLT3 inhibitors were shown to have important in vitro activity in murine models. Such agents inhibit the growth of leukemic cell lines whose growth factor independence was based on a FLT3 ITD transduced gene 3 or improve outcomes of a fatal myeloproliferative disorder from a FLT3 ITD stem cell transplant. 4 However, the lack of an approved FLT3 inhibitor in 2015 suggests that this potential therapeutic avenue was paved with rocks and stones rather than gold. However, there is still significant hope that one or more FLT3inhibitors might yet find their way into the therapeutic armamentarium of AML drugs either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Some of the pitfalls in the therapeutic development of FLT3 inhibitors in AML have been inconsistent potency, protein binding leading to the lack of sufficient drug levels for prolonged enzyme inhibition, off-target effects, non-specificity, high FLT3 ligand levels, and probably most importantly the issue that a FLT3 mutation is a relatively late 'hit' in the pathophysiology of AML. The FLT3 inhibitors which have undergone clinical development in AML to greater or lesser degrees to fall into three categories: 1) \"early\" agents (tandutinib, lestaurtinib, and midostaurin), \"later\" agents (quizartinib, PLX3397, and crenolinib) and 3) sorafenib. Tandutinib emerged out of solid pre-clinical testing, had activity in early phase trials 5 , but a business decision led to its abandonment as a therapeutic agent. Lestaurtinib displayed single agent activity in a 14 patient trial conducted at Johns Hopkins. 6 However, a randomized trial in which chemotherapy (the choice of which dependent on the disease free interval) plus or minus lestaurtinib was given to patients with relapsed FLT3 ITD mutant AML showed no benefit for the addition of lestaurtinib to chemotherapy. 7 Ancillary studies revealed that the failure of this trial may have been due in part to the fact that insufficient lestaurtinib levels in plasma were present in many patients. Those who achieved adequate lestaurtinib levels for long enough period of time did experience a benefit. Nonetheless, because of the negative results lestaurtinib will likely not be developed further in AML. The third agent which has been in development for over 10 years, midostaurin, is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that inhibits both tyrosine kinases and serine-theonine kinases. Single agent trials with this drug at various doses showed that it had the ability to reduce the blast counts in many patients with FTL3 mutant AML (and in a few patients with FLT3 wild-type AML) 8 but important clinical responses were rare. Nonetheless, the biological activity of this drug was encouraging enough so that it was combined with chemotherapy in a phase IB trial. While higher doses of midostaurin were not well tolerated in combination with standard induction chemotherapy, a tolerable dose of 50 miligrams twice daily in combination with chemotherapy was retrospectively shown to improve the disease free and overall survival of FLT3 ITD patients to a range seen in FLT3 wild type patients. 9 These relatively encouraging results prompted a large phase III trial (CALGB 10603; RATIFTY) in patients aged 18-60 with FLT3 mutant AML in which standard induction chemotherapy and high dose ara-C consolidation was combined with either placebo or midostaurin for 14 days per cycle followed by continuous maintenance placebo or midostaurin for a year. Midostaurin, unlike most of the other FLT3 inhibitors (except for crenolinib to be described below) can inhibit both the FLT3 ITD and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutants, allowing accrual of patients with both FLT3 mutant subtypes (n=714 over 4 years). The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival (not censored for stem cell transplant) to be analyzed after 504 deaths; however, perhaps because of a high rate of stem cell transplantation (55% overall, 24% in CR1), these events have not yet occurred. Event-free survival data will hopefully soon be available; discussions with regulatory agencies are ongoing to allow release of this data. Thus, it is possible that midostaurin might be approved as a drug to be combined with chemotherapy for mutant FLT3 AML. One of the newer agents, PLX3397 10 , has undergone phase I/II testing in patients with mutant FLT3 AML. This drug is more specific and perhaps better tolerated than the first generation agents. Initial results are encouraging; it is unclear if and when this drug will be developed further in AML. Probably the most promising agent for potential use as a single agent in AML is quizartinib which has the advantage of a high degree of potency and specificity for the FLT3 ITD mutation. In phase I/II trials the drug showed an impressive level of activity in terms of reducing the blast count in blood and marrow, 11, 12 although true complete remissions were noted in less than 10% of treated patients. Interestingly for this specific drug, there were also some responses in FLT3 wild-type patients; however, the overall response rate of 60% in FLT3 mutant patients is impressive. One of the potential drawbacks of this agent is that it selects for secondary tyrosine kinase domain mutations, providing mechanism for early resistance. 13 These results have led to registration ongoing trial of this drug vs physicians'-choice chemotherapy for patients with relapsed mutant FLT3 AML. The drug has also been tolerably combined with chemotherapy 14 ; the U.S. Intergroup has plans to perform a randomized trial of chemotherapy plus or minus quizartinib during induction, post-remission therapy and specifically after stem cell transplant.Crenolinib have the potential advantage of inhibiting both FLT3 ITD and FLT3 TKD mutations. 15 Phase I evaluation of this agent has suggested that there is a significant level of activity. Potentially this drug will also be combined with chemotherapy in preparation for a phase III chemo plus or minus crenolinib trial.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1022, "end": 1025, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1029, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1178, "text": "1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1181, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1183, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1368, "text": "7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1370, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1645, "end": 1646, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2121, "end": 2122, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2606, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3045, "end": 3046, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3205, "end": 3206, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3401, "end": 3402, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3598, "end": 3599, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4508, "end": 4510, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4680, "end": 4682, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5258, "end": 5260, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5605, "end": 5609, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5610, "end": 5614, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5615, "end": 5619, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5620, "end": 5624, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5764, "end": 5766, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7219, "end": 7220, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8492, "end": 8493, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8756, "end": 8757, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10028, "end": 10029, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 11766, "end": 11769, "text": "11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 11770, "end": 11772, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 12188, "end": 12190, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 12680, "end": 12682, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflict of interest: None"}]}
