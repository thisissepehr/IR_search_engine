The yield of carboxy-protected conjugates of glycyrrhizinic acid containing three amino acid residues was 82-94%. Although N,N'dicyclohexylurea formed in the reaction course is very poorly soluble in organic solvents, sometimes it could not be completely removed from the reaction mixture that led to contamination of the target product. Watersoluble carbodiimides like 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide were found to be more suitable as condensing reagents. It did not provide dicyclohexylurea, and its product of water addition remained in the aqueous phase at the workup of the reaction mixture with water. Earlier 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3ethylcarbodiimide was not applied to the synthesis of amino acid conjugates of glycyrrhizinic acid. The yield of carboxy-protected conjugates 3-7 reached 85-90% (Scheme 1). The structure of the obtained compounds was confirmed by IR and 13 C NMR spectra as well as by comparison of R f and [\u03b1] D 20 values with those of known compounds [16, 17] .",
