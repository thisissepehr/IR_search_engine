Second, standard tissue fixatives and processing alters the lipid-rich cell wall of acid-fast organisms which reduces the detection sensitivity in FFPE samples. Last, AFS does not allow for discrimination between various acid-fast organisms, such as mycobacteria tuberculosis (MTB) vs. non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). To address these issues with AFS, we have developed a highly sensitive and specific RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) assay using the RNAscope technology for the detection of mycobacteria rRNA in FFPE tissues and distinction of MTB and NTM.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Design:"}, {"text": "Design: FFPE serial sections from 50 clinically diagnosed TB patients were collected from five hospitals in China.

Among male cases, 3.5% were identified as men who have sex with men (MSM), compared to reported 14-84% in other outbreaks. A public health emergency was declared and an education/vaccination campaign with distribution of hygiene kits, deployment of bathrooms and hand washing stations was conducted. The outbreak ended on 1/23/2018 and now provides an opportunity to re-familiarize pathologists with epidemiologic and histologic findings of HAV. These were more commonly seen in biliary dyskinesia (BD) patients compared to calculus cholecystitis. However, very recently Swanson et al performed molecular analysis targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) in the C. belli ribosomal gene in similar specimens. No amplification was found in the GB specimens as opposed to the positive Cytoisospora infected intestinal specimens from immunocompromised individuals.

In some of the inclusions, the central part is denser giving the appearance of a nucleus of a microgametocyte. The epithelial cell nuclei were preserved and no degenerated nuclear material was seen in the inclusions. None of these cases showed amplified products on molecular analysis. Conclusions: EM and molecular analysis reveals that these intraepithelial structures are inclusions formed by condensation of the cytoplasm and not of protozoan origin. Reduced ejection fraction in BD patients may lead to prolonged exposure of GB mucosa to bile (cytolytic) and more frequent development of these inclusions. However, prospective studies evaluating the role of preanalytic variables (time to formalin exposure of the gallbladder mucosa, different technical parameters involved in specimen processing etc.) in the development of these inclusions are needed. Awareness of these rare findings is necessary to avoid over-diagnosis of Cystoisospora infection.

The cystitis group had a median age of 77 and a male to female ratio of 6:4. The most common presenting symptom was burning on urination in 37% of patients. There was 90.1% positive percentage agreement between the PCR and culture results, which significantly exceeded the non-inferiority threshold of 85% with p=0.03. 22% of cases had significant levels of organisms that were detected by PCR that were missed on traditional culture, and these results were confirmed by NGS in a large number of cases. 75 cases of NGS have been completed and show excellent confirmation of the PCR results: 3/3=100% of culture positive, PCR negative samples were shown to be negative with NGS; 10/12=83% of culture negative, PCR positive samples were shown to be positive with NGS.Conclusions: PCR based UTI analysis can detect significantly more organisms than traditional culture, and is significantly non-inferior in detecting the same organisms as traditional culture. Prospective randomized trials are currently underway that will be required to demonstrate a benefit to detecting and treating these additional organisms in patients. Background: The diagnosis of blastomycosis is challenging. The diagnosis may be confirmed by histologic examination, microbiology cultures or urine antigen detection. Misdiagnosis is relatively common and appears multifactorial. In this study we attempt to uncover common risk factors. We also aim to investigate diagnostic challenges including the most sensitive method of detection in order to avoid treatment delays and possible misdiagnosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Design: A retrospective study was performed evaluating all cases of blastomycosis diagnosed at the University of Vermont Medical Center over ten years (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) . Data concerning surgical pathology, cytopathology, autopsy, bone marrow and culture reports were obtained for all positive blastomycosis cases. Age and county matched control groups, representing 3x the number of positive specimens, were obtained for comparison. 115 positive specimens, representing 57 patients with the average age of 51 years old, were identified.Results: Our demographic data shows that the there is a higher incidence in males versus females (60% vs 40% respectively). While 83% of patients with blastomycosis had a BMI over 28, just 26% of the control group had this BMI range. The highest concentration of cases is around the Lake Champlain area. All 115 specimens were reviewed to determine the concordance of pathology and culture results. In our positive anatomic pathology cases, 25% had a negative culture report (5% of anatomic pathology specimens were not cultured). Alternatively, 27% of cases with positive cultures, showed no Blastomyces in anatomic pathology specimens (13% of these cases did not have any anatomic pathology specimen).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 157, "text": "(2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 158, "end": 164, "text": "(2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 165, "end": 171, "text": "(2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 172, "end": 178, "text": "(2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 179, "end": 185, "text": "(2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 186, "end": 192, "text": "(2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 193, "end": 199, "text": "(2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 200, "end": 206, "text": "(2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 207, "end": 213, "text": "(2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 214, "end": 220, "text": "(2016)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 221, "end": 227, "text": "(2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "What is the best diagnostic modality for Blastomycosis Dermatitis in the endemic areas?
