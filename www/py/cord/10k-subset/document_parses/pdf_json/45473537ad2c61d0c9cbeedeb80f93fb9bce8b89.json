[2] Manners, for example, has reported that dehydrocoupling of MeNH 2 \u00b7BH 3 to oligomeric or polymeric compounds may be effected by both homo-and heterogeneous Group 9 species. [3] Exemplified by this work, most progress has been based around the study of mid or late transition metals and relatively little attention has been directed toward d 0 species of the early transition metals (Groups 3-5) or metals of Groups 1 and 2. [4] [5] [6] In contrast to the reactivity derived from low oxidation state or more electron-rich catalytic centers, these series of metals must necessarily preclude the possibility of B \u00c0 H oxidative addition (via B \u00c0 H s-borane complexes) [7] and/or B\u00c0N reductive elimination as pathways toward amidoborane formation. [1c] Keller demonstrated in the 1970s that more complex amidoboranes could be prepared by a combination of R 2 N\u00c0 for H exchange and H 2 elimination from the interaction of either lithium primary amides and B 2 H 6 or alkali metal hydrides and amine-boranes. [8] A recent report by Sneddon and co-workers has highlighted the ability of the strong, non-nucleophilic base bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene and the Group 1 derivatives lithium and potassium triethylborohydride to effect H 3 N\u00b7BH 3 dehydrogenation by initial nitrogen deprotonation to form [H 3 BNH 2 ] \u00c0 and subsequent anionic dehydropolym-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G erA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G ization. [9] Although hydrogen release may be promoted by solid-state ball milling with MgH 2 , and conversion of H 3 N\u00b7BH 3 to the crystallographically characterized calcium amidotrihydoborates [CaA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (NH 2 BH 3 ) 2 A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (thf) n ] (n = 0, 1, 2) has been reported to result in significantly reduced hydrogen release temperatures, these solid-state reactions are, necessarily, mechanistically uncertain. [10, 11] Two years ago we reported that s-bond metathesis reactions of b-diketiminato calcium amides with the secondary organoborane 9-BBN (9-borobicycloA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G [3.3.1]nonane) result in the formation of B \u00c0 N bonded species and a calcium hydride as the reaction products. [12] More recently, Harder has reported that sequential H 2 elimination can be induced from b-diketiminato calcium with four or two equivalents of Me 2 NHBH 3 , respectively, produce compounds containing the [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ion, which coordinates to the magnesium centers through Mg \u00c0 N and Mg\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7HB interactions in both the solution and solid states. Thermolysis of these com-pounds at 60 8C produces the cyclic product [(H 2 BNMe 2 ) 2 ] and, it is proposed, magnesium hydrido species by an unprecedented d-hydride elimination process. Calcium-based species, although less reactive than their magnesium-based counterparts, are found to engage in similar dehydrocoupling reactivity and to produce a similar distribution of products under thermally promoted catalytic conditions. A mechanism for these observations is presented that involves initial production and insertion of H 2 B=NMe 2 into polarized M \u00c0 N bonds as the major B \u00c0 N bondforming step. The efficacy of this insertion and subsequent b-or d-hydride elimination steps is proposed to be dependent upon the charge density and polarizing capability of the participating Group 2 center, providing a rationale for the observed differences in reactivity between magnesium and calcium. amidoborane derivatives of both H 3 N\u00b7BH 3 itself and BH 3 adducts of primary amines and anilines. [13] In these cases further thermally induced B \u00c0 N formation apparently occurred via the intermediacy of dimeric calcium complexes of the complex dianions [RN-BH-NR-BH 3 ] 2\u00c0 (R = H; Me; iPr). In cases in which dimerization was not possible, unimolecular H 2 elimination provided species containing coordinated imidoborane anions. Most recently, the same group reported that di-n-butyl magnesium or a b-diketiminate-supported magnesium silylamide are capable of the catalytic dehydrocoupling of the primary anilino-borane, (Dipp)NH 2 BH 3 (Dipp = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl), via the intermediacy of a structurally characterized magnesium anilido species,", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 245, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 419, "end": 422, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 670, "end": 673, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 674, "end": 677, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 678, "end": 681, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 910, "end": 913, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[1c]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1251, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1663, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1893, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2109, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2113, "text": "11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2403, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3752, "end": 3756, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "in the case of the heteroleptic derivative.

Although sound precedent has been provided for the intermediacy of a resultant magnesium hydride by the same authors isolation of a tetrahydridoborane magnesium species from this reaction and their synthesis of the zinc hydride II via an analogous zinc primary amidoborane derivative, [6a, b] no rationale was developed for the mechanism of B \u00c0 N bond formation and concurrent H 2 elimination to provide the complex intermediate [(Dipp)NHBH 2 NH-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (Dipp)BH 3 ] \u00c0 ion during the dehydrocoupling reaction (Scheme 1). Rather, these authors suggested that this central step simply occurs by a mechanistically undefined reaction of the isolated magnesium amidoborane with the acidic ammonia-borane (Dipp)NH 2 BH 3 . [6a] Following the example of Manners and coworkers, [5] we have initiated a program of study of the reactions of Group 2 metal alkyls and amides with secondary amine-boranes, R 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 , in the expectation that extra substitution of the amine will provide more mechanistically amenable in-termediates.

The corresponding proton-coupled 11 B NMR spectra revealed the complete disappearance of a resonance attributable to the Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 starting material (d 11B 11.9 ppm, 1 J HB = 97.3 Hz) and evidence of two new boron environments observed at 4.0 and \u00c015.3 ppm, which appeared as triplet ( 1 J HB = 102 Hz) and quartet ( 1 J HB = 89 Hz) signals, respectively. The origin of these observations was revealed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis performed upon crystals of compound 1 isolated from hexane. Details of this X-ray analysis are given in Table 1 and selected bond length and angle data are provided in the caption to Figure 1 . As shown in Figure 1 , compound 1 is a discrete magnesium complex in which the magnesium coordination sphere is composed of a molecule of THF and two borylamido anions, [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 . These latter ligands may be considered as the deprotonated form of H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 NH (III), [15] the product of a single dehydrocoupling reaction between two Me 2 NHBH 3 molecules. Although III has previously been postulated as a key intermediate in the catalytic dehydrocoupling of Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 and the dianionic species [H 3 BNHBHNH] 2\u00c0 has been identified from the calcium-induced dehydrocouping of ammonia-borane itself, [3a, 4e,h,i, 12a] to the best of our knowledge, the ligand within compound 1 is the first example of this particular anion to be crystallographically characterized. The primary interactions between the [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ions and magnesium are provided by the formally deprotonated nitrogen atom of each ligand. The observed bond lengths (Mg1 \u00c0 N1 2.1649(11), Mg1 \u00c0 N3 2.1684 (11) ) are considerably longer than those observed between magnesium and the anilidoborane anion within I (Mg\u00c0N 2.083(4) ), but are only slightly elongated in comparison to those within Mg(Me 2 C 5 H 3 BNMe 2 ) 2 (Mg\u00c0N 2.140(3), 2.142(3) ), in which the three-coordinate boron center forms part of a delocalized boratabenzene fragment. [14] Coordination to magnesium evidently produces only minor perturbations to the boron-nitrogen bond lengths of the chelated anion in comparison to the crystallo-Scheme 1. (17), III 1.599(2); B1 \u00c0 N2: 1 1.6145 (17), III 1.589(2); B2 \u00c0 N2: 1 1.5762 (17), III 1.600 (2) ). [15] Although the B \u00c0 N bond lengths across the -NHBHNH-unit of the bridging and calcium-coordinated dianionic species, [H 3 BNHBHNH] 2\u00c0 , (CaNH \u00c0 BH: 1.419(5); NH \u00c0 BH(NH): 1.451(6) ) were greatly shortened in comparison to the relevant B\u00c0N bond lengths within the structure of 1, the bond lengths to the \"terminal\" \u00c0BH 3 component of both anions are significantly shortened within 1 (B2 \u00c0 N2: 1.5762 (17) and B3 \u00c0 N3: 1.5646(17) versus 1.593(6) ). [13] These variations are likely to be a result of both the widely differing charge distribution across the two NBNB moieties, as well as the reduced number of metal-to-ligand contacts within the strictly mononuclear species 1. Monitoring of the B \u00c0 H region of the 1 H- 11 B} NMR spectrum between 228 K and 288 K provided evidence for two independent fluxional processes in [D 8 ]toluene. At temperatures below 258 K, the resonances associated with the BH 2 unit of the ligand backbone occupy diastereotopic environments, most likely owing to the maintenance of a conformation of the chelated ligand similar to that observed in the solid state ( Figure 2 ). The coalescence of these resonances is possibly indicative of either rapid coordination/de-coordination of the THF co-ligand or a facile conformational interconversion process (DG\u00b0= 44.1 kJ mol \u00c01 ) at temperatures above 258 K. The resonances associated with the BH 3 units of compound 1 also displayed a rather more complex decoalescence event at low temperature (< 248 K), suggestive of a low-energy conformational change, possibly involving the rapid coordination and decoordination of terminal and Mg-bound hydrides. Although a value for T c could not be accurately determined for this latter event, both processes indicate that the coordination of the NBNB \u00c0 H chelate to magnesium is, to some extent, retained in toluene. The occurrence of these processes was rather more clearly defined through monitoring of the N\u00c0 Me region of the same series of variable temperature spectra ( Figure 2 ). Again two fluxional events were apparent at temperatures below 258 K and provided free energies of activation for both processes (for d H = 2.33 ppm, DG\u00b0= 42.4 kJ mol \u00c01 ; for d H = 2.23 ppm, DG\u00b0= 46.6 kJ mol \u00c01 ) effectively identical to that deduced for the boron-centered unit within the limits the of experimental observations. Heating a solution of compound 1 in C 6 D 6 to 60 8C, monitored by 11 B NMR spectroscopy over the course of four days, resulted in the disappearance of the signals attributed to the [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ligand and the appearance of a new triplet signal centered at d 11B = 5.2 ppm ( 1 J HB = 108 Hz). This species was identified as the cyclic dimer 1)]. In support of this hypothesis, no evidence for the formation of the BH 4 \u00c0 ion, a necessary consequence of the previously described b-hydride-and BH 3 -elimination based chemistry reported for primary anilidoborane dehydrocoupling was observed. [6] In an attempt to extend the generality of this chemistry and to provide a positive means of identification of the proposed magnesium hydride produced by this process we sought to synthesize a potentially more tractable magnesium species containing the [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ion. (2), which displayed a similar but broadened 11 B NMR (d = 4.1, \u00c014.9 ppm) spectrum to those recorded for compound 1. The identity of compound 2 was confirmed by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment, the results of which are illustrated in Figure 3 . Details of the analysis are given in Table 1 , while selected bond length and angle data are provided in the figure caption. Compound 2 contains a pseudo-four-coordinate magnesium center, in which the coordination sphere of the alkaline earth element is pro-vided by the bidentate b-diketiminate ligand and a chelated [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ion identical to that observed in the homoleptic species, compound 1. The amidoborane ligand binds to the magnesium in an exactly analogous manner in both compounds 1 and 2. The presence of the sterically demanding b-diketiminate ligand and the reduced formal coordination number of the magnesium center in compound 2 produce only minor adjustments to the bond lengths and angles around the six-membered MgNBNBH heterocycle. Although compound 2 proved to be more thermally robust, NMR monitoring of a sample heated to 60 8C for 16 h also resulted in the production (ca. 20 % conversion) of [(H 2 BNMe 2 ) 2 ]. Of more significance, however, was the concurrent production of a small quantity of Jones recently re- [16] identified by comparison to the 1 H NMR literature data and again indicative of a reaction pathway analogous to the b-hydride elimination illustrated in Scheme 1, but involving the d-located BH 3 unit within the chelated anion of 2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 115, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1542, "text": "[3a, 4e,h,i, 12a]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2249, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2521, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2919, "end": 2923, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2967, "end": 2971, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3238, "end": 3240, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3346, "text": "[D 8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4923, "end": 4925, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5461, "end": 5464, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7138, "end": 7142, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 806, "end": 813, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 885, "end": 893, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 908, "end": 916, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3614, "end": 3622, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4512, "end": 4520, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 6069, "end": 6077, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 6117, "end": 6124, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "Irrespective of the mode of formation of the intermediate [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ion (see below), the apparent production of a hydrido species indicated that the dehydrocoupling of Me 2 NHBH 3 at a Group 2 center may be extended to a viable catalytic regime by the consecutive protonolysis/ s-bond metathesis mechanism illustrated in Scheme 2.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "To test this hypothesis, the catalytic dehydrocoupling reaction of Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 utilizing 5 mol % [Mg{CHA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (SiMe 3 ) 2 } 2 -A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (thf) 2 ] as catalyst in C 6 D 6 was attempted at 60 8C and monitored by 11 B NMR spectroscopy. Although quite slow, the catalytic dehydrocoupling protocol illustrated by Scheme 2 provided clean and selective conversion to the dimerized species [(H 2 BNMe 2 ) 2 ] over the course of 72 h. A number of notable features were also apparent from inspection of the 11 B NMR spectra recorded during the dehydrocoupling process ( Figure 4) . The presence of a BH 2 unit of an intermediate analogous to the Mg-coordinated [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 species observed in the well-defined compounds 1 and 2 was inferred from the presence of a low intensity triplet at about 4 ppm ( 1 J HB = 101 Hz) throughout the reaction. An additional quartet resonance at approximately \u00c09 ppm ( 1 J HB = 92 Hz) was not assigned to the corresponding BH 3 component of the anion, on the basis of the signal intensity and the lower field chemical shift compared to those observed in either 1 or 2, Rather, on the basis of a 11 B-11 B correlation experiment, this low intensity signal is proposed to be obscured by the quartet resonance of the Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 starting material and it is notable that Weller and co-workers have recently made similar deductions during studies of the Rhcatalyzed dehydrocoupling of the same substrate. [4i] Having tentatively assigned a similar downfield triplet resonance to the trimerized species [(H 2 BNMe 2 ) 3 ] in their original communication, [4e] this group later revised their assignment of this resonance as arising from the BH 2 unit of the neutral product III. Through comparison to the deshielded environments observed for heavier metal derivatives of the same ligA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G ands (see below), the more intense downfield signal at \u00c09 ppm is proposed to arise from a magnesium-coordinated anion derived by deprotonation of a single equivalent of the Me 2 NH\u00b7BH 3 starting material. The diaminoborane HB-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (NMe 2 ) 2 was also observed at early stages of, and throughout, the course of the reaction. Although the reaction of HBA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (NMe 2 ) 2 with diborane has been reported to result in longer chain amine-boranes, [8b] this species was not consumed and our supposition is that this species is formed through a parallel but less significant reaction pathway involving elimination of a b-hydride from the coordinated [H 3 BNMe 2 BH 2 Me 2 N] \u00c0 ion followed by loss of BH 3 . [17] A similar b-hydride elimination has been proposed to occur during the magnesium-catalyzed production of [HB{NH-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (Dipp)} 2 ] from (Dipp)NH 2 BH 3. [6a] Although in this last case the occurrence of BH 3 elimination was supported by the isolation of a magnesium tetrahydridoborate, we have observed no evidence for this process and assume that BH 3 is dis-placed as B 2 H 6 and one of the, as yet, unmonitored gaseous by-products.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 543, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "[4i]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1637, "text": "[4e]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2639, "end": 2643, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2823, "text": "[6a]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 604, "end": 613, "text": "Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "We have recently reported a series of homoleptic Group 2 bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl derivatives of the form [M{CH-", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": ", which can function as basic derivatives for the exploration of heavier alkaline earth reaction chemistry.

Data were processed using the Nonius Software. [26] Structure solution, followed by full-matrix leastsquares refinement was performed using the programme suite X-SEED throughout. [27] For 2 C1, C2, C3, C4, and B1 were disordered over two sites in an 80:20 ratio. The 80 % fractions were refined anisotropically. N\u00c0C distances were restrained to be similar where disorder of the carbon was present. Hydrogens attached to boron atoms were included at calculated positions, which coincided closely with residual electron density evident in the penultimate difference Fourier Map. For 4 data were collected at 240 K, as the crystal underwent a phase transition at 150 K. Data were truncated to a q value of 258 due to a fall off in diffraction at higher resolution. H1a and H1b were located and refined subject to being simi-lar distances from B1. The asymmetric unit consists of half of a molecule with atoms Ca1, O1, N2, B1, C17, and C20 located on a mirror plane intrinsic to the space group. This necessarily means that C18 and C19 are disordered over two positions in a 50:50 ratio.
