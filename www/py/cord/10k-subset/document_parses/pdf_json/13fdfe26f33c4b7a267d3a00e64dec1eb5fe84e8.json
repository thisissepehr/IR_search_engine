Progress to date through multiple sets of initiatives and partners to contain or eliminate these parasites has been hampered due to a wide range of organizational, financial, and health systems-level challenges. In this commentary, a set of seven specific and concrete actions are proposed to directly address these issues and to accelerate P. falciparum elimination within the Greater Mekong Subregion to avert a wider public health crisis. These actions are specifically needed to elevate the situation and response mechanisms to those of a true emergency; to address systems-level challenges with personnel limitations and stock-outs of key commodities; and to restructure the response mechanisms to be well-aligned with the required outcomes. Consideration of these issues is especially pressing with planning meetings for renewal of the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI) framework slated for late 2016 and into 2017, but these suggestions are also relevant for malaria programmes globally.",

Evidence suggests the parasite mutates under intense drug pressure, and this has occurred at multiple sites independently within the GMS [3] ; the genetic markers of artemisinin resistance (specific Kelch-13 mutations) have now been identified throughout Myanmar [4] and now encroach upon the Indian subcontinent ( Fig. 1) .

It is somewhat difficult to reconcile this action with the current situation in the GMS; MDR-P. falciparum certainly poses an equally grave international threat.

If or when these parasites spread to sub-Saharan Africa, the world can expect major impacts. Evolution of resistance to chloroquine is estimated to have caused two-to six-fold increases in malaria mortality and morbidity throughout sub-Saharan Africa [12] , and modelling suggests the potential for ACT failures to cause 10 to 78 million additional malaria cases over a 4-year period [13] .",

Most national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) in the region have limitations in stock-level tracking and management, and so organizations with specialists in supply chain management should be supported to form a consortium of partners with key expertise and incentivized to directly assist with logistics and commodity distribution wherever needed, towards achieving \"zero stock-outs. \"",

It is often that latter that suffers, hampering regional progress. One potential avenue to address this issue is externally funded support for programme and technical management. This could, for example, consist of two full-time support positions within each GMS countryone dedicated to policy and technical issues, the other for finances and on-the-ground project management, but needs would vary in each programme.
