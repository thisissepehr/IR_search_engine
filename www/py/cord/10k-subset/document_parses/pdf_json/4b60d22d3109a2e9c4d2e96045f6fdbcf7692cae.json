Unlike influenza A and B which contain two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA), influenza C contains a single membrane glycoprotein which performs several functions critical to viral infection. The protein contains a binding site specific tbr cellsurface receptors containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid. A distinct enzyme active site functions as a receptordestroying 9-O-acetylesterase. The glycoprotein also mediates the fusion of the virus and host membranes at the low pH encountered in endosomes, enabling the virus genome to enter the cytoplasm. The glycoprotein is thus a hemagglutininesterase-fusion factor (HEF) (Formanowksi, Wharton, Calder, Hol%auer & Meier-Ewert, 1990; Herrler & Klenk, 1991; Herder, DiJrkop, Becht & Klenk, 1988) .",

            "text": "Influenza C virus can be distinguished electron microscopically from influenza A and B by the presence of an hexagonal array of glycoprotein on the virus membrane. Image reconstructions from electron micrographs of negativestained virions at 30A resolution suggest these arrays are formed by trimeric glycoproteins similar in size and shape to the influenza A HA (Hewatt, Cusack, Ruigrok & Verwey, 1984) . HEF is a trimer of the disulfide-linked polypeptides HEF 1 and HEF 2, with a total of 24 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Like the HA, cleavage of HEF into the two glycopolypeptides, HEF~ (65kDa, 432 residues) and HEF 2 (30 kDa, 209 residues), is required tbr the membrane- Ewert, 1979; Ohuchi, Ohuchi & Mifune, 1982; Kitame, Sugawara, Ohwada & Homma, 1982; . However, HEF has less than 15% sequence identity to the HA (Nakada, Creager, Krystal, Aaronson & Palese, 1984; Pfeifer & Compans, 1984) . HEF~ is 104 amino acids longer than influenza A HA 1. It contains the enzyme active site, serine 71 has been identified as the catalytic active-site serine, and the nature of the flanking residues suggests that the protein defines a new class of serine esterases (Herder, Multhaup, Beyreuther & Klenk, 1988; Vlasak, Muster, Lauro, Powers & Palese, 1989; Hayes & Varki, 1989) . HEF~ is similar in length to influenza A HA 2 and contains the C-terminal transmembrane anchor which we have removed by bromelain digestion (see below). The N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide of HEF 2 \"is unusual among fusion peptides found in enveloped viruses in containing two aspartic acids at residues 5 and 6 (Nakada et al., 1984; Pfeifer & Compans, 1984) . The time course of influenza C virus membrane fusion shows a kinetic lag which suggests that it may be possible to observe intermediate steps in the HEF-mediated fusion mechanism. .",

The glycoprotein was isolated using the conditions described by Formanowski & Meier-Ewert (Formanowski & Meier-Ewert, 1988 ) with some modifications. Virus was suspended at 2 mg m1-1 in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100mM NaCI, 10mM CaC12, 0.1% NAN3). Bromelain digestion was accomplished by adding 2-mercaptoethanol to 0.05M, bromelain (Sigma) to 0.5mg per mg of virus, and incubating at 306 K for 18 h. Digested virus was then pelleted at 100000g for 1 h. Supernatant was place in a centricon 100 (Amicon, 100 kDa MW cutoff) and the volume reduced to 1/10 and then diluted with buffer B (10mM Tris-HC1 pH 7.4, 140 mM NaC1, 10 mM CaC12, 0.1% NAN3). The dilution and concentration steps were repeated several times until bromelain (MW 33 kDa) had passed through the membrane and only briEF was retained in the concentrate. The volume was further reduced until the briEF concentration was at least 10 mg ml -~ . In some cases the protease inhibitor E64 was used to stop bromelain activity.",

Examination of the diffraction data and the native Patterson function suggests that form II is pseudo-Ccentered. In Fig. 2(b) , a plot of average I for reciprocalspace planes h + k = n is given. Reduced intensity for h + k odd is evidence for pseudo-C-centering. The native Patterson function calculated for form II shows a large peak near U : \u00bd, V = l, W = 0 as shown in Fig. 2(c) . This peak is interpreted as a translation vector (~,~, 0) between non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecules within the asymmetric unit lying in similar orientations.

(a) The diagram shows a comparison of the unit-cell axes of both crystal forms as viewed down their common c axis. Form I P4122: four unit cells are represented as four squares with edges parallel to the a and b axes. Form II P41212: a single unit cell is represented by a shaded square with edges parallel to the a' and b' axes. The 217 A axes of form II, are approximately the same length as the ab diagonals of form I. A unit cell of the form II lattice has twice the volume of the form I unit cell and is rotated by 45'. (b) Analysis of diffraction data from form II crystals. Average intensity is plotted for the reciprocal-space planes h + k = n. Intensity is greater for h + k even, evidence for pseudo-C-centering. (c) U, V, W ---1.6 section of the form II native Patterson map. A section from U = 0 to 1.0, V = 0 to 1.0 (entire unit cell) is shown. Pseudo-C-centering is indicated by peaks near U = V = ~. Contours are drawn at 0.5RMS density of the map starting at 0.5RMS. The large nonorigin peaks in each asymmetric unit are interpreted as translation vectors of approximately (1. ~, 0) between non-crystallographically related molecules lying in similar orientations\u2022",
