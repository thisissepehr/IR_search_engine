First, AIAT compared with IIAT was associated with a halving of 30-day mortality (unadjusted summary OR = 0.48). This significance persisted in subgroup analyses, when appropriate antibiotics were initiated within 48 h, in blood stream infections, and among patients admitted to the hospital wards. Although there were no studies to draw conclusions for < 24-h or 24-to-48-h time points, this review demonstrates that a 48h time point is a possible threshold beyond which a significantly higher mortality risk is observed with further delays in AIAT.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, the choice of an initial antibiotic therapy against a possible P. aeruginosa infection has been a challenge owing, in part, to different resistance trends, mechanisms of resistance and evolution of resistance. For example, resistance to the carbapenem class, an important class of initial therapy in severe nosocomial infections, is now reported to be more than 70% in some hospitals in the LATAM region [32] . Indeed, a number of individual studies exist in the public domain examining risk factors associated with resistant P. aeruginosa infections in LATAM. Notably, prior use of antibiotics (11 studies), stay in the ICU (3 studies), and comorbidity score (3 studies) were significant predictors of acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa. The mechanisms of resistance and variation in resistance based on the type of antibiotics can present some complexities in targeting antibiotic therapyinvolving either acquisition of genes against betalactams and aminoglycosides, or mutation of chromosomal genes in the case of resistance against fluoroquinolones [33] . These challenges may result in delays in the initiation and administration of appropriate antibiotics that can lead to adverse patient outcomes.

For example, P. aeruginosa has evolved virulence characteristics that may make it a difficult target for antibiotic therapy. Resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are the most frequent source of HAIs and are often associated with overuse or inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Our review highlights that there was a consistent association between prior use of antimicrobials and acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa. Our findings concur with many other studies that showed exposure to previous antimicrobial therapy prior to the development of current infection can lead an increased risk of resistance to different classes of antibiotics [34] . A thorough understanding of risk factors associated with acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa can aid in the monitoring of resistant pathogens in order to prevent emergence of MDR/XDR/pan-drug resistant pathogens. More importantly, knowledge about these risk factors can help tailor presumptively better antimicrobials to be used. This review and meta-analysis have several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, there was no previously published systematic review and meta-analysis from the LATAM region comparing AIAT with IIAT and systematically reviewed studies from the LATAM region evaluating multivariate risk factors predicting acquisition of P. aeruginosa. This review included studies published in English, Spanish and Portuguese languages from the LATAM region. Additionally, this review comprehensively searched for studies indexed in regional databases. The overall results from this review are consistent with other systematic reviews published literature from other regions that compare the role of AIAT with IIAT in mortality [8, 35, 36] . Nonetheless, in light of a few limitations, the results of the systematic review and metaanalysis should be interpreted with caution. There was a general lack of studies reporting adjusted analyses for mortality outcomes. Therefore, our meta-analysis is restricted to unadjusted results comparing AIAT with IIAT that did not account for potential confounders. Overall, risk of bias among individual studies was high and there was inconsistencies across studies. The majority of studies were retrospective observational studies. This translated into a low overall strength of evidence that was confirmed by a formal evaluation of the GRADE to assess the overall strength of evidence. The impact of AIAT versus IIAT on treatment response, length of stay, and costs in the LATAM region is unknown because there were no studies evaluating these outcomes. In addition, studies either did not clearly define AIAT and IIAT, or lacked consistent definitions on timeliness and susceptibility to antimicrobial therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 696, "end": 700, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1752, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1756, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1760, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The following gaps in the literature merit consideration for future research.

AIAT against a possible infection has been a challenge owing, in part, to different resistance trends in several regions of the world. In addition to implementation of infection control programs in hospitals, a thorough understanding of local epidemiology and better laboratory facilities are essential in targeting appropriate antibiotic. Given the high resistance rates in the LATAM region and the worse outcomes associated with P. aeruginosa infections, there is a continued need for the use of appropriate antimicrobial agents with activity against P. aeruginosa.
