            "text": "In the present study, novel EIT-based method titrating mPaw under HFOV was proposed and evaluated in ARDS model. The titration results were compared with oxygenation method and the effects on lung homogeneity were examined. We found that the individual mPaw titrated by EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution with respect to overdistension and collapse and the suggested mPaw may not always match the ones proposed by oxygenation method. HFOV may remain a tool in managing patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia and not the firstline treatment for ARDS patient. HFOV with high mPaw values applied in both two trials [25, 26] might contribute to negative clinical outcome on ARDS patients and canceled out the positive effects. HFOV using Paw set according to a static P-V curve [16] , oxygenation, mean airway pressure during CMV [27] , and transpulmonary pressure [17] has been examined in clinical and animal studies, but the bedside monitoring base on ventilation distribution is lacking. In the present study, we provide new mPaw titration method in respect of regional ventilation distribution that improves lung homogeneity. The increased mPaw lead to more lung tissue hyperinflated, and the EIT-CoV decrease, which revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions. A critical issue of this EIT-based method was the pre-defined threshold used to identify lung regions. Further studies are required to confirm if the threshold used in the present study is optimal for various subjects and conditions. The reliability of EIT has been confirmed and EIT has been used in clinic setting and adjust of CMV. EIT has been used in PEEP titration and tidal volume setting by comparison with various conventional methods, such as CT [28] , single-photon-emission computed tomography [29] , positron emission tomography [30] , and pneumotachography [31] . Previous studies have already shown that EIT was able to monitor ventilation distribution during HFOV in preterm infants and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [22, 32] . The optimal settings based on oxygenation were comparable to EIT-CoV and EIT-regional ventilation distribution. It was also observed that overdistended regions were large at the mPaw selected with oxygenation method in several pigs. PF ratio is an invasive method with a certain time delay in response to pressure changes. Although the average values between EIT-derived measures were not very different, individual differences could be large (up to 6 cmH 2 O, Figs. 2 and 3) . Hence, mPaw titration with EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution while titration aiming oxygenation was not always the case. Besides, it is worth to note that EIT is currently the only bedside non-invasive tool to assess overdistension. Further investigation should be conducted in future clinical studies. Number of pixels is presented as Black asterisk (recruitable lung region) and red circles (overdistended lung region) with the optimal mPaw were defined with oxygenation (Upper). The number of pixels is presented as black crosses (recruitable lung region) and red squares (overdistended lung region) with the optimal mPaw were defined with EIT-based center of ventilation index (lower x-axis) as well (lower) Our study has some limitations. First, as an experimental study, these data were obtained in animals and its clinical impact may be limited. Therefore, the optimal mPaw selected in the present study might be not suitable with that in ARDS patients. Second, HFOV should not be employed in the absence of well-trained expertise because of its complexity. Further validation study to assess the feasibility of such strategies in ARDS patients with proposed method should be conducted.",
