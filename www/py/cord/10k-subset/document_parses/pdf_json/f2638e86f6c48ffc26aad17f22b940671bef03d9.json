The failure to find a pathogen for a minority of patients may be due in part to the relative insensitivity of some of the techniques used, such as testing a pool of 10 colonies of E. coli for toxin production rather than testing multiple individual isolates [8] . Also, the assays we used could not detect some agents of diarrhea, including bacterial pathogens such as invasive or enteropathogenic E. coli, Campylobacter fetus, and Yersinia enterocolitica and viruses such as parvovirus-like agents and other recently reported particles (adenoviruses, caliciviruses, coronaviruslike agents) that may be associated with diarrhea [16] [17] [18] [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 252, "end": 255, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 667, "end": 670, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1041, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1056, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Patients with cholera were generally more severely dehydrated than patients with diarrhea associated with other pathogens, including LTand ST/LT-producing E. coli, which produce an enterotoxin similar to that of V. cholerae.

Our experience with the two solutions, each used for one year of this study in a center annually treating 6,000-8,000 patients with diarrhea, supports this conclusion in that the case-fatality rates for the two years of study were comparable. ETEC organisms were the pathogens most frequently isolated from patients of all ages and were the second most frequently isolated (after rotavirus) from young children coming to the treatment center in rural Bangladesh. Our study indicates that rotavirus is the most common pathogen for children less than two years of age visiting a treatment center for diarrhea; this finding is in agreement with other studies in both developed and developing countries [3, 4, 12, 13] . Older children and adults may also have had symptomatic infections caused by rotavirus, but because of frequent concomitant infections with other pathogens it is difficult to determine whether rotavirus caused diarrhea for the infected adults in this study. In this highly endemic area cholera remains an important cause of life-threatening diarrhea.
