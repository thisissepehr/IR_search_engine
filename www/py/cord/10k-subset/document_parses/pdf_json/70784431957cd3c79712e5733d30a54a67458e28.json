To clarify the effects of FAdV-4 on immune organs in birds, we conducted a detailed examination of dynamic morphology and damage mechanisms in chickens randomly divided into 4 groups (FAdV-4, vaccination, FAdV-4 plus vaccination, and control). FAdV-4 caused the depletion of lymphocytes and subsequent growth impairment in the thymus and bursa. Chickens infected with FAdV-4 and subjected to vaccination experienced greater inhibition of antibody responses to inactivated vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian influenza virus subtype H9 than uninfected and vaccinated chickens. The mechanisms underlying adenovirus-mediated lymphoid organ damage were further investigated via transferase-mediated dUTP nickend labeling and apoptotic genes transcription analyses. Notably, lymphocytes apoptosis in lymphoid organs and expression of specific gene transcripts was significantly upregulated after infection (P < 0.05). Furthermore, increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 mRNA was observed (P < 0.05), compared to the control group. Our collective findings suggested that FAdV-4 caused structural and functional damage of immune organs via apoptosis along with induction of a severe inflammatory response.",

            "text": "Hydropericardium syndrome (HPS), prevalent in commercial chicken farms in China since mid-2015, causes high mortality in diseased chickens resulting in tremendous economic losses to poultry farmers (Li et al., 2016; Niu et al., 2016; Ruan et al., 2018) . Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the causative agent of HPS (Lobanov et al., 2000; Schachner et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016) . At present, HPS is distinguished by accumulation of a clear, straw-colored fluid in the pericardial sac as well as acute and hemorrhagic hepatitis (Lobanov et al., 2000; Schachner et al., 2014) . The majority of previous studies have thus focused on the pathogenesis of FAdV-4 in heart and liver (Niu et al., 2018a,b) . In the poultry industry, co-infections with FAdVs and other pathogens are detected regularly (Ojkic et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2012; Kaj\u00e1n et al., 2013) . However, limited evidence on the immunosuppressive activity of FAdV-4 in chickens is available in the lit-erature. In natural HPS cases, necrosis of lymphocytes has been observed in chicken immune organs. In the current study, we conducted a detailed examination of the dynamic morphology and damage mechanisms with a view to determining the effects of FAdV-4 on immune organs.",

Apoptosis is a physiological and pathological phenomenon. Excessive apoptosis can lead to physical dysfunction. Infection with pathogenic viruses can lead to activation of the apoptotic machinery in infected cells (Levine, 2005; Radke et al., 2014) . Viruses additionally use apoptosis to escape antiviral host activity and maintain survival and replication (Zhong et al., 2012; Pruijssers et al., 2013) . Viral infections are recognized initially via Rig-I-like or Toll-like receptors (Kawai and Akira, 2008) . Signaling through these receptors elicits the release of numerous cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 (Manicassamy and Pulendran, 2009) , which, in turn, triggers an inflammatory response that recruits antiviral cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes (Barlan et al., 2011) . However, excessive inflammation can also damage the tissue. : 5 -ATGGATGCCTGTCTGTCCTGTTC-3  106  R: 5 -GCAGAGCAGTCCAAAGACACTGA-3  Bcl2  F: 5 -CAGAGGGACTTCGCCCAGAT-3  148  R: 5 -ACATCACGCCGCCGAACT-3  P53  F: 5 -CAGAGGGACTTCGCCCAGAT-3  120  R: 5 -ACATCACGCCGCCGAACT-3  Caspase3 F: 5 -ACTCTGGAA ATTCTGCCTGATGACA-3 129 R: 5 -CATCTGCATCCGTGCCTGA-3 Il6 F: 5 -CCAGAAATCCCTCCTCGCCAATC-3 111 R: 5 -GCCCTCACGGTCTTCTCCATAAAC-3 Il8 F: 5 -GCTCTGTCGCAAGGTAGGA-3 117 R: 5 -TGGCGTCAGCTTCACATCT-3 Tnf\u03b1 F: 5 -TACTCAGGACAGCCTATGCCAACA-3 178 R: 5 -CACCACACGACAGCCAAGTCAA-3 Figure 1.

The results indicated that the FAdV-4 strain triggered depletion of lymphocytes and growth impairment in thymus and bursa. Interestingly, spleen-body weight and wet-dry weight ratios in spleen of the FAdV-4 group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Necrosis of lymphocytes in the cortex of spleen was observed at 3 to 5 dpi. Theoretically, the spleen is rich in blood and congestion is often observed under conditions of heart failure (Mebius and Kraal, 2005) . Therefore, formation of pericardial effusion is speculated to splenic congestion, and the organ index consequently becomes larger. Viral loads were consistent in the lymphoid organs but remained high in spleen. Further investigations focusing on viral location in these organs should aid in determining the level of damage.",

As expected, Caspase-3 mRNA was significantly upregulated at 4 to 5 dpi in 3 organs. Caspase proteins play important roles in the decisive stage of apoptosis (Belmokhtar et al., 2011) . In the majority of apoptosis-inducing processes, transcriptional levels of caspases are significantly increased. Caspase-3 is an important effector molecule in the caspase cascade activation that, once activated, triggers characteristic apoptotic changes in cells (Green, 1998; Thomberry and Littlewood, 1998; Rogers et al., 2017) . In our experiments, pro-apoptotic Bax and P53 genes were significantly increased at different time points in the 3 lymphoid organs (Wei et al., 2016) . Interestingly, Bcl2, an inhibitor of apoptotic genes, was also upregulated at 3, 4, and 3 dpi in thymus, spleen, and brusa, respectively. However, Bax and Bcl-2 combine to form a heterodimer, which leads to loss of the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on apoptosis (Qin et al., 2015; Kvansakul et al., 2017) . Preliminary data suggested that FAdV-4 induced lymphocyte apoptosis, which would promote lymph organ damage. However, the specific apoptotic pathways and mechanisms remain to be elucidated.",

Western blot analyses to assess protein expression should be conducted to further support these findings. However, commercial poultry antibodies were not easily available and ELISA kits were not sufficiently sensitive in detecting specific cytokine contents in poultry tissue. Therefore, mRNA measurement presents a good alternative to detect transcriptional levels in the absence of available poultry antibodies. These cytokines are considered the most important signaling molecules in the induction and regulation of the inflammatory response (Laurent et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2009; Sanchez et al., 2011) . Increased transcription of inflammatory factors promotes inflammation, further inducing accumulation of various inflammatory cells and release of several soluble inflammatory regulators, reactive oxygen species, lipid regulators, proteases and cytokines, and subsequent tissue damage (Bhargava et al., 2013; Mirantes et al., 2014; Pourgholaminejad et al., 2016) .",
