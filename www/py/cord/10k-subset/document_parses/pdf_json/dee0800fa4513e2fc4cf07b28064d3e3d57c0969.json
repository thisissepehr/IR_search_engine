Therefore, effective vaccines against H5N1 viruses are needed to counter the potential threat of a global pandemic. We have previously developed a fast-acting and efficacious vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform. In this study, we generated recombinant VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus vectors to demonstrate the feasibility of this platform for a fast-acting pan-H5 influenza virus vaccine. We chose multiple approaches regarding antigen design and genome location to define a more optimized vaccine approach. After the VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus constructs were recovered and characterized in vitro, mice were vaccinated by a single dose or prime/boost regimen followed by challenge with a lethal dose of the homologous H5 clade 1 virus. We found that a single dose of VSV vectors expressing full-length hemagglutinin (HAfl) were sufficient to provide 100% protection. The vaccine vectors were fast-acting as demonstrated by uniform protection when administered 3 days prior to lethal challenge.

Subtypes H1-16 HA and N1-9 NA have been isolated from water birds, the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses. 3, 4 Until 1997, avian influenza A viruses were considered unlikely to be transmitted directly to humans because they do not bind the human sialic acid-\u03b12,6-galactose (SA\u03b12,6Gal) receptor with high affinity. 5 However, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses can be transmitted from wild birds upon close contact causing sporadic outbreaks in domestic poultry.

This difference could be due to the favorable immune cell targeting of the EBOV GP, 30,48-50 but further studies with bigger animal group sizes are needed to prove this hypothesis. Previous studies demonstrated that VSV-based vaccines provide rapid protection via involvement of the innate immune system combined with an early adaptive response, 26 suggesting that the VSV-EBOV-HAfl and VSV-HAfl vaccines may induce innate immune responses that are able to control the challenge virus, allow for the adaptive immune system to catch up and lead to protection of the mice. Nevertheless, the fast-acting feature makes this vaccine extremely valuable for the public health response during an epidemic or pandemic as the vaccine could be strategically administered to more vulnerable populations such as elderly and hospitalized people keeping in mind the replicative nature of the vaccine vectors. VSV-based H5 influenza virus vaccine candidates have advantages compared to the currently used influenza virus vaccines including the ease of generation of the vectors as well as the vaccine production in cell lines which are already approved for manufacturing of human vaccines. 51 A switch to cell line production would eliminate concerns regarding allergies to egg proteins. The downside of an attenuated, replication-competent vaccine approach such as VSV is adverse reactions to vaccination. However, previous preclinical vaccine work using the VSV platform, including immunization of several immunecompromised animal species, as well as clinical trials with VSV-EBOV demonstrated low levels of vaccine-related adverse effects resulting in the general conclusion that the VSV vaccine platform is safe. 27, 28 In addition, VSV-based replicating vaccines are efficacious at lower doses compared to non-replicating approaches and do not require adjuvants. 52 In conclusion, we have developed two VSV-based vaccine candidates, VSV-EBOV-HAfl and VSV-HAfl, that provide proof-ofconcept for rapid protection against HPAI virus infection that are mediating cross-neutralizing responses.
