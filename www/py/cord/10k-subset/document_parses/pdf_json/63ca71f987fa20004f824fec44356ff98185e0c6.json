Of note, none of our patients presented with cannula local infectious signs at any moment during ECMO support and even during the 48 following hours.

Fifteen patients (16%) presented cannula-related infection [22] . ECMO device-related infections may involve the drainage cannula, the return cannula or the membrane oxygenator (MO). Thus, Kuehn et al. [23] hypothesised that the artificial surfaces of the ECMO circuit, particularly the MO, could be the target of microbial adhesion and colonisation, favouring the development of ECMO-related bloodstream infection.

During the study period, central venous catheter-related infection rate was 1.2 per 1000 catheter days. ECMO cannula size is bigger (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) and duration of ECMO longer than central venous catheter. Moreover, cannula change is highly problematic because of the few vascular accesses and due to patient's vital dependence on ECMO support.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 245, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 256, "end": 260, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 266, "end": 270, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 276, "end": 280, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 281, "end": 285, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 1 General characteristics of ECMO in patients without infected/colonised ECMO device, with ECMO device colonisation and ECMO device infection (at the time of ECMO removal)"}, {"text": "Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent nosocomial infections in ECMO patients remains highly controversial due to the emergence of resistance to antibiotics and Clostridium difficile-associated colitis [25] . Daily surveillance blood cultures have been proposed as an alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis and remain a routine practice in many ECMO centres, but this strategy is costly and resource consuming [9, 19, 26] . Wide variability in practice is also noted regarding the prevention of nosocomial and bloodstream infections for patients requiring ECMO. In a recent survey of the ELSO members interested in nosocomial bloodstream infection prevention practice, only one-quarter of respondents reported the use of a bundle or checklist during ECMO cannula insertion and less than half utilise a bundle or checklist for cannula maintenance [27] . In our opinion, if daily surveillance blood culture in patients with ECMO support should not be recommended, the systematic culture of vascular cannula portions associated with blood culture performed at the time of removal may help the clinician to make the diagnosis of ECMO device-related infection and guide the antibiotics prescription. Finally, we did not use chlorhexidine antiseptic protocol at the time of Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing for cannula dressing was not used in our study which could be evaluated in the future to evaluate the impact on the rate of ECMO device colonisation and infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 201, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 404, "end": 407, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 408, "end": 411, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 412, "end": 415, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 1 General characteristics of ECMO in patients without infected/colonised ECMO device, with ECMO device colonisation and ECMO device infection (at the time of ECMO removal)"}, {"text": "Our study presents several limitations. There is currently no consensus on the definition of ECMO devicerelated infection. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines have established a clear definition of central line-related infection or blood stream infections that precisely exclude ECMO devices [14] . Moreover, the definitions that include differential time to blood culture positivity appear to be inappropriate given the impossibility and danger of performing blood culture in ECMO cannulae [13, 28] . We have decided to use the threshold of 10 3 colony-forming unit for the positivity of the device culture, which is derived from catheter infection literature but not validated for the ECMO device so far. At least, our study focused on ECMO device infection and colonisation at the time of removal and not during the ECMO support period. Moreover, the huge majority of our patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of ECMO insertion and during the ECMO run. These two last elements could have led to possible underestimation of the number of infections and colonisations. We did not collected data regarding dressing disruption or changes that might help to explain the differences between the rate of colonisation and the rate of infection. Using a multinomial logistic regression procedure, we failed to establish factors associated with ECMO device colonisation or infection, probably because of the cohort size.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 527, "end": 531, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 532, "end": 535, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 1 General characteristics of ECMO in patients without infected/colonised ECMO device, with ECMO device colonisation and ECMO device infection (at the time of ECMO removal)"}, {"text": "At the time of ECMO removal, systematic blood culture and intravascular extremity cannula culture may help to diagnose ECMO device-related infection.
