They encode an NS6 protease that cleaves a viral polyprotein at specific sites to produce mature viral proteins. In an earlier study we obtained crystals of murine norovirus (MNV) NS6 protease in which crystal contacts were mediated by specific insertion of the C-terminus of one protein (which contains residues P5-P1 of the NS6-7 cleavage junction) into the peptide binding site of an adjacent molecule, forming an adventitious protease-product complex. We sought to reproduce this crystal form to investigate protease-substrate complexes by extending the C-terminus of NS6 construct to include residues on the C-terminal (P \u2032 ) side of the cleavage junction. We report the crystallization and crystal structure determination of inactive mutants of murine norovirus NS6 protease with C-terminal extensions of one, two and four residues from the N-terminus of the adjacent NS7 protein (NS6 1 \u2032 , NS6 2 \u2032 , NS6 4 \u2032 ). We also determined the structure of a chimeric extended NS6 protease in which the P4-P4 \u2032 sequence of the NS6-7 cleavage site was replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NS2-3 cleavage junction (NS6 4 \u2032 2|3).The constructs NS6 1 \u2032 and NS6 2 \u2032 yielded crystals that diffracted anisotropically. We found that, although the uncorrected data could be phased by molecular replacement, refinement of the structures stalled unless the data were ellipsoidally truncated and corrected with anisotropic B-factors. These corrections significantly improved phasing by molecular replacement and subsequent refinement.The refined structures of all four extended NS6 proteases are very similar in structure to the mature MNV NS6-and in one case reveal additional details of a surface loop. Although the packing arrangement observed showed some similarities to those observed in the adventitious proteaseproduct crystals reported previously, in no case were specific protease-substrate interactions observed.

Strikingly, adventitious crystal contacts placed the C-terminus of one molecule in the active site of another, thereby generating the structure of a protease-product complex that plausibly represents the final step of the trans cleavage by NS6 at the NS6-NS7 junction. An almost identical packing arrangement was obtained in a different space-group with crystals of Norwalk virus NS6 protease (Muhaxhiri et al., 2013) . These structures, together with the structures of di-, tri-and penta-peptidyl substrate analogues bound to human norovirus NS6 structures (Hussey et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012; Muhaxhiri et al., 2013) revealed details of the specific contacts made by the P5-P1 residues of peptidyl products of the protease (Fig. 1) ; in particular they showed the anchoring of P1-Gln by specific H-bond interactions with Thr 134 and His 157 (Fig. 1A) , and the accommodation of the hydrophobic side-chains of P2-Phe and P4-Leu in apolar pockets (Fig. 1B) . However, to date there are no structural data on protease-substrate complexes that might uncover details of the interactions made by the protease with the C-terminal, prime side of noroviral peptide cleavage junctions (residues P1 \u2032 -P4 \u2032 ). The N-and C-terminal domains of one protease molecule are coloured green and orange respectively. The C-terminus of an adjacent protease that is accommodated specifically in the substrate-binding site (residues P1-P5) is shown as a stick model with grey carbon atoms. Hydrogen-bonds are indicated as dashed lines. (B) Same view as in (A) but with the protease surface shown to illustrate the binding pockets involved in substrate recognition. This figure is a modified version of Fig. 3 We reasoned that catalytically inactive MNV NS6 constructs extended at the C-terminus might be able to crystallise with the same packing contacts as we had observed for the full-length protein, and that this could therefore give us a convenient way to investigate the structures of NS6-substrate complexes. To this end we extended an inactive MNV NS6 construct (which incorporates a C139A mutation to knock out the active site nucleophile) by adding residues from NS7, which is immediately downstream in the polyprotein. We made three constructs, NS6 1 \u2032 , NS6 2 \u2032 and NS6 4 \u2032 , which were extended by 1, 2 and 4 residues respectively, generating proteases that contain substrates that correspond to P4-P1 \u2032 , P4-P2 \u2032 and P4-P4 \u2032 of the NS6-NS7 cleavage junction. To investigate the structural variation in substrate recognition we also made an NS6 chimera which interchanged the residues P4-P4 \u2032 of the NS6-7 cleavage junction with the sequence of the NS2-3 junction from MNV (NS6 4 \u2032 2|3).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 124, "text": "(Leen, Baeza & Curry, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 520, "end": 544, "text": "(Muhaxhiri et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 685, "end": 706, "text": "(Hussey et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 707, "end": 724, "text": "Kim et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 725, "end": 748, "text": "Muhaxhiri et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 855, "end": 863, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 973, "end": 982, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1086, "text": "(Fig. 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1817, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Proteins expressed from all four constructs were crystallised and their structures determined at high resolution by X-ray crystallography.

Unfortunately, in no case did the packing arrangements involve insertion of the cleavage junction in the extended C-terminus into the active site of an adjacent protein in a way that allowed the formation of specific protease-substrate interactions.

In preliminary investigations using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate solution structures of extended MNV NS6 protease structures, we have obtained evidence to suggest that their C-termini may have a propensity to fold into the active site of the molecule that it belongs to, making a cis interaction (H Fernandes, 2015, unpublished data) .
