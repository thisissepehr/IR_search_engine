Biodiversity effects might increase agricultural yields at no cost in additional inputs. However, the effects of diversity on crop assemblages are inconsistent, probably because crops and wild plants differ in a range of traits relevant to plant-plant interactions. We tested whether domestication has changed the potential of crop mixtures to over-yield by comparing the performance and traits of major crop species and those of their wild progenitors under varying levels of diversity. We found stronger biodiversity effects in mixtures of wild progenitors, due to larger selection effects. Variation in selection effects was partly explained by within-mixture differences in leaf size. Our results indicate that domestication might disrupt the ability of crops to benefit from diverse neighbourhoods via reduced trait variance. These results highlight potential limitations of current crop mixtures to over-yield and the potential of breeding to re-establish variance and increase mixture performance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Global agricultural production needs to rise by 60-110% to accommodate the projected demands for food by 2050 (Tilman et al. 2011 ).

Therefore, farming practices that increase crop production in a sustainable way are needed. The promotion and management of biodiversity effects, that is, higher productivity of species mixtures than expected from their respective monocultures, might contribute to address this challenge (Brooker et al. 2015; Isbell et al. 2017; Martin-Guay et al. 2018) .

Further traits that might have changed after crop domestication can be relevant for plant performance in mixtures. For example, increased plant canopy height and leaf area after domestication (Milla et al. 2014; suggest that crops are stronger competitors for light than their wild progenitors. Additionally, genetic bottlenecks (due to selection processes by early farmers) and crop breeding for maximum monoculture yield have substantially reduced the genetic diversity of crops (Tanksley & Mccouch 1997; Doebley et al. 2006; Zeder 2006) .

Current genotypes of major arable crops were selected to maximise yields in monospecific stands (Weiner et al. 2017) , which entailed adaptations to perform in an intraspecific neighbourhood (e.g. high phenological synchrony). In contrast, wild plants composing the natural and seminatural grasslands typical of BEF experiments, as well as crop wild progenitors, have evolved in mixed plant communities for their entire evolutionary history. Local adaptations to a diverse neighbourhood can evolve over short-time periods and differently depending on the biotic (Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) and abiotic conditions (i.e. elevated CO 2 ; Kleynhans et al. 2016) . Indeed, competitive hierarchies and further adaptations through niche differentiation or facilitation (which are the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects) are more likely to evolve in diverse communities than in monospecific stands (Sch\u20ac ob et al. 2018) . A recent study found that biodiversity effects in mixtures of genotypes with a recent history of coexistence were higher than in mixtures of genotypes with a monoculture history (Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) . Importantly, in a short period of 8 years of coselection history in mixtures, plants evolved adaptations to improve over-yielding (Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) .

In our experiment, SEs were much stronger than CEs. Selection effects are frequently disregarded as relevant contributors to over-yielding because they might signal strong competitive hierarchies, and thus suppressed species and preclusion to achieve transgressive over-yielding (Loreau 2000) . However, the fact that productive species over-yield disproportionately does not necessarily come at the cost of other species under-yielding. In our experiment, the patterns of relative yields of individual species suggest that dominance was not a relevant mechanism triggering SEs (see Fig. S6 ), which highlights that SEs are useful drivers of biodiversity effects and should not be overlooked in crop mixtures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 97, "text": "(Fox 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1377, "text": "(Fargione et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1673, "text": "(Loreau 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 128, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1274, "text": "Figure S4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1971, "text": "Fig. S6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Interestingly, SEs were stronger in assemblages of wild progenitors than in assemblages of crops, consistently across species and functional group richness levels. Moreover, dissimilarity in leaf areas, which were larger in mixtures of wilds, partly accounted for the lower capacity of crops to over-yield in mixtures. There is general consensus that functional differences between co-occurring species underlie the link between diversity and productivity (Cardinale et al. 2011 ). This link strengthens over time, due to adaptations through natural selection (Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) . Thus, given time, populations of diverse mixtures are expected to be better adapted to growing with interspecific partners (Dawson & Goldringer 2012) . For example, Allard & Adams 1969 found that mixtures formed by varieties of barley selected as pure lines were less productive compared to mixtures of barley lines cultivated together for many generations. This is consistent with grassland BEF experiments showing that species with a co-selection history in mixtures develop functional trait divergence and increase biodiversity effects (both complementarity and selection effects; Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) . Indeed, frequent biotic interactions have been documented to impose selection on plasticity in functional traits and result in functional divergence between neighbouring plants in experimental (Lipowsky et al. 2011 ) and natural grasslands (Abakumova et al. 2016) . Our results concur with these findings and provide evidence that crop breeding, as a selection process that generally occurs in monospecific stands, might have disrupted the ability of crops to develop strong biodiversity effects in diverse environments. These differences between crop plants and wild progenitors might arise either from directional selection in crops, or from reduced plasticity after domestication in certain traits , which remains to be investigated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 456, "end": 478, "text": "(Cardinale et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 560, "end": 591, "text": "(Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 717, "end": 743, "text": "(Dawson & Goldringer 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 759, "end": 778, "text": "Allard & Adams 1969", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1208, "text": "Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1425, "text": "(Lipowsky et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1474, "text": "(Abakumova et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In addition, arable cropping systems might pose limitations to co-evolutionary adaptations that promote complementarity (Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014 ). CEs generally increases over time (Fargione et al. 2007; Lipowsky et al. 2011; Reich 2012; Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) , which indicates co-adaptation of the genotypes at play (Zuppinger-Dingley et al. 2014) , and might facilitate transgressive over-yielding in the long term (Cardinale et al. 2007 ). Since intercrops are rarely re-seeded on-farm in arable systems, which was mirrored in our experiment by using seeds with no previous history of coexistence, such opportunities for co-adaptation are precluded. We speculate that the ability of domesticated crops to adapt to local neighbourhoods would be hampered, either because they exhibit lower genetic variation and evolutionary potential (Doebley et al. 2006; Miller & Gross 2011; Zhang et al. 2015) and/or lower potential for plasticity due to an evolutionary history of coexistence in monocultures (Abakumova et al. 2016) . In other words, mixing pure varieties that exhibit local adaptation is probably significantly advantageous in terms of monoculture yield and other ecosystem services, but not necessarily optimal for the performance in mixtures. Thus, we suggest identifying traits, or trait combinations, that make mixtures of wild progenitors more productive, and bringing back the genes underlying those phenotypes to current varieties (Zhang et al. 2015; Wuest & Niklaus 2018) . Alternatively, instead of focusing on single beneficial traits, breeding for mixing ability can be oriented to increase genetic diversity and/or plasticity within crop varieties.

Clearly, further studies addressing more crop species, and wider genetic, varietal and domestication status diversities within species, are needed. In this sense, to test if genotypes that are more closely related to their wild progenitors also show stronger biodiversity effects a set up that includes multiple stages along a sequence of domestication of a given species would be suitable (see e.g. Roucou et al., 2018) .

Since crop plants have a recent history of selection under monoculture, we argue that crop breeding might have hindered the ability of crop plants to perform in interspecific neighbourhoods through reduced genetic variance or plasticity in key traits. It will be interesting to explore to what extent the different functional divergences found within crops vs. wild mixtures arise from a directional selection of certain phenotypes or from a reduced plasticity in certain traits in crops.
