Recognition initiates a series of events through which the polysomes on which the proteins are being made are brought into intimate association with the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nascent polypeptide chains are directed to penetrate into Figure 1 . Panel I illustrates a ribosome (dotted structure) bound to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. A nascent polypeptide chain with a signal sequence (dashed line) at its N -terminus (the end that is synthesized first) is shown passing through the membrane; the C-terminus, to which amino acids are still being added, is associated with the ribosome. It is believed that the signal sequence can remain bound in the membrane, so that the nascent chain loops into the lumen (LUM) of the endoplasmic reticulum until proteolytically cleaved from the signal sequence. Cleavage can occur before the C-terminus is completed. Completed proteins can be released to the lumen (a) or, if they possess stop-transfer sequences (st) or comparable features, they can remain inserted in the membrane (b). Panels II and III illustrate two of the several other dispositions different membrane proteins assume in the endoplasmic ret iculum membrane. In panel II, the polypeptide chain is oriented with its N -terminal end facing the cytoplasm (CYT), rather than the lumen . Other proteins loop one or more times through the membrane, as schematized in panel III. the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The polysomes thus become bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure 1 ), and the nascent proteins can move, cotranslationally (as they grow), into the membrane and across it to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. During this movement, endoplasmic reticulum enzymes and other agents initiate glycosylation, folding, and other maturation of the nascent polypeptide. Import. Recognition of targeting sequences by target membranes or other systems implies that the sequences are exposed at external surfaces of the proteins, at least at crucial moments. Target membranes are presumed to possess receptorlike proteins responsible for the recognition. A few of these proteins have been tentatively identified. For example, among the putative receptors on the outer membranes of mitochondria, one protein can bind to many of the species of proteins imported by these organelles (Glick et al. 1991 , Horwich 1990 , pfanner et al. 1991 .",

This observation, plus the fact that an alphahelix 20 amino acids in length is long enough to span the width of a lipid bilayer, led at one time to models in which these hydrophobic sequences were thought to require no aid in penetrating into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. However, although processes resembling such direct penetration may occur for portions of certain membrane proteins, most investigators now believe that the passage of polypeptide chains into or across membranes generally depends on specific arrangements of membrane constituents into channels or transporter (translocator) complexes associated with the appropriate receptors (Kuchler and Thorner 1990, Simon and Blobel 1991) . The passage involves consumption of ATP and, for mitochondria and chloroplasts, requires that the organelles have transmembrane electrochemical potentials, but the precise uses of such energy is not clear. For mitochondria, one possibility is that the transmembrane potential helps trap, orient, or move the positively charged signal sequence.",

The particle remains associated until the complex of polysome, nascent chains, and signal recognition particles interacts (docks) with proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Thereupon, the ribosomes bind to the endoplasmic reticulum, the signal recognition particles are dissociated in a GTPdependent reaction, and translation resumes with the nascent chains positioned to traverse the membrane.",

Interestingly, some proteins reach the outer compartment of the mitochondrion by initially entering completely into the inner compartment and then moving back across the inner membrane.

This last explanation, however, is based largely on speculative analogies with the events through which polysomes become bound to the endoplasmic reticulum, and it cannot account for the differential localization of mRNAs in oocytes at times before translation of the messages begins.

The younger chains-yet to be completed-and their ribosomes are still attached to the membrane. It seems likely that new ribosomal subunits associate with the mRNAs held close to the endoplasmic reticulum by these attachments and initiate new translation.

Schematization of some principal routes of transport of proteins among membrane-bounded cytoplasmic compartments. Many types of proteins made on the rough (ribosome-studded) endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are transported in vesicles to sacs associated with the cis side of the Golgi apparatus (cisGA). After moving to systems located at or near the trans side of the Golgi apparatus (transGA), the proteins are sorted into vehicles that carry appropriate molecules to different sites. Vesicles of the regulated secretory pathway (regS) transport hormones and secreted enzymes for release to the extracellular space by exocytic membrane fusions with the plasma membrane (PM). Some other secretions and certain cell-surface molecules and components of extracellular matrices are among the materials carried by the constitutive secretory pathway (conS). Membranes from secretory vesicles are retrieved from the cell surface and recycle to the Golgi zone for reuse (recyc). There also is recycling from compartments associated with the cis Golgi face to the ER. Different Golgi-derived vesicles transport plasma membrane components to different domains of the cell surface; A versus B sorting schematizes differential targeting to the apical or the basal domain of epithelial cells. The diagram also illustrates the direct continuities between RER and ER lacking ribosomes (smooth ER; SER) through which the enzymatic machinery of the SER and other materials can move. The thick walls drawn for some of the Golgi-associated vesicles schematize the likely presence of special coats on their cytoplasmic surface. One forming Golgi vesicle has been drawn with spike-like projections, indicating the projections seen by electron microscopy on Golgi and endocytotic vesiclescoated with clathrin. Vesicles from the trans Golgi systems carry enzymes and other molecules to the system of endosomes (ENDOs) and lysosomes (LYSOs). This system receives diverse materials that the cell internalizes by endocytosis (EC) from the cell surface and extracellular milieu. Some endocytosed materials acquired at one cell surface region cross the cytoplasm in vesicles and are released by vesicle fusion at a different cell surface region. This route (transcytosis; TC) may involve endosomes as a way station, and it may participate in sorting of materials to apical versus basal cell surface domains. Membranes recycle from the endosome-lysosome system to the cell surface, and there also are incompletely delineated pathways from endosomes and lysosomes to Golgi-associated structures. Entry of proteins from the cytoplasm. Histones, ribosomal proteins, regulatory proteins, enzymes of nucleic acid metabolism, and proteins of invading viruses are among the proteins made in the cytoplasm that enter the nucleus. For several such proteins, nuclear localization sequences have been identified that can target proteins to the nucleus. These amino acid sequences vary in composition and location along the polypeptide chain. Some contain key stretches, approximately a halfdozen amino acids in length, that include clusters of basic amino acids. In other cases, noncontiguous amino acid clusters including basic amino acids cooperate with one another in nuclear targeting (Dingwall and Laskey 1991) .",

The directionality of net transport across the nuclear envelope-for example, histones accumulate in the nucleus and ribosomal subunits in the cytoplasm-may arise partly because molecules or particles, at their destinations, often become involved in complexes that limit their subsequent freedom of movement. On the other hand, one kinase is thought to move into the nucleus only when cyclic-AMP-mediated signals free it from binding to cytoplasmic membranes (Goldfarb 1991) . Thus, the cell allows this protein to enter the nucleus only under particular biological circumstances. Regulated movements of other proteins-hormone receptors, transcription factors, and enzymes-into the nucleus depend on phosphorylations, masking and unmasking of nuclear localization sequences, or, possibly, association with carrier proteins possessing nuclear localization sequences (e.g., Schmitz et al. 1991 , Sommer et al. 1991 .",

A number of proteins appear to shuttle with the opposite orientation, moving into and then out of the nucleus (Goldfarb 1991) . Some such proteins are putative regulatory agents. Others are postulated to be agents-perhaps including receptors for nuclear localization signals-that transport molecules into the nucleus, release them there and return to the cytoplasm to be loaded again. Carriers of this type might participate in export from the nucleus, as well as in import.

Targeting of proteins to nucleoli (Borer et al. 1989 , Garcia-Bustos et al. 1991 depends on amino acid sequences additional to the nuclear localization sequences. Some of the nucleolus-targeting sequences may simply bind the proteins to nucleolar structures, but others could have more 614 specific effects. Certain prominent nucleolar proteins are among the molecules suspected to shuttle repeatly to the cytoplasm, where they spend only a brief time before returning to the nucleolus.

According to the structural models, the direction of vesicle movement would be governed by interactions of cytoplasmic domains of molecules in the vesicles' membranes with kinesin, dynein, or other motor proteins that promote movement differentially toward one or the other end of a microtubule (Burgoyne 1991) . Upon reaching their destinations, vesicles are thought to dock by associating with membranes or cytoskeletal elements through events mediated by specific proteins, such as the synapsins, that are concentrated at nerve terminals (Kelly 1991) .

For example, in mammalian cells, targeting of many of the lysosomal acid hydrolases to lysosomes depends on the phosphorylation of mannoses in the N-linked oligosaccharides that are attached to the polypeptide chains (Holtzman 1989, Kornfeld and Mellman 1989) .Many proteins have N-linked oligosaccharides, but phosphorylation occurs selectively on the acid hydrolases, perhaps due to conformational features of the hydrolases based on the folding of regions distant from one another in their primary sequences (Baranski et al. 1991) . (This is one of the few situations in which there is detailed, strong evidence for involvement' in targeting, of a patch assembled from noncontiguous sequences in a protein; Chrispeels 1991 , Sabatini et al. 1991 .) The phosphomannoses are recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors in trans-Golgi-associated membranes. These receptors bind the hydrolases within the lumen of the trans-Golgi systems and segregate the enzymes in to cIa thrin-coated vesicles for transport to forming lysosomes.",

The best known of such mechanisms involves the pH sensitivity of ligand binding to receptors. Many of the membrane-associated receptors that transport materials to compartments with acidified interiors, such as endosomes or lysosomes, bind ligands well at neutral pH but release them at low pH (Holtzman 1989) . Thus, the ligands are freed from the membrane on delivery, but the receptors can be recruited into September 1992 vehicles that ultimately carry them back to sites where they acquire new ligands.",

For example, molecules destined for the contents of the secretion granules that mediate regulated secretion by gland cells may segregate from other materials in the trans-Golgi lumen largely by condensation (Kelly 1991, Seethaler and Huttner 1991) . That is, the secretory materials may form into their concentrated aggregates through processes resembling selective precipitation based on direct interactions of these molecules with one another rather than on clustering mediated by receptors or other outside agents. It seems likely to several investigators that such processes, regulated perhaps by pH, calciumion concentration, sulfation, and other modifications of the aggregating molecules, could sufficiently sort the granule-directed secretions from other molecules, permitting only minimal leakage of materials into the wrong compartments. How the aggregates become packaged within the membrane-delimited bodies that ultimately release the secretions from the cell still needs to be explained.",

A cell's lysosomes can break down material from the cytoplasm by classical autophagy: the sequestration and degradation of relatively large portions of cytoplasm. Through related processes, plasma membrane proteins taken into the cell during endocytosis can become internalized and digested within lysosomes rather than recycling to the cell surface or to intracellular stores. Autophagy involves both random aspects and some selectivity. Little is understood, however, about how the cell chooses cytoplasmic regions to be engulfed within autophagic lysosomes or about the controls of crinophagy, the autophagic process in which secretion granules fuse selectively with lysosomes. Degradation of endocytic membrane components may also involve random facets, like the accidental trapping of membrane in lytic bodies. But for the epidermal growth factor receptor, a specific domain with kinase activity targets the receptor protein for selective, rapid degradation induced by the growth factor (Felder et al. 1990 ).",
