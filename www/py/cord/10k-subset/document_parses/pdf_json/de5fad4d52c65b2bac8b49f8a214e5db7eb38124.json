Based on a stated method approach, we analyze the attitude that the French would adopt if this measure were put in place. Next, we propose a cost-benefit analysis to discuss the cost-effectiveness of this measure. We find that over three-quarters of respondents report complying with home confinement. Their choice depends on their individual characteristics, the interaction they may have with an infected person and home confinement conditions, but not their experience with preventive measures. We find that behaviors such as sensitivity to certainty, selfishness and altruism emerge. As far as cost-effectiveness is concerned, our study shows that home confinement is a prevention path that should not be neglected and should even be prescribed.",

Spanish flu (1918) (1919) (1920) , Asian flu (1957) (1958) , Hong Kong flu (1968) (1969) , Russian flu (1977) (1978) , H 1 N 1 flu pandemic (2009) (2010) and avian influenza A (H 7 N 9 ) virus (2013) are examples. 1 These epidemics have a high speed of propagation that generates many victims. The 2009 H 1 N 1 epidemic highlighted the importance of the use of home confinement 2 on a large scale to fight against emerging diseases. In March 2009, an influenza pandemic H 1 N 1 emerged in Mexico. Since 1 st August 2010, more than 214 countries have been affected by this epidemic, which has claimed over 18,449 deaths. 3 As a vaccine has not yet been produced, only non-pharmaceutical interventions have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [32] . One of them is home confinement. Many countries have applied it on a voluntary basis, while others like China have imposed it [20] .",

            "text": "Our approach is based on two building blocks. First, we contribute to the literature in epidemiology by studying perceptions and individual behavior in the face of a home confinement policy to prevent the influenza epidemics. Understanding people's behavior is necessary to define health policy. Indeed, as discussed in [37] , individual behavior within society determines the impact of the epidemic. An individual who does not want to comply with preventive measures would become more and more dangerous to themselves and the rest of society. Therefore, it is necessary to determine in advance individual reactions when deciding on public health policy. The literature lacks data on how individuals will behave in the face of a home confinement policy during an influenza epidemic. This article is the first to fill this gap. We use a stated preference method. Kroes and Sheldon [19] and Louviere et al. [22] present and develop the use of this method in diverse fields. We then conduct a questionnaire to elicit the preferences of individuals. In the questionnaire, we place respondents in a hypothetical context in which an epidemic has been reported. We put them in different situations: first, they have been in contact with at least one infected person; second, they have been in contact with at least one infected person and medical assistance is provided during home confinement; third, they have not been in contact with infected persons. For each situation, we ask them to choose the maximum number of days they will be willing to stay at home. In fact, asking for the number of days, as opposed to asking directly whether the respondent would comply with home confinement is a way to evaluate the duration that the respondents would voluntarily be willing to stay at home by removing the efficiency aspect of the sanitary measure. Thus, it avoids a deviation of behavior if this measure was to be applied in case of epidemics. From respondents' answers, we elicit the proportion of respondents who are willing to comply with home confinement, which is people who have answered a number of days equal to or higher than 7 days. We find that more than three-quarters of respondents would comply with home confinement. Deciding to be willing to comply with home confinement during an influenza epidemic depends on an individual's characteristics (age, income, composition of the household and professional group), the interaction one can have with an infected person (meeting or not), and the conditions of home confinement (medical assistance or not), but not on having real experience of preventive measures. We discuss the different behaviors that emerge from this study, such as sensitivity to certainty, egoism and altruism.",

However, [2] is the only study that estimated the cost of influenza in France, but its evaluation only concerned the impact on influenza spread of school and public transport closure policies. Focusing on the economic impact of the home confinement policy on influenza is therefore new in economic literature. We try to recognize, identify, evaluate, measure and value the costs of influenza and home confinement in France. We use detailed data on the prevalence, the incidence of the disease and the incidence rate from the French GPs Sentinelles network. 5 These data have the particularity of proposing age groups (children, adults and the elderly), which is very useful given that influenza does not affect people in the same way according to age. However, building a mathematical model on the reduction of the influenza incidence with a home confinement policy in force is difficult largely because of the small amount of occurrences in France and therefore the shortage of data. Because of the difficulties in calculating realistic estimates of the reduction of influenza incidence due to home confinement, we focus on the incidence reduction threshold from which home confinement is cost-effective. We find that the measure of home confinement would be a prevention track not to be dismissed. By comparing our results with the existing literature (Longini et al. [21] , and Haber et al. [13] , which have done stochastic simulation models of influenza epidemics in other countries) and the stated method approach, we see that this measure would be cost-effective.",

The principal symptoms of influenza are fever, chills, cough, headaches, diarrhea, sore throat, runny nose, body aches and fatigue. The affected individuals become contagious 1 day before the onset of the first symptoms and remain so for 5 days. Symptoms appear 1-3 days after contamination. The influenza usually lasts 1 week. 6 In France, influenza affects between 1 and 4 million people each year and causes between 1500 and 2000 deaths, mainly among people over 65 years. 7 Influenza viruses are easily transmitted from person to person by air. In the event of a reported epidemic, personal protective measures, such as wearing a mask, are recommended to avoid being infected or infecting others. For influenza, vaccines exist. but immunity is not acquired following vaccination. Moreover, the constant genetic changes in influenza viruses require that the composition of the vaccine be adjusted every year. Indeed, the vaccine for influenza has a low efficacy due to the variability of influenza strains. WHO decides in February on the composition of the vaccine to be used in the October vaccination campaign. Then, the vaccine is manufactured according to the circulating strains, but some strains can mutate. This is what happened in France during the winter 2014-2015, when the flu caused over 18,000 deaths among people who had been vaccinated against flu.",

This method allows us to analyze the choices stated by individuals to express individual behavior in relation to a given situation. A questionnaire has been drawn up in which, as an introduction to the respondent, we explain that home confinement consists of staying at home with contact only with the members of one's household and the the characteristics of pandemic flu (symptoms, duration...). We then place the respondent in a hypothetical situation in which an epidemic has been reported and they have been in contact with an infected person (CH Contact). We then ask them to choose the maximum number of days they will be willing to confine themselves to home, i.e., staying at home without outside contact. We ask them the same question by adding the intervention of medical assistance, which is the visit of a health-care professional who verifies the state of health of the respondent during home confinement (CH HWV). This situation allows us to highlight the effect of medical follow-up. We then ask them the same question one last time, modifying the initial situation by the fact that they have not been in contact with the infected persons (CH No contact). This situation allows us to analyze the impact of the risk of contamination on the decision of the respondent. In fact, asking for the number of days, not directly whether the respondent would comply with home confinement, that is, staying home for 7 days, is a way to avoid the anchorage bias. This makes it possible to evaluate the duration that respondents would voluntarily be willing to stay at home by removing the efficiency aspect of the sanitary measure. Thus, it avoids a deviation of behavior if this measure was to be applied in case of epidemics. Finally, we complete the questionnaire with control questions over respondents' gender, age, income, family composition, professional group and whether they have already experienced preventive measures during periods of epidemics.",

We then study the Figure 1 presents the proportion of people who are willing to comply with home confinement, which is people who have answered a number of days equal to or higher than 7 days. Each situation, that is to say having been in contact with an infected person (CH Contact), having been in contact with an infected person and having the visit of a health professional during home confinement (CH HWV), and not having been in contact with an infected person (CH No contact), is shown. We first observe that over three-quarters of respondents indicate compliance with home confinement. The elderly are more willing to comply with confinement than adults. We observe that the respondents' decisions are different according to the situations. Indeed, more adults indicate compliance with home confinement when a health professional visits them during home confinement. Medical assistance is the assurance to be taken care of in case of development of the disease. Having a medical follow-up can reassure the respondents about the conditions of their confinement and therefore create an incentive to comply. Moreover, more elderly persons indicate compliance with home confinement when they have not been in contact with a contaminated person. The elderly verify the certainty effect of [16] . They prefer to eliminate risk rather than reduce it. The elderly are sensitive to certainty. Finally, selfish behavior by respondents is highlighted. Altruistic behavior would mean that an individual who is more likely to become contaminated, and thereby contaminate others, decides to confine themselves to their home to avoid contact with others. In our study, being in contact with an infected person makes respondents (adults and elderly) less likely to confine than not to be in contact. Thus, if the individual risk of being contaminated and therefore of contaminating others is higher, the proportion of respondents in agreement with confinement is lower. This indicates selfish behavior on the part of the respondents.",

            "text": "We note that according to age, different costs are considered and their value differs. For children, the cost is divided between a medical cost (otitis media, pneumonia, hospitalization), the loss of human capital, the loss of parent productivity and the death of children cost. The medical cost is the lowest because the probability that influenza degenerates into otitis media and pneumonia is low. However, the loss of human capital represents a high cost. 17 We take the same assumptions as [2] , but we update the results with more recent data. We assume that sick children miss school for 3 days implying a reduction of about 0.8 percent of their human capital in that year. We assume a return to schooling of 5 percent per year. The net present value of earnings over the life cycle (42 years) is calculated with an annual discount factor equal to 0.95. We consider individuals to live 15 years in retirement. This yields a loss of 92.88 euros per influenza episode. As a child cannot supervise himself, an adult (most often the mother) has to be at home during their illness. This creates a loss of productivity based on the median female income, weighted by the labor market participation of women. This induces a large cost of 95.70 euros. We then use the value of a statistical life (VSL) which quantifies the benefit for the society of avoiding a fatality. Empirical literature evaluates the VSL between 1.3 and 7.5 18 For adults, we consider that on average an adult infected by influenza does not go to work during 2 days. This implies a loss of productivity due to their absence from work of ca. 74 euros, and an additional loss of productivity when they work at 50 percent of their capacity, around 12.96 euros. For evaluating the cost of death, we adopt the same method as for the children. We get a low risk of death around 4.82 per 100,000. Then, we add medical costs for GP visit and hospitalization. These costs represent a small expenditure compared to the overall cost. 19 Finally, the costs for the elderly are divided between the medical cost and the cost of death. Medical cost is much higher than for children and adults, at 695 euros. Moreover, the probability of death is large, 205.19 per 100,000, implying a large cost of death. 20 Then, we estimate the cost of home confinement in France. Research on the cost-benefit analysis of prevention measures for infectious diseases has considered different types of cost measures including costs Table 5 Costs of influenza per case, in euro Data on costs and health-care use are taken from [33] for children, from [31] for adults and from [27] for the elderly. These studies weight medical costs by the probability of health-care usage. Data on mortality from influenza by age group comes from the National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol 65, No 4, June 2016. We have taken the average rate of mortality from 2005 to 2014 by age group. Data on wages are taken from INSEE, \"Revenus salariaux m\u00e9dians des salari\u00e9s de 25 \u00e0 55 ans selon le sexe en 2014\" (http://www. insee .fr/fr/theme s/table au.asp?regid =0&refid =NATno n0414 6). Labor market participation data come from OECD skill data set. All US dollars are converted into euros with an exchange rate of 0.8. Loss of human capital is costed using a return to schooling of 5 percent, median wages by sex and average labor market participation by sex over a period of 42 years. Net present value numbers are displayed and calculated with a discount factor equal to 0.95. to society, costs to individuals [8] , quality-of-life measures [30] , etc. In general, costs can be divided into direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are all expenditures for continuing care, health-care providers, certain household expenditures (meal and delivery, home energy), hospitalization and personal wage employed for the sanitary measures. Indirect cost is the productivity loss cost due to the absence of the individual to work, the productivity loss cost due to the closure or the lack of frequentation of a public place and the cost of death. We try to recognize, identify, list, measure and value these costs in Table 6 . Table 6 displays the costs of home confinement. We have considered the same age group as for the costs of influenza. We take as a reference the age of the infected person. As home confinement concerns all household members including the infected person, we have evaluated the costs for the entire household according to INSEE (2013 INSEE ( -2014 . To calculate the costs of a representative household, we have used the weight that each household composition represents in France from INSEE (2013-2014).",

For evaluating the incidence and the prevalence of influenza in France, we use the French GPs Sentinelles network, which compiles of large databases on disease prevalence, incidence and incidence rate in France. This network is made up of 1300 general practitioners (2.2% of all practitioners in France) and about a 100 voluntary, liberal pediatricians. The member physicians are called \"Sentinel physicians\". 22 In 2017, the network continuously collected information on eight health indicators (seven infectious diseases and one non-infectious indicator). 23 The Institut de Veille Sanitaire (lnVS) implemented this network as a public health surveillance system in 1984. Figure 2 displays the time series patterns of incidence rates at the national level and on a weekly basis between 2005 and 2014. 24 Each year, we observe recurrent peak of influenza during the winter season. However, the amplitude of these peaks varies little. It does not appear to diminish or increase over time. Figure 3 displays the average incidence rates within a year, by calendar month, from January to December. As seen in the previous graph, influenza shows strong seasonal patterns with a peak in winter (in February) and a low incidence between mid-spring and mid-fall (from May to August).

Building a mathematical model on the reduction of the influenza incidence with home confinement prevention in France is difficult largely because of the very few occurred cases in France and therefore the shortage of data. 27 In fact, only two cases occurred when at the end of December 2016, residents (66 people) of a retirement home in Moselle (Northeast France) and a retirement home (80 people) in Saint-Gengoux-le-National (Center-East France) were confined to reduce the spread of influenza. Because of the difficulties in calculating realistic estimates of the rate reduction in the incidence due to home confinement, we propose to evaluate the rate reduction threshold in the incidence due to home confinement for which the home confinement policy is cost-effective. We then calculate this threshold, 1 \u2212 r Conf when all the age class are differentiated, and 1 \u2212 r All Conf for all aggregated population, such that C Conf = C Influ and C i Conf = C i Influ , respectively. We consider two options for home confinement: without medical assistance (Without HWV) and with medical assistance (With HWV). Table 8 presents the results according to the VSL value and the proportion (in percentage) of individuals complying with home confinement.",

Therefore, based on cost-benefit analysis, to implement home confinement, health decisionmakers will be more inclined to be less demanding about the level of reduction in the impact of this measure when the benefit to society of avoiding death is high. On the other hand, the more the measure is respected by more individuals, the more the level of reduction required will be high. We then observe that the increased costs of the measure linked to the medical assistance during home confinement must be offset by an increase in the rate of incidence reduction for the measure to be cost-effective. Finally, we note that the rate reduction threshold of incidence is higher when we differentiate age class than when we consider the aggregated population. Thus, by not differentiating by age classes, the public decision-maker may consider that the measure is costeffective, whereas it is not when differentiation is taken into account. This shows the interest of considering age classes in a study on influenza epidemics.",

The rate reduction threshold of incidence varies 28 That is, 70% of those infected and their household members agreed to stay confined to home while 30% refused. 29 The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is one of the commonly accepted measures of pandemic severity. R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary infections, produced by a typical infected case in a very susceptible population. From [10, 25, 35] , R 0 values for influenza range between 1.4 and 3.9, where R 0 \u2264 1.8 are considered as of low transmissibility and 2.2 \u2264 R 0 \u2264 3.9 as of high transmissibility. These studies have been done in Southeast Asia, for reproducing the 1918 pandemic influenza around the world, and in Florida (USA), respectively. between 65.88 and 84.13% with differentiated age classes, and between 49.24 and 65.05% with the aggregated population. According to the existing studies carried out in other countries, we observe that a 10% increase in the proportion of people who comply with home confinement strongly increases the incidence reduction rate. For instance, from [13] , when 70% of people comply with the measure, the reduction rate is 83% while it is 91% with 80% of people complying. In our stated approach, we find that the level of home confinement stated by respondents is between 75.90 and 94.44%.

However, having real experience of preventive measures does not factor significantly in the decision to comply or not. Moreover, we highlight selfish behavior by respondents. When they are more likely to become contaminated and thereby contaminate others, they are less willing to comply with home confinement. However, this behavior may also be explained by a certainty bias that pushes people to believe that they are taking all necessary measures to avoid contamination. Finally, we also observe that respondents may behave altruistically when dealing with their own family. Indeed, not staying home during an epidemic limits the risk of contamination of next of kin, especially in large families.",

Indeed, our study can easily be replicated in other regions or countries.Our paper has certain limitations. First, as in all preference approaches, there may be hypothetical biases and controversies or incorrect messages leading to confusion or misunderstanding by participants in our study. As suggested by [23] , we tried to reduce the hypothetical bias by using \"cheap talk\" 30 to explain the home confinement policy and the characteristics of pandemic flu (symptoms, duration...) before asking the first question to respondents. Second, the data collection method could be discussed. We used an online study. Online studies save time and effort in collecting data [7, 9, 24] and provide better quality responses with fewer \"Do not know\" answers [11, 15, 18] . Therefore, as far as the quality of the collected data is concerned, online studies do not seem to present more disadvantages than other types of surveys.",
