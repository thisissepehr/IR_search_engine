It is found that the time of the epidemic outbreak depends mainly on the mobility rate of the individuals in this model. We have also derived a critical value with respect to the mobility rate.

            "text": "Epidemic spreading, including the spreading of human diseases, rumors, and computer viruses, has been one of the most prolific fields in complex network dynamics. 1, 2 Large research effort has recently been devoted to the study of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model, where each vertex belongs to one of two states, either susceptible or infected. 3 Mathematical analysis on such model has revealed the importance of topology for propagation dynamics, such as lack of an epidemic threshold on scalefree networks. 4, 5 These studies assumed the network evolves more slowly than the diffusion process. The system can be modeled as a static network basing on this assumption, which is effective in many circumstances, such as the spread of the computer viruses, traffic dynamics, and the propagation of some diseases which spread rapidly. However, the propagation of many infectious diseases has comparable time scale as fluctuation of the networks topology, such as tuberculosis, foot and mouth disease among cattle, and various sexually transmitted infections. [6] [7] [8] [9] In recent years, there have been extensive research activities on time-varying networks, or called temporal networks, which evolve on a time scale comparable to the time scale of the propagation process. [10] [11] [12] An additional time dimension is considered in time-varying networks. At every time step, an instance of a time-varying network is formed. All these network instances for many time steps can be aggregated to a static network. An excellent overview of the various applications of temporal networks in many disciplines can be found in Ref. 10 . More recently, Hoppe et al. have investigated mutual selection in time-varying networks. 11 Kotnis et al. found the existence of an \"adaptive threshold,\" on adaptive time-varying networks. 12 Gong et al. have investigated the time-varying human mobility patterns with metapopulation epidemic dynamics. 13 Starnini et al. have investigated the immunization strategies for epidemic processes in time-varying contact networks. 14 All these investigations indicate that time-varying networks play an important role in the investigation of the epidemic spreading that occurs on complex networks.",

We call q, r, and T as the mobility rate, the connected rate, and the mobility period, respectively. Now we analyze the static community network, which aggregates all instances formed in the T \u00fe 1 time steps.

However, if the mobility rate is enough high, the epidemic can spread into the second community before it die, and the epidemic can also survive in the first community because of the infected individuals jumping from the second community to the first community. For checking this idea, let us perform experiments. We structure the time-varying networks with the same parameters as used in Fig. 2 , but k \u00bc 0:005, which is larger than k 2 c \u00bc 0:0018 and is smaller than k 1 c \u00bc 0:0061. And we set the initial number of infected individuals x\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 100, which is randomly chosen in the first community. So we can calculate q 1 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc x\u00f00\u00de=n 1 \u00bc 0:125, q 2 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0, and q\u00f00\u00de \u00bc x\u00f00\u00de=N \u00bc 0:05, where q 1 \u00f00\u00de, q 2 \u00f00\u00de, and q\u00f00\u00de represent the density of infected individual in the first community, second community, and total network, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the evolution process of q\u00f0t\u00de in two communities. The black asterisks represent the density of infected individuals in the first community as a function of time and the red circles represent evolution of infected individuals in the second community. Obviously, as shown in Fig. 4(a) , the epidemic outbreaks at t \u00bc 60 approximately for q \u00bc 0.008 in the second community and also survives in the first community, although the number of infected individuals is quite low in the first community. However, for q \u00bc 0.001, the number of infected individuals is reduced gradually to zero in the first community and the epidemic do not outbreak all along in the second community, which can be seen from Fig. 4(b) . Now let us analyze theoretically how the mobility rate influences epidemic spreading in this case. Duo to k < k 1 c , there exists a time step t 1 , the epidemic will die when t \u00bc t 1 in the first community. The epidemic can survive only if the infected individuals can move into the second community and at least one susceptible individual in the second community is infected before t \u00bc t 1 . First, we calculate t 1 . According to Eq. (6), q 1 \u00f0t\u00de is reduced gradually to be close to zero when a < 0. So we can set q 1 \u00f0t 1 \u00de a very small number. Here, we set q 1 \u00f0t 1 \u00de \u00bc 0:0001 and solving Eq. (6) we get",
