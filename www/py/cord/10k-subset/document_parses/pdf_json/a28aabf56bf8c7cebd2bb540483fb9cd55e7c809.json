Our laboratory has focused on the use of recombinant nonhuman primate cytokines as adjunctive therapies for inducing antigen-specific immune responses in monkeys because most recombinant human cytokines appear to be immunogenic.

Much of the progress on this issue, in fact, has been facilitated by our ability to sequence in some cases the complete genome of an infectious agent; by the global threats posed by agents such as HIV; and by our insights on the mechanisms by which vaccines can induce their protective effect, a scientific knowledge database that continues to grow. An \"ideal\" vaccine is considered a formulation that, following administration, does not cause side effects, is easy to administer, is highly immunogenic, and provides readily measurable protective and long-lasting immunity. No vaccine to date meets all these criteria, some of which appear to oppose each other (e.g., safety vs efficacy). Hence, this has led to the use of adjunctive agents that attempt to fulfill some of the criteria that are missing in the candidate vaccine.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Vaccines have traditionally involved the use of either live and/or attenuated organisms, (polio-Sabin, measles, mumps, rubella, yellow fever, varicella, rotavirus, BCG), killed forms of the entire organism (polio-Salk, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, hepatitis A, pertussis, cholera, typhoid), subunit vaccines (Hepatitis B, H. influenza B, pneumococci, meningococci, pertussis, anthrax), or in the form toxoids (diptheria, tetanus). More recently, there has been considerable interest in the use of peptide-based vaccines, vectored vaccines, and nucleic acid-(DNA) based vaccines. To a great extent, except for the last three categories (which are for select candidate vaccines at various stages of the Phase I, II, or III clinical trials), in the case of many infectious disease agents, the previously utilized strategies have been quite effective. Fairly recently, there also has been an interest in genetic approaches to developing safe but live attenuated vaccines, such as; (1) the use of introducing mutations within the coding region (missense mutations in the case of RSV and insertion/mutations in the cases of pox viruses, and dengue), (2) deletion mutants (herpes simplex virus; HSV), and (3) antigenic chimeric viruses such as rotavirus vaccines. In general, the most effective protective immune response appears to be conferred by live/attenuated vaccines, followed by whole killed organisms, recombinant proteins, and, lastly, antigenic peptides. With the objective to induce longer-lasting immunity coupled with a growing concern for safety, there has been considerable interest in the use of recombinant and subunit protein preparations and native or DNA vector-based immunizations. To date the recombinant DNA-based delivery systems have included both bacterial (Listeria, mycobacteria, salmonella, shigella) and viral vectors (adenoviruses, alphaviruses, lentiviruses, and poxviruses). These strategies also serve the purpose of being able to perform well-designed basic and clinical protocols because the immunogens are highly characterized (with knowledge of the precise sequence), permitting an objective evaluation of the immune response and its correlation with protection. A large body of literature attests to the feasibility and efficacy of several such strategies in small-animal models. Unfortunately, to a large extent, such formulations are poorly immunogenic by themselves in preclinical models (e.g., primates) and in humans and have to be incorporated with some form of adjuvant. This has generated a new branch of science of adjuvant research in the field of vaccinology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The list of adjuvants that have been utilized (and the list keeps growing) include: (1) aluminum salts; (2) emulsification of the immunogen in oils; (3) ISCOMS and liposomes to encapsulate the antigen; (4) CpG containing oligodinucleotides; (5) antigen polymerization; (6) cholera toxin B; (7) C3d; (8) targeting of immunogens to dendritic cells Ansari et al. 2 (DCs); (9) use of heat-shock proteins (hsps) as carriers; and (10) the co-administration of the immunogens with cytokines, chemokines, and/or soluble or membrane bound co-stimulatory molecules (1, 2) . Cytokines and chemokines seemed to us to be the most attractive candidates to be utilized as adjuvants because these are natural cellular products and have the least likelihood of immunogenicity and toxicity to the host. Thus, our laboratory has studied the use of cytokines as adjuncts for the past decade. The purpose of this article is to summarize our findings to date and to highlight the important and, in some cases, surprising results that have been obtained so far. These studies have been conducted utilizing the nonhuman primate model of human AIDS, not only because the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)infected rhesus macaques develop most or all of the characteristics noted in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected humans (3), but also because we believe and provide data to support the notion that such cytokine-and chemokine-based therapies need to be performed in animal models and preferably nonhuman primates (owing to their similarity to humans) prior to their use in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 360, "end": 361, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 555, "end": 558, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 559, "end": 561, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Because our interests were to use cytokines as adjuvants in nonhuman primates, we first attempted to clone and sequence the nonhuman primate homologs of human cytokines and since, then have also cloned and sequenced a variety of other immunologically relevant nonhuman primate molecules (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 290, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cloning and Sequencing of Nonhuman Primate Cytokines"}, {"text": "To a great extent, the nonhuman primate cytokine sequences were highly similar to the human homologs, sharing from 93-99% homology at the nucleic acid and protein level. In addition, several of the commercially avail-able antisera against human cytokine-/chemokines and their natural ligands appeared to show good cross-reactivity with the nonhuman primate homologs (7) (8) (9) (10) . The most notable differences in the sequences were noted for interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12\u03b2 (7). We were surprised by the finding that although recombinant human cytokines functioned quite well with the use of nonhuman primate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, they were to varying degrees immunogenic in vivo. Table 1 summarizes our findings with the use of human cytokines in rhesus macaques in vivo. As seen, recombinant human IL-12 was highly immunogenic when administered to rhesus macaques, inducing an antibody response in five of six monkeys by Nonhuman Primate Cytokines 3 a Groups of monkeys were administered 10 \u00b5g of each of the cytokine intravenously at 2-wk intervals and blood samples were obtained just prior to re-administration. Serum from the monkeys were then analyzed by EIA, Western blot, and in a bioassay specific for each cytokine (7, 9) as described elsewhere (22) . two immunizations and all six monkeys by the third immunization. In each case, the antibody induced was effective in neutralizing the bioactivity of human recombinant IL-12 (data not shown). In order of relative potency, human recombinant IL-15 was next, followed by recombinant human IFN-\u03b3, and finally recombinant human IL-2. Most of the sera from the IL-15-administered monkeys were also neutralizing, whereas only two-thirds and one-third sera from the recombinant human IFN-\u03b3-and IL-2-administered monkeys, respectively, were found to be neutralizing for bioactivity of the appropriate cytokine. Preliminary data with the use of recombinant human IL-7, Flt-3L, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administration to rhesus macaques has also shown evidence of immunogenicity. Thus, in general, most recombinant human cytokines appear immunogenic in rhesus macaques, which precludes their use in vivo, at least when it is utilized on a chronic basis. However, we need to distinguish such response from potentially \"regulatory\" antibody responses that have been documented, in the homologous host (11) . These findings prompted our laboratory to embark on the arduous task of preparing recombinant rhesus macaque cytokines and chemokines, an area of research that continues to date (see also www. emory.edu/ PATHOL-OGY/ Villinger/index.htm).

Findings from initial studies utilizing recombinant human IL-12 in rhesus macaques infected with the malaria parasite initiated our interest in the use of recombinant IL-12. Thus, the monkeys administered a single dose of 10 \u00b5g/kg of recombinant human IL-12 2 d before challenge with Plasmodium cynomolgi led to the protection of seven out of seven rhesus macaques from progression of the infection to the liver stage (15) . The rationale for the use of recombinant rhesus (henceforth referred to as rMamu-IL-12) in SIV-infected rhesus macaques was strengthened by the finding that the in vitro and in vivo response of PBMCs from SIV-infected rhesus macaques to rMamu-IL-12 are gradually lost postinfection (16) as well as the early recognition by Gazzinelli et al. that IL-12 was able to prevent murine AIDS (17) . Thus, studies were conducted with our laboratory preparation of rMamu-IL-12 both in our laboratory and in collaboration with several other laboratories. We first conducted a careful dose-response study. Groups of monkeys (n = 3) were administered either 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10, or 20 \u00b5g/kg subQ and the levels of plasma IFN-\u03b3 monitored (15, 16) . This initial study showed that 10 \u00b5g/Kg was optimal for the induction of IFN-\u03b3 without any demonstrable toxicity (liver enzyme tests, complete hematology work-up, urine neopterin, etc.). Subsequently, groups of three monkeys each were administered either daily, q2, q3, q4, q5, or q7 d of rMamu-IL-12 subQ and the plasma levels of IFN-\u03b3 determined by EIA. As seen in Fig. 1A , monkeys given rMamu-IL-12 daily or every other day responded with only a single initial peak of IFN-\u03b3 production, despite continuous IL-12 administration, suggesting that they became refractory as early as d 3 in their IFN-\u03b3 response. Monkeys given IL-12 q3 and q4 days also demonstrated degrees of refractoriness, although successive IFN-\u03b3 serum peaks were detected after all or most IL-12 adminis- Ansari et al. trations. Monkeys that were given IL-12 q5 or q7 d appeared to respond by synthesizing IFN-\u03b3 to equivalent serum levels after each administration. One interpretation of this data was that perhaps the failure to detect IFN-\u03b3 was owing to the complexing of IFN-\u03b3 to the IFN-\u03b3R. As illustrated in Fig. 1B , such mechanism may have accounted, at least in part, for the decreased detection of serum IFN-\u03b3, because soluble IFN-\u03b3R was detected in the sera of daily, q2, and to a lesser extent q3 d IL-12 treated monkeys. However, of further interest was the finding that PBMCs from the daily-dosed animals during the refractory period remained truly refractory in vitro, because their culture with IL-12 did not lead to the synthesis of IFN-\u03b3 that was readily synthesized by PBMCs from animals given IL-12 q5 or q7 d. These findings prompted us to investigate the mechanisms of refractoriness Nonhuman Primate Cytokines 5 Fig. 1 .

Aliquots of PBMCs from the daily IL-12-administered monkeys as compared to PBMCs from q5 and q7 IL-12-administered monkeys as well as controls were incubated in vitro with varying amounts of rMamu-IL-12 and the levels of STAT4 mRNA were quantitated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Surprisingly, no major differences in the levels of STAT4 mRNA were noted among the various PBMCs. However, the findings by Wang et al. (19, 20) suggest that such IL-12-induced refractoriness is primarily owing to the rapid degradation of STAT4 protein required for IFN-\u03b3 transcription. It is likely that this is precisely the reason for the downregulation of IFN-\u03b3 in the monkeys that were chronically administered rMamu-IL-12. These findings prompted us to devise methods for the monitoring of PBMCs for their potential to respond to rMamu-IL-12 in vivo.

Rhesus macaques were adminis-tered DNA prime (in a VecB7 vector containing the SIV smH4 gag, rev, env, and nef proteins along with the p70 rMamu-IL-12 and the rMamu-GM-CSF expression vectors) and similar DNA boosts at wk 0, 13, and 26, followed by a virus-like particles (VLP) booster dose at wk 39 with or without rMamu IL-12 protein. All monkeys were challenged intrarectally with the pathogenic SIVsmE660 at 2 mo following the protein boost. All except one immunized monkey were infected. Details of the results of this study are published elsewhere (25) , however, the addition of IL-12 to either the DNA prime or the protein VLP boost resulted in marked decrease in viral-load set-points as compared to monkeys administered nonadjuvanted DNA prime/VLP boost or control nonimmunized monkeys. These findings further support the use of IL-12 as an adjunct for HIV-infected patients. Although rMamu-IL-12 along with rMamu-GM-CSF (as DNA prime only) did show beneficial effects in these SIV studies, the administration of rMamu-GM-CSF DNA plasmid as an adjuvant for immune responses against the malaria merozoite surface protein (MSP) in rhesus macaques showed only marginal enhancement of proliferative responses (26) . The reasons for this failure are not readily apparent at present, but suggest that the marked enhancement of immune response by the use of GM-CSF-expressing DNA in murine models (27) does not translate well to larger outbred models or to humans. This may be secondary to a number of factors that are only recently being recognized, such as expression levels relative to the weight of the host, timing of cytokine delivery relative to the antigen (28), influence of species-specific CpG in the DNA constructs, and so on. However, studies of vaccine initiatives in rhesus macaques against SIV by immunization, which include GM-CSF-expressing constructs, do show that the inclusion of GM-CSF Nonhuman Primate Cytokines influences the quality of the antilentivirus humoral response (29). Further studies need to be performed in rhesus macaques to formally address this issue, because GM-CSF either alone or in combination with additional immune factors may be able to mobilize and mature dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 774, "end": 778, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1439, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1624, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Use of rMamu-IL-12 as an Adjuvant in a Plasmid Form"}, {"text": "Augmentation of Immune Response Using rMamu-IL-2 or rMamu-IL-4", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Use of rMamu-IL-12 as an Adjuvant in a Plasmid Form"}, {"text": "The immune response of rhesus macaques that were recipients of targeted subQ regional lymph-node immunization with recombinant SIV g120 and p27 in alum and absorbed rGM-CSF with and without co-administration with either rMamu-IL-2 or rMamu-IL-4 was studied by Dr. Tom Lehner in collaboration with our lab.

The doses and schedule of cytokine administration utilized in these studies were basically empirical. It was deemed important, therefore, to conduct careful studies to determine the dosage and the schedule of cytokine administration that will induce maximal primary immune responses and to sustain long-term antigenspecific memory immune responses (31) . In a preliminary set of experiments, our lab demonstrated that 5 \u00b5g/kg and 10 \u00b5g/kg of Ansari et al. IL-2 and -15, respectively, appeared to reach a plateau in the maximal recruitment of CD4 + T cell mobilized in vivo (32) . This dose is very similar to the low IL-2 doses used in the clinical setting (33, 34) . However, side by side comparison of IL-2 and IL-15 for the mobilization of NK cells showed a better enhancement in monkeys treated with the optimized IL-2 vs IL-15 doses (Fig. 5 ). Next, we tested and compared IL-2 vs IL-15 in the enhancement of antigen-specific responses in rhesus macaques. It was reasoned that the use of tetanus toxoid to study CD4 + T cell responses and influenza virus to study CD8 + T cell responses would be one valid approach, circumventing the confounding influence of lentivirus-induced immunosuppression. Thus, groups of healthy rhesus macaques were immunized with tetanus toxoid or flu virus and administered rMamu-IL-2 or rMamu-IL-15 daily, every 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 d. The results of this study clearly indicated that the daily IL-2 administration schedule currently in clinical practice as well as IL-15 administration leads to a rapid expansion of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 effectors postimmunization, but did not appear to induce increases in long-term CD4 or CD8 memory T cells (32) . Only when administration was spaced by 3-5 d was significant enhancement of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells noted with IL-15 and also IL-2 with optima of q3-q5 d for CD4 responses, q3 for IL-2-enhanced CD8 responses, and q5 for IL-15-enhanced CD8 responses (32) . Based on these data, we tested the effect of either cytokine on the development of antigen-specific effectors and memory cells after a primary and after a secondary immunization. The study used groups of four macaques each administered a single dose of tetanus toxoid and live influenza immunization (as Nonhuman Primate Cytokines 13 Fig. 6 . Groups of four monkeys were either immunized with live attenuated influenza virus intranasally or with tetanus toxoid in Freund's incomplete adjuvant administered subQ and then treated with saline (flu only, TT only), with rMamu-IL-2, rMamu-IL-15, or both rMamu-IL-2 and rMamu-IL-15 for a period of 4 wk. PBMC samples were then evaluated for levels of IFN-\u03b3 synthesizing cells in the case of flu or IL-2 synthesizing cells in the case of tetanus toxoid using the standard ELISPOT assay. Primary responses were measured after 4 wk of therapy, the memory responses were measured at 6 mo postimmunization/cytokine therapy, and the postboost samples represent the same monkeys that were administered the same dose of antigen and the same 4 wk of cytokine therapy as during the primary immunization and 4 following cytokine therapy their PBMC samples evaluated (post boost). described earlier) followed by a 4-wk course of twice a week cytokine administration. Detailed results are presented elsewhere (32) but have been summarized in Fig. 6 . Thus, although both cytokines appear to enhance CD4-and CD8-specific primary effector responses, IL-2 was more potent and the IL-2/15 combination even better at enhancing CD8 effectors. However, memory CD8 responses in the IL-2 group were no different from the immunized but cytokine na\u00efve group, whereas IL-15-and IL-2/15-treated monkeys showed statistically elevated memory responses over untreated and IL-2treated monkeys. The various groups of monkeys were then administered a second immunization with tetanus toxoid and live attenuated Influenza virus followed by a cytokine treatment identical to the first for each individual monkey. Whereas all CD4 responses appeared boosted and enhanced by the IL-2, IL-15, or IL-2/15 combined administration, the CD8-specific responses diverged widely among the various groups. Thus, levels of flu-specific CD8 memory T cells did not significantly differ in monkeys administered IL-2 postboost from noncytokinetreated monkeys. In contrast, monkeys administered IL-15 postboost demonstrated marked enhancement of memory CD8 cells, but, to our surprise, monkeys administered the combined IL-2/15 cytokine exhibited only marginal boosting of memory CD8 T cells, suggesting that addition of IL-2 limited the IL-15-mediated enhancement (Fig. 6) . At the very least, these findings suggest complex regulatory mechanisms of T cell homeostasis in vivo using these T cell stimulatory factors, although our nonhuman primate data was recently confirmed by Oh et al. in mice (35) .

To our surprise, only a few animals ever responded with IFN-\u03b3 secretion in vivo, even though the E. coli-produced rMamu IL-18 was biologically active in vitro (data not shown). In addition, antibodies reactive to the recombinant Mamu-IL-18 appeared in the sera of most of the treated monkeys, suggesting either regulatory negative feedback mechanism or secondary to improperly processed and/or folding of IL-18 during synthesis (36) . Anecdotal evidence from collaborators using a DNA plasmid expressing the mature Mamu-IL-18 fused to the GM-CSF signal sequence for improved secretion suggest that this molecule was ineffective in enhancing SIV-specific responses (data not shown). Similarly, Dr. Giavedoni inoculated monkeys with a SIV construct in which nef was replaced with Mamu IL-18 gene but failed to detect any elevation of serum IFN-\u03b3, in spite of the IL-18 protein being expressed at high levels during the acute phase of viral replication (37) .

It is therefore important to define not only the cells and tissues that mediate immune function in these species, but also the molecules that mediate such function. This is especially true for those molecules whose function can be harnessed to modulate immune responses to the benefit of the host. Cytokines are the prime candidate in this regard and the finding that the administration of human cytokines into nonhuman primates leads to neutralizing antibodies against the human reagents, even though there is a high degree of homology, mandates that we utilize homologous cytokines for studies that especially require their evaluation and chronic use. This has been one of the primary emphasis of our lab and the findings from our studies are summarized here. In general, it is our finding that the dosing and in particular the schedule of administration of recombinant cytokines plays an important role in not only the quantity but also the quality of immune response that is generated. In all cases, the daily administration of cytokines was not as optimal as spacing the administration for at least every other day and in some cases perhaps once a week. IL-12 appeared to be highly effective in augmenting immune responses. Intermittent use of IL-2 with IL-15 appeared to have the maximal benefit for not only the magnitude of immune responses, but also the length and duration of memory immune responses. Further studies for the induction of disease-protective immune responses against lentiviruses are needed to determine the use of a number of additional cytokines such as IL-7 for its reported effect on inducing thymopoiesis and in select cases of homeostasis. These studies are currently in progress. It is important also to keep track of the growing number of additional cytokines that number approx 29 at present (39) and, relevant to the induction of localized mucosal immunity for the prevention of sexual transmission of lentiviral infection, the use of mucosal immunomodulatory cytokines and adjuvants (40) . Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that gene polymorphisms for select cytokines do exist, such as those for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, for example (41) , and the role such polymorphisms may play on the
