Its C-terminal domain (CTD) has been shown to associate with intracellular membrane, and we have previously shown that NS4B CTD contains a class I PDZ-binding motif (PBM). Here, we demonstrated that NS4B PBM interacts with the PDZ-containing tumor suppressor protein, Scribble, using immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and this interaction requires at least three contiguous PDZ domains of Scribble. In addition, NS4B PBM specifically induced Scribble degradation by activating the proteasomeubiquitin pathway. Similar Scribble degradation was also observed in HCV-infected cells, suggesting NS4B could work in the context of HCV. Finally, NS4B PBM mutants showed reduced colony formation capacity compared with its wild-type counterpart, indicating that NS4B PBM plays important roles in NS4B-mediated cell transformation. Altogether, we provide a mechanism by which NS4B induces cell transformation through its PBM, which specifically interacts with the PDZ domains of Scribble and targets Scribble for degradation.",

Although the precise mechanism underlying HCV replication process remains largely unclear, most of the HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins are known to be involved in membranous web (MW) and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) formed by protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, which is the site of the viral RNA synthesis [6] [7] [8] . One of the NS proteins that are indispensable for viral replication is HCV NS4B, which is a hydrophobic protein highly conserved in Flaviviridae family [9] . NS4B expression causes alteration of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and formation of MW, which could provide a platform for HCV viral replication [8, 10] . Our previous work has shown that NS4B expression activates unfolded protein response (UPR), ER overload response, and NF-\u03baB pathway in human hepatic cells, which could contribute to HCV replication and pathogenesis [11] [12] [13] .",

Furthermore, this interaction leads to scribble degradation through the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway. We also observed this proteasome-dependent Scribble degradation in HCV-infected Huh7.5.1 cells, suggesting that NS4B has some roles for HCV-mediated Scribble degradation. In addition, NS4B PBM confers the ability of NS4B to transform cells. Taken together, our study revealed a novel mechanism by which NS4B contributes to HCV tumorigenesis by targeting tumor suppressor protein, Scribble, for degradation.",

The replicon Con-1 was kindly provided by Prof. Ralf Bartenschlager (University of Heidelberg, Germany). To construct NS4B PBM mutants, the last four amino acids of NS4B were deleted or site-direct-mutated as alanine (AAAA) with appropriate sets of primers. The full-length cDNA of NS4B gene was designed as NS4BWT, the NS4B with last four amino acids deleted as NS4BD, and the NS4B with last four amino acids mutated as NS4BM. These NS4B sequences were inserted into pEGFPC1 and pFLAG-CMV2 plasmids (Invitrogen, USA) to construct pEGFPC1-NS4B, pEGFPC1-NS4BD, and pEGFPC1-NS4BM and pFLAG-CMV2-NS4B, pFLAG-CMV2-NS4BD, and pFLAG-CMV2-NS4BM, respectively.

Viral proteins have been shown to regulate Scribble either by altering its localization or triggering Scribble degradation [19] . From Fig. 1a , we found that NS4B does not affect the localization of Scribble. Hence, we explored whether NS4B affects the protein levels of Scribble. We transfected different amounts of NS4B expression plasmids into 293T and HepG2 cells and then examined the protein levels of Scribble. Increased expression of NS4B significantly reduced Scribble protein levels in both 293T (Fig. 4a) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 4b) . In NS4B-transfected 293T and HepG2 cells, NS4B expression was higher at 48-h post-transfection compared with 24-h post-transfection; however, Scribble protein levels were lower at 48-h post-transfection compared with 24-h post-transfection, revealing a negative correlation between NS4B expression and Scribble protein level. We also examined the impact of NS4B on the other two PDZ-containing proteins, lethal giant larvae2 (Lgl2) and protease-activated receptor-3 (Par3). Our data showed that their intracellular protein levels were not altered by NS4B expression (Fig. 4b -d, f; the Par3 protein data was not shown). These results indicate that NS4B specifically induced Scribble degradation. To understand how HCV NS4B triggered Scribble degradation, we examined the involvement of the proteasomeubiquitin pathway. First, we examined the effects of NS4B on the protein levels of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), a cytoplasmic protein that belongs to the ubiquitin-specific processing family of deubiquitinating enzymes [23, 24] . As shown in Fig. 5a , expression of HCV NS4B led to reduced USP14 protein levels in both 293T cells and HepG2 cells especially at 48-h post-transfection, indicating that HCV NS4B activates the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway.",

            "text": "The NS4B PBM-Scribble PDZ interaction is important for colony formation of transfected cells, indicating that NS4B PBM contributes to HCV pathogenesis and cellular transformation by inducing Scribble degradation. Interestingly, colony formation assay also showed that in the cells expressing the NS4B PBM mutants, more colonies were formed compared to empty vector-transfected cells, suggesting that there are additional unknown mechanisms whereby NS4B promotes transformed cell growth in addition to PBM. As NS4B nucleotidebinding motif (NBM) has been reported to induce tumor transformation [14] , it is highly likely that both NBM and PBM confer NS4B the potential to promote tumor transformation.",
