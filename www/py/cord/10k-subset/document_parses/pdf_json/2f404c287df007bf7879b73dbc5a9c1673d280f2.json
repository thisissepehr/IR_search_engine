            "text": "Abstract Objective: To assess the safety of non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (NB-BAL) in critically ill mechanically ventilated children. Setting: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary children's hospital. Methods: The data from 60 consecutive critically ill mechanically ventilated children who underwent NB-BAL was reviewed from November 1997 to December 1999. PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database. Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8\u00b143 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4\u00b114 kg). Four (7 %) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support. Forty-two (70 %) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL. However 5 (12 %) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL. Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications. Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed. All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure. sion and pyrexia [7] . In addition, B-BAL is impossible in ventilated neonates and young infants, since the smallest paediatric bronchoscopes (2.2 mm) have no suction ports. At present the standard paediatric flexible bronchoscope has an external diameter of 3.6 mm so that its use is precluded in patients intubated with an endotracheal tube of less than 4.5 mm in diameter.",

NB-BAL involves administering larger aliquots of saline conducted through a catheter that is advanced further down the airway, hence obtaining fluid of more distal origin [8] . Several studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of B-BAL [9, 10, 11, 12] and it has therefore been used as a simple and cheap alternative to B-BAL [8, 11, 13, 14] . Reports record that it is well-tolerated [10, 11, 15] , though deterioration of cardiorespiratory parameters within a physiologically accepted range has been described in ventilated newborn infants during the procedure [16, 17] . Dargaville et al. [8] have also described transient arterial desaturation in neonates, but did not demonstrate a relationship with severity of lung disease.",

During the procedure ventilation is provided by a T-Ayres bagging circuit delivering an FiO 2 of 1.0. The patient is supine with the head turned to the left or right for access to right or left main bronchus, respectively. The technique involves wedging a size 6F or 8F end hole suction catheter in children under 3 years old and a longer, funnel-tipped catheter in older children through the angled connector (swivel elbow, Intersurgical) of the endotracheal tube using a sealed access port adapter (suction port, SLE). 1 ml/kg (to a maximum of 10ml per instillation) of sterile physiological saline at room temperature is injected through the catheter, the syringe is detached and replaced by a sputum trap. The lungs are inflated and the chest wall is then vibrated during expiration as mechanical suction is applied, collecting the return fluid into the sputum trap, and the catheter is removed. This procedure is repeated 3 times unless the patient becomes clinically unstable. The three sputum traps with aspirate are immediately sent to the microbiology department for analysis.",

The other patient began to cough after the second instillation despite receiving morphine (30 mg/kg/hr) and midazolam (3 mg/kg/min) infusions. Four patients (10 %) experienced transient arterial oxygen desaturation to a minimum of 60 %, which was easily resolvable with manual ventilation and with no resulting prolonged compromise of gas exchange. Transient wheeze was recorded immediately after NB-BAL in one patient with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive bronchiolitis and one patient with atypical pneumonia. Finally, there was one patient episode of transient bradycardia that corrected with manual ventilation.",

However, five patients (12 %) experienced a substantial increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h after NB-BAL. One of these patients had experienced an immediate significant complication (prolonged arterial oxygen desaturation), two had transient arterial oxygen desaturation, the remaining patients had been stable at the time of NB-BAL. The patient with the greatest increase in OI was on HFOV and had received surfactant concurrently. Anticipating that these five patients might have had poorer oxygenation to begin with, we compared the change in OI at 1 h after NB-BAL to the baseline OI (Fig. 1) . There was no correlation (r 2 = 0.0019). Further analyses showed that there was no correlation with other clinical variables including PRISM score (r 2 = 0.01) sex, age, percentage aspirate or ventilation mode at the time of NB-BAL. The only observable association was that four out of the six patients who had baseline OIs of over 20 experienced significant immediate and/or late complications. At 6 h post NB-BAL, OI did not increase by more than 10 compared to baseline for any patient, including those who had experienced a substantial increase at 1 h (Fig. 2) . The two largest groups of patients with respiratory diseases were those with ARDS and atypical pneumonia, and these were analysed separately to see if these patients behaved differently in response to NB-BAL. There was no significant change in median OI in 24 patients with atypical pneumonia (2 of whom received surfactant) and 19 patients with ARDS. We also analysed 719 Fig. 1 Change in oxygenation index (OI) at 1 h post nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage as a function of baseline Ol (n = 42) those patients who had received surfactant immediately after NB-BAL, anticipating an improvement in oxygenation variables. Median OI significantly decreased overall in six patients who received surfactant immediately after NB-BAL, from 15 (IQR 12\u00b117) at baseline to 11 (IQR 10\u00b114) at 6 h post NB-BAL (p = 0.046). However, there was a non-significant increase in median OI at 1 h after the procedure to 16 (IQR 9\u00b126), which reflected the one patient who had experienced the greatest rise in OI.",

As far as we know this is not the published experience in infants and adults. Despite identifying and correcting risk factors in the patients, there was a higher than expected rate of significant immediate complications. Two patients required escalation of respiratory support and two patients experiencing significant hypotension required escalation of haemodynamic support. The latter observation is in contrast to that of Belai et al. [16] , who reported a transient increase in systolic blood pressure in neonates. Our cohort represents a different case mix of patients from the population described in Belai's paper. The patients were heterogeneous with a median age of 7 months ranging from 9 days to 15.3 years old, although there was no association between age and adverse effects. It is possible that our cohort of patients was sicker at the time of the NB-BAL, but unfortunately neither PRISM score nor OI predicted these patients exhibiting significant immediate complications. Transient arterial oxygen desaturation that readily resolves also occurred and has been described in babies by Dargaville [8] and Grigg [17] , and the ERS Task Force [3] corroborates this observation. One patient in our group had transient bradycardia (presumably due to a vasovagal response to catheter insertion), as has also been reported by Belai et al. [16] .",

However, five patients experienced an increase in OI of more than 10 (one of 45) at 1 h after NB-BAL, although none had a sustained increase at 6 h post NB-BAL, indicating that this was an effect of the procedure rather than due to worsening of the underlying disease process. Unfortunately our data did not indicate any predictive factors for deteriorating OI at 1 h after NB-BAL. The only observable relationship to baseline conditions was that more than half of all patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced either significant immediate or late (at 1 h) complications.",

It is not at present routine practice on our unit to instil surfactant following NB-BAL, unless it has been shown to be of benefit to the underlying disease process (e.g. PCP and meconium aspiration syndrome).
