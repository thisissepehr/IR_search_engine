For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information. The model results, which include the most likely set of infection spreading contacts, can be used to provide insight into future epidemic outbreak patterns, and aid in the development of intervention strategies.",

            "text": "The stochastic nature of the contagion process (i.e., contact between an infectious and susceptible person may or may not result in a new infection) makes it difficult to identify the path of infection or predict the impact that a new disease might have on a region. Over the last 100 years, significant research efforts have focused on predicting the expected spreading behavior of contact-based infectious diseases, exploiting characteristics of the population and the disease itself. However, there have been limited research efforts focusing on the use of future social network data: while current social network models are abstract constructs where people are anonymously represented as nodes, it is not unreasonable to expect developments in data collection (through Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc.) which will allow accurate mappings between known individuals. Spatial analysis of networks, such as transport and communication networks, is a growing area of research (Gastner and Newman 2006; Schintler et al. 2007; Erath et al. 2009 ), and has recently been expanded to include social network modeling, specifically the ability to reproduce spatial structure and interaction between individuals for large-scale social networks (Illenberger et al. 2012) . Furthermore, the ongoing development of activity-based travel models, which examine why, where and when various activities are engaged in by individuals (Lam and Huang 2003; Roorda et al. 2009; Ramadurai and Ukkusuri 2010) , as well as innovations in pedestrian modeling (Hoogendoorn and Bovy 2005) present additional promising alternatives to generate social contact networks in the future. As such, it is critical to develop methods which can exploit this data in aiding the prevention and mitigation of contagion episodes.",

This work specifically considers contact-based diseases, which refer to the family of infectious diseases that are transmitted from an infected to susceptible individual via direct contact. This category includes sexually transmitted diseases, various strands of the flu, SARS and the common cold, among others. In turn the social contact network is representative of the social interactions (e.g. through school, work or home) which occur among a group of individuals in a given time period (e.g. a day).",

            "text": "The problem approached in this paper considers the case in which the structure of the network is deterministically known (set of nodes and links), but time-of-infection data is available only for a fraction of the population. We further assume that no information is known about the infection tree (i.e., the set of social contacts through which the disease spread). We refer to this set of assumptions as the partial information version of the problem, in contrast to the full information case in which time-of-infection information is available for all infected nodes. In previous work by Gardner et al. (2012) , an application of the full information problem was addressed, where the objective was to infer the most likely air travel routes responsible for spreading the Swine Flu to unexposed geographic regions. In Gardner's paper social contact networks were not considered, and the network structure was defined by the air traffic system. Generalization of the full information case to the partial information case introduces a significant increase in computational complexity. The partial information problem can be modeled as an integer program, and represents a considerably more difficult problem to solve than the full information case. Heuristic solution methods are therefore developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The model performance is based on how accurately it predicts the paths of infection for a given contagion episode (which are extracted from simulation outputs). The outcome of the model can provide insight into future epidemic outbreak behavior and aid in the evaluation and recommendation of intervention strategies. In addition, the proposed solution methodology can be extended to alternative contagion processes which occur atop known network structures (e.g. tracking food borne outbreaks which propagate though a distribution network).",

In efforts to predict expected disease spreading behavior and characteristics, epidemiological models span from extremely generalized and simplified analytical models to increasingly in-depth stochastic agent based simulation tools. Analytical models are used to quantify the statistical properties of epidemic patterns (Colizza et al. 2006; Balcan et al. 2009 ); however, they are unable to capture certain behavioral aspects of the dynamics of disease spreading, and often lack detailed information about the network structure. In contrast, agent based simulation models can be used to replicate possible spreading scenarios, predict average spreading behavior, and analyze various intervention strategies for a given network and disease while capturing a greater degree of detail, but in turn require a highly detailed set of input data (see Rvachev and Longini (1985) , Epstein and Cummings (2002) , Eubank et al.

The most recent and comprehensive models provide a greater degree of realism, but are difficult to implement within the short time frames in which real time control decisions must be made. Large scale simulation models can also be computationally taxing because multiple runs are required to accurately predict expected outcomes.",

Most contagion models predict future potential outbreak scenarios based on system-wide information; however, they are not able to reconstruct the contagion process of an ongoing outbreak to reveal information about the current state of the network. Recent advances in disease modeling have begun addressing this issue. For example, there are models which use genetic sequencing data to analytically infer the geographic history of a given virus's migration (Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Lemey et al. 2009; Wallace et al. 2007; Cottam et al. 2008; Haydon et al.; 2003) . Often this approach involves first enumerating all possible evolutionary trees, then assigning posterior probabilities based on specifics of the respective virus' mutation rates. Additionally the infection trees only include locations where samples were available. Jombart et al. (2009) proposed a novel approach to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of outbreaks from sequence data by inferring ancestries directly between strains of an outbreak using their genotype and collection date. The \"infectious\" links were selected such that the number of mutations between nodes is minimized. The idea of using infection data to construct the most likely path of transmission is the highlighted goal of this paper.",

During each time step, we identify all links that connect infectious nodes and susceptible nodes, and perform an infection trial for each such link.

Once a node is recovered it can no long transmit the disease or become infected again (the equivalent of gaining immunity or being removed from the network).

We can exploit Lemma 2 to more easily construct a feasible solution by adding any links that satisfy the conditions of the lemma a priori. This procedure is defined in Algorithm 1. The objective of the algorithm is to identify a set of link variables, x ji , to fix a priori based on their contribution to the objective function (27). To do this the variable bestPredecessorValue (initialized to\u2212\u221e) is created to identify the incoming link for each node which maximizes the contribution to the objective function (27), such that both nodes belong to I. The bestPredecessorValue variable is updated by evaluating each incoming link ( j,i) for node i such that i,j \u2208 I. The best incoming link will be added to the solution, and its corresponding x ji variable fixed to 1. Fixing variables a priori will decrease the number of decision variables in A_ILP. Additionally, the way in which they are fixed guarantees a feasible solution can be obtained. The outline of the algorithm is outlined below. The next step of the heuristic is implemented to find a set of initial feasible solutions, which is accomplished by solving A_ILP. Steps (ii)-(v) of the heuristic exploit not only the optimal solution to A_ILP, but also intermediate solutions found throughout the resolution of the problem. We solve A_ILP using a branch and cut procedure which is implemented using a commercial IP solver. More precisely, after fixing a sub-set of the links to be included in the tree (based on the output from Algorithm 1), we solve A_ILP to optimality. While solving A_ILP we store a subset of the feasible solutions found, which will be used as starting solutions in the subsequent steps of the heuristic.

Various studies have found that power law networks are representative of many real world networks, including social contact networks (Barab\u00e1si and Albert 1999; Gonzalez et al. 2008) . Power law networks have a hub and spoke type structure with few highly connected nodes, (known as super spreaders in the context of contagion problems), while most nodes have a very low degree. Due to the extremely heterogeneous structure of power law networks contagion processes behave differently compared with more homogenous network structures such as Poisson and uniform networks. In addition a power law network structure is much more subjective to the transmission properties of the disease; a low transmission probability translates to a low probability of infecting a super spreader node, therefore an outbreak is less likely to spread to a large proportion of the population. As the transmission probability increases the probability of infecting a super spreader increases, significantly Regarding the model performance, in Figs. 3, 5 and 7 the dotted line represents the performance of the solution from A_ILP, and the solid line represents the performance of the heuristic solution.

The reason the performance improvement is greater for Q and B relative to the percentage of correctly labeled nodes and links is because on average only 20 % of links and 65 % of the nodes are included in the simulated infection tree for the power law network, therefore each correctly infected node and link will have a larger marginal impact for the performance measures Q and B in comparison to the performance measures which account for the entire network structure (i.e. percentage of correctly labeled nodes and links). The same behavior applies to all network structures; therefore the performance measures are not included for the Poisson and uniform networks. The correct labeling of the nodes and links (above 90 % for both measures) suggests the uninfected nodes (and links) are being appropriately excluded by the model. Figure 3 also reveals the dominating performance of the heuristic relative to A_ILP at the node level, but not the link level. The overall node-level performance of the heuristic exceeds the link-level performance because it is possible for the heuristic to correctly predict the set of infected nodes without correctly predicting every infected link. Each network and contagion scenario will result in a set of infected nodes which may exhibit many feasible (link-level) infection patterns. As such, it is possible for Fig. 4 (a) Percent of correctly labelled nodes and (b) Percent of correctly labelled links by heuristic as a function of outbreak size for power law network structure under 70 % information availability the heuristic to correctly predict a higher percentage of infected nodes than infected links. The difference in node level and link level performance suggest that A_ILP does a poor job at identifying the set of infected nodes, but a better job at identifying the set of infected links; additionally, the heuristic is able to significantly improve upon the set of infected nodes identified by A_ILP, but is unable to significantly improve upon the set of links identified in the same solution. The node level performance gap between A_ILP and heuristic is due to the accuracy of the node addition step of the heuristic, until which the set of nodes is constrained to those included in the initial feasible tree. The set of nodes added in this step can represent a substantial percentage of the total infected nodes, often improving upon the A_ILP solution by 60 %. However the set of links selected to branch to the newly added nodes are not as accurately identified. This behavior is observed across network structures.",

It is however interesting to note that the larger outbreaks (greater than 80 % of the nodes infected) are also predicted more accurately for the uniform network structure, with 80 % of the nodes correctly labeled, relative to 70 % for Poisson networks. As the most homogenous of the networks evaluated, the uniform network resulted in improved heuristic performance at both the node and link level relative to the other network structures. In contrast A_ILP performance was poorest for the uniform network node prediction. Figure 7 illustrates a similar trend in model performance relative to information availability. The main focus of this research was to develop a formulation and solution method for inferring a contagion process in a social contact network where only a selection of the infections are known of. A heuristic solution method was proposed which exploits known properties of the problem, and reduces to solving various simpler subproblems. The proposed methodology provides a novel procedure for evaluating a region that has been exposed to infection (compared with the traditional methods of enumeration followed by a posteriori analysis). The performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated as a function of information availability and network structure, and the heuristic was shown to accurately identify infection spreading links and unreported infected nodes.",

The largest weakness with the proposed methodology is the lack of verifiability due to limited data availability. Without accurate social contact networks and link-level infection data to validate the model's performance, it is not possible to evaluate certain model characteristics. As such, one major motivation for this work is to incentivize better data collection efforts. For the proposed model, collecting contact-level infection data would be the most valuable. Contact level information requires data from infected individuals on their recent social interactions. Such linklevel infection data is difficult to collect, but would permit quantitative analysis of the models' performance. Additionally research in the development of social networks which more accurately depict the set of social contacts in a region will be integral in the implementability of this research. One such approach is to exploit regional travel patterns to define a social network. By using regional travel patterns (such as origindestination tables and activity-based travel patterns), individuals' daily trips, specific types of interaction, and length of interaction can be accounted for. With an accurate Fig. 8 (a) Percent of correctly labeled nodes and (b) Percent of correctly labeled links by heuristic as a function of outbreak size for uniform network structure under 70 % information availability depiction of individuals daily contact patterns, the proposed model can be implemented to provide information on the set of contacts most likely responsible for spreading infection during an outbreak, aiding in the development of regional mitigation strategies.",
