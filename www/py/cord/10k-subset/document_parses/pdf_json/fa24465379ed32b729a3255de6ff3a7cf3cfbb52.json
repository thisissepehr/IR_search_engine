Methods: We randomly divided a total of 1571 adult patients who started CRRT for acute kidney injury into training (70%, n = 1094) and test (30%, n = 477) sets. The primary output consisted of the probability of mortality during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine learning algorithms with that of the APACHE II, SOFA, and the new abbreviated mortality scoring system for acute kidney injury with CRRT (MOSAIC model) results.",

The prevalence of AKI has been increasing by up to 50% in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [3] [4] [5] . Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a widely used renal replacement modality, particularly when patients have severe AKI and are unstable, because it can easily control biochemical imbalances caused by AKI [6, 7] . Despite the benefits of this modality, the mortality rate remains high, ranging from 30 to 70% [8] [9] [10] .

Categorical and continuous variables are expressed as proportions and the means \u00b1 standard deviation, respectively. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables (Fisher's exact test if not applicable). The Student's t test was used to compare continuous variables. Several machine learning algorithms were used, such as \u03ba-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boost (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN). The KNN modeling was performed using a hyperparameter selection process (\u03ba) involving leaveone-out cross-validation to determine the best accuracy for the training set. The Euclidean distance was used to train the KNN model. The rectangular, triangular, Epanechnikov, biweight, Gaussian, rank, and optimal kernels were used in training. We developed the SVM models using various kernels including linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis functions. For each kernel, we conducted 10-fold cross-validation and selected the best hyperparameter (cost, gamma, degree, and coefficients). We selected the kernel corresponding to the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the final SVM model. We conducted 10-fold crossvalidation to develop the MARS model on the training set. The maximum degree of interaction and the MiniSpan were set to three, indicating the allowance of three evenly spaced knots for each predictor. To select the hyperparameter for the RF model, we used 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. The hyperparameter included ntree (number of trees), mtry (number of variables used in each tree), and nodesize (minimum size of nodes, which determines depth). We used 10-fold crossvalidation to develop the XGB model and determined the best hyperparameter consisting of eta (step size shrinkage used in the update process to prevent overfitting), gamma (minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition), and the maximum depth of a tree. We used 10-fold cross-validation to construct the ANN model and determined the optimal hyperparameter consisting of the size (the number of hidden nodes) and decay (parameter for weight decay). When developing the KNN, SVM, and ANN models, we standardized all of the prediction variables except for the categorical variables for analysis. Herein, categorical variables were processed using one-hot encoding. Once we developed the models using the training set, we calculated the F1 score, accuracy, and AUCs on the test set to measure the performance of each model. To calculate the accuracy and F1 score of the APACHE II, SOFA, and MO-SAIC results, we used the best threshold point of the receiver operating characteristic curve to determine the probability of mortality. The AUCs of the models were compared using the DeLong test. The net benefit of the machine learning model was assessed by using decision curve analysis [23, 24] . In the decision curve analysis, APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC scores were converted to a logistic regression using probability theory. Calibration, which is the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed frequencies of ICU mortality, was assessed with calibration belts. All P values were twosided, and values less than 0.05 were considered significant. ",

The APACHE II and SOFA scores are representative of these methods and have demonstrated accurate prediction of mortality in this patient subset [13, 14, [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, these approaches showed poor performance for critically ill patients with AKI [11, 12] . Two other scoring models have been applied to critically ill patients with AKI. The HELENICC score, which focused on patients with septic AKI, used five variables (norepinephrine utilization, liver failure, medical condition, and lactate and pre-dialysis creatinine levels) and demonstrated good performance in predicting 7-day mortality (AUC = 0.82) [12] . Another model, which focused on ICU-admitted patients with AKI, also showed good performance for predicting 7-day mortality (AUC = 0.85) [11] . However, these models did not focus on patients initiating CRRT for AKI. A few studies have identified risk factors of mortality in patients receiving CRRT [29, 30] . Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a mortality prediction model because a few clinical variables may not be sufficient to precisely predict patient outcome. Recently, our MOSAIC model achieved suitable performance with respect to mortality prediction for patients receiving CRRT (AUC = 0.772), but the approach requires further validation and the addition of new variables may be difficult [22] . Machine learning algorithms may solve these problems and will have the added benefit of increased accuracy with the accumulation of data.",

Nevertheless, the present study has some limitations. Because of a single-center design, the models may not be directly applicable to other centers with different treatment plans and patient characteristics. Nevertheless, this issue does not infringe on the purpose of the study, which entails applying machine learning to predict the mortality of patients initiating CRRT for AKI, rather than developing the final generalized model for clinical use. Achieving acceptable performance with a supervised deep-learning algorithm requires more than 5000 data points [34] , but the present dataset consisted of a modest sample size.",
