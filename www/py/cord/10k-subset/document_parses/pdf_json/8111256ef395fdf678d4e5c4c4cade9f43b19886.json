            "text": "Congratulations! You have just opened what may come to be seen as a seminal publication from the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE). Within these pages you will find research papers from the IChemE-published journals which relate in one way or another to our Climate Emergency. They cover a great deal of ground -from atmospheric CO 2 removal all the way to the carbon footprint of sandwiches; from the bioeconomy to flaring, CCS to ball milling! Research plays a vital role in leading to policy adoptionbut it is no substitute for policy formulation, adoption and implementation. So the editors hope that you will find in these pages issues on which you can take action to mitigate the drastic and dramatic consequences of our wholly unsustainable global activity -in energy use, resource extraction and processing, habitat destruction -which pose a real threat to the survival of civilisation on this planet. This must be the objective of our Institution's flagship 'sustainable development' which was championed by the UN in the Brundtland Report. So tackling climate change is not about simply doing the things we already do more efficiently, or meeting some concept of economic growth based on current measurement criteria: it requires a fundamental shift in approach, and we have to succeed in implementing dramatic change within a 30year time horizon. This has been eloquently put by Myles Allen (the physicist behind 'net zero'), in a radio 4 interview with Jim Al-Khalili (BBC)",

Currently, global production and consumption levels are overshooting the planet's biocapacity by about 50% each year (Sustainable Development). In other words we have already grown beyond ecological limits, and growth is no longer an option on a global scale. This ecological overshoot is due almost entirely to overconsumption in rich countries (Giljum et al., 2014) . SDG 8 calls for improving 'global resource efficiency' and 'decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation'. However, global material extraction and consumption has doubled over the past 30 years (National Footprint Accounts, 2016), and has accelerated since 2000. Within my lifetime the world's population has trebled, and so has resource consumption per head. So a policy of 'sustainable production' is by itself simply unsustainable.",

Up to $20tn (\u00a316tn) of assets could be stranded and wiped out if the climate emergency is not addressed effectively. But he also noted that great fortunes could be made by those working to end greenhouse gas emissions -with a big potential upside for the UK economy in particular. He also warned that the global transition required to tackle the climate crisis could result in an abrupt financial collapse: the longer that action to reverse emissions is delayed, the more the risk of collapse will grow. Most significantly, he told those who question the consensus on climate change: \"We can't afford on this one to have selective information, spin, misdirection. . . It needs to be absolutely clear because we are all in on it.\" (Mark Carney).",

According to climate scientists, the world must halve its emissions by 2030 to stand any chance of avoiding disastrous climate breakdown. Yet there are indications of an acceleration in warming -partly as a result of the albedo effect: the reduction in the surface reflectivity as a result of shrinkage of snow cover in the Arctic; and partly as a result of thawing of the Arctic tundra, leading to the evolution of vast quantities of methane gas. If we add to these the calving of huge icesheets from the Thwaites glacier and the Antarctic continent, then the rise in sea level -affecting and displacing possibly as much as 40% of the (growing) global population -appears inevitable and indeed imminent.",

Their report on the economic risks of human-caused global overheating says that climate policy has to change, or else the world faces irreversible consequences. It highlights the growing concern among Wall Street institutions about the financial and reputational risks of continued funding of carbon-intensive industries such as oil and gas. And they \"cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened\". (Yet this comes from a company that, since the Paris agreement, has provided \u00a361 billion in financial services to the companies that are most aggressively expanding sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration).",

The report acknowledges a massive global market failure: producers and consumers of CO 2 emissions do not pay for the climate damage that results. It highlights the need for a global carbon tax to reverse this damage; but is cautious that this is \"not going to happen any time soon\" because of concerns about jobs and competitiveness.",
