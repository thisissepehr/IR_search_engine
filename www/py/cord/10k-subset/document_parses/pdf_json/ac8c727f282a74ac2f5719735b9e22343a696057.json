Although most of the codetected organisms have a known pathogenic potential, their contribution to the episodes of CAP in these patients is unclear, given that NP/OP specimens are an indirect measure of what is causing infection in the lung. The proportion of specimens with at least 1 bacterial or viral codetection identified along with M pneumoniae in children hospitalized with CAP is consistent with previous reports, ranging from 50 to >90%, depending on the extent of pathogen testing performed [4] [5] [6] . A high prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization with the most commonly codetected bacteria in the current study, including S pneumoniae and H influenzae, has been reported in children with and without respiratory illness [9] [10] [11] [12] . Likewise, human rhinoviruses, commonly codetected with M pneumoniae in pediatric specimens in the current study, were found in similar proportions in children with CAP enrolled in the EPIC study compared with asymptomatic controls [13] . Codetection of influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, human parechovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus was relatively uncommon (<3.0%) in M pneumoniae-positive specimens, similar to previous reports [4-7, 14, 15] . The presence of both viral and bacterial organisms in a single specimen, which was only observed in children and has previously been associated with disease severity [5, 16] , warrants further investigation. Additional studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying interactions of codetected organisms with M pneumoniae and the potential impact on the severity of CAP, particularly in children. This analysis has several shortcomings, including previously identified limitations related to the EPIC study design [1] [2] [3] . In particular, the presence of codetected pathogens in upper respiratory specimens may not be clinically relevant. Analysis of lower respiratory specimens may be a preferable specimen type for assessment of the potential contribution of these organisms to CAP; however, collection of lower respiratory specimens is more invasive and difficult to obtain. Furthermore, because M pneumoniae adheres to and replicates in the nasopharynx or oropharynx [17] [18] [19] , detection in NP/OP swabs likely represents infectious shedding rather than carriage. Tests performed in the TAC format may be less sensitive compared with individual real-time PCR assays, potentially due to the substantially lower reaction volume [20] . Other variables, including the longer duration of storage, additional thawing of frozen specimen, and different extraction method may also impact the ability to detect respiratory pathogens in these specimens. Finally, the TAC design used in the current study was not customized specifically for this patient population, and thus it may not represent the ideal repertoire of assays for testing of upper respiratory tract specimens from both children and adults. Although TAC is a powerful diagnostic tool that could improve patient management and streamline testing decisions for clinicians during CAP, it is currently used for research only, and further validation is needed to support widespread implementation of this technology in clinical laboratories.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 572, "end": 575, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 576, "end": 579, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 580, "end": 583, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 808, "end": 811, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 812, "end": 816, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 822, "end": 826, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1064, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1283, "text": "[4-7, 14, 15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1455, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1459, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1817, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1821, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1825, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2279, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2284, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2289, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2543, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae was rarely detected in NP/OP swab specimens collected from asymptomatic controls in the EPIC study primary analysis, [1, 2] , suggesting that M pneumoniae is not a common colonizer of the upper respiratory tract and, when present, indicates a contribution to ongoing disease.
