We report the outcomes of pediatric brain tumors treated with AHSCT in a quaternary referral center in Hong Kong over 10 years (). Thirteen patients with medulloblastoma (n = 9), cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 1), ependymoma (n = 1), germ cell tumor (n = 1) and cerebellar rhabdoid (n = 1) were transplanted because of tumor residual (n = 1) or recurrence (n = 12). Uniform upfront treatment protocols were adopted according to specific tumor types. Prior to AHSCT, 8 patients (61.5%) achieved complete remission and 5 (38.5%) were in partial remission. Conditioning employed thiotepa 300 mg/m 2 , etoposide 250 mg/m 2 and carboplatin 500 mg/m 2 daily for 3 days. Toxicity included mucositis and neutropenic fever in all patients, grade 4 hepatic toxicity in 4 patients (including hepatic veno-occlusive disease in 2 patients) and grade 4 renal toxicity in 1 patient. The 5year event-free survival was 53.9%. Five patients died of disease recurrence or progression 8-21 months after transplant with a median disease-free period of 8 months post-transplant. One died of transplant-related complications in the early post-transplant period. Seven survived for a median of 5.4 years (maximum follow-up of 9.8 years), with six having Lansky-Karnofsky performance score above 80. All survivors had complete remission before transplant though 2 had leptomeningeal spread. We conclude that AHSCT can achieve long-term survival in children with recurrent brain tumor.

Multimodality treatment involving surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy has drastically improved the survival of many children with brain tumors nowadays. However, the cure rate remains poor in some high-risk histological types, and for patients with residual, recurrent or disseminated disease. Therapeutic options in most of these patients are limited by previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Over the past decade, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) has been tried in patients with high-risk brain tumors in an attempt to eradicate residual neoplastic cells and improve cure rate. Alkylating agents have been the main class of drugs used because of their steep dose-response curve. Thiotepa, carmustine and melphalan are well suited for this approach because they can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and their primary dose limiting toxicity is bone marrow suppression. It has been found that the levels of thiotepa and its active metabolite TEPA are similar in plasma and cerebro-spinal fluid [1] , and alkylating agents exhibit significant activity against different brain tumors in cell cultures and animal models [2] [3] [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1151, "end": 1154, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1277, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Up till now data are still limited in children concerning the efficacy and safety of the approach of high-dose chemotherapy with AHSCT to treat high-risk brain tumors.

All patients received upfront multi-modality treatments according to internationally accepted protocols which were the same in all hospitals treating pediatric brain tumors in Hong Kong. None of the patients were formally enrolled in clinical trials of these protocols. Medulloblastoma and cerebral PNET were treated with surgery and radiotherapy before 1997 and chemotherapy was added afterwards. For children before 3 years old, radiotherapy was witheld and chemotherapy was given according to the POG protocol [10] . For children above 3 years old, combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin-CCNU-vincristine (CCV) were given according to the CCG protocol [11] . Ependymoma was treated with surgery and radiotherapy; and intracranial germ cell tumor was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to the SFOP protocol [12] . All patients received radiotherapy, 8 as upfront treatment and 5 as rescue treatment upon recurrence because these patients were too young at initial diagnosis (\\ 2.5 years, n = 4) or parents refused radiotherapy initially (n = 1).

Thus it appeared that craniospinal irradiation with primary site booster had not prevented metastasis or relapse at primary site. For those 5 patients with rescue radiotherapy, 4 achieved complete remission before AHSCT and 1 had gross residual disease at primary site.

Previous case series with more than 10 patients are summarized in Table 3 . In these series, tumor response rates ranged from 0% to 71%, and transplant-related mortality ranged from 0% to 33%. The overall and event-free survival rates were also highly variable. Such variable results might be explained by significant heterogeneity in the underlying tumor type, pre-transplant treatment regimen, extent of disease, conditioning regimen and adjuvant treatments. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents had previously been used in the preparatory phase of transplant and most employed a combination of 2 or 3 drugs. No existing data had clearly defined the most effective and safe conditioning regimen for pediatric brain tumors so far. We therefore applied the combination of thiotepa, etoposide and carboplatin as conditioning for all of our brain tumor patients who underwent autologous HSCT. This approach achieved a response rate, overall and event-free survivals comparable to previous reports with acceptable therapy-related toxicity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 284, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the study by Finlay, there were no long-term survivors after treatment with the combination of high dose thiotepa and etoposide for patients with cerebral PNET or medulloblastoma [13] . It appears that the addition of carboplatin to the conditioning regimen leads to a substantial improvement in outcome for this group of patients, with approximately 50% long-term survival in our cohort and 29-34% in other studies [5, 6] . Another conditioning regimen that results in similar long-term survival in patients with medulloblastoma is the combination of thiotepa and busulfan, which has also been reported to have 50% eventfree survival at 3 years [20] . However, post-transplant adjuvant radiotherapy was used in a significant proportion of patients, which might have contributed to the favorable outcome. Although no severe adverse effects were reported in that series, busulfan is notorious for causing hepatic veno-occlusive disease, which occurred in up to two-thirds of patients in another series [21] . Therefore, in patients with medulloblastoma or PNET, the combination of carboplatin with thiotepa and etoposide appears to be one of the safest and most effective regimens. The morbidity and mortality associated with carboplatin could also be reduced with the use of the Calvert formula. From the literature, it seems that pineoblastoma, ependymoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor and diffuse pontine glioma had particularly poor outcomes after AHSCT. Better conditioning regimens or alternative approaches need to be devised for these types of tumors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 419, "end": 422, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 423, "end": 425, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 649, "end": 653, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1008, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Despite having poorer prognosis, we found that patients with leptomeningeal spread could still be salvaged with megatherapy and AHSCT and achieved long-term survival.

Gururangun found that 62.5% of patients with complete remission and 44.4% of patients with minimal residual disease \\ 2 cm survived, compared to 33.3% of patients with bulky disease [7] . Similarly, Fagioli found that patients with complete remission had better event-free survival (50.6%) at 3 years than those with measurable disease (19.6%) [14] ; and Busca found that 100% of patients with complete remission survived but no patient with residual disease survived long-term [18] . Our study also concurred in that only patients who had achieved complete remission before AHSCT had long-term survival. For medulloblastoma and PNET, Fagioli, Perez-Martinez, and Graham found that patients with complete remission had better survival (80%, 45.5% and 41.7% respectively) than patients with measurable disease (16.7%, 37.5% and 30.8% respectively) [14, 17, 19] . Gururangun found that 100% of those with complete remission and 50% of those with minimal residual disease survived [7] , while Broniscer found that 45.4% of patients with complete remission or minimal residual disease survived but none of patients with bulky disease survived [6] . For high grade glioma, Finlay found that patients with minimal residual disease \\ 2 cm had better survival (55.6%) than those with gross residual disease (0%) [13] ; while Grovas found that patients with complete remission had the best chance of survival (50%), followed by those with minimal residual disease \\ 2 cm (20%) [23] . None of the patients with bulky disease survived [23] . In conclusion, it appears that cure is most likely in patients with complete remission, less likely in patients with minimal residual disease and unlikely in patients with bulky disease before AHSCT. Those with partial remission before AHSCT probably could not eradicate their malignancies even with megatherapy and most died of disease progression eventually. However, 2 patients with partial remission before AHSCT in our study achieved complete remission post-transplant, which lasted for 11-13 months; and 3 other patients with residual disease before AHSCT had stable disease for 4-8 months before progression. The short-lasting response to high-dose chemotherapy in these patients might be related to intrinsic chemo-resistance of these tumors as evidenced by sub-optimal response to previous upfront and second-line chemotherapy. The fact that they had higher tumor load with macroscopic residual disease also made them less likely to be cured by a single course of megatherapy and AHSCT. Other investigators have therefore tried to optimize the response by applying multiple sequential courses of megatherapy followed by repeated AHSCT [28] [29] [30] . Whether this intensive approach can result in better long-term survival without much added toxicity remains to be answered in future prospective longterm studies. Nevertheless, even a single course of megatherapy with AHSCT might be able to prolong survival for patients with gross residual disease. However, clinicians have to balance the definite risk of treatment-related mortality and toxicities against the potential benefit and modest gain in life expectancy; and detailed discussion with parents and patients are warranted before deciding to perform megatherapy and AHSCT. For curative intent, efforts should be made to achieve complete remission before AHSCT by further surgery and/or chemo-irradiation, since megatherapy with AHSCT works best as consolidation and cure is likely only in the absence of gross residual disease. Furthermore, radiotherapy before or after AHSCT might have favorable impact at relapse in those young children not initially irradiated, as we found that 4 of 5 patients who received radiotherapy (full dose 36 Gy craniospinal irradiation with focal boost) following relapse but prior to transplant survived, with the only failure being the child with localized residual tumor immediately pre-transplant. Similar findings were reported by Gururangan [7] and Dupuis-Girod [20] . These groups irradiate children with 18 Gy with focal boost [7] or in the case of local recurrences, only focal boost without craniospinal irradiation [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 135, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 136, "end": 138, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 139, "end": 142, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 143, "end": 146, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 147, "end": 151, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 162, "end": 165, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 350, "end": 353, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 512, "end": 516, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 646, "end": 650, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1023, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1027, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1149, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1476, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1640, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1696, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2847, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2848, "end": 2852, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2853, "end": 2857, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 4144, "end": 4147, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4165, "end": 4169, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4232, "end": 4235, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4323, "end": 4327, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Adverse effects from megatherapy were tolerable and manageable in most patients in the current study. Although all patients had profound cytopenia after conditioning chemotherapy which resulted in neutropenic fever, most patients responded to G-CSF and achieved neutrophil engraftment before 17 days. Renal toxicity was reversible in all patients except the one who died of multi-organ failure. In general, dose modification for carboplatin should be made according to the Calvert formula for patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Since all of our patients had normal renal function before transplant, no dose modification was made. We did not encounter severe neurological or pulmonary toxicity in our patients. Our conditioning regimen of thiotepa, carboplatin and etoposide may be less likely to induce neurological toxicity than busulfan plus thiotepa [21] , or pulmonary toxicity than carmustine plus thiotepa plus etoposide [23] . It is notable that our chemotherapeutic regimen had resulted in a relatively high frequency of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (15.4%), though not as high as that reported by Valteau-Cauanet (66.7%), who used busulfan and thiotepa as conditioning [21] . However, our two patients responded well to supportive treatment and eventually recovered. The single patient who died in the early post-transplant period was thought to have engraftment syndrome as he had developed adult respiratory distress syndrome at the time of rapid surge of neutrophils. He finally succumbed to sepsis with multi-organ failure. He was the oldest patient in our series. Whether we should reduce the doses of chemotherapeutic drugs in adolescent or young adult patients to minimize the risk of transplant-related mortality requires further studies. The current study had several limitations. First, this is a retrospective review and not a prospective trial and therefore is subject to possible observation and selection biases. Nevertheless, we have included all patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented to AHSCT in our center to minimize bias and most data were organized and complete in the database of our departmental computer server. Second, the results of AHSCT might depend on efficacy of upfront treatments and therefore evolution of upfront treatments for pediatric brain tumors over time might have confounded the results. Third, the sample size is small limiting the statistical power of analyzing treatment outcomes in patients with different tumors and prognostic factors. Further multi-center studies of larger sample size are needed to confirm our findings and to determine the prognostic significance of various patient and disease characteristics. Given the heterogeneity of results in previous studies, a meta-analysis aiming at pooling the data should be considered so that there is sufficient statistical power to detect the differences in posttransplant survival and transplant-related mortality among different subgroups of tumor types and treatment regimens. Fourth, we did not have formal neuropsychological testing or quality of life assessment for most patients and the Lansky-Karnofsky performance score we reported was just a very crude measure of functional status of the patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 863, "end": 867, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 937, "end": 941, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1194, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, AHSCT can result in long-term survival with satisfactory functional status in children with recurrent brain tumors, especially for those who can achieve complete remission before transplant.

Those with gross residual tumor before transplant also had poor long-term survival. However, they might still respond to the treatment with temporary remission or stable disease for a meaningful period of time.
