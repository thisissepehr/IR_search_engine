            "text": "In a recent study, we proposed a novel method to evaluate hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) by assessing propofolinduced changes in the 19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). The study suggested that patients with HIE are unable to generate EEG slow waves during propofol anesthesia 48 h after cardiac arrest (CA). Since a low number of electrodes would make the method clinically more practical, we now investigated whether our results received with a full EEG cap could be reproduced using only forehead electrodes. Experimental data from comatose post-CA patients (N = 10) were used. EEG was recorded approximately 48 h after CA using 19-channel EEG cap during a controlled propofol exposure. The slow wave activity was calculated separately for all electrodes and four forehead electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8) by determining the low-frequency (< 1 Hz) power of the EEG. HIE was defined by following the patients' recovery for six months. In patients without HIE (N = 6), propofol substantially increased (244 \u00b1 91%, mean \u00b1 SD) the slow wave activity in forehead electrodes, whereas the patients with HIE (N = 4) were unable to produce such activity. The results received with forehead electrodes were similar to those of the full EEG cap. With the experimental pilot study data, the forehead electrodes were as capable as the full EEG cap in capturing the effect of HIE on propofol-induced slow wave activity. The finding offers potential in developing a clinically practical method for the early detection of HIE.",

To improve prognostic accuracy, clinical examination has been supported with additional methods, consisting of electrophysiological measurements, blood biomarkers, and brain imaging [3] . While known to hold prognostic information in HIE for decades, the recent progress in measurement devices, including improved wireless and computational properties, has made electroencephalogram (EEG) possibly the most promising clinical tool for the assessment of brain function after CA.

For successful EEG recording, one of the key issues is the electrodes, which should be easy to attach and should maintain their contact securely, thus enabling long-term high-quality signal acquisition. Electrodes attachable to the patient's forehead with minimal preparation offer potentially the most convenient approach for EEG recording in the intensive care unit (ICU) where patients usually lie on their back. However, limiting the number of electrodes to the forehead area potentially jeopardizes the reliable interpretation of the signal. In this study, we investigated whether the slow wave activity during propofol anesthesia after CA, previously shown to differentiate patients with a good and with a poor outcome, could be detected using only forehead electrodes instead of the full 19-channel EEG cap.",

The patients went through an experiment in which their EEG was recorded approximately 48 h after CA while the infusion of propofol, used for sedation of the patient, was incrementally decreased to zero. The decrease was started from the highest acceptable infusion rate during the intensive care (4 mg kg \u22121 h \u22121 ) and continued following a predefined protocol (see Fig. 1a ) until the drug administration was finally switched off. EEG was recorded using a 19-channel cap with electrodes located according to the 10/20 international system. A sampling frequency of 500 Hz and bandwidth of 0.053-125 Hz was used and the signals were referenced to common average. After the experiment, the patients were followed for 6 months after which their neurological outcome was classified according to the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) to either good (CPC = 1-2) or poor (CPC = 3-5). Based on this outcome, the patients were assigned to one of two groups.",

A 5-min signal sample was picked before each decrease in the drug infusion rate and at the end of the experiment. From the 5-min signal samples, a maximum of four 30-s artifact-free sequences were visually selected. Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated for these selected signal sequences using Welch's averaged periodogram method [13] with 5-s Hamming window and 4.9-s overlap. An average over the maximum of four sequences was computed to represent a robust PSD estimate. Low-frequency power of the signal was then determined by summing the components below 1 Hz from the PSD estimates.

The infusion rate-wise comparisons (see Table 1 ) showed statistically significant difference between the groups at infusion rate 4 mg kg \u22121 h \u22121 with forehead channels (P < 0.01) similar to all channels (P < 0.01).",

It has been shown that propofol-induced changes in the EEG are most prominently seen in the frontal montages [15] . While this \"anteriorization\" effect has been well described in alpha activity, whose power is totally lost in posterior areas during anesthesia [16] , the same frontal dominance is seen in lower frequencies [17] . Purdon et al. [9] reported that relative increase in low-frequency EEG power (< 1 Hz) is seen broadly across almost the whole scalp. Our findings are in line with this emphasizing that, while propofol-induced increase in low-frequency EEG power is seen in all channels, the power values are above average in the frontal channels regardless of the propofol infusion rate. Hence, considering the challenges related to signal-to-noise ratio of EEG recordings, our findings may even suggest the superiority of frontal channels in this assessment task. However, larger dataset is needed to validate this suggestion.",

One of the challenges is related to the confirmation of the genuineness of the slow wave activity. Several other phenomena may increase the low-frequency power causing possible misinterpretation of the signal. Epileptic and periodic activity, for example, are quite frequently seen in post-CA patients. In a recent study, Backman et al. reported that 32% of the CA patients treated with target temperature management in the ICU suffer from electrographic status epilepticus [18] . A major part of these are non-convulsive showing no clinical signs [19] . Fig. 3 Slow wave activity of four forehead channels and all 19 channels of full EEG cap in the groups of good and poor neurological outcome. Above, topographic distribution of low-frequency (< 1 Hz) EEG power representing the slow wave activity at different phases of the experiment is given for patients with good outcome (go) and poor outcome (po). The values represent medians calculated over the groups. Below, the average low-frequency EEG power during the experiment in the four forehead channels (fc) and all 19 channels (ac) is presented for patients with good and poor neurological outcome. The trends are the medians calculated over the groups. The vertical lines represent the first and third quartiles of the data Furthermore, periodic discharges often related to irreversible hypoxic brain damage [20] are a typical EEG finding in this patient group. Both epileptic activity and periodic discharges may affect the low-frequency power of EEG although not associated in any way to normal brain function like slow waves. The same applies to some of the non-neural signal sources such as ventilator and ECG artifacts. A reliable technology that automatically analyzes slow wave activity would need to remove these signal components that erroneously increase the low-frequency power of EEG. Considering the usage of only few forehead electrodes, the recognition and removal of erroneous signal components might be more challenging compared to when dealing with the recordings from full EEG cap.",

The small amount of patients included in this experimental pilot study prevents us from making any strong conclusions about the study results. The reliability of frontal electrodes in capturing propofol-induced slow wave activity should be confirmed in a wider study preferably including more than one study center to confirm the independence of the findings from ICU-specific practical issues. Furthermore, repeated or continuous EEG measurement should be applied to investigate how early after the CA slow waves can separate the patients with a good and with a poor outcome, and if the channels used have an impact on that. While the clinical protocol used in the current study including controlled exposure of the patient to different infusion rates of propofol is suitable in bringing out propofolinduced slow waves, it might not be suitable for clinical practice. Optimally, it should be possible to assess frontal slow waves during routine propofol administration used for the sedation of post-CA patients during temperature management treatment which should be considered in the clinical protocols of upcoming studies. In addition, the sedation of these patients might not be maintained with only propofol but include the co-administration of benzodiazepines and opiates, for example. The effect of these additional drugs on frontal slow waves should be investigated as well. To assess in more detail what is the sufficient effect-site concentration of propofol to produce enough slow wave activity to differentiate poor and good outcome groups, one could also apply target controlled infusion instead of fixed infusion rates in the study protocol.",
