            "text": "Translational medicine is a roller coaster with occasional brilliant successes and a large majority of failures. Lost in Translation 1 ('LiT1'), beginning in the 1950s, was a golden era built upon earlier advances in experimental physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology, with a dash of serendipity, that led to the discovery of many new drugs for serious illnesses. LiT2 saw the large-scale industrialization of drug discovery using high-throughput screens and assays based on affinity for the target molecule. The links between drug development and university sciences and medicine weakened, but there were still some brilliant successes. In LiT3, the coverage of translational medicine expanded from molecular biology to drug budgets, with much greater emphasis on safety and official regulation. Compared with R&D expenditure, the number of breakthrough discoveries in LiT3 was disappointing, but monoclonal antibodies for immunity and inflammation brought in a new golden era and kinase inhibitors such as imatinib were breakthroughs in cancer. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to revive the LiT1 approach by using phenotypic assays and closer links with academia. LiT4 faces a data explosion generated by the genome project, GWAS, ENCODE and the 'omics' that is in danger of leaving LiT4 in a computerized cloud. Industrial laboratories are filled with masses of automated machinery while the scientists sit in a separate room viewing the results on their computers. Big Data will need Big Thinking in LiT4 but with so many unmet medical needs and so many new opportunities being revealed there are high hopes that the roller coaster will ride high again.",

            "text": "This article is a broad brush, personal review of the evolution of translational medicine over the past 60 years and a glimpse into its future. Translational medicine has many different meanings, ranging from re-branding of the clinical component of clinical pharmacology to the whole ebb and flow of discovery from science to patient care and back. The NIH definition of translational research visualizes it as a bidirectional flow in which research findings are moved to and from the researcher's laboratory to the patient's bedside (Zerhouni, 2005) . The MD Anderson slogan from 'bench to bedside and back' is similar but more concise. Neither fully conveys the multidisciplinary environment from chemists to physicianscientist and on to widespread use in the community, although the NIH gets close. At least six other disciplines, sharing fully in a drug development project, are needed to fulfil the hope of translating an idea into a useful therapeutic agent. Nor do they grasp how much the world of drug discovery and development, for both science and medicine, has changed over the last 60 years and is still changing. The very high incidence of failures >90-95% illustrates the complexity and difficulty at every stage. This article attempts to examine how translational medicine has progressed and stumbled over this period and the challenges it faces in the future. A better way of defining translational medicine might be 'from basic science to maintenance of good health'.",

            "text": "To many people, translational medicine conjures up a picture of a physician being given a supply of a new medicine from a pharmaceutical company to conduct a clinical trial to test for activity in a disease. Interaction between pharmaceutical R&D and physicians in clinical practice has never been quite as informal as that, but during the rapid expansion of drug discovery in the late 1950s, direct contact between drug discovery teams and picked clinical investigators was the norm. It was a remarkably successful period and one that is called, in this article, 'Lost in Translation 1, (LiT1) the Golden Years.' It has important lessons. The second period, LiT2, with the subtitle, 'Genes, automation and brickdust', was one of the rapid expansions by the pharmaceutical industry. It saw the birth of highly automated high-throughput screening (HTS) of millions of molecules, more detailed regulatory review, the spread of clinical trials throughout the world and the growth of very large contract research organizations. There were successes from this approach but fewer than had been anticipated and the costs soared. Direct contact between industrial research teams and the clinical investigators carrying out trials, even early phase trials, waned. Translational medicine now progressed through a complex of industrial, regulatory, international review board/ethics committee, contract research organizations (CRO) and clinical bureaucracy and, most recently, drug purchasing agencies. It was more like a children's game of pass the parcel than a translation. An important loss was that physicians in industry writing trial protocols often had little direct personal experience of the conduct of trials and the clinical investigators in the field had less and less contact with the detailed, and high quality, scientific work done in industry. This was particularly unfortunate for early phase studies that industry often called, 'Proof of Concept'. While automation of compound discovery in LiT2 was very disappointing, there were still major positives, particularly kinase inhibitors and breakthrough medicines for HIV. The third phase, LiT 3, was launched with major successes with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and a flood of 'Big Data' genomic and biomarker scientific information. These advances have been counterbalanced by increasing concerns about the cost of medicines and critical assessment of benefit-risk value by the government agencies that purchase them. These problems should be manageable, but if they are not, we may stumble into LiT4 in a vast cloud of new data that have not led to the medical advances that might have been achieved.",

            "text": "The key decision in drug discovery is the choice of a drug target. The way of choosing and interacting with the target for a medicine has shown enormous changes over the past 60 years, but the central role of the target has not. The factors that must now be considered under the heading translational medicine range from chemistry through protein therapeutics, biology, medicine, patients, adherence to medicines, regulators, purchasers and the rising importance of Big Data. It starts simple and becomes increasingly complicated as LiT passes from stage 1 to 4. The choice of target remains the pivot, but it may be a pathway or a control system, not a single molecule. The concept that translational medicine starts when the pre-clinical teams offers a molecule for testing for the first time in human (FTIH) and ends when it is marketed as no longer appropriate. Translational medicine in the LiT3 era begins with the choice of target, not with FTIH and does not end until many years later when both physicians and patients have understood how to use it safely and effectively in the real world.",

            "text": "In the golden years of drug discovery, from the 1950s to the late 1970s, the targets were often GPCRs, or their agonists. Physiologists had already shown that a number of agonists had an important role in organ function, for example, noradrenaline, angiotensin II, histamine, dopamine and 5-HT. Drug molecules often began as analogues of known agonists. From this work grew most of the antihypertensive, antidepressants and antimetabolites, among others. The contribution of scientists like James Black, George Hitchings and Paul Janssen (Van Gestel and Schuermans, 1986; Black, 1996; Hitchings, 2003) was massive but the earlier work of cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal physiologists and biochemists often gave them important clues about tissues to use for assays in drug development and the potential clinical uses. A major advantage was that it was possible to measure an effect on BP, airway resistance, gastric acid secretion and white blood cells in pre-clinical species and in man within a short time after administering the drug. There were also great advances in antibiotics with \u03b2-lactams, streptomycin, etc. This is not to underestimate the very close personal collaboration possible between chemistry (C), biology (B) and medicine (M) that was greatly valued by all parties and created a spirit of intense motivation and excitement. Translation is always easier if you can see the road ahead and test it, sometimes in a small-scale, carefully designed and documented, clinical study. A simple way of expressing that for teaching is by the following formula:",

Rapid advances in pharmacology and medicinal chemistry provided the tools to begin subdividing agonist and antagonist responses. In 1948, Ahlquist (1948) suggested a subdivision of \u03b2-adrenoceptors but he had great difficulty in getting his work published. It was developments in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology in the 1960s and 1970s that made it possible to test a wide range of agonists and antagonists on different tissues. Differences in the rank order of responses in different tissues provided strong evidence for the presence of different receptors. This enabled James Black and his team to produce selective antagonists for cardiac \u03b2-receptors and for gastric histamine receptors. In doing so, they aided patients with angina pectoris and virtually abolished surgical treatment of peptic ulcers. These successes had such a radical effect in transforming clinical medicine that the terms of reference of drug discovery in the Golden Years also had to change. It was the birth of very large outcome trials.",

In 1950, the most severe form of hypertension (grade IV or malignant hypertension) had the same life expectancy as lung cancer. Following the work of Paton and Zaimis with pentamethonium and hexamethonium in 1950, Sir Horace Smirk in New Zealand treated 53 patients with very severe hypertension with these ganglion blocking drugs, for periods of 2-14 months (Doyle, 1991) . He reported dramatic reversal of some of the most severe clinical features and this was the trigger for discovery after discovery of new and better tolerated, BP lowering agents for the next 20 years. From that followed progressive extension of treatment to less severe elevations of BP. This culminated in the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial in mild hypertension that began in 1973 and was published in 1985 and had nearly 80 000 patient-years of treatment. The principal result was a marked reduction of stroke, 60 in the treated group and 109 in the placebo group (Medical Research Council Working Party, 1985) . Today, hypertension is usually managed successfully by family doctors and the most severe forms have virtually disappeared in developed countries.",

            "text": "The statins were a serendipitous discovery by the Japanese microbiologist, Akira Endo, in a fermentation broth of Penicillium citrinum while seeking novel antibacterial compounds. The active substance, 'compactin', had no antibacterial activity but was a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis. Compactin lowered cholesterol in several species but not in the rat. It was developed by Sankyo in Japan and used in patients who were heterozygotes for familial hypercholestrolaemia. In 1978, Merck Research Laboratories found another potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase in a fermentation broth of Aspergillus terreus. This was named mevinolin, later the official name was lovastatin (Tobert, 2003) . Sankyo ran into safety problems with compactin in 1980 and Merck discontinued their clinical work for 2 years because of the close resemblance of lovastatin to the structure of compactin. When the studies restarted, lovastatin demonstrated large reductions of LDLcholesterol but there was controversy about safety and only limited uptake for clinical use. The turning point was the Scandinavian Simvasatin Survival Study (4S). For over 5.4 years of treatment in 4444 patients, 28% of patients on placebo had a major coronary event and only 19% on simvastatin (P < 0.00001) (Pedersen et al., 1998) . The major safety problem with statins is rhabdomyolysis and one, cerivastatin, was withdrawn due to the number of serious events including deaths. An expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for the gene glycine amidinotransferase that encodes the ratelimiting enzyme in creatinine synthesis has been identified as a marker of simvastatin-induced myopathy. This locus was associated with incidence of statin-induced myotoxicity in two separate populations (Mangravite et al., 2013) . Many statins are transported into the liver by the organic acid transporter, OATP1B1, and a reduction in function polymorphism increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis (Romaine et al., 2010) .",

The arthritis was relieved by the much more potent acetyl derivative, and for pain, the rest is history (Vane et al., 1990) . Initial estimates by Bayer were sales of less than 100 kg\u00b7per year. Aspirin production today is estimated to be about 50 000 tons\u00b7per year. Much later, academic investigators discovered the effect of aspirin in reducing platelet aggregation by inhibiting Tx formation (Weiss et al., 1968) and even later demonstrated that low doses of aspirin were sufficient to maintain an anti-thrombotic effect because platelets could not resynthesize the COX enzyme (Patrono et al., 1980) . The largescale simple trials pioneered by Peto and Collins played a large part in demonstrating the value of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events (Hennekens et al., 1989; Baigent et al., 1998) , but in primary prevention, the benefitrisk results were more equivocal due to the incidence of gastrointestinal and cerebral bleeding (Bartolucci et al., 2011) .",

Aplastic anaemia with chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone led to their withdrawal or severe limitations on their use in the mid-1970s. Severe liver toxicity with halothane on second exposure, suggesting an immune mechanism, was a major concern and attracted increasing attention from anaesthetists and hepatologists (Neuburger and Kenna, 1987) . The thalidomide crisis in 1961-1962 led to much greater emphasis on safety assessment both preclinically and clinically. The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) was founded in 1963. The early warning cards the CSM circulated were coloured yellow, as a reminder to doctors that liver toxicity was a relatively common adverse effect of drug treatment (Dunlop, 1977) . This was the start of regulatory review of protocols and safety data before administration of new drugs to man that was to become progressively more complex with time. Pre-clinical and clinical, safety organizations in industry were greatly expanded. Small-scale, interpersonal, translational medicine, 1950s and 1960s style, withered. A mighty engine was to replace it.",

The chemists working on 'hit to lead' and 'lead optimization' were more likely to add groups than subtract them. The end result was often a highly lipohilic, high MW molecule with very low water solubility at the pH of the small intestine. Experience showed that such molecules are difficult to develop for a number of reasons, including low bioavailability because of low water solubility and a substantial failure rate in pre-clinical toxicology and clinical safety assessment due to off-target effects. Developing a drug molecule to a point where it can be administered to a human for the first time involved many disciplines: hit to lead and medicinal chemistry, scale-up chemistry to simplify syntheses, biology, pharmacology and bioassay development, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, and safety assessment in more than one pre-clinical species.

They are very competent at following a protocol but largely prevented industry and drug discovery scientists and physicians from gaining practical experience. The pharmaceutical industry staff writing protocols often had limited personal experience of conducting early studies in man and very limited contact with the investigators undertaking them. Larger and larger clinical trials, some including tens of thousands of patients, required more and more study centres in more and more countries. This involved an assumption that a disease under study with the same diagnostic label in different countries is almost identical to the disease in the USA, Western Europe or Japan, where almost all new drugs originate. This premise also involves an unstated assumption that drug response and metabolism (Daly, 2012) and background medical care are very similar throughout the world, but this is not always true. Research on idiosyncratic drug toxicity has shown strong relationships to specific human leucocyte antigen (HLA) groups (Spraggs et al., 2012) and the frequency of the many different HLA groups varies around the world. The problems of developing a worldwide safety and efficacy profile of a new medicine are usually manageable but they are an additional source of variability in drug efficacy and safety. Despite all these problems, the industry still managed to produce some very important new medicines in LiT2.",

Ageing patients with damaged or failing organs, or malignant tumours, began to dominate the search for new targets.

One of the most important advances during this period was the discovery, analysis and classification of the role of protein kinases on critical signalling pathways within cells (Manning et al., 2002; Hunter, 2009) . The kinome posed a major challenge to medicinal chemists as their target was the ATP binding pocket that is highly conserved in the human protein kinase family (Liao, 2007; Muller, 2009 ). It is a great credit to medicinal chemistry that it proved possible to produce reasonably selective low MW inhibitors of these kinases, although the degree of specificity that was possible in designing small molecules to interact with GPCRs has rarely been achieved with kinase inhibitors. Kinase inhibitors have become very important in therapeutics starting with imatinib and progressing through several VEGF inhibitors, the serine/threonine-protein kinase B (BRAF) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors in patients with malignant melanoma patients with tumours with the V600E mutation in BRAF and most recently the Janus kinases JAK1 to JAK 3. A major contribution to translational medicine with kinase inhibitors was the measurement of target phosphoproteins in tumour biopsies. Without this information, it was necessary to carry out clinical trial lasting months, with the endpoint being reduction of tumour size on a radiograph using the relatively crude method known as RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumours).",

The remarkably rapid progress achieved was due to two main factors: (i) intensive efforts across the pharmaceutical industry, leading, later, to collaborations in developing highly active drug combinations and (ii) availability of rapid virus genome sequencing to track new mutations. HIV-1 genome sequences are critical for the discovery of drug-resistant mutations and play an important part in clinical trials (Gall et al., 2012) . High-throughput deep sequencing of the HIV genome has been used to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 during the early stages of acute infection (Henn et al., 2012) . The use of massively parallel sequencing of small samples to reveal the whole genome of the infecting agent is an important step forward in translational medicine that has potential applications well beyond HIV virology, for example, the SARS virus and H7N9 influenza, vaccine production, epidemiology and oncology (Malboeuf et al., 2012) .",

The HGP concentrated on the 3.3% of the human genome that codes for proteins and ENCODE (about 20% of the remainder) that has opened a vision of the very complex processes by which the protein coding sequences are controlled by transcription factors, enhancers, etc. ENCODE will provide an opportunity to re-run genome-wide association studies by linking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), associations to transcription factor sites and locus control regions that are sometimes >300 kb from the gene's promoter. For translational medicine, ENCODE has the potential to yield the greatest insights when it comes to modifying disease processes, provided that the mass of data can be interpreted. ENCODE is not the whole story as there is another 40% of the genome that is transcribed but whose function is not known. There have been critical reviews of the ENCODE project (Graur et al., 2013) but the basic premise that the regulation of the protein coding region lies with large regions of the genome outside the coding region has been established.",

Their affinity for targets is often two logs more than equivalent low MW drugs. mAbs are glycoproteins, usually of the IgG family, with a MW of about 150 kDa and are made up of two heavy and two light chains. The 'Y'-shaped structure is joined at the hinge region by a number of disulphide bonds at the junction of the Fab (fragment antigen binding) and Fc (fragment crystallizable) domains. The antigen-binding sites on the Fab domain are known as complimentarity-determining regions made up of six polypeptide segments.

The mouse antigen was a substantial disadvantage for use in man because of immunological reactions to the foreign (non-human) protein, formation of human anti-mouse mAb antibodies and a relatively short half-life. These problems were minimized by creating chimeric mAbs by grafting the antigen-specific variable domain of a mouse mAb onto the constant domains of a human antibody using biopharmaceutical techniques. This technology did not entirely overcome the problem of anti-mAb antibodies in man and the next step was to graft only the hypervariable, target antigen specific, region from a mouse antibody onto a human antibody framework. This further reduced the antigenicity, but immunogenicity in man remained a problem. The final step was to create fully humanized mAbs using phage display technology and transgenic mouse strains expressing human antibody domains (McCafferty et al., 1990; Lonberg et al., 1994) . Although more attention has been given to the hypervariable regions, the Fc domain has also been modified to vary the half-life of the molecule and modify the engagement with the Fc \u03b3-receptor on immune cells. Partly or fully humanized mAbs now dominate therapeutic antibody development in many areas of immunology.",

Native IgG antibodies have a half-life of 20-30 days, an attractive property of molecules that have to be administered parenterally. In the absence of target-mediated clearance, mAbs have a similar long half-life. mAbs are largely restricted to the plasma space because of their size and resulting slow diffusion. Antibodies and albumin are taken up through cell membranes by pinocytosis into vesicles where they bind to the MHC-related Fc receptor, FcRn. Binding to FcRn largely protects these proteins from intracellular catabolic degradation in the acidic endosome and allows recycling and release at the cell surface. Mutations introduced to enhance the Fc binding of the mAb to FcRn in the acidic endosome have been used to prolong antibody catabolic half-life. mAbs show a substantial amount of PK variability and a major factor is target-mediated clearance when the target is on a cell surface (Berinstein et al., 1998) . The initial dose is cleared rapidly as it binds to the target but a subsequent dose may have a much longer half-life because most of the target antigen sites are already occupied by first dose. Various measures have been investigated to alter both catabolic and target-mediated clearance, for example, by altering the isoelectric point of the mAb molecule. mAbs can themselves be immunogenic even in a fully humanized form. If they generate neutralizing anti-mAb antibodies, this can lead to reduction of efficacy. Systemic reactions to the infusion are usually manageable with antihistamines \u00b1 corticosteroids, often given prophylactically. Neutralizing antibodies are sought routinely in drug development but assays are quite difficult in the presence of an excess of unbound mAb. The first clue may be diminished activity in clinical use.",

Advances in medicinal chemistry have also made it easier to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) chiral molecules to increase structural diversity in screens. Substantial improvements in MS and NMR techniques have made it much easier to verify structures.

A recent paper from Pfizer set out three pillars of survival for a compound that is being developed as a medicine: (i) achieving sufficient concentration at the site of action; (ii) target binding; and (iii) expression of functional pharmacological activity. Pfizer investigated compound failures in man and found that 42% failed to achieve those three objectives so the reason for failure was never fully established (Morgan et al., 2012) .

Many human diseases progress slowly over years, and as the condition evolves, different features appear. Environmental effects may be more important than genetics. Tissue inflammation may progress through different cell types and ultimately to fibrosis, for example, cirrhosis and advanced renal disease. Cardiovascular hypertrophy may be infiltrated by fibrosis and even calcification and become irreversible. It is very difficult to replicate either the aetiology (in many cases multifactorial in man) or the temporal evolution in a laboratory animal model. From a biologist's standpoint, disease models are the mainstay of their evidence to take a candidate molecule the next major step towards man. In so doing, they are likely to optimize their assays by selecting the species and circumstances that show the largest effect with the molecule under investigation. This assay selection bias is not intended to mislead but can lead to difficulty in reproducibility in other laboratories. There are also time constraints in this type of research so an animal model of osteoarthritis may be induced in weeks, whereas in man, the condition evolves over many years and the usefulness of the animal model for inferences to man is questionable. The use of SCID mice with transplanted human tumours is widespread in oncology research but the correlation with human response has substantial limitations.

This is the time for a full review of all the available data, not just pre-clinical safety and pharmacology, but predicted pharmacokinetics including peak concentration and clearance, bioavailability, plasma protein binding, human dose, metabolic routes and the enzymes involved, tissue distribution including possible role of transporters and likely paths of elimination. It is a great help if these features can be built into a mathematical model. The initial dose will be based on calculations based on preclinical safety findings (no adverse effect level, NOAEL) and target engagement (minimal anticipated biological effect level, MABEL). Since the TGN1412 disaster, there has been particularly close attention to actions that might trigger an immunological chain reaction and strict review of any mechanism that might have that potential (Brennan et al., 2010) . FTIH studies are usually conducted in healthy volunteers with limited objectives, mainly safety and PK, although where possible measurements of a pharmacodynamic effect should be included. The PK modelling predictions should take into account high variability with poorly soluble drug variations in pre-systemic metabolism, plasma clearance and protein binding., and if they do not fit with human data, the model coefficients will need revision. From the PK, a calculation of target engagement and predicted magnitude of the pharmacodynamic effects over the range of exposures that are planned should be made. A model purely of PK is of limited value. For receptors and enzyme antagonists/inhibitors, a high degree of target engagements may be needed to produce a measureable pharmacodynamic effect, but for an agonist effect on receptors, only a small proportion may need to be engaged to produce a maximal response. Safety has become a dominant consideration in planning for FTIH, and a major factor in subsequent studies, for all but the most critical illnesses and even there it is the subject of very careful review.",

The TGN1412 disaster (Blanas et al., 2006) is a constant reminder of the need for the utmost care, particularly in the early stages of administration of a new drug. The buzz words in safety parlance are risk-benefit, risk mitigation and risk management and they mean far more than just a warning note in the product label. It means, specifying the acceptable dose-exposure range, monitoring for predictable toxicity based on pre-clinical findings or known effects of the pharmacology and a strategy for managing adverse events if they occur. Patients consent must include a full explanation of risks and, critically, signs or symptoms that may require them to seek clinical advice urgently. This often means stopping treatment, or changing doses and reporting adverse events to regulatory agencies and drug developers. The FDAapproved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) is currently the most comprehensive (Food and Drug Administration, 2013). The EMA has a similar pharmacovigilance programme with the abbreviation ERMS. When serious adverse reaction reports are returned by investigators for cardiac or liver issues, it is GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) practice to send by return an email with a detailed questionnaire to help understand the event and its connection to the clinical trial treatment.

The aim of safety monitoring in man is to anticipate and detect adverse effects at an early stage. Both on-and off-target effects in pre-clinical species need careful review. The safety margin in pre-clinical species should be >10-fold (some would argue 100-fold) for the onset of potentially serious organ damage and even that may not be acceptable if there is no sensitive method for monitoring the effect in man, for example, seizures and pancreatitis. Route of administration, dose, potential for formation of reactive metabolites, the main routes of elimination measured in animals and predicted for man must all be reviewed. Possible effects of an overdose and the time it takes for the main pharmacological effect to wane should be evaluated. The latter is particularly an issue with mAbs that may maintain an effect for 3-4 months. mAbs that suppress immune function may lead to reactivation of the EB and JC viruses.

It is highly desirable to separate PoP from PoT for clarity of thinking if problems develop and, more generally, to construct a response surface that includes desirable and undesirable actions. Without quantitative evidence of a human pharmacological action, it is difficult to progress to PoT with any confidence of success. Too often the highest doses are carried forward to maximize the chances of a therapeutic response with little regard to the symptom burden and safety issues that may be carried with it. In oncology, the concept of maximum-tolerated dose is still sometimes used. It is very important to obtain a good dose/exposure response curve over the safe PK and pharmacodynamic range.

The simplest measures of pharmacodynamic effects in man are when there is a readily measureable physiological response such as slowing of the heart rate with a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, or sedation with an orexin antagonist. For accessible targets with a measureable response, agonist challenge can provide a useful way of evaluating an antagonist, for example, reduction of an i.d. antigen weal and flare in an atopic individual given an oral antihistamine to parenteral LPS challenge to study a potent systemic anti-inflammatory agent. Tissues such as white blood cells, skin, endoscopic or operative tissue samples are very useful for human pharmacology if they express the target molecule. Increasing emphasis on assays with human tissue is a very useful cross-check on IC50 or the EC50 assays with cell lines expressing the human target protein.

Some symptoms are common, for example, headache, often ascribed to caffeine deprivation, but others such as sedation, sleep disturbance, inattention, nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and unusual fatigue are early clues to a pharmacodynamic effect. These concerns are often not reported by patients or by carers and adverse reaction reports greatly underestimate them.

            "text": "Some of the most commonly studied biomarkers in translational medicine are the cytokines and chemokines released during inflammation and these have become very important drug targets and indicators of pharmacological activity. Initially, these relied on immunoassays that were not always completely specific but immunoasays have improved and are being replaced, in many cases, by MS assays with much higher specificity. The targets are too many to list but they range from the traditional C-reactive protein through TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN and chemokines (O'Shea and Murray, 2008) . The first to be widely used in medicine were antibodies directed against TNF in rheumatoid arthritis. The results were excellent in many patients, but complete resolution of the disease was not common and about a third of patients do not respond. Interventions with different mAbs on TNF cytokine or its receptor may have different mechanistic effects (Tracey et al., 2008) . Cytokine responses are often pleiotropic and the full range of activity of a cytokine such as IL-6 was only discovered as mAbs were developed against the cytokine and its receptor and used to treat human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Feldmann and Maini, 2010; Kishimoto, 2010) . A new range of cytokine-related drug targets are the JAKs that bind to the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane-cytokine receptors and signal by the STATS Pathway (Okamoto and Kobayashi, 2011) . Chemokines are a particularly complex area. More than 50 different chemokines and 20 different chemokine receptors have been cloned but their pleiotropic effects make study of single agent interventions very difficult (Ratajczak et al., 2006) .",

A good example is the use of troponin I (cTnI) as a marker of myocardial injury. It is very well-validated clinically in acute coronary syndromes or myocardial infarction and in pre-clinical safety assessment.

Intervention on single factors such as LDL cholesterol or high BP has had great successes but many diseases have not responded adequately, and pathway analysis and identification of multiple points of intervention seems likely to be the way forward. Many common diseases are already treated with multi-drug combinations, such as most cancers, tuberculosis, HIV and type II diabetes. The days of seeing a Paul Ehrlich magic bullet aimed at single disease target are not over but an era of pre-designed, multi-drug treatment is the way forward for translational medicine. We are not lost in translation but it will need new ways of thinking about control systems and pathways in logical and authenticated multi-component treatment regimens.",

Adaptive designs can, in principle, allow the dose to be optimized as the trial progresses. Bayesian trials are being used more often as the 'priors' can be updated as a study progresses. Large, simple, Pero-esque trials have an important role but their main application falls late in development when the drug is in extensive use.

Advocates of the 'omics' would like to see biomarkers accepted as regulatory endpoints for product licensing but, even if that happens, it is almost certain that purchasers will continue to insist on hard clinical endpoints to which they can attach value in cash terms. Breakthroughs dominate the headlines, but purchasers need to have more understanding about the incremental nature of many medical advances, splendidly narrated in Siddhartha Mukherjee's biography of cancer 'The Emperor of All Maladies' (2010). Purchasers, and in consequence, drug developers pay a lot of attention to matters like once a day dosing with a 24 h PK profile, but limited attention to the patient value of developing medicines with similar pharmacology but a worthwhile reduction in side effects. Purchasers appear not to put much value on reducing the symptom burden of many therapeutic agents unless they are severe.

Drugs tested in one situation may prove to have value in another, for example, the thalidomide derivative lenalidomide used in multiple myeloma. If attempts to subdivide patients with common diseases into responsive and non-responsive groups succeed, personalized medicine will grow. Early hopes from the HGP have not had much impact but the explosive growth of new information about the control of body systems through 'omics' and ENCODE should strengthen it. There will have to be some adjustment of regulatory and purchaser outlooks. Medicines that are as effective but more convenient to take and cause a much lower burden of symptomatic side effects than existing therapy need greater recognition. For older patients, swallowing a large tablet may be much more difficult than a small one. It is often the case that it is only when a new medicine is on the market for a lengthy period that its benefits and risks become clearer. Would earlier marketing be permitted if the country concerned had a fully operational electronic health care record system that would allow risk-benefit data about a new drug to be continuously updated. Would purchasers be willing to adjust the initial premium price down if it did not deliver the degree of hoped for benefit or upward if it delivered unexpectedly good results?",

Drug developers, prescribing physicians and their patients share responsibility for this situation. The social-medicine component of the problem is epitomized by the low adherence to medications of patients who are depressed. The hazard ratio of poor adherence was 1.76 based on the response to a simple patient completed question about being depressed (Grenard et al., 2011) .

Poor adherence has been reported in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Nelson et al., 2006) . Much higher adherence rates have been reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but in the original MRC tuberculosis trial, that used streptomycin and PAS, random home visits checking PAS in urine showed a positive result in only half the patients although all had been warned of the risk of not taking their medication regularly. This was probably because of the very large capsules of PAS and the attendant gastrointestinal side effects. Assessment of adherence is difficult as patients report higher figures than independent verification demonstrates, such as the interval between refilling their prescription at a pharmacy. Poor adherence adversely affects cardiovascular outcome, after a myocardial infarction (Choudhry and Winkelmayer, 2008) . While many adherence failures are unrelated to drug side effects, certain drugs with relatively severe side effects such as HAART for HIV, some oncology drugs that cause severe symptoms such as diarrhoea and antidepressants that impair male sexual function do have adverse effects on adherence (Grenard et al., 2011) . Although there is less published information about mild to moderate symptoms, there is little doubt that they also contribute to poor adherence, for example, with tamoxifen adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (Partridge et al., 2003) that has recently revived concern in British newspapers.",

A few projects will be performed entirely in silico but most will iterate between laboratory and clinical experimental data and computer modelling of systems and pathways. Projects like ENCODE have great potential in physiology, pharmacology and medicine to map transcription factor sites in different tissues in health and disease but they, inevitably, generate enormous amounts of data in genome-wide scans. The problem is that although the coding part of the genome is basically the same in all nucleated body cells, the transcription factor profile is different in the large number of different human body cell types (>400) both in a normal physiological state and even more in abnormal situations.

Unfortunately, many 'historic' documents (more than 10 years old) lack clear summaries and important information such as detailed information on protocols, assay methods, and trial endpoints and adverse reaction reports. If they still exist, they may be filed in different places.

In many diseases, most cancers, dementias, arthritides, psychosis, the current therapeutic interventions are either ineffective or delivered at a stage when extensive tissue malfunction has occurred, much of it not reversible. The stages of many chronic diseases have a big effect on response to different kinds of pharmacology and need more attention in drug development. The pressure now is to move to earlier interventions. Pharmacology already plays an important role in preventive medicine. The increase in life expectancy in the past decade is owed much to the control of BP and lowering of LDL-cholesterol and are examples of preventive pharmacology as is the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction. For medicine, there are major challenges in detecting disease at a very early stage, predicting progression and measuring an indicative response to an intervention in a relatively short period of time. Clinical trials that might take 10 years to reach an endpoint face challenging problems of cost, adherence to medication and administrative sustainability. Medicines intended for this early stage also have onerous requirements for safety and only a very low incidence and severity of symptomatic side effects would be acceptable. In diseases of long duration, the factors that currently maintain the illness may not be the same as those that initiated it. The translational medicine of early intervention needs a lot of original thinking. The key is better understanding of the factors initiating and maintaining human illness, which must be a top priority. The environment for early onset translational medicine is challenging but fortunately there are still some exciting opportunities.",

Drugs that have been marketed with very limited expectation have sometimes succeeded beyond all predictions. Bayer aspirin was only expected to sell about 60 kg a year when it was introduced. The reverse has happened on many occasions when great expectations about a new medicine have not been fulfilled. Decisions on licensing are based on the available RCT results that may include 10 000 or more carefully selected patients, most of them supervised by investigators who offer a good standard of medical care. Patient-years of exposure in RCTs will be substantially smaller even with drugs that are intended for very long-term use. Such studies may not predict real-world experience accurately where prescribing decisions, patient behaviour and the prevailing standard of medical care are much more variable. One solution is to employ 'large simple' RCTs with broad inclusion criteria, large numbers of events, minimal data requirements and robust endpoints, with electronic registries or health records to track patients. Another approach is to use 'cluster-based' randomization: clinics, nursing homes, schools are randomly selected to receive or not receive an intervention. A third approach is to use 'Point of care' randomization that embeds research into routine clinical care. Enrolment, follow-up and clinical event data are all collected within the context of their routine care (R. Horwitz, pers. comm.). Such randomized studies in the community can achieve a much closer approach to real-word practice than standard RCTs (although they are unlikely to replace them) and are much easier to interpret than purely observational studies without randomization.",

Industry has concerns, with some reason, that information from poorly informed searches of very complex files will be quoted selectively and cause a great deal of additional work.

If there are concerns about safety of an individual product or a class effect, further large-scale, costly, trials may be required after registration. Approval by a major regulatory agency, although critically important, is only a step towards a much more important step, will purchasing agencies agreed to pay for it?",

            "text": "Much of the cost of medicines in advanced countries is borne by taxpayers or insurers. Instead of an individual medical doctor choosing what medicines are available to his or her patients, national or regional purchasing agencies decide what they are willing to provide out of the available budget. A number of common diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, are reasonably well managed with current treatments. There is still room for improvement but the threshold is high and purchasers will only pay a non-generic price if the new treatment has demonstrated a worthwhile incremental advantage in the improvement of health. They are the judges of what is a worthwhile increment. Agencies such as the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence evaluate cost-benefit, with a major emphasis on improvement in quality adjusted life years (QUALY). The maximum acceptable cost is said to be about \u00a330 000 (ca. US $50 000) per QUALY, with only a few exceptions. Translational medicine achievements are translated into currency by both purchasers and pharmaceutical companies, although using rather different formulae. Meanwhile, the cost of developing new medicines threatens to outpace the rate of discovering them. The most exciting developments in recent years, mAbs, have also proved to be among the most expensive. To sustain research and development of new medicines, still much needed, the costs will have to be reduced, particularly of regulatory requirements and large clinical trials. In principle, both are possible if large simple trials based on communities with electronic health records become the norm with efficacy and safety data becoming available for analysis in real time.",

            "text": "Drug discovery over the last 60 years has had cyclical ups and downs and has become accustomed to the great majority of projects failing. Almost all the major developments have been based on strong basic science, credible clinical evidence and advances in technology, but with single molecule targets. Many of the current major developments in basic and clinical science are based on applying very large data sets, GWAS, ENCODE, omics to complex pathways in biological control, disease aetiology and pathogenesis. The assumption is that many, perhaps most, of these will require multiple points of intervention, not single targets. Can translational medicine adapt to this new world? The answer must be, in principle, 'Yes' from an operational perspective. Unfortunately, there is a deeper layer of difficulty concerned with understanding the manipulation of control systems in the genome, the epigenome, and the complexity of protein to protein, cell to cell and organ to organism interactions. There are some powerful and specific tools in siRNAs, oligonucleotides, zinc-finger molecules and gene constructs. Most have already been used in clinical trials, for example, in some forms of inherited muscular dystrophy or immune deficiency, but the problems of delivering them in the right amount to the right cells, not most of them to the wrong cells or chromosomes, are formidable and their use may be limited to serious disease with no alternatives. Mipomersen, the first oligonucleotide approved by the FDA (for familial hypercholesterolaemia), was required to have a risk management strategy, because of limited safety information. The EMA refused approval because of liver safety concerns. We may have to depend, for some time, upon the tools we still have in small NMEs and mAbs for common diseases with multiplex aetiology until we devise new, and more precisely targeted, methods.",

The student gulped and replied, 'If I knew what I was going to discover next year I wouldn't wait until next year to discover it'. Translational medicine in LiT4 is a bit like a group of surfers riding The Great Wave Off Kanagawa by the famous Japanese artist, Katsushika Hokusai. All wear a swim vest emblazoned 'Translational Medicine' and in the lead are two with subtitles, 'Basic Pharmacology' and 'Clinical Pharmacology'. Riding the crest is enormously exhilarating but very challenging, and like the young PhD student, they are not quite sure what they are going to discover where or when the data tsunami throws them up on the beach. But some will ride the great wave to a happy landing and the progress of translational medicine will continue and prosper to the benefit of mankind.",
