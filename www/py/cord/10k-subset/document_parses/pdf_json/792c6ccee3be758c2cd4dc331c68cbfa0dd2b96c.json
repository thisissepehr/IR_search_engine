Although the activation of the contact system have been implicated in various types of human disease, in only a few instances is its role clearly defined. In the last 10 years, our understanding of the contact system, particularly its biology and (patho)physiology has greatly increased through investigations using gene-modified animal models.

This system consists of three serine proteinases: coagulation factors XII (FXII) and XI (FXI), and plasma prekallikrein (PK), and the nonenzymatic cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (HK) [1] . These plasma proteins were grouped together as the contact system, because they required contact with artificial, negatively charged surfaces for zymogen activation in vitro. Upon the activation of this system, it can trigger blood coagulation and is responsible for the generation of the proinflammatory products such as bradykinin. This system is also called as plasma kallikrein-kinin system, functioning in a few inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [2] .",

            "text": "Investigations of their biochemical and biologic properties have shown that the contact system proteins interact with a number of physiologic and pathophysiologic systems. The biological role of contact system is to initiate and participate in the pathophysiological responses to injury, mainly in the processes of coagulation and inflammation. The activation of this system has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of human disease states, including septicemia and endotoxemia, ARDS, DIC, typhoid fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Crohn's disease, transfusion reactions, renal allograft rejection, nephrotic syndrome, hereditary angioedema, and in extracorporeal circulation [1] . In animal models of sepsis, arthritis, and enterocolitis, the inhibitors of contact factor enzymes have modulated hypotension, inflammation or prolonged survival, suggesting the participation of this system in the host defense and innate immunity [3] . The contact system is evolutionarily conserved (deficiencies in contact factors are very rare), and the activation of the contact system have been implicated in various types of human disease, however, it currently still remains a mystery what its physiological function is in human. In the last 10 years, because of the studies using gene-modified animal models, our understanding of the contact system, particularly its physiology and pathophysiology, has greatly increased. In this review, we will first describe the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive contact activation on nonphysiological materials. Next, we will summarize the clues linking the contact system with coagulation and inflammation in health and disease, and will discuss recent findings from both fundamental and clinical studies on the contributions of contact system to cardiovascular, infectious, and inflammatory and autoimmune disease, and their potential to be target for treatment of both thrombotic and inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "In plasma, about 75% of PK circulates bound noncovalently to HK in 1:1 ratio, while the rest PK circulates freely. Besides PK, HK forms a heterodimer with factor XI, both of PK and FXI are surface bound via HK and share a conserved HK-binding site. The nonenzymatic cofactor HK is responsible for binding to negatively charged surfaces and assembly of these proteins forming a complex [1] . Once FXII is bound to surfaces, it undergoes conformational changes to become autoactivated (auto-activation), the activated FXIIa catalyzes the activation of PK. Meanwhile, FXII is increasingly susceptible to cleavage by plasma kallikrein (PK) and activated FXII (FXIIa) itself. Activated plasma kallikrein converts FXII into FXIIa (trans-activation), thereby forming an activation feedback loop, which overcomes inactivation of kallikrein and FXII by their counterpart inhibitors, such as C1-esterase inhibitor. In the absence of factor XII, prekallikrein does not become activated on an artificial surface. It is because of this finding that this system is called the contact system. In the early phase of contact activation, the independent binding ability of HK to the surface is limited. However, once PK and FXII are activated, single chain HK can be cleaved into two-chain HKa and release bradykinin. Compared with HK, HKa has greater capacity of binding to the surfaces and proinflammatory effect [4] . Moreover, Factor XI is activated in complex with HK and FXII, whereby the intrinsic pathway of coagulation is initiated. All these above information is accumulated from in vitro observations, how the contact system is activated in vivo has not been well-characterized.",

This assay is routinely used to evaluate defects in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, such as hemophilia A and B. Recent studies have identified endogenous activators of contact system, such as polyphospahte, collagen, misfolded protein aggregates, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), glycosaminoglycans, and nucleic acids [5] .

            "text": "The physiologic, negatively charged surface for contact system activation is actually the assembly of these proteins on biologic surfaces, ie, cell membranes [1] . The specific interactions with biologic membranes of endothelial cells, platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes indicate that assembly and activation of this system takes place in a physiologic milieu. Contact system proteins can assemble on cell membrane, via binding to their receptors and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of proteoglycans including heparan sulphate (HS) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) [12, 13] . Detailed investigations of the proteins of the contact system interacting with cells have led to understanding of how this system is physiologically active. The pivotal protein for contact system assembly on cell membranes is HK [14] . HK actually has three domains that fit into the putative kininogen receptor(s) on endothelial cells. Three receptors have been shown to mediate the binding of HK on cell surface, uPAR, gC1qR and cytokeratin-1 [1] . We have reported that HK binds to uPAR via its D5 in membrane rafts of endothelial cells [15] , and the D3 and D5 of HK stimulate monocytes via uPAR and Mac1 to produce cytokines and chemokines [16] . Besides healthy cells, apoptotic cells may also provide surface for assemble and activation of contact system [4] . Recently, we have reported that HK bridges uPAR on monocytes/macrophages and phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, leading to engulfment of apoptotic cells, and assembly and activation of contact system on apoptotic cell surface [4] . Because efferocytosis is essential for regulation of immune responses and tissue homeostasis, the involvement of HK in recognition and binding of apoptotic cells reveals a novel role of contact system in \"apoptotic\" innate immunity. Cell surface GAGs expose vast numbers of specific binding sites for contact system. HK and FXII bind with high affinity (K D \u2264 144 nM) to endothelial GAGs in the presence of zinc ions, thereby modulating contact systemdriven BK formation [17] .",

Coagulation is not only essential to maintain the integrity of a circulatory system (hemostasis), but also contribute to formation of blood clot leading to ischemia and tissue damage (thrombosis). Thrombosis is, triggered by the plasma coagulation system, leading to formation of fibrin. Fibrin formation is initiated by two distinct pathways, through exposure of blood to injured vessel walls (extrinsic) or to blood activation surfaces (intrinsic). When assembled on an activation surface, the contact system (FXII, PK and HK) becomes activated and stimulates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation by activating FXI. In addition, the contact systemmediated intrinsic coagulation pathway may crosstalk with extrinsic coagulation pathway. For example, the contact system of coagulation can be initiated either by the contact surface in plasma from women in late pregnancy or by micellar stearate added to plasma. With either of the contact surfaces, increase of factor VII coagulant activity (VIIc) and FXIIa depended on the potency of the contact surface [21] . The stearateinduced VIIc was inhibited by 60-70% in the presence of anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody and was absent in FXII-deficient plasma. The addition of purified human factor XII to this plasma restored the increase in VIIc. In FIX-deficient or FXI-deficient plasma, the stearateinduced increase in VIIc was greatly reduced, indicating that in the presence of contact surface the activation of contact system results in the activation of FVII [21] . In another in vitro study in which a FXI-dependent effect on clot formation initiated by tissue factor, FXI increased prothrombin activation and the fibrin formation rate, revealing a role for factor XI in the propagation of clot growth after tissue factor-dependent initiation [22] .",

Although the investigation of unique patients with deficiency or contact factors may contribute to our knowledge of their function, contact system deficiency is rare in humans and no controlled large clinical trial has correlated contact system deficiency and pathophysiology such as thrombotic/hemorrhagic disease. Instead, the role of contact system in thrombosis has been recently improved by the studies using animal models. Although the contact system has been considered to have no importance for hemostasis, studies using animal models show that thrombus formation is defective in deficient mice.

Indeed, the contact system is highly conserved among mammalian species. Besides, FXII-gene-deficient mice are protected from cerebral ischemia related to reduced fibrin formation in the microvasculature of the ischemic tissue, consistent with an essential role of FXII for thrombus formation in thromboembolic disease [25] . Mice lacking FXI are similarly protected from vessel occlusive fibrin formation [26] . Thus, the contact system is critical in pathologic clotting via the activation of intrinsic pathway [27] .

When polyP is intravenously applied, it activates FXII and leads to lethal pulmonary embolism in wild-type mice, which was prevented by either FXII-deficiency or FXII inhibitor, suggesting a critical role of contact system [6, 36] . Recombinant Ixodes ricinus contact phase inhibitor (Ir-CPI) is a Kunitz-type protein expressed by the salivary glands of the tick Ixodes ricinus, specifically interacts with activated human FXIIa, FXIa, and kallikrein and prolongs the aPTT in vitro [36] .

This raises the possibility that targeting contact system may serve as a strategy for prevention or treatment of pathological thrombosis, which has less risk of severe hemorrhage than currently used anti-coagulants [33] . For example, selective depletion of factor XII with antisense oligonucleotides attenuates catheter thrombosis in rabbits [33] . Inhibition of FXII activation using the peptide-based inhibitor PCK in mice also provides protection from cerebral ischemia, without causing excessive bleeding at a surgical injury site. Moreover, a recombinant infestin-4based inhibitor that specifically targets FXII activity provided protection from cerebral ischemia in experimental stroke models albeit did not affect the hemostatic capacity in inhibitor-treated mice [37] .",

Activation of plasminogen in vivo can reproducibly be studied by a short lasting infusion of desamino D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). Levi et al. found that the formation of plasmin upon the DDAVP stimulus as reflected by circulating plasmin-a2antiplasmin complexes was lower in FXII-deficient patients than in healthy volunteers, suggesting that activation of the contact system occurred after DDAVP infusion in healthy volunteers [38] . The plasminogen activating activity in normal plasma after infusion of DDAVP was only partially blocked (by two-third) with specific antibodies to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type PA. The residual activity could be quenched by an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against FXII and was absent in FXII-deficient patients [38] . Thus, activation of the contact system contributes to fibrinolysis. The impaired fibrinolytic activity in FXII deficient patients may explain the occurrence of thromboembolic complications in these patients. Patients deficient in factor XI suffer from abnormal bleeding. The Ashkenazi Jewish probands with severe FXI deficiency had an increased proportion of episodes of bleeding complications after surgery at sites with enhanced local fibrinolysis, such as the urinary tract, or during tooth extraction, suggesting that FXI plays a role in the downregulation of fibrinolysis [39] . In consistence with this hypothesis, systemic incorporation of anti-factor XI antibodies resulted in an almost twofold increase in endogenous fibrinolysis compared with a control antibody, indicating a novel role for the intrinsic pathway of coagulation [40] . In a static in-vitro coagulation model in which clotting is initiated in recalcified citrated plasma by tissue factor coated on the bottom of microtiter plates, when larger clots (200-300 microl plasma) were formed, FXI not only increased prothrombin activation and the fibrin formation rate but also inhibited fibrinolysis. Thus, in addition to enhancement of tissue factor-initiated coagulation, FXI inhibits fibrinolysis to stabilize the formed clot [22] .",

It has been known for a long time that the activation of this system produces a potent proinflammatory nona-peptide bradykinin (BK; Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg) through cleavage of HK by PK. Thus the contact system was also named plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Bradykinin and related kinins act on two types of receptors designated as B1R and B2R, both of which are G proteincoupled receptors. B2R is constitutively expressed in various vascular and non-vascular cells and rapidly desensitized. B1R is induced by inflammatory cytokines and resistant to desensitization. These bradykinin receptors are involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes. The mode of kinin actions are based upon the interactions between the kinin and their specific receptors, which can lead to activation of several second-messenger systems. During inflammatory reactions, activated leukocytes and endothelial cells express B1R, which is sensitive to bradykinin-derived peptides. When the kinin B2R is activated, vascular permeability increases, amongst others through NO-induced relaxation of perivascular smooth muscle cells. There is evidence that there is continuous FXII-dependent formation of bradykinin in vivo, as bradykinin levels are reduced by 50% in FXII-deficient mice. BK is rapidly degraded by a number of peptidases, including angiotensin-converting enzyme. As a result, therapeutic targeting of this peptidase elevates BK levels and is being held partially responsible for the blood-lowering effects of this commonly used therapy.",

            "text": "Vertebrate hosts control infection by rapidly mobilizing soluble and cellular-based microbicidal systems that destroy invading pathogens. Activation of the contact system is a major part of plasma host-defense systems and plays a crucial role as the first line in host defense against pathogens. A growing number of studies indicated that the contact system is important in host defense against infection by bacteria, parasitic protozoan, and virus [20, 41, 42] . As mentioned above, bacteria may activate the contact system directly through physical interaction, or indirectly by the releases such as proteases and polyP. Similarly to cell surface, contact system proteins bind to bacteria, directly mediating the assembly and activation of the contact system on bacterial surface [43] . Proteinases secreted from bacteria such as staphophains released from Staphylococcus aureus directly cleave HK. Some proteinases such as from Porphyromonas gingivalis indirectly cleave HK by proteolytic activation of FXII or PK [44] . Polyphosphate from bacteria also activates FXII, initiates BK formation and BK-mediated vascular leakage and induces pain sensations. Activation of contact system contributes to host defense against bacterial infection [43] . Both kallikrein and FXIIa activate the complement system, leading to killing of bacteria. Bradykinin may recruitment neutrophil and macrophages to the site of infection, and activate innate sentinel cells via the bradykinin receptor B2R pathway [45] . However, persistent bacteria-driven contact system activation may lead to pathological plasma kinin levels concomitant with consumption of contact factors. In patients, abundant production of BK may induce hypotension and vascular leak, exerting disadvantage effects and contributing to multiple organ failure. Indeed, in severe sepsis patients, the kinin system is activated as exemplified by elevated plasma bradykinin and consumption of prekallikrein and FXII. However, in a double-blind randomized multicenter study, a B2R antagonist showed no improvement in outcome in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis [46] . This result represents the complexity of the role of contact system in inflammatory cascades. Activation of contact system is also involved in parasite infection. Trypanosoma cruzi binds HK and cleaves HK by cruzipain, to liberate bradykinin, which is increased up to 35-fold in the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans [47] . The liberated kinins activate innate immunity by potently stimulating dendritic cell maturation via the B2R. However, excessive bradykinin leads to persistent parasitism in the edematous tissues. A recent study has shown that activation of contact system is also critical in virus-induced endothelial cell permeability [48] . Hantavirus infection causes vascular leakage due to alterations of the endothelial barrier. Incubation of plasma proteins with hantavirus-infected endothelial cells results in HK cleavage, increase in enzymatic activities of FXIIa and kallikrein and liberation of bradykinin, leading to dramatic increases in endothelial cell permeability [45] . Another virus HSV1 directly binds to FXII and mediates its activation in the presence of PK. An inhibitor of activated FXII, anti-FXII, anti-kallikrein and anti-FXI Abs inhibit HSV1-initiated clotting [20] . Thus virus can trigger and amplify coagulation through the contact phase and intrinsic pathway, suggesting an additional mechanism that contributes to vascular pathology in virus infection.",

Bradykinin receptor expression also increased in circulating and synovial neutrophils of RA patients. The concept that the KKS is important in the pathogenesis of arthritis is supported by the observations in animal models. Lewis rats have a mutation in HK (S511N) rendering it susceptible to cleavage by plasma kallikrein, the administration of streptococcal cell wall polymers peptidoglycan -polysaccharide (PG-PS) induces systemic inflammatory response including arthritis in Lewis rats, but not in other strains such as Buffalo and Fischer rats. Accompanied with synovitis and joint erosion in Lewis rats, there is a decrease in plasma prekallikrein and HK, likely due to consumption of the precursor proteins following KKS activation. A specific kallikrein inhibitor prevents arthritis and the systemic complications in the PG-PS model [49] . The Brown-Norway-Katholiek (B/ N/Ka) rat strain has a severe deficiency of both plasma kininogens (HK and LK) due to a single point mutation, Ala163Thr, which results in defective secretion of kininiogen from the liver. Kininogen-deficient rats on a Lewis genetic background exhibit attenuated acute and chronic inflammatory arthritis [50] , demonstrating that plasma HK is a key mediator of inflammatory diseases.",

A recent study by Song et al. demonstrated B2R deficiency did not attenuate arthritis in a mouse model of anti-collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) [52] .

First, the KKS components can enter synovial joint space either by transudation from the plasma or from degranulating neutrophils chemotactically attracted into the synovium. Excessive release of kinins in the synovial tissues may stimulate the synthesis of second wave of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and histamine) to enhance inflammatory joint disease. Upregulated expression of bradykinin receptors in joints may increase cytokine production. Second, upregulated bradykinin receptor expression in circulating monocytes may enhance systemic inflammation and their homing to inflamed synovial tissue. The expression of B1R in CAIA can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1\u03b2, IL-6, and likely occurs as part of an proinflammatory feedback mechanism. B1RB2R deficiency significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA expression, but not that of TNF\u03b1 mRNA, suggesting that bradykinin receptors differently regulate these cytokine expressions, and their role in the pathogenesis of CAIA is, at least in part, through the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6.",

            "text": "Clinical and experimental observations have suggested that synovial neovascularization is a critical component of disease progression in RA [54, 55] . There is a growing body of evidence indicating that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) participate in synovial neovascularization in arthritis [56, 57] . Thus, how EPCs are recruited to the inflamed synovium and participates in synovial neovascularization becomes an important issue. Recently, we have demonstrated that HKa regulates EPC functions in vitro [58, 59] , revealing the connection between the KKS activation and EPC biology. In rodent model of arthritis, we found another role of the KKS in the homing function of EPCs in arthritis [51] . In Lewis rat model of arthritis, EPCs are recruited to inflamed synovium and form new vessels, which was blocked by specific plasma kallikrein inhibitor; Bradykinin stimulates transendothelial migration of EPCs by selectively upregulating expression of homing receptor C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) [51] . Our study provides novel evidence that activation of the KKS is associated with synovial recruitment of EPCs at acute phase of arthritis, EPCs are likely a new target for bradykinin in the setting of acute arthritis. The multiple function of contact system in arthritis demonstrates that therapeutic approaches targeting the KKS activation have considerable potential in arthritis.",

            "text": "IBD is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, its principal types include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Plasma KKS activation has been observed in patients with IBD [60] . In active ulcerative colitis patients, a significant decrease of plasma prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, and C1 inhibitor levels was observed as compared with controls. The decreases in KKS components results from the consumption by activation. Activation of the KKS may mediate inflammation in the active phase of ulcerative colitis. In Crohn's disease patients, plasma levels of prekallikrein, factor XI, HK and its cleaved form were normal. However, they had significantly higher levels of antigen and functional Cl-inhibitor. The undetectable contact system activation in peripheral blood might be related to the high plasma levels of Cl-inhibitor, an important inhibitor of the contact system in the circulation [61] . Both B2R and B1R proteins are expressed in the epithelial cells of normal intestines and those from patients with UC and CD. B1R protein is localized in macrophages at the center of granulomas in CD. B2R protein expression in the apexes of enterocytes in the basal area and intracellularly in inflammatory tissue is similar with normal tissue. In contrast, B1R protein is localized in the basal area of enterocytes in normal intestine but in the apical portion of enterocytes in inflamed tissue. Compared with normal controls, B1R protein is significantly increased in both active UC and CD intestines [61] . In patients with active UC, B1R mRNA is significantly higher than B2R mRNA. However, in inactive UC patients, the B1R and B2R mRNA are comparably expressed. Thus, increased B1R gene and protein expression in active IBD provides a structural basis of the important role of bradykinin in chronic inflammation, and may reflect intestinal inflammation.",

Kinetics of inflammation in inbred Lewis rats injected with PG-PS is correlated with activation of the contact system. Lewis rats had a biphasic course of enterocolitis. Consumption of the precursor proteins PK and HK in Lewis rats indicates activation of the plasma contact system and closely correlated with chronic intestinal inflammation. In another indomethacin induced enterocolitis model, rat displayed KKS activation manifested by a significant decrease in plasma prekallikrein and HK functional levels, and by HK cleavage [62] . Since KKS activation occurs in association with intestinal injury, regardless of the triggering agent, suggesting that activation of this system is integrally involved in intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible hosts. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein significantly decreased acute intestinal inflammation and more dramatically reduced the tissue granulocyte recruitment. Moreover, in PG-PS model of IBD, HK deficiency modulates chronic intestinal inflammation [63] . These results indicate the importance of the contact system in chronic enterocolitis and systemic inflammation.",

            "text": "Recent studies using mouse model of IBD have shed light onto the mechanism underlying the role of contact system in the IBD pathogenesis. Colitis induced by 2,4,6trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) is associated with tissue damage, neutrophil infiltration, which can be reduced by the selective B1R antagonist SSR240612 and B1R deficiency [64] . Although these results suggest the role of B1R in the pathogenesis of IBD, this effect seems model-specific. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, colitis was significantly exacerbated in B1R \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment with a selective B1R antagonist, DALBK or SSR240612, had no effect on DSS-induced colitis [64] . In contrast, a selective B2R antagonist prevented the exacerbation of colitis in B1R \u2212/\u2212 mice. B2R mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in colonic tissue from the B1R \u2212/\u2212 mice after DSS administration. Thus, exacerbation of DSS-induced colitis in mice lacking B1R is through compensatory up-regulation of B2R. Although this study suggests that B2R is a major receptor mediating the role of bradykinin in IBD, B2R \u2212/\u2212 mice is not protected from the disease in the same DSS model [65] . Thus, the role of bradykinin and specific involvement of its two receptors in the pathogenesis of IBD is very complex, more work is warranted to evaluate their dynamic cooperation and distinct involvement in the development and progression of the diseases.",
