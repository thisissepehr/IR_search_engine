Table 3 illustrates the distribution of P.palmeni and P.phlebophyllae eggs on the various willows at all sample sites. These data demonstrate that psyllid eggs are highly aggregated on male and female catkins and that very few are laid on the rest of the plant. This is not surprising on willows in which the catkin appears before the leaves and in which initially only the catkin is available to the gravid female for oviposition, but it also applies to those willows whose catkins appear after the leaves. Female psyllids must therefore actively seek catkins for oviposition. However, eggs were laid abundantly on both male and female catkins even though the former withered and dropped from the plant before the eggs hatched. This represents a major source of mortality in the populations of both P.palmeni and P.phlebophyllae. It was only on the female catkins that the psyllids were able to continue their development. Except for the odd end of the season sample, when numbers were small, the densities remained consistently very much greater on catkins than on the rest of the plant (see Table 4 ). Moreover, most of the nymphs found on the catkin shoot were associated with leaf axils right at the base of the catkin stalk.

This strongly suggests that P.palmeni is prevented from breeding on the Ice Scrape. This may be because Psylla palmeni overwinters as an adult and becomes active in spring as snow melt occurs. Overwintering adults will require protected hibernation sites in the ground vegetationllitter layer and these sites are absent from the Ice Scrape. Furthermore, ice movement over the host plant and surface flooding, at a time when adults are becoming active, will further minimize their chances of survival.

In general growth and reproduction can only occur while the host plant itself is growing, although there is some evidence for aphids that feeding on plants can occur prior to bud burst (Hill, 1962) . Thus if the plant is growing for only a short period, a high degree of phenological synchrony between insect and host plant is essential if the resource is to be fully exploited. The life cycles of both P.palrneni and P.phlebophyllae a t Meade River show a high degree of synchrony with host plant phenology and this, coupled with a rapid development rate, enables them t o complete a generation within the summer season. Such a life history is essentially the same as in the equivalent temperate univoltine Salixfeeding species Psylla rnoscovita and Pmliceti Forster where growth and reproduction occurs during the short period of the year when conditions are favourable (Hodkinson & White, 1979) . This shows a marked contrast with the heather psyllid Strophingia ericae (Curtis), in which the evergreen host plant is 'available' throughout the year, and which has adapted t o more rigorous climatic regimes by extending its life cycle from I t o 2 years (Hodkinson, 1973a, b; Parkinson & Whittaker, 1975) . Several adaptational features permit such a rapid life cycle. Firstly, both P.palrneni and P.phlrbophyllae lie t o the left of the r-k selection spectrum as defined by Southwood (1977) and possess attributes, such as high reproductive/mortality rates, necessary for the rapid exploitation of a temporary resource, albeit a somewhat restricted food resource. Secondly, the psyllids select a highly favourable microenvironment on the plant, namely the female catkin. Johnson (pers. comm.) showed that levels of soluble nitrogen, the food source of psyllids, are greater in female catkins than in any other plant component growing on the Alaskan tundra.

This can be achieved by the sexually mature females being present on the plant at time of catkin burst and seeking out catkins for oviposition. Ovary maturation in female psyllids prior to the Salix flushing suggests that they are able to obtain some nutrition from stems.
