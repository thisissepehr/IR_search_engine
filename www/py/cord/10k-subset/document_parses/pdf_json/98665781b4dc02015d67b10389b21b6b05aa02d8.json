The study describes the epidemiological and virological features of the outbreak and discusses the origin of the infection. Methods: Poultry exposure and timelines of key events for each patient were collected. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted. Results: Five patients were reported in the outbreak. An epidemiological investigation showed that all patients had been exposed at live poultry markets. The A(H7N9) isolates from these patients had low pathogenicity in avian species. Both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences indicated that the source of infection was from Guangxi Province, which lies 100 km to the east of Wenshan City. Conclusions: In the study, a sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9 was documented in urban area of Wenshan City. Chickens were an important carrier in the H7N9 virus spreading from Guangxi to Wenshan.

The influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity divergence and sequence comparison of the two viral surface glycoproteins, HA and NA. Currently, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been identified [3, 4] . According to epidemiological features, influenza in humans can be described as seasonal, pandemic or human-avian influenza. At present, seasonal A influenza is caused by the viruses of subtypes A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). Influenza pandemics occur when new strain/subtype of virus emerges. Large population will be infected causing high levels of mortality. The disease produced by the avian influenza viruses (AIV) that transmitted across species to humans is called human-avian influenza. The two most important AIV causing human threats are the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes. The ongoing circulation of these viruses continues to pose a pandemic threat due to their rapid geographical expansion and genetic diversity, and may eventually the adaptation to humans which may result in human-to-human transmission [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 165, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 166, "end": 168, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 405, "end": 407, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1212, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Since March 2013, novel strains of H7N9 AIV have emerged and spread rapidly across mainland China.

The H7N9 outbreak in Wenshan occurred in June. Similar to what has been observed for other provinces with newly emerged H7N9 cases (except Sichuan and Chongqing), human cases have been reported since April and mainly in May and June. Live poultry or poultry products transported from previously affected provinces caused the gradual spread of H7N9 AIV. Thus, the peak of human infections in the provinces with newly emerged cases was delayed by 4 months compared to eastern China [15] . All cases in the Wenshan H7N9 outbreak had a history of LPM exposure in urban area. This is different from the H7N9 outbreaks in neighboring Guangxi Province, where showed a higher proportion of backyard poultry exposure among human cases [16] . Therefore, the Wenshan outbreak was quickly brought under control by closure of LPM and environmental disinfection. HA genes of isolates from Wenshan mainly clustered with viruses from Guangxi provinces. However, the isolates from other newly emerged provinces clustered with different isolates from various regions of China [15] . The phenomenon reflected the H7N9 AIV was spread by multiple routes in the whole country. All the four isolates from Wenshan patients contained a single basic aa substitution (KGR\u2193G) at the cleavage site, which has been associated with low pathogenicity in avian species. A highly pathogenic H7N9 AIV variant emerged and caused 28 human infections in seven provinces (Guangdong, Taiwan, Guangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Henan) in the Wave Five [17] . However, there was no significant difference in fatality and severity in humans infected with either low or high pathogenicity H7N9 AIV [18] . Ativiral resistance-conferring R292K mutations on NA protein were detected from eastern China in the Wave Five [17, 19] . However, all of the four Wenshan isolates did not contain any of the amino acid substitutions that are known to confer reduced inhibition by the NA inhibitor class of antivirals. These results indicate that neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drugs could still be effective for the treatment. Amino acid changes D627K and D701N in PB2 have been considered to be critical adaptations and virulence factors for infecting mammals. They have much higher proportions in human-isolated H7N9 viruses than in avian-isolated forms in all five waves [20] . In the Wenshan outbreak, no isolate presented K627 and N701 mutations, which reflects a direct cross-species transmission of H7N9 AIV from chickens to humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 720, "end": 724, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 966, "end": 970, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1756, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1899, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2017, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2021, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2566, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analyses of the genetic similarity of virus strains indicated that the source of infection is from Guangxi Province.
