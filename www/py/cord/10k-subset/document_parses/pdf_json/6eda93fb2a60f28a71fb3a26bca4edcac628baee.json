In this paper the problem of allocating and scheduling limited multiple, identical or non-identical, resources employed in parallel, when there are several infected areas, is considered. A heuristic algorithm, based on Shih's (1974) and Pappis and Rachaniotis' (2010) algorithms, is proposed as the solution methodology. A numerical example implementing the proposed methodology in the context of a specific disease outbreak, namely influenza, is presented.

The key parameter for many epidemiology models is the basic reproduction number R 0 , which is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is susceptible to the disease (Hethcote 2000) . When control actions are implemented, however, not all contacts will be susceptible to infection. In this case the effective reproduction number R E is used which takes into account the time-dependent variations in the transmission potential of the agent triggering the outbreak (Nishiura & Chowell 2009 ). The objective of the control actions described above is to decrease the value of the effective reproduction number below one. Due to control actions infected individuals may not pass the infection to susceptible individuals during their infectious period and eventually the infection dies out.",

In most cases, several disease transmission modeling approaches are utilized for assessing the possible effects of control interventions. These interventions could be pharmaceutical (use of antiviral drugs or vaccines), non-pharmaceutical (closure of schools, voluntary quarantines over a wide area, social distancing and travel limitations) or any combination thereof. For modeling the progression of the disease several approaches have been presented in the literature. These approaches range from simple compartmental models based on differential equations (Alexander et Limited vaccine supplies as well as limited ancillary medical supplies are among the resources to be allocated in the case of influenza outbreak control. As vaccination remains in the forefront of any influenza control strategy, the usage of limited vaccine stockpiles and their optimal allocation among sub-populations play a crucial role (particularly vaccination of at-risk individuals). Several studies consider aspects of prioritization by using age-targeted allocation strategies , Lee et al. 2010) . A more specific problem of this category is the allocation of limited vaccine supplies targeting both at-risk groups and age-dependent groups of susceptible individuals ( The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The statement of the problem is presented in section 2. In section 3 the modelling approach is provided. A heuristic algorithm for solving the problem is proposed in section 4. A numerical example implementing the proposed methodology in the context of a specific disease outbreak (influenza) is presented in section 5, where a detailed epidemic transmission model capturing realistic disease patterns is coupled with the proposed modeling approach. In section 6 the main findings of the study, its limitations as well as fruitful areas for further research are discussed. The paper ends with some concluding remarks.",

The same holds for disease outbreaks attributed to natural causes. For example, during the last pandemic influenza outbreak A(H1N1)v most countries launched mass vaccination campaigns. In the case of Greece, public health authorities commissioned several mobile medical teams to vaccinate certain groups of the Greek population like house bound individuals or institutionalized ones.",

In the latter the problem of scheduling multiple resources employed as parallel identical or non-identical processors (multi-processor tasks) for wildfires' suppression was examined. A low-order polynomial time algorithm was proposed for scheduling resources according to their availability and the fires' severity. The selection of the proposed methodology can be justified by the fact that Shih's algorithm is very fast to implement and yields satisfactory solutions (Ibaraki and Katoh 1988) , whereas Pappis and Rachaniotis (2010) algorithm has an empirically proven satisfactory performance in the quite similar dynamic problem of wildfire containment.",

In the case where the vaccination starts 60 days after the beginning of the transmission it seems that the number of infections averted is very small (only 59 cases) compared to a no vaccination policy.

More precisely, the smallest sub-population has been used as the main driver for proportionally assigning vaccination units to the rest of the sub-populations ( Table 5 ). The smallest sub-population has been assigned a single vaccination unit. The total number of teams in this case is equal to 35, assuming, of course, that such a capacity will be available for controlling a massive influenza outbreak. This is the \"maximum resources\" allocation scenario. The rationale behind this comparison (third and fourth scenario) is to find a better way to allocate the same amount of resources while reducing the cumulative number of infected individuals in each district. For each possible vaccination initiation day, the solution (number of infective cases) yielded by the heuristic algorithm is compared to the baseline scenario, (no vaccination) and the maximum resources scenario (constant number of allocated mobile medical teams to each district by using population drivers as seen in Table 5 ). The numbers of infected individuals under the three scenarios are presented in Table  6 and the mobile medical teams' initial allocation to AHDs at a specific allocation day according to the heuristic algorithm implementation is depicted in Table 7 . Finally, the cumulative infected cases for the three scenarios are depicted in Figure 3 . Table 6 Number of infected persons under the baseline scenario, the maximum resources scenario and the heuristic algorithm solution Table 7 Mobile medical teams' initial allocation according to the proposed heuristic algorithm The Gantt chart in Figure 4 illustrates the number of allocated mobile medical teams that dynamically changes and the vaccination completion time for every AHD in the case of applying the heuristic algorithm when the vaccination initiates at day d=7. The entire vaccination campaign is completed in 66 days, which is an acceptable limit in order for it to be considered necessary and helpful, taking into account the already mentioned fact that the epidemic peak is around day 60. Data from Table 6 suggests that the maximum resources scenario clearly outperforms the baseline (no vaccination) scenario. The percentage difference of total infective cases ranges from 31.8% to 52.7% respectively, increasing when the vaccination campaign initiates earlier. The heuristic algorithm's solution also outperforms the maximum resources scenario where the percentage difference of total infected cases ranges from 1.1% to 2.3% respectively. Although this percentage reduction is small, in practice it could be translated into 15-20 less deaths per 1,000 infective cases averted.",

Several resource allocation scenarios have been simulated. In particular, a passive (do nothing) 'baseline' and three active responses have been considered.

The results are very sensitive to the assumptions regarding the initiation day of the immunization campaign, i.e. the longer the delay for initiating the vaccination campaign, the worst the performance of all the resource allocation scenarios. This is largely attributable to the fact that the effects of a delayed immunization campaign do not proceed at the pace of the epidemic and, thus, more people become eventually infected. Although a resource allocation policy where resources are distributed according to population criteria is presumably the fairest strategy, our results have proven that this does not yield the optimal resources utilization. In fact, the modeling approach presented gives preference to the more populated health districts.

Most of them are closely related to the inherent uncertainties surrounding any infectious disease outbreak and especially the dynamics of disease transmission. The SVEIR model used in this study and its deterministic nature comes with several simplifying assumptions, especially the ones related to disease's transmission rates and vaccine's immunogenicity thresholds. For instance, social networks and contact processes that dictate disease transmission patterns or age-specific differences in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of influenza have not been considered. The usage of an individual-based model would have yielded more accurate results as it would have captured more realistic disease patterns and contact structures among all individuals in the sub-populations. It is worth noting, however, that the inclusion of a large degree of detail and heterogeneity in any epidemiological model comes at a computational cost. Compartmental models are more computationally tractable and allow extensive sensitivity analysis (Kaplan et al. 2003 ). In addition, epidemic models based on free mixing give larger disease outbreaks and from a public health perspective developing tools for the \"worst-case\" approach might be preferable. The disease progression model used in this study is not extremely complex and it might be unsuitable for guiding the selection of control interventions. However, it has been mainly used for illustrating the applicability of the proposed modeling approach which it is believed to be broadly applicable.",

Parameters' values of the SVEIR epidemiological model have been carefully selected to reflect the particularities of the targeted population. In particular, a literature search was initially conducted for the identification of a range of plausible influenza parameter values based on data collected during the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic (Bo\u00eblle et al. 2011, Van Der Weijden et al. 2013, Wichmann et al. 2010).

In the case of pandemic influenza outbreaks, vaccines' allocation strategies among different cities or even geographical regions have also been examined (Matrajt et al. 2013, Yarmand et al. 2014). Other studies consider aspects of limited vaccine supply as well as limited vaccination administration capacities (Cruz-Aponte et al. 2011). Apart from vaccines, other resources for controlling influenza outbreaks may refer to clinics to care for those infected (Carr & Roberts 2010) or combination of allocation of antiviral drugs, vaccines and other supplies (Das et al. 2008, Koyuncu & Erol 2010, Krumkamp et al. 2011, Stein et al. 2012, Zhou & Fan 2012). In addition, allocation of scarce resources like vaccines or antiviral drugs in conjunction with non-pharmaceutical approaches have also been developed (Hansen & Day 2011, Wallinga et al. 2010, Yaesoubi & Cohen 2011). Limited financial resources for controlling influenza outbreaks have also been developed. Budget constraints may refer to limited financial resources for the procurement of vaccines and antiviral drugs, relevant capacities for their administration etc. (Mbah & Gilligan 2011, Uribe-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2011). A concise survey regarding resource allocation for epidemic control can be found in (Brandeau 2005). The uniqueness and severity of the problem necessitates the development of dynamic, real-time and effective solutions, thus making the topic very suitable for OR/MS research.",
