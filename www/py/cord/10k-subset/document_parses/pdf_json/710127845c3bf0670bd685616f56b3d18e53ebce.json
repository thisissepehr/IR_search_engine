The nephropathy subcommittee of the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC) has published the following validation criteria for rodent models of DN based on the clinical and pathological features of human DN: (1) >50 % decrease in renal function, (2) >10-fold increase in albuminuria, and (3) pathological features including advanced mesangial matrix expansion (\u00b1nodules), thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, arteriolar hyalinosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis [17] .

Nevertheless, kidney Ang II concentration and AT1R expression were decreased in both groups. The recent development of ACE2-Ang (1-7)-mas concept has provided new insights into the effects of Ang II in animal experimental models. This novel concept states that RAS has two axes: the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang (1-7)-mas axis. The former axis induces vasoconstriction, proliferation, and proinflammatory functions through Ang II, and the latter axis counteract the effects of the former axis through the major heptapeptide effector Ang (1-7) [18, 19] . ACE2 cleaves Ang II to produce abundant levels of Ang (1-7) in the proximal tubule, which produces vasodilation and antiproliferative, natriretic, and diuretic effects [20] . Despite its significant role, the exact role of ACE2 and Ang (1-7) in kidney disease is not clearly understood. It has been reported that inhibition of ACE2 function accelerates diabetic injury and human recombinant ACE2 reduces the progression [21, 22] . Moreover, Ang (1-7) attenuates the progression of diabetic nephropathy in animal models [23, 24] . Our study showed a downregulation of ACE2-Ang (1-7)-mas axis in diabetic rats, and the beneficial effects of ATRQ\u03b2-001 vaccine and olmesartan treatment may partly due to the upregulation of this axis. Although the exact mechanism of how these two axes counteract with each other remains unknown, we can conclude that the vaccine regulates the two RAS axes, not only inhibiting AT1R overactivation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 706, "end": 710, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 711, "end": 714, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 885, "end": 889, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1145, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1240, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1244, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Safety considerations are paramount when developing any vaccine but are particularly important when targeting a condition for which many safe and effective alternative therapies are available.

Combined with our previous studies, vaccination-targeted AT1R showed no immune-mediated injuries [11, 12] and was also confirmed in this study. The antibody response was reversible as the possibility of halting antibody production. For ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity, there are still several controversies in terms of its onset and regulation. Nevertheless, the potential effects caused by the vaccine needed further investigation. As the target peptide of the vaccine was only eight amino acids in length, then it was smaller than the minimal size of a T cell epitope and therefore should not be able to induce a T cell response [26] . Several studies had estimated that vaccines comprising self-molecules coupled to VLPs present optical candidates capable of achieving efficacious antibody levels while fulfilling the necessary safety criteria [27, 28] . Examples like the Ang II vaccine CYT-006-AngQb, which showed effectively reduced BP without any uncontrolled immune stimulation in both animals and patients [29, 30] . Similar to the composition, the kidney damage caused by immune complexes was not detected and no visible pathological changes were observed by light microscopy and TEM in ATRQ\u03b2-001-vaccinated animals.

The half-life of the anti-ATR-001 antibody was 14.4 days [11] , longer than any other chemical drugs presently used. No obvious feedback activation of circulating or local RAS was observed. Additionally, long-term treatment of chronic diseases is costly, tedious, and at the population level rather unsuccessful. Monoclonal antibodies specific for host proteins have proven to be highly effective, and the movement from the passive administration of monoclonal antibodies to active vaccination against selfmolecular could provide affordable medicines and broader patient acceptance and compliance. The question today in many patient populations is not whether to block the RAS but rather how best to inhibit its activity. From a theoretical perspective, vaccination has much to recommend it as a strategy.
