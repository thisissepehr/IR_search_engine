Koch said: \"diseases are best controlled and understood by means of causes, in particular, by causes that are natural\u2026\". At a stroke it destroyed the very old religious view that the cause of diseases was an expression of divine displeasure as well as its therapy in terms of prayer/miracle. Simultaneously, it also overturned the Hippocratic/Galenic account in terms of \"fluid\" medicine. \"Solid\" medicine became the new paradigm in medical thinking. A new research programme came into existence, a programme which after more than a 100 years is still regarded as \"progressive\" in spite of growing numbers of serious anomalies it has produced in its wake. 2.

            "text": "Although these postulates have run into anomalies, nevertheless, they continue to be regarded as canonical, exercising a compelling hold over research in Biomedicine. 9 Postulate 1 is key to understanding the monogenic conception of disease, as it holds that every disease has a single cause and that the cause is universal and necessary. This implies a notion of cause which is monofactorial and linear. This causal paradigm was simply borrowed from other successful Newtonian sciences such as physics and chemistry. It is said to be Humean which is also presented as the Billiard-ball account. This image is apt as it brings out certain features which are pertinent to the context of Biomedicine. The infectious-agent conception of disease as earlier remarked is \"solid\" medicine; the cause can be a bacterium/virus/fungus/ poison. The cause, just like a billiard ball, is a solid object which can be seen (under specialised instruments such as the electron microscope, PET or TOM), collected and measured/quantified, or removed, and cultivated elsewhere outside the human body. Billiard balls left to themselves would not move without the introduction of an external force, that applied initially by the player via the billiard cue hitting the first billiard ball; analogously, the infectious agent is an external pathogen which invades the human body setting off a series of motions within. 10 9 Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 2005 (on the hundredth anniversary of the prize to Koch) for their discovery that Helicobacter pylori is the cause of peptic ulcer; for a critique of their work and of Koch's postulates in general, see Lee (2012, pp. 98-103 and 108-110) . 10 The latest addition to this model of solid medicine within the Billiard-ball causal framework is genetic material with the emergence of DNA genetics and molecular biology since the late 1950 s. Although not an external pathogen, the cause is, nevertheless, a piece of matter (a snippet of DNA) which could be either snipped off or inserted in order to eliminate a disease in the individual. This model neither departs from thing-ontology nor from monofactorial causation even though in reality, so far at least, it applies only in the rare cases of diseases identified as caused by single-gene defects.",

            "text": "Although RCT and EBM constitute the Gold Standards of scientificity in Biomedicine as already observed, the former is not above challenge as it relies on randomisation to eliminate bias from its experimental set-up. 11 This requires the trial to have primarily two arms, the experimental and the control. The former is given the treatment but not the latter. Should the difference in outcome between the two arms be positive (and also pass the test of being statistically significant), then this is attributed to the efficacy of the treatment. This conclusion appears to be methodologically sound only because the experimental set-up appears to conform to Mill's experimental logic, that of the method of difference. 12 RCT, relying, in the main, methodologically on the technique of randomisation amounts to presupposing the axiom which may be called the axiom of homogeneity. However, this axiom, in reality, fails to obtain except by resorting to the device of deeming participants/ patients to be homogenous, save in one respect only. As a matter of fact, patients are heterogenous, not homogenous as a group. As a result, the RCT-EBM-approved-\"efficacious\" treatment may turn out to be irrelevant to their concern. Individual patients are not artefacts which can be ordered from a factory to conform uniformly to a very specific set of common characteristics. Randomisation as the key methodological/analytical technique can undoubtedly take care of allocation bias, but not other sorts of bias, such as selection bias. RCT's inability to eliminate the latter type of bias renders its results at best statistically relevant and at worst clinically irrelevant. While hospital management in general and organisations such as NICE (in the UK) are interested in statistical relevance in respect of a drug's efficacy, the \"field\" doctor who is concerned with individual patient care is interested in clinical relevance: a drug which passes the test of statistical relevance (via RCT-EBM) may be of no help to the doctor-and-her-patient, whereas a drug which has failed to pass such a test may be of help to the individual doctor-and-her-patient (given the patient's own specificities of a medical-physical-psychological-social-moral kind known to the doctor who is in charge of her health). 13 The axiom of homogeneity suffers from severe methodological limitations. Broadbent (2017, p. 93) 14 characterises Epidemiology as follows: 11 As EBM involves a meta-analysis of RCTs, any methodological flaws which may be found in RCTs will necessarily undermine the soundness in turn of EBM. 12 See Mill (1843) ; for details of this interpretation of Mill, see Lee (2017b . 13 For detailed arguments of points raised above, see Lee (2017b) . 14 See also Bhopal (2008, p. 3) for his much shorter definition; according to Riegelman and Kirkwood (2015, p. 232) : \"Our definition of population health-the totality of all evidence-based public and private efforts to preserve and promote health and prevent disease, disability, and death. This broad twenty-first century definition requires public health agencies and professionals to collaborate with a range of government agencies and healthcare professionals and institutions\". Definitions of epidemiology vary, but include some common elements, especially the phrase \"distribution and determinants of disease.\" I define \"epidemiology\" as the study of the distribution and determinants of disease and other health states in human populations by means of group comparisons, for the purpose of improving population health. \u2026 Epidemiology is a discipline that essentially involves documenting the way health states occur in human populations, and trying to explain the documented patterns of occurrence. \u2026 Most epidemiologists, though not all, will also accept that the purpose of epidemiology is to improve population health. \u2026 the history of epidemiology definitely links it to both medicine and public health.",

Certainly, the nineteenthcentury pioneers such as John Snow (1813-1858, generally acknowledged to be the founding father of Epidemiology) 15 during the cholera epidemic in London in 1854, was keen to work out why one neighbourhood in London suffered a cholera mortality rate 14 times greater than another neighbourhood, rather than investigate why this or that particular individual died of cholera. However, one should not misunderstand this to mean that successful epidemiological research would have no impact on individual lives as it clearly can and does-for instance, once the handle of the pump in Broad Street was removed, the death rate fell dramatically. While lab researchers concentrate on identifying the infectious agent and producing an effective form of treatment against the disease-causing agent, Epidemiology concentrates on public health measures to prevent a certain disease pattern from emerging.",

Snow could only infer that there must be something unsavoury about that pump which made people fall ill upon drinking water contaminated by such a source. It was not till 1884, 30 years after Snow's pioneering work in 1854, that Koch discovered that the infectious causal agent was the vibrio cholera. 16 Time has moved on since the nineteenth century. Epidemiology, today, is said to be a young, developing science, whose \"ancestry\" is very recent indeed. Broadbent (2017, p. 93) writes: 15 In fact, a little earlier in 1847, Ignaz Semmelweiss (1818-1865) had carried out a type of investigation, methodologically similar to that of Snow. He demonstrated that puerperal fever was infectious as well as contagious and that its incidence was significantly reduced when medical staff were instructed to wash their hands, after visiting the mortuary and touching the cadavers, before tending to patients in the maternity ward. 16 The truth is more complicated. Nobody, including Koch himself, knew that the discovery had already been made in 1854 by an Italian scientist called Filippo Pacini (1812-1883). Pacino died poor and obscure. In 1965, 82 years after his death, the international committee on nomenclature adopted Vibrio cholera Pacini 1854 as the correct name of the cholera-causing organism. See UCLA (2017). Epidemiology did not emerge as a distinct field until the latter part of the twentieth century, and indeed teaching approaches and career paths are still not finalized.

For instance, O'Connor and McDermott (1997) distinguish a system from a heap: the former is a series of inter-connected parts which function as a Whole; when parts are removed or added to, it changes; its behaviour depends on its overall structure (the arrangements of its component parts). The latter is a mere collection of its parts; its parts function independently of one another; hence the arrangement of its components as well as overall structure is irrelevant, as its behaviour depends merely on its size. The notion of system can be used to describe complex biological relationships (such as in ecology/study of ecosystems). It may be used to characterise relationships/processes found in an organisation. It may also be used in understanding illnesses, their diagnosis and treatments as found in CCM (see section to follow on the subject). 21 Ecosystem Thinking/Systems Thinking is keen to point out that the relationship between events/processes involves complicated systemic linkages, drawing out clearly such a methodological implication of Wholism. One can re-cast the enhanced Triangle of Causation in terms of nesting ecosystems: the Host (the person) as Ecosystem 1, the Agent (the chemicals in tobacco smoke which are carcinogenic to the Host) as Ecosystem 2, the Environment as Ecosystem 3. Indeed, 1, 2 and 3 may be said to form another more-encompassing ecosystem, namely, Ecosystem 4. See Fig. 2 below.",

These features lead to the emergence of patterns at various scales. (Diez Roux 2011) Such an approach involves identifying and studying the presence of important causal loops in the system. In many types of population health problems feedback mechanisms are found between behavioural and environmental features as well as between health and social circumstances.

In a system, when changes in a factor/variable provide feedback into the process, generating feedback loops which may produce positive or negative impacts. Suppose high taxes on cigarettes would reduce the number of smokers. The next step to pursue is to see if higher taxation would lead to changes over time in social attitudes to smoking which may then make it possible to increase enforcement of public On the other hand, raising cigarette taxes would mean the treasury has less money to render smoking cessation programs accessible to help individuals to quit the habit.

An ecological community may be defined (albeit simplistically) in terms of a group of actually or potentially interacting species of organisms living in the same place-one well known type of possible interaction is of course the prey-predator relationship, another is mutualism. A population in ecological literature refers to a group of individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area-for instance, the Arctic supports a population of polar bears. Ecology concentrates on population rather than on the individual organism in a population; one reason amongst others is that scientists/society have neither the economic nor technological resources to study individual organisms, even very large ones, like large mammals such as polar bears. Furthermore, their primary focus is on characteristics of population: distribution (the area in which the population exists); abundance or size of the population; its rates of growth, birth and death; spacing and dispersion, emigration and immigration (as animals are mobile, seeds of plants can spread via wind, water, mobile animals), predator-prey relationship; disease which can affect population growth either directly by killing off the young before they can even reach reproductive age or by affecting the reproductively mature animal through undermining their health and, thereby, their reproductive performance. 23 Ecology studies ecosystems.

Some can be very big, such as Antarctica or the Arctic, others infinitesimally small in comparison, such as a handful of soil. 2. Any ecosystem, such as that of Yellowstone Park or the Gobi Desert, occupies a certain portion of time and space which has a historical dimension both in terms of time and space. For instance, neither Yellowstone nor the Gobi had existed from time immemorial, nor historically would the space they each commanded be necessarily identical to that they each now respectively occupy. It is sometimes possible, though not frequently, to ascertain the precise beginning of an ecosystem, such as the sudden throwing up of a small island in the middle of an ocean as a result of an undersea volcanic eruption. 3. An ecosystem evolves, changing all the time-at time t 1 , a particular item predominates, at time t 2 , that item may have retreated somewhat, its predominant position taken over by another item. For instance, in a shoreline ecosystem at t 1 , large cliffs stand out, but at t 2 , some of the cliffs might have collapsed into the sea below, generating a new landscape with changes for the ecosystem involved, even to the extent of perhaps creating two related but different ecosystems. 4.

In other words, this Whole has properties which are over and above, not simply the sum of the properties of all the constituent parts. Let us briefly look at this implication of Ecosystem Wholism by considering a handful of soil. The soil consists of both biotic (usually micro-organisms but also macro-organisms such as worms which are visible to the naked eye) as well as abiotic elements, such as water, air, chemicals (PH content, etc.). The character of the soil (such as its texture) cannot be accounted for solely in terms of the properties of each of its constituent components-it may be said, therefore, to be an emergent property of the Whole system, born of the complex interplay between all the variables involved in that handful of soil and the micro-climate of which it is a part.",

Foxes prey on rabbits. Increase of foxes would mean decrease of rabbits, but as rabbits are eaten up by foxes, the predator would suffer from a shortage of prey. As a result, the fox population would decline; the rabbit population would instead increase. As a result, equilibrium is restored between predator and prey, equivalent to a negative feedback loop. It is seen to be at work in regulating populations in ecology. An ecosystem would be de-stabilised if its populations (whether between animals and animals, plants and animals, plants and plants) exceed its carrying capacity. 10. An ecosystem also exhibits positive feedback loops which are responsible for the sudden appearance of rapid changes. Positive feedback involves a circular set of effects which are self-reinforcing. For instance, an ecosystem primarily of grasses with few shrubs may be stable for five to ten or more years. Yet such an ecosystem may change over time and the change would occur within a relatively short period of time. Shrubs which started off by being few and far between amongst the grasses, take a much longer time than grasses to establish themselves in the ecosystem, as their roots go deeper and initially competed unfavourably for rain water with grasses, whose roots are in the topsoil. Hence the ecosystem remains basically a grass ecosystem. However, over time, the shrubs, having established themselves, albeit slowly, would begin to grow taller, overshadowing the grass. Then seemingly suddenly, the grasses would be at a disadvantage in the competition for sunlight, fade and not flourish as well as they have done in the past. The grass ecosystem would have then turned itself into a shrub ecosystem. As established shrubs are more successful in capturing the available water and sunlight than the grasses, these will decrease dramatically. Positive feedback loops act as forces of change and are a source of instability.",

Lee ( , 2018 demonstrate that ancient Chinese philosophy, as found in Daojia philosophy (whose foundational texts include the Laozi, the Zhuangzi and the Huainanzi, just to mention three) rests on process-ontology, based on Qi as the fundamental ontological category (operating under two modes, Qi-in-concentrating mode as thing and Qi-in-dissipating mode as process/processes with the latter being primus inter pares in respect of the former 25 ). Such a philosophy endorses or implicitly uses for its science a causal model which is multi-factorial, non-linear and reciprocal. CCM as a pre-eminent science whose metaphysical/methodological core can be traced back to its roots in Daojia philosophy, is clearly an instance of what this author calls Ecosystem Science/Science. As Ecosystem Science, it is Wholist in its ontology and non-Reductionist in its methodology. 26 We can present CCM's Ecosystem Thinking in terms of concentric circles as Ecosystem-nesting.",

Water stands for Winter (when yinqi is at its maximum) but as water is an indispensable requirement for Life and Life's activities, Water is said to generate Wood. Wood stands for Spring (when yinqi begins to retreat and yangqi to rise) and therefore for all Life and its activities. Wood in turn is said to engender Fire (as it is obvious that to start a fire one would need a fuel such as wood, and Fire stands for Summer when yangqi is at its maximum). In turn Fire engenders Earth; Earth permits organisms to thrive but when these die, they decay and are returned to Earth itself, or when wood burns, all that is left is its ashes which become soil). Earth stands for a period when yinqi and yangqi are in equilibrium. Earth engenders Metal (in the sense that Earth harbours both the biotic and the abiotic, including metals in its bowels). Metal stands for Autumn (when yangqi begins its retreat as yinqi rises, and as the ancient Chinese noticed that when the Moon was full, the tide was high, and they were particularly impressed by the high tide at the time of the full moon during the eighth lunar month of their calendar, which marks the beginning of Autumn).

The ancient Chinese clearly knew that vegetation was vital to prevent soil erosion and soil loss, especially during heavy rains when exposed soil with no vegetal cover could be washed away; by growing trees on such surfaces, soil erosion would be prevented. So in this sense, they postulated that Wood constrains Earth. Heavy rains could cause floods; to prevent flooding, one could use earth to build dykes and dams-in this sense, the ancient Chinese postulated that Earth constrains Water. To prevent a fire from spreading, one would need water to damp down the fire-in this sense, it could be said that Water constrains Fire. To make implements such as an axe, a sword, one would need fire to melt the metal before one could cast or mould it-in this sense, the ancient Chinese held that Fire constrains Metal. An axe (made from metal) would be useful in chopping down trees which in turn would provide wood to fuel fires-in this sense, the ancient Chinese postulated that Metal constrains Wood.",

A normal relationship means that in Winter, yinqi is at its maximum and yangqi is at its minimum, and that in Summer, the reverse relationship obtains. However, illness occurs when the relationship is not normal for the time of year in the individual person as ascertained by feeling the mai (normally translated as pulse but which this author thinks should be resisted). But in this context, let us understand Wuxing not so much in CCM but in general in the context of applying it to explain ecological phenomena. Abnormal relationships between yangqi and yinqi are mediated by two sub-concepts called Deficiency (buzu) and Excess (taiguo). We see these concepts at work clearly in the Mutually Constraining as well as the Mutually Engendering modes. Look at Fig. 4 again and, in particular, at Fire constraining Metal. When Fire is in excess, this means that Metal would be over-constrained by Fire; such over-constraining would provoke Metal to \"fight back\" not, however, directly against Fire, but against Water instead, as Metal engenders Water. One could then say that Fire has, ultimately, \"met its own come-uppance\" or achieved an \"own goal\", as Water constrains Fire. Let us call this Example A.",

Spelt out a bit more fully, it runs as follows: Water constrains Fire or Fire is constrained by Water. When Fire qi is deficient, Fire would be unduly constrained by Water and thus, Water would undermine/damage Fire. Fire constrains Metal or Metal is being constrained by Fire. However, as Fire itself is undermined and weakened by Water, Metal, in reaction, would take advantage of Fire's weakness and turn round to undermine Fire. In the Engendering cycle, we know that Fire engenders Earth; but here Fire itself has been weakened and its weakened state would in turn impact upon its process of engendering Earth.

When excessive tree cutting occurs, Wood would be adversely affected (with fewer trees left standing). Wood constrains Earth; with fewer trees around, Wood's ability to constrain Earth would result in Deficiency (in other words, soil loss/erosion would increase). Earth constrains Water, but with soil loss/erosion, Earth can no longer perform adequately the role of holding back water, owing to its qi Deficiency. Water engenders Wood; but when Earth can no longer constrain Water, Water in turn, in this context, would result in Deficiency, and Water would be unable to engender Wood.

It also coincided with a long period of unrest, with continuous wars, including those before the Three Kingdoms period (220-265 CE) as well as those occurring during it. This meant that the economy suffered, production went down. The conjuncture of natural disasters, economic chaos and war would inevitably lead to all sorts of unimaginable social ills. People were driven from the land, and therefore, into poverty, hunger, illnesses, and even cannibalism, with death and corpses everywhere throughout China's heartland. Under such circumstances, epidemics naturally flourished. Zhang Zhongjing wrote, in the Preface to his book, that of his own extended family/clan which included more than 200 people, two-thirds had died; 70% of those, who perished, had died from the epidemic raging then from 196 CE. Historians have calculated that roughly half of the Chinese population could have perished in total. As a result, Zhang Zhongjing was not only determined to help relieve suffering but also seize the opportunity to study the epidemic, to collect as much information as he could, including the prescriptions which were used by physicians at large to handle effectively some of the cases involved. 36 No suspicion, naturally, would be cast on the appearance of epidemics in Chinese history; but the sceptical may immediately doubt that the ancient Chinese might have the concept of epidemiology at all, even if the ancient concept would not be as sophisticated as the one which Broadbent (cited earlier) has written about. The quick way to quell this doubt has already been just given, namely, that as CCM suffered/suffers no rupture of any kind, it follows that it embodied/embodies Ecosystem Thinking and such Ecosystem Thinking would cover all domains of its theory and practice. In other words, this means that in treating the phenomenon called epidemics, CCM would have used that very framework which Epidemiology today (this paper argues) deploys. This, in turn, would mean that CCM would have grasped the concept of epidemiology whether one deigns to use the term \"epidemiology\" or not; but as is the wont of this author, the term would be used but italicised, namely, it would appear as Epidemiology to mark both the similarities as well as the differences between them. What is further needed to add force to this general argument is to talk briefly about how the ancient Chinese physicians had recognised features which were/are distinctive of epidemics in order to cope adequately with the phenomenon of epidemics itself.",

They implied/imply that the physicians understood that illness in an epidemic could be a contagious matter, that is to say, 35 For a detailed account of the vagaries of his life and his work and an appreciation of his contribution to the development of CCM, see Lee (2018) , \"Appendix 2\". 36 See *Hao (2011), Lecture One. that such an illness would spread to more and more people via direct contact with those already afflicted. The preparation for the burial of those who had died from it and the presence of corpses which no one in the larger family or even clan could bury as families and clans themselves were dead or dying, was a task left to the state. The first record of such intervention occurred during the pre Qin-Han period-in the Zhouli/\u300a\u5468\u793c\u300b, 37 the abandoned dead were interred by state authorities. After this, the strategy became standard procedure during epidemics, with the state buying the coffins and carrying out the whole process of preparing the body for internment. By Song times, the state had resorted to getting Buddhist monks to carry out this task, and rewarded those who performed it with a special licence to preach their religion. In 1208 CE, the Song state instituted another policy: to encourage volunteers to bury the dead; anyone who buried two hundred abandoned bodies (who were mainly amongst the poor in society) would be given a reward (presumably financial). Furthermore, from the Northern Song onwards, the government also set up designated public sites where the poor could bury their dead and abandoned bodies could be interred. This policy greatly curtailed the spread of an epidemic.",

While the ancient Chinese physicians did not abandon, as we have seen above, the use of medicinals to help individual victims, nevertheless, they realised that the best strategy was isolation, hence quarantine. 4. Contagious illnesses necessarily involved/involve a community, a population. In other words, the best strategy, namely 3 above really implied/implies that CCM had an implicit grasp of the concept of epidemiology as their strategies appear to be concerned with \"the distribution and determinants of disease\". 5.

All these variables acting together (between a and b) could bring about an epidemic, as their mode of thinking, this paper has argued, was/is Ecosystem Thinking. 6. As CCM is Ecosystem Science, it was/is well aware that any human population must live within bigger ecosystems which include the greater natural environment, that is, Ecosystems 6, 7, 9 and 10 set out in Fig. 3 are all involved. 7. For the reasons set out briefly above, it may be appropriate to say that CCM had/ has some grasp of the concept of epidemiology, even though its version might not be identical with modern Epidemiology. Hence it might be appropriate to refer to it as Chinese Epidemiology. 8. Apart from the two looked at above, a third relevant strategy needs some brief consideration. This pertains to that of containing the devastating effects of smallpox/tianhua/\u5929\u82b1, which had evolved and developed from the long-held CCM idea of using toxin to fight toxin. Its first successful use was recorded in 1653. This may be cited as evidence for Epidemiological thinking in CCM. The strategy consists of infecting persons with a mild form of smallpox which would not kill them but instead render them immune to the illness in all its normal ferocities. CCM talked about cultivating different types of attenuated smallpox (such as shuimiao/\u6c34\u82d7, hanmaio/\u65f1\u82d7) for the purpose. Following news of success, the Japanese and the Russians introduced the strategy into their countries. The Turks also came to know about the new treatment of inoculation/variolation as Lady Mary Montague, wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Court in Istanbul learnt about it and in 1717, she successfully used it on her own children.",

However, later trials showed that one in eight of the treated died of the very disease they were being protected against; this still, however, compared favourably with the going rate of about 30 percent of the disease's untreated victims. This paved the way for Jenner (1749-1823)'s vaccination technique. The point here is not to trace the historic link between the Chinese and the Western attempts at immunology, but simply to say that the former's attempt implied/implies a grasp on the part of CCM physicians that a contagious illness such as smallpox could in principle be contained. 40 Vaccination today is a recognised tool in Epidemiology.",

However, Epidemiology today is much less concerned with contagious disease-entities, at least in First World economies (since the introduction of antibiotics at the end of the WWII) than with diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure, heart problems, etc. The \"distribution and determinants\" of such diseases are, on the whole, said by Epidemiology to be caused by inappropriate/unhealthy diets/lifestyle, and that the way forward must be to wean people away from such unwholesome to more wholesome ways of living. Did the ancient Chinese physicians have a grasp of such issues? The short answer is yes, via their general concept of Preventive Medicine which encompasses the more specific concepts of yangsheng/\u517b\u751f or yangshen/\u517b\u8eaband of shiyang/\u98df\u517b.

The dominant conception of disease in Biomedicine even today is the monogenic conception implying its hallowed paradigm of scientificity in terms of the twin Gold Standards of RCT and EBM. Although Biomedicine has an impressive list of achievements to its name, and remains a still progressive research programme, nevertheless, it has run into anomalies. Furthermore, it is a case of doing science within the Newtonian framework of thing-ontology and whose model of causality is Humean, monofactorial and linear (the Billiard-ball model). 2. In contrast, Epidemiology is perceived to lack the \"kudos\" of the monogenic conception, as it departs from the paradigm of scientificity of its senior partner. For instance, RCT is irrelevant to its methodology. It focuses on disease population patterns rather than on disease-bearing individuals who succumb to diseases. It rests on process-ontology (events/processes); the enhanced/sophisticated versions of its causal model are multi-factorial, non-linear (with feedback loops), reciprocal and synergistic. Instead of relying on drugs or surgery as treatment, Epidemiology relies on public health measures such as ensuring water and air sanitation, discouraging certain lifestyle habits (such as smoking or consuming too much sugar). 3. Ecology is Ecosystem Science/Thinking and is a variant of Systems Theory/ Thinking whose philosophical framework Epidemiology Thinking appears to share both in terms of ontology and the model of causality which its Wholist ori-entation implies. Ecology, too, studies populations rather than individual organisms. They may all be regarded as post-or non-Newtonian sciences. 4. Although all three (Systems Thinking, Ecology and Epidemiology) are pioneering non-Newtonian sciences (beginning in the twentieth century), in the long dur\u00e9e of human civilisation, their philosophical presuppositions when made explicit can be said to have a history of at least two and a half thousand years. This is for two reasons: (a) CCM is an instantiation of ancient Chinese Science and it has an uninterrupted history of at least two and a half thousand years; (b) CCM, too, rests on process-ontology, and instantiates a causal model which is multi-factorial, non-linear and reciprocal. At all levels of theory-and-practice, of organisation and analysis, it is Wholist in orientation and is fiercely non-Reductionist in its methodology.",

In Chinese culture everything is comprehended within the conceptual frame of Yin and Yang that is a holistic system. Yin and Yang are counterparts for negative and positive or female and male. Yin and yang are co-dependent. Within such a system, the notion of absolute independence makes no sense. A human relationship is also a state of interdependence; both extreme dependence and independence are seen as dysfunctional. Yin and yang also complete each other; neither is fully realized without the other. For humans, full individuality is realized in the context of the other. And when yin and yang are combined together, we get the Tao, a synergistic emergence and co-creation; something new emerges that transcends the parts.",

It might not be out of place to remind readers yet again of such differences which undoubtedly exist, although not emphasised here; to mark them, terms such as \"Wholism/Wholist\", \"Science\", \"Medicine\", \"Epidemiology\" and \"philosophy\" are italicised when used in the Chinese context. 5. Based on the above comments and arguments, this contribution feels justified to come to its main conclusion that Epidemiology (today) could be considered as Ecosystem Science/Ecosystem Thinking, and hence, of Systems Theory/Systems Thinking. 6. Furthermore, based on the historical evidence found in Chinese history in general and CCM canonical texts in particular, one may plausibly conclude that CCM down the ages had/have an understanding of epidemics and a grasp of some of the key concepts of epidemiology. However, similarities apart, there are obvious differences between the ancient Chinese understanding, on the one hand and modern understanding on the other.
