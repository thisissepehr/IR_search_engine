One purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability of the infectious clone for its manipulation and subsequent use. Use of the infectious clone also allows us to begin with a single DNA sequence, providing a well-defined starting point for studying PRRSV evolution.

Analysis of the in vitro transcribed RNA showed that Nsp2, ORF3, and ORF6 all had low levels of genetic variation even though it was prepared directly from a single bacterial colony plasmid preparation. Increased passage number generally correlated with a decrease in the percentage of the master sequence. This does not appear to be due to the emergence of more fit viral sequences because the master sequence remains the same and new quasispecies appear and disappear with passage. There were no cases of a variant present in passage 1 also being present in passage 3 of the same well, although the variants appeared at such low levels that they may not be detected with our sample size. It is also unlikely that these changes are a result of error due to the experimental methodology. Minimal error was introduced through the process of PCR, cloning and sequencing as evidenced by the fact that there were no nucleotide changes in ORF6 of the plasmid DNA in 6525 nucleotides of sequence examined. Additionally, analysis of the in vitro RNA ORF6 region found only 1 nucleotide change in 6525 nucleotides. difficult, if not impossible, to create point mutations without accumulating other changes in the genome, especially if multiple in vitro passages are required to obtain sufficient viral titers. This will be especially critical when the mutations made are detrimental to the fitness of the virus.
