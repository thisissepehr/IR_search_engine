Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child-years. The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child-years at the age of 15 years. Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella-zoster, Mycopkzsma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses. In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of \"others,\" whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycopkzsma pneumoniae, as well as varicella-zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one-half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one-fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4to 9-year age group. The difference in etiology betvc-een males and females was significant ( p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycopkzsmapneumoniae were more common in girls. The overall male-to-female ratio was 1.4: 1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero-and respiratory viruses. In the whole series, some accumulation appeared in February and March. Less than one-half of this number appeared in July and August.",

In M. pneumonzue-associated CNS infections, however, we cannot be sure of the most effective therapy. VZV causes a severe disease in children younger than 1 year old f131; our series included only one such patient, and the child made a good recovery. HSV-associated encephalitis, fortunately, is relatively rare in childhood except in infants younger than 1 year old, and the drug of choice is currently acycloguanosine 114, 151. Besides HSV, enteroviruses play a major role in this age group. For these viruses, no specific therapy is available as yet. Diagnosis is important, however, because enteroviruses are common in young infants [20, 213 . These diseases may be caused by viruses and so, basically, be encephalitides. The number of unknown causes in the winter months suggests failure to identify respiratory viruses and adenovirus, and in autumn, underdiagnosis of enteroviruses. Despite this, our series reached one of the highest levels in microbiological identification. We admit that the association is not always firm 122) and is sometimes coincidental rather than causative, but in CNS diseases, direct evidence for causality is difficult to obtam. We need a keener interest in childhood acute encephalopathies, in general. By knowing the age, sex, and season, we may anticipate the exact diagnosis and confirm it by rapid methods. Presently, we have antigen tests for respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, RSV, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3), adenoviruses, and herpes viruses (HSV, VZV, and CMV) as well as for ~171.

Meyer and colleagues 141 obtained similar results, however, few authors report on this aspect of encephalitides, presumably because of small series. Compared with the previous Finnish reports on mainly adult patients, the present series showed a greater heterogeneity of etiologies [6, 7). We had no patient with arbovirus encephalitis although we screened for arboviruses until the early 1980s, whereas at the Ma170 Clinic these patients formed the majority l181. Thus, the incidence of encephalitis needs both regional and periodic evaluation. The proportion of unknown etiologies in different series varies from 27 to 74%, and vigorous efforts are always needed to determine the causative or associated microbe 19, 143. In young children, encephalitis often escapes clinical, let alone etiological, diagnosis, which is often only established at autopsy [lo]. Additionally, we have seen many patients with convulsions of unknown origin [19f as well as ill-defined encephalopa-",
