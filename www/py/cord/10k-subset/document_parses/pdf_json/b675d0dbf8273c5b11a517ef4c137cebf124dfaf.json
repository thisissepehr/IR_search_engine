Viral factors can be important in determining disease severity [19] . Unlike other types of avian influenza virus affecting human beings, infection with the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus in humans did not cause an increase in poultry deaths. Therefore, the key concerns about the current outbreak of influenza A (H7N9) virus are how the virus crosses the species barrier. The sequence analysis of H7N9 for several patients by our previous study and Gao's group reported that the Q226L mutation in HA and the lack of a glycosylation site (cleavage site) were more likely to change the avian origin receptor to an alpha 2,6 human-like receptor and might decrease the ability of the virus to be transmitted by air [1, 6] . The Q226L mutation in HA was also detected in all 63 specimens from 26 patients in our study. The lack of a cleavage site in HA was also found in the H7N9 virus in all specimens. The 100% emergence frequency of Q226L and cleavage site in HA in our current study indicated that the emergence of those viral variants was not a chance happening under certain circumstances. The absence of the multibasic amino acid motif of the HA cleavage site which is a key virulence marker in birds, endows the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and H7N7 viruses with multiorgan tropism [19] , but whether it is a virulence marker in people needs to be further confirmed [6] . The substitution of Q591K, E627K, or D701N of PB2 is associated with mammalian adaptation and efficient replication and transmission and is found in all H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 influenza viruses that infect humans [13, 20, 21] . Mutations in E627K or D701N were also identified in cases of infection in the Shanghai, Anhui, and Zhejiang H7N9 isolates [1, 6] . We found that the mutation of Q591K was also present in the H7N9 virus. In addition, the simultaneous emergence of E627K and D701N identified in our study rarely occurred. The characteristics of the adaptation and efficient replication ability of this virus may enhance H7N9 influenza viruses, contributing to the prolonged duration of viral shedding and severe disease in almost all patients. The S31N mutation in the M2 gene was also noted in all of the patients enrolled, indicating that neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir have been the main drugs used for antiviral treatment of patients infected with H7N9. We also detected seven patients harboring the neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant associating R292K mutation. The emergence of the R292K mutation was detected from 1 day (range 1-12 days) after oseltamivir treatment. As we could not collect the specimens and detect R292K before oseltamivir treatment, whether the R292K mutation occurred naturally or drug-induced could not be determined. The latest study showed that the emergence of an NA-R292K mutation infected with H7N9 was temporally associated with a high rebound virus load, treatment failure, and a poor clinical outcome [22] . We did not quantify the viral load in this study but did find that the emergence of the NA-R292K mutation delayed the viral shedding duration for the NA-R292K mutant patients, affecting the effects of antiviral therapy. Furthermore, recent and previous studies indicated that early oseltamivir treatment started 2 days before for H7N9 or 4 days before for H1N1 after disease onset would decrease the virus load or shorten the duration of viral shedding [14, 22] . In our study, the median initial time of oseltamivir treatment after symptom onset was 7 and 6 days for the two groups of patients.
