Recent improvements of matrix screens (also called array screens), use various pooling strategies as well as novel vectors that increase its efficiency while decreasing the false-negative rate, thus increasing reliability. In this chapter, we describe a screening strategy that systematically combines N-and C-terminal fusion proteins using a recently developed vector system. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method was originally developed by Stanley Fields and is a genetic method to detect binary proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) (1). It exploits the modularity of eukaryotic transcription factors and the ease of genetic engineering of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to monitor PPIs. A bait protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a prey protein is fused to the activation domain (AD) of a transcriptional activator, often the yeast Gal4 protein. The term \"two-hybrid\" is based on these two chimeric proteins. The bait and prey fusions are coexpressed in yeast and upon physical interaction between the bait and prey protein, the functional transcription factor (TF) is reconstituted. This results in the activation of a reporter gene, which allows either growth under selective conditions or produces a color or fluorescence signal (auxotrophic yeast strain, lacZ, or GFP reporter gene).",

            "text": "Yeast two-hybrid screens do not generate complete protein interactomes. As for any other detection method, it is almost impossible to detect all physiologically occurring interactants of every screened bait protein. Apart from effects that originate in the heterogenic yeast expression system, e.g., due to a lack of posttranslational modifications, false-negative interactions can be partly traced back to steric hindrance effects due to the used fusion tags. They can prevent physical interactions by covering the respective interaction sites or preventing subsequent transcriptional activation. Most Y2H vector systems use N-terminally fused test domains, but this can avoid any interactions which involve regions around the N-terminus of these proteins. Thus, we developed C-terminal fusions of the DNA-binding and activation domains and also tested pairwise combinations of N-and C-terminal fusions (2, 3). Stellberger et al. (2) tested all pairwise interactions among the ~70 ORFs of the Varicella Zoster Virus using both N-and C-terminal vectors as well as combinations thereof (Fig. 1 ). About ~20,000 individual Y2H tests resulted in 182 NN, 90 NC, 151 CN, and 146 CC interactions (Fig. 2) . Overlaps between screens ranged from 17% (NC-CN) to 43% (CN-CC). Performing four screens (i.e., permutations) instead of one resulted in about twice as many PPIs, and thus fewer false-negatives. Different vector combinations show unique, as well as overlapping PPI-data, supporting the impact of steric hindrance and the need of free termini for a subfraction of PPIs (Fig. 3 ).",

Mating: first, transfer baits with a sterile 384-pinning tool on YEPD mating plates and second, transfer preys onto baits.The rest of the procedure can be done according to the screening protocol. For interaction retesting diploids are pinned on -Leu-Trp-His selective media plates with different concentration of 3-AT. The control test position has to be compared to bait self-activation background signals. Reproducible interactions should show up on different concentrations of 3-AT, whereas the activation control test position indicates clearly no colony growth (see Note 16).1. Stock solutions can be stored up to 6 months at 4\u00b0C.Alternatively, the stock solutions can be frozen as aliquots at \u221220\u00b0C for long time storage.2. 1-Well plates are available from NUNC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Prepared agar plates should be stored for 1-2 days with closed lid under a sterile hood before use. Fresh solidified media is often wet and cannot be used directly.3. Medium concentrate can be stored at 4\u00b0C up to 6 months.4. Some components of the medium concentrate (e.g., amino acids) are not well soluble in water. The solution has to be stirred before the filtration step for up to 5 h until all components are dissolved. Heating is not recommended because of the heat sensitivity of amino acids.5. Selection media may differ due to the used Y2H expression vector system and have to be adapted. For instance, in the pDEST32/pDEST22 system the selection markers for baits and preys are interchanged (baits are selected on -Leu and preys on -Trp) while selection of pGBKT7g/pGBKCg baits is",
