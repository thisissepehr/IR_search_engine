The occurrence of the virus as four distinct serotypes raises many complications in the analysis and interpretation of serological data. Antibodies generated by exposure to any one strain are known to be cross-reactive for other strains, but they are believed only to provide strain-specific lifelong immunity to reinfection [1] . The immunological response on exposure to a second strain is complex and depends on factors such as patient age, strain type and the interval between exposure to one serotype and exposure to the second serotype. The high antibody titers attained after primary infection appear to generate a degree of cross-protection for a while, but if secondary exposure occurs after antibody levels begin to decline, cross-reactivity appears to act to enhance the growth rate of the new invading viral strain. This is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and its occurrence in dengue has been used to explain the etiology of serious disease (DHF and DSS) [3, 4, 5] .",

The relevant difference concerning disease transmissibility is that the force of infection varies accordingly to the number of previous infections which the hosts have experienced. Note that the number of dengue cases caused by a third or fourth dengue virus infection is extremely low and once confirmed, the risk for DHF relative to DF was not different for those experiencing third or fourth dengue virus infections over those experiencing a second dengue virus infection [14] . Therefore, individuals in a primary infection transmit the disease with a force of infection \u03b2 I/N whereas in a secondary infection the transmission is given with a force of infection \u03c6\u03b2 I/N where \u03c6 can be larger or smaller than unit, i.e. increasing or decreasing the transmission rate, due to the ADE effect. Individuals infected for the first time become recovered and life long immune to that given strain (R i ), with a recovery rate \u03b3 and after a period of temporary cross-immunity \u03b1, are again susceptible with a previous experienced infection (S i ). Individuals only get infected for the second time with a different strain than the one acquired during the first infection (I i j ), again with two possible infection rates, depending on who (individual on his primary or secondary infection) is transmitting the infection. Finally, they recover from the secondary infection (R) with recovery rate \u03b3. The death rates \u03bc coming out of all classes go into the class of susceptible without experiencing previous dengue infection as a birth rate. The parameter \u03c1 is the import factor, which captures the imported infection that comes from an external source.",

For four different strains, 1, 2, 3 and 4, we now label the SIR classes for the hosts that have seen the individual strains, again without epidemiological asymmetry between strains, once the serotype data are recent and very short to give any realistic information concerning difference in biological parameters such as infection and recovery rates for a given strain. Both models, the two-strain model (see Fig. 2c ), [15] ) and the four-strain model (see Fig. 2d )), show a qualitatively very good result when comparing empirical DHF data and simulation results, where patterns of the data behavior were similarly found to happen in the time series simulations.",
