However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (twenty-two nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labeled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for eightynine clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) provides approaches to viral diagnosis that have much greater scope. Thus, metagenomic analysis of HTS data can provide extensive viral genotyping information, as well as the characterization of complex multiple infections (Thorburn et al. 2015) . Several metagenomic pipelines using de novo assembly and homology matching have been developed for virus detection (Wang, Jia, and Zhao 2013; Scheuch, H\u00f6 per, and Beer 2015; Li et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2017; Maarala et al. 2018) .

Naive Bayes Classification (Rosen, Reichenberger, and Rosenfeld 2011) employs a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier to assign a log-likelihood score to each read. This classifier is trained by using a set of unique profiles of fifteen nucleotide k-mers from microbial genomes, and then allows users to upload the dataset to a web site and obtain a summary of results listing the best taxonomic match for each read. Kraken (Wood and Salzberg 2014) assigns each k-mer in the database to the last common ancestor of species having that k-mer, and then assigns each read to the taxon with the most matching k-mers. CoMeta (Kawulok and Deorowicz 2015) creates a database of all k-mers for each rank in the taxonomic tree, and then uses these databases to classify the reads at each rank. CLARK (Ounit et al. 2015) collects targetspecific k-mer sets from reference genomes belonging to a certain taxonomic rank (e.g. genus), and then classifies reads at that rank. This approach reduces the database size but requires a different database to be built for each rank. To improve the accuracy of the classification, CSSSCL (Borozan and Ferretti 2016) creates a BLAST database, a k-mer database and a compression database from a collection of reference genomes. Sequences in the sample are classified according to a combined sequence similarity score (CSSS) (Borozan, Watt, and Ferretti 2015) calculated from information in the pre-computed databases. In contrast to Kraken, CLARK, and CoMeta, all of which assign individual reads, MetaPalette (Koslicki and Falush 2016) profiles the entire dataset and returns the relative proportions of organisms present by using k-mer sizes of 30 and 50, based on the rationale that using two different k-mer sizes allows strain-level variation to be captured more accurately. Taxonomer (Flygare et al. 2016) compares each read to multiple reference databases, assigning it to a high-level taxonomic category on the basis of the k-mer content of the read, and then uses exact k-mer matching to assign each read to a reference by maximizing the total k-mer weight. This weight, which is a function of the kmer count in the reference and the database, provides a database-specific measure of how likely it is that a k-mer originated from a particular reference sequence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 168, "text": "(Rosen, Reichenberger, and Rosenfeld 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 511, "end": 535, "text": "(Wood and Salzberg 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 707, "end": 735, "text": "(Kawulok and Deorowicz 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 878, "end": 897, "text": "(Ounit et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1230, "text": "(Borozan and Ferretti 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1471, "text": "(Borozan, Watt, and Ferretti 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1649, "text": "(Koslicki and Falush 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1924, "text": "(Flygare et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Despite the growing number and popularity of k-mer-based classification tools, these tools have limitations.

It can be addressed by incorporating a range of variants into the database, but this creates a much larger database that may make the analysis challenging to run on resource-limited computers. Furthermore, many of the current tools are run on Linux systems and hence require the operator to have expertise in command line usage and an understanding of bioinformatics, which may be difficult to find in diagnostic settings. To our knowledge, the only tool that has been developed for ease of use and for application on computers with limited resources is Truffle (Visser, Burger, and Maree 2016) .

If k is small, many copies of shared k-mers are generated, and if k is large, many copies of virus k-mers are found. Choosing the optimal k-mer size depends on balancing the advantages of speed (small k) with those of specificity and sensitivity (large k). Furthermore, it is necessary to reduce the number of low-complexity k-mers in the virus k-mer database, as these may be repetitive in sequence and present in otherwise unrelated viruses.

The database build module involves selecting the relevant viral dataset, collecting the k-mers, and removing those that are shared with the host or are of low complexity.

The k-mers are further subdivided into those that exist in a single virus (i.e. specific k-mers) and those that exist in multiple viruses (i.e. nonspecific k-mers).

Although searching the trie is fast O(n), where n is the size of the k-mer, it requires O(n 2 ) overall time to build, and the space needed is quadratic. Instead, DisCVR uses a fast searching algorithm that groups similar k-mers together. Briefly, the k-mers in the virus database are divided among smaller sub-files according to the first five nucleotides. The same procedure is used to divide the k-mers derived from the entire HTS dataset. Searching commences by loading the corresponding sub-files from the virus k-mer database and the sample k-mers into memory, and performing a binary search for the presence of each sample k-mer among the database k-mers.

Consequently, the false positive results were assessed using the validation module (Table 2) , and the false negative results were investigated by examining the second hits recorded by DisCVR (Table 1 ). In most false positive cases, the validation module showed that there were multiple reads mapping (mean \u00bc 98 6 73 reads) to several regions of the reference genome (mean \u00bc 6 6 1% coverage of sites), thus confirming the presence of the viruses identified by DisCVR even though they had not been detected by RT-PCR. Some samples had low coverage because a single RefSeq sequence in the validation represented the entire species but diverged in sequence from the virus present in the sample. For example, sample 1B3 yielded HRV-A89 (the reference for species Rhinovirus A) as the top hit, with only 7.6 per cent genome coverage and four mapped reads. Using the capability of DisCVR to build a customized database drawn from the 100 prototypic strains of Rhinovirus A, HRV-A49 was revealed as the top hit, with 81.71 per cent genome coverage and 263 mapped reads. This dramatic improvement illustrates the potential to strengthen the validation module by adding user-specific curated sets of sequences or by the proposed expansion of RefSeq entries capturing a greater degree of diversity (Brister et al. 2015) . In the sixteen false negative cases, DisCVR detected the virus identified by RT-PCR as the top hit in three samples (1G2, 1I5, and 2B6), but the number of distinct k-mers was <850 (Table 1; Supplementary  Table S2 ). In addition, the virus identified by RT-PCR was detected as the second hit in 10 samples (1B5, 1D3, 1E5, 1G1, 1F7, 1F8, 2A2, 2B9, 2C4, and 2D3) , and, in one case (1C2), the RT-PCR assay did not have the potential of identifying the top hit (enterovirus D). An important finding was made in two of these samples (1B5 and 1D3), in which the viruses detected by RT-PCR were not the top hits but still had 850 distinct k-mers in the sample (Table 1 ). This suggests that these patients were infected by multiple viruses. Finally, DisCVR did not detect any k-mers for the virus detected by RT-PCR in two samples (1C9 and 2D4), but identified HRV-A in 1C9, which was validated by reference assembly. The validation module thus yielded strong evidence for the presence of the viruses detected by DisCVR, at least where the number of k-mers was 850. These findings were taken into account in reassessing the sensitivity and specificity of DisCVR at 79 and 100 per cent, respectively (Fig. 4) . The optimal threshold for CLARK and Kraken based on the ROC curves suggests 150 reads as the threshold. Recalculating the sensitivity and specificity based on this threshold gave values of 70.7 and 91.7 per cent for CLARK and 68.7 and 76 per cent for Kraken.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1491, "end": 1512, "text": "(Brister et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1875, "text": "(1B5, 1D3, 1E5, 1G1, 1F7, 1F8, 2A2, 2B9, 2C4, and 2D3)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 285, "end": 294, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 394, "end": 402, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1728, "text": "(Table 1; Supplementary  Table S2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2177, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2708, "end": 2716, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The threshold of 850 k-mers was also used in the analysis of the Nigerian datasets (Stremlau et al. 2015) .

In nine cases, the top hit from DisCVR differed from the top BLAST hit, but the second hit matched. In fifty-five cases, the number of k-mers was below the threshold in DisCVR, and the number of reads with BLAST matches was also low (an average of twenty-four reads per dataset). In the remaining twelve discordant samples, DisCVR detected human immunodeficiency virus 1 (n \u00bc 9), XMRVrelated virus (n \u00bc 1), and human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (n \u00bc 1) as the top hit, whereas the BLAST results supported the presence of human ADV or Heterosigma akashiwo RNA virus (an algal virus).

However, the uptake of HTS in such settings has been slow, due partly to the cost, turnover time and bioinformatic demands of this technology. We developed DisCVR to help address these challenges. DisCVR is a fast, accurate program for detecting viruses from HTS data using the increasingly exploited approach of k-mer classification. the advantage of a non-targeted approach and also enables typing below the species level (e.g. subtype, serotype, genotype, or strain). Unlike other tools for detecting viruses from HTS data, DisCVR is easy to use in diagnostic settings through the GUI, requires no bioinformatic expertise, and can be used on the Windows operating systems that are commonly used in diagnostic laboratories. The basic output is easy to interpret, and the advanced output provides more detailed statistics and a validation capability. DisCVR was designed for detecting known viruses and cannot be used to discover novel viruses. Indeed, the paper on the Nigerian patients (Stremlau et al. 2015) reported novel rhabdoviruses in healthy patients using a metagenomic approach, and these were not detected by DisCVR. However, metagenomics requires bioinformatic infrastructure and expertise at levels that are not commonly available in diagnostic laboratories. Nonetheless, DisCVR enables the detection of 148 pathogenic human viruses using one of the three implemented datasets (the pathogenic dataset), and more using the others. This represents a greater than ten-fold increase in target species over multiplex RT-PCR. Moreover, the number of viruses incorporated into the DisCVR databases is flexible and can also be expanded by building custom databases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1135, "end": 1157, "text": "(Stremlau et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the datasets from respiratory tract infections, DisCVR had high sensitivity and specificity levels but did not identify all the viruses detected by RT-PCR when the threshold of 850 k-mers was used.

As more datasets with paired information become available, it will be possible to tune the threshold more accurately to specific sample types and sizes.
