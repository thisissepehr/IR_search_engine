Although several disease processes are possible explanations for this patient's pathology, one likely diagnosis will become clear through our discussion. Travel from Southeast Asia. With over 500 million people crossing international borders each year, the potential for emerging pathogens to be spread from other geographic regions is greater than ever. 1 Over a decade ago, the Institute of Medicine identified travel as one of six major factors related to the emergence and re-emergence of tropical disease. 2 Several years later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released Addressing Emerging Infectious Disease Threats: A Prevention Strategy for the United States; in this doctrine international travelers, refugees, and immigrants are targeted as a priority group for infectious disease surveillance. 3 The updated 1998 document from the CDC entitled Preventing Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Strategy for the 21 st Century continues to identify international travelers as a high-risk population that has contributed to the spread of these diseases. 4 The CDC recommendations are in part the result of the concern that many tropical and developing countries contain infectious pathogens not common to the United States. These diseases, such as malaria, plague, dengue fever, and yellow fever, have explosive potential if introduced in this country in sufficient quantity. For symptomatic patients who recently have immigrated to the United States, the potential for diagnosis of these unusual pathogens is significant. New emigrants from developing countries are at particular risk for infectious disease. This population frequently does not utilize appropriate pretravel medical care, may not be appropriately or completely vaccinated, and may experience living or working conditions that place them at higher risk for virulent infectious diseases. 5 Additionally, genetic variations in the immune system of immigrants and lack of exposure to antigens on indigenous infectious organisms can contribute to the development of an infection soon after entering a new country. A significant number of immigrants who develop medical complaints will seek primary medical care through the ED. These patients are particularly challenging because of language barriers, atypical presentations of diseases, self-medication with atypical treatments before arrival, and a lack of physician familiarity of indigenous infections from the country of origin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 791, "end": 792, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1263, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1513, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2312, "end": 2313, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FACULTY DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Upto 3% of individuals will complain of fever in the period immediately after travel. 6 The evaluation of the febrile immigrant begins with a thorough pretravel history regarding the living conditions in the country of origin, the patient's vaccination history, and any pretravel health care.

Aseptic meningitis may ensue, but even severe cases are associated with good recovery. 20 Melioidosis, or Whitmore's disease, is caused by infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei. A handful of cases are confirmed in the United States each year, seen exclusively in travelers and immigrants, especially from Southeast Asia, where it is endemic. Transmission occurs through either direct person-to-person contact, direct contact with contaminated soil and surface water, or inhalation. Acute infection with melioidosis can produce fever and general muscle aches, and may progress rapidly to infect the bloodstream. The acute, localized form of infection presents as a nodule and results from inoculation through a break in the skin. The pulmonary form of the disease presents with symptoms consistent with a mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia. The onset of pulmonary melioidosis is typically accompanied by a high fever, headache, anorexia, and general muscle soreness. Chest pain is common, but a nonproductive or productive cough with normal sputum is the hallmark of this form of melioidosis.

The incidence of tuberculosis has been rising over the past decades. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 4 million new cases occur annually. 27 It is reported that more than 95% of these cases are in developing countries such as Indonesia. 28 In the United States, more than 22,000 cases are reported annually. 29 Tuberculous pericarditis is thought to occur in 2% of all instances of pulmonary tuberculosis. 29 Worldwide, tuberculosis is the leading cause of pericarditis. In the United States, it is the leading cause of immunodeficiency-related pericarditis. 30 The typical symptoms of this disease are cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Additionally, night sweats, orthopnea, and weight loss are common. Cardiomegaly, pericardial rub, fever, and tachycardia are frequent signs. 31 The mycobacterium spreads to the pericardium either by direct extension from the lungs or by a hematogenous route. The resultant effusion is thought to be caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the tuberculoprotein. Proinflammatory cytokines are implicated as the etiology of symptoms such as fever, weakness, and weight loss. 31 Cardiomegaly caused by pericardial effusion frequently is evident on chest radiography. However, fewer than half of the patients may have radiographic evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. 32 Characteristic ECG findings of tuberculous pericarditis are lowvoltage QRS waves and inverted T waves. However, these findings are present only in a minority of cases and are not diagnostic. 29 Similarly, echocardiogram findings are nonspecific. Evidence of pericardial effusion with possible pericardial thickening is suggestive of the diagnosis. Rarely, there may be evidence of cardiac tamponade. 31 Definitive diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis requires isolation of M. tuberculosis. A positive tuberculin skin test may increase the suspicion for the diagnosis; however, a negative test does not exclude it. Given the difficulty of isolating the bacteria, pericardial fluid culture is neither reliable nor timely. In fact, culture of the fluid reveals the diagnosis in only 30% of the cases. 27 A pericardial tissue specimen has a higher yield for isolation of the bacteria. When a large pericardial effusion is present, an open biopsy along with a pericardial window serves as both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. 31 Antibiotic therapy mimics the same dose and length as that of pulmonary tuberculosis. Resolution of the pericarditis is expected within three months in 80% of patients. 32 Before the advent of modern antituberculosis drug therapy, mortality rates of up to 85% were noted. With current therapy, the mortality rate has decreased to 50%. 29 Constrictive pericarditis develops in 30% to 50% of patients despite medical therapy. 32 Thus, the placement of a pericardial window generally is recommended in the treatment of tuberculous pericarditis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 238, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 335, "end": 337, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 406, "end": 408, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 504, "end": 506, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 657, "end": 659, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 874, "end": 876, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1208, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1398, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1592, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1801, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2200, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2431, "end": 2433, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2605, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2769, "end": 2771, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2860, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESIDENT DISCUSSION AND CASE OUTCOME"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Travel and the emergence of infectious diseases", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Wilson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1995, "venue": "Emerg Infect Dis", "volume": "1", "issn": "", "pages": "39--46", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "d www.aemj.org 2.
