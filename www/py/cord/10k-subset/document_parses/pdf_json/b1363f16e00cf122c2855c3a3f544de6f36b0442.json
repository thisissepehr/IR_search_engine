Curative therapy incorporates surgery and is burdensome with high rates of infection morbidity and mortality. The role of yeast as causative organisms of post-esophagectomy infections is poorly defined. Consequently, the benefits of specific antifungal prophylactic therapy in improving patient outcome are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the incidence of yeast infections at the University Medical Center Groningen among 565 post-esophagectomy patients between 1991 and 2017. The results show that 7.3% of the patients developed a yeast infection after esophageal resection with significantly increased incidence among patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. For patients with yeast infections, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, more frequent intensive care unit readmissions, prolonged hospital stays and higher mortality rates were observed. One-year survival was significantly lower for patients with a yeast infection, as well as diabetes mellitus and yeast-positive pleural effusion. We conclude that the incidence of yeast infections following esophagectomy is considerable, and that patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk.

A systematic review by Li and colleagues demonstrated a link between anastomotic leakage and DM in esophagectomy patients following a similar conclusion in general abdominal surgery patients 27, 28 . We identified anastomotic leakage as the most prevalent underlying etiology of complications (Fig. 2) , which is consistent with the results of Raymond et al. who illustrated 12.0% anastomotic leakage and 12.2% pneumonia in 4321 esophagectomy patients 2 . However, the results of our current study provide no evidence for the same incidence of documented pneumonia. Given the link between cervical anastomotic leakage and pulmonary and polymicrobial infections, the relationship between DM and the development of yeast infection is likely based on a multifaceted interaction. Polymicrobial positive culture from pleural effusion can be logically explained, in this patient category, by cervical anastomotic leakage. Accordingly, the presence of gastro-intestinal microbial flora on pleural fluid culture is usually part of the diagnostic tree. Further, it should be noted that diagnosis of anastomotic leakage is often difficult as current radiological investigations are non-specific. It is therefore conceivable that the prevalence of yeast infection can be attributed to an increased incidence of anastomotic leakage in DM patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 259, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 379, "end": 381, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 578, "end": 581, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 680, "end": 688, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Patients with a yeast infection showed a 2.5-fold increase in mean length of hospital stay compared to the overall group, which can be explained by the increased therapy and critical care support these patients are known to require.

Firstly, the distinction of yeast infection from colonization is challenging and, accordingly, there is no universally adopted definition 11, 29 . Therefore, we have reduced potential diagnostic ambiguity by incorporating current clinical practice and guidelines 30 . It is important to emphasize that the colonized patients were those who had shown a positive yeast culture on routine sampling. However, one should bear in mind that yeast is a component of the human mucosal microbiota despite not always being cultured. It is also necessary to mention the sporadic use of SDD in some patients in our study, which involved the administration of an oral, non-absorbable paste with enteral antibiotics including amphotericin B, tobramycin and colistin, as well as intravenous administration of cefotaxime. This was not a global policy adopted by all of the ICUs within the UMCG and, therefore, the numbers are believed to be small. From October 2005 to April 2006 the SDD-regimen was infrequently used as part of a clinical trial 12 . Additionally, from the summer of 2013, some of this patient cohort may have received SDD. This was introduced as a general infection prevention measure in the ICU following the aforementioned trial, but not used in all esophagectomy patients.

These patients are not routinely subject to antifungal therapy. Patients with yeast in their pleural drain fluid showed a diminished survival and therefore, it seems that even the presence of yeast is indicative for survival outcome. However, we recognize this could be the result of increased antimicrobial administration in critically ill patients, resulting in yeast overgrowth. Further, yeast colonization was detected by sputum or throat cultures in the pre-or early post-operative period. From the numbers shown in Table 1 , no significant effect of colonization on yeast infection can be inferred. However, the diagnostic microbiology laboratory did not consistently report all yeast in sputum cultures during this period and patients were not routinely screened for yeast colonization.
