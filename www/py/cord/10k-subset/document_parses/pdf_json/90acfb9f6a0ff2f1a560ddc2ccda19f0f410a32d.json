Poly(A) + mRNA fractions from the 23-32 S area of a sucrose gradient were used to build a cDNA library in the expression vector 2gtl 1 with an efficiency of cloning of approximately 104 recombinants/ng mRNA. Recombinant clones were screened with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the corn nitrate reductase, which cross reacts specifically with the nitrate reductases from dicotyledons. Among 240000 recombinant plaques, eight clones were isolated containing inserts of sizes ranging from 1.6 kb to 2.1 kb and sharing sequence homologies. Seven of these clones contained a common internal 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment. The identity of these clones was confirmed as follows. A fusion protein of 170 kDa inducible by IPTG and recognized by the rabbit nitrate reductase antibody was expressed by a lysogen derived from one of the recombinants. The antibodies binding the fused protein were eluted and shown to be inhibitory to the catalytic activity of tobacco nitrate reductase. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against nitrate reductase were also able to bind the hybrid protein. The 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment was sequenced by the method of Sanger. The open reading frame corresponding to a translational fusion with the /~-galactosidase coding sequence of the vector shared strong homology at the amino acid level with the berne-binding domain of proteins of the cytochrome b5 superfamily and with human erythrocyte cytochrome b5 reductase. When the 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment was used as a probe for Northern blot experiments a signal corresponding to a 3.5 kb RNA was detected in tobacco and in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia mRNA preparations but no cross-hybridization with corn mRNAs was detected. The probe hybridized with low copy number sequences in genomic blots of tobacco DNA.",

            "text": "Nitrate reductase (NR) is a key enzyme involved in the first step of nitrate assimilation in plants (Kleinhofs et al. 1985) , and is also found in bacteria and fungi. Although in these different organisms it catalyzes a similar reduction of nitrate involving NADH or NADPH as electron donor, the enzyme displays a variety of structures and dissimilarities. In Escherichia coli the enzyme is an heterotrimer bound to the bacterial membrane (Rasul Chaudhry and MacGregor 1953) and in ChloreIla NR is an homotetramer (Howard and Solomonson 1982) found in the pyrenoid. In plants the enzyme is an homodimer possibly interacting with the chloroplast outer membrane. Apart from NADH, the three other cofactors involved in the reduction of nitrate by NR are FAD, cytochrome b557 and the molybdenum cofactor. The NR from several plant species have been purified to homogeneity (Redinbaugh and Campbell 1985; Campbell and Wray 1983) ; and shown to catalyze, apart from nitrate reduction, other reactions, such as the reduction of ferric ion (Campbell and Redinbaugh 1984) , which may be of physiological significance. The subunits of these plant NR have a molecular weight close to 110 kDa.",

Molecular tools have been lacking to study more deeply the features of these regulations and, for instance, NR monoclonal antibodies have been available only recently. Nucleic acid probes would be useful for studying the transcription of the NR structural gene under various physiological conditions.

Two hundred nanograms of total poly(A) + mRNAs were heat-denatured at 70 \u00b0 C for 2 min in water, and reverse transcribed at pH 8.3 using 14 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Genofit) in a final volume of 40 lal in the presence of 0.1 lag oligo(dT) (15 mers, Pharmacia) at 42 \u00b0 C for 40 rain. The efficiency of synthesis of the first strand varied from 8%-25%. The second strand was synthesized from the first strand in the presence of 0.8 U of RNAse H (BRL), and 4 U of E. Coli DNA ligase (Biolabs) using 40 U of DNA Pol I holoenzyme (Amersham) in a 90 lal final volume. The incubation was performed at 12\u00b0C for 1 h and then at 16\u00b0C for an additional hour. The double stranded DNA was healed by incubation with 1 U ofT4 DNA polymerase at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The effi-ciency of synthesis of the second strand was close to 100%. The cDNA obtained (approximately 100 ng) was subsequently methylated with 20 U of EcoRI methylase. To improve the efficiency of cloning (tenfold) a step of S1 nuclease treatment followed by a second healing step was included in the procedure of cDNA synthesis between the healing and methylation steps, cDNAs were treated with 2 U of S1 nuclease (Boehringer) in a volume of 100 lal for 15 min at 30\u00b0C in order to eliminate abnormal ends, as suggested by Lapeyre (1985) . This resulted in a 5% decrease in the amount of high molecular weight material in the cDNA preparation. After addition of EcoRI linkers to the cDNA (phosphorylated 12 mers, PL Biochemicals) and two successive digestions with concentrated EcoRI, cDNAs were fractionated on a Sephacryl $300 column and the material corresponding to cDNAs larger than 0.5 kb was pooled. The cDNA was ligated with dephosphorylated 2gtl 1 vector cut with EeoRI under conditions specified by Young and Davis (1983) . The ligation mixture was packaged using commercially available packaging lysates (Gigapack, Clontech labs, CA). Libraries were checked for the proportion of recombinants on strain RY1088 in the presence of XGal and IPTG: they contained 70%-80% white plaques. A significant proportion of these white plaques detected in the first libraries turned to pale blue upon retesting on strain RY1090, and were lacking detectable inserts. This was found to be related to the poor elimination of small cDNA fragments and linkers by chromatography on Sepharose 4B columns and was improved by using Sephacryl $300. After optimization, yields were approximately 50000-100000 white plaques per nanogram cDNA, among which 50% contained detectable inserts.",

The isolation and characterization of the monoclonal antibody 96(9)25, which inhibits the activity of various plant nitrate reductases, has been described previously (Ch6rel et al. 1985) . Several monoclonal antibodies recognizing the tobacco enzyme have been obtained using a similar procedure (C. Meyer, unpublished results). The monoclonal antibodies 7(113)NP15 and 24(48)NP19 recognize native NR from tobacco but have no effect on the activity of the enzyme. Recognition of the fusion protein using monoclonal antibodies was performed using a two sites ELISA test according to a previously described procedure (Ch6rel et al. 1986 ). Reactants were added to the microtitration plates in the following order: monoclonal anti- Phage DNA preparation, subcloning of inserts and DNA sequencing. Bacterial and phage procedures were essentially as in Miller (1972) . The strains used are described by Huynh et al. (1985) . Phage production, purification and DNA extraction were performed according to the procedure of Huynh et al. (1985) described for ,~gtl0.",

This hybrid protein was also detected after Coomassie blue staining of the corresponding SDS-PAGE fractionated extracts (Fig. 3) . No hybrid protein was detected in a lysogen for phage 13-36. These results are in agreement with the insert of clone 13-29 being integrated in frame with the coding sequence of/~-galactosidase and encoding a polypeptide chain of an approximate size of 60 kDa, which is in reasonable agreement with the size of the corresponding cDNA insert. The isolation by immunological screening of clone 13-36 carrying an insert oriented opposite to the/~-galactosidase gene, and the study of the corresponding lysogen, confirm the weak expression of inserted sequences under the control of another phage promoter in 2gtl 1, as previously discussed (Lapeyre 1985) . The absence of detection of hybrid proteins in Western blots of extracts from a lysogen of the recombinant clone 13-36 may be attributed to the low level of expression of this hybrid protein.

Inhibition of the catalytic activity of tobacco nitrate reductase (NR) by immunoglobulins immunoselected by adsorption on plaques formed by phages 2gtll and 13 29 grown in the presence of IPTG. Immunoglobulins were added in the enzyme incubation mixture at the indicated dilution, based on the initial amount of antiserum used for adsorption on phage plaques. Immune antiserum c~MNR adsorbed on 2gtll plaques (e) or on recombinant clone 13-29 plaques (D). Non-immune antiserum ~So adsorbed on plaques from clone 13-29 (o). A small but significant stimulation of NR activity was induced by adding non-immune antiserum (~So) in the preparation of nitrate reductase. This is attributed to a stabilizing effect of serum proteins on the enzyme. The specific activity of the extract was 0.4 pM NOz/pg protein per minute strain RY 1090 lawns were infected by phages 2 g t l l and 13-29. After induction with I P T G the synthesized proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose filters. Control (eSo) and ~M N R polyclonal antibodies were incubated with the filters and the corresponding immunoselected immunoglobulins were eluted from the filters at low pH. These selected antibodies were then assayed for their ability to inhibit the nitrate reducing activity of tobacco NR. As shown in Fig. 4 , a 40% inhibition of tobacco N R activity was obtained with a 1/200 dilution of the selected immunoglobulins, in reasonable agreement with the inhibitory activity of the c~MNR serum (70% inhibition with a 1/200 dilution of this serum). Proteins expressed by clone 13-29 could bind specifically antibodies inhibitory to the tobacco N R in the c~MNR serum. This suggests also that the amount of hybrid protein available for imnmnoselection was in excess of the amount of immunoglobulins to be adsorbed in the serum. Indeed we found that c~MNR antiserum used for the confirmation of immunologically positive clones could not be used for further screening of new recombinants, probably due to a depletion of immunoglobulins directed against NR.",

At least two different epitopes can be detected on the hybrid protein that are also recognized on tobacco NR. The absence of the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 7(113)NP15 shows also, as expected, that tobacco N R and the hybrid protein are antigenically different, due to a lack of part of the N R coding sequence in the cloned cDNA.",

A family of clones was isolated by immunological screening of a cDNA library built in Fig. 8 . Southern blot analysis of tobacco genomic sequences homologous to the 1.6 kb EeoRI insert from phage 2 13-29. Lane 1, molecular weight markers; lane 2, 10 ttg of tobacco genomic DNA digested with EeoRI, probed with the 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment (sp. acty. 10 9 cpm/pg, 3 days autoradiography); lane 3, 1 gg of the same DNA cut by EcoRI probed with the wheat rDNA sequences from plasmid pTA71 (sp. act. 108 cpm/gg, I day autoradiography) the expression vector 2gtll. These recombinant clones encode polypeptide fragments sharing homologies with the active site of the nitrate reductase from tobacco. The cloned fragments hybridize with a 3.5 kb mRNA species and to low copy number genomic sequences. These cloned sequences have been confirmed to correspond to fragments of the nitrate reductase mRNA by sequence data analysis. Plant and fungal nitrate reductases contain a cytochrome b557 domain (Redinbaugh and Campbell 1985) . As shown by L~ and Lederer (1983) by amino acid sequencing, the heme-binding domain of Neurospora crassa nitrate reductase is a member of the cytochrome b5 superfamily. Our results show that the tobacco enzyme also shows a significant homology with different members of the superfamily. The cytochrome b5 homology entirely covered the berne-binding domain of the various proteins: we thus propose that this sequence defines the heine-binding domain of tobacco nitrate reductase. All the 13 conserved residues of the superfamily (Lederer et al. 1983 ) are present in our tobacco NR sequence, which appears to be closer to chicken cytochrome b5 than to any other member of the superfamily. The relative dissimilarity between the plant and fungal nitrate reductases indicates a divergent evolution for that enzyme. Since X-ray determinations of the spatial structure of beef microsomal cytochrome b5 (Mathews et al. 197J ) and flavocytochrome b2 (Xia et al. 1987 ) have been performed, it is hoped from the observed homology that the three dimensional conformations will be predictable.",

This protein is known to catalyse the reduction of cytochrome b5, using NADH as an electron donor and FAD as a redox intermediate. This may be functionally compared to the catalytic reaction of nitrate reduction involving NADH, FAD, and cytochrome b5 as cofactors. The suggestion is that this second homologous sequence is the N-terminal moiety of' the NADH/FAD domain of tobacco nitrate reductase. Nitrate reductase would therefore appear to be a protein in which the heme-binding site and the reducing flavoprotein domain lie side by side in the polypeptide chain. To the best of our knowledge no sequences are available for the rnolybdopterin-binding domain from redox enzymes, which would be helpful to further analyse the functional structure of assimilatory nitrate reductases.",

Cell-free translation data and Northern experiments suggest that the corresponding mRNA accounts for approximately 1/10000 of total poly(A) + mRNA. The frequency of immunologically positive clones isolated from the cDNA library is 1/20000. This value seems low since this library was made from purified mRNAs and should contain one NR cDNA among 1000-2000 recombinants. When the library was screened by hybridization with the 1.6 kb EcoRI fragment it was found that indeed the proportion of inserts homologous to the probe was larger (1/5000). We conclude that most of these cDNAs were too small to express an immunogenic protein. The library was screened with a polyclonal antibody raised against the corn NR. The preferential isolation of relatively similar cDNAs may reflect the limited number of epitopes that can be recognized on tobacco NR by an antiserum raised against a heterologous NR. Previous work has shown that among six different epitopes of the corn NR identified by a family of monoclonal antibodies, only one epitope, a conformational epitope involved in the catalytic activity of the enzyme, was found on the tobacco enzyme (Ch6rel et al. 1985) . This epitope is apparently also present on the hybrid protein expressed by recombinant clone 13-29. It will be of interest to see whether the hybrid protein is able to catalyze some of the oxidoreductive steps involved in nitrate reduction by nitrate reductase.",

A probe corresponding to part of the NR apoenzyme coding sequence will be useful to analyse these mutants which belong to seven different complementation groups (Mfiller AJ and Gabard J, unpublished results; Gabard et al. 1987) , and to study the NR structural gene.

Among the six possible reading frames of the sequence only one is uninterrupted by stop codons and encodes a polypeptide chain of 554 amino acids with a molecular mass of 62175kDa. This open reading frame corresponds to a translational fusion with the flanking fl-galactosidase sequence of the vector, and represents about 55% of the expected size of the tobacco nitrate reductase apoenzyme. Codon usage is biased (data not shown); the C U G codon for Leu and U C G for Ser are never used.A computer search was undertaken for homologies to sequences in the PIR data base (release 11) or deduced from open reading frame sequences in Genbank (releaseatcggc GAA TTC CCT TGT AGA GAA Glu Phe Pro Cys Arg Glu GGT TTC AAC TGG GGC GCC GeT GCC Gly Phe Ash Trp Gly Ala Ala Ala AAG AAT AAA GGG GCG CTT AAT GTT Lys Asn Lys Gly Ala Leu Ash Val GAA TTT GCA ATG GAT CCA GCA CGA Glu PHe Ala Met Asp Pro Ala Arg ATG ATA ATT CCA GGA TTC ATT GGA Met lle lie Pro Gly Phe lle Gly TTC AAG GAC AAT AGA GTT CTT CCT Phe Lys Asp Asn Arg Val Leu Pro GAG CTT AAT ATT AAC TCT GTC ATT Glu Leu Ash lle Asn Set Val lle AGG GGC TAT TCT TAT TCT GGC GGA Arg Gly Tyr Set Tyr Ser Gly Gly GAT CAC CCA GAG AAG CCC ACC AAA Asp His Pro Glu Lys Pro Thr Lys AAA GAA ATT GCT GTT CGA GCT TGG Lys Glu lie Ala Val Arg Ala Trp TGG TTC CGA GTA AAG ATG AAT GTG Trp Phe Arg Val Lys Met Ash Val GGT GGA TGG ATG GCG AAG GAG AGA Gly Gly Trp Met Ala Lys Glu Arg ACA GeT TCC AAG ATG TAC TCC ATG Thr Ala Ser Lys Met Tyr Set Met GCC ACG CGT TTC TTG AAA GAT CAC Ala Thr Ar T Phe Leu Lys Asp His CAT TCT GAT AAG GCT AAG AAG CTC His Set Asp Lys Ala Lys Lys Leu GTG CAC GGA TCT TCT TCC TTC AGC Val His Gly Set Set Set Phe Set AAA ATe CCA TGC AAA CTC ATe GAC Lys lie Pro Cys Lys Leu lie Asp GGC TTG CCT GTT GGA AAA CAT ATe G I~ Leu Pro Val Gly Lys His lie TTG CCC GTT ACG CTT GTT TGT GCT Leu Pro Val Thr Leu Val Cys Ala GTT TeA ACA ACG ATA TGG CGC GGG Val Set Thr Thr lle Trp Arg Gly TGC TTC GAA GGA GeT GAT GTG TTG Cys Phe Glu Gly Ala Asp Val Leu GAT ATC ATe GTA GCC TAC ATG CAG Asp lle lla Val Ala Tyr Met Gln GGA AGA ATG GTG AAA TGG ATA AAG Gly Arg Met Val Lys Trp lie Lys CCC CAT GTT GAT GeT GAA CTT GCA Pro His Val Asp Ala Glu Leu Ala ACG ACG CCG TGT CAT GAA GAA ATT Thr Thr Pro Cys His Glu GIn lie GGG AAA AAA GTA ACG CGA GTA GAA Gly Lys Lys Val Thr Arg Val Glu TAT GGC AAG TAC TGG TGT TGG TGC Tyr Gly Lys Tyr Trp Cys Trp Cys GAT GAG ACC CTC AAT ACT CAA CCC Asp Glu Thr Leu Ash Thr Gin Pro TGC AAG CCT CAC AAG GGA GAG ATT Cys Lys Pro His Lys Gly Glu lie CAT TTG GAG ATA TCA GCA GAG GCA His Leu Glu lle Set Ala Glu Ala TCC GAG GTC AGG AAA CAC AGC TCT Ser Glu Val Ar~ Lys His Set Ser CCT GGT GGG ACT GAC AGC ATT CTC Pro Gly Gly Thr Asp Set lie Leu TTG GAG GAT TTC AGG ATT GGT GAA Leu Glu Asp Phe Ar~ lle,Gly Glu AGe TTT CTA GCA CCT ATT AAG GAA Ser Phe Leu Ala Pro lie Lys Glu AAG CAA TCC ATC TCC CAT GAT GTT Lys Gin Set lie Ser His Asp Val TTC CTC TGT GCC GTT ATT GAC GAT Phe Leu Cys Ala Val lie ATA GTC ACC ACC CAA Arg lle lie Val Thr Thr Gin AAT ACe GAA GCA TGG TGG TAC Ash Thr Glu Ala Trp Trp Tyr TTG CCA ATT AAC GCC TGG ACG Leu Pro lle Ash Ala Trp Thr GTG ACG TTG GAT GGA GGA GAA Val Thr Leu Asp Gly Gly Glu TTT TGG TeA CTC GAG GTT GAG Phe Trp Ser Leu Glu Val Glu GAG AAG CTT ATT TG~ AAC GTC Glu Lys Leu lie Trp Asn Val GGA ATA GTG TTT GAG CAT CCG Gly lle Val Phe Glu His Pro CCT CAA ACA CTA AAG AAG AGT Pro Gin Thr Leu Lys Lys Set GCT GAC TCT GCT TGG ATe ATA Ala Asp Set Ala Trp lie lle ATC AAT GeT GGC ACT GAT TGC lie Ash Ala GI~ Thr Asp Cys CTC ATA ACT ACT GGT TAC ACC Leu lle Thr Thr Gly Tyr Thr CTT GTT CCA GCG CAG AGG AGT Leu Val Pro Ala Gln Arg Set AGG AAA TTT CGA TTT GCA TTG Ar T Lys Phe Ar~ Phe Ala Leu AAG CTC TGC ATG CGC GCT TAC Lys Leu Cys Met Arg ACT CCA TTC ATG AAC 1080 lle Set Thr Pro Phe Met Ash 358 GTC CAT GGT CAT ATC TAT GAC 1170 Val His Gly His lie Tyr Asp 388 ACT GAG GAA TTT GAT GCA ATT 1260 Thr Glu Glu Phe Asp Ala lle 418 TCT GAC TCT CCT GGC AAC TCC 1350 Set Asp Set Pro Gly Ash Ser 448 GTG GCC eTA ATT CCA AGA GAG 1440 Val Ala Leu lie Pro Ar~ Glu 478 CCC TCT GAG GAT CAA GTC TTG 1530 Pro Set Glu Asp Gin Val Leu 508 ACG CCT ACT AGe ACG ATC GAT 1620 Thr Pro Thr Sat Thr lle A \u00a7~ 538 GAG GTG GGG TAC TTC GAG TTG GTT GTC AAG ATA TAC TTC AAA GGA ATT cca 1671 Glu Val Gly Tyr Phe Glu Leu Val Val Lys lle Tyr Phe Lys GIv lie Nueleotide sequence of the eDNA insert from recombinant phage 2 13 29 and the predicted amino acid sequence of the eDNAencoded part of the fusion protein expressed by this phage.
