Methods: We performed a case-control study of 321 patients fulfilling international criteria for severe sepsis and ARDS who were admitted to a Spanish network of post-surgical and critical care units, as well as 871 population-based controls. Six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NFE2L2 were genotyped, and, after further imputation of additional 34 SNPs, association testing with ARDS susceptibility was conducted using logistic regression analysis. Results: After multiple testing adjustments, our analysis revealed 10 non-coding SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium (0.75 \u2264 r 2 \u2264 1) that were associated with ARDS susceptibility as a single association signal.

Under physiological conditions, oxygen metabolism generates small amounts of ROS, although the cells have several antioxidant mechanisms against oxidative damage. A disruption of oxidant-antioxidant balance is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory conditions, including sepsis and ARDS [5] . The nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2, also known as NRF2 or NFE2L2, plays a central role in the antioxidant mechanisms against ROS. NFE2L2 is a member of the Cap'n'Collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor family and constitutes a hub, controlling the expression of several genes involved in regulating cellular antioxidant levels and detoxification [6] . The NFE2L2 gene maps onto chromosome 2 at 2q31. Upon activation by an increase in cellular levels of ROS, NFE2L2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE), inducing the transcription of NFE2L2-regulated genes [6] . In previous positional cloning studies in experimental animals, researchers have identified NFE2L2 as a candidate gene for hyperoxia-induced lung injury susceptibility [7, 8] . These results were validated in humans, in whom common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by resequencing analysis and candidate SNP functionality was proven in cell lines.

Although these SNPs were widely distributed across the gene, all of them showed strong LD with each other. One of the associated SNPs, rs6721961, which showed a minor allele frequency of 11.1 % in this sample, was located in the promoter region of the gene, and its T-allele had been previously linked to a reduction in functionality that limited the NFE2L2 triggering of the antioxidative response [9] . Consistent with those findings, we found that the T allele at rs6721961 conferred greater risk for ARDS susceptibility in patients with sepsis than in healthy subjects. A functional evaluation of the associated SNPs with empirical data from the ENCODE project revealed that seven of them are located in histone marks and/or on DNase I hypersensitivity sites (Table 3) . Specifically, the SNP rs6721961 locates in a promoter histone mark in lung fibroblasts and fetal lung. It is also located in a DNase I hypersensitivity site, as reported in an epithelial cell line derived from a lung carcinoma tissue. Given that chromatin modifications on histone marks are critically involved in the regulation of gene expression and that these regions tend to collocate with DNase-sensitive sites in transcriptional start sites [31] , this evidence highlights the key role of rs6721961 in the regulation of NFE2L2 expression. Overall, our results highlight the importance of NFE2L2 gene variants in modulating the response to oxidative damage among critically ill patients. Reduction-oxidation (redox) balance is particularly important in the airways because they represent the first contact with environmental oxidants. Generation of ROS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic pulmonary diseases, including ARDS [32] , and it is a common condition among critically ill patients that results in the development of multiple organ system failure [33] . In this respect, researchers in several studies have reported the presence of oxidative damage in patients with sepsis [34, 35] . High levels of protein oxidation have been found, both in plasma and in bronchoalveolar fluids, in early stages of severe sepsis development and during major trauma [36] . NFE2L2 constitutes a hub and a master regulator of detoxifying systems, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, that are critically involved in protecting the cells against oxidative stress [6] . Using experimental animal models where this transcription factor was disrupted allowed the identification of dependent genes that are critical in pulmonary protection and confirmed that its disruption promotes susceptibility to several prooxidant-induced lung diseases, primarily owing to decreased levels of the basal and inducible expression of several antioxidant enzymes [37] [38] [39] [40] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 601, "end": 604, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1428, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1936, "end": 1940, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2071, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2193, "end": 2197, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2201, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2373, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2594, "end": 2597, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2975, "end": 2979, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2984, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2985, "end": 2989, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2990, "end": 2994, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 965, "end": 974, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The importance of redox balance in the pathogenesis of ARDS, as well as the implication of NFE2L2 in disease susceptibility or outcome, is supported by the identification of variants in a few genes involved in the oxidative stress response previously associated with ARDS susceptibility or outcome [41, 42] . Marzec et al. [9] assessed the functionality of the SNP rs6721961 (referred to by those authors at position \u2212617 bp) on the promoter region by means of a reporter gene assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In the reporter gene assay, the luciferase activity for the T allele was less than half of the activity for the G allele, indicating a significant reduction of NFE2L2 gene expression. Congruently, results derived from the EMSA showed that the formation of a protein-DNA complex was significantly diminished in the presence of the T allele, suggesting a less efficient binding of the NFE2L2 transcription factor to the ARE-like sequences of its target genes. In the same study, and consistent with these results, the presence of the T allele at rs6721961 was associated with risk for ARDS susceptibility in a nested case-control association study conducted with 30 patients with trauma-induced ARDS and 60 matched at-risk control subjects. A fixed-effects meta-analysis combining these results with those derived from our study confirmed the concordance of effects at the SNP level, showing an OR for the T allele of 2.18 (95 % CI, 1.35-3.50; p = 0.0013). The same SNP was recently found to be associated with 28day mortality in a nested case-control study that included 224 patients with ARDS from a cohort of 750 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome [10] . Also, Cantu et al. [11] found a few NFE2L2 SNPs associated with primary graft dysfunction, a specific form of ARDS developed within 72 hours after lung transplantation.

As a result of this, although ancestry adjustments were not implemented, a confounder effect due to the presence of population stratification in this study would be minimal. Besides, we acknowledge some minor limitations. Functionality obtained from HaploReg v3 [27] c SNPs associated with primary graft dysfunction in Cantu et al. [11] First, although the study sample provided 80 % power to detect a minimum risk of 1.5, we recognize that this sample size is limited to detect smaller effect sizes that are expected on average for complex traits [44] . Second, we assessed only the common variation within the NFE2L2 gene, and they would contribute to an explanation of only a modest fraction of the genetic component of the syndrome. Third, the use of populationbased controls instead of at-risk controls precludes deducing whether the NFE2L2 gene is associated with ARDS or with the underlying condition (e.g., severe sepsis). However, whatever the case, the fact that our results replicated previous findings from a study using at-risk controls strongly supports that this gene is directly involved in ARDS susceptibility.
