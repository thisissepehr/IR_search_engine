The design of the study was based on earlier experience by us and others [4, [7] [8] [9] and on the assumption that cytarabine may exert a dosedependent effect as can be observed in AML [5, 6] . In addition, as previous studies evaluating more intensive chemotherapy showed relatively high rates of cytogenetic relapse, we added IFN-\u03b1 maintenance after two courses of chemotherapy to prevent relapse. While the cytogenetic response rate proved superior in the intensified arm (P=0.02), the majority of patients lost their initial cytogenetic response emphasizing that IFN-\u03b1 maintenance proved to be insufficient to preserve the initial cytogenetic response. As a result, EFS was comparable among the two treatment arms. The lack of a sustained beneficial effect of intensified cytarabine followed by IFN-\u03b1 maintenance may be explained in several ways. Cytarabine acts almost exclusively on proliferating cells. Apart from a large pool of proliferating malignant mature and more immature myeloid cells, CML is also characterized by the presence of quiescent noncycling Ph+ progenitors [11] [12] [13] [14] , which may not have been affected sufficiently by cytarabine. As earlier shown by Holyoake et al. [12] , these progenitors may have a proliferative advantage over their quiescent normal counterparts and may, hereby, be responsible for gradually resuming malignant hematopoiesis after recovery from cytarabine induced cytopenia. Interferon-alfa maintenance did not prevent the regrowth of malignant hematopoiesis in most patients with an initial cytogenetic response. In view of the relatively low rates of complete cytogenetic responses to IFN-\u03b1 [3, 15] , also IFN-\u03b1 may have been unable to eliminate malignant progenitor cells that were responsible for the recapitulation of malignant hematopoiesis in our patients. The relatively low dose of IFN-\u03b1 administered after intensified cytarabine may have contributed to that effect. However, reports in literature do not support a dose response effect for IFN-\u03b1. A metaanalysis of three prospective controlled trials comparing low-dose and high-dose IFN-\u03b1 showed no benefit for high-dose therapy [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 270, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 271, "end": 274, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 275, "end": 278, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 380, "end": 383, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 384, "end": 386, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1287, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1292, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1297, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1401, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1848, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1849, "end": 1852, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2345, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "What has been accomplished with intensive therapy so far?

No survival benefit was observed compared with a matched historical control group. Improved survival by intensive chemotherapy was suggested by Giles et al.

In patients with a major molecular response within 12 months, estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 100% compared with 95% for patients in complete cytogenetic response without a 3 log reduction of BCR-ABL and 85% for patients who did not have a complete cytogenetic remission [21] . As a result, the current goal of treatment in first chronic phase CML patients is to aim for a major molecular response [21, 22] . Resistance, however, is a major concern. Different mechanisms of resistance against imatinib have been reported, including, mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, gene amplification or overexpression of BCR-ABL, clonal evolution, overexpression of the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, and inactivation by \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Currently, combination therapies are being developed to prevent resistance or to treat patients that have acquired resistance [28] . Apart from the combination of imatinib with alternative signal transduction inhibitors, also the combination with conventional chemotherapy is being explored. With respect to the combination of imatinib and cytarabine, two groups have reported initial results. The French CML group performed a phase II trial in 30 patients [29] . A complete cytogenetic response was obtained in 70% of the patients at 12 months. We performed a phase I/II study exploring the feasibility and efficacy of escalating doses of imatinib and two different dosages of cytarabine [30] . The probability of reaching a complete cytogenetic response was 67%, a major molecular response was 51%, and a complete molecular response was 28% at 18 months of treatment. While these initial molecular results seem promising, longer follow-up is needed to evaluate whether cytarabine significantly adds to the efficacy of imatinib and may prevent resistance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 672, "end": 676, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1146, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1151, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1156, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1161, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1166, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1299, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1630, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, high-dose cytarabine based chemotherapy followed by IFN-\u03b1 maintenance was not better as compared to low-dose cytarabine in combination with IFN-\u03b1 in early diagnosed CML patients.
