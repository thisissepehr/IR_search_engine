Despite the substantial heterogeneity among different studies, the beta-D-glucan assay has good accuracy for distinguishing patients with proven or probable invasive fungal infections from patients without invasive fungal infection [16, 17] . The beta-D-glucan assay may be used for detecting invasive fungal infections early in the course of infection, prior to the onset of overt clinical findings.
