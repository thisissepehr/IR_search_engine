The extent to which special tailoring to the addressed subjects would be helpful in improving the effectiveness of prevention measures is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review is to assess gender-specific differences in primary prevention actions. Subject and Methods A systematic review was conducted in 2015 by searching the PubMed (Medline) and Cochrane Library databases as well as adding additional studies by crossreferencing. The search focused on studies with an analysis of gender differences in health and risk behavior concerning primary prevention. Therefore, major exclusion criteria were singlegender studies, underage (<18 years) study collectives and secondary or tertiary prevention measures. Results In total, 23 studies from 13 different countries were included in the qualitative evaluation. The studies covered 11 different subtopics of primary prevention, but were too diverse in content and type to draw many fundamental conclusions. A meta-analysis was not possible. Generally a tendency for females to be more health-conscious and engaged in preventive behavior could be seen in most subgroups. Conclusion The importance of gender-specific prevention measures for the healthcare system is being increasingly stressed, but only a few studies specifically analyzing the influence of gender on preventive behavior could be identified.

The three primary studies included in this review also found that more females were observed washing their hands in public restrooms, that female healthcare workers generally washed their hands more often than males (although differences existed among professions) and that the female sex had an independent impact on health-care workers' reported intentions to perform well in hand hygiene (Johnson et al. 2003; Sax et al. 2007; van de Mortel et al. 2001) . Furthermore, males were less likely than females to show a high self-reported rate of hand hygiene (Sax et al. 2007) . Reviews and studies addressing gender differences in sexual behavior focus on condom use, number of sexual partners and communication about sex/sexual history. However this primary prevention subgroup should be viewed as a special case because sexual behavior is widely influenced by countryspecific backgrounds, risk collectives and socially desirable behavior. The primary studies identified with data collection after the year 2000 all addressed specific subgroups such as young people with disability in Africa, Latinos living in the US and US college students (Alemu and Fantahun 2011; Fernandez-Esquer et al. 2004; Jones and Cook 2008) . The existing reviews showed that it is more common for males to report multiple sexual partners and having sexual intercourse soon after meeting a new partner (Wellings et al. 2006; Wilkins et al. 2008) . Males tend to be more likely to use condoms, although in parts this was restricted to penetrative sex in contrast to other sexual activities (National Center for Health Statistics 2012; Wellings et al. 2006; Wilkins et al. 2008 ). This also held true for the primary studies regarding sexual partners, with more males reporting more partners (Alemu and Fantahun 2011; Fernandez-Esquer et al. 2004; Jones and Cook 2008) . In contrast, condom use also yielded differential results, with gender being a non-significant predictor of condom use in the most recent sexual encounter. Being a woman was associated with higher odds for condom use with the primary partner, whereas males tended to use condoms more often with casual sex partners (Alemu and Fantahun 2011; Fernandez-Esquer et al. 2004) .

The extent to which an evidence base exists for these recommendations is unknown, which calls for more investigation and raises questions pursued in this review.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "First and foremost, this study showed that despite the attention this issue receives, studies concerning the individual subtopics are scarce and quite diverse. Although the literature search yielded a fair amount of data with 23 original studies and 5 reviews after the year 2000, the small number of studies per specific content area makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions in any given field. Additionally, the results reflect huge content-related and qualitative differences between the studies. The number of studies concerning the same primary prevention subtopic was never higher than five or six. Other than that no more than three studies on one single topic were identified. A review or study on the utilization of primary prevention among genders as a whole could not be identified. Although it is possible that some studies on gender differences in health behavior were missed by our literature search, this rather limited data basis still surprises. Even before confining our study period to the year 2000 and later, no other trend was detectable. Some subtopics like sexual behavior and sun protection showed a better level of exploration, but most other subtopics were still scarcely investigated, and attempts to deduce an overall picture are lacking. Due to the use of crossreferencing and a search strategy that was precisely tailored to the topic question, we feel it is unlikely that any major relevant publications were neglected for consideration. This raises doubts about the reliability of the scientific background for the demanded actions. When summarizing all the subtopicspecific conclusions for the bigger picture in primary prevention, the female gender generally tends to encourage more and better preventive behavior, except for physical activity. In other subtopics males only showed more favorable behavior in some of the prompted subitems (e.g., wearing hats/clothes in the sun, sunbathing or condom use; see Table 4 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1953, "end": 1960, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "However, some universal as well as distinct limitations have to be considered when appraising the results. First of all, the cross-border comparison of results is at least questionable as even within the different European countries social and cultural differences that influence behavior may exist. Social networks, religion, the female cultural role, income, unemployment, level of education, country-specific health politics and migration immediately come to mind. These differences become even more pronounced when comparing developing or newly industrialized countries. In addition, the participation rates of males and females differ strongly in some studies and can include more than two-thirds of either gender (Fernandez-Esquer et al. 2004; Jackson and Villarroel 2012; Matthews et al. 2004; Sax et al. 2007 ). Despite control and adjustment for the differences in sex distribution, an influence cannot be totally dismissed. As a rather high number of publications was added by cross-referencing, it may be asked why they were not identified by the initial literature search. This might be the case because gender differences were not the primary focus of some of those studies but instead constituted incidental findings, causing results not to be coded in key words or MeSH terms. Also a general problem with searching the literature databases is to strike the right balance between maximizing the recall (quantity) and the precision of a search. When checking MEDLINE for the main terms such as Bprimary prevention,^Bgender differences^and a combination thereof (>2000 to >25,000 hits), this resulted in a very high quantity of retrieved articles that seemed to miss the necessary relevance and quality to proceed. Therefore, the search strategy had to be tailored to more precisely reflect the topic in question. This restriction in the number of search results may be a limitation of the study, but 56 identified publications, before confining the study period for the sake of topicality, is a good output. However, the retrieved results still failed to show substantial and reliable conclusions on fundamental gender differences in primary prevention but focused instead on individual subtopics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 749, "text": "(Fernandez-Esquer et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 750, "end": 778, "text": "Jackson and Villarroel 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 779, "end": 800, "text": "Matthews et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 801, "end": 816, "text": "Sax et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Topic-specific limitations such as embarrassment when talking about sex or a male desire to be seen as the 'stronger sex' have to be considered as well.

A SWOT analysis is usually used for strategic planning in the military or business world but also helps to evaluate the risks and options in other areas methodically by looking at Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. One major strength lies in the systematic approach to the topic. To our knowledge, no study exists that has specifically examined gender differences in regard to primary prevention behavior as a whole. Therefore, we tried to bring together the evidence accumulated so far to shed light upon a scientific basis that could serve as the foundation for making an informed decision. Additionally, internationally accepted search methods were generally used for the systematic literature research. However, representing a weakness of this work, it has to be noted that we did not conduct searches on each separate subtopic but looked for a more general overview concerning gender differences in the wide field of primary prevention. By focusing on each individual topic and tailoring the search strategy to its needs, a higher study count could therefore presumably have been found and used for a more detailed evaluation. The broad research approach of this study might not be ideally suited for a systematic evaluation. Since our results do not suggest an exhaustive explored study situation, both opportunities and threats overlap. Without proven scientific data on gender differences in primary prevention, the actions implemented by healthcare systems might miss their recipients. If a preventive measure is tailored specifically to one gender but the effect to which and the reason why it could influence behavior is not understood, it might not appeal to patients or even show an adverse impact. On the other hand, it might not even be necessary to implement different preventive concepts for men and women, potentially saving healthcare systems a lot of time and money. The current situation therefore leaves potential for acquiring a better understanding of the underlying principles and requires further research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SWOT analysis"}, {"text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that tries to give an overview of gender differences concerning a variety of topics in terms of primary prevention. It transpired that overall, women are more likely than men to engage in health behaviors associated with primary prevention. Therefore, the current study situation suggests that differences between men and women do exist, but that the effect and conclusions to be drawn affecting appropriate measures to be initiated by healthcare systems and politics remain unclear. In this light further studies are needed to find more details on gender differences concerning each individual prevention topic as well as to promote a more general understanding of gender differences in primary prevention.
