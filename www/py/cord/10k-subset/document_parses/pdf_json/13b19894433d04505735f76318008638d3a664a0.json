Existing weakly binding ligands (called 'binders' herein) that interact with these epitopes can be linked to a scaffold to improve multivalent binding avidity 4-8 . However, some viruses, such as dengue (DENV), present complex geometric patterns that cannot be addressed by existing scaffolds because they are not as precise in ligand spacing or provide limited control over the scaffold shape and ligand valency 9-12 . Furthermore, previous synthetic scaffolds (polymers, dendrimers, nanofibres, nanoparticles and lipid nanoemulsions) have shown some toxicity. Designer DNA nanostructures 13-17 are able to overcome previous limitations because they can be designed into various non-toxic 18-21 and biologically stable 21-25 two-dimensional (2D) or 3D platforms to control ligand spacing, valency and spatial arrangements 14, 26, 27 . Biocompatible DNA nanostructures have exhibited blood circulation times of up to 24 h (ref. 21 ) but are eventually removed by the liver 21 and kidney 28, 29 .",

Although previous studies have shown that optimizing bivalent interactions is important in protein binding 30 , cell signalling 31 and antibody spatial tolerance using DNA nanostructures 32 , to our knowledge the importance of multivalent, 2D spatial pattern matching has not yet been explored. To this end, we have included a comparison with scaffolds of different shapes and flexibilities when targeting DENV.",

These methods are lengthy, costly and require technical laboratory training. On the therapeutic front, prevention or treatment of viral infection typically relies on neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against target epitopes on the viral surface. Production of NAbs can be triggered by vaccines or active viruses in the host. However, NAbs may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (for example, with DENV 37 ), where antibodies generate increased viral infectivity in vivo, or may not provide protection against new epidemics as a result of genetic drift (for example, antigenic drift in influenza 38 ). A customizable molecular scaffold strategy capable of incorporating sensing motifs with pathogen-specific binders and patterns may address these issues on both fronts.",

The envelope protein domain III (ED3) viral epitope on the DENV surface is organized into a complex polyhedral pattern 39 with alternating clusters of trivalent or pentavalent ED3 sites. By connecting the clusters of ED3 sites linearly, we determined that a star shape, consisting of an interior pentagon connected to five exterior triangles, would provide an optimal multivalent scaffold (Fig. 1a) . The viral diameter of DNA, when folded into nanostructures with a specific shape, is capable of spacing and arranging binding sites into a complex geometric pattern with nanometre precision. Here we demonstrate a designer DNA nanostructure that can act as a template to display multiple binding motifs with precise spatial pattern-recognition properties, and that this approach can confer exceptional sensing and potent viral inhibitory capabilities. A star-shaped DNA architecture, carrying five molecular beacon-like motifs, was constructed to display ten dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3)-targeting aptamers into a two-dimensional pattern precisely matching the spatial arrangement of ED3 clusters on the dengue (DENV) viral surface. The resulting multivalent interactions provide high DENV-binding avidity. We show that this structure is a potent viral inhibitor and that it can act as a sensor by including a fluorescent output to report binding. Our molecular-platform design strategy could be adapted to detect and combat other disease-causing pathogens by generating the requisite ligand patterns on customized DNA nanoarchitectures.

Based on this structural information, the star-shaped DNA scaffold (DNA star) was then designed to not only match the local, orthodromic distances between ED3 clusters but also mirror the global pattern of ED3 clusters aligning with the star's ten vertices (Fig. 1b) . The DNA star was constructed using the tile-based self-assembly of 21 DNA oligonucleotides (strands). Each of the ten external edges is 42 bp (base pairs) long and connected to the internal edges through four arm junctions at the inner vertices. Each of the five internal edges carries a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region that can form a hairpin (stem-loop) structure with a 7 bp stem and 6 bp loop. When the hairpin unzips into ssDNA, it can stretch each internal edge to a distance that fits the distance between adjacent trivalent clusters. These hairpins provide molecular beacon-like motifs for viral detection and offer local structural flexibility to ensure binding of viral targets under various solution conditions and temperatures 40 .",

For individual DNA nanostructure assemblies, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis is a valid and more reliable method for characterizing structural formation and yield (for example, see previous studies 41-43 ). Our non-denaturing PAGE showed a distinct, major band corresponding to each of the 2D architectures, confirming that DNA star structures were formed with high efficiency (Fig. 1c) .

The envelope protein domain III (ED3) viral epitope on the DENV surface is organized into a complex polyhedral pattern 39 with alternating clusters of trivalent or pentavalent ED3 sites. By connecting the clusters of ED3 sites linearly, we determined that a star shape, consisting of an interior pentagon connected to five exterior triangles, would provide an optimal multivalent scaffold (Fig. 1a) . The viral diameter of Designer DNA architecture offers precise and multivalent spatial pattern-recognition for viral sensing and inhibition Paul S. Kwon DNA, when folded into nanostructures with a specific shape, is capable of spacing and arranging binding sites into a complex geometric pattern with nanometre precision. Here we demonstrate a designer DNA nanostructure that can act as a template to display multiple binding motifs with precise spatial pattern-recognition properties, and that this approach can confer exceptional sensing and potent viral inhibitory capabilities. A star-shaped DNA architecture, carrying five molecular beacon-like motifs, was constructed to display ten dengue envelope protein domain III (ED3)-targeting aptamers into a two-dimensional pattern precisely matching the spatial arrangement of ED3 clusters on the dengue (DENV) viral surface. The resulting multivalent interactions provide high DENV-binding avidity. We show that this structure is a potent viral inhibitor and that it can act as a sensor by including a fluorescent output to report binding. Our molecular-platform design strategy could be adapted to detect and combat other disease-causing pathogens by generating the requisite ligand patterns on customized DNA nanoarchitectures.",

The DNA star was constructed using the tile-based self-assembly of 21 DNA oligonucleotides (strands). Each of the ten external edges is 42 bp (base pairs) long and connected to the internal edges through four arm junctions at the inner vertices. Each of the five internal edges carries a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region that can form a hairpin (stem-loop) structure with a 7 bp stem and 6 bp loop. When the hairpin unzips into ssDNA, it can stretch each internal edge to a distance that fits the distance between adjacent trivalent clusters.

            "text": "DNA star-based DENV sensing. The DNA star was functionalized for DENV detection and inhibition by hybridizing a well-characterized, ED3-binding aptamer 44 at each of the 10 vertices of the DNA star to form a star-aptamer complex that geometrically matched and targeted ED3 clusters ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The aptamer exhibited weak binding to DENV, as determined by surface plasmon resonance ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . However, the binding strength increased as aptamers were placed onto scaffolds that increasingly matched the pattern of ED3 sites on DENV with the DNA star showing the greatest binding avidity ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). 6-FAM (fluorophore) and BHQ-1 (quencher) carrying strands were hybridized to each inner edge, flanking the hairpin to turn the DNA star-aptamer complex into a viral sensor. In the absence of DENV, FAM and BHQ-1 molecules would be brought together by canonical Watson-Crick base pairing in the stem, much like a molecular beacon 45 . However, unlike a molecular beacon, which gives a fluorescent readout of target nucleic acid hybridization events, here the hairpins are pulled apart and converted to ssDNA as a result of strong aptamer binding to ED3 sites. The potent multivalent interactions, promoted by the matched geometric aptamer-ED3 pattern, separated the FAM fluorophores from BHQ-1 quenchers to afford a fluorescent readout. The DNA star-aptamer sensor was able to directly detect DENV virions with high sensitivity, affording a limit of detection (LoD) of 1 \u00d7 10 2 p.f.u. ml \u22121 and 1 \u00d7 10 3 p.f.u. ml \u22121 , respectively, in human serum and plasma (Fig. 2c) . To exclude the possibility that the series of DENV-mixed DNA star sensing signals obtained within 1-2 min resulted from an automatic (non-target-triggered) separation of the fluorophores from quenchers, we measured fluorescent readouts over time at different temperatures. Fluorescent measurements over time showed that the FAM fluorophores remained quenched during the duration required for sensing and functioned at different temperatures ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). To examine the specificity of our sensor, we tested it against another virus available to us, the adenovirus. If the star-aptamer complex does not recognize the virus through proper binding, the complex will remain quenched (Fig. 2b) . The experimental results verified that the star-aptamer complex designed for DENV detection is not able to sense the adenovirus, even at high concentrations ( Fig. 2d ).",

Sensors and inhibitors recognizing the DENV pattern identity allow them to work effectively. When aptamers are arranged into an optimal 2D shape, they can be induced to fit the correct DENV pattern. In contrast, linear complexes, such as the bivalent-aptamer complex, initially have neither optimal shape nor optimal spacing, so they have weak affinity to ED3 sites. Moreover, for those that bind transiently, they have trouble staying on because the hairpin region also has affinity to the base pair. Without the optimal shape identity to keep these hairpin interactions from forming, sensing and inhibitory abilities suffer.",

The reduced sensitivity of RT-qPCR can result from the low amount of starting material (one genome copy per viral particle), RNA extraction process and instability of the extracted RNA. The star sensor, on the other hand, has direct access to the unprocessed viral sample. Up to two stars can specifically bind to a single viral particle, translating to a 10-fluorophore label (five per star). Additionally, the immunoglobulin-M (IgM) ELISA or IgM rapid test cannot provide early viral sensing as antibody production in the body requires several days after initial infection. So, no gold standard method for DENV detection can achieve the same sensing capacity in terms of cost, ease, sensitivity and speed (see Supplementary Fig. 6 standard with viral infection screening, secondary confirmation of infection by some of the standard methods (for example, viral isolation or nucleic acid sensing) should still be employed after the initial precautionary screening in order to make a full documentation and evaluation of an epidemic outbreak. The performance of the DNA star during in vitro DENV inhibition shows promising therapeutic potential. As is the case for various infectious diseases (for example, the malaria parasite 47 , DENV 48 , Zika 49 and influenza A 8 ), interactions with negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are required for host cell invasion. Thus, the DNA architecture not only relies on specific multivalent interactions for binding DENV but also electrostatically traps and isolates virions from the host cell plasma membrane and GAGs via the negative charges of the scaffold. Moreover, other monovalent aptamer combinations have been used as antiviral agents for human viruses 50 . Thus, our scaffold-based strategy can be used to arrange these same aptamers into arrangements that increase specific, on-target binding while reducing off-target binding based on pattern identity.",
