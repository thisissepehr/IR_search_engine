A cat performing toileting behaviour and not urine spraying is showing litter tray avoidance. This cat may be unhappy with its current litter tray or toileting arrangements. Whilst this may be a cause of anxiety, the litter tray situation should be a priority to question. Urine marking, characterised by the deposition of small amounts of urine on vertical surfaces, is one of the most common feline behaviour problems 1 . There are two types: sexual and reactional (anxiety-related). Sexual marking is associated with sexual excitement in male cats or the onset of oestrus in female cats. Anxiety-related marking is associated with a stressful event, a change in the cat's environment or an ongoing stressful situation, such as felines sharing space in multi-cat households 2 .",

A Feliway diffuser should then be plugged into the room where the marking has taken place and switched on for at least 4 weeks (if the cat marks several rooms, it may be necessary to use the spray as well). As additional support to the diffuser, Feliway spray can also be used. After cleaning, Feliway spray should be applied daily to both the urine marked sites and prominent objects. Treatment should be continued for at least one month and stopped when the cat marks the area with its own facial pheromone.",

At the end of the trial, it was shown that: Feliway reduced the total number of urine marks per week throughout the trial, with a significant reduction in the first week. Complete elimination of urine marking occurred in 33% of the participating households after four weeks 2 . So what are the main changes members will notice to Vet Ed?",

This provides an opportunity for DAFF to review the present policy on the role of veterinarians on-board livestock vessels.For livestock export, the prescribing veterinarian will provide instructions and support to the stockman, much in the way that they do for pastoral properties under their care. Veterinary directions and the authority to prescribe are provided by state and territory legislation and the Commonwealth may refer any matters for investigation where appropriate. In relation to the 2011 Brunei voyage, drugs administration during the voyage was not referred for investigation as there was no evidence that the prescribing veterinarian failed to comply with state legislative requirements. In addition, the stockman treated the animals in accordance with the Stockman's Handbook: Transport of Cattle by Sea, although DAFF's investigation report does acknowledge that record keeping could have been improved.For all live export consignments, the animals are examined by a DAFF Biosecurity (formerly AQIS) accredited veterinarian shortly prior to export and are found to be fit and healthy. The veterinarian has the power to remove any animals from the export chain and investigate any mortalities. In addition, the animals are inspected on arrival by the veterinary services of our trading partners. Any suspected disease event is communicated and investigated. ",
