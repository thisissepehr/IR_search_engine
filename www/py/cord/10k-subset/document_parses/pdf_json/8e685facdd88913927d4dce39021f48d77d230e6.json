Immune-enhancing enteral formula has been proven to significantly reduce infection rate in TBI patients. One of the ingredients that can be used in immunonutrition formulas to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is pycnogenol. Objective: The objective of this work is to survey the effect of pycnogenol on the clinical, nutritional, and inflammatory status of TBI patients. Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Block randomization will be used. An intervention group will receive pycnogenol supplementation of 150 mg for 10 days and a control group will receive a placebo for the same duration. Inflammatory status (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress status (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity), at the baseline, at the 5th day, and at the end of the study (10th day) will be measured. Clinical and nutritional status will be assessed three times during the intervention. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) questionnaire for assessment of organ failure will be filled out every other day. The mortality rate will be calculated within 28 days of the start of the intervention. Weight, body mass index, and body composition will be measured. All analyses will be conducted by an initially assigned study arm in an intention-to-treat analysis.",

Immediately after brain injury, proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as well as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) are produced in large volume. These worsen the condition of trauma and delay the recovery by producing oxidative stress and matrix metalloproteinases [13, 14] . These post-traumatic inflammatory cascades cause blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, which ultimately leads to the influx of inflammatory cells from the blood to the brain [15] . Production of reactive oxygen substrates (ROS) directly or indirectly, as oxidative by-products of lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids are common following traumatic brain injury. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the major by-products of lipid peroxidation. MDA is potentially an atherogenic lipid peroxide and generated in vivo via peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids [16] .",

Clinical effects of PYC include endothelium-dependent vasodilator activity [23] and anti-thrombotic effect as shown by numerous in vitro and in vivo investigations in animals and human clinical research studies [21, 24] . PYC prevents neurotoxicity and apoptotic cell death in oxidative stress status [25, 26] . Also, PYC protects against lipid peroxidation and pro-oxidants and peroxynitrites [27, 28] . A number of animal studies have proven the protective effect of PYC following traumatic brain injury by suppressing IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels [29, 30] .

IL-1\u03b2 motivates inflammatory responses and aggregates immune cells, disrupts the BBB, and forms edema, and leads to loss of neurons [39] . The high level of IL-1\u03b2 has been detected in CSF and brain tissue within the early hours of a brain injury in humans as well as in experimental animals [39] . Administration of anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibodies decreased edema and degradation of brain tissue. A previous study reported improvement of cognitive function in rats following TBI [40] . There are similar findings for IL-6. Intervention to mitigate IL-6 in animals with mild TBI triggers normal brain function and reduces the effects of hypoxia (aggravation of inflammation of brain damage) [41] . In TBI patients, CRP levels are correlated with the duration of hospitalization in an ICU and dependence on a ventilator, and the severity of the damage [42] . Finally, we selected these inflammatory factors as outcomes of the study. ",

Therefore, any intervention of treatment in this period (the first 10 days), which leads to a reduction in the risk of mortality, has great importance. On the other hand, the duration of intervention used in clinical trials to evaluate the clinical effects of PYC supplementation has varied from several hours to several months [22, 45, 46] .
