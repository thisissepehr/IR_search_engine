Pathogenic treponemes is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete pathogen that causes syphilis in human.

Ccarateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is mediated by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact. The global distribution of syphilis is alarming and there is an increasing need of proper treatment and preventive measures. Unfortunately, effective measures are limited. Results: Here, the genome sequences of 53 T. pallidum strains isolated from different parts of the world and a diverse range of hosts were comparatively analysed using pan-genomic strategy. Phylogenomic, pan-genomic, core genomic and singleton analysis disclosed the close connection among all strains of the pathogen T. pallidum, its clonal behaviour and showed increases in the sizes of the pan-genome. Based on the genome plasticity analysis of the subsets containing the subspecies T pallidum subsp. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, we found differences in the presence/absence of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and genomic islands (GIs) on subsp.-based study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Conclusions: In summary, we identified four pathogenicity islands (PAIs), eight genomic islands (GIs) in subsp. pallidum, whereas subsp. endemicum has three PAIs and seven GIs and subsp. pertenue harbours three PAIs and eight GIs.

Primarily, the pathogenic treponemes can be classified based on the clinical symptoms of the respective disease they cause.

The infections caused by T. pallidum are characterized by periods of active clinical disease interrupted by episodes of asymptomatic latent infection and may cause life-long infections in untreated individuals [4, 5] . Treponema pallidum is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete human pathogen. Syphilis is a multistage infectious disease that can be communicated between sexual partners through active lesions or from an infected woman to her fetus during pregnancy [6, 7] . Syphilis has a worldwide distribution (e.g. Africa has a high incidence), affecting every country and continent except perhaps Antarctica [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The stages of syphilis have been divided on the basis of clinical findings that lead to treatment and follow-up. Syphilis chancres may go unnoticed primarily due to their well-documented painless nature and if they are present in those parts of the body that are difficult to visualize (e.g. cervix, throat or anus/ rectum) [13] . Furthermore, due to pleomorphic appearance and lack of physician familiarity with the expressions of syphilis, their lesions may be misdiagnosed. Secondary, syphilis may manifest itself through severe rashes that may go unobserved by the patient or may mimic an extensive condition [8] . T. pallidum is completely sensitive to penicillin treatment, despite the use of this antibiotic for seven decades in treating syphilis infections. Standard treatment of uncomplicated syphilis with parenteral Benzathine penicillin G is highly effective at all stages. Many antibiotics' resistance (e.g Macrolide and Clindamycin resistance) has been reported in several countries [6] . The ongoing high rate of syphilis worldwide, despite the availability of inexpensive and effective treatment, presents the most convincing argument for the need of developing new and potent vaccine against syphilis [14] . Despite the WHO's Initiative for the Global Elimination of Congenital Syphilis, an intensive syphilis-targeted public health control has been undertaken to reduce the incidence; however, it has not been achieved yet [14] . Specifically, the reasons for failure are multifactorial; some of the responsibility can be attributed to the difficulty in the diagnosis of syphilis and treatment, and lack of access or use of prenatal screening programs [15] . The advancement in the field of genomics and cost-effective sequencing technologies has transformed the human bacterial pathogens study and helped in the improvement of vaccine designing technologies. A new and emerging methodology to get deep insight of the genome of a species or genus is the pan-genomics approach, which was introduced by Tettelin and collaborators in 2005 working with Streptococcus agalactiae [16] . Pan-genome provides us with the complete and non-redundant collection of genes from a species or genus and is composed of three subsets (core genome, shared genome and singletons): the core genome, which is the collection of all the genes commonly shared between all the genomes used as dataset; the shared genome, which contains only the genes shared between two or more strains, which are not present in all strains of the dataset; and, the singletons, which are present only in one strain and are referred to as strainspecific genes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 492, "end": 495, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 496, "end": 498, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 747, "end": 750, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 751, "end": 753, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 894, "end": 897, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 898, "end": 901, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1535, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1919, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2141, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2364, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2589, "end": 2593, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3011, "end": 3015, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The first genome of T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (strain Nichols) was sequenced in 1998.

However, it may only be the effect of relaxation of purifying selection genes involved in increasing the range of environmental responses. Interspecies genome plasticity may result from several events, of which horizontal gene transfer is particularly important because it can cause the acquisition of blocks of genes (genomic islands, or GIs), producing evolution by quantum leaps [23] . These genes are often flanked by transposases (insertion elements), have altered G + C content and skew, suggesting their acquisition through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), intermediated by phages or recombination [22] . PAIs are important in this context because they represent a class of GIs that carry virulence genes, i.e., factors that enable or enhance the parasitic growth of an organism inside a host [24] .

For the identification of core genome (commonly shared by all strains), shared genome (genes present in two or more than two strains but not shared by all strains) and singletons (strain specific genes), we used OrthoFinder [52] . Briefly, OrthoFinder uses the .faa amino acid sequence file for each genome to perform all-vs-all BLASTp for the Orthologous analysis.

Heap's Law is an empirical law represented by the formula n = k*N \u03b3 ; it describes the number of distinct words in a document (or set of documents) as a function of the document length. In a genetic context, n is the expected number of genes for a given number of genomes, N determines the number of genomes, and the k and \u03b3 (\u03b1 = 1-\u03b3) are free parameters that are determined empirically.
