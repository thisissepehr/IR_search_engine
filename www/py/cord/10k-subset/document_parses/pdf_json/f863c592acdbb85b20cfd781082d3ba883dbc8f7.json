In-vitro studies have shown that MERS-CoV can infect and replicate in human primary intestinal epithelial cells, potentially via the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor. 8 In-vivo studies showed inflammation and epithelial degeneration in the small intestines, with subsequent development of pneumonia and brain infection. 8 These results suggest that MERS-CoV pulmonary infection was secondary to the intestinal infection.",

SARS-CoV RNA was found in the sewage water of two hospitals in Beijing treating patients with SARS. 12 When SARS-CoV was seeded into sewage water obtained from the hospitals in a separate experiment, the virus was found to remain infectious for 14 days at 4\u00b0C, but for only 2 days at 20\u00b0C. 12 SARS-CoV can survive for up to 2 weeks after drying, remaining viable for up to 5 days at temperatures of 22-25\u00b0C and 40-50% relative humidity, with a gradual decline in virus infectivity thereafter. 13 Viability of the SARS-CoV virus decreased after 24 h at 38\u00b0C and 80-90% relative humidity. 13 MERS-CoV is viable in low temperature, low humidity conditions. The virus was viable on different surfaces for 48 h at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, although viability decreased to 8 h at 30\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity conditions. 14 At present, no viability data are available for SARS-CoV-2.",
