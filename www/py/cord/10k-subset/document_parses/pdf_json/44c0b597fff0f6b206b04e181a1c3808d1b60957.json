Viral vaccination programs are coming under increased scrutiny, including the current smallpox vaccination, with concerns about the occurrence of complications in people with immunodeficiency disorders. Additionally, a new climate appears to be emerging in which the acceptance of the risks inherent to vaccines is very low, the most recently casualty of this being the rotavirus vaccine [2] . Antivirals also have an advantage because they are likely to be active against a new pandemic variant, unlike viral vaccines which are generally strain specific. Antiviral agents suffer from the problem of target specificity [3] . Viruses typically use the cells own machinery to replicate the viral genome to produce new virus particles. Unfortunately, when a specific virus target is identified, the cellular processes in uninfected cells are also compromised. Polymeric drugs offer the possibility of avoiding some of these unintended occurrences [4, 5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 558, "end": 561, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 789, "end": 792, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1117, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1120, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Polymeric drugs offer a number of possible advantages over the currently employed small molecule drugs. Polymeric drugs can act either as the drug or as a means to release the drug over a period of time. Controlled or prolonged release of the drug allows a decreased amount of the drug to be present at any one time in normally sensitive sites such as the kidneys and liver, and increases the amount of drug remaining within the target site(s). For instance, tumor-associated vasculatures are frequently hyperpermeable to plasma proteins and other macromolecules [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These leaky vasculatures and limited lymphatic drainage, typical of tumor and missing in normal tissue, result in the accumulation of macromolecules such as polymeric drugs in the interstitial space of a large variety of tumors. This effect is known as the ''enhanced permeability and retention effect'', EPR.

Tilorone is mostly used as an antiviral agent as its hydrochloride. It is the first recognized synthetic, low-molecular-weight compound that is an orally active interferon inducer, and is also reported to have anti-neoplastic and anti-inflammatory actions [44, [66] [67] [68] [69] . Tilorone hydrochloride has been shown to inhibit HSV-1 and vaccinia at concentrations of 10 lg/mL [70, 71] . The researchers noted that the adsorption of the virus was not affected by the drug, and the penetration of the deoxyribonucleic acid of the input virus into the cytoplasm and nuclei proceeded normally when tilorone hydrochloride was present. However, newly synthesized viral deoxyribonucleic acid was not detectable under these conditions and there was a remarkable decrease in the rate of viral polypeptide synthesis. Further, virus particles were not formed. They noted that the inhibition of herpes virus growth by tilorone hydrochloride was dependent on the presence of the drug in the cultures. Pretreatment of the cells with the drug did not result in resistance to herpes virus infection after the removal of the drug. The researchers tested a number of ssRNA viruses and no antiviral activity was measured. By comparison, we do see activity against a dsRNA virus, reovirus. This is not [72] . Tilorone, by inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis, can and does inhibit the replication of a number of DNA and RNA viruses. For added comparison, the results for acyclovir, a commercial antiviral often used to inhibit the herpes viruses tested, are included. Inhibition of HSV-1 by acyclovir requires a concentration level of about 0.08 lg/mL and 2 lg/mL for VZV. This compares to a concentration about 10 lg/mL for the tilorone-Pt polymers against both of these viruses. But, in comparing the MIC values for acyclovir for Reovirus ST3 ([250 lg/mL) and Vaccinia WR ([200 lg/mL) the two tilorone polymers have much lower MIC values (10-20 lg/mL for Reovirus ST3 and 8-17 lg/mL for Vaccinia WR.
