            "text": "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a host RNA control pathway that removes aberrant transcripts with long 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) due to premature termination codons (PTCs) that arise through mutation or defective splicing. To maximize coding potential, RNA viruses often contain internally located stop codons that should also be prime targets for NMD. Using an agroinfiltration-based NMD assay in Nicotiana benthamiana, we identified two segments conferring NMD-resistance in the carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome. The ribosome readthrough structure just downstream of the TCV p28 termination codon stabilized an NMD-sensitive reporter as did a frameshifting element from umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus. In addition, a 51-nt unstructured region (USR) at the beginning of the TCV 3' UTR increased NMD-resistance 3-fold when inserted into an unrelated NMDsensitive 3' UTR. Several additional carmovirus 3' UTRs also conferred varying levels of NMD resistance depending on the construct despite no sequence similarity in the analogous region. Instead, these regions displayed a marked lack of RNA structure immediately following the NMD-targeted stop codon. NMD-resistance was only slightly reduced by conversion of 19 pyrimidines in the USR to purines, but resistance was abolished when a 2-nt mutation was introduced downstream of the USR that substantially increased the secondary structure in the USR through formation of a stable hairpin. The same 2-nt mutation also enhanced the NMD susceptibility of a subgenomic RNA expressed independently of the genomic RNA. The conserved lack of RNA structure among most carmoviruses at the 5' end of their 3' UTR could serve to enhance subgenomic RNA stability, which would increase expression of the encoded capsid protein that also functions as the RNA silencing suppressor. These results demonstrate that the TCV genome has features that are inherently NMD-resistant and these strategies could be widespread among RNA viruses and NMD-resistant host mRNAs with long 3' UTRs.",

RNA transcripts bearing premature termination codons (PTCs) are PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.subject to NMD as they can lead to expression of truncated, deleterious proteins that are associated with many genetic diseases and cancer. Long 3' UTRs are known to promote NMD, but many transcripts that naturally contain long 3' UTRs are protected. The nature and possible commonality of this protection is not known aside from sequences just downstream from termination codons that bind polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1. Natural stop codons in the genomes of multicistronic RNA viruses would resemble PTCs and thus these viruses must have developed the means to combat NMD to maintain genome stability. We show that the compact, positive-sense Turnip crinkle virus evades NMD by several strategies including having an unstructured region of RNA immediately downstream of the coat protein (CP) termination codon. CP is a critical protein in the virus lifecycle since CP is required to both inhibit host antiviral RNA silencing and form virions. We provide evidence that this 51-nt unstructured sequence can protect NMDsensitive templates from NMD when placed just downstream of stop codons. Unstructured regions following stop codons were over 4-fold enriched in a set of >6000 human NMD-resistant transcripts versus bona fide UPF1 targets (NMD-sensitive), suggesting this may be a wide-spread strategy for protecting otherwise susceptible transcripts from NMD.",

            "text": "Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, host cellular RNA control pathways must be tolerated or circumvented for successful virus amplification. One such pathway is nonsensemediated decay (NMD), which normally removes aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) to prevent detrimental effects caused by the expression of truncated proteins. The mechanism of NMD has been extensively studied for PTC-containing mRNAs with exon-junction complexes (EJCs) deposited during splicing downstream of the PTC (see [1] for a review). The EJC is associated with NMD factors and is removed by the ribosomeassociated PYM protein during normal translation, but remains unaltered in PTC-containing mRNAs, which leads to NMD [2] . Key NMD factors that are conserved across nearly all eukaryotes [3] include the Up-frameshift group of proteins (UPF1-3), with UPF1 as the master regulator [4] . UPF1 contains ATPase and RNA helicase domains necessary for NMD and is regulated by a complex involving UPF2 and UPF3 [5, 6] . Activated UPF1 recruits nucleases to eliminate NMD-targeted transcripts, with key differences existing between mammalian and plant systems [7] . For example, both the SMG6 endo-and SMG7-guided exonucleolytic pathways are utilized in mammalian cells [8, 9] , whereas only SMG7-coordinated exonucleolytic cleavage is used in plants due to the absence of SMG6 homologs [10, 11] .",

For polyadenylated mRNAs with short 3' UTRs, translation termination includes an interaction between eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) and cytoplasmic poly-A binding protein (PABPC1), which restricts UPF1 binding. Long 3' UTRs limit eRF3-PABPC1 interactions, allowing elevated levels of UPF1 to associate with the termination complex and increasing the likelihood of UPF1 initiating the NMD pathway [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Multiple genomewide searches, however, have identified a large number of genes with exceptionally long 3' UTRs that are resistant to NMD [19] [20] [21] [22] , but few have defined mechanisms for NMD-evasion. Human polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) has been identified as an NMDantagonist by binding polypyrimidine hexamers in the vicinity of NMD-targeted termination codons, which prevents NMD by displacing UPF1 [23] . In yeast, the RNA binding protein Pub1 protects the GCN4 and YAP1 mRNAs from NMD by direct binding to AU-rich elements downstream of their respective uORFs [24] .",

            "text": "Most RNA viruses have multicistronic genomes to conserve limited encapsidation space. As a result, many viral genomic (g)RNAs, especially those associated with 3'-co-terminal subgenomic (sg)RNAs, are templates for translation of only the 5' proximal ORF leaving a long 3' UTR (e.g., >3000 nt). Since this translation strategy makes these viruses optimal targets for NMD, most have likely evolved strategies to evade degradation [25, 26] . However, only three such strategies have been elucidated. For example, similar to some resistant mRNAs, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) contains a polypyrimidine-rich cis-acting sequence immediately downstream of the gag termination codon that provides protection of an otherwise optimal target (>6700-nt 3' UTR) by recruiting PTBP1 [23, 27, 28] . In addition, the readthrough elements from Moloney murine leukemia virus and Colorado tick fever virus inhibit NMD by allowing ribosomes to continue translation past the termination codon [29, 30] . Finally, global-inhibition of NMD has been described for Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). The HTLV-1 Tax and Rex proteins inhibit NMD through binding to UPF1 [31, 32] while the HCV core protein inhibits NMD by disrupting interactions between NMD-associated proteins WIBG, Y14, and Magoh [33] . Elucidating additional NMD-evasion strategies employed by viruses, especially strategies that could be more widespread, is not only important for understanding virus fitness but also for providing insights into additional mechanisms used by NMD-resistant cellular mRNAs.",

When translation of the gRNA terminates at the end of the 5' p28 ORF, the 3' UTR is >3200 nt in length. Infrequently, ribosomes read through the p28 stop codon to translate the p88 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). p8 and p9 are translated from sgRNA1 by leaky scanning [34] and are important for virus cell-tocell movement. The p38 CP, which is predominantly expressed from sgRNA2, requires synthesis throughout the infection cycle as CP serves as both the virus's RNA silencing suppressor [35] and as the sole protein required for capsid formation (180 copies/virion). The 3' UTR of sgRNA2 (254 nt) is considered short compared to some viruses in the Tombusviridae, but average compared to 3' UTRs of host mRNAs (average 3' UTR length in Arabidopsis is 236 nt; see S1 Fig). The 3' UTRs of viruses in the Tombusviridae have significantly higher GC% content compared to host mRNAs (S1 Fig), and elevated GC% content has been associated with increased UPF1 association and NMD [36] . Together, the multicistronic organization and high-GC% content of the TCV 3' UTR should predispose TCV gRNA and sgRNAs to NMD. In support of this, an earlier study demonstrated that TCV accumulation was strongly reduced by overexpression of UPF1 compared with levels when NMD was suppressed by addition of U1D, a dominant negative version of UPF1 that is a potent inhibitor of NMD [37, 12] . The authors thus concluded that NMD is a general virus restriction pathway in plants [37] . However, TCV replicates to ribosomal RNA levels in both cell culture and in planta, suggesting that TCV must be evading NMD and thus the endogenous (i.e., UPF1-unsupplemented) NMD pathway is probably insufficient to substantially limit TCV accumulation.",

PEMV-2 has an unusually long 3' UTR and p9 are translated from sgRNA1 and CP is predominantly translated from sgRNA2. pCB-TCV was agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana alone (-), or together with UPF1 or U1D (dominant-negative UPF1 that inhibits NMD). At 72 hpi, leaf infiltration spots were collected for RNA extraction and northern blotting. gRNA levels were normalized to those of 18S rRNA and TCV-WT levels were set to 100%. Data are from three independent leaves and standard deviations are shown. (B) Genomic organization of PEMV-2. p33 and p94 replicase proteins are translated from the gRNA while p26 and p27 movement-associated proteins are translated from the sgRNA. PEMV-2 was assayed for NMD sensitivity in the same manner as TCV but was also coexpressed with the p14 silencing suppressor since PEMV-2 does not encode a suppressor protein. (C) TCV sgRNA1 and sgRNA2 were co-expressed with either UPF1 or U1D. mRNA accumulation was assayed by RT-qPCR and CP levels were determined by western blotting. RT-qPCR data are from at least 5 independent leaves and levels were normalized to those of p14. Protein levels are representative of two independent leaves. Rb (704 nt) and generates a sgRNA with overlapping ORFs that encode proteins p27 and p26 ( Fig  1B) . p27 and p26 are required for short and long-distance movement of the virus, respectively, and p26 is additionally required for virus accumulation in protoplasts [38] . TCV and PEMV-2 gRNA expression constructs with 3' end ribozymes (Rz) were introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration either alone (-), or co-expressed with either UPF1 or the NMD-inhibitor U1D, and RNA levels were determined by northern blotting 72 hours post-infiltration (hpi). As previously reported using the same assay [37] , TCV was sensitive to UPF1 overexpression and levels were strongly enhanced when NMD was inhibited by the presence of U1D (Fig 1A) . However, when compared with UPF1-unsupplemented levels (-), TCV accumulation was not enhanced by U1D, suggesting that TCV evades NMD during infection. PEMV-2 gRNA levels were also markedly increased by co-expression with U1D compared with overexpression of UPF1 ( Fig 1B) . Compared with UPF1-unsupplemented levels, PEMV-2 gRNA levels increased by 42% in the presence of U1D and sgRNA levels were substantially higher. These results suggest that PEMV-2 is more sensitive to NMD compared with TCV.",

Agroinfiltration was used to deliver transiently expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter constructs in the absence or presence of co-infiltrated U1D [12] . If added sequences cause normally susceptible transcripts to be protected from NMD, then GFP levels should not differ significantly in the presence or absence of U1D. If transcripts remain sensitive to NMD, then suppression of NMD by U1D would allow those transcripts to accumulate to higher levels.

In contrast, a GFP reporter construct with a long, 747 nt 3' UTR derived from the coding region of the bean phytohemagglutinin gene (GFP-L) was NMD-sensitive as addition of U1D increased transcript levels by 3.2-fold ( Fig  2B) .

            "text": "Translation of the gRNA mainly terminates at the p28 ORF stop codon unless ribosomes read through the stop codon to produce the p88 RdRp [41] . This infrequent recoding event ensures that only a limited amount of RdRp is synthesized, which is important for viral fitness [42, 43] . Since earlier reports revealed that ribosomal readthrough of NMD-sensitive stop codons protects transcripts from NMD (likely through displacement of UPF1 by the translocating ribosome [29, 30, 44] ), we noted that construct p28-L, which contains the TCV recoding structural element (RSE) that mediates readthrough [45] , did not provide NMD-resistance. The TCV RSE is an extended pseudoknotted hairpin that connects with the Pr hairpin at the gRNA's 3' terminus via a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction. The TCV RSE and similar structures found in the vast majority of viruses in the Tombusviridae are located just downstream of the 5' proximal ORF UAG termination codon, incorporating the guanylate as one member of the terminal base-pair of the structure [41] . In contrast, the RSE in p28-L was (A) GFP-reporter constructs used to examine whether the 250 nt downstream of p28, p88, p8, p9, and CP ORFs (color-coded triangles) confer NMD resistance. Red hexagons denote stop codons. TCV segments were inserted just downstream of the GFP ORF in construct GFP-L, which contains the CaMV 35S promoter and a 577-nt \"L\" segment derived from the bean phytohemagglutinin gene followed by the CaMV 35S terminator sequence. (B) GFP reporter constructs were agroinfiltrated with a construct expressing p14 and either without (-) or with a construct expressing U1D. Leaves naturally fluoresce red and infiltrated tissue expressing GFP fluoresce green. RNA was extracted from individual infiltrated \"spots\" and subjected to northern blot analysis using GFP-and p14-specific oligonucleotide probes. Values were normalized to p14 levels. Data are from three independent infiltrations. Standard deviation is shown. Paired two-tailed t test: \ufffd\ufffd p<0.01.",

The RSE of PEMV-2 promotes recoding through -1 ribosomal frameshifting, which also requires a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction with a 3' terminal hairpin that was included in RSE PEMV GFP-L [46] . Unlike the TCV RSE, RSE PEMV GFP-L transcripts generated sufficient frameshift product in agroinfiltrated leaves to be detected by western blotting (Fig 3C) . As with the TCV RSE, RSE PEMV GFP-L transcripts, but not STOP-RSE PEMV GFP-L transcripts, were protected against NMD (Fig 3B, bottom) .

To determine which portion of the TCV 3' UTR was responsible for protecting GFP-L against NMD in construct 3'UTR-L, deletions were constructed within the 3' UTR sequence in 3'UTR-L (Fig 4B, top) . Deletion of the 3' terminal 91 nt (\u0394H5/Pr-L) did not affect NMD-resistance, whereas deletion of the 51-nt USR (\u0394USR-L) abolished protection against NMD (Fig 4B, bottom) . When the complete 3' UTR was positioned 578 nt downstream of the GFP stop codon (and just upstream of the 35S terminator sequence) in construct GFP-L (generating L-3'UTR), transcripts were no longer protected against NMD. These results suggest that the region at the beginning of the TCV 3' UTR provides NMD-resistance when located just downstream of a stop codon. When the PEMV-2 3' UTR was placed downstream of the GFP ORF (construct GFP-3'UTR PEMV ), transcripts accumulated 5.7-fold higher in the presence of U1D (Fig 4C) , suggesting that PEMV-2 does not contain a comparable protective region at the 5' end of its 3' UTR. To determine if the TCV USR alone can provide NMD-resistance, the 51-nt TCV USR was substituted for the first 51-nt of the PEMV-2 3' UTR in the reporter construct generating GFP-3'UTR PEMV -USR (Fig 4C) . The presence of the 51-nt USR stabilized transcripts by 3-fold, but did not confer complete protection as transcript levels in the presence of U1D were still 1.9-fold higher than in the absence of U1D (Fig 4C) . These results indicate that the TCV 51-nt USR alone is capable of providing partial NMD-resistance when placed immediately downstream of an NMD-targeted stop codon.",

Only the Saguaro cactus virus 3' UTR (GFP-SCV) was targeted by NMD, with over 2-fold greater accumulation of RNA transcripts with U1D treatment (Fig 5A, bottom) . When carmovirus 3' UTRs were inserted into GFP-L to determine if NMD-resistance persisted in the presence of a longer 3' UTR, only TCV and CCFV 3' UTRs maintained their ability to confer NMD resistance ( Fig 5B) . These data suggest that the CarMV and CbMV 3' UTRs are NMD-resistant when the 3' UTR length is short and less susceptible to UPF1 targeting. None of the carmoviruses tested, including CCFV, had more than a few sequential residues in common with TCV in the region just downstream of their CP stop codons (S2A Fig) .

Since the TCV USR is pyrimidine-rich (Fig 4A, in blue) , it was possible that the USR provided NMD resistance through binding to one of the three N. benthamiana PTB proteins. To explore this possibility, C/U residues within two possible USR PTB binding sites (CUUCUCAUCUU and CUCUCUCUU) were converted to G/A residues in construct GFP-TCV (3' UTR of TCV downstream of GFP ORF in GFP-S) or 3'UTR-L (3' UTR of TCV downstream of GFP ORF in GFP-L) generating GFP-TCV GA and GFP-TCV GA -L (Fig 6A, top) . Following agroinfiltration, GFP-TCV GA transcripts accumulated to similar levels as GFP-TCV transcripts, indicating that the pyrimidine-rich nature of the USR was not a factor in mediating protection against NMD in the shorter 3' UTR context (Fig 6A, bottom) . The TCV GA insert also conferred significant protection to GFP-L, reducing the previous 3. Fig 6A) . Together, these data suggest the pyrimidine stretches in the TCV USR play only a minor role, if any, in NMD-resistance.",

These two mutations were predicted to substantially decrease the MFE-75 of this structure (from -9.1 kcal/mol to -17.0 kcal/ mol) without altering the sequence of the USR. In-line probing of a 321-nt 3' terminal fragment from TCV STEM revealed data consistent with generation of this stable stem-loop ( Fig  6C) . TCV STEM accumulated to only 50% of TCV-WT in protoplasts (Fig 6D) , suggesting that formation of this hairpin is detrimental to virus fitness. Importantly, even though the USR sequence was unchanged, NMD-resistance was abolished for transcripts of 3'UTR STEM -L ( Fig  6E, bottom) . When the \"L\" sequence was removed to give 3'UTR STEM , only a 20% increase in RNA accumulation (p = 0.08) was observed with U1D expression (Fig 6E, bottom) . The modest effect of the STEM mutation could be due to the close-proximity of the poly-A tail to the stop codon in the 3'UTR STEM reporter construct. Earlier studies have demonstrated the NMDinhibitory effects of PABP binding near PTCs [13] [14] [15] .",

Using the TCV MFE as an arbitrary cutoff (-9.1 kcal/mol, S3A Fig), 22 .1% of NMD-resistant \"other genes\" contained highly flexible regions downstream of the stop codon (Fig 7A, S1 Dataset) .

Both the TCV RSE readthrough element and the similarly positioned PEMV-2 RSE frameshifting element prevented degradation of an NMD-sensitive GFP reporter (Fig 3) . Recoding has previously been shown to stabilize NMD-sensitive transcripts due to displacement of UPF1 by translocating ribosomes [30, 44] . Viruses from diverse families including members of the Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Luteoviridae, Tombusviridae, Retroviridae, Togaviridae, and Flaviviridae utilize ribosome readthrough or frameshifting to produce their replicase proteins [55] . This widespread translation strategy could serve a dual-purpose by simultaneously producing a required protein and protecting an otherwise NMD-sensitive transcript.",

The USR immediately following the CP stop codon was required for NMDresistance of a GFP construct, and NMD-resistance increased 3-fold when the USR was inserted into a heterologous NMD-sensitive 3' UTR ( Fig 4C) . No sequence-specific elements required for NMD-resistance could be identified in the TCV USR, including putative PTB binding sites that have only minor effects on NMD-resistance when mutated (Fig 6A) .

The most noticeable difference between NMD-resistant and NMD-sensitive carmovirus 3' UTRs was a conserved lack of RNA structure in the NMD-resistant sequences. When a stable hairpin was generated in the USR by introducing a downstream 2-base mutation, NMD-resistance was abolished and virus accumulation was reduced by 50% (Fig 6B-6F) . These findings support a link between limited RNA secondary structure, virus fitness, and resistance to NMD. Emerging research has demonstrated that 40S and 80S ribosomes leave footprints in the 3' UTRs of some host transcripts and 80S are capable of initiating translation [59] [60] [61] . It remains to be determined if ribosome footprints in the 3' UTR correlate with increased NMD resistance. However, we speculate that the association of either ribosomes and/or initiation factors with the 3' UTR can suppress NMD by occluding UPF1 from the region immediately downstream of the stop codon. Interestingly, plant virus 3' UTRs (including TCV and CCFV) are highly adapted to recruiting ribosomes and initiation factors to aid cap-independent translation at the 5' end of the genome [62, 63] . Furthermore, a 116-nt unstructured region upstream of the CP ORF serves as a TCV internal ribosome entry site for early CP translation from the gRNA [39] .",

NMD-sensitive transcripts also have statistically significant higher 3' UTR GC% content compared with NMD-resistant transcripts across the human transcriptome [8] .

The L-3'UTR construct containing the TCV 3' UTR downstream of the \"L\" sequence was generated by ligating the 3' UTR fragment into the unique XbaI restriction site immediately following the \"L\" sequence. Constructs containing carmovirus/umbravirus 3' UTRs immediately following the GFP ORF were constructed by ligating the respective 3' UTR fragments into the BamHI restriction site following the GFP ORF in pBIN61S-GFP or pBIN61S-GFPabc. GFP-TCV GA was constructed by ligating a synthetic dsDNA fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies) bearing CU-to-GA mutations into the BamHI restriction site in pBIN61S-GFP or pBIN61S-GFPabc. Synthetic dsDNA fragments were used to construct the readthrough and frameshift GFP-L binary plasmids by ligating the RSE-L-Pr fragment into the unique BsaII and XbaI restriction sites of pBIN61S-GFP. Stop codons were introduced upstream of the recoding elements by site-directed mutagenesis of sub-cloned plasmids (pUC19) and were subsequently transferred to the GFP binary plasmid by BsaI and XbaI restriction digestion and ligation. All GFP constructs contain a Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S poly(A) signal following the GFP ORF. Use of the poly(A) signal lengthens the 3' UTRs by approximately 175-nt. All constructs were sequenced and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1.",
