To gain a more complete understanding of critical care professional well-being, in line with the National Academy of Medicine recommendation to improve clinician well-being, which requires a commitment to \"measure it, develop and implement interventions, and then remeasure it\" [19] , one health system implemented an initiative wherein they serially assess critical care provider well-being [18] . At each survey, section critical care physicians complete two, complementary, validated tools to measure burnout and professional fulfillment [18] [19] [20] [21] . Notably, the initiative measures well-being when physicians are not on service in the ICU, in addition to measuring well-being when on service. As the investigators hypothesized, an ebb and flow to burnout exists, with burnout peaking at 41% when on service and subsiding to 25% when not attending in the ICU [18] . Burnout varied by rotation, implying role, staffing and ICU culture can impact burnout measures, and, as detailed below, rotation length. Furthermore, in contrast to the ebb and flow of burnout, fulfillment was common whether the physician was off service, at 60%, or during service, at 55% [18] . As context, fulfillment was observed in 34% of physicians in the validation study of the survey instrument [21] . These data suggest that fulfillment, or joy, is common in the profession of critical care medicine. Confirmatory studies engaging the entire multidisciplinary care team are warranted, as are studies designed to elucidate factors associated with professional fulfillment in the field of critical care medicine.",

This can have wide ranging effects on the individual's private life as well as patient safety. In a recent prospective, observational multicenter study of over 1500 staff from 31 ICUs in France, symptoms of depression in healthcare staff were an independent risk factor for medical errors [24] . There is also a negative relationship between individual clinician productivity and burnout. This definition of productivity included an increased number of sick days, intent to continue practicing and intent to change jobs [25] . One study from Europe also demonstrated that physicians with burnout had significantly greater odds of having self-perceived \"insufficient\" work ability [26] . This lack of confidence in one's ability may have an impact on both the practitioner's mental health and indeed ongoing patient care. ",

Burnout syndrome can also result in high sickness rates and potential skill drain in organizations if staff members feel they have no option but to leave their jobs prematurely to preserve their own mental and physical health; this may cause problems for the healthcare system, the individual, and also patient safety [28, 29] . Although an easy solution may appear to be to replace staff in these roles, this may not be a straightforward process and may be associated with a reduction in efficiency [29] . A recent estimate suggests that the average costs to replace an ICU nurse in the United States range from $36,657 to $88,000; thus higher turnover can have a significant economic impact for healthcare systems [30] . In more extreme cases, there may be no other suitably qualified candidates to perform the task, which may be a further risk to patient safety [31] .",

For example, among ICU nurses, lack of control over one's schedule and rapid patient turnover is associated with increased burnout [14] . On the other hand, having professional activities outside of bedside care, such as involvement in a work group or research team, may be protective against burnout [14, 35, 36] . Among physicians, having more night shifts, more consecutive work days, and less time since the last nonworking week contribute to burnout [17, 18] .

Numerous surveys have demonstrated an association of interpersonal conflictsbetween nurses and physicians, with peers and colleagues, with supervisors, and with patients and families-with increased risk of burnout. Interpersonal conflict in the care of critically ill patients can lead to moral distress (that is, the inability of a clinician to act according to his/her values due to internal and external constraints), which has specifically been linked to burnout [38, 39] . Even in the absence of conflicts, higher scores for quality of relationships with nurses as reported by physicians were associated with less burnout [17] , suggesting the importance of healthy and positive collaboration as a mechanism to protect clinicians.",

In general, these strategies are designed to address one or more of the \"individual-tojob mismatches\" that contribute to burnout: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values [9] . First, to prevent burnout, organizations should prioritize the creation and maintenance of healthy work environments. For example, incorporating team-building and communication training into professional development activities could improve working relationships and conflict management. Use of team debriefings after high-stress team interactions, such as cardiac arrest, can similarly promote increased and improved interpersonal communication and effective collaboration while acknowledging and applauding the team's valuable efforts. Structured communication, such as during interprofessional rounds, can support role clarity and teamwork. Collaborative decisionmaking and ethical deliberation on critical decisions can also improve the ICU environment and potential mitigate moral distress.",
