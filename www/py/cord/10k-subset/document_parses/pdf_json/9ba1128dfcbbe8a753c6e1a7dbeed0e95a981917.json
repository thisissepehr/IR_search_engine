The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301+) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (\u2264 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health and healthy communities. Across registered users' and visitors' topic areas of preference, 80.2% of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43.5% of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36.7% a moderate review quality rating. Conclusions: In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future.

The Cochrane Collaboration is an international body that produces systematic reviews of primary research at the highest standard, and as such, this is a commonly accepted definition of systematic reviews. Evidence-informed public health advocates the incorporation of the best available scientific evidence into decision making [2] . Review level evidence is an important part of evidence-informed public health decision making, since reviews synthesize the results of individual studies, providing a more accurate estimate of the effects of an intervention [3] . Rigorous synthesis of primary research minimizes bias [4] [5] [6] , explains differences among studies relating to the same research question [7, 8] , and presents more precise and consistent summary statistics than the effect sizes found in individual studies [5, [8] [9] [10] . Well-conducted reviews provide high-quality, accurate evidence [4] [5] [6] , increasing decision-makers' confidence in the strength of the review evidence and in applying the findings in practice [4] . Public health decision makers prefer using systematic reviews to assist in decision-making given that review level evidence saves time and is more efficient compared to using primary studies [6, 11] . Systematic review findings can be generalized to a larger sample, providing a great evidence base for users; such external validity is essential to ensure adaptability and applicability of evidence-based interventions into the local context [12] .

In these areas, review literature is needed to add to the existing body of literature from which decision makers can draw. In topic areas lacking in review literature, realist reviews, which provide explanatory analyses [23] , are a relatively new type of review that may provide further insight into the topic area. While these areas show the deficits in review literature, in 25 other sub-topic areas there was a wealth of systematic review literature of moderate or strong quality, including but not limited to, alcohol abuse/use, smoking cessation, women's health, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lifestyle behaviours, disease transmission, depression, diet, healthy weight, exercise, and HIV. In these areas offering many reviews, most had 15 or more which were of strong methodological quality. While review groups can identify and fill gaps in areas where evidence is lacking, there is also an opportunity to produce higher level syntheses where good-quality review evidence is available. Based on this analysis of the published, public health review literature catalogued in http://www.health-evidence.ca, all of the topic areas having many available reviews were also preferred areas of interest for users of the site. It is unclear how the availability of evidence is linked to interest in a topic, but it may be that demand can generate reviews in a particular topic area and that the public spurs research to fill gaps [24] . Alternately, preference for a topic may be a reflection of there being available evidence that drives interest in the topic and web site updates regarding that topic. Interestingly, the 15 priority topic areas indicated by a 2005 Cochrane global priority setting exercise [24] still closely match the top 10 topic areas of interest indicated by health-evidence.ca users and visitors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 935, "end": 939, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2150, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2429, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While resources such as http://www.health-evidence. ca, provide synthesized, high quality research evidence relevant to public health practice, coverage of health topics is not equal [25] . Compared to clinical review literature, there is far less population health systematic review literature [6] and within public health, a number of topic areas are without a solid base of review evidence evaluating the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., environmental health, social determinants of health) [18, 26, 27] . Public health studies are difficult to design and results are drawn from natural experiments (e.g. one health unit adopting a program compared to another health unit), thus fewer studies have been developed on the effectiveness of public health interventions compared to randomized controlled trials on medical treatments [28, 29] . However this lack of review-level evidence doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of evidence [30] . There may be primary research or other forms of evidence that can inform decisions but which may not yet have been synthesized. In cases where there are no eligible studies available to be reviewed for a particular topic, the result can be an \"empty review\", meaning that no studies were located which met the inclusion criteria to answer the question for review. Empty reviews can go unreported but may in fact be useful since empty reviews indicate interest in an area, highlight gaps, and offer a snapshot of the state of research evidence at the time of publication [31] . Even in light of a lack of evidence, or poor reporting of the evidence, decision makers can and should take an informed approach to having insufficient evidence [30] . An informed approach may be needed in topic areas that demonstrated a lack of review-level evidence, such as dental health, environmental health, food safety and inspection, and seniors' health, and particularly for public health priority areas such as healthy communities and social determinants of health. Consequently, the best literature may be sparse or of low quality in these particular topic areas. In these areas, new systematic review literature is needed to inform practice and policy decision making. It is unclear at this time whether gaps pertain only to reviews lacking in these topic areas, or whether there is a corresponding lack of primary studies as well, hindering the production of reviews. In some instances it may be necessary to first develop the primary study base in order for studies to be available for synthesis in a systematic review. Future reviews should be conducted on these broad topic areas for which review-level evidence on the effectiveness of interventions is lacking. Funding organizations should generate calls for syntheses to address these gap areas, while non-government and public health organizations should provide feedback on the lack of evidence in areas of interest to them to potential funders. Funding priorities for syntheses should reflect those areas which are priorities for public health decision makers both in Canada and internationally.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 187, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 499, "end": 503, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 504, "end": 507, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 508, "end": 511, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 938, "end": 942, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1519, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1687, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are promising indicators of demand for reviews, including actions being taken to promote the use of reviews [6, 11, 19, 30, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , an awareness of sites providing access to review-level evidence [19] and an increasing number of groups generating summaries of reviews [33] . Despite this heightened activity, given the gaps, a greater investment is needed to provide an evidence base that can meet demand and determine how to apply existing good quality systematic reviews in different contexts [25] . Organizations involved in the conduct of systematic reviews should direct synthesis funding to areas lacking in review content, or should consider higher-level reviews of reviews (where appropriate), where large bodies of review evidence already exist.

For some topic areas, many reviews are available and a higher level synthesis is needed in order to provide decision makers with greater clarity to guide policy and practice for addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, chronic diseases, mental health, nutrition, and physical activity. At the other extreme however, there are topic areas for which there are few reviews to guide practice. Specifically, social determinants of health and healthy communities were identified as areas of interest that are lacking in review evidence. In these situations, an assessment is required to determine whether primary study evidence exists to contribute to reviews, or whether the primary studies are needed so that reviews can be conducted at some point in the future. Although there are gaps in the review literature on the effectiveness of public health interventions, just under half of the reviews available on health-evidence.ca are of strong methodological quality, demonstrating that good quality review level literature on which to base many public health programs and policies exists. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will provide direction to funders of reviews and organizations involved in conducting systematic reviews as to priority topic areas for consideration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Additional file 1: Overview of the availability of reviews by topic area and methodological quality.Authors' contributions DT wrote the initial draft of the manuscript, produced the tables, and incorporated contributing author feedback into the paper.
