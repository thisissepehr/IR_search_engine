This overview outlines the four managed care programs and summarizes the results from the studies. The evaluations used administrative data and suggest a continuing challenge to structure plans so that undesired deleterious effects associated with adverse selection are minimized. Successful plans balanced risk with limited revenues so that they permitted greater access to less intensive services. Shifts from inpatient services to outpatient care were noted in most states. Future evaluations might conduct patient interviews to examine the effectiveness and quality of services for mental health and substance abuse problems more closely. to evaluate state substance abuse and mental health treatment managed care programs. A goal was to inform the development and implementation of managed care initiatives for mental health and drug and alcohol treatment services that were traditionally publicly funded. State managed care initiatives were reviewed and site visits were conducted to potential study states. Evaluation studies were completed in Arizona, Iowa, Maryland, and Nebraska.",

Programs in Arizona and Iowa coordinated funding sources (Medicaid, block grant, and state appropriations) but varied in the use of regional (Arizona) versus statewide (Iowa) managed behavioral health care organizations. Nebraska, in contrast, did not include substance abuse services as a Medicaid benefit for adults and used two distinct managed behavioral health care models to control Medicaid (a full-risk contract) and non-Medicaid funds (an administrative services only contract) for behavioral health care. Finally, Maryland required qualified health plans to assume responsibility for the delivery and management of services for abuse and dependence on alcohol and other drugs. Substance abuse treatment is managed as a subset of community mental health services in Arizona and Nebraska. Maryland and Iowa, conversely, have relatively distinct service systems and management plans for mental health versus substance abuse treatment.

The evaluation found evidence that the different rates impacted service delivery for alcohol-and drug-dependent individuals as well as those with general mental health problems and those with serious and persistent mental illness. The study used a relatively rich client-level database to explain differences in spending per client. Compared with persons with general mental health problems and persons with alcohol and drug disorders, clients with serious mental illness were the most expensive and had the longest treatment episodes. Only modest percentages of the variation in dollars spent per individual client, however, were explained using demographic information, functional scores, and selected diagnosis categories. The RBHA serving a client contributed more to explaining the spending per client than did the combination of demographics and clinical indicators. This implies that the revenues per client paid varied more across the RBHAs in relation to unobserved case-mix factors, or to factors not related to client needs, than in relation to observed client characteristics. Given that the differential capitation rates were largely established by \"experience rating\" the RBHA territories prior to implementing prospective payments, it is likely that the rates continue to reflect supply-side factors like relative capacity and practice style.",

The assessment began with legislation passed in the 1998 General Assembly that established a task force to study increasing the availability of substance abuse programs with two primary goals: (1) expand access to drug treatment and (2) increase treatment effectiveness.ll The task force examined reductions in the utilization of drug and alcohol treatment and provider concerns about slow authorization and payment for services. The task force's recommendations to improve access to alcohol and drug treatment services call for two changes.ll First, permit self-referrals, improve treatment authorization and reauthorization processes, reimburse non-network providers, make timely payments to all providers, and help drug treatment programs become network members.

This contract was amended in 1997 to provide administrative services only (ASO; eg, preauthorization, data processing, process, and pay invoices) for non-Medicaid behavioral health care.

Iowa and Nebraska were able to limit increases in Medicaid expenditures for mental health and addiction treatments. Reductions in the use of inpatient services were usually offset with increased use of outpatient and residential treatments. Thoughtfully developed managed systems of care can implement services that are effective and not harmful. Public systems of care can effectively manage the organization and delivery of services and fully benefit from the use of managed care strategies. Accountability for such public systems of care also requires improved data so that the effects of such systems can be evaluated. The studies reported here are not without limitations. They are based on four states and treatment systems at one moment in time. Medicaid policies vary substantially between states. Arizona, Iowa, and Nebraska include large rural areas and relatively isolated urban centers. Maryland is much more urbanized, and its greater population makes use of health plans more feasible. Larger, urbanized states such as New York and California may learn little from these less complex environments. Nonetheless, the evaluations illustrate the potential for administrative data to provide insight into the development and implementation of publicly funded managed behavioral health care systems. The studies also document that there is no single best approach to the introduction of managed care for publicly funded services---carefully designed and implemented initiatives can take many forms and still demonstrate cost management and maintained and improved access to care.",

As a result, financing incentives generally do not encourage health plans to serve men and women with current alcohol and drug problems (because they are more expensive to serve) and could potentially stimulate efforts to deny and restrict access to care. Similar incentives exist for any group of individuals with predictably high medical costs--adverse selection. It is in the economic interest of health plans to heighten their profitability by attracting good risks (individuals with lower health care costs) and discouraging poorer risks (higher cost individuals) from membership. 16 Because women and men with current alcohol and drug abuse tend to have higher medical costs, few plans seek to be recognized as offering excellent treatment for alcohol and drug dependence. To control adverse risks, health plans sometimes offer required benefits (ie, substance abuse treatment) but manage utilization of the services in order to control costs and reduce the attractiveness of the plan to individuals in need. The challenge for policy makers is to structure the plans they purchase to minimize undesired deleterious effects associated with adverse selection.",

The evaluation suggests that planners and policy makers need to evaluate existing system biases carefully including financial inequities prior to implementing health reform. Historical influences and discrepancies are likely to be incorporated in reforms, and \"managed care\" by itself will not be powerful enough to eliminate the influence. The Arizona data also reflected tensions around allocation of risk and resources. This is a hallmark expectation underlying managed care and capitation-confer responsibility onto organizations that can measure and internalize population-level trade-offs regarding resource allocation and system-level improvements. The success of managed care depends in large part on the willingness of providers to participate in the rationing process. The transformation has been difficult for some providers. There is persistent concern about the potential for RBHAs and providers to allocate or ration to an unacceptable degree. Opposition could reach a critical mass, and the various \"formulas\" used to manage within the limits of the capitation rates may cease to function. Policy makers and practitioners, therefore, must struggle to find and preserve an appropriate balance.",

A review 16 of risk-adjustment studies concluded that it was difficult to improve current risk classification schemes substantially and that it was unlikely that changes in risk adjusters would eliminate incentives for adverse selection. A comparison of different risk adjustment models, for example, found that none explained more than 10% of the variance in costs and failed to alter selection biases. 17 Carve-out arrangements can reduce selection biases. In behavioral health carve-outs, management of treatment for mental illness and substance abuse is separated from the rest of the health plan. Shifting behavioral health services to a specialty managed care organization consolidates the risks associated with mental health and substance abuse services. Specialty behavioral health plans also may have more experience and skill managing the mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Risk-sharing arrangements can further inhibit incentives to undertreat specific medical needs like mental health and substance abuse. 16",

Moreover, because large numbers of people are members of health plans, more individuals with alcohol and drug problems are found in health plans than in specialty substance abuse treatment programs and the criminal justice system. 18 Even if carve-out arrangements reduce adverse selection incentives and enhance the quality of treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, it is essential to continue to encourage health plans to screen, identify, and support treatment for members with substance use diagnoses. Maryland's struggle to ensure access to substance abuse treatment and to reap the benefits of integrating responsibility for primary care and addiction treatment suggests that both carve-out and carve-in strategies require well-developed state implementation strategies.",

Services were relocated from relatively expensive inpatient hospital care to lower cost, less intensive settings. The introduction of residential alternatives to inpatient hospital care and increased use of outpatient services led to substantial reductions in the use of hospital care. As a result of the shift in settings and reductions in length of stay, the cost of Medicaid claims decreased 40% in Iowa.
