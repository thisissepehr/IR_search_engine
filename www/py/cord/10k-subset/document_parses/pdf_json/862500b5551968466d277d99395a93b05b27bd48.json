Classical DF is caused by infection with any one serotype of DENV, while DHF and DSS occur in individuals with secondary infections who had prior infection with one or more DENV serotypes. In the majority of infected people, dengue is an auto-limited disease that resolves in 5-7 days. However, approximately 500,000 people develop a severe form, leading to about 20,000 deaths annually [15] . Unusual and rare Demonstration of DENV-2 in 35 of 57 cases and DENV-3 in 5 of 20 cases by reverse transcription PCR and CDC real-time PCR indicated that unusual manifestations are probably more common with DENV-2 than with DENV-3. This is in concordance with studies done by Lum et al. [16] , Le\u00e3o et al. [17] , Araujo et al. [18] , and Thomas et al. [19] . None of the patients in our study showed clinical signs of infection with other arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). This was further confirmed by reviewing the patient's past medical history, recent travel history, and vaccination record (especially yellow fever vaccination) to determine the likelihood that the current acute febrile illness was due to an infection with dengue virus. All of the 175 cases included in our study fulfilled the WHO case definition criteria for dengue. None of the patients in our study had a history of travel to regions where WNV and YFW are endemic. JEV is the only other flavivirus reported in sporadic cases in this study area. We did not observe any cross-reactivity with JEV-positive samples, which may be due to their grouping in a different serogroup. Furthermore the results of RT-PCR and CDC real-time PCR demonstrated a high degree of specificity for the dengue virus serotypes, with no cross-reaction observed with in serotypes and with serologically related flaviviruses such as JEV, WNV, and HCV. The Platelia dengue NS1 Ag assay for laboratory confirmation of dengue used in this study is highly specific [20] and revealed no positive results for YFV, WNV and JEV in our study. However, the only limitation of our study is that the types of samples used to determine specificity were limited, and more samples, especially from other flaviviral pathogens, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus and other related viruses in this group, need to be included to ensure adequate coverage of possible cross-reactions. Obtaining such sera that are negative for DENV antibody is sometimes not possible due to the high endemicity in the tropical belt.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 506, "end": 510, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 818, "end": 822, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 864, "end": 868, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2137, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the present study, 60 (34 %) out of 175 patients were without complications.
