Because of the difference in population sizes, the urban centre has standard incidence and satellite cities have mass action incidence. It is shown that the general basic reproduction number R 0 acts as a threshold between global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium and disease persistence. The case of Winnipeg (MB, Canada) and some neighbouring satellite communities is then considered numerically to complement the mathematical analysis, highlighting the importance of taking into account not only R 0 but also other measures of disease severity. It is found that the large urban centre governs most of the behaviour of the general system and control of the spread is better achieved by targeting it rather than reducing movement between the units.

Large cities are indeed often associated to smaller cities of two main types. Suburban areas are most of the time very close to the major city. They can have distinct administrative structures, but a large fraction of their inhabitants commute to the large city (or to other suburban areas) during the work week, if not every day. They also often offer some of the amenities of the large city, such as shopping centres or recreational areas, so inhabitants of the latter also visit them regularly. They are difficult to distinguish from the large city and from a modelling perspective, the large city and its suburbs can generally be considered as a single unit. The other type of structures peripheral to a large urban area are so-called satellite cities. These are generally cities in their own right, located further away from the main city than are suburban areas. However, they are connected to the main city in many ways. For instance, while they generally have hospitals, these facilities are often able to deal only with general cases, with severe cases having to be treated in the large city's facilities.

From Arino (2009) and other work on the subject, it appears that most of the time, the linear autonomous coupling of a collection of patches that are identical, save perhaps for parameter values, does not lead to behaviours that are more complex than those observed for the models in isolation. On the other hand, a change of incidence function within a single population can lead to complicated dynamics; see, e.g., Arino and McCluskey (2010) . Does the coupling of patches with different incidence functions affect the dynamics of a metapopulation disease transmission model? 2. From a more practical point of view, urban centre and satellite cities systems abound. In such configurations, what drives disease propagation in the entire system? Can satellite cities \"infect\" the urban centre, can they protect themselves from infection by the urban centre?

Here, as in the work of Arino and McCluskey (2010) , it is assumed that mass action incidence is appropriate for smaller populations, while standard (or proportional) incidence better fits larger communities. Since the communities are much smaller than the urban centre, the nature of contacts is different. In the smaller communities, it is quite conceivable that an inhabitant can meet any other inhabitant, which is well described by a mass action incidence function. On the other hand, a large urban centre has several major shopping areas, numerous neighbourhoods, etc. Many inhabitants spend their days in a small number of neighbourhoods, rarely if ever visiting others.

Interestingly, the Lyapunov function used by Li and Shuai (2009) for a system with all incidence functions of the same type can be adapted easily to the present heterogeneous case. The uniform persistence of the system as well as the existence of an endemic equilibrium were shown by setting other results by Li and Shuai (2009) in an asymptotically autonomous setting. It is suspected that when R 0 > 1, there is a unique globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium. However, here the method of proof used by Li and Shuai (2009) was not applicable because of restrictions on the movement matrices there and more work will be needed to prove this. It was finally shown that under some conditions, the general R 0 is bounded below and above by the minimum and maximum values of the individual R x 0 in the cities. The second objective of this work was to investigate a real life situation. For this, Winnipeg and its three main satellite cities were used with parameters appropriate for influenza. One possible mechanism for deriving rates of movement between cities was discussed, using estimates of the average daily number of car trips between Winnipeg and the three smaller cities that were obtained in Appendix 1. It was observed that the large city, Winnipeg, governed for the most part the behaviour of the system. Only Portage la Prairie, which has the smallest rate of movement to and from Winnipeg, was able to trigger an epidemic if all other cities (including Winnipeg) had a low value of R x 0 = 0.5. It was observed that, as far as the satellite cities are concerned, reducing the value of R W 0 was much more important than isolating from Winnipeg, since only almost perfect isolation was able to curb the overall attack rate of the disease in the case that R W 0 > 1. These numerical results provide a glimpse into the dynamics of infectious diseases in a satellite-central hub setting and highlight the major role played by the main urban centre on the course of an epidemic in such a system.
