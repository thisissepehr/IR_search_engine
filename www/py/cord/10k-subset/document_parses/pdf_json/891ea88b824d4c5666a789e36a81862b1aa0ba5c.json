Critically, HFNC as apneic oxygenation was effective in reducing the incidence of severe hypoxemia during intubation in patients with mild hypoxemia defined by a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of >200 mmHg. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ HFNC was initially utilized as an alternative breathing support for premature infants to maintain positive airway pressure [37] [38] [39] ; however, there is a propensity to use HFNC therapy in adults with respiratory distress 8, 40, 41 . In the latest meta-analysis conducted by Zhu and colleague 40 , HFNC had significantly effect on reducing post-extubation respiratory failure rate, respiratory rates, and increasing PaO 2 , comparing with conventional oxygen therapy in patients after planned extubation. In most of studies [42] [43] [44] , HFNC was compared with standard of care to demonstrate that this approach was able to improve oxygenation. Despite several potentially physiological advantages of HFNC, there is no clear evidence of efficacy for HFNC as apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation. A number of RCTs provided conflicting results regarding the efficacy of HFNC as apneic oxygenation during intubation 12, 13, [32] [33] [34] [35] . The current meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of severe hypoxemia was comparable between HFNC therapy and standard of care. between the reduction in the incidence risk ratio of severe hypoxemia and the increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. As the cut-off PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio reached approximately 250, the upper 95% CI of severe hypoxemia incidence risk ratio equaled to 1 and then the incidence of severe hypoxemia decreased. Circles indicate incidence risk ratios of severe hypoxemia in individual studies, and bubble size is proportional to the precision of individual studies.",

The trial revealed that apneic oxygenation with HFNC during endotracheal intubation increased the incidence of severe hypoxemia after adjustment for PaO 2 in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. Similarly, Simon et al. 45 uncovered that the oxygen level during bronchoscopy was significantly lower in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemia receiving oxygen via HFNC than those receiving oxygen via noninvasive ventilation. In our subgroup analysis, we found a reduction in the incidence of severe hypoxemia in patients with mild hypoxemia among those receiving HFNC (number needed to treat = 16.7). Furthermore, in the linear meta-regression interaction analysis, we observed that the trend of reduction in hypoxemia incidence followed the reduction in baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in patients receiving HFNC therapy. Therefore, we propose that optimal oxygen delivery strategy should be based on the patient; by the same token, HFNC might be beneficial for apneic oxygenation in patients with mild hypoxemia.",

Notably, the inclusion of a variety of ventilation approaches for apneic oxygenation during intubation might lead to a flawed conclusion. Contrariwise, the current meta-analysis focusing on the utility of HFNC was in agreement with previous studies by revealing that providing supplemental oxygen with HFNC during intubation might be associated with a shorter ICU stay. Previous studies [11] [12] [13] 32, 35 reported conflicting results with respect to cardiovascular complications including shock, arrhythmia, and cardiac death in association with HFNC. Our data showed that the incidence rates of peri-intubation shock and arrhythmia were lower during apneic oxygenation with HFNC, albeit without statistical significance.",

Second, the clinical heterogeneity of the included individuals was a critical confounding factor that should be considered. Third, the effect of HFNC as apneic oxygenation might not be isolated due to the different interventions of pre-oxygenation. Last, there was a paucity of large clinical trial to evaluate the true association between PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and severe hypoxemia.
