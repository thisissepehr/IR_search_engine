The management requires vigilant monitoring and highquality supportive care, including impressive use of fluids and nutritional support.

Initially some infants may show respiratory alkalosis owing to increased ventilation, but later, metabolic acidosis caused by increased respiratory muscle activity and poor fluid and caloric intake occurs.

A review of 15 published studies concluded bronchodilators to be of modest benefit in mild to moderate bronchiolitis (10) . Beneficial effects of these agents in some of the infants can be better defined if they are segregated into the wheezy and nonwheezy group, as the former is more likely to respond. Most of the younger (less than 6 mo) patients belong to the nonwheezy group and respond poorly to the bronchodilators.

Indications for intubation and ventilation commonly include hypoxia and acidosis despite oxygen therapy, respiratory exhaustion, and recurrent apnea. Although airway resistance is significantly increased and high peak pressures are often required, minimum-pressure control settings that provide adequate oxygenation should be used. Permissive hypercapnia should be preferred over aggressive ventilatory strategy to normalize carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide retention is not seen frequently except for the most exhausted infants. A generous expiratory time should be provided and rates should be kept low. Use of high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be detrimental in the older infants with wheezing. Small increase in PEEP may be supportive in younger infants without wheezing and in those with ventilatory exhaustion. Ventilatory support should be discontinued as early as possible unless there are other complications such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infants who continue to deteriorate can benefit from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).",

Two currently available preparations are Respigam (iv pooled anti-RSV IgG antibody) and Synagis (palivizumab, im monoclonal antibody [MAb] against RSV).
