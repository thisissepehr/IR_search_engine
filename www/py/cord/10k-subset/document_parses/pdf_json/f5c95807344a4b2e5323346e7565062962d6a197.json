Whether it be the Black Death in Europe in the fourteenth century or the superbug that recently spread across the globe like wildfire [1, 2] , scientists have always looked at diseases with great interest [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In the well-known theoretical SIS model, the population is divided into two disjoint classes, susceptible individuals and infected individuals, for which the percentages at time t are denoted by s(t) and i(t), respectively [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, this model is not suitable for describing diseases like flu or malaria. The subsequent Kermack-McKendrick SIR model [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] has a third class with percentages denoted by r(t). They are the recovered individuals who are immune to the infection. This is a simple model commonly used for many infectious diseases like measles, mumps and rubella. In these two models, the spread of an infectious disease in a population depends mainly on the character of the disease. The most suitable model can be chosen according to the particular case. However, these models do not work well for some special cases. For example, in the spreading of SARS, although an individual cannot develop lasting immunity, there is only a very tiny chance of being infected again.",

Each individual is treated in the same way, even at different times. A more realistic and interesting model of infectious diseases should take into account a change in the environment and the variety of characteristics of individuals [21] . Along with the spreading process, the preventive effect should become stronger because people could find useful methods such as taking pills and avoiding close contacts with infected individuals to prevent the disease from spreading [22, 23] . Moreover, how easy or difficult it is for an individual to be infected by others depends on their own characteristic, such as age, nutritional status, sex and so on. Therefore, each individual should be distinguished by different transmission coefficients and recovery coefficients. Furthermore, the part of the model that measures the coefficient of infection during the whole epidemic process should decrease as the process decreases. From this point of view, probabilistic or stochastic models are necessary for dealing with populations in which individuals have different characteristics. Our research is mainly motivated by those observations. In this paper, we study certain classes of equations which can be interpreted as stochastic models of epidemic processes.",

From Figure 1 , we can see that the traditional SIR model fits the peak value well, but not the peak width. The shorter predicted epidemic process may be because this Because of the differences between infected individuals, as expected, the epidemic process is longer and contains more fluctuations than the traditional SIR. Considering the differences among the individuals, including the preventive methods used, several susceptible persons still become infected because of their close contact with infected ones.

In Figure 4 , when the ratio is large, for example \u03b1 = 10, susceptible individuals are infected more quickly than infected ones recover. Even with a small number of susceptible individuals, infected ones change into removed ones slowly. This results in smaller saturated values for s(t) and r(t). Conversely, susceptible individuals cannot become infected ones quickly when there are a small number of infected individuals because there are not enough infected seeds. An extreme example is AIDS spreading. The recovery coefficient is near to zero (because the infected person usually dies after several or many years), so the ratio is almost infinity. If no cure is found for the infected people or no preventive method to prevent its spread to susceptible people is available, then this disease will spread across the globe even over a long time period.",
