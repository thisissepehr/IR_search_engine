During the Ebola crisis in West Africa, patients were treated with an inexpensive generic statin/angiotensin receptor blocker combination that appeared to greatly improve survival. These drugs target the host response, not the virus, and probably reverse endothelial dysfunction. Scientists and health officials have shown little interest in this idea. Yet, during the early months of the next pandemic, vaccines will be unavailable and treatment options will be limited. Physicians should be prepared to undertake clinical trials of widely available generic drugs to determine whether they improve survival in patients with seasonal influenza, other emerging virus diseases, and other forms of acute critical illness. Public health officials should give these studies their strong support. If successful, they will suggest a 'bottom up' approach to patient care that could be implemented worldwide on the first pandemic day.",

This treatment experience was unconventional, poorly documented, and ethically complicated, and it has been dismissed by international scientists and health officials. Instead, this elite group has called for complex and costly 'top down' initiatives (directed by themselves and their chosen colleagues) to develop new treatments that target these viruses. They find it difficult to accept the idea that a 'bottom up' approach to treatment that targets the host response-developed by practicing physiciansmight be effective.",

Later, in January 2015, WHO staff were told of the apparent success of treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone with the statin/ARB combination (DS Fedson, unpublished observations); again they showed little interest. One month later, one of the healthcare workers who had treated some of these patients attended an Ebola meeting at WHO headquarters. When he was asked for information about his experience, he replied \"the data will not be forthcoming\" (DS Fedson, unpublished observation).

Ebola scientists and WHO staff have never sought to directly validate the statin/ ARB treatment experience in Sierra Leone, yet, it is difficult to imagine that local physicians would have treated such a large number of patients (when they were not obligated by a clinical trial protocol to do so) if treatment were having no effect on patient survival.",

In response to this news, the Registrar of the PBSL asked local health officials and physicians several questions about how the drugs should be further studied. Two of these authors (SMO and DSF) learned of his inquiry and immediately wrote to the PBSL with suggestions on how these studies could be structured.

Since then, the laboratory and clinical evidence to support this idea has grown stronger [11, 44, [54] [55] [56] . When the next pandemic virus emerges, the world might be confronted with a social, political, and economic crisis of unimaginable dimensions.",

Clinical investigators should undertake these trials in patients with many forms of acute critical illness before the emergence of the next pandemic virus [55] . There is no guarantee that any of these trials will be successful, but if they are, the findings could be immensely important for global health, global equity, and global security. This is a lesson that physicians and public health officials in all countries must be prepared to learn.",
