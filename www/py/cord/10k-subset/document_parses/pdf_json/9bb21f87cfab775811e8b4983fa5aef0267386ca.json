Most tests to determine the need for therapeutic interven-tion are for use in foals, with fewer advances in risk assessment and intervention via the prenatal evaluation of mares. This paper examines the use of infrared (IR) spectroscopy of mare serum and pattern recognition techniques to identify subpopulations of dams at risk of producing FPT-susceptible foals. 3 Mares were classified as risk-positive or -negative based on the IgG concentrations of their foal. IR spectroscopy was able to predict the risk status 81% of the mares, with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity 80.0%.",
