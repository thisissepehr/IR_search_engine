Indeed, many patients relate the start of their disease to a particularly severe bout of \"flu\" or a cold. Prospective studies have indicated that asthma attacks are associated with a viral infection in as many as 20-50% of cases [1.2] , although the symptoms may sometimes be difficult to distinguish clinically from various forms of rhinitis and hay fever. Epidemiological evidence reviewed in a previous article [y\\ confirm a close temporal association between exacerbations of asthma and intercurrent viral infections. Unlike bacteria, viruses are associated with wheezing Illnesses in populations, in individuals, and in time and are rarely cultured from the airways during asymptomatic periods. The predominant viruses causing wheezing are human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), although the causative viral agent may vary according to age. Difficulties with the diagnosis of HRV infections are likely to have contributed to a lower reported than actual incidence of this virus and it is possible that this virus plays a more important role in the induction of asthma attacks than is currently appreciated. The mechanisms whereby upper respiratory viruses might induce or contribute to attacks of asthma arc currently unknown. It is the purpose of this review to examine the evidence available and to discuss the merits of the various mechanisms so far proposed. A further article will describe some recent advances in the molecular aspects of HRV infection and KRV diagnosis and will discuss briefly some therapeutic implications for the asthmatic patient.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 427, "end": 432, "text": "[1.2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although acute viral respiratory illnesses account for up to 53% of acute conditions seen in the USA annually [4] , Correspondence: Dr P. G. Bardin the Study of the relationship between the infecting agent and pulmonary pathophysiological mechanisms is still poorly understood. Evidence has accumulated steadily that viruses may be instrumental in the origin and/or exacerbation of asthma, but investigations have been hampered both by difficulties in establishing a viral origin in patients who manifest clinically significant bronchial symptoms such as cough, wheezing or sputum production, and by difficulties in obtaining endobronchial tissue for studies of the histology and the microanatomical changes associated with viral infections. A relationship between upper airway infection and the simultaneous or subsequent development of lower airway symptoms is often observed in the clinical situation, but how this occurs and how the tower airway abnormalities are caused remain ill-defined. There are many theoretical mechanisms whereby viruses might induce or exacerbate lower airway disease. These may be conveniently divided into (1) those proposing a virus infection that involves both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and leads directly to the pathophysiological changes observed, and (ii) those proposing a virus infection confmed to the upper respiratory tracts, which by indirect or remote means results in pathophysiological changes in the lower respiratory tracts. The mechanisms operating may vary according to the type of virus causing the infection, as well as the characteristics of the host and a combination of many of the proposed mechanisms appears likely.

Influenza A infection induces diffuse inflammation of the bronchi, trachea and larynx with desquamation of ciliated epithelial cells down to a one-cell-thick basal layer [5] . This is accompanied by submucosal oedema coupled to infiltration by neutrophils and mononuclear cells with complete resolution of 809 [6] . and ciliary defects in the nasal mucosa of children with infections with influenza types A and B. parainfluenza typ)es 1. 2 and 3, adenovirus. RSV and herpes simplex virus, though not in the single case of rhinovirus infection studied [7] . Rhinoviruses appear to cause little or only patchy epithelial damage [8] . A study with human nasal cultured epithelium demonstrated a marked cytopathic effect followed by destruction ofthe cell monolayer with both adenovirus and influenza type A infections, while no cytopathic effect was observed with rhinovirus and coronavirus infections., despite active viral replication being demonstrated [9] . In addition, nasal biopsies from subjects with HRV colds show no definitive histopathological changes, although hyperaemia and exudation of seromucinous fluid is found coupled to cytological changes such as epithelial metaplasia, and is accompanied by impaired mucociliary flow rates [10] , a feature reproduced in a separate study [1 1] . Studies in organ cultures of bovine tracheal epithelium show marked changes in epithelial microstructure after bovine rhinovirus infection [12] . Desquamation of ciliated epithelial cells was evident leaving a smooth epithelial surface with relatively few remaining cihated cells. This pattern of mucosal damage was also suggested by the increase in ciliated epithelial cells found in nasal secretions after experimental HRV infection in volunteers [13] . There are several mechanisms by which virus induced epithelial damage might result in deleterious effects in asthmatic patients. Exposure of rapid-adapting sensory parasympathetic fibres could cause bronchoconstriction via increased efferent vagal activity [14] , a theory supported by Empey el al. [15] to explain increased chollnergic responses found in normal subjects after virus infection. Similarly the penetration of allergen into the epithelium would be facilitated both by epithelial stripping, and by reduced ciliary clearance, resulting in easier access of allergen to antigen presenting cells and therefore increased allergic inflammation. The epithelium is also an important source of regulatory proteins or mediators with protective roles, such as epithelium derived relaxant factor [16] or bronchodilator prostaglandins E^ and h, which may play a role in maintaining bronchial patency [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 314, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 451, "end": 454, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1097, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1388, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1437, "text": "[1 1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1583, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1893, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2157, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2195, "end": 2199, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2796, "end": 2800, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epithelial damage"}, {"text": "Neuropeptides are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma [18] , and are broken down by neutral endopeptidases found in airway epithelium.
