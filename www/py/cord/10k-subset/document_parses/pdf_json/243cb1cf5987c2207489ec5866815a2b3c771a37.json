In 1918, an influenza A virus of the H1N1 subtype emerged and caused widespread disease; subsequently, H1N1 viruses caused seasonal epidemics until 1957. In 1957 a new influenza A virus of the H2N2 subtype, sometimes referred to as the \"Asian\" influenza, emerged to cause a second pandemic, and subsequently H2N2 viruses replaced H1N1 viruses as the cause of seasonal influenza from 1957 to 1968.

There continues to be concern regarding the potential for new influenza A viruses to be transmitted to humans, with documented severe zoonotic disease caused by influenza A H5 and H7 infections.

A limitation of the study is that other potential contributors to population immunity, such as cross-reactive NA-inhibiting antibody, stalk-specific antibody, cell-mediated immunity, and heterosubtype reactive HAI or neutralizing antibody [4] [5] [6] [7] 27] , were not assessed. Furthermore, in many parts of the world (especially in developing countries), the proportion of individuals born in 1968 or later might be larger than that in Rochester and Hong Kong. The level of immunity against A(H2N2) in these populations would be lower than that estimated here and the pandemic potential of A(H2N2) in these populations would thus be higher than estimated here.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 460, "end": 468, "text": "/1/1957-", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1397, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1401, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1405, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1409, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1413, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, we find that levels of population immunity to H2 subtype viruses are not substantial enough to block epidemic spread of an H2 virus that had acquired efficient transmissibility between humans. Furthermore, the existing levels of population immunity to H2 viruses will continue to decline with new birth cohorts being added to the human population. Given that human-adapted H2N2 viruses that arose subsequent to the 1957 pandemic are present in many laboratories worldwide, these findings support the need to have preparedness for H2 viruses as a credible pandemic threat. The approach used in the case study of H2 viruses is more broadly applicable in defining the impact of population immunity to viruses to which there is some level of cross-reactive HAI antibodiesfor example, swine H1 and H3 viruses and avian H9N2 viruses [27] . Reliable methods for assessing population immunity are a key to reliable risk assessment of viruses for pandemic threat. It was the lack of such risk assessment of population immunity to the H1N2 triple reassortant swine viruses that led to these viruses not being recognized as potentially pandemic viruses prior to 2009; indeed, it was the triple reassortment swine HA that was the key protective antigen for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.
