Adherent bacterial cells were scraped onto the medium then pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with PBS then solubilized in 5mL of TS-EDTA buffer (20mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA pH 7.6) containing 1mM PMSF (protease inhibitor) and 2% (v/v) TX-114. The solution was rocked for 2 hours at 4\u00baC, followed by centrifugation at 10,000xg at 4\u00baC for 10 minutes to pellet the insoluble phase. The soluble phase was transferred to a new tube and incubated at 37\u00baC for until solution became cloudy (indicating condensation of detergent micelles), then centrifuged for 15 minutes at room temperature to separate the detergent and aqueous phases which were then aliquoted into new tubes. Appropriate amounts of TS-EDTA buffer and TX-114 detergent were added to the tubes containing the insoluble, aqueous and detergent fractions to reach a 2% TX-114 solution, and the phase partitioning was repeated twice to clean the fractions.",

Samples were alkylated using 50 mM iodoacetamide in UA buffer for 15 min in the dark at 37\u00b0C. After a 14,000 x g for 30 min spin, the samples were washed twice with 100 \u00b5L UB buffer with identical centrifugation cycles, the MWCO filters were washed with 50 \u00b5L UB buffer and protein was placed in a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. The filter was washed twice more with 50 \u00b5L aliquots of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and pooled. Endoproteinase LysC (Pierce) was added at a 1:50 enzyme:protein ratio and left to digest at 37\u00b0C for 16 hr. Samples were diluted to <1 M urea with 0.1M ammonium bicarbonate, sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) was added at a 1:50 enzyme:protein ratio and left to digest for an additional 8 hr at 37\u00b0C. Proteolysis was quenched using formic acid and the resulting peptides were desalted using C18 Peptide Desalting Spin Columns (Pierce) per manufacturer's instructions. ",
