An immediate improvement of her clinical condition in combination with strong clinical suspicion and negative cultures led to the differential diagnosis of diseases other than sepsis. Based on the results of the biopsies that were obtained by research laparotomy, our patient suffered from primary Burkitt ovarian lymphoma. Her clinical condition improved with supportive treatment and chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the dominant treatment for Burkitt's lymphoma, while surgery or radiotherapy has no place.",

OHSS is a systemic disorder attributed to the release of vasoactive agents released from the ovaries after overstimulation [6] . The pathophysiology of OHSS is characterized by increased capillary permeability leading to large fluid extravasation, accumulation in the third space, and intravascular dehydration [7] . The serious manifestations of the syndrome include thrombosis, renal and hepatic insufficiency, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which cause severe morbidity [8] . Mortality from the syndrome is fortunately rare, with only sporadic references in the literature [8] . Women should be aware that mild forms of OHSS are common and complicate 33% of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, while moderate and severe forms occur in 3-8% of cases of OHSS [6] . The majority of serious OHSS cases occur after IVF cycles, but the syndrome may also occur after any form of ovulation induction, such as clomiphene and gonadotropins [6] . The incidence of the syndrome, particularly the complex form, is higher in young women, women with polycystic ovaries, and in gestational cycles. Laboratory tests may show high hematocrit levels (> 55%), hypoproteinemia, and leukocytosis [8] . The treatment of OHSS is initially supportive until the situation resolves [9] .",

(a) The endemic form, which is present in Africa, particularly in areas with malaria, is directly related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and is found in the bones of the face and out of lymph nodes. Pathogenetically, it is attributed to the overexpression of the oncogene c-MYC [11] (a strong transcription factor that promotes proliferation) when the end portion of the chromosome 8 translocates and comes into immediate proximity with the immunoglobulin G heavy chain promoters that are based on chromosome 14. (b) The sporadic form, which is mainly localized in the ileocecal region and in the gonads (our case), is associated with a lower percentage of EBV infection and responds well to the appropriate chemotherapy.
