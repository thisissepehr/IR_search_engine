In their study, no death was reported during a 60-month follow-up among patients with ferritin levels < 500 ng/mL. Similar results were recently published by Fujiki et al. [18] . Although poor survival has been reported [1, 2] , the clinical outcome of our patient was excellent. Interestingly, her serum ferritin levels were always < 500 ng/mL.",
