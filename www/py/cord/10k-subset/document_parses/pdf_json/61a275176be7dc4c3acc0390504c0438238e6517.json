Oncological surgeries are conventionally more challenging and complex compared with most nononcological ones. Gawande et al. devised SAS in 2007 in Boston as a predictor tool for postoperative complications (J Am Coll Surg 204:201-208, 2007). A validation study was done by in another cohort of 100 patients; however, only 70% of them had pathologically confirmed malignancies (Ann Surg 240 (2): [205][206][207][208][209][210][211][212][213] 2004). We attempt to assess SAS as a tool to predict postoperative complications in a series of 100 gynecological oncological patients operated at tertiary care center. SAS score of 100 patients with gynecologic malignancies, undergoing surgery at a tertiary care center, was prospectively collected over 4 years. These patients were observed for development of any complications occurring up to 30 days postsurgery. The complication events were graded as per Clavien-Dindo classification (Indian J Gynecol Oncolog 15:49, 2017). The data obtained was statistically analyzed by chisquare test. Thirty complication events were recorded in these 100 patients over a period of 4 years. Majority of complication events were grade IIIa or less (22 out of 30); there was only one death on 8th postoperative day. Fifty percent of patients were with SAS score of 5 or less developed complications compared with just 22.9% in patients with a score of 6 or more. Lower SAS score might be associated with higher postoperative complications in patients undergoing gynecologic oncological surgeries. Thus, patients with lower scores may benefit from a triage to more intensive postoperative care.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "To establish if surgical Apgar score (SAS) can predict complications in 30-day postoperative period in patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignancies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Women with gynecological malignancies are high-risk surgical candidates, courtesy the nature and complexity of surgical procedures.

These are American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA classification) [9] , Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) [10] , and Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM) [11] , Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) [12] , and [13] . ASA classification reflects the patients' preoperative physical status only and therefore does not reflect the patients' intraoperative conditions due to unexpected complications during surgery. APACHE and POSSUM are complicated and cumbersome to calculate and thus not widely used in clinical practice for postoperative risk prediction. SOFA and qSOFA need lesser variables for calculation; however, these are utilized once patient is admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. SAS seems to be the only reliable and objective parameter to decide intensive care for a given patient. In its absence, surgeon's or anesthesiologist's clinical acumen decides which patient would require intensive care. SAS can add to this judgment and improve patient's postoperative outcome. Surgical Apgar score is easily applicable in clinical practice due to its easy and intuitive nature. The score is easy to measure using three objective intraoperative variables, EBL, lowest HR, and lowest MAP. Lower scores have been validated and found to be associated with more postoperative complications. The original study was conducted on a subset of surgical patients undergoing colectomy; these results have been thence validated across multitude of surgical specialties [3, 6] .
