Convenience sampling and the type of media used in laboratory processing are additional limitations of the study although this ought not to affect the overall results as most healthcare-associated infections are caused by facultative anaerobes that are not typically fastidious.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of ESBLproducing organisms from patients with clinical features of HAIs at the main tertiary hospital in Sierra Leone.
