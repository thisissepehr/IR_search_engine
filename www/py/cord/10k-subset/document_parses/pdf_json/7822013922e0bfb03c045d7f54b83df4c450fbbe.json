This homotypic adhesion is independent of CD13 enzymatic activity, but requires tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangement.

Flow cytometric analysis of cells isolated from the infarct regions showed a nearly 70% decrease in the numbers of CD45+ haematopoietic cells entering the CD13 KO infarct with concomitant decreases in the numbers of CD11b + Gr-1 high inflammatory monocytes, CD11b + Gr-1 low reparative monocytes, F4/80+ macrophages, CD11c+ DCs, and CD3+ T cells at 7 days post-MI ( Figure 3A) . Quantitation of immunostained tissue sections corroborated the macrophage ( Figure 3B ) and T cell ( Figure 3C ) data. To confirm the striking degree of DC infiltration, we permanently ligated hearts from WT transgenic mice harbouring the gene encoding the mCherry fluorescent protein under the control of the CD11c promoter. 31 While the remote heart is largely negative; we observed a remarkable increase in cells displaying cytoplasmic mCherry expression in the infarct border zone in agreement with our quantitative flow cytometric data ( Figure 3D ).

Similarly, analysis of stimulated myocyte contraction showed that cells from both genotypes behave similarly, suggesting that the lack of CD13 does not impair individual cardiomyocyte function ( Figure 4B , representative tracings Figure 4C ). Following MI, macrophages produce TGF-b that induces cardiac fibroblasts to differentiate to aSMA-expressing myofibroblasts, which in turn synthesize and deposit collagen to provide tensile strength to the heart tissue and form a stable scar. 2 The adverse remodelling in CD13 KO mice would also be consistent with an impaired myofibroblast response.

While induction of CD13 expression has previously been reported, 22 the specific cell-type-expressing CD13 or its functional role in the injured/healing myocardium has not been investigated. In the current study, we find that the pattern of CD13 immunostaining is consistent with its expression on both infiltrating myeloid cells and blood vessels in the infarct area and border zone. In addition, a large proportion of the CD13 expression in the injured tissue appears to belong to a remarkably abundant population of infiltrating DCs. Functional evaluation of hearts following infarction shows that CD13 plays a protective role in cardiac repair as the hearts of mice lacking CD13 show both acute and sustained functional impairment accompanied by significant decreases in inflammatory and reparative monocyte, macrophage, DC, and aSMA-positive myofibroblast populations and left ventricular dilatation, but apparently no overall effect on angiogenesis or individual cardiac myocyte function. Thus, abnormal trafficking is the likely mechanism responsible for adverse remodelling after MI in CD13 KO hearts. The multifunctional nature of this molecule and its expression on a number of cell types that are critical to the healing process suggest that CD13 may regulate multiple aspects of immune and cardiac cell function following acute MI. CD13 KO mice have normal myeloid profiles, function, and differentiation. 20 Following MI, we observe fewer total CD45+ haematopoietic cells in the infarcts of global CD13 KO mice suggesting a generalized defect in inflammatory trafficking, consistent with our characterization of CD13 as an adhesion molecule regulating the monocyte-endothelial interactions critical for inflammatory trafficking. 18 Logically, fewer infiltrating monocytes would result in fewer macrophages and DCs and concomitant reductions in the cytokines they elicit. Indeed, we see lower levels of TGF-b transcripts, which very likely is responsible for the diminished myofibroblast numbers as well. Elegant studies have demonstrated that infarct healing occurs in a biphasic manner that depends on the sequential trafficking of pro-inflammatory monocytes (Ly6c high phase I, peaking at day 3) followed by a reparative subset (Ly6c low , phase II, peaking at day 7). Importantly, these phases must occur in sequence, as eliminating phase I alone resulted in a suboptimal phase II and consequent impaired healing. CD13 expression is significantly higher in pro-inflammatory monocytes than in the reparative subset, 34 raising the intriguing possibility that CD13 regulates trafficking of Gr-1 high , but not Gr-1 low monocytes. In our study, the reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory monocytes in phase I would in turn affect the recruitment of the reparative monocytes in phase II, leading to impaired healing of the infarcted tissue and impaired function in CD13 KO hearts. In agreement with our data, studies where monocyte or macrophage populations were either depleted or functionally impaired, the response to CD13 in myocardial healing infarction phenocopies the decrease in cell numbers that we see in the CD13 KO animals and results in significant reductions in heart function. 5, 7, 8 These findings would suggest that the decrease in infiltrating inflammatory cells in CD13 KO animals could be largely responsible for the adverse remodelling in CD13 KO hearts. Paradoxically, other studies suggest the reverse; that decreased monocyte/macrophage infiltration promotes tissue repair and less adverse remodelling. 10 -12 Taken together, these contradictory findings are believed to reflect a critical balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory activities in the healing heart. Evidence suggests that optimal healing following permanent ligation depends on the precise co-ordination of the timing, phenotype, and quantity of infiltrating inflammatory cells 1, 14 in that either excessive inflammation or repression of inflammatory activity may derail repair. 14 The question whether CD13 exclusively regulates pro-inflammatory monocyte trafficking or may designate an additional subset is currently under investigation in our laboratory. In addition to monocytes and macrophages, CD13 is highly expressed in classical DC populations and is one of a panel of signature genes that are specifically up-regulated in DCs. 35 Similar to our observations, the few studies addressing cardiac DCs have described them as aligned with and interdigitated among myocytes 36 and were found to accumulate in rat 37 and human 38 hearts following acute MI. We have recently shown a novel function for CD13 in DCs where it regulates antigen uptake and presentation, 19 suggesting that in addition to trafficking, the lack of CD13 may also impact the function of DCs in the wound. Endogenous antigens released from damaged tissue are recognized by DCs via pattern recognition receptors and often trigger extreme inflammatory responses resulting in further damage. 39, 40 Alternatively, a clear role for DCs has been demonstrated in repair where global depletion of DCs exacerbated adverse remodelling post-MI, 9 in agreement with our results. In contrast, however, the DC-ablated infarcts showed substantially increased pro-inflammatory monocyte/macrophage infiltration in striking opposition to the decreased numbers found in the CD13 KO infarcts. Because DCs are present in the CD13 KO infarcted hearts, this discrepancy strongly suggests that the lack of CD13 alters the normally protective function of DCs in the wound healing process. The role of DCs in remodelling and the novel CD13-dependent mechanisms regulating their function in vivo are an exciting and unexplored field that is currently under study in our laboratory.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 242, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1595, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1919, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2706, "end": 2708, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3376, "end": 3378, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3379, "end": 3381, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3382, "end": 3383, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3712, "end": 3718, "text": "10 -12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4053, "end": 4055, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 4056, "end": 4058, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4155, "end": 4157, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4513, "end": 4515, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4654, "end": 4656, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4693, "end": 4695, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4844, "end": 4846, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 5141, "end": 5144, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 5145, "end": 5147, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5287, "end": 5288, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We have previously shown that CD13 is also expressed on activated endothelial cells where it positively regulates cdc42 activation and filopodia formation, thus controlling endothelial invasion and angiogenesis. 23, 32 Based on these findings, we would predict a decrease in angiogenesis and fewer neovessels in the infarct area and border zone of CD13 KO animals in response to myocardial ischaemia, as has been demonstrated in tumours. 41 However, we noted a surprising increase in the total number of CD31+ luminal structures in the infarct border zone of these animals and scoring vessels by size indicated that the difference in the total number could be attributed solely to an increase in very small vessels. This increase did not result in better perfusion, as the perfused area was similar in infarcts of both genotypes. A similar increase in small, immature vessels was reported in reperfusion studies, where neutralization of platelet-derived growth factor receptors significantly increased capillary density. 42 While this study did not directly address vessel perfusion or mural cell function, the phenotype was interpreted to be the result of impaired pericyte coverage leading to uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation. CD13 is also expressed on pericytes 43 and thus, could possibly contribute to their function. In vitro assessment of endothelial cell morphogenesis by capillary network formation assays confirmed our earlier inhibitor studies, demonstrating that CD13 is required for functional angiogenesis and the equivalent numbers of larger vessels in the CD13 WT and CD13 KO animals suggest that compensatory mechanisms may be triggered in the heart in vivo in an attempt to overcome the lack of CD13.
