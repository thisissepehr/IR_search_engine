The role of Dot1L against infections was highlighted by an increase of influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus replication in Dot1L-inhibited cells mediated by a decreased antiviral response. Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2) reporter assays indicate that Dot1L is involved in the control of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-I) signaling. Accordingly, Dot1L inhibition decreases the IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulation and RIG-I-mitochondria-associated viral sensor (RIG-I-MAVS) association upon viral infection. Replication of an influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1), incapable of counteracting the antiviral response, is not affected by Dot1L inhibition. Consequently, RIG-I-MAVS association and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation, are not affected by the Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infected cells. Restoration of NS1 expression in trans also reinstated Dot1L as a regulator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling in delNS1 infections. Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) expression increases in influenza virus infected cells, but Dot1L inhibition reduces both the TRIM25 expression and TRIM25 protein levels. TRIM25 overexpression reverses the defective innate response mediated by Dot1L inhibition elicited upon virus infection or by overexpression of RIG-I signaling intermediates. Thus, TRIM25 is a control point of the RIG-I recognition pathway controlled by Dot1L and may have a general role in RNA viruses recognized by the RIG-I sensor.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Cells 2020, 9, 732 2 of 20 H1N1 virus-infected cells, we observed unaltered DNA methylation and a general decrease in histone acetylation, which correlates with the cell host transcriptional inactivation that takes place during infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Unexpectedly, we observed an increase in the methylation of lysine 79 of histone 3 (H3K79) in the infected cells [5] .

Characterization of the immune response induced by different pathogens in murine alveolar macrophages infected at high MOI [40] , showed a higher induction of TRIM25 expression in delNS1 infected cells compared with PR8 infection (data not shown). TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination stimulates RIG-I tetramerization, allowing RIG-I-MAVS interaction, which triggers the induction of the innate immune response [45] [46] [47] . The influenza virus expresses the NS1 protein, a multifunctional protein capable of counteracting the antiviral response [37] . The interaction of NS1 with RIG-I has been reported [48] . In addition, NS1 interacts with TRIM25 impairing the formation of the RIG-I-MAVS complexes [35] . The C-terminal domain of NS1 appears to be involved in NS1-TRIM25 interaction as C-terminal mutants do not bind TRIM25 and do not block RIG-I ubiquitination mediated by TRIM25 [49] [50] [51] . In contrast to PR8 infection, viral replication ( Figure 4A ), the activation of IFN-\u03b2-driven expression ( Figure 4B ), RIG-I-MAVS association ( Figure 5A ), and NF-kB nuclearization ( Figure 5D ,E) are not affected by Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infection. These data agree with the described role of the NS1 protein that would interact with TRIM25, competing with the TRIM25-RIG-I association and decreasing the antiviral response ( Figure 9A ). In the infected and Dot1L-inhibited cells, decreased levels of TRIM25 occur, which would diminish RIG-I ubiquitination, RIG-I-MAVS association, RIG-I signaling, and the antiviral response and consequently increases viral replication ( Figure 9B ). As described, in cells infected with the delNS1 virus, increased antiviral response occurs, partly mediated by the absence of competitor TRIM25-RIG-I associations. In this situation, decreased levels of TRIM25 by Dot1L inhibition may generate small changes in RIG-I-MAVS interaction with slight changes in the antiviral response. Different RNA viruses have developed similar strategies focused on TRIM25 impairment to counteract the antiviral response. The V protein of the Sendai virus [52] also competes with TRIM25-RIG-I association. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus infection downregulates NLRP12 expression, a protein that also associates with TRIM25 [53] . According to the role of TRIM25 as a check point of the innate immune induction, the decreased levels produced by Dot1L downregulation stimulate influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus replication [5] and reduce the induction of type I interferon in influenza, vesicular stomatitis, and Sendai virus infected cells (Figure 1 ). In addition, TRIM25 overexpression restores the stimulation of type I IFN in Dot1L inhibited-influenza virus infected cells or in cells expressing different intermediates of the RIG-I signaling pathway (Figure 7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 405, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 683, "end": 687, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 693, "end": 697, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 821, "end": 825, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 880, "end": 884, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 978, "end": 982, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1165, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1170, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2364, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2542, "end": 2546, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2750, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 274, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1237, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1294, "text": "Figure 4B", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1332, "text": "Figure 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1372, "text": "Figure 5D", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1612, "end": 1621, "text": "Figure 9A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1869, "text": "Figure 9B", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2865, "end": 2874, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3090, "text": "(Figure 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF13"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Dot1L was found to be associated to protein complexes that contain Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) fusion genes as a consequence of MLL translocations [6, 54] . Many different partners have been described to fuse to the protein complexes containing the MLL gene. Many of them are factors involved in transcriptional regulation, such as Dot1L, which is frequently found in those complexes [54, 55] . The host-factors relevant for infection, such as TRIM25, seem to be a target for Dot1L modulation even in uninfected cells [8] . In agreement with that, an important number of the frequent treatment-emergent adverse events that may be related with infection were reported in Phase 1 clinical trials of MLL-r patients treated with pinometostat (EPZ) [56] . The ability of Dot1L to regulate IFN signaling, supports an important and general role of Dot1L in the control of pathogen infections. Changes in H3K79 methylation during infection may modulate the access of transcriptional complexes to the genes involved in the control of the antiviral response and, thus, changes in the chromatin structure need to be considered as additional host-mechanisms for the control of RNA viruses. levels of TRIM25 occur, which would diminish RIG-I ubiquitination, RIG-I-MAVS association, RIG-I signaling, and the antiviral response and consequently increases viral replication ( Figure 9B ).
