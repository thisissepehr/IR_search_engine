Here we report that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lipidationindependent roles of Atg8 in maintaining normal morphology and functions of the vacuole require its interaction with a vacuole membrane protein Hfl1 (homolog of human TMEM184 proteins). Crystal structures revealed that the Atg8-Hfl1 interaction is not mediated by the typical Atg8family-interacting motif (AIM) that forms an intermolecular b-sheet with Atg8. Instead, the Atg8binding regions in Hfl1 proteins adopt a helical conformation, thus representing a new type of AIMs (termed helical AIMs here). These results deepen our understanding of both the functional versatility of Atg8 and the mechanistic diversity of Atg8 binding.",

In autophagy, cytosolic materials to be degraded are sequestered and enclosed inside double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes. Autophagosome formation is a complicated process that requires many autophagy-related (Atg) proteins (Mizushima et al., 2011) . Among them, the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 (called LC3/GABARAP proteins in humans) plays a central role. Atg8 is conjugated to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a series of enzymatic reactions including its processing by the protease Atg4, activation by an E1-like enzyme Atg7, and covalent linking of its G116 residue to PE by the collaborative activities of an E2-like enzyme Atg3 and an E3-like complex Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 (Ichimura et al., 2000; Hanada et al., 2007) . This covalent attachment of Atg8 to lipid is termed lipidation. Lipidated Atg8 on autophagic membranes is critically important for autophagosome formation (Kirisako et al., 1999) , and also serves as a recruitment platform for selective autophagy receptors (Shintani et al., 2002) .",

The core consensus sequence of the AIM motif is the four-amino-acid sequence W/F/YxxL/I/V, in which 'x' denotes any amino acid. When bound to Atg8, this motif adopts an extended b strand conformation and forms an intermolecular parallel b-sheet with the b2 strand of Atg8. The conserved aromatic residue (W/F/Y) and hydrophobic residue (L/I/V) in the AIM motif insert into two hydrophobic pockets on Atg8, termed the 'W-site' and the 'L-site', respectively (Noda et al., 2010) . In addition to these two most conserved residues, acidic residues within or flanking the core consensus sequence also contribute to Atg8 binding by electrostatic interactions with basic residues on Atg8.",

The lipidation-independent roles that have been discovered in model yeast species are those related to the vacuole, an equivalent of the lysosome in animals. Yeast vacuoles are usually spherical or near-spherical in shape. In the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, the loss of Atg8 caused aberrant vacuole morphology, a phenotype not shared by atg7D and atg8-G116A, two mutants defective in Atg8 lipidation (Mukaiyama et al., 2004; Tamura et al., 2010) . In another model yeast species, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the loss of Atg8 was also shown to cause abnormal vacuole morphologies, including the formation of tubular-shaped vacuoles, but the lipidation-and autophagy-deficient atg8-G116A mutant did not exhibit any vacuole morphology abnormalities (Mikawa et al., 2010) . Lipidation-independent functions of Atg8 have also been reported in animals (Al-Younes et al., 2011; Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2013; Reggiori et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2014) .

This interaction promotes the localization of Atg8 at the vacuole membrane in a lipidation-independent manner. hfl1D and atg8D caused the same vacuole-related phenotypes, which are not shared by other atg mutants. We solved the crystal structures of Atg8 in complex with Atg8-interacting regions of Hfl1 proteins. The structures showed that the Atg8-Hfl1 interaction is mediated by noncanonical mechanisms-using Hfl1 sequences adopting helical conformation (termed helical AIMs here) and in the case of budding yeast, involving a previously unreported binding site on Atg8.

            "text": "To identify Atg8-binding proteins in S. pombe, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis of C-terminally YFP-FLAG-His 6 (YFH)-tagged Atg8 expressed in atg4D cells (without the Atg4 protease, Atg8-YFH cannot be processed and lipidated). Among the proteins that specifically co-purified with Atg8-YFH is a protein called Hfl1 (systematic ID SPAC30D11.06c) (Supplementary file 1). Hfl1 was found in an unpublished study to be a vacuole membrane protein whose absence resulted in abnormal vacuole morphology (the name stands for 'Has Fused Lysosomes') (Lilavivat, 2013) . It belongs to a conserved eukaryotic protein family (InterPro ID: IPR005178; PFAM ID: PF03619, formerly DUF300). Like other proteins in this family, Hfl1 is predicted to contain seven transmembrane helices followed by a C-terminal cytosolic tail ( Figure 1A and Figure 1-figure supplement 1A ). In the model yeasts S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and P. pastoris, there is one protein belonging to this family per species, whereas in other fungi and in animals, there are often two or more proteins belonging to this family per species (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B) . In humans, members of this family include three TMEM184 proteins (TMEM184A, TMEM184B, and TMEM184C) and SLC51A (also known as organic solute transporter subunit alpha or OSTa). The TMEM184 proteins are more closely related to the fungal members of this family than SLC51A is ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1B) .",

Endogenously N-terminally mYFP-tagged SpAtg8 exhibited both a cytosolic distribution and a faint but detectable vacuole membrane localization ( Figure 1E ). The vacuole membrane localization of mYFP-SpAtg8 was completely abolished in Sphfl1D cells ( Figure 1E ). Furthermore, when SpHfl1 was overexpressed from a strong nmt1 promoter, the cytosolic signal of mYFP-SpAtg8 disappeared and the vacuole membrane localization of mYFP-SpAtg8 became much more conspicuous ( Figure 1F ). In budding yeast, we could not detect endogenously tagged ScHfl1 using live cell imaging, presumably because of low abundance. Using a strong TEF1 promoter to express ScHfl1, we found that like SpHfl1, it also localized to the vacuole membrane ( Figure 1G ). Similar to the situation in fission yeast, the overexpression of ScHfl1 resulted in the relocalization of ScAtg8 from the cytosol to the vacuole membrane ( Figure 1G) . Thus, as a vacuole-membrane-localized integral membrane protein, Hfl1 binds to Atg8 and is able to recruit Atg8 to the vacuole membrane in both yeasts. Loss of Hfl1 resulted in the same vacuole defects as those caused by the loss of Atg8",

            "text": "We then investigated the possibility that Hfl1 is involved in the lipidation-independent non-autophagic functions of Atg8. In fission yeast, loss of SpAtg8 but not loss of SpAtg8 lipidation caused aberrant vacuole morphologies (Mikawa et al., 2010) . The most striking Spatg8D phenotype reported by Mikawa et al. was tubular-shaped vacuoles, which became more frequent upon treatment with the oxidative-stress-inducing agent paraquat. In our hands, tubular-shaped vacuoles were not readily observed in untreated or paraquat-treated Spatg8D cells (Figure 2A and data not shown), possibly owing to differences in experimental details. After testing a number of other stressinducing conditions, we found that treating cells with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) resulted in the formation of tubular-shaped vacuoles in Spatg8D but not wild-type cells (Figure 2A and B). DTT may perturb vacuole function either directly by affecting ion channel activities (Carpaneto et al., 1999; Palmer et al., 2001) , or indirectly by triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Kimmig et al., 2012; Guydosh et al., 2017) . This phenotype of Spatg8D was shared by Sphfl1D but not by Spatg1D, Spatg2D, Spatg3D, Spatg4D, Spatg5D, Spatg6D, Spatg7D, and Spatg8-G116A (Figure 2A The vacuole is important for metal homeostasis and mutants defective in vacuole functions often exhibit altered metal sensitivity (Ortiz et al., 1992; Ramsay and Gadd, 1997) . To further explore the vacuole-related function(s) of SpAtg8 and SpHfl1, we examined whether the loss of SpAtg8 or SpHfl1 affects metal sensitivity. Among the metal salts we tested, which include NaCl, KCl, LiCl, MgSO 4 , CaCl 2 , ZnCl 2 , CoCl 2 , and MnCl 2 , Spatg8D and Sphfl1D cells exhibited stronger sensitivity to ZnCl 2 , CoCl 2 , and MnCl 2 than the wild type ( Figure 2C and data not shown). The metal sensitivity phenotype was not shared by the lipidation-defective mutants Spatg8-G116A, Spatg3D, and Spatg7D ( Figure 2D and Figure 2-figure supplement 2) . Notably, the severity of the metal sensitivity phenotype was the same for Spatg8D and Sphfl1D, and the double mutant Spatg8D Sphfl1D did not show stronger phenotype than the two single mutants ( Figure 2C and D, and Compared to S. pombe and P. pastoris, the lipidation-independent function(s) of Atg8 in S. cerevisiae has been less well characterized. It was reported that Scatg8D but not Scatg7D was partially defective in hypo-osmotic stress-induced vacuole fusion (Tamura et al., 2010) . However, we could not detect this Scatg8D phenotype, perhaps because it is too mild. Another study reported that vacuolar microdomain formation in stationary phase required ScAtg8 but not ScAtg8 lipidation . We were able to reproduce this observation and found that vacuolar microdomains manifested as the reticular Vph1-mCherry pattern were readily observed in wild-type but not Scatg8D cells at day 1 (D1) of the stationary phase ( Figure 2E and F). This phenotype of Scatg8D was shared by Schfl1D but not by Scatg1D and Scatg7D ( Figure 2E and F), indicating that ScHfl1 and ScAtg8, but not ScAtg8 lipidation or autophagy, are important for vacuolar microdomain formation in cells cultured to D1 of the stationary phase. Given that Hfl1 physically interacts with Atg8 in both yeasts, the mutant phenotype data strongly suggest that Hfl1 is required for the lipidationindependent vacuolar functions of Atg8 in these two species.",

The N-terminal 7-transmembrane-helix region of SpHfl1, SpHfl1(1-269), when expressed from a plasmid in Sphfl1D cells, was able to localize properly to the vacuole membrane but failed to recruit SpAtg8 ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1A) , indicating that SpAtg8 recruitment requires the C-terminal cytosolic tail of SpHfl1. We then examined a series of C-terminally truncated versions of SpHfl1, and found that SpHfl1(1-410), which lacks the last 16 amino acids, retained the ability to recruit SpAtg8, whereas SpHfl1(1-385) and several shorter fragments lost the ability (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A), indicating that the region between amino acids 385 and 410 is critical for SpAtg8 recruitment. Consistent with this idea, SpHfl1D(386-409), which lacks 24 amino acids, also failed to recruit SpAtg8 ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1A ). Using the same set of plasmids to complement the vacuole morphology defect of Sphfl1D, we found that only SpHfl1(1-410) was able to complement (Figure 3figure supplement 1B), suggesting that the SpAtg8-recruitment ability of SpHfl1 is important for maintaining normal vacuole morphology.",

Furthermore, the cytosolic tail region, SpHfl1(270-426), was sufficient for co-immunoprecipitating SpAtg8 (Figure 3-figure supplement 2A). As Atg8 binding is usually mediated by short sequence segments on Atg8-binding proteins, we proceeded to test whether the 24 amino acids required for SpAtg8 co-immunoprecipitation, SpHfl1(386-409), are sufficient for SpAtg8 binding. We synthesized an SpHfl1(386-409) peptide and performed in vitro pull-down analysis. SpHfl1 (386-409) could efficiently pull down recombinant SpAtg8 but not a control protein Yng2-PHD ( ",

To understand the atomic details of the SpHfl1-SpAtg8 interaction, we solved the crystal structure of SpAtg8 complexed with SpHfl1(386-409) at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution ( Figure 3A Table S1 ). The structure of SpAtg8 is similar to other Atg8-family proteins, consisting of a ubiquitin fold and two ahelices attached at the N-terminus. The structure of SpAtg8 can be superimposed on that of ScAtg8 with an rms difference of 0.8 \u00c5 for main-chain atoms except for those of terminal tails ( , with the side chain of W/Y/F binding to the W-site and that of L/I/V to the L-site. The number of residues intervening the two hydrophobic residues is strictly two ( Figure 3E ). Strikingly, SpHfl1(386-409) neither forms an intermolecular b-sheet with b2 of Atg8 (Figure 3-figure supplement 2G, middle), nor uses two hydrophobic residues separated by two residues to engage the W-site and the L-site. Instead, SpHfl1(386-409) uses Phe388 at the coil and Tyr398 at the helix for binding to the W-site and the L-site, respectively, with as many as nine residues between them ( Figure 3E and F). In addition, a hydrophobic interaction is formed between Leu386 of SpHfl1 and a hydrophobic pocket near the W-site, some electrostatic interactions are formed between the side-chains of Asp391 and Glu395 of SpHfl1 and Lys46 and Arg28 of SpAtg8, respectively, and two hydrogen bonds are formed between the main-chain of SpHfl1 and the side-chain of SpAtg8 ( Figure 3B and F, Figure 3 -figure supplement 3A).",

Using the sequence alignment between SpHfl1 and ScHfl1 as a guide to identify the ScAtg8-binding region in ScHfl1, our GST pulldown analysis indicated that residues 368-389 of ScHfl1 correspond to a minimal region for a strong binding with ScAtg8 ( Figure 3 -figure supplement 2H). Because a complex formed by ScAtg8 and ScHfl1(368-389) did not crystallize, we resorted to a fusion between them for crystallization, a strategy widely utilized for crystallization of a complex between an Atg8-family protein and a canonical AIM (Suzuki et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015) . The crystal structure of ScHfl1(368-389)-ScAtg8 fusion protein was determined at 2.45 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 3-figure supplement 2I and Supplementary file 2- Table S1 ). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains seven copies of the fusion protein, all of which form an intermolecular ScAtg8-ScHfl1(368-389) complex in a head-to-tail manner (Figure 3-figure supplement 2J ). Among the seven copies of ScHfl1(368-389), two have a slightly different conformation from the others due to crystal packing, while the other five copies have almost the same conformation (Figure 3-figure supplement 2K and L); therefore, we use one representative structure of the ScAtg8-ScHfl1(368-389) complex from the five copies hereafter ( Figure 3C and D). ScHfl1(368-389) has an elongated conformation with a short helical conformation at the residues 374-377, and forms extensive interactions with the W-site, the L-site, a3, as well as ; a representative structure of canonical AIMs bound to Atg8), SpAtg8-SpHfl1 and ScAtg8-ScHfl1 complexes were superimposed with each other by minimizing the rms differences of main-chain atoms of Atg8. The main chains of ScAtg19, SpHfl1, and ScHfl1 are shown with stick models, and the side chains of the two hydrophobic residues that bind to the W-site and the L-site are also shown. The residues intervening the two hydrophobic residues are numbered. (F) Summary of the interactions observed between Atg8 and Hfl1. The residues forming hydrophobic interactions are colored yellow, while those forming electrostatic interactions are colored blue (basic) and red (acidic). Hfl1 residues that when mutated affect the affinity with Atg8 by ITC measurements are highlighted with bold letters.

As is the case with SpHfl1, ScHfl1 neither forms an intermolecular b-sheet with Atg8 b2 (Figure 3-figure supplement 2G, bottom) , nor uses a canonical AIM sequence for binding to the W-site and the L-site. Instead, ScHfl1(368-389) uses Trp371 at the coil and Ile375 at the short helix for binding to the W-site and the L-site, respectively, with three residues between them ( Figure 3E and F, Figure 3-figure supplement 3A) . Unexpectedly, Tyr387 of ScHfl1 binds to a hydrophobic pocket formed between a3 and b3 of ScAtg8. This pocket, which has never been reported to be a binding site for AIMs, is named 'Y-site' because it accommodates a conserved Tyr residue in Hfl1. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions are formed between the side-chains of Asp373, Asp374, and Asp384 of ScHfl1 and Arg28, Arg67, and Arg65 of ScAtg8, respectively, and as many as 12 hydrogen bonds are formed between ScHfl1 and ScAtg8 using both the main-chain and side-chain atoms (Figure 3-figure supplement 3A). Because the Atg8-binding regions in both SpHfl1 and ScHfl1 do not form an intermolecular b-sheet with Atg8 (a strictly conserved feature of canonical AIMs) and instead use a helical conformation to bind to the L-site, we named this new type of Atg8-binding sequences 'helical AIMs'.",

            "text": "To determine the binding affinity of helical AIMs to Atg8, we performed ITC analysis. SpHfl1(386-413) and ScHfl1(362-391), which encompass the Atg8-binding regions in the crystal structures, showed Kd values of 161 nM and 1.38 mM to SpAtg8 and ScAtg8, respectively ( Figure 4A . These affinities, especially that of SpHfl1, are strong compared with canonical AIMs that typically show a Kd value of 1-100 mM (Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016) . The versions used for crystallographic studies, SpHfl1(386-409) and ScHfl1(368-389), showed only a small decrease in affinity (327 nM and 2.20 mM, respectively), whereas further truncations markedly reduced the affinities, confirming that the regions of Hfl1 used for structural studies are necessary and sufficient for strong Atg8 binding ( Figure 4A and Figure 4-figure supplement 1A). Next, we designed helical AIM mutants to validate the interactions observed in the crystal. Alanine-substitution of SpHfl1 Phe388 (F388A) and Tyr398 (Y398A), which bind to the W-site and the L-site in SpAtg8, resulted in~4 fold and~1000 fold decrease in the affinity with SpAtg8, respectively ( Figure 4A ). This result suggests that binding to the L-site is much more important than that to the W-site for the SpHfl1-SpAtg8 interaction, which is in contrast to the interactions between canonical AIMs and Atg8 where the W-site binding is usually more important than the L-site binding (Noda et al., 2008) . In this regard, ScHfl1 is more similar to canonical AIMs than SpHfl1: ScHfl1 uses Trp371 and Ile375 for binding to the W-site and the L-site, respectively, and the W371A mutation showed a much more pronounced reduction in affinity with ScAtg8 (~170 fold) than the I375A mutation (~13 fold) ( Figure 4A ). Canonical AIMs often contain acidic residues between or upstream of the two hydrophobic residues. Alanine substitution of several acidic residues located between the two hydrophobic residues of Hfl1 (D391A and E395A in SpHfl1, and D373A and D374A in ScHfl1) moderately reduced the affinity with Atg8 (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B) , indicating that electrostatic interactions also contribute to the affinity to some extent. Besides the residues binding to the canonical binding surfaces of Atg8, alanine substitution of Tyr387 and Asp384 in ScHfl1, which bind to the Y-site and Arg65 of Atg8, showed~5 fold and~7 fold reduction in affinity, respectively ( Figure 4A and Figure 4-figure supplement 1B) . Interestingly, even though SpHfl1(386-409) binds to SpAtg8 almost as strongly as SpHfl1(386-413), in the context of SpHfl1(386-413), the Y411A mutation (corresponding to the Y387A mutation in ScHfl1) resulted in~24 fold decrease in the affinity with SpAtg8 ( Figure 4A ). Y409A mutation in SpHfl1(386-413) resulted in~6 fold decrease in the affinity with SpAtg8, whereas the same mutation in SpHfl1(386-409) showed almost no effect on the affinity (Figure 4-figure supplement 1C) . These observations suggest that additional interactions involving Y411 and Y409 are important for the longer SpHfl1 peptide to bind with SpAtg8 strongly, probably because of the larger entropic cost of the longer peptide (London et al., 2010) . Thus, it is likely that helical AIMs from both SpHfl1 and ScHfl1 utilize the Y-site of Atg8 for reinforcing the interaction. In sum, ITC data revealed that the L-site-binding Tyr398 is by far the most important residue in SpHfl1 for the SpHfl1-SpAtg8 interaction, while the W-site-binding Trp371 is the most important residue in ScHfl1 for the ScHfl1-ScAtg8 interaction, and that additional hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts play reinforcing roles.",

In fission yeast, the point mutations L386A, E393A, L397A, or Y411A affected neither the ability of SpHfl1 to recruit SpAtg8 to the vacuole membrane, nor the ability of SpHfl1 to complement the vacuole morphology defect of Sphfl1D ( Figure 4B-D) . F388A and E395A moderately weakened the SpAtg8-recruitment ability, but did not substantially affect the ability to complement Sphfl1D, probably because the residual recruitment of SpAtg8 is largely sufficient for fulfilling the vacuole morphology maintenance function. The point mutation that had the strongest effect in the in vitro ITC analysis, Y398A, completely abolished the SpAtg8-recruitment ability and strongly diminished the ability to complement the vacuole morphology phenotype of Sphfl1D. Furthermore, we found that SpHfl1(Y398A) lost the ability to complement the metal sensitivity phenotype of Sphfl1D ( Figure 4E ). To determine whether the phenotype caused by the Y398A mutation is mainly due to a loss of SpHfl1-SpAtg8 association, we performed a fusion rescue analysis. SpHfl1 and SpAtg8 were fused respectively to the N terminus and the C terminus of the same mCherry protein. Because the N and C termini of mCherry are at the same end of the b-barrel structure of mCherry, the spatial proximity of SpHfl1 and SpAtg8 is likely to be preserved. We found that such a fusion restored the ability of SpHfl1(Y398A) to complement Sphfl1D ( Figure 4E and the physical association between SpHfl1 and SpAtg8 is essential for the lipidation-independent vacuolar functions of SpAtg8.",

Neither fusion to the vacuolar phytochelatin transporter Hmt1 nor fusion to the vacuolar zinc transporter Zhf1 was able to rescue the vacuole morphology phenotype of Sphfl1D (Figure 4 -figure supplement 3), suggesting that SpHfl1 may have role(s) beyond recruiting SpAtg8 to the vacuole membrane.",

Surprisingly, none of these mutations individually had an obvious effect on the ability of ScHfl1 expressed from either the strong TEF1 promoter or the weak URA3 promoter to complement the microdomain formation defect of Schfl1D ( Figure 4G and H, and Figure 4-figure supplement 4) , suggesting that the residual Atg8-binding ability is sufficient for the microdomain formation function. To further reduce the ScAtg8-binding ability of ScHfl1, we combined mutations together and found that combining W371A and I375A to simultaneously disrupt the interactions at the W-site and the L-site was not able to abolish the ability of ScHfl1 to complement Schfl1D, whereas combining W371A, I375A, D384A, and Y387A together led to the complete loss of the complementing ability ( Figure 4G and H, and Figure 4-figure supplement 4) . We confirmed by ITC measurements that the double mutant (W371A I375A) retained weak affinity, but that the quadruple mutant (W371A I375A D384A Y387A) showed no binding with ScAtg8 ( Figure 4I Figure 4J) , indicating that the microdomain formation defect of this ScHfl1 mutant is indeed due to a loss of ScAtg8-binding ability.

The helical AIMs we identified in SpHfl1 and ScHfl1 do not conform to these rules: they do not form an intermolecular b-sheet with Atg8 and they do not have a W/F/YxxL/I/V motif. Instead, SpHfl1 and ScHfl1 respectively use FxxxxxxxxxY and WxxxI sequences for Atg8 binding.

One example is a non-natural synthetic peptide named K1 that binds to GABARAP with high affinity (Kd = 354 nM) (Weiergr\u00e4ber et al., 2008) . The K1 peptide contains a WxxLxW sequence, and interestingly the sequence binds to GABARAP in a reverse direction: the N-terminal WxxL portion with a helical conformation binds to the L-site using both Trp and Leu, while the C-terminal Trp in the sequence binds to the W-site. It remains to be elucidated whether such binding sequence is present in natural proteins. Another example is the coiled-coil region of the retroviral restriction factor Trim5a, which was reported very recently to bind to mammalian ATG8 proteins using the coiled-coil architecture, and thus is named helical LIR (Keown et al., 2018) . Helical LIR of Trim5a uses Trp196 to bind to the W-site, but lacks a hydrophobic residue that binds to the L-site, which may be one reason for its weak affinity with mammalian Atg8 homologs (Kd = 80~100 mM). The functional importance of helical-LIR-mediated Trim5a-Atg8 interaction remains unclear.",

In FYCO1, a helix is attached to the canonical AIM and increases the affinity by additional interactions.

However, a recent phylogenetic study has grouped TMEM184 proteins and SLC51A proteins into the transporter-opsin-GPCR (TOG) superfamily, which includes non-transporter proteins such as the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Saier et al., 2016; Yee et al., 2013) , hinting that the InterPro IPR005178 family proteins may not necessarily all be transporters.

Consistent with this idea, genome-wide deletion library screens in S. cerevisiae have shown that a substantial fraction of deletion mutants sensitive to metals are those exhibiting abnormal vacuole morphology (Pagani et al., 2007; Ruotolo et al., 2008) . Even though vacuole morphology maintenance has not been as extensively investigated in S. pombe as in S. cerevisiae, the tubular vacuole morphology phenotype of Spatg8D and Sphfl1D mutants seems quite distinctive. To our knowledge, the only other genetic perturbation that can result in tubular vacuoles in fission yeast is the overexpression of the dynamin homolog Vps1 (R\u00f6 thlisberger et al., 2009) . Furthermore, vps1D suppressed the tubular vacuole phenotype of Spatg8D (Mikawa et al., 2010) . Thus, SpAtg8 and SpHfl1 may directly or indirectly restrain the vacuole tubulation activity of Vps1.",

In Drosophila, a form of noncanonical autophagy required for programmed midgut removal is dependent on Atg8 but not Atg7 and Atg3, the E1 and E2 proteins needed for Atg8 lipidation (Chang et al., 2013) . How Atg8 is recruited to the autophagosomal membrane during this process is unknown. In mammalian cells, a non-autophagic process, the formation of ERAD tuning vesicle/EDEMosome, depends on non-lipidated LC3, but the exact mechanism is unclear (Cal\u00ec et al., 2008; Reggiori et al., 2010) . Our findings on the lipidation-independent vacuolar functions of Atg8 in yeasts suggest the possibility that interactions between Atg8 and a transmembrane protein may underlie these lipidation-independent functions of Atg8 in animals.

The deletion strains used in this study were constructed either by PCR amplifying the deletion cassettes in the Bioneer fission yeast deletion strains and transforming them into our laboratory strains, or by standard PCR-based gene targeting. Strains expressing proteins with tags (mCherry, GFP, Venus, etc.) under native promoters were generated by PCR-based tagging. The strain expressing SpAtg8 fused at the N-terminus with a CFP tag was as previous described . Plasmids expressing proteins under the control of the Pnmt1 or P41nmt1 promoter were constructed using modified pDUAL vectors (Wei et al., 2014) . To construct atg8-G116A fission yeast strain, we used overlap-extension PCR to assemble the following three fragments into one final PCR product: the C-terminal region of the atg8 ORF (amplified using the primer 5'-TTAATTAACCCGGGGATCCGctaaaaaggaaacactgttGcaaat-3', which introduces the G116A mutation, and the primer 5'-acaacacccattgtttttgtca-3'), a kanMX marker from pFA6a plasmid (amplified using primers 5'-CGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3' and 5'-CGATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTT-3'), and the sequence downstream of the atg8 ORF (amplified using primers 5'-AAACGAGCTCGAA TTCATCGatcaacaatttgcctgttttaaga-3' and 5'-aaggatagaatcagctgatgat-3'), and transformed the final PCR product into fission yeast. Plasmids expressing proteins in budding yeast under the control of the pTEF1 promoter were constructed using pNH605 vectors (plasmids cut with PmeI before transformation) (Zhang et al., 2017) . To create a fission yeast strain expressing Atg8 tagged at its N-terminus with mYFP or mEGFP, Patg8 promoter, from \u00c0609 to +3 bp with respect to the start codon of the atg8 gene, was cloned between the BglII and PacI sites of pFA6a-kanMX6-P41nmt1-mYFP or pFA6a-kanMX6-P41nmt1-mEGFP plasmid to replace the P41nmt1 promoter (B\u00e4hler et al., 1998) .",

After centrifugation, the bacteria were resuspended to PBS with 5 mM EDTA and lysed by sonication for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with affinity resin column: GST accept resin (Nacalai Tesque) for GST-fused proteins and Amylose Resin High Flow resin for MBP-fused proteins (New England Biolabs). After washing the resin with PBS three times, the proteins were eluted with glutathione buffer (10 mM glutathione and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) for GST-fused proteins or maltose buffer (10 mM maltose, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM sodium chloride) for MBP-fused proteins. The eluates were then digested by HRV 3C protease at 4\u02daC for overnight to remove the affinity tag. The proteins were further subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with 20 mM HEPES pH 6.8 and 150 mM sodium chloride by using Superdex 75 26/60 or Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare).

Manual model building was done with the COOT program (Emsley et al., 2010) . Ramachandran plot analysis with the program Rampage (Lovell et al., 2003) showed that 96.9% and 3.1% residues of the SpAtg8-SpHfl1 complex structure and 97.1% and 2.9% residues of the ScAtg8-ScHfl1 complex structure are in the favored and allowed regions, respectively. All structural models in this manuscript were prepared with the program PyMOL except for those with electron-density map (Figure 3 -figure supplement 2E and I), which were prepared with COOT.
