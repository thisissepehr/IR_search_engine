The expression of FAK and Akt in AECs were evaluated. In addition, recombinant FAK was administered to mice via the tail vein, and then the extent of lung injury was assessed. Mouse AECs were cultured in vitro, and FAK expression in cells under stretch was investigated. The effects of FAK on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were investigated. the results showed that HMV decreased fAK expression in Aecs of mice, while FAK supplementation attenuated lung injury, reduced protein levels/cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreased histological lung injury and oedema. The protective effect of FAK promoted AEC proliferation and migration and prevented cells from undergoing apoptosis, which restored the integrity of the alveoli through Akt pathway. Therefore, the decrease in FAK expression by HMV is essential for injury to epithelial cells and the disruption of alveolar integrity. fAK supplementation can reduce Aec injury associated with HMV.",

Moreover, over-pressure stress at the pathological level leads to cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, barrier dysfunction and the decreased synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins through the regulation of gene expression 1 .",

Activated FAK forms a complex with Src family kinases and then phosphorylates other proteins to regulate various cell events, such as apoptosis, migration, the immune response, cell differentiation, and cell shape. Multiple downstream signalling pathways of FAK have been identified, including PI3K-Akt-mTOR, ERK1/2, and JNK 3 . Previous studies have revealed that FAK plays an important role in the regulation of AECs. Unfried K et al. suggested that carbon nanoparticles can contribute to the proliferation of lung epithelial cells through the FAK-PI3K-Akt pathway 4 . Ding Q et al. suggested that FAK can inhibit apoptosis and promote the epithelial-myofibroblast plasticity of AECs 5 .",

Our data indicated that lung tissues from mice that underwent HMV treatment had a higher W/D ratio, more total cells and higher total protein content in the BALF than those of lung tissues from control mice that did not undergo mechanical ventilation. In lungs from mice that underwent HMV treatment, various pathological changes, including thickened alveolar walls, neutrophil infiltration, haemorrhage, and hyline membrane formation, were observed (Fig. 1) , and the lung injury score in the HMV group was significantly higher than that in the control group. Therefore, the results indicated that HMV can induce lung injury and lung oedema in vivo. Furthermore, we evaluated the FAK expression level in AECs by IHC, and the results showed that HMV treatment, compared to control, clearly decreased FAK expression levels, which is consistent with some other studies 6,7 . Moreover, using flow cytometry, we collected primary AECs from mouse lung tissues at different timepoints (0, 8, 24 h) after HMV treatment, and then we investigated FAK expression in AECs by western blotting. The results indicated that FAK expression was decreased significantly compared to that in the untreated controls, whereas there was no significant difference in FAK expression among the different time points (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). In addition, the phosphorylation of Akt was decreased in AECs after HMV treatment.",

Additionally, when the FAK-expressing cells were also treated with FAK inhibitor, the apoptotic cell percentage was significantly higher than that in cells not treated with the FAK inhibitor. fAK promotes cell migration and proliferation. To determine whether FAK plays a role in the migration and proliferation properties of cells, we measured the status of FAK-expressing and FAK knockdown MLE-15 cells. We found that ectopic expression of FAK promoted cell migration under CS conditions and that this effect was abrogated by a FAK inhibitor or FAK knockdown (Fig. 4A) . In addition, we tested the effect of FAK on cell proliferation in vitro. FAK-expressing MLE-15 cells displayed a higher proliferation rate compared to that of the controls. However, in FAK-expressing cells simultaneously treated with a FAK inhibitor and in FAK knockdown cells, proliferation was inhibited significantly (Fig. 4B) .

After FAK delivery, mice underwent HMV for 4 h. Then, 24 h after the experiment, the lung tissues were collected for further investigations. The data indicated that FAK protein levels were significantly increased after injection (Fig. 5A ). In addition, we investigated the phosphorylation of Akt using IHC, and the data showed that FAK delivery increased the phosphorylation of Akt in AECs (Fig. 5B) . Besides, our study showed that the in vitro expression of FAK promoted the phosphorylation of Akt in AECs (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). Moreover, FAK supplementation significantly improved the integrity of AECs and resulted in lower protein extravasation, lower cell counts in the BALF and a lower lung tissue wet/dry ratio ( Fig. 5C -E). HMV significantly increased the level of the alveolar epithelial injury marker RAGE 8 in the BALF (783.88 pg/ml compared to 285.75 pg/ml in the non-mechanical ventilation control, p = 0.00(F statistic: F = 0.130, p = 0.724)). In contrast, mice in which FAK was pre-delivered exhibited lower RAGE levels in the BALF compared to those in mice in which placebo was delivered, which indicates that FAK can attenuate alveolar injury (Fig. 5F ). Furthermore, after HMV, both the pathological injury score and apoptotic index of mouse lung tissues pretreated with FAK were significantly lower than those in the control mice (Fig. 5G,H) . However, FAK inhibitor treatment blocked the protective effect of FAK on the pathogenesis of VILI. The mice treated with FAK inhibitor exhibited significantly higher levels of multiple parameters of lung injury, including lung injury score, apoptosis index, BALF protein level, BALF cell counts, and the RAGE level in the BALF, than those exhibited by the mice treated with FAK alone, (Fig. 5C-H ).",

            "text": "In this study, we utilized both in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the effect of VILI on AECs. We present compelling results that VILI damages AECs and induces the loss of alveolar integrity. Our study found that VILI decreases FAK expression, while increasing FAK expression can attenuate VILI by facilitating the repair of epithelial cells. In addition, the protective effect of FAK may occur via the FAK-Akt pathway. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ FAK is known as a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that can be activated by autophosphorylation with conformational changes, and then phosphorylate other kinases, and plays roles in various cell events. It is known that mechanical stress, such as mechanical stress in cardiac myocytes 9,10 , shear stress in fibroblasts 11 , and stretch in endothelial cells 12 can modulate FAK expression in cells. Liu XY et al. found that FAK is crucial for type 2 AEC survival during tonic stretch 13 , while expression of FAK promotes the migration of type 2 AECs 14 . In another study, the FAK phosphorylation level was decreased when type 2 AECs were mechanically dissociated from the matrix in vitro 15 . Moreover, FAK plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Desai LP et al. suggested that HMV induces lung injury and decreases the level of FAK phosphorylation, which could determine the fate of AECs 6 . In a study on pulmonary fibrosis, Qiang D et al. found that blocking FAK can trigger the apoptosis Thereafter, the cells were exposed to CS conditions for 4 h, collected, stained with annexin V and PI and analysed by FACS. The number of apoptotic cells (Annexin V-positive cells) was indicated as the percentage of gated cells. Representative images and relative quantifications are shown. The results indicate that CS treatment promoted the apoptosis of MLE-15 cells. And the pro-apoptotic effect of CS was attenuated by FAK expression, while FAK knockdown promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of FAK was blocked by a FAK inhibitor. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 by two-tailed t test). control: no cell stretch treatment; CS: cell stretch treatment only; vector: transfection with vector followed by cell stretch treatment; AF: transfection with FAK recombinant adenovirus followed by cell stretch treatment; AF + DMSO: transfection with FAK recombinant adenovirus and treatment with DMSO followed by cell stretch treatment; AF + FAK inhibitor: transfection with FAK recombinant adenovirus and treatment with a FAK inhibitor followed by cell stretch treatment; scramble: transfection with scramble probe followed by cell stretch treatment; FAK siRNA: transfection with FAK siRNA followed by cell stretch treatment.

Furthermore, FAK knockout makes mice susceptible to lung injury. In a study by Wheaton AK et al., the deletion of FAK increased sensitivity to apoptosis in lung epithelial cells, and the anti-apoptotic effect of FAK occurred via blocking caspase-8 7 . Therefore, FAK may be involved in VILI by contributing to epithelial cell survival. In our study, we demonstrated decreased FAK expression in AECs that underwent VILI. FAK is shown to be upstream of the PI3K-Akt pathway, and FAK augmented the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K and Akt and then protected cells from apoptosis 16 . Therefore, decreased FAK expression decreases the activity of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Blocking PI3K-Akt inhibits cell proliferation and migration and sensitivity to apoptosis. During the pathogenesis of VILI, the mechanical stretching of AECs decreased the expression of FAK and downstream PI3K-Akt, which induced apoptosis of AECs, inhibits the proliferation of cells, and then destroy the integrity of alveoli. In contrast, the enhanced expression of FAK in AECs may maintain the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and lung function.",

            "text": "However, although our study showed the role of FAK in VILI, the potential pathway that regulates FAK in alveolar epithelial cells remains unknown. SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) proteins are known as transcription factors that contain subtypes of high-mobility-group domains and can bind to specific sequences in the minor groove of DNA. SOX11 knockout mice display hypoplasia of the lung 17 . In early 2019, we reported that the expression of both Sox11 and FAK in alveolar epithelial and interstitial cells is significantly downregulated in VILI and that the expression of these molecules is correlated 18 . In addition, the effect of FAK on the physiology of the lung remains controversial. For example, in another study, Lederer PA et al. suggested that a FAK antagonist improves the recovery of vascular endothelial cells during lung injury induced by endotoxins 19 . However, this study did not evaluate pathological changes in AECs in lung injury. We speculate that, compared to VILI, endotoxins can induce a more intensive inflammatory response and then destroy alveolar and vascular cells, while a FAK antagonist can block multiple downstream effects of FAK, including PI3K-Akt 20 and then inhibit the inflammatory response, which facilitates recovery. In our study, we found that FAK expression contributed to the repair of AECs, which indicates multiple roles of FAK in the pathogenesis of lung injury. However, besides AECs, some other types of cells in the lungs may express FAK under physiological or pathological condition. Researchers have also found that mechanical stress can facilitate lung fibrosis via activated FAK 21 , which is consistent with the complicity of FAK. FAK expression and activity are upregulated by TGF-\u03b21in fibroblast foci and remodelled vessels from lung fibrosis patients 22 , and then induce myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition. Conversely, Ghosh MC et al. argue that migrating cells have decreased levels of FAK phosphorylation 14, 23 . Therefore, we speculate that FAK may have different effects in different types of cells 7 . More research is needed to understand the role of FAK in lung injury. And Yalcin HC et al. designed a cell culture model for simulating cyclic airway closure/reopening in vitro, which can be used in studies to directly investigate role of FAK expression during the pathogenesis of lung injury 24 .",

The decreased FAK level impairs the regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, the delivery of FAK to AECs can reduce lung injury in response to VILI. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Center of Beijing University of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China), and all animal care procedures and experiments were conducted according to the ARRIVE guidelines and approved by the Committee of Ethics on Animal Experiments of Hebei Medical University. The mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 3% pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg body weight). During mechanical ventilation, additional doses of intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium were given depending on the depth of anaesthesia and the duration of the experiments. The mice were intubated with a 21 G steel endotracheal cannula via tracheostomy and connected to a rodent ventilator (Shenzhen, China). Then, mechanical ventilation was applied with room air, with a tidal volume of 30 ml/ kg, a respiratory rate of 75 breaths/min, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cm H2O for 4 h 25 . The mice were randomly divided into the following groups (8 mice per group): the non-mechanical ventilation control group; the HMV group; the HMV + FAK delivery group; the HMV + vehicle delivery group; the HMV + FAK delivery + FAK inhibitor (PF562271, purchased from Selleckchem, 25 mg/kg, dissolved in DMSO) group 26 ; and the HMV + FAK delivery + DMSO group. In the HMV group, mice underwent mechanical ventilation; in the HMV + FAK delivery/vehicle delivery/FAK inhibitor/DMSO group, the mice received FAK recombinant adenovirus, vehicle, FAK inhibitor, or DMSO injection via the tail vein before mechanical ventilation. In the control group, the mice underwent anaesthesia and endotracheal cannula via tracheostomy but did not undergo mechanical ventilation.

Ectopic FAK expression promoted wound closure, and this was blocked by a FAK inhibitor or FAK siRNA. (B) Cells received various pre-treatments and were then cultured for 72 h. Cell proliferation was measured using WST-1. The results showed that FAK overexpression increased cell proliferation compared to that in the controls transfected vector transfection, whereas a FAK inhibitor inhibited cell proliferation induced by AF.
