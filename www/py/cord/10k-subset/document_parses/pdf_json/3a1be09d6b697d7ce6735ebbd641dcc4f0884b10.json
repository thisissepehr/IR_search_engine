Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoforms ERK, p38, and JNK and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are mediators of impaired cerebral hemodynamics after TBI. Excessive tPA released after TBI may cause loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation either by over-activating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA-Rs) or by predisposing to intracranial hemorrhage. Our recent work shows that a catalytically inactive tPA variant (tPA-S 481 A) that competes with endogenous wild type (wt) tPA for binding to NMDA-R through its receptor docking site but that cannot activate it, prevents activation of ERK by wt tPA and impairment of autoregulation when administered 30 min after FPI. We investigated the ability of variants that lack proteolytic activity but bind/block activation of NMDA-Rs by wt tPA (tPA-S 481 A), don't bind/block activation of NMDA-Rs but are proteolytic (tPA-A 296-299 ), or neither bind/block NMDA-Rs nor are proteolytic (tPA-A 296-299 S 481 A) to prevent impairment of autoregulation after TBI and the role of MAPK and ET-1 in such effects.",

Findings were similar using either cut off. Fever was associated with DCI, worse mRS at discharge, and longer hospital stay. When controlled for baseline demographics and Hunt-Hess or Fisher group, fever (38\u00b0C) was a significant predictor of DCI (OR-1.7; p=0.02), mRS (OR-1.7;p<0.01) and longer hospital stay (OR-1.7;p<0.01). Tmax of patients with DCI was found to be significantly higher than those without DCI (p=0.04). Tmax between DCI and no-DCI groups separated on bleed day 2. In multivariate analysis Tmax on bleed day 2 and change in Tmax between bleed days 1 and 2 predicted occurrence of DCI, even after adjusting for covariates. No difference in WBC counts was seen between DCI and no-DCI groups or between patients with good versus poor outcomes. In general, there was a downward trend in WBC count in the first 6 days after SAH.",

Symptoms resolved within 30 minutes prior to reaching the ER. CT brain and CT angiogram of head and neck did not show any significant abnormalities. Later on the day of admission, the patient developed left sided hemiplegia. A second CT head was suspicious for air in multiple arteries of the right frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. A follow-up MRI brain revealed acute infarction of both hemispheres and the left cerebellum, with the majority of infarction in the right fronto-parietal lobes. Due to multi-territorial findings and worsening neurological exam, we suspected a persistent source of emboli to the brain. An emergent echocardiogram showed no shunts. This was followed by a CT chest, and no evidence of fistulae was found. The patient's mental status continued to deteriorate, and her exam became consistent with bi-hemispheric lesions. A subsequent Cardiac CT Angiogram suggested a fistula between the distal esophagus and the left atrium with air bubbles in the left ventricle.",

In this particular instance, the patient did not present with the most common signs of shortness of breath or retrosternal pain or fullness, but instead with an acute psychotic episode and refractory non-convulsive status epilepticus. Unique presentations such as this one often force healthcare providers to think \"outside the box\" when determining the cause of non-convulsive status. In late 2009, a previously healthy 19 year old female college student began having emotional labiality which quickly progressed to uncharacteristic hostility, religious preoccupation, and visual hallucinations. Shortly thereafter, she began seizing despite the fact that her head CT, MRI, and LP all lacked acute abnormalities. She was intubated and transferred to the neuro intensive care unit at our tertiary care center. Upon arrival patient was noted to have nystagmus, and rhythmic facial movements, as well as an EEG confirming non-convulsive status. The status epilepticus was refractory to a variety of treatments including; benzodiazepines, multiple anti-epileptic drugs (phenytoin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, valproate, and phenobarbital), repeated drug induced coma, resection of a mature mediastinal teratoma, intravenous steroids, rituximab, and plasmapheresis. Her seizures were eventually controlled using felbamate. Once the neoplasm was removed, the episodes of psychosis resolved suggesting they were likely secondary to the anti-NMDA antibodies. Besides status, her critical care course was complicated by limbic encephalitis, acute respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, and bilateral pneumothoraces. After a prolonged hospital course, she was eventually discharged with minimal functional deficits, and able to return back to college full-time.",

To evaluate her chest pain, a body CT with contrast was performed, and showed a linear enhancing lesion within the spinal cord at levels T10-L1. A conventional spinal angiogram revealed a 5mm, partially thrombosed, fusiform aneurysm at the level of L1, arising from a descending ramus of the anterior spinal artery. MRI of the total spine confirmed the presence of diffuse blood products throughout the subarachnoid space anterior to the cord, supporting rupture of this aneurysm and upward extension into the perimesencephalic space as the cause of her headache and chest pain. The aneurysm was surgically accessed via a T11-T12 laminectomy and clipped. A follow up spinal angiogram showed no residual filling of the aneurysm.

However, herniation can occur with normal (<20mmHg) ICP values. We describe a case of normal pressure herniation (\"NPH\") from global cerebral edema with normal ICP values.Methods/Result: Case report. We describe a 46 year old male who presented with coma (GCS =7) after a severe (modified Fisher 4) aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured anterior communicating artery (ACOMM) aneurysm with bilateral frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhages (IPH). The aneurysm was coiled and an external ventricular drain placed to monitor ICP. Several hours later, he underwent bifrontal craniectomy due to refractory elevated ICP (>20mmHg) despite mannitol, hypertonic saline, and had the frontal IPH's evacuated but the bone flap replaced. The CT scan demonstrated global cerebral edema (GCE) with diffuse effacement of sulci and loss of space around brainstem. On postoperative day 5, the patient had progressive loss of pupil reactivity (3mm reactive OU to 7mm unreactive OU) with downward brainstem herniation on MRI despite ICP's ranging from 8-18mmHg. The patient underwent redo bifrontal craniectomy with bone flap removal. The patient remained comatose and repeat MRI demonstrated progressive downward herniation of the midbrain and pons into the posterior fossa despite ICP values being <15mmHg. The family eventually withdrew care due to vegetative state.",
