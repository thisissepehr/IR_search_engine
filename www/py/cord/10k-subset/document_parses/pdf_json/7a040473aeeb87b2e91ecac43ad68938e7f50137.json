The reported 3year DFS is also around 20%, with most patients failing due to leukemic relapse. 4 Purging of the marrow with monoclonal antibodies or cytotoxic agents was initially regarded as a promising approach to reduce the rate of relapse, 11 but the currently available uncontrolled data show no apparent benefit. 4 Unfortunately, there have been few controlled studies comparing results of allogeneic and autologous BMT in similar patients with advanced ALL, with no significant differences in DFS. 4, 12 Regrettably, in none of these studies are the data for adults and children reported separately, and the latter undoubtedly have much better short-and long-term outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 395, "end": 397, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 398, "end": 399, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 661, "end": 662, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 885, "end": 886, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1073, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1076, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "However, a more important caveat in these transplantoriented reports is that they do not give a realistic idea of the real impact of BMT in the overall therapeutic strategy for refractory or relapsed adult ALL. This is an important concept since these subjects must overcome many obstacles before actually reaching BMT, but we have found only two other studies addressing this issue. 13, 14 In our study, of the initial 37 patients, only 29 achieved CR, and only 19 actually reached SCT (65% of those attaining CR and 51 % of all initially treated). This loss of patients pretransplant was mainly due to early relapse, since 9/19 autologous SCT candidates relapsed before the transplant. However, 3/10 1026 One alive at +27.5 months following isolated cutaneous relapse (+3 months) treated with X-ray therapy. patients who relapsed before the assigned alloSCT underwent the transplant since early relapse was not a contraindication for the procedure. Arcese et al 13 reported the results of a GIMEMA multicenter salvage protocol. One hundred and sixty-eight patients (including 72 adults) were included, with a CR rate of 64% (56% in adults and 70% in children). However, 53% of complete remitters did not reach BMT, and only 30% of all initially treated patients underwent BMT, with a projected 3-year actuarial DFS of 52% for allogeneic BMT and 29% for ABMT recipients. Recently, these Italian investigators reported a follow-up study in adults only which confirmed significantly worse results than for children. 15 Specifically, only 9/61 adults initially treated reached BMT (26% of CR), five ABMT and four alloBMT. Five relapsed a median of 4 months post BMT and four were alive (1/5 ABMT and 3/4 alloBMT) with a median follow-up of 43 months. Freund et al 14 reported a German multicenter salvage protocol which enrolled 66 adults with refractory or relapsed ALL. The initial CR rate was 60%, but again, only 22 patients reached BMT, representing 33% of the initial 66 cases. Of the 13 who received an allogeneic BMT, five were alive, but the follow-up was short (1-18 months, median 13). All nine ABMT recipients had relapsed at a median of 4 months (range 1-12), as did all non-transplanted patients (median DFS of 2.9 months). These data suggest that at present an allogeneic transplant appears to be the best treatment approach for adults with relapsed or refractory ALL. Monoclonal-antibody purged autologous SCT does not appear to be an effective treatment for adult ALL in second CR or relapse. Even though purging strategies have undoubtedly improved and will improve further in the near future, they will probably not lead to better results in this setting; a recent large IBMTR study which includes children and adults has shown a relapse risk of 50-70% at 2 years for ALL allografted in second CR without GVHD and of 30% for those patients who developed GVHD. 16 Thus, a graft-versus-leukemia effect appears to exist in ALL, making it unlikely that even a highly purged stem cell autograft will significantly decrease the risk of relapse. On the other hand, matched volunteer unrelated donor transplants are an attractive alternative for these patients, [17] [18] [19] but only 10-50% will have a suitable A,B,DR-matched donor, and availability of the marrow usually requires 4-6 months from the start of the search. 19 Since second CRs usually last few months, most patients with a donor will be in relapse with progressive leukemia at BMT, which is associated with a poor outcome. 17, 18 Other alternatives are cord blood transplants 20 and, especially for adults, partially mismatched related donor stem cell transplants. 21 This latter approach has the advantage of rapid access to large numbers of stem cells, allowing for a transplant before disease progression. 22 In summary, few adults with relapsed or refractory ALL actually reach a stem cell transplant in CR. Autologous SCT offers little, if any, potential for long-term survival in these patients, and an allogeneic stem cell source should be rapidly sought after CR has been achieved, including experimental alternative donor transplant protocols in subjects under the age of 55 without an HLA-identical sibling.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 387, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 388, "end": 390, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 964, "end": 966, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1517, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2877, "end": 2879, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3171, "end": 3175, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3176, "end": 3180, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3181, "end": 3185, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3334, "end": 3336, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3500, "end": 3503, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3504, "end": 3506, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3553, "end": 3555, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3642, "end": 3644, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3786, "end": 3788, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Strategies for the treatment of recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Bassan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Lerede", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Barbui", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1996, "venue": "Haematologica", "volume": "81", "issn": "", "pages": "20--36", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Impact of reinduction regimens for relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Welborn", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "Am J Hematol", "volume": "45", "issn": "", "pages": "341--344", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Chao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Forman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "618--628", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Autologous bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Ritz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Ramsay", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Kersey", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "731--742", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
