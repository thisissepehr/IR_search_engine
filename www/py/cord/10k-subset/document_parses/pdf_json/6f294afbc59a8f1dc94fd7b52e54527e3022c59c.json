In contrast, mortality rates associated with 2009 H1N1 infection in patients with hematologic tumors or HSCT recipients have been reported to be up to 46 % [6] , even though these rates vary considerably among studies, accounting for variable underlying conditions and settings [1] [2] [3] [6] [7] [8] . Our present report demonstrated that nosocomial 2009 H1N1 outbreak in the hematology ward can lead to fatal clinical outcome at a markedly high rate, i.e. 3 (43 %) of 7 patients with hematologic tumors and 3 (60 %) of 5 HSCT recipients. In one report, nosocomial acquisition of the virus itself was recognized as a risk factor requiring admission to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation [3] . Therefore, it is desirable for all healthcare workers in hematology wards to implement stringent infection control measures during an influenza season. On the other hand, risk factors identified by the data collection from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the Spanish Group of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients who developed 2009 H1N1 infection, including age, lymphopenia (\\300/ll), and neutropenia (\\500/ll) [9] , were not necessarily applicable to our cases (Tables 1, 2) . Pathogenesis of pneumonia/respiratory failure associated with 2009 H1N1 infection has not fully been established [4] . Viral RNA may be detected in secretions from the lower respiratory tract up to 28 days after the onset of severe pneumonia and longer in patients with immunosuppression [4] . In contrast, respiratory specimens from cases 3 and 5 of our cohort became negative for RIDT 22 and 29 days after the onset of influenza, while their pulmonary diseases rapidly deteriorated, suggesting that the virus alone may not have been responsible for the progression of respiratory failure or development of ARDS.

Since case 5 was initially infected with the wild-type virus and was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit localized in the independent ward (Figs. 1, 2) , and since the other two patients were each isolated in a single-patient room following infection-control measures, it is unlikely that the mutant virus was transmitted among these 3 patients, but rather H275Y mutants seem to have developed independently in each patient. The Infectious Disease Surveillance Center . On the other hand, the risk of the 2009 H1N1 virus developing the H275Y mutation that confers oseltamivir resistance is considered to be higher in immunocompromised patients [3] . Our present report suggests that universal chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir for severely immunocompromised patients, such as HSCT recipients, during an outbreak can facilitate the development and/or selective growth of the oseltamivir-resistant virus. This is in clear contrast with immunocompetent hosts, in whom an oseltamivir ''ring'' prophylaxis was effective in reducing the impact of outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 in semi-closed environments without emergence of the H275Y strain [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 734, "end": 737, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1224, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 241, "text": "(Figs. 1, 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Given that the response to the influenza vaccination is significantly reduced in immunocompromised patients [13] , even though patients receiving the influenza vaccine 6 months or later after HSCT had a lower risk for virological confirmed influenza [14] , anti-virals are central to the treatment of 2009 H1N1 infection. It is apparent that the standard dose and duration of oseltamivir, i.e. 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, are insufficient for immunocompromised patients. Instead, an increased dose and duration of oseltamivir, as well as combining this treatment with other available anti-viral drugs, may be initiated at the onset of symptoms of influenza irrespective of the severity of the illness.
