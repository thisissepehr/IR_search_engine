How do we answer the questions \"Why me?\" and \"Why now?\" when we are diagnosed with disease? How do we paint what we know is there but cannot see? Modern medicine, like much pre-Impressionistic art, tried to square this circle by instituting a technical and professional gaze that filters out the ephemera of the individual in order to identify and name what is hidden by opaque bodies (see, of course, Foucault 1994) .

As Fairchild et al. note: Contemporary decisions about whether to reveal the identity of those with disease who posed a public health threat have turned on assessments of the risk to the community. In Texas, in response to a 1993 investigation of a case of fatal hantavirus, state health officials refused to disclose the name of an infected individual to the local media. A 1999 case of meningitis in a Maryland school was not sufficient for the County's Director of Community and Environmental Health to identify the student by name. The official, however, suggested that had more people been at risk for contracting the disease, it may have been deemed appropriate to identify the infected student by name, even over the objections of her parents. Such criteria were met in the case of SARS. In the 2003 outbreak in Toronto, the names of the first two cases, a mother and son, were released to the press for the purpose of identifying and advising people who might have had contact with them (Fairchild et al. 2007, 10) .",

The Spanish nurse who contracted the virus while caring for Spain's \"patient zero\" (a priest who returned from Africa with the virus and then died) was treated with some sympathy, despite initial suggestions from her superiors (similar to the government's response in the United States) that she had deviated from protocol. However, her pet dog Excalibur received much greater expressions of sympathy and support, particularly when Excalibur was ultimately euthanized as a precautionary measure regardless of showing no symptoms of Ebola or scientists possessing much knowledge of canine susceptibility to the virus (Wilson 2014) .",

Unfortunately, many today still see HIV/AIDS as a disease of an \"other,\" rooted in Africa and/or homosexuality, and even \"just desserts\" for stigmatized behaviors. While Ebola was initially viewed (and also disregarded) in the same way-as an African phenomenon-this has very rapidly changed as individuals \"closer to home\" have become infected. Moreover, Ebola and HIV are different. Although both are viruses spread via bodily fluids (and neither is very durable outside the human body), \"Ebola is transmitted when a person is sick, usually very sick, and you have to come into direct contact with bodily fluids. So it's difficult not to know you're exposed\" (Anthony Fauci cited in Siegel 2014, \u00b615) . Those with HIV, on the other hand, may remain symptomless but infectious for years, making it much harder to identify and combat infection. Treatments also vary; where one is acute and relies on \"good supportive care and the patient's immune response\" (CDC 2014, \u00b65), the other is ongoing and requires multiple, expensive antiretrovirals.",

America has the best doctors and public health infrastructure in the world, so we're ready to deal with it'\" (White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer cited in Hudson 2014, \u00b65)-intimating, like others have stated more explicitly, that the shortcomings in African health care infrastructures don't exist in the Western world (see, e.g., Welsh and Jennings 2014; The Daily Targum 2014; Editorial Board 2014) . But as the events that began on September 30 at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas have illustrated, people in public health glass houses shouldn't throw (shepherd's crook-shaped) stones. Through political posturing and colonialist bravado, the United States has created a House of Mirrors optical illusion in representing its health care system as \"the best in the world,\" \"with the best health care professionals on Earth, the finest health care institutions, the best medical research, the most sophisticated technology,\" this despite the fact that U.S. morbidity and mortality rankings make the American health system \"arguably the worst in the developed world\" (Rich and Simmons 2011, 63-64). 2 Amid the warped reflections then come calls for closing borders and the creation of vaccines (as if this were the first Ebola case or the first Ebola epidemic in the world).
