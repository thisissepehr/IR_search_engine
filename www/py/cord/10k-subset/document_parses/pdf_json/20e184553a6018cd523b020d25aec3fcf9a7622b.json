Systemic absorption of intraperitoneal chemotherapeutics may lead to drug-induced toxicity, most commonly neutropenia. Mitomycin C has been the most commonly used chemotherapeutic in HIPEC for the past several decades. Case presentation: Here, we describe a rare pulmonary complication secondary to intraperitoneal administration of mitomycin C. Conclusions: While rare, intraperitoneal mitomycin C has the potential to cause serious pulmonary toxicity that should be considered with administration. To our knowledge, this report represents only the second case described in the literature.",

This patient was ultimately diagnosed with ARDS beginning 2 days post-therapy due to a constellation of factors that include acute-onset respiratory insufficiency with an FiO2/paO2 of 250, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, and lack of cardiogenic pathology. The presence of a degree of myelosuppression in this patient, as evidenced by the drop in her ANC and hematocrit postoperatively, confirms an element of systemic absorption of MMC, which supports the diagnosis of MMC toxicity-induced ARDS. Given the negative infectious workup, a noninfectious cause for ARDS in this patient was strongly favored. The strong temporal relationship with administration of intraperitoneal mitomycin C and development of pulmonary toxicity also favors drug toxicity as the inciting cause for ARDS. Given the well-established relationship between systemic mitomycin C and development of interstitial pneumonitis, the pulmonary and critical care teams strongly favored this diagnosis. However, given the patient's relatively rapid recovery, no lung biopsy was performed and empiric steroid therapy was never instituted.",

Following this publication, pulmonary toxicity continued to be reported as a rare but well-known side effect of MMC, with occurrence rates of 5 to 12 % [17] . The first prospective study on the relationship between intravenous MMC and pulmonary toxicity concluded that this toxicity is a dose-dependent side effect of MMC that should be considered only when patients receive over a 20 mg/m 2 cumulative dose [18] . This model was supported by later pharmacological evidence that there is a direct relationship between body surface area and MMC plasma clearance, as well as between plasma exposure and hematological toxicity [14] . Recommendations of this study were to use a dose of 25 mg/m 2 , divided into three portions of 50 % at the beginning of treatment, 25 % after 30 min, and 25 % after another 30 min, in order to limit the incidence of leukopenic side effects to 10 %.",

This case similarly demonstrated systemic penetration of MMC despite dosing according to established guidelines. Unlike the patient presented here, however, the previous case describes a case of interstitial pneumonitis 37 days following therapy, requiring steroids but without need for intubation. Both accounts draw attention to the potential for respiratory toxicity associated with HIPEC MMC.",

These events should be monitored for and treated aggressively, and further cases must continue to be reported to bring insight to the mechanisms that underlie this process, which patients may be at increased risk, and how dosing of HIPEC MMC might be altered to avoid further complications.",
