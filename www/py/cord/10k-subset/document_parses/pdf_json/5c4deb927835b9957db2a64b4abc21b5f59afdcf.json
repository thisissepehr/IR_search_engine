We cloned 58 lipoproteins from A. pleuropneumoniae JL03 (serovar 3) and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Five proteins with strong positive signals in western blotting analysis were used to immunize mice.

Great efforts have been devoted to the characterization and control of porcine pleuropneumonia in the past 30 years, and considerable achievements have been made. A total of 18 serovars of A. pleuropneumoniae have been identified till now, all of these serovars are able to colonize pigs 2 . Since A. pleuropneumoniae is susceptible to drying and other antibacterial factors, direct transmission from infected to susceptible healthy pigs is considered to be the most frequent means by which the disease spreads 3 . Airborne transmission of A. pleuropneumoniae was also confirmed to occur over a short distance (1 m) 4 . Pigs of all ages are susceptible to A. pleuropneumoniae infection, especially fattening pigs at about 3-months old, and the first outbreak in herds often leads to high morbidity and mortality 5 .

Therefore, vaccination is a one of the most promising strategies for the control of porcine pleuropneumonia 9 . Several types of vaccines against this disease, including inactivated vaccine, subunit vaccine, ghost vaccine, DNA vaccine, edible vaccine, heterologous vaccine and live attenuated vaccine, have been developed in recent years 10 .

Advantages of inactivated and subunit vaccines in the control of porcine pleuropneumonia are recognized, but some defects are notable. Bacterin-based inactivated vaccines often show limited cross-serovar protection, and subunit vaccines protect animals from death, but do not eradicate the invading bacteria completely 9 .

It is worth noting that a number of hypothetical proteins (APJL_0221, APJL_1318, APJL_1380, APJL_1469, APJL_1726 and APJL_1976) yielded clearly positive reactions with rabbit anti-A. pleuropneumoniae serum in western blotting. Two hypothetical lipoproteins, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976, were selected for further investigation. On the basis of in silico analysis, APJL_1380 is homologous to E. coli outer membrane, penicillin-binding protein activator LpoA, which is reported to stimulate the transpeptidase activity of peptidoglycan synthase PBP1A and thus regulate peptidoglycan synthesis 40, 41 . However, the roles of LpoA in immunological protection and pathogenesis have not been addressed before. Here, our data showed that APJL_1380 elicited effective protection in animals in both active and passive immunization assays. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the vaccine potential of the LpoA lipoprotein homolog from \u03b3-proteobacteria. The hypothetical protein APJL_1976 is homologous to the H. influenzae NlpD. NlpD has been identified as being cell-surface located and is important for membrane stability of H. influenzae 42 , and it is reported to be essential for pathogenicity of Yersinia pestis 43 . Immunization with APJL_1976 could induce high IgG titer and confer partial protection against infection with virulent A. pleuropneumoniae.
