However, its role in the regulation of furin-dependent proprotein processing remains unclear. Here we report that histone H1 efficiently blocks furin-dependent pro-von Willebrand factor (pro-vWF) processing in a dose-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies confirmed that histone H1 could interact with furin, and the interaction mainly took place on the cell surface. We noted that histone H1 was released from cells undergoing necrosis and apoptosis induced by H 2 O 2 . Our findings suggested that histone H1 might be involved in extracellular and/or intracellular furin regulation.",

Furin (EC 3.4.21. 75, FURIN) was the first identified and the most extensively studied mammalian PC, responsible for the activation of substrates ranging from blood clotting factors, serum proteins, growth factors and hormone receptors to matrix metalloproteinases, viral coat proteins and bacterial exotoxins [2] . Thus, furin is an attractive therapeutic target for intervention in many diseases. Several inhibitors against furin have been designed. Two of the most potent are the peptidyl inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CH 2 Cl and the bioengineered serpin protein \u03b11-Antitrypsin (AT) Portland (known as PDX) [3] . In addition, there are other reported inhibitors: polyarginines [4] , Drosophila Serpin 4 [5] , eglin c mutants [6] and the barley serine proteinase inhibitor 2-derived cyclic peptides [7] . Some inhibitors have been used to prevent the activation of bacterial toxin, the processing of envelope glycoprotein in viral replication and the metastasis of cancer [8\u221210] .",

            "text": "Our previous studies have identified that histone H1 is a potent furin inhibitor with a Ki value of 460 nM. Its inhibitory activity relies on its C-terminal lysine-rich domain, composed of approximately 100 residues, and the inhibitory reactive site of this domain has also been pinpointed [11] . Compared with other furin inhibitors, histone H1 is more attractive, both from a basic research view and in terms of its application potential, as it is an endogenous and nontoxic protein that might be more suited to use as a therapeutic agent. It has been shown that furin can process an extensive range of precursor proteins in the trans Golgi network (TGN)/biosynthetic and endocytic pathway, at the cell surface and possibly within the extracellular matrix following shedding. It remains to be determined whether proteolytic cleavage of extracellular matrix substrates for furin is carried out by the membrane anchored or the shed form of furin. Many studies have shown that the shedding of furin, which occurs rapidly and intracellularly, might depend on the integrity of the conformation of the enzyme's cysteine-rich region [12] . Although histone H1 normally binds to the linker DNA and is located in the nucleus, it was reported that histone proteins could be located on the surface of various cells [13, 14] . Moreover, added histones including H1 were found to be able to penetrate through the plasma membrane into HeLa and Colo-205 cells, and the cellular uptake was mostly due to direct translocation through the cell plasma membrane, not to the endocytosis [15] . Therefore, we are interested in whether the extracellular histone H1 could regulate furin activity at the cell surface or in the extracelluar matrix.",

In contrast, the co-transfection with furin resulted in the disappearance of pro-vWF, indicating a complete conversion of pro-vWF to the mature form [ Fig. 1(A) , lane 3] . To examine whether histone H1 could regulate the furin intracellular processing of protein precursors, 48 h after transfection with pro-vWF, histone H1 with different concentrations (1 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M) were added to the culture medium for an additional 4 h.

As expected, H 2 O 2 dose-dependently increased cell death when analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after staining with annexin-V FITC and PI [ Fig. 4(A) ]. The corresponding serum-free culture media were immunoprecipitated with an equal amount of anti-histone H1 and analyzed by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 4(B,C) , a small amount of histone H1 could be detected in the serum-free culture media in the absence of H 2 O 2 , which indicated that in normal cells histone H1 could be released outside the cells. When cell death increased, histone H1 noticeably released from cells [ Fig. 4(B) ]. The quantity of released histone H1 was calculated from three independent experiments. It was noted that the relative amount of histone H1 released in the presence of 2 mM H 2 O 2 was approximately 4-fold higher than that in the absence of H 2 O 2 [ Fig. 4(C) ]. This result indicated that, in cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis, more histone H1 was released outside the cells, leading to possible interaction with furin.",

Some endogenous inhibitors, such as 7B2 against PC2 [21] and proSAAS against PC1 have been reported [22] . Furin has become a therapeutic target because of its critical role in many cellular events associated with infections such as HIV [23] and SARS [24] , activation of bacterial exotoxins [25] and metastasis of cancer [8] , as well as the development of atherosclerosis [26] and Alzheimer's disease [27] . PI8 [28] and histone H1 C-terminal fragments [11] are known as possible mammalian endogenous inhibitors of furin, but their physiological role as furin inhibitors has not been fully investigated. PI8 is a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, and the re- combinant PI8 is able to inhibit porcine trypsin, human thrombin, human coagulation factor Xa, and the Bacillus subtilis dibasic endoproteinase subtilisin A [29] . Furthermore, the distribution pattern of PI8 in human tissues is different from that of furin. PI8 is mainly expressed in the nucleus of squamous epithelium of mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and epidermis, and in the epithelial layer of skin appendages, particularly in more differentiated epithelial cells [30] . Due to their different distribution patterns, PI8 seems very unlikely to interact with furin in vivo. As permanent inhibition against furin in vivo would be harmful to cells, the temporary inhibition of histone H1 [11] would be more ideal to regulate furin activity. Furthermore, histone H1 and its C-terminal part have many advantages over other inhibitors for its small size and nontoxic properties. As pro-vWF is well known to be processed by furin [17, 31, 32] , it was also used as a model protein to study the inhibition of furin-dependent proprotein processing by inhibitors added to the culture media, such as exogenous eglin C variants [33] . In this study, the efficacy of histone H1 in cellular inhibition of proprotein processing by furin was also shown. As described, furin can process precursor proteins in the TGN/biosynthetic and endocytic pathway, at the cell surface and possibly within the extracellular matrix following shedding. The inhibition of this processing by histone H1 added in the culture media [ Fig. 1(B) ] suggested that histone H1 might be involved in the regulation of furin both in the intracellular and/or in the extracelluar processing events. Our results of the co-immunoprecipitation of furin with histone H1 suggested that the interaction between histone H1 and furin possibly occurs under physiological conditions. Although we could not exclude the possibility that some of the cell disruption enables the interaction of histone H1 from lysed nuclei with furin, our data confirms that furin and histone H1 could interact with each other, possibly on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. The interaction in the latter could not be detected using immunofluorescence because of the lower amount of furin.",

However, it was reported that histone proteins could be located on the surface of various cells, including intestinal microvilli, monocytes and lymphocytes [13, 14] . In addition, histone H1 proteins act as intestinal protein receptors for 987P fimbriae of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [34] . Histone H1 is not only located in the nucleus bound to the linker DNA, but can also be found on the cell surface and outside cells. Our results further confirm that, under physiological conditions, a portion of histone H1 exists outside cells and, under pathological conditions, histone H1 can be markedly released from cells (Fig. 4) , suggesting that histone H1 most likely inhibits furin on the cell surface in vivo. The immunofluorescence studies further showed that furin, vWF and histone H1 could be co-localized on the cell surface. Treatment of cells with H 2 O 2 markedly induces cell death and consequently the release of histone H1, http://www.abbs.info; www.blackwellpublishing.com/abbs which mimics pathological conditions such as cell death induced by infection with bacteria or virus. Under these situations the released histone H1 might function as a regulator to down-regulate the activity of furin and then inhibit the maturation of bacterial exotoxins and viral glycoproteins.",

            "text": "Growing evidence shows that histone H1 belongs to a family of proteins with numerous biological functions [35, 36] . The proteolytic fragments of histone H1 released from epithelia possess strong antimicrobial activities [37\u221239] and histone H1 exerts growth inhibition in leukemia cells in vitro, ex vivo and in an animal model [40] . Furthermore, histone H1 was reported as a tumor suppressor in experimental mammary carcinoma [41] . Our results showing that histone H1 is capable of inhibiting furin might help to explain these functions, because furin plays a central role in the activation of bacterial exotoxins and in the metastasis of cancer. As a result, the inhibition of furin by histone H1 will correspondingly show antimicrobial and anticancer activity, and might represent a basic, conserved mode of post-translational control. Combining these findings we speculate that histone H1 existing outside cells or released from the cell nucleus might be involved in the regulation of furin in the proprotein processing events. We can only hope that these findings will help us better understand the complexity of furin's action in proprotein processing, as well as help us to explore the possibility of developing new therapeutic agents using furin inhibitors and regulators.",
