The process of protein ubiquitylation -which is catalysed by coordinated enzymatic reactions that are mediated by enzymes known as E1, E2 and E3 -has an important role in the modulation of immune responses. Importantly, protein ubiquitylation is a reversible process, and removal of ubiquitin molecules is mediated by de-ubiquitylating enzymes: for example, A20, which has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses. In addition, the conjugation of ubiquitin-like molecules, such as ISG15 (interferon-stimulated protein of 15 kDa), to proteins is also involved in immune regulation.

This discovery of a non-lysosomal pathway of protein degradation led to Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Irwin Rose being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2004. Following the initial, groundbreaking experiments, scientists then defined the cascade of reactions that mediates ubiquitin conjugation. This includes at least three steps (FIG. 1a) : first, the carboxy (C)-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, known as enzyme 1 (E1), resulting in the formation of a highenergy THIOESTER BOND between the glycine residue of ubiquitin and the cysteine residue of the active site of E1; second, the activated ubiquitin is transferred to the cysteine residue of the active site of a ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (known as E2); and third, the ubiquitin-E2 complex is recruited to a third enzyme, a ubiquitin-protein ligase (known as E3), which specifically binds a protein substrate and facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to a lysine residue in the substrate 2, 3 .",

The family of RING-type E3 ligases can be further subdivided into two groups: single-protein E3 ligases, such as CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma), in which the RING-finger domain and substrate-recruiting domains are found in one polypeptide; and multisubunit E3 ligases \uf6aeBOX 1\uf6af.

In these complexes, RBX1 binds ubiquitinloaded E2, and the F-box protein specifically recruits the protein substrate and helps to transfer ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate. In both single-protein and multisubunit E3 ligases, the protein-recruiting domain or subunit is the crucial determinant of the specificity of the ubiquitylation process, which occurs through protein-protein interactions that are well defined at a biochemical level.",

Monoubiquitylation can occur on a single lysine residue or on several lysine residues in a substrate, leading to multiple monoubiquitylation. The ubiquitin molecules in a polyubiquitin chain are generally linked through the lysine residue at position 48 or 63 (and are known as K48-and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, respectively); however, other lysine residues in a ubiquitin molecule have been shown to participate in linkage. Interestingly, the different types of polyubiquitin chain have different effects on the substrate. Although ubiquitin was originally proposed to deliver a 'kiss of death' , targeting the tagged protein to the cellular waste-disposal machinery (that is, the 26S proteasome), recent studies have shown that ubiquitylation of proteins has a broad impact on many cellular processes, including modification of protein function, facilitation of cell-surfacereceptor turnover and control of gene transcription 4 . For example, monoubiquitylation is involved in downmodulation of receptor expression through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway 5 , and K63-linked polyubiquitylation modulates protein-protein interactions 6 . By contrast, K48-linked polyubiquitylation targets substrates for proteasomal degradation.",

It has been shown that a wide range of peripheral-tissue antigens -such as insulin, thyroglobulin and myelin proteolipid protein -are promiscuously expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Thymocytes encountering these antigens at the surface of mTECs are then subject to central-tolerance mechanisms and become tolerant to those antigens 10 . Genetic studies of a rare human autoimmune disease known as AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINOPATHY\uf6baCANDIDIASIS\uf6baECTODERMAL\uf6baDYSTROPHY SYNDROME (APECED) underscore the importance of central tolerance 11, 12 . The gene that is responsible for APECED has been identified as the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE), and more than 50 linked mutations have been mapped in human patients. AIRE is highly expressed in the thymus, particularly by mTECs 13 . Targeting of the Aire gene in mice causes the development of spontaneous multi-organ autoimmunity, similar to that of human patients with APECED 14, 15 . Notably, the expression of peripheraltissue-specific proteins such as prepro-insulin and cytochrome p450, which are known targets of autoreactive T cells in human patients with APECED, is decreased in AIRE-deficient mTECs in mice 14 . Deficiency in AIRE, however, did not change the number of thymocytes, the proportion of thymocytes that constitute particular subsets or the activation status of thymocytes, indicating that AIRE does not affect thymocyte development. So, AIRE seems to have an important role in central tolerance through regulating the promiscuous expression of peripheral-tissue self-antigens by mTECs (FIG. 2a) . DNA-microarray analysis further indicates that AIRE affects the expression by mTECs of genes that encode molecules involved in intrathymic cell migration, such as MHC molecules and certain chemokines 16 .",

But how this E3-ligase activity is coupled to regulation of gene transcription is still unclear. Furthermore, that AIRE has E3-ligase activity is disputed by an independent research group 21 .",

Recent studies, however, have provided molecular insights that improve our biochemical understanding of T-cell anergy induction. Treatment with IONOMYCIN or TCR ligation in the absence of co-stimulation leads to upregulation of expression of several E3 ligases, including CBL-B, itchy (ITCH) and gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) [35] [36] [37] . These E3 ligases downmodulate the function of phospholipase C-\u03b31 (PLC-\u03b31) and protein kinase C-\u03b8 (PKC-\u03b8), signalling molecules that are crucial for T-cell activation; therefore, this blocks activation of downstream signalling pathways that are essential for IL-2 production and T-cell proliferation 36 (FIG. 2b) .

This discrepancy might reflect the different time points that were examined in the two studies: at earlier time points of restimulation, anergic T cells might only show modified PLC-\u03b31 phosphorylation 37 ; by contrast, at later time points, effects on PLC-\u03b31 degradation might become evident 36 . Because early signal transduction is crucial for determining whether T-cell recognition of antigen induces proliferation and IL-2 production, early attenuation of PLC-\u03b31 phosphorylation could be an essential step for T-cell anergy induction. Whether CBL-B-regulated PLC-\u03b31 degradation has a role in T-cell anergy induction needs to be established using Cblb mutants that lack E3-ligase activity. Moreover, PLC-\u03b31 is unlikely to be the only target molecule for the E3-ligase activity of CBL-B in anergic T cells. To gain a clear answer, more-comprehensive proteomics approaches need to be used to identify specific substrates of particular ligases.",

Roquin is an E3 ligase, the mutation of which in mice is linked to a severe SYSTEMIC\uf6baLUPUS\uf6baERYTHEMATOSUS \uf6aeSLE\uf6af\uf6baLIKE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE 41 . Systematic screening of N\uf6baETHYL\uf6baN\uf6baNITROSOUREA\uf6baINDUCED MUTANT MICE led to the identification of a mutant mouse line that had an autoimmune phenotype similar to SLE: that is, high levels of autoantibody production, and nephritis with IgG deposition. The mutation causes intrinsic T-cell dysregulation, including increased numbers of FOLLICULAR B HELPER T CELLS with augmented inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) expression and IL-21 production. The mutation was mapped to a novel gene and was found to be a T to G point mutation that results in a methionine to arginine amino-acid substitution. The encoded protein, which is known as roquin, contains an amino (N)-terminal RING-finger domain followed by a unique ROQ domain and an RNA-binding zincfinger domain, as well as several other domains. It seems that roquin belongs to a large family of proteins that are highly conserved from invertebrates to humans and have as-yet-unknown functions. Interestingly, the N-terminal RING-finger domain is similar to the RING-finger domain of CBL and of TRAFs (tumournecrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR)-associated factors), indicating that roquin functions as a RING-type E3 ligase. Roquin is localized in the cytoplasm (with a distinct dot-like appearance) together with T-cellinduced antigen 1, a translational silencing factor that is a component of cytoplasmic stress granules, which are implicated in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability 42 . This colocalization implies that roquin might function as a regulator of mRNA stability and/or translation. It should be noted that the point mutation that was identified in the mutant mice occurs in the ROQ domain, leading the authors to speculate that this mutation might alter the structure of roquin and therefore affect its biological function. However, whether this particular mutation affects the E3-ligase activity or the function of the RNA-binding zinc-finger domain awaits further investigation. Furthermore, the role of roquin in immune tolerance would be explained by identification of the substrate for its E3-ligase activity, which is unknown at present.",

Similar to Itch -/-T cells, this mutation in MEKK1 resulted in increased concentrations of JUN and JUNB, but not JUND, in T cells. In addition, the concentrations of other transcription factors that are important for the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into T H 2 cells, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1; also known as NFATc2), GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) and MAF, were reported to be normal. Subsequent biochemical studies showed that MEKK1 functions upstream of ITCH activation, with JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) functioning downstream of MEKK1 to effect phosphorylation of ITCH and, most importantly, upregulation of its E3-ligase activity 48 . This defines a signalling cascade that is initiated by TCR ligation and depends on MEKK1, and that results in JNK activation, ITCH phosphorylation and activation, and JUNB degradation. This cascade has a crucial role in modulating the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into T H 2 cells (FIG. 3) . In fact, ITCH is the first HECT-type E3 ligase (but probably not the only one) that has been found to have its catalytic activity directly regulated by its phosphorylation. Consistent with this model, studies using mice that are deficient in JNK or MAPK kinase 7 (MAPKK7), a kinase that relays MEKK1 activation to JNK, showed similar phenotypes: that is, T cells that lack either JNK or MAPKK7 produce more T H 2 cytokines than wildtype T cells 49 . Therefore, at least in T cells, contrary to the commonly held idea that the MEKK1-JNKmediated phosphorylation of JUN-family proteins is the main pathway that controls downstream gene transcription, the control of JUN-protein turnover through phosphorylation of an E3 ligase (that is, ITCH) seems more pertinent to the biological functions of MEKK1 and JNK.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained largely unexplored. The proposed function of the MEKK1-JNK-ITCH cascade in differentiation into T H 2 cells might shed light on this long-standing paradox. It can be speculated that, when T cells receive a weak signal, the MEKK1-JNK pathway, which requires a strong co-stimulatory signal 52 , is not initiated, so T cells express large amounts of JUNB, which directs T H 2-cytokine production. By contrast, when T cells are strongly activated, the MEKK1-JNKsignalling pathway is switched on; this results in the phosphorylation and activation of ITCH, which leads to the turnover and degradation of JUN proteins and therefore to the dampening of differentiation into T H 2 cells. However, this attractive hypothesis needs to be tested: for example, by using mice transgenic for TCRs with varying affinities for peptide-MHC complexes.",

This complex interacts with TRAF6, which directly associates with BCL-10-MALT1 \uf6aeREF. 58\uf6af. The BCL-10-MALT1 complex induces Triggering of various cell-surface receptors leads to assembly of a multimolecular complex that includes the RING (really interesting new gene)-type E3 ligase TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor receptor (TNFR)associated factor 6). TRAF6 recruits the ubiquitin-loaded E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13) and promotes K63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitylation of IKK-\u03b3 (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase-\u03b3) and activation of the IKK complex. Phosphorylation of I\u03baB by the IKK complex recruits an SCF complex (S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1)-cullin-1 (CUL1)-F-boxprotein complex), which is an E3 ligase that induces K48-linked polyubiquitylation of I\u03baB.

Several of these proteins are known to function as de-ubiquitylating enzymes. oligomerization of TRAF6 and activation of its E3-ligase activity. Strikingly, BCL-10-MALT1 alone can target IKK-\u03b3 for K63-linked polyubiquitylation, even in the absence of TRAF6 \uf6aeREF. 60\uf6af. It has therefore been suggested that the formation of the BCL-10-MALT1 complex leads to a conformational change in the complex, which results in recruitment of ubiquitin-bound UBC13 as an E2. Because BCL-10 and MALT1 also form oligomeric complexes with IKK-\u03b3, the binding of ubiquitin-UBC13 to a BCL-10-MALT1 complex allows the transfer of ubiquitin to IKK-\u03b3 for K63linked polyubiquitylation. Therefore, even without a physical RING-finger domain, the BCL-10-MALT1 complex can function as an E3 ligase. Consistent with these biochemical studies, loss of CARMA1, BCL-10 or MALT1 results in defective NF-\u03baB activation in both T cells and B cells 61 . TCR ligation has also been shown to induce the recruitment of PKC-\u03b8 to plasma-membrane lipid rafts and the activation of PKC-\u03b8, and this has been implicated in NF-\u03baB activation (as has the BCL-10-MALT1 complex) 62 . However, the exact mechanisms by which PKC-\u03b8 'communicates' with the IKK complex and induces NF-\u03baB activation have remained unclear. But a recent study has indicated that 3-phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates PKC-\u03b8 and thereby allows PKC-\u03b8 to recruit the IKK complex to the plasma membrane 63 . PDK1 also functions as an adaptor that physically associates with CARMA1, which then recruits the BCL-10-MALT1 complex to lipid rafts, forming a super-complex that induces K63-linked polyubiquitylation of IKK-\u03b3 (mediated by the BCL-10-MALT1 and, probably, TRAF6 components).",

            "text": "The pleiotropic cytokine TNF elicits a broad range of immune and inflammatory responses by inducing NF-\u03baB activation. Unlike antigen-receptor signalling, which depends on tyrosine phosphorylation, the binding of TNF to TNFR induces the formation of a signalling complex that includes TRADD (TNFR-associated via death domain), RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1), TRAF2 and A20 \uf6aeREF. 64\uf6af. Formation of this complex helps to recruit the IKK complex to the vicinity of the activated receptor, and it is required for activation of the IKK complex. Similar to TRAF6, TRAF2 functions as an E3 ligase and promotes K63-linked polyubiquitylation of molecules such as RIP1 \uf6aeREF. 65\uf6af. It is conceivable that K63-linked RIP1 might facilitate downstream NF-\u03baB signalling. A20 was originally discovered as a TNF-inducible gene product, and it functions as an inhibitor of TNF-induced signalling 66 . Importantly, ablation of A20 results in augmented responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide and TNF by thymocytes and fibroblasts 67 . A20 -/mice develop multi-organ inflammation and die at a young age. Loss of A20 seems to result in increased kinase activity of IKK and in prolonged activation of NF-\u03baB. Structurally, A20 is characterized by the presence of an OTU \uf6aeOVARIAN TUMOUR\uf6af DOMAIN linked to multiple zinc-finger domains in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Database searches showed that the OTU domain is characteristic of a superfamily of otubains, a group of putative cysteine proteases 68, 69 . This family of proteins contains conserved ubiquitin-interacting and ubiquitin-associated motifs that are commonly found in de-ubiquitylating enzymes, indicating that these proteins function as de-ubiquitylating enzymes. Indeed, A20 was later found to be a de-ubiquitylating enzyme for K63-linked polyubiquitylated RIP1, thereby leading to termination of TNF-induced NF-\u03baB signalling 70 . This is not the end of the story. A20 also functions as an E3 ligase and recruits one of the E2 proteins UBCH5A or UBCH7 using its C-terminal zinc-finger domains (which also mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate), to promote the ubiquity lation of RIP1 \uf6aeREF. 70\uf6af. In this reaction, the polyubiquitin chain is K48-linked and targets RIP1 for proteasomal degradation. Importantly, A20-induced ubiquitylation of RIP1 occurs after its de-ubiquitylation. Therefore, A20 is a dual-function enzyme: first, it operates as a de-ubiquitylating enzyme, removing the K63-linked polyubiquitin chain from RIP1; and second, it operates as an E3 ligase, promoting K48-linked polyubiquitylation of RIP1 and thereby targeting it for degradation (FIG. 5) . By functioning as a 'double-edged sword' , A20 prevents the over-reaction of innate immune responses. It remains unclear, however, whether A20 removes and adds ubiquitin molecules on the same lysine residues of RIP1 or on different residues.",

Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a multifunctional cytokine that is implicated in the regulation of various aspects of immune responses. Ablation of TGF-\u03b2 or expression of a dominant-negative TGF-\u03b2 receptor results in aberrant lymphocyte proliferation and multi-organ inflammation 77, 78 . TGF-\u03b2 also has an important role in the inhibition of CD4 + T-cell differentiation into T H 1 and T H 2 cells, by reducing expression of T-bet and GATA3 or by inhibiting phosphorylation of the TEC-family kinase ITK (IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase) [79] [80] [81] . Recently, TGF-\u03b2 has also been shown to convert naive CD4 + CD25 -T cells in the periphery into T Reg cells (which are CD4 + CD25 + ) through induction of expression of a crucial transcription factor, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) 82 . Collectively, these results indicate that TGF-\u03b2 is an important cytokine in immune homeostasis and tolerance induction. TGF-\u03b2-mediated signalling is initiated by binding of the cytokine to its receptors, which are heterodimeric transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, and this is followed by phosphorylation of a family of SMADs (mothers against decapentaplegic homologues), translocation to the nucleus by these proteins and sub sequent regulation of gene transcription 83 . SMADs can be divided into three groups: receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs; such as SMAD2 or SMAD3), commonmediator SMADs (Co-SMADs; such as SMAD4) and inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs; such as SMAD7). Many studies have documented that the SMAD-signalling pathway, which is highly conserved, is subjected to regulation by ubiquitylation. At least two factors that regulate the ubiquitylation of SMADs, SMAD ubiquity lation regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) and SMURF2, have been characterized as HECT-type E3 ligases 84, 85 . Structurally, the WW domains of SMURFs bind PPXY motifs in some SMADs 84 . However, SMURFs can either inhibit responses to TGF-\u03b2 by inducing the degradation of SMADs 86 or increase signalling in response to TGF-\u03b2 by inducing the degradation of SKI-related novel protein N (SnoN), a transcriptional repressor of SMADs that works by forming an inhibitory SMURF-SMAD-SnoN complex 87 . In addition, SMURF2 can bind the I-SMAD SMAD7, which forms a complex with the TGF-\u03b2 receptor, thereby targeting the TGF-\u03b2 receptor for ubiquitylation and degradation 88 .",

The TGF-\u03b2-induced arrest in growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts was not found to occur in ITCH-deficient mice. Surprisingly, ITCH was not found to affect the protein stability of either SMADs or SnoN. Instead, ITCH bound SMAD2 and promoted its ubiquitylation. It seems that ubiquitylation of SMAD2 increases its TGF-\u03b2induced phosphorylation: ITCH facilitates the formation of a complex between the TGF-\u03b2 receptor and SMAD2 through ubiquitylation of SMAD2, leading to an increase in TGF-\u03b2-induced gene transcription. So, ITCH functions as a positive regulator of TGF-\u03b2-mediated signalling through proteolysisindependent ubiquitylation. Whether this function of ITCH has a role in immune regulation, such as in T-cell differentiation or T Reg -cell generation, awaits further investigation.",

The SOCS family has eight closely related members -SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, SOCS4, SOCS5, SOCS6, SOCS7 and cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein (CIS) -and each contains an SH2 domain and a C-terminal SOCS\uf6baBOX DOMAIN 90 . Expression of SOCS proteins is induced after stimulation with cytokine. The SH2 domains of SOCS proteins then associate with phosphorylated tyrosine residues in activated JAKs, and this attenuates the kinase activity of these JAKs. The importance of this family of proteins became further evident following studies of gene-targeted mice. Socs1 -/mice show neonatal lethality, severe lymphopaenia, upregulated lymphocyte apoptosis and multi-organ lymphocyte infiltration [91] [92] [93] . The hyper-responsiveness of Socs1 -/lymphocytes was attributed to heightened IFN-\u03b3-mediated signalling, which results in augmented phosphorylation of STAT1.",

This multi-protein complex is now known as an ECS complex (elongin-B-elongin-C-CUL5-SOCSprotein complex), and it is an E3 ligase 94, 95 . In these complexes, CUL5 functions as a scaffold that binds elongin-B-elongin-C, a SOCS protein (which directly binds the substrate) and the RING-finger-domainonly protein RBX2 (which recruits ubiquitin-E2 complexes) (FIG. 6) . ECS complexes are analogous to SCF complexes, and together they form a subgroup of the multisubunit RING-type E3 ligases \uf6aeBOX 1\uf6af. In the case of SCF complexes, the F-box protein recruits a specific protein substrate; by contrast, in the case of ECS complexes, the SOCS protein targets the ECS complex to a particular substrate and facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate. Consistent with predictions from its structure, SOCS1 has been shown to promote the conjugation of ubiquitin to JAK2, VAV1 and the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB (also known as REL-A) [96] [97] [98] . Interestingly, it has been shown that, in genetically modified mice in which the SOCS-box domain of SOCS1 has been deleted, there are increased responses to IFN-\u03b3, and such mice develop chronic multi-organ inflammation 99 . So, SOCS proteins are a crucial component of these multi-protein E3 ligases that bind a specific target and help to promote its ubiquitylation.",

ISG15 is activated by an E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UBE1L) and is then transferred to UBCH8, which functions as an E2 for ISGylation of substrates 102, 103 . So far, several signalling molecules, including PLC-\u03b31, JAK1 and ERK, have been identified as substrates for ISG15 conjugation 104 .

Biochemically, UBP43 functions as a protease that specifically removes ISG15 from the proteins to which it is conjugated 105 . However, ablation of Ubp43 in mice leads to hypersensitivity to POLYINOSINIC\uf6bbPOLYCYTIDYLIC ACID (poly I:C), with reduced survival rates and decreased numbers of peripheral-blood cells and bone-marrow cells 106 . The JAK-STAT-signalling pathway is highly upregulated in Ubp43 -/cells following stimulation with type I IFNs, and this is accompanied by augmented cell death. In mouse models of viral infection, it was recently found that Ubp43 -/mice are highly resistant to lethal inoculation with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus 107 . Viral replication in Ubp43 -/cells is abrogated, presumably as a result of the hyper-responsiveness to type I IFNs. This study shows the importance of a balance between ISGylation and de-ISGylation in the regulation of innate immune responses to viral infection. However, a more recent study showed that deficiency in ISG15 does not affect IFN-induced activation of STATs and immune responses to viral infection 108 . It should also be noted that UBP43 is itself regulated by ubiquitindependent degradation mediated by the multisubunit E3 ligase SCF SKP2 , in which SKP2 is the F-box protein that recruits the substrate 109 , indicating that there is another layer of control, which involves ISGylation, de-ISGylation and ubiquitylation.
