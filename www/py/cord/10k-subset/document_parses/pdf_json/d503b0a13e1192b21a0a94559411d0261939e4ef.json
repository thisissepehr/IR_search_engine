However, their antiviral functional residues and specific mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we firstly resolved the topology of IFITM1 on the plasma membrane where N-terminus points into the cytoplasm and C-terminus resides extracellularly. Further, KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 locating at 62-67 of the conserved intracellular loop (CIL) were found to play a key role in the restriction on the Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV). Similarly, KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 also contributed to suppressing ZIKV replication. Finally, IFITM1 was revealed to be capable of restricting the release of ZIKV particles from endosome to cytosol so as to impede the entry of ZIKV into host cells, which was tightly related with the inhibition of IFITM1 on the acidification of organelles. Overall, our study provided topology, antiviral functional residues and the mechanism of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins.",

            "text": "Human interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1/2/3 (IFITM1/2/3) is widely expressed in different tissues and organs, and the expression level of these proteins is regulated by interferon [1] . They contain 125-133 amino acid residues and have two transmembrane domains. The topologies of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are similar. They all consist of five parts, including short N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), intramembrane domain 1 (IM1) and intramembrane domain 2 (IM2), and short conserved intracellular loop (CIL) [2] . At least three possible topological models of IFITMs have been reported [3] . One model is that N-terminus and C-terminus reside extracellularly or in intracavity, IM1 and IM2 stretch across the phospholipid bilayer and CIL resides in the cytoplasm. The second model is that N-terminus, C-terminus, and CTD are in the cytoplasm, and IM1 and IM2 are in the phospholipid bilayer. The third model is that N-terminus and CIL reside in the cytoplasm, and CTD resides extracellularly or in intracavity [3] . Therefore, the exact topology of IFITMs is still to be investigated. IFITM proteins are involved in the regulation of many activities, such as tumorigenesis [4] and immune signal transduction [5] . Most importantly, it has been reported that IFITM proteins have a broad antiviral spectrum in recent decades. IFITM proteins can effectively block a variety of enveloped viruses from invading host cells, such as influenza A virus (IAV) of Orthomyxoviridae [6] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of Pneumoviridae [7] , ZIKV and DENV of Flaviviridae [8, 9] , ebolavirus (EBOV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) of [10] . On the other hand, IFITM proteins also restrict some nonenveloped viruses, such as reovirus (ROV) [11] . Additionally, IFITMs have almost no inhibitory effect on certain viral infections, such as adenovirus (AdV) [12] and Sendai virus (SeV) [13] . Although IFITMs play critical antiviral roles in the innate immune system, their antiviral functional residues are mostly still unclear. There is a report showing IM1 of IFITM3 is required for both the interaction of IFITM protein and the restriction of IAV and DENV [9] ; therefore, vital antiviral functional residues of IFITM1 are to be determined.",

Although they share a high identity of amino acid sequences ( Figure 1A ) and are able to inhibit a wide range of viruses, IFITM1/2/3 still have different antiviral activities and spectra. To determine if the intracellular distribution of IFITM proteins influences their antiviral activities, we analyzed their intracellular location. The cDNA sequences of IFITM1/2/3 were cloned from HEK293T cells by RT-PCR and then were inserted into pcDNA3.1 plasmid with BamHI and XhoI, where a Flag-tag was added to their N-terminus ( Figure 1B ). The overexpression level of pcDNA3.1-Flag-IFITM1/2/3 was detected, and the result showed that they were greatly expressed compared with the control ( Figure 1C ). Na + /K + -ATPase is a biomarker of the plasma membrane [19] . We analyzed the colocalization of IFITM1/2/3 and Na + -K + ATPase by immunofluorescence using the anti-Flag antibody and Na + /K + -ATPase antibody coupled with Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488. The experimental data showed that IFITM1 distributed on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. IFITM1 especially had strong colocalization with Na + -K + ATPase ( Figure 1D ). In comparison, IFITM2 and IFITM3 appeared to reside only in cytoplasm ( Figure 1D ). These data indicate IFITM1 distributes widely on the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The colocalization of IFITM1/2/3 and Na + -K + ATPase in HEK293T cells; pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-Flag-IFITM1/2/3 were transfected in HEK293T cells.

However, the other antiviral functional residues of IFITM1 are still unclear. Therefore, eight alanine scan (AS) mutants of the IFITM1 CD225 domain were constructed and named ( Figure 3A ). Vero cells were kidney cells of the monkey Chlorocebus sabaeus from Africa, which was easily infected by ZIKV [22] . We observed the location of IFITM1/2/3 fused with a Flag-tag in Vero cells; the result showed that over-expressed IFITM1 was located both on cell membranes and in the cytoplasm, while IFITM2 and IFITM3 appeared to reside only in the cytoplasm in Vero cells ( Figure S2 ). Then, we compared the inhibitory effects of IFITM1 and eight AS mutants against ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain) in Vero cells. The result showed that IFITM1 inhibited 78% ZIKV E protein compared with the control, while 52AS, 56AS, 60AS, 64AS, 68AS, 72AS, 76AS and 80AS mutants limited 34%, 2%, 65%, 14%, 84%, 86%, 39% and 37% intracellular ZIKV E protein, respectively ( Figure 3B,C) . Relative intracellular ZIKV E protein was analyzed using ImageJ. These results suggest that 52AS, 56AS, 64AS, 76AS and 80AS mutants of IFITM1 have a weaker antiviral effect than IFITM1 does, and these mutated amino acid residues of IFITM1 may be potential antiviral functional determinants.",

Then, we analyzed the antiviral effects of these five mutants. The results showed that 1-KRRK had the least inhibitory activity against ZIKV in Vero cells, and R64A and K67A appeared to have less antiviral effect than the IFITM1 by qPCR ( Figure 3E ) and Western blotting ( Figure 3F,G) . However, K62A and R66A still shared similar anti-ZIKV activity with the wild type IFITM1 ( Figure 3E-G) . The amino acid sequences of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the CD225 domain were almost the same as those of IFITM1 ( Figure 1A ). To determine if the KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 are also key for their antiviral functions, Flag-IFITM2-KRRK and Flag-IFITM3-KRRK plasmids were constructed. K82, R84, R86 and K87 of IFITM2, and K83, R85, R87 and K88 of IFITM3 were simultaneously mutated to alanine ( Figure 3H) . Similarly, IFITM2/3 and 2/3-KRRK were used to analyze the antiviral function against ZIKV. We found that both IFITM2 and IFITM3 had a great limitation on the intracellular ZIKV E protein, while 2-KRRK and 3-KRRK had less restriction than their wild types ( Figure 3I ,J). These data show the KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 are also significant to suppress ZIKV infection.",

The result showed that IFITM1 could decrease the expression of intracellular DENV E protein compared with the control, while 1-KRRK had almost no influence on DENV replication ( Figure 4A,B) . Therefore, the KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 also played a key role in the restriction on DENV. SeV, a negative single-stranded RNA virus, is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. AdV is a nonenveloped double-strand DNA virus. We asked whether the KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 had an influence on the infection of SeV and AdV. The results showed that both IFITM1 and 1-KRRK hardly had inhibition on the relative intracellular SeV RNA, compared to the control ( Figure 4C ).

The life cycle of ZIKV can be divided into four stages, including viral entry, genome replication, viral assembly and release [25] . ZIKV enters host cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this process, the viral envelope and the endosome membrane of host cells are fused under the acidic environment of the endosome; then, the viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm [26] . Previous studies have shown that IFITM proteins can inhibit the entry of ZIKV [8] ; however, how IFITM1 inhibits this stage is still unknown. Here, we detected the influence of IFITM1 and 1-KRRK on the release of ZIKV from the endosome to the cytosol. By electron microscopy, we observed IFITM1 prevented more virus particles from being released into the cytoplasm, compared with the negative control, while 1-KRRK virtually unlimited the release of virus particles ( Figure 6A ). Specific results were counted and shown in Figure 6B , suggesting that IFITM1 did restrict the release of ZIKV from the endosome to the cytosol. In addition, the colocalization of IFITM1 and acidic organelles was detected. Rab5 and Rab7, members of the RAS GTPase superfamily, are mainly located in early endosomes and late endosomes, respectively [27] . LAMP1 is the main constituent protein of the endosome/lysosome pathway [28] . Therefore, we detected the colocalization of IFITM1 and Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1. Indeed, we found that IFITM1 was partially co-located with early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes ( Figure 6C ). This was consistent with previous reports that exogenous IFITM1 can localize on cell membranes and in highly acidified late endosomes and lysosomes [29, 30] . We then detected the organelles acidity of Huh7 cells after being over-expressed by IFITM1 and 1-KRRK by a flow cytometer using a 488 nm laser for excitation. Compared with the control group, the curve of IFITM1 shifted to the left, and the curve of 1-KRRK was between IFITM1 and the control ( Figure 6D ). These data suggested that IFITM1 could inhibit the acidification of organelles, and 1-KRRK had weaker suppressive power than IFITM1 did. Therefore, IFITM1 can restrict the release of ZIKV from endosome to cytosol, which is related with its inhibition on organelles acidification. More importantly, the KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 are vital in these processes.",

Previous studies have shown that IFITM proteins can inhibit the entry of ZIKV [8] ; however, how IFITM1 inhibits this stage is still unknown. Here, we detected the influence of IFITM1 and 1-KRRK on the release of ZIKV from the endosome to the cytosol. By electron microscopy, we observed IFITM1 prevented more virus particles from being released into the cytoplasm, compared with the negative control, while 1-KRRK virtually unlimited the release of virus particles ( Figure 6A ). Specific results were counted and shown in Figure 6B , suggesting that IFITM1 did restrict the release of ZIKV from the endosome to the cytosol. In addition, the colocalization of IFITM1 and acidic organelles was detected. Rab5 and Rab7, members of the RAS GTPase superfamily, are mainly located in early endosomes and late endosomes, respectively [27] . LAMP1 is the main constituent protein of the endosome/lysosome pathway [28] . Therefore, we detected the colocalization of IFITM1 and Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1. Indeed, we found that IFITM1 was partially co-located with early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes ( Figure 6C ). This was consistent with previous reports that exogenous IFITM1 can localize on cell membranes and in highly acidified late endosomes and lysosomes [29, 30] . We then detected the organelles acidity of Huh7 cells after being over-expressed by IFITM1 and 1-KRRK by a flow cytometer using a 488 nm laser for excitation. Compared with the control group, the curve of IFITM1 shifted to the left, and the curve of 1-KRRK was between IFITM1 and the control ( Figure 6D ). These data suggested that IFITM1 could inhibit the acidification of organelles, and 1-KRRK had weaker suppressive power than IFITM1 did. Therefore, IFITM1 can restrict the release of ZIKV from endosome to cytosol, which is related with its inhibition on organelles acidification. More importantly, the KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 are vital in these processes. ",

We found that the KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 were important for the restriction of IFITM1 on ZIKV and DENV. It has been reported that the 80AS and 85AS mutants of IFITM3 have weaker restrictions on IAV and DENV replication than wild type [9] . To further illustrate the importance of these four residues, we also compared the antiviral effects of IFITM2/IFITM3 and their corresponding KRRK mutant. Indeed, the KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/IFITM3 also played a key role in their restriction on ZIKV. Significantly, we found that IFITM1 can restrict the release of ZIKV from endosome to cytosol to prevent the entry of viral particles into host cells, which was associated with its inhibition on organelles acidification. Attractively, 1-KRRK had almost no restriction in this process. Significantly, we found KRRK residues of IFITM1 were very conservative in many species by aligning their amino acid sequences ( Figure S4 ). We hypothesize that KRRK residues of IFITM proteins of other species may play important roles in their antiviral effects.",

Importantly, we found that the KRRK basic residues of IFITM proteins played a vital role in their antiviral processes. In addition, our work provided new insights into the antiviral mechanism of IFITM1 related to inhibiting organelles acidification. The previous research also showed that the endosomes in HULEC cells with a high basal level of IFITM3 were less acidic than in MDCKs [35] . The mechanism may be applicable to explain how IFITM1 restricts other viruses entering cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, our work could not explain why the KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 are vital for IFITM1 to inhibit viral entry and suppress organelles acidification. The isoelectric point (pI) of IFITM1 with a Flag-tag is 6.2, predicted by the ProtParam website, and the pH values of the late endosome and lysosome are 5.0-5.5 and 4.6-5.0, respectively [36] . Therefore, we hypothesize that IFITM1 may alkalize the acidic organelles by its own properties; besides, the pI of 1-KRRK with a Flag-tag is 5.1 predicted by the ProtParam website, which may explain that 1-KRRK hardly affects the acidification of organelles.",
