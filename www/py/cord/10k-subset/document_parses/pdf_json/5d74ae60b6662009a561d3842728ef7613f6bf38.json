We analysed two OAS1 regions encompassing alternatively spliced exons. While the region carrying the splice-site variant is neutrally evolving, a signature of long-standing balancing selection was observed across an alternative exon 7. Analysis of variants in this exon identified an insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs11352835, A/-) that originates predicted products with distinct C termini. This variant is located along the major branch of the haplotype genealogy, suggesting that it may represent the selection target. A case/control study for MS indicated that rs11352835 is associated with disease susceptibility (for an allelic model with the deleted allele predisposing to MS, OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.072-1.513, p = 0.010). No association was found between rs10774671 and MS. As the two SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium in Europeans, the previously reported association between rs10774671 and MS susceptibility might be driven by rs11352835, possibly explaining the contrasting results previously observed for the splicesite polymorphism. Thus, we describe a novel susceptibility variant for MS in OAS1 and show that population genetic analyses can be instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In humans four 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase genes (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL) are located on the long arm of chromosome 12 and play a central role in the innate immune response against viruses.

The association between OAS1 polymorphisms and T1D is still controversial, with discordant results obtained in different studies (Qu et al. 2009; Smyth et al. 2006; Tessier et al. 2006; . In the case of MS, OAS1 SNPs and haplotypes have been associated with both disease susceptibility and severity (Fedetz et al. 2006; O'Brien et al. 2010) . In particular, the A allele of rs10774671 (the splicealtering variant in exon 6), which originates protein isoforms with lower antiviral activity, was shown to confer both an increased risk to develop MS and a higher likelihood to have a more severe form of disease in a population from Ireland (O'Brien et al. 2010) . Conversely, a previous study in a Spanish cohort found no association between this variant and MS susceptibility, although the authors found a rare haplotype to be more common in patients versus controls (Fedetz et al. 2006) . Antiviral response genes are an obvious target of natural selection as virus-borne infections have represented, and still represent, a major threat to human populations. Our previous data (Fumagalli et al. 2010) suggest that some overlap may exist among genes subjected to virusdriven selective pressure and loci involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Population genetic analyses of candidate gene regions can be regarded as instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits. Here we analysed two gene regions in OAS1 and verified that while the region carrying the functional splice-site altering variant is neutrally evolving, longstanding balancing selection has shaped nucleotide diversity in a gene portion encompassing the alternative exon 7.

Conversely, fewer analyses have focused on the selective patterns shaping the intra-specific diversity of alternatively spliced genes. Here we selected for analysis the two gene regions in OAS1 that encompass alternatively spliced exons. As mentioned above, at least five transcripts originate from OAS1, one of these is genetically determined by the presence of a splice-acceptor variant and gives rise to protein products with different antiviral activity Lin et al. 2009 ). The splice-acceptor polymorphism has also been associated with altered susceptibility to viral infections (Lim et al. 2009 ), indicating this region as a possible selection target. Surprisingly, our resequencing analysis in three human populations showed that OAS1 r1 is neutrally evolving, as all tests failed to reject the null hypothesis of selective neutrality. Low diversity indexes were observed for this region in YRI, but the MLHKA test revealed that polymorphism levels were not exceptionally low compared to inter-specific diversity; moreover, calculation of Fay and Wu's H (Fay and Wu 2000) , which detects an excess of high-frequency derived alleles, in both OAS1 r1 and OAS1 r2 yielded results consistent with selective neutrality in YRI (not shown), suggesting that weak negative selection (as opposed to positive selection) may be acting on OAS1 r1 in African populations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 170, "text": "(Xing and Lee 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 171, "end": 190, "text": "Lu et al. 2009a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 191, "end": 206, "text": "Ke et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 207, "end": 229, "text": "Zhang and Chasin 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 230, "end": 251, "text": "Plass and Eyras 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 252, "end": 273, "text": "Chen and Chuang 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 274, "end": 295, "text": "Ermakova et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 756, "end": 771, "text": "Lin et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 881, "end": 897, "text": "(Lim et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1376, "text": "Fay and Wu's H (Fay and Wu 2000)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Conversely, data herein indicate that the region encompassing the alternatively spliced exon 7 has been a target of long-standing balancing selection in Europeans and Asians. Inclusion of this exon in the OAS1 transcript originates a p44 isoform (Fig. 1 ) whose antiviral activity has been poorly characterized. A recent report indicated that, among all OAS1 isoforms, only p42 and p46 display strong antiviral activity against Dengue virus (Lin et al. 2009 ). The reason for the differential activity of OAS1 proteins is presently unknown, as all isoforms display the catalytic OAS domain (which is located at the N terminus). Our analysis indicated that an A insertion/deletion 0.00E+00 5.00E+05 Clade A Clade B Fig. 3 GENETREE analysis for OAS1 r2 . Mutations are represented as black dots and named for their physical position along the region. The absolute frequency of each haplotype is also reported. Note that mutation numbering does not correspond to that reported in Fig. 2 polymorphism (A/-, rs11352835) is located on the major branch that separates the two haplotype clades, indicating that this variant, or one in linkage to it, may represent the selection target in OAS1 r2 . The derived deleted allele determines a frame shift that is predicted to result in the inclusion of 22 additional amino acid residues compared to p44. Given the differential activity observed against Dengue virus for p42 and p44 (which only differ by 35 terminal amino acids) (Lin et al. 2009 ), it is tempting to speculate that similarly, such a minor change in sequence composition may alter the antiviral potential of OAS1. One interesting possibility is that the different composition of the C terminus affects the specificity of OAS1 against different viral species. An alternative explanation for our findings is that the selection target is accounted for by a regulatory variant/haplotype with a role in transcription modulation, as several expression QTLs for OAS1 have been identified in the gene region encompassing exon 7 (http://eqtl. uchicago.edu/). Although further analyses will be required to identify the selection target in OAS1 r2 , our data provide evidence that a functional polymorphism is located within this region, as signatures of long-standing balancing selection are expected to extend over relatively short genomic regions (Charlesworth 2006 ). Thus, we reasoned that a susceptibility variant for MS might be located in this region, as well, possibly explaining the previous contrasting results obtained for the splice-acceptor SNP in different MS cohorts. Indeed, while a strong relationship was recently described between the G allele of rs10774671 and protection from MS in a population from Ireland (O'Brien et al. 2010 ), a previous report in a Spanish sample revealed no such association, despite similar cohort sizes in the two studies (about 400 cases/controls) (Fedetz et al. 2006) . Our results on an Italian sample indicated that the A allele of rs11352835, but not the splice-site variant, is significantly associated with protection from MS. Given that the two variants have very similar frequency in the Italian sample, the estimated power to detect association is also comparable, and reaches 78% assuming an OR of 1.27 and a sample size as the one we analysed. The relatively tight LD of the two SNPs (r 2 = 0.87) suggests that association between rs10774671 and MS susceptibility is driven by rs11352835. Therefore, minor differences in the level of LD in cohorts with distinct geographic origin might account for the contrasting results previously observed for the splice-site polymorphism. In this respect, it is also worth mentioning that insufficient sample size is regarded as a major explanation for several inconsistent associations reported in the scientific literature. This consideration may apply to previous studies on the role of OAS1 in MS, which relied on relatively limited patient/control samples (Fedetz et al. 2006; O'Brien et al. 2010 ). Here we genotyped larger MS/HC cohorts compared to previous studies; our data confirm that OAS1 represents an MS susceptibility gene, and refine the association signal to a variant different from, but in linkage with, the one previously described to associate with disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 441, "end": 457, "text": "(Lin et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1482, "text": "(Lin et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2360, "text": "(Charlesworth 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2742, "text": "(O'Brien et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2909, "text": "(Fedetz et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3950, "end": 3970, "text": "(Fedetz et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3971, "end": 3990, "text": "O'Brien et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 253, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 714, "end": 720, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 977, "end": 983, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, our population genetic analysis indicates that the OAS1 gene region harbouring the functional spliceacceptor polymorphism is neutrally evolving, and the variant itself shows no association with MS in Italians.

In line with previous reports (Grossman et al. 2010) , our work demonstrates that population genetic approaches can be regarded as instrumental to the identification of selection targets and, consequently, of functional polymorphisms with an effect on phenotypic traits. This observation suggests that the ever-increasing availability of resequencing data, obviously including the 1000 Genomes Project (http://browser. 1000genomes.org/), can be exploited to identify selection signatures at the genome-wide level and this information, in turn, may be used to prioritize variants to be typed in association analysis for complex diseases and traits.
