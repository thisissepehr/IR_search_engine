Logistic regression showed that a longer duration of critical care work experience was associated with a lower level of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Pediatric healthcare providers had a lower rate of emotional exhaustion compared to adults, but no difference in depersonalization or professional accomplishment. There was no statistic difference between academic vs community centers in any domain. Analysis of the Areas of Worklife Survey showed a very strong association between five of the six subscales (workload, control, reward, fairness and values) and two of the three burnout domains (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). 55.2% of participants reported moral distress at least a few times a month and 29.9% reported it at least once a week. Conclusions: Burnout and moral distress is a significant issue for nurses, respiratory therapists and physicians who work in the ICUs in the Department of Critical Care, Halifax, Nova Scotia. This knowledge will help provide direction for management and support for our critical care healthcare providers moving forward. (14) Introduction: Raised intracerebral pressure (ICP) in the setting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common problem and associated with worsening neurological outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage of mannitol over hypertonic saline in the management of ICP in TBI patients. However, there are no published systematic reviews comparing the magnitude and temporal durability in the reduction of ICP between the various concentrations of mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS). Objectives: To determine the temporal reduction in ICP using mannitol, HTS and to compare the efficacy of ICP reduction between the two agents and the effects of varying volumes and concentrations. Methods: The review followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) as the following databases were searched: PubMed (1947 to July 2016), EMBASE (1947 to July 2016), Medline, Cochrane Databases of Systematic Review and Web of Science. The key phrases used in the search were: hypertonic saline, sodium chloride, osmotic diuretic, mannitol, intracranial pressure, traumatic brain injury, head injury. Eligibility criteria for the study included: use of an osmotic diuretic, raised intracranial pressure, adults older than 16, traumatic brain injury. Few studies had a mixed patient population of TBI and subarachnoid hemorrhage. General estimating equations for correlated longitudinal data were used to model the temporal reduction in study averaged ICP, the effect of mannitol versus HTS, and volume and concentration of therapy. Adjustment was made for study methodology. Results: 1349 records were identified using the search strategy. Eighteen randomized controlled trials and 14 cohort studies were used in the systematic review of which 7 studies (4 randomized trials and 3 cohort studies) compared mannitol with HTS and reported mean ICP values suitable for pooled GEE analysis. Univariable ICP reductions were demonstrated at 60 minutes using HTS (p < 0.0001) and mannitol (p = 0.02) but not at 30 or 120 minutes for either treatment. In the multivariable model, a significant ICP reduction was demonstrated over time (p < 0.0001), however there was no significant difference in ICP reduction between the HTS versus the mannitol group (p = 0.92). Neither treatment volume, concentration nor their interaction were modifiers of the effect of either treatment. However, non-randomized studies did modify the treatment effect [ Table 1 ] When all available data from either single treatment (HTS or mannitol) studies or comparison studies were pooled to model the temporal reduction in ICP by individual treatment type, HTS demonstrated a more significant reduction in ICP at 30 (p=0.002), 60 (p<0.0001) and 120 min (p=0.0004) as compared to mannitol at 30 (p=0.002), 60 (p=0.004) and 120 min (p=0.03). [ Figures 1, 2] Using individual treatment models, a significant interaction was seen between the volume and concentration of HTS indicating optimal concentrations of \u2264 10% and volumes of \u2264 250 ml. Conclusion: Both mannitol and HTS are effective at reducing ICP at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after bolus dosing. Although a larger ICP reduction was demonstrated using HTS, this was not statistically significant. A significant interaction was noted between the volume and osmotic concentration using HTS indicating that increasing volumes of low concentration HTS does not result in a greater reduction of ICP.

The timing of MM intervention was noted and compared to fastest potential time in SOC and with AXDX timing. Results: Of 154 cultures assessed by AXDX, 148 resulted in actions by either the microbiologist or medical team; 113 (76%) of which were attributable to data available from AXDX. The most common AXDX attributable intervention was narrowing of antibiotics in 76 (67%) cases, followed by escalation of therapy in 24 (21%) instances or recommending a specialist consult (5%). Compared to SOC, AXDX results were 15.8\u00b112.6h faster to organism ID. Likewise for AST, time-saving was 28.3\u00b111.6h. Given the time saving, it would be possible to save 34 days of broad spectrum therapy by using AXDX for more timely results. For those patients requiring broader therapy, time delay to correct therapy could be decreased by 18h on average. Conclusions: There is significant potential for results from rapid diagnostic panels such as AXDX to support timely antimicrobial prescribing and other management decisions to benefit patients. Next steps include identifying septic patients in the ICU who would benefit from timelier reporting of antimicrobial susceptibility.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials and Methods:"}, {"text": "Introduction: Risk-stratification of patients with suspected infection is important.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Materials and Methods:"}, {"text": "Existing prognostic tools (such as SIRS and qSOFA criteria) lack accuracy in older patients with suspected infection. Therefore, new methods for accurate outcome prognostication in older people with suspected infection are needed. Frailty, a syndrome based on accumulation of age-and disease-related deficits, is associated with vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. However, the association of frailty with adverse outcomes among older patients with suspected infection is poorly described. Introduction: Traumatic injuries are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In trauma patients, cell and tissue death can result from inflammation or injury. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has anti-fibrinolytic and pro-coagulant effects and can be released by neutrophils via NETosis in response to infection, sterile inflammation, and hypoxia or by processes like necrosis. Previously, cfDNA has been noted to be elevated and prognostic in sepsis. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury, high levels of cfDNA were associated with an increased risk of death. Protein C (PC) is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits coagulation in the microcirculation. Low PC levels are associated with increased risk of death in sepsis. Objective: to determine if cfDNA or PC, previously shown to be capable of discriminating between survivors and non-survivors in sepsis, had prognostic utility in trauma patients. Methods: Patient plasma samples were obtained from a combination of two prospective observational cohort studies: DYNAMICS (NCT0135504) and ENPOLY. Clinical data and plasma samples were obtained on admission, daily for the first week, and then weekly thereafter. Levels of cfDNA, PC, and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured in the plasma using established laboratory protocols. Using 293XL-hTLR9 reporter cells, we determined the levels of NF-kB activation by these cells in response to cfDNA from the ENPOLY samples at all time points. Results: A total of 77 trauma patients were included (n=38 from DYNAMICS and n=39 from ENPOLY). The median age was 49 years; 27.3% were female. Mortality was 16.9% at 28 days. Levels of cfDNA were elevated compared to healthy values in our patient population, but not significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. PC levels were reduced in our population compared to normal levels but did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Platelet count on admission was significantly lower in non-survivors than survivors (p< 0.01) suggesting an underlying consumptive process. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for predicting mortality are shown in Table 1 . When plasma samples were added with 293XL-hTLR9 reporter cells, there was no production of SEAP at any time point, indicating no NF-kB activation and the cfDNA in trauma samples is not bacterial in origin. When MPO levels were quantified as a surrogate marker of NETosis, there was no correlation to cfDNA levels (r= -0.192, p = 0.115); however, a positive correlation existed between MPO and cfDNA in a comparison group of septic patients (n=52) from the DYNAMICS study (r=0.424, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Levels of cfDNA and PC are abnormal in multiple critical conditions such as sepsis and trauma. However, variation in the source of cfDNA between septic and trauma patients may account for differences in prognostic utility. In trauma patients, future studies into dysregulation of platelet production and function may prove useful for improving survival.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2630, "end": 2637, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Materials and Methods:"}, {"text": "Alabdrab Background: Pulmonary embolism is a difficult diagnosis, with potentially serious consequences, but computed tomographic pulmonary angiography is also not without complications.

We then compared this to the incidence of pulmonary embolism and the frequency of its complications in the same cohort (mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, and hemorrhage from thrombolysis), as well as the pulmonary embolism cases that could have been missed if computed tomography was only performed for high risk patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Complications of Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography to Rule Out Pulmonary Embolism in a Tertiary Care Cancer & Neuroscience Center"}, {"text": "We analyzed a sample of 134 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department between March 2014 and December 2017. We found a 13.4% incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (18/134 patients). None of them required dialysis & nobody developed allergic reactions. Lifetime risk of cancer attributable to this computed tomography exposure was estimated to increase by 0.147% & risk of death by 0.071%. The incidence of confirmed pulmonary embolism in the same sample was 20.1% (27/134 patients), 3 of them died because of pulmonary embolism (representing 11.1% from patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism). 11.2% required mechanical ventilation (15/134 patients), and 5.2% required vasopressors (7/134 patients). Only 1 patient re-quired thrombolytic therapy (0.7%). He did not develop hemorrhage after treatment. Compared to the 11.1% mortality rate of treated cases, the historical mortality rate of undiagnosed and untreated cases has been reported between 26-30%. If computed tomography was restricted to high clinical risk cases, we could have missed 55% of pulmonary embolism cases, resulting in a potential mortality increase from 11.1% to 20.2%. Conclusion: The incidence of pulmonary embolism and its complications in this patient population was higher and more serious than the incidence of computed tomography complications. Therefore, we would still recommend maintaining a low threshold of obtaining a computed tomography pulmonary angiography in this patient population. Introduction: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a complex and expensive form of life-sustaining therapy, reserved for our most acutely ill patients. While a number of randomized trials have evaluated the optimal timing to start RRT among critically ill patients in the ICU, there has been a paucity of trials providing guidance on when and under what circumstances to ideally liberate a patient from RRT. 1, 2, 3 Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence on clinical and biochemical markers that predict renal recovery and successful liberation from acute RRT among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was developed in consultation with a research librarian and independently peer-reviewed by a second librarian. Electronic databases (Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Wiley Cochrane Library) were searched, as were selected grey literature sources. Our search strategy focused on concepts related to RRT (i.e., intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)); intensive care medicine (i.e., involving any intensive care unit (ICU) setting) and discontinuation of therapy (i.e., either clinical, physiological and biochemical parameters of weaning acute RRT). Citation screening, selection, quality assessment and data abstraction were performed in duplicate. Studies were pooled in statistical meta-analysis when deemed sufficiently clinically homogenous, with sensitivities and specificities pooled simultaneously using a hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curve (HSROC) and bi-variate analysis. Results: Our search yielded 3031 results, of which 20 studies fulfilled eligibility; 18 cohort studies and 2 case control studies, evaluating a total of 3650 patients ( Figure 1 ). Studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Score (NOS). The mean NOS score was 7 (range 4-9) and the majority of studies were of high quality (n=16, 80%) with 4 studies rated as moderate quality (20%). There were no studies identified as being poor quality. The most commonly identified parameter was urine output, identified in 9 studies (45%), followed by serum Cystatin C, which was identified in 3 studies (15%). Other identified biomarkers included kinetic eGFR, plasma NGAL, urine urea, creatinine clearance (2-and 24-hour), NT-proBNP and multivariate models including baseline parameters, each identified in a single instance. However, all identified parameters exhibited significant heterogeneity between studies. Conclusion: 20 studies were identified evaluating clinical and biochemical parameters of weaning RRT in critically ill patients with AKI. Urine output and serum cystatin C were the most commonly identified parameters, although definitions and cutoff values were heterogenous between studies. Further study is required to better define cutoffs and clarify the role of various biomarkers and elucidate accurate predictive models of RRT weaning in the critically ill patient population. Future work will involve quantitative analysis of the various identified weaning parameters. Students were given the opportunity to fill out a 10 item self-report questionnaire anonymously.

We wished to determine the potential of intra-peritoneal Ed-M\u0278 delivery in a rodent polymicrobial abdominal sepsis. Methods: Directed differentiation of murine PSCs was used to produce expandable Ed-M\u0278 conditioned to a 'LPM-peritoneal-like' phenotype with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Polymicrobial sepsis was developed in rats by instilling cecal slurry intraperitoneally (i.p., 0.5g/kg). Ed-M\u0278 (10x10^6 cells/kg) or vehicle (PBS) were given i.p. to the rats 4h later and the animals were monitored for 48 or 72 hours. Lung functional parameters, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) and major organs were collected for infiltration and bacterial count assessment. Macrophages (Mf) and neutrophils (Nf) were isolated from the peritoneum of septic animals using Ficoll gradient and their phagocytic function (using serum opsonized zymosan), activation state, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as Mf efferocytosis determined by confocal microscopy. Nf apoptotic markers were assessed by Western blot analysis. Results: Ed-M\u0278 treatment significantly attenuated the increase in alveolar and peritoneal white blood cell and neutrophil infiltration induced following abdominal fecal sepsis. Ed-M\u0278-treated rats cleared bacteria more efficiently, with lower bacterial counts (CFU/mL in the lung, liver & spleen compared to vehicle-treated animals). Peritoneal M\u0278 isolated from septic rats treated with Ed-M\u0278 showed better attachment, more effective phagocytosis and higher ROS production, compared to M\u0278's from vehicle treated animals. In contrast, peritoneal Nf isolated from septic rats treated with vehicle were more active and produced more ROS than Nf isolated from septic rats treated with Ed-M\u0278. Apoptotic markers (Caspase-3 and Bax) were significantly more expressed in PLF Nf from Ed-M\u0278 treated than vehicle treated septic rats 72h after sepsis induction. That indicates prolonged life span of PLF Nf from PBS-treated rats, as another sign of more severe sepsis 4 in this animal group. Conclusions: Intra-peritoneal Ed-Mf therapy attenuated the severity of fecal sepsis, and reduced bacterial load, and may have therapeutic potential for systemic sepsis.

Objective: To explore the feasibility and safety of delivering advanced medical care to patients in a simulated Ebola treatment unit. The objective of the pilot study was to develop a protocol of simulated advanced supportive care under two climatic conditions: 'hot'(35 0 C, 60% humidity); 'cool' (20 0 C, 20% humidity). Methods: Participants were healthcare workers; they received an information package and instructional videos of the study procedures and completed a pre-study medical fitness checklist. Study procedures included donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), inserting a peripheral venous catheter (PIV) and a mid-line arm venous catheter (mid-line catheter), and endotracheal intubation. Participants were assigned to either hot or cool conditions and performed tasks on mannequins. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin temperature, and blood pressure (BP) monitors were attached to each participant. Weight, height, and baseline and post-simulation vital signs were measured. Task feasibility was measured using a task specific checklist, participants' task completion times, and percentages of tasks completed. Safety was assessed by vital signs measurements, number of PPE breaches, and health-concerning and near-miss incidents. Health-concerning threshold values for simulation cessation were HR >85% of maximum HR or <40 beats/minute, systolic BP <90 mmHg or a drop >40 mmHg below baseline, a self-rated thermal comfort scale of \u226512 (from 1, so cold that I am helpless to 13, so hot I am sick and nauseated), or any report of feeling unwell.

The McNemar's test was used to evaluate whether altering specific clinical variables changed physician willingness to recommend tracheostomy, and its impact on preferred timing (\u2264 3 weeks or > 3 weeks of MV). Results: Overall response rate was 165/396 (42%). We received at least 1 response all 16 Canadian tertiary-care academic hospitals performing pediatric tracheostomy. Table 1 shows that 47/121 (38.8%), 23/93 (24.7%) and 40/87 (46.0%) of respondents would recommend tracheostomy at or before 3 weeks of MV for case 1, 2 and 3, at baseline respectively; the difference between case 2 and 3 was statistically significant (p < 0.001). As shown in Figure 1 only two of 16 clinical variables -subglottic stenosis (OR 6.5 95% CI 1.47-59.33), and bilateral vocal paralysis (OR 5.33, 95% CI 1.53-28.56) -significantly increased the likelihood of ever recommending tracheostomy, in case 1, and none in cases 2 and 3. Far more variables were associated with a decreased likelihood of ever recommending tracheostomy for all 3 cases , the strongest of which was with life limiting condition (Case 1, OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.17, Case 2 OR 0.03 95% CI 0.0-0.1, Case 3 OR 0.05 95% CI 0.01-0.2). The association between variables and preferred timing of tracheostomy can be seen in figure 2 . Again, in case 1 a strong association was found between recommendation for earlier tracheostomy and subglottic stenosis (OR 31 95% CI 5.7-1263.43) or bilateral vocal cord paralysis (OR 16, 95% CI 4.08-137.79). Conclusion: A significant majority of physicians appear reluctant to recommend tracheostomy for children requiring PMV. Further, there were only a small number of factors that increased the likelihood of recommending tracheostomy at \u2264 3 weeks of MV.

It is usually seen as an overt, active, extreme, conflict driven phenomenon, 1 and not typically thought of as being associated with health care. There is however a more subtle form of dehumanization called infrahumanization that can occur outside conflict situations. Infrahumanization can occur whenever groups identify others as being outside their cohort and has been shown to occur in medical settings. 2,3 Capozza found that physicians and nurses caring for oncology patients perceived their own professional group as possessing more uniquely human traits than the patient group. 2 A study of a variety of nursing showed that denial of uniquely human traits (reasoning, rationality, morality and intellectual ability) to patients was associated with lower levels of stress among nurses with high levels of organizational and affective commitment, suggesting that infrahumanization is a subconscious coping strategy to reduce the emotional burden of caring for patients. 3 Those suffering from critical illness are particularly vulnerable to this unintentional dehumanization. In an effort to refocus care of the critically ill to a more person-centered lens, several initiatives have been advocated (Figure 1 ), including diaries, liberal visitation policies, involvement of relatives in basic patient care and opportunities for relatives to be present during resuscitation. 4, 5, 6 There seems to be a conflict between what feels intuitively right (to humanize patients) and what health care professionals do to protect themselves against burnout and emotional burden (dehumanize patients). Equally important is what effect these interventions may have on family members.

The main quantitative measure was monthly enrolment rate. Secondary measures included the number of staff who enrolled patients for the first time, the number of compassionate acts per patient enrolled, and the financial cost of each act of compassion. To understand experience during implementation, seven semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders were conducted with six clinicians who implemented the 3 Wishes Project for their patient and one clinician who was involved in the initial environmental scan. Quantitative data were analyzed using appropriate statistical process control while qualitative data were analyzed in triplicate using a qualitative descriptive approach. Results: By the end of the pilot phase, 14 patients were enrolled and 61 wishes were implemented. 13.7% of dying patients were enrolled monthly. In addition, 9 clinicians enrolled a patient for the first time into the 3 Wishes Project. 1.5 clinicians per month enrolled a patient for the first time and 4.6 acts of compassion were performed per patient without additional financial cost. Interviews identified four facilitators: a shared vision for sparking change, research team integration with frontline staff, a collaborative learning environment, and available resources for staff to implement acts of compassion. Two barriers identified were: the differential manifestation of the project within different sub-cultures of the ICU, and the unclear process to fulfill an act of compassion.

Methods: Blood monocytes, isolated from healthy donors and septic patients (in first 48h of sepsis) were differentiated into M\u0278 and exposed to human umbilical cord (hUC) MSCs (obtained from Tissue Regeneration Therapeutics\u00ae, Toronto) in transwell plates for 48h. M\u0278 phagocytosis was assessed using serum opsonized zymozan (SOZ) while their killing capabilities were tested using live E. coli. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. M\u0278 were also isolated from peritoneal fluid (PLF) of septic rats challenged with cecal slurry (1g/kg, i.p.) 48h earlier, that been treated with UC-MSCs (10 mill/kg, i.v.) or placebo 4h after sepsis induction. Inflammation and bacterial clearance were assessed in PLF, BAL, and organs of the septic animals. Results: Phagocytic efficacy and bacterial killing capacities were significantly increased in M\u0278 from both healthy donors and septic patients co-cultured with UC-MSCs than in control M\u0278. M\u0278 exposed to MSCs expressed more HO-1, an enzyme with anti-inflammatory and bactericidal properties. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from animals subjected to abdominal fecal demonstrated greater phagocytosis of SOZ when taken from UC-MSC treated vs. vehicle treated animals. Macrophages also expressed more HO-1. The direct HO-1 inducer Hemin increased macrophage phagocytosis from vehicle but not from UC-MSC treated animals. In contrast, the HO-1 antagonist ZnPP decreased phagocytosis in M\u0278 from UC-MSC treated animals to the levels seen in macrophages from vehicle treated animals. The HO-1 increase in M\u0278 was dependent on pro-resolvin mediators secreted by UC-MSCs, specifically PGE2 and Lipoxin A4. Septic animals cleared bacteria and recovered faster, if treated with UC-MSCs. Conclusions: UC-MSCs are promising tool for sepsis treatment. UC-MSCs enhance macrophage phagocytosis and increase bacterial clearance, in part, via a mechanism involving UC-MSC induced HO-1 expression in macrophages. Methods: In 2016 we employed a quantitative social network design and sent surveys to all five Regional Medical Leads (RMLs) and all 52 Hospital Donation Physicians (HDPs) in Ontario to better understand their roles, practice context, and to map their social networks. Social network analysis was performed with raw survey data with NVIVO software to produce a map of Ontario's physician leadership model as well as individual maps for each hospital-based physician. Results: The social network maps included a sociogram of the entire network as well as maps comparing the five RML peer learning networks (i.e., RML connectivity to HDPs at the hospital level). We were able to illustrate the key local opinion leaders / social influencers at each of the hospitals. Also, a central part of the survey was to ascertain the current state of the HDP social network in terms of knowledge sharing and support. Many respondents viewed the implementation physician leadership and engagement roles as central facilitators of TGLNs vision in Ontario. At the same time, respondents felt that the implementation of the roles was problematic in that these roles were not clearly defined nor locally communicated to hospitals at the outset. HDPs provided varied answers as to what they perceived their role to be, the most frequently described role was to monitor performance/quality improvement. Conclusion: Social network mapping of the physician leadership model provides a better understanding of the functioning, and ongoing peer learning that occurs within the network.

Methods: A core component of the 3 Wishes Project is an invitation for nurses, physicians, physiotherapists and respiratory therapists-both staff and trainees alike-to write a few words to bereaved family members in a sympathy card, mailed 1-2 weeks after each death. For this analysis, we searched a qualitative database of 200 clinician and family interview transcripts. Data related to sympathy cards were independently coded by 2 investigators using conventional content analysis and a list of codes was developed by consensus. Results: We identified 27 transcripts from individual interviews (n=14 family members, n=11 clinicians) and 2 focus groups (n=8 clinicians) in which sympathy cards sent by the 3 Wishes Program were discussed in 3 participating centers (SJH, VGH, UCLA). In 16 (59.3%) transcripts, participants spontaneously discussed sympathy cards. In 11 (40.7%) transcripts, participants were explicitly asked to reflect on their experiences sending or receiving sympathy cards. Family members felt deeply touched by personalized messages in the cards and saw them as a heartfelt act of compassion by the ICU team. The cards were a welcome surprise and offered an appreciated connection to clinicians with whom they had a relationship. Families reported feeling warmly remembered and they were eager to tell their relatives, friends and other hospital staff about receiving the card. Clinicians viewed the cards as an opportunity to offer expressions of their shared humanity with families, reminding them that they and their loved one were not forgotten. Most staff were keen to write a few words to families of patients they cared for who they knew well enough to authentically express their sorrow. While some staff preferred to pen a message only if they directly cared for the patient, others were motivated to offer sentiments of condolence if they had a brief interaction with the patient or knew them indirectly through seeing their family in the ICU. Taking the time to discuss memories of a deceased patient in the company of a colleague offered an opportunity for reminiscing and closure. A unifying concept was that both family members and clinicians experienced sympathy cards as an important continuation of care extended to family members of deceased ICU patients. Sympathy cards symbolized a special post-mortem connection for both parties. Conclusions: Family members found sympathy cards to be a meaningful, compassionate gesture by the ICU team. Inviting staff who cared for deceased patients to offer personalized condolences in a card mailed to bereaved family members may foster sincere, valued expressions of sympathy when individualized and unstructured, as contextualized in the 3 Wishes Program. Conclusions: Pre-arrest factors associated with reduced odds of survival to discharge include existing comorbidities (e.g. active malignancy, chronic kidney disease), and admission diagnosis of sepsis, while intra-arrest factors include unwitnessed arrest, unmonitored arrest, non-shockable rhythm, arrest outside of daytime hours, and intubation during arrest.

Introduction: A presumed consent model of organ donation assumes all people of a defined geographic area consent for deceased organ donation unless they have expressed otherwise. Various forms of presumed consent exist 1 that are often implemented to increase donation rates, but have yielded mixed results [2] [3] [4] . Literature reviews on the topic suggest that a presumed consent model is unlikely to increase donation rates unless done in a transparent manner with broad support of the public and healthcare professionals 2, 5 Introduction: IMGs play an integral part in many health care systems worldwide. 1 When they pursue clinical training in a different country, IMGs face the need to adapt to an unfamiliar working environment. 2, 3 The practice of critical care is complex, time-sensitive and highly dependent on inter-disciplinary teamwork. In fact, effective team work has been tied to better ICU patient outcomes. 4 Understanding the \"rules of the game\" within an ICU team may represent a unique challenge for IMGs starting a critical care fellowship. The inability or delayed ability to adapt to their new training environment may be problematic for the trainees and for patient care.

More specifically, this project explores: 1) IMG fellows' perceptions of their role within the multiprofessional ICU team; 2) challenges encountered by IMG fellows as they transition into their new professional role; 3) strategies used by IMG fellows to overcome these challenges. We explored how known theories on professional transition apply to the ICU environment with the ultimate goal of developing evidence-informed initiatives to support IMG fellows and ICU teams during the early transition period in the fellowship. Methods: In this qualitative single center study, we conducted 16 individual interviews with IMG fellows who were enrolled in the adult critical care fellowship program of the University of Toronto. Fellow's perceptions of their role and transition within the ICU team were explored and iteratively analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory approach, including purposive sampling, inductive coding, constant comparison and inter-disciplinary theoretical construction of a model. Results: Participants came from Europe, Central/South America, North America, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. Our analysis revealed that most of the participants had a limited understanding of the role of a fellow. For many fellows, this uncertainty translated into an initial lack of confidence in their ability to fulfill their role. The North American model of multidisciplinary ICU team (composition and roles) was perceived as a huge challenge. As they tried to work within the ICU team, participants reported experiencing many losses: autonomy, appreciation, efficiency, skills, and personal work standards. Fellows maneuvered this period of transition by relying on honed clinical skills, building trust with ICU team members, changing attitudes towards teamwork, or seeking social support. Others described a period of resistance where they actively challenged the system, the team or their colleagues. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings show that IMGs who have to transition into the role of a fellow within an inter-disciplinary ICU team encounter unique challenges. Uncertainties experienced at the beginning of the fellowship lead to a dynamic process of collapse and re-construction of their professional identity.

Further, we examined the impact of these factors on hospital length of stay (LOS) as well as the total financial cost per hospitalization. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the HCUP NIS database from years 2005-2014. To select our subpopulation, the following inclusion criteria were applied: a) over the age of 18 years; b) assigned a diagnosis of cirrhosis (International Classification of Diseases 9th edition [ICD-9] code 571) and c) assigned an ICD-9 procedure code for mechanical ventilation (96.7). Multiple regression was used to assess the association between specific patient factors on in-hospital mortality, LOS and total hospital charges while adjusting for age, sex, race, Charlson comorbidity category, primary payer source, median income in the patient's residential area, elective versus emergency admission, location, size, and teaching status. Conclusions: There are several comorbidities associated with increased mortality amongst mechanically ventilated cirrhotic patients, including hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, and renal failure. Procedures on this high-risk population were generally associated with improved mortality rates but significantly longer hospital stays and higher financial costs. Our results reinforce the notion that mechanically ventilated cirrhotics are a high-risk and expensive population with generally poor outcomes. Patients with impaired renal function and suspected sepsis should be treated carefully as they have an even greater risk of in-hospital mortality.

Introduction: Despite an increasing literature suggesting the poor performance of VAP as a quality measure of the care of mechanically-ventilated patients (), the only Accreditation Canada standard pertaining specifically to these patients relates to VAP prevention and treatment. The concept of Ventilator-Associated Event (VAE), introduced by the CDC/NHSN as a more suitable measurement in the evaluation of clinical care and outcome in these patients. Objective: We wished to 1) test the hypothesis that VAE identification adds value to current VAP surveillance data in a mixed med-surg ICU population, 2) to extrapolate from these data the number of potentially-missed VAEs during this time period. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of ICU patients previously identified with VAP between January 2009 and September 2016 and applied the CDC/NHSN criteria for VAE occurring 7 days before or after their designated VAP date. Data were merged into a preexisting ICU database. We first compared clinical/outcome data between patients intubated/ventilated (I/V) \u2264 2days (d) with those where and those I/V >2d (Table 1) . We then compared the same parameters for 1) VAP cases with those patients without VAP but similarly I/V >2d, as well as 2) VAP cases based on whether they also met VAE criteria (Table 2 ). Finally, we compared our data with those from a similar published Canadian ICU population in order to estimate the number of \"missed\" cases of VAE in our population. Results: Of 7919 ICU admissions, 1758 (22%) were I/V >2d, of which 143 cases (8%) of VAP were identified; 47/143 (33%) had coexisting VAE (VAC 36%, iVAC 30%, \"VAE-VAP\" 34%). Patients I/V >2d comprised a sicker, older population than those I/V \u2264 2d (Table 1) with differences in case mix and pre-ICU origin, increased LOS and mortality (icu & hosp), prop of ICU/hosp-days, ventilator utilization and ICU readmission. Patients with VAP showed differences in case mix and pre-ICU origin when compared those without VAP (Table 2) , as well as increased LOS (icu & hosp), % of ICU/hospital-days, % of admissions with LOSicu>7d and utilization of ventilator days. VAP patients with coexisting VAE were similar to those without VAE, except for a larger number of transfers to another ICU/institution. This may explain the higher % of ICU/hospital-days and the trend towards decreased ICU readmission rate and hospital LOS. NB only 1/3 of VAE patients had concurrent VAE-derived VAP Comparison with VAP and VAE data from a similar Canadian ICU population showed a similar distribution of ventilator-related parameters. We estimated from this comparison that at least 117 cases of VAE were missed by virtue of not having concurrent VAP identification.

It is a safe and feasible intervention in intensive care units (ICU) (Pires-Neto, 2013) despite increasing oxygen consumption in mechanically ventilated patients(Savi, 2010). However, while it can benefit patients by preserving muscle mass and strength(Hickmann, 2018), it can potentially lead to impaired distal organ perfusion. Furthermore, the effective dose of PC may vary between patients. The effect of PC on distal organ perfusion, and variation in patient responses to differing intensities of passive exercise remains unknown. These factors are critical to establishing the safety and appropriate dosage of PC in individual critically ill patients during the acute phase of their illness. Objectives: 1) To observe the effect of PC on global hemodynamics, cerebral blood flow, and heart function in septic patients. 2) To observe the optimal intensity of PC in patients.Methods: We used Finapres\u00ae NOVA and intravenous monitoring, transcranial Doppler, and speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure global hemodynamics, middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv, an indicator of cerebral blood flow) and cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction [EF] and global longitudinal strain [GLS]) during incremental increases of in-bed PC intensity in septic patients. The protocol started and ended with 5 minutes of baseline measurements at rest. PC intensity was progressively increased from 5 to 55 rotations per minute (RPM) in 10 RPM increments, with each experimental stage lasting 5 minutes.

In some centres, all DKA patients are admitted to the ICU, while in others, these patients are admitted to step-down units, where close monitoring can still be provided. Given the limited availability of ICU beds, the effectiveness of such step-down units must be evaluated. Objectives: We sought to compare the outcomes and costs of adult DKA patients admitted to an ICU against those admitted to a step-down unit. Methods: We utilized prospectively collected registry data gathered from 2011-2016 at two hospitals in Ottawa, ON. We included consecutive patients admitted to hospital, and who met diagnostic criteria for DKA (as defined by the American Diabetes Association). Patients were either admitted to the ICU, or a step-down unit, which has a nurse-to-patient ratio of 2:1, but does not have capability for mechanical ventilation or administration of vasoactive agents.

EOL care in the ICU includes providing grieving patients and families with medical, psychological, and spiritual support, as well as supporting the patient or family's wishes for organ donation when death is a probable or expected outcome. To prepare future critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to provide this care, training programs should include teaching on EOL care as part of their formal curricula. Objectives: The objective of the ESPRIT Study (End of Life Skills & Professionalism for Critical Care Residents in Training) was to conduct a cross-sectional survey of Canadian CCM residents and program directors to describe and analyze current educational practices about EOL care. Methods: We identified survey topics and items following a focused literature review related to each critical care national objective of training. We then created questions about each topic to address 3 domains of interest: 1) curricular content & evaluation methods, 2) resident's preparedness to meet these objectives, and 3) how learning could be improved. We formatted a self-administered instrument tailored to each respondent group, performed pilot testing for each instrument, and used a Clinical Sensibility Questionnaire to test our resident survey instrument. We then distributed the ESPRIT Survey to all CCM residents and program directors across the 13 CCM programs in Canada. Results: Our national response rate was 82% (n=78) for the resident survey and 92% (n=12) for the program director survey.

Nationally, 4,492 people were on Canada's organ transplant waitlists in 2016. Unfortunately, 260 patients on waitlists that same year died before receiving transplants. The majority of organ donors are deceased donors, donating through either neurologically deceased donation or controlled donation after cardiac death. Since both of these donation categories involve life-sustaining therapy, deceased donor management is primarily the purview of the intensive care clinician. In 2016, Canada had a deceased donation rate of 20.1 per million population, ranking 19th among 68 countries.

In addition to the need for further research, however, there is also a paucity of tools to help clinicians provide optimal donor care.

Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) respond to hospitalized patients with deterioration, and help determine subsequent management, including Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission.

Objectives: We sought to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of the Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS) for prediction of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission among hospitalized patients. The prognostic accuracy of HEWS was compared to the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2). We secondarily evaluated the accuracy of HEWS in a subgroup of RRT patients with suspected infection. Methods: We utilized prospectively collected registry data (2012-2016) from two hospitals in Ottawa, Ontario. Consecutive hospitalized adult patients assessed by the RRT were included. Vital signs and laboratory values were collected at the time of RRT assessment. Patients were followed to the point of in-hospital death or hospital discharge. 'Suspected infection' was defined as concomitant administration of antibiotics and sampling of body fluid cultures. The Number Needed to Examine (NNE) was calculated, which indicates the number of patients that need to be evaluated in order to detect one patient who will die in-hospital, and is an indirect measure of the cost-effectiveness of each alert.Results: 5,995 patients were included in analysis, of whom 1,833 (30.6%) died inhospital. 1,708 patients (28.5%) met criteria for 'suspected infection'. A HEWS above the low-risk threshold (\u2265 3) had a sensitivity of 90.8% (95% CI: 89.4-92.1) and specificity of 32.4% (95% CI: 31.0-33.9) for in-hospital mortality, with a NNE of 2.7 (95% CI: 2.6-2.8). A HEWS above the moderate-risk threshold (\u2265 5) had a sensitivity of 73.4% (95% CI: 71.3-75.4) and specificity of 60.7% (95% CI: 59.2-62.2) for in-hospital mortality, with a NNE of 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1-2.3). Finally, a high-risk HEWS (\u2265 9) had a sensitivity of 33.9% (95% CI: 31.8-36.2) and specificity of 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3-99.7) for in-hospital mortality, with a NNE of 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0-1.1). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for mortality was 0.743 (95% CI: 0.730-0.757) for HEWS, and 0.754 (95% CI: 0.733-0.782) for NEWS2. Among patients with suspected infection, a HEWS \u2265 3 had a sensitivity of 91.2% (88.6-93.4) and specificity of 33.3 (95% CI 30.6-36.1) for in-hospital mortality, with a NNE of 2.5 (95% CI: 2.4-2.5).

This external application of the HEWS suggests that it may be a valuable tool in the risk-stratification of hospitalized patients with acute deterioration.

The current opinion of Canadian intensive care physicians towards presumed consent for organ donation is unknown. The last reported national survey of healthcare workers (including non-physicians) on the topic was published in 2006 6 , with 59% somewhat or strongly supportive of a presumed consent model. Objective: Survey practicing adult and pediatric intensive care physicians on their attitudes towards a presumed consent model for deceased organ donation. Presumed consent questions were embedded in a larger survey on deceased donation practices in Canada. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Canadian intensive care physicians. We followed a standardized approach for design and conduct of selfadministered surveys 7 , including item generation and reduction using modified Delphi methods, survey validation for clarity, redundancy and comprehensiveness, and testretest reliability assessments. Our sampling frame included all intensivists practicing in an institution that may care for potential organ donors. Intensivists were identified by merging lists obtained in collaboration with Canadian Blood Services, the Canadian Critical Care Society and manual searches from publicly available sources (e.g. hospital websites). The survey was administered using an online platform (LimesurveyTM) from February 26 to March 26, 2018 with two e-mail reminders. Survey responses are reported using descriptive statistics. Results: 550 potential respondents were identified, of which 21 did not meet inclusion criteria and 1 participant declined consent. The response rate was 49.7% (263/529) and the completion rate 89.4% (235/263). Overall, 95.7% of respondents had a mostly positive or positive general opinion regarding organ donation in general. When asked if they would be in favor of a change towards a presumed consent model, 62.2% agreed or strongly agreed, 18.7% were neutral and 20% disagreed or strongly disagreed. 77% stated they believe a presumed consent model would increase organ donation rates, 25% expressed that such a model would increase the likelihood that they would approach a family to discuss organ donation. Conclusion: In our survey, a majority expressed support for a presumed consent model. Though not asked in exactly the same manner or of the same population, the rate of support for presumed consent seems largely stable since a 2006 survey(6). A larger majority believed that a presumed consent model would increase organ donation rates, even though most respondents did not indicate they would be more likely to approach families and surrogates of patients who are potential donors. Further research is required to better understand attitudes and knowledge of if and how a presumed consent model should be implemented in Canada.The Cost Effectiveness of Mechanical Ventilation Using PAV+ Mode in CanadaSaunders, Rhodri 1 ; Bosma, Karen 2,3 1 Health Economics, Coreva Scientific, Freiburg, Germany 2 Associate Professor of Medicine, Critical Care Medicine and Respirology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada 3 Critical Care, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, CanadaBackground: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is an integral but expensive part of the intensive care unit (ICU). Events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheotomy can further increase care costs. Optimizing MV provision could result in substantial cost savings and improved patient outcomes. Here, the health and cost outcomes of proportional assist ventilation plus (PAV+) mode are compared with pressure support ventilation (PSV), incorporating recent data including a randomizedcontrolled trial 1 , a meta-analysis 2 , and an ICU costing study 3 published by Canadian institutions in 2018. Methods: Data from clinical studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were used to inform event rates and patient risk in a computational model of a patient's care pathway once initiated on MV. Care settings include the ICU, general ward, and home. The model estimates patient outcomes (time on MV, days in ICU, days in hospital, and hospital discharge) and safety events, including the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony >10%, tracheotomy, VAP, nosocomial infections, spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure, and post-liberation hypoxemia. In-hospital and post-discharge mortality were taken from rates in peer-reviewed literature up to 3 years and from Canadian life tables thereafter. Patients, mean 65 years and 40% female, are on MV until a successful SBT and liberation. Time on MV is influenced by asynchrony >10% and VAP. MV is either PSV or PAV+ mode, with differences between these interventions derived from the weighted mean outcomes of 6 RCTs 4-9 . PAV+ mode was associated with less asynchrony, shorter time on MV (-1.62) and in the ICU, but longer time in hospital. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) used EQ-5D utilities. All event costs are expressed in 2017 CAD. The model's time horizon runs from 1-40 years with cost and health outcomes after the first year discounted at 1.5% per annum. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) provides estimates of outcome significance at the 95% level. Results: The first-year cost of care was $54,253 with PAV+, a saving of $6,200 compared with PSV ($60,452). Outcomes reflected lower resource use with PAV+ mode. Of PAV+ patients, 0.28 QALYs were accumulated with 79% alive at the year end. For PSV, the respective values were 0.25 QALYs and 69% alive. Benefits were reduced mean time on MV (6.2 days) compared with PSV (8.4 days) and a lower rate of VAP. The 40 year cost of care ($160,543) was higher with PAV+ mode than with PSV ($153,610). Improvements in QALYs (+0.96) and life expectancy (+1.57 years) were identified with PAV+ mode. Superior to PSV after 1-year, PAV+ was likely (100%) to be considered cost-effective versus PSV at 40 years given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. PSA showed that increases in QALYs with PAV+ mode were significant, but differences in costs were not. The mean cost per QALY gained was $7,380 (median $4,955). Results did not differ substantially if PAV+ mode had no impact on asynchrony, meta-analysis informed clinical effectiveness, or different cost sources were used. If future care costs were excluded, PAV+ mode was superior to PSV. Cost and outcomes drivers were time on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU.Conclusions: Under modelled conditions, PAV+ mode increased patient quality of life and life expectancy. In the early years, healthcare costs decreased with use of PAV+ mode. Increased life expectancy led to higher long-term costs. transition of International Medical Graduate (IMG) fellows into the ICU Team: Identity Gain or Loss?

The average rating was 4.4 (SD 0.74) (very good) on a 1-5 scale; 52% of ratings were 5 (excellent). Using a Jonckheere-Terpstra test, it was determined that evaluation ratings are improving over time (p = 0.01). Workshop attendee comments provided positive feedback on the diversity of topics and speakers. RCs reported networking opportunities, interactive discussions and learning from more experienced RCs as the most valued aspects of the workshops. Areas for improvement included more time for group discussion and interactive sessions. Suggestions for future workshop content focused on practical day-to-day activities such as grant writing, budget preparation, consent and co-enrolment, regulatory requirements, time management, research methodology and increasing productivity. Conclusions: The Canadian Critical Care Research Coordinators have broad learning needs. Professional growth and development is highly valued.

A systematic review of postoperative handover identified an association between the quality of patient handover and patient harm 1 . One strategy to improve handover and prevent adverse events is the application of checklists to standardize communication and minimize omissions 2 . Our academic centre recently implemented a standardized handover tool for the transfer of postoperative cardiac surgery patients to the CVICU. Objectives: To assess completion of a novel handover tool 6-months postimplementation, and elicit attitudes and perceptions of anesthesiologists and members of the CVICU team about perioperative patient handover. Methods: Ethics review was completed via the local REB. Chart review began 6months post-implementation of the handover tool and included 373 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery over a 3-month period. Completion of the 59 parameters on the handover tool was assessed for adherence, and compared to the anesthetic record and preoperative investigations to assess for quality and accuracy of information. Using an online database, a self-administered survey was created regarding perioperative handover of CVICU patients. The survey was pilot tested and broadly disseminated to all cardiac anesthesiologists as well as healthcare professionals working in the CVICU. Questions were designed using a 5-point Likert scale with opportunity for free text commentary. Results: 357 (96%) of the charts reviewed included a copy of the handover tool. The parameters most frequently completed (>80% of charts) included medical history, airway management, arterial lines, cardiac bypass duration, drug dosing, and the transferring anesthesiologist's name. Documentation regarding pacing, recent bloodwork, central lines, peripheral IVs, and time of transfer were completed in less than 80% of charts. The response rate to the survey was 111 of 154 stakeholders (72%). 72% of respondents felt the handover tool improved the handover process and 62% felt it improved handover efficiency. No respondents felt the tool worsened handover. The majority felt the tool improved the transfer of important details of intraoperative care. The tool also enhanced verbal communication by anesthesiology trainees, standardized handover among anesthesia providers, and allowed access to important perioperative details after handover was completed. Barriers to success of the handover tool included a lack of awareness of its existence and nominal completion. Barriers to the effectiveness of overall patient transition included: insufficient clearance of physical space during patient transfer, lack of attendance of the cardiac surgeon and ICU attending during handover, and difficulty hearing verbal handover at the bedside. Conclusions: The introduction of a handover tool for cardiac surgical patients has improved handover from the perspective of its users, and continues to be used with promising adherence 6-months post-implementation. It is a useful resource detailing important patient and surgical information, and continues to be used even after verbal handover was completed. Barriers to effective transition of patients into the ICU with high-quality handover were identified and can be targeted for continuous quality improvement interventions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 90, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transitions in Critical Care: Evaluating the Implementation of a Handover Tool for Postoperative Cardiac Surgery Patients"}, {"text": "To optimize organ donation performance the nature and impact of complex factors need to be understood. Some factors are well known and might not be modifiable (contra-indications for transplant, age limit of organ donor, etc), but others (collaboration and relationships) that contribute to variations among similar hospitals in the same province, are poorly understood. Objectives: The overall aim of this research is to understand the nature and impact of relationships within the organizational context of organ donation programs in Ontario. Methods: We will employ an exploratory, prospective, diagnostic study consisting of three approaches: (1) to describe the characteristics of social networks of health care professionals of the organ donation programs (Social Network Analysis) and (2) to describe the organizational attributes and processes of on organ donation programs (Multiple Case-Study), and (3) to compare the influence of social networks and organizational attributes on the performance of organ donation programs (Network Comparison). The study sites will include Ontario hospitals designated as type A based on trauma centre level (Public Hospitals Act classification); and hospitals partners of the Ontario's Organ Donation Organization. At least five sites will be purposely selected to capture the greatest variability of settings possible. Results: We have initiated the study, signed a data protection agreement with Ontario's Organ Donation Organization, and we are now on the first site collecting data. Conclusion: Understanding the influences of informal networks on organ donation outcomes is essential to the development and informing of interventions to optimize performance. This research will increase organ donation rates in Ontario by providing to the scientific community a novel measure of organ donation programs' performance and by identifying successful collaboration paths during organ donation processes. We will present the development process of the research as well as preliminary findings.Introduction/Background: Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a vascular reflex mechanism that responds to changes in systemic blood pressure in order to maintain constant cerebral blood flow. CA dysfunction during cardiac surgery, intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury is associated with negative outcomes [1] [2] [3] . Less is understood about CA function in the setting of critical illness. We recently showed that cerebral oxygenation during critical illness was associated with delirium, which may be related to CA dysfunction 4 . We analyzed CA function in critically ill patients during the first 24-72 hrs in the ICU using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based cerebral oximetry [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . We developed a novel approach to derive mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets that may help optimize cerebral perfusion in individual patients. Objective: To identify putative MAP targets in critically ill patients using NIRS-based cerebral oximetry. Methods: MAP and rSO2 were recorded simultaneously for up to the first 72 hours in ICU (n = 40 patients) by arterial catheter and NIRS, respectively. The cerebral oximetry index (COx) was computed as the moving Spearman correlation between MAP and rSO2 (Figure 1, 2) . Positive COx values were taken to reflect CA dysfunction while near-zero or negative COx values reflect intact CA [5] [6] [7] . We asked whether certain MAP values were associated with intact vs dysfunctional CA, and so binned the MAP values by COx (in bins of 0.05, from -1 to +1). This approach builds on previous research to identify optimal cerebral perfusion targets [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Results: COx signals were variable between patients, with some patients exhibiting greater periods of CA dysfunction than others. In a separate parallel analysis, we found that CA dysfunction was associated with the subsequent development of delirium (data not shown). After sorting MAP values into their associated COx bins, the resulting plots adopted four general patterns: negative slope (n = 18/40 patients, Figure 3A ), positive slope (2/40, Figure 3B ), flat (13/40, Figure 3C ) and complex (7/40, Figure 3D ). Plots with either positive or negative slopes clearly showed certain MAP 'danger' zones that were associated with CA dysfunction (high COx values), as well as relative 'safe' zones ( Figure 3A-B) . Danger zones and safe zones were separated by 8 \u00b1 4 mmHg on average, with average MAPs of 76 \u00b1 8 mmHg and 82 \u00b1 10 mmHg, respectively. MAP targets were not readily discernable in plots with flat or complex morphologies from the other half of our study subjects ( Figure 3C-D) . The basis for the different plot morphologies is presently unclear, but may be related to the patients' position on the cerebral autoregulation curve. Conclusions: We outlined an approach for identifying patient-specific MAP targets using NIRS-based cerebral oximetry. This strategy may help preserve cerebral blood flow and reduce the risk of negative neurocognitive outcomes. Our data demonstrate how patient-specific parameters can inform the identification of MAP targets on a caseby-case basis, and suggest that the classic MAP target of 65 mmHg during critical illness may need revisiting [12] [13] . The ability to identify physiological targets in individual patients in real-time may allow precise personalized interventions that have the potential to improve outcomes for survivors of critical illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2353, "end": 2356, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2360, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2364, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2735, "end": 2738, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2739, "end": 2742, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2746, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2750, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2754, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3390, "end": 3393, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3394, "end": 3397, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3398, "end": 3401, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3648, "end": 3651, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3652, "end": 3655, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3656, "end": 3659, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3660, "end": 3663, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3664, "end": 3667, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3668, "end": 3672, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3673, "end": 3677, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5268, "end": 5272, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5273, "end": 5277, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3260, "end": 3273, "text": "(Figure 1, 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4093, "end": 4102, "text": "Figure 3A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4128, "end": 4137, "text": "Figure 3B", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4154, "end": 4163, "text": "Figure 3C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4185, "end": 4194, "text": "Figure 3D", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4381, "end": 4393, "text": "Figure 3A-B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4658, "end": 4670, "text": "Figure 3C-D)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction:"}]}
