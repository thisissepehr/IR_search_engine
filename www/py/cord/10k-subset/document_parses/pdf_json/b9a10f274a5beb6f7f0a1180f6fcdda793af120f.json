It is important to stress that the activity of the respiratory centers cannot be measured directly, and therefore the physiological consequences are used to quantify respiratory drive. Most authors define respiratory drive as the intensity of the output of the respiratory centers [3] , using the amplitude of a physiological signal as a measure for intensity. Alternatively, we consider the respiratory centers to act as oscillatory neuronal networks that generate rhythmic, wavelike signals. The intensity of such a signal depends on several components, including the amplitude and frequency of the signal. Accordingly, we propose a more precise but clinically useful definition of respiratory drive: the time integral of the neuronal network output of the respiratory centers, derived from estimates of breathing effort. As such, a high respiratory drive may mean that the output of the respiratory centers has a higher amplitude, a higher frequency, or both.",

The frequency and timing of the neural pattern relates to the breathing frequency and the duration of the different phases of the breathing cycle. Three phases can be distinguished in the human breathing cycle: inspiration, post-inspiration, and expiration (Fig. 2) .

The output from the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex increases gradually during inspiration and rapidly declines when expiration commences. Axons of the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex project to premotor and motor neurons that drive the inspiratory muscles and the muscles of the upper airways. The pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex has multiple connections to the other respiratory centers, which is thought to ensure a smooth transition between the different breathing phases and to prevent concomitant activation of opposing muscle groups [6] .",

This is achieved by gradually reducing the excitation (and thus contraction) of the inspiratory muscles, which leads to active lengthening (i.e., eccentric contractions) of the diaphragm [2, 7] . Additionally, the post-inspiratory center controls the upper airway muscles. Contraction of the upper airway muscles increases expiratory flow resistance, effectively reducing expiratory flow. Post-inspiratory activity increases the time before the respiratory system reaches endexpiratory lung volume. This can lead to a more laminar expiratory flow and might prevent alveolar collapse, while also increasing the duration of gas exchange in the alveoli [2] . Post-inspiration is a common part of the breathing cycle in healthy subjects at rest, but disappears rapidly when respiratory demands increase, to favor faster expiration [8] (Fig. 2) .",

These receptors are sensitive to the hydrogen proton concentration ([H + ]) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), commonly known as pH [12] . Because CO 2 can rapidly diffuse across the bloodbrain barrier, changes in PaCO 2 quickly affect the pH of the CSF. A set point exists in the control centers, which keeps pH (and PaCO 2 ) within a relatively tight range. A slight increase in PaCO 2 above this set point provides a powerful stimulus to breathe: a change in PaCO 2 of 5 mmHg can already double minute ventilation in healthy subjects. When PaCO 2 decreases only a few mmHg below the set point, the respiratory drive lowers gradually [13] and can abruptly disappear causing apnea, especially during sleep. In contrast, metabolic changes in pH are sensed less rapidly because it takes several hours before the electrolyte composition of the CSF is affected by changes in metabolic acid-base conditions.

The respiratory centers are located in the medulla and the pons and consist of groups of interneurons that receive information from sources sensitive to chemical, mechanical, behavioral, and emotional stimuli. Important central chemoreceptors are located near the ventral parafacial nucleus (pF V ) and are sensitive to direct changes in pH of the cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies are the primary site sensitive to changes in PaO 2 , and moderately sensitive to changes in pH and PaCO 2 . Mechano and irritant receptors are located in the chest wall, airway, lungs, and respiratory muscles. Emotional and behavioral feedback originate in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. The pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (preB\u00f6tC) is the main control center of inspiration, located between the ventral respiratory group (VRG) and the B\u00f6tzinger complex (B\u00f6tC). The post-inspiratory complex (PiCo) is located near the B\u00f6tzinger complex. The lateral parafacial nucleus (pF L ) controls expiratory activity and has continuous interaction with the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex, to prevent inefficient concomitant activation of inspiratory and expiratory muscle groups: lung inflation depresses inspiratory activity and enhances expiratory activity, which ultimately results in lung deflation. Lung deflation has the opposite effect on these centers",

Their contribution to respiratory drive in healthy subjects is therefore probably modest. However, concomitant hypercapnia and acidosis have a synergistic effect on the response of the carotid bodies, meaning their output is increased by more than the sum of the individual parts.

            "text": "Excessive respiratory drive could promote lung injury through several mechanisms. In the absence of (severe) respiratory muscle weakness, high respiratory drive leads to vigorous inspiratory efforts, resulting in injurious lung distending pressures. Recent experimental studies demonstrate that this may worsen lung injury, especially when the underlying injury is more severe [19, 20] . Particularly in patients with acute respiratory failure, large inspiratory efforts could result in global and regional over-distention of alveoli and cyclic recruitment of collapsed lung areas, due to an inhomogeneous and transient transmission of stress and strain (so-called P-SILI) [3, 21] . Large efforts may cause \"pendelluft\": air redistributes from nondependent to dependent lung regions, even before the start of mechanical insufflation, and hence without a change in tidal volume [20] . Excessive respiratory drive may overwhelm lung-protective reflexes (e.g., Hering-Breuer inflation-inhibition reflex), which in turn leads to high tidal volumes and promotes further lung injury and inflammation [3] . In addition, large inspiratory efforts could result in negative pressure pulmonary edema, especially in patients with lung injury and/or capillary leaks [21] . As such, a high respiratory drive is potentially harmful in spontaneously breathing mechanically ventilated patients with lung injury. Applying and maintaining a lung-protective ventilation strategy (i.e., low tidal volumes and low plateau pressures) is challenging in these patients and may often lead to the development of patientventilator dyssynchronies, such as double-triggering and breath stacking, again leading to high tidal volumes and increased lung stress. Furthermore, maintaining low plateau pressures and low tidal volumes does not guarantee lung-protective ventilation in patients with high respiratory drive.",

Diaphragm weakness is associated with prolonged ventilator weaning and increased risks of ICU readmission, hospital readmission, and mortality [28] . In addition, low respiratory drive can lead to patient-ventilator dyssynchronies, such as ineffective efforts, central apneas, auto-triggering, and reverse triggering [29] . Excessive ventilator assistance may result in dynamic hyperinflation, particularly in patients with obstructive airway diseases. Dynamic hyperinflation reduces respiratory drive and promotes ineffective efforts (i.e., a patient's effort becomes insufficient to overcome intrinsic PEEP).

Provided that the neuromuscular transmission and muscle fiber membrane excitability are intact, EA di is a valid measure of phrenic nerve output and thus the most precise estimation of respiratory drive [7, 31] . Realtime recording of the EA di signal is readily available on a specific type of ICU ventilator (Servo-I/U, Maquet, Solna, Sweden). The EA di signal is acquired using a dedicated nasogastric (feeding) catheter with nine ringshaped electrodes positioned at the level of the diaphragm [31] . Computer algorithms within the ventilator software continuously select the electrode pair that is closest to the diaphragm, and correct for disturbances such as motion artifacts, esophageal peristalsis, and interference from the electrocardiogram or other nearby muscles. EA di reflects crural diaphragm activity and is representative of activity from the costal parts of the diaphragm (and thus the whole diaphragm). In addition, the EA di signal remains reliable at different lung volumes and was found to correlate well with transdiaphragmatic pressure (P di ) in healthy individuals and ICU patients [32, 33] . As respiratory drive comprises both an amplitude and duration component, the inspiratory EA di integral may better reflect respiratory drive than EA di amplitude alone.",

The P 0.1 is the static pressure generated by all inspiratory muscles against an occluded airway at 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration. The P 0.1 was described over 40 years ago as an indirect measurement of drive that increases proportionally to an increase in inspiratory CO 2 and directly depends on neural stimulus (i.e., diaphragm electromyography or phrenic nerve activity) [36] . Advantages of P 0.1 are that short and unexpected occlusions are performed at irregular intervals such that there is no unconscious reaction (normal reaction time is >0.15 s) [36] . Second, the maneuver itself is relatively independent of respiratory mechanics, for the following reasons: (1) P 0.1 starts from end-expiratory lung volume, meaning that the drop in airway pressure is independent of the recoil pressures of the lung or chest wall; (2) since there is no flow during the maneuver, P 0.1 is not affected by flow resistance; and (3) lung volume during an occlusion does not change (with the exception of a small change due to gas decompression), which makes it unlikely that vagal volumerelated reflexes or force-velocity relations of the respiratory muscles influence the measured pressure [7, 36] . In addition, the maneuver remains reliable in patients with respiratory muscle weakness [37] , and in patients with various levels of intrinsic PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation [38] . Although the latter patient category shows an important delay between the onset of inspiratory activity at the alveolar level (estimated by esophageal pressure [P es ]) and the drop in airway pressure during an endexpiratory occlusion, Conti et al. proved good correlation and clinically acceptable agreement between P 0.1 measured at the mouth and the drop in P es at the first 0.1 s of the inspiratory effort (r = 0.92, bias 0.3 \u00b1 0.5 cmH 2 O) [38] .

The derivative of P di (dP di /dt) reflects respiratory drive only if both the neural transmission and diaphragm muscle function are intact. As such, high dP di /dt values reflect high respiratory drive. In healthy subjects, dP di /dt values of 5 cmH 2 O/s are observed during quiet breathing [4] . dP di /dt is often normalized to the maximum P di , but maximum inspiratory maneuvers are rarely feasible in ventilated ICU patients. A limitation of using P diderived parameters is that P di is specific to the diaphragm and therefore does not include accessory inspiratory muscles, which are often recruited when respiratory drive is high. Calculating the pressure developed by all inspiratory muscles (P mus ) may overcome this. P mus is defined as the difference between P es (i.e., surrogate of pleural pressure) and the estimated pressure gradient over the chest wall. Other measurements of inspiratory effort are the work of breathing (WOB), and the PTP, which have been shown to correlate closely with P 0.1 [41, 42] . However, all the above measurements require esophageal manometry, a technique that demands expertise in positioning of the esophageal catheter and interpretation of waveforms, making it less suitable for daily clinical practice.

With high inspiratory assistance the patient's respiratory effort may even decrease to virtually zero. The respiratory rate seems much less affected by modulation of ventilatory support [4] .",
