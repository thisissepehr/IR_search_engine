Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of mobile device use on the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in RCHs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Results: A total of 235 senior residents (aged 82.58 \u00b1 5.54) in four RCHs were surveyed. Users of mobile devices had a significantly higher total MoCA score (25.02 \u00b1 4.14) and a significantly lower GDS-15 score (3.28 \u00b1 2.74) than non-users (MoCA: 19.34 \u00b1 5.21, GDS-15: 4.69 \u00b1 2.90). Multivariate linear regression indicate that mobile device use is significantly associated with total MoCA score, six of the seven sub-scores (visuospatial abilities and execution functions, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation)(P < 0.05). Logistic regression showed that mobile device use was significantly associated with the level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.458, 95%CI = 0.249-0.845).

A metaanalysis indicates that the annual conversion rate from MCI to dementia is approximately 20% in community settings and over 30% in memory clinics [7] .

Social interaction is considered as one of the lifestyle factors that play a significant role in maintaining or improving cognitive functioning in older adults. A growing body of literature has described positive effects of social engagement and negative effects of social isolation on cognitive performance in older adults [24] . Previous research [25, 26] has shown that frail older adults living in retirement homes are especially vulnerable to social isolation and loneliness, which is related to decreased social networks, mobility, health status, and interaction with close ties. The most distinctive features of mobile devices are access to Internet, multimedia and multi-task processing. In our study, the mobile devices users living in RCHs used the device for communication with social ties (family members, friends, staff in the RCH, etc.), entertainment (listening to music, watching videos, playing games, etc.) and information search (keeping up with current events and latest news, looking up recipes and health information online, etc.). Studies suggest that digital communication technologies embedded in mobile devices can contribute to social connectedness (meaningful social interaction) and help tackle feelings of loneliness and factors leading to social isolation in later life [27, 28] . Enhanced social connectedness may have contributed to the significantly higher cognitive scores of mobile device users in MoCA test and lower risks for geriatric depression in our study. The results of the logistic regression have revealed that the female residents in RCHs had a significantly lower risk for depressive symptoms, which might be due to that they were more socially engaged than male residents. Research by Small et al. [29] points out that Internet use augments cognitive skills, stating that some areas of the brain in the 24 neurologically normal subjects aged 55-76 were more active in both decision-making tasks and complex reasoning tasks after several sessions of Internet search. These results indicate that, in spite of the changes in neurobiological functioning caused by aging, complex cognitively-engaging activities such as Internet searching may improve brain functions in older adults, thus enhancing their cognitive skills, especially executive functions. In addition, playing games on mobile devices has also been proven to have generalized positive effects on cognitive control abilities in older adults [30] . These findings are consistent with the results of our survey-mobile device users performed significantly better in dimensions such as visuospatial abilities and execution functions, attention and orientation than non-users.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 649, "end": 653, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 654, "end": 657, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1605, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1609, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2051, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2749, "end": 2753, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese older adults was 23.6% [31] . The prevalence of depressive symptoms among the RCH residents in our study was 37.9%, which is consistent with the findings of Jongenelis et al. [32] that the prevalence of depression in the residential care population is higher than that in the community-setting. Studies have revealed that self-confidence, feelings of loneliness, social interaction, satisfaction with one's life, and depression can be improved when older adults learn how to use computers and gain access to Internet [33, 34] . Moreover, older adults are motivated to use digital technology to support their mental health through mechanisms of distraction (from unwanted thoughts and may help to concentrate the mind), normalization (reading online descriptions of symptoms of poor mental health are felt to be normalizing), and facilitated expression of mental states (helpful for exploring their own feelings and being able to express these) [14] .

The reasons might be: (1) older adults that use mobile devices are willing to embrace new things and are more confident with new technology-such open-mindedness and optimism benefits cognition to some extent; (2) using instant messaging apps such as WeChat or QQ on the mobile devices strengthens their ties with families and friends and improves social-connectedness, which in turn enhances cognitive function; (3) using mobile devices for entertainment and information search is a source of constant cognitive stimulation.
