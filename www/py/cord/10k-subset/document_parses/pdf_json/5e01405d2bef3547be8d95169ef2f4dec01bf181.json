Our findings suggest that critically ill pediatric HCT patients who require IMV can be supported through neutrophil recovery. Indeed, 61.5% of children without neutrophil recovery at the time of intubation who subsequently achieved recovery also achieved ICU survival. This finding offers important management insight regarding children who require IMV following allo-HCT. While recovery of neutrophils did seem to worsen acuity as assessed by oxygenation failure, need for vasoactive agents and need for RRT, most of these acuity measures were temporary, returning to baseline within 1-2 days. In fact, more patients who achieved neutrophil recovery following IMV required RRT compared with those who achieved recovery prior. Perhaps this is secondary to the cytokine release, inflammatory state associated with neutrophil recovery leading to generalized capillary leak that improved with RRT (with fluid management or cytokine removal by RRT) [19] . Regardless, this data would further support the use of aggressive critical care interventions during this time as the increased acuity is likely short lived and could result in survival. The most common cause of respiratory failure among patients who achieved neutrophil recovery on IMV was pulmonary infection; among patients who never achieved recovery, shock/cardiovascular collapse was the most common indication. These findings suggest that improved survival among patients who subsequently achieved neutrophil recovery on IMV was not limited to those patients with peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome. It is interesting that the children who were admitted to the ICU with neutrophil recovery had poorer survival than those who achieved neutrophil recovery while intubated. Our dataset is limited by the lack of detailed information of the transplant course and previously treated infections prior to ICU admission. However, while it is challenging to determine conclusively why this is the case, one may speculate that diseases contributing to respiratory failure may be a contributing factor. Noninfectious causes of respiratory failure such as bronchiolitis obliterans and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia tend to occur later in the transplant course, after engraftment. These noninfectious causes are challenging to diagnose, demonstrated by the fact that not one of the subjects in this study had a specific noninfectious diagnosis. Not only does the diagnosis pose a problem, but the treatment for many noninfectious pulmonary complications are nonspecific leading to poor outcome. Perhaps, children who present critically ill after neutrophil recovery, are at higher risk for these types of respiratory complications, which contributes to higher mortality. Our current study contributes to the understanding of respiratory failure among children undergoing HCT and should help guide the application of advanced technological therapies for this population. The critical care of the mechanically ventilated pediatric HCT patient is highly variable [18] . There are often strong and divergent perspectives from both specialties providing care. The high mortality rate makes the decision to institute aggressive mechanical support such as intubation, RRT, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation difficult. Our cohort would support that the lack of neutrophils at the time respiratory failure develops is not associated with increased mortality. These patients may benefit from early and aggressive critical care interventions (including RRT) particularly when there are signs of impending neutrophil recovery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1128, "end": 1132, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3208, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Improved outcomes associated with neutrophil recovery raise the question of the utility of granulocyte infusions while on mechanical ventilation, particularly in the setting of an active infection. In this cohort, presence of a respiratory pathogen was not associated with increased mortality while on IMV. It is possible that neutrophil recovery status was a mitigating factor against presence of a respiratory pathogen.

The lack of neutrophil recovery may become even more important when it is combined with additional variables that have been prognostic for respiratory failure mortality such as OI, peak inspiratory pressure, and length of mechanical ventilation. The challenge remains timing of this conversation. This study begins the investigation to determine critical care factors associated with neutrophil recovery. Factors that suggest higher acuity, such as the need for CPR and use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation, were associated with a decreased chance of neutrophil recovery. Perhaps these factors suggest that the patient is too sick to be supported until neutrophil recovery can be achieved.
