The primary study outcome was the improvement of PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio a week after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were change in D-dimer level over time and 28-day survival rate in patients without intubation. Study data were compared with historical untreated comparison group, including 13 patients with AE-IPF who were treated without rhTM before the registration. Results: The mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio for the rhTM treatment group (n = 10) on day 8 significantly improved compared with that on day one (two-way analysis of variance, p = 0.01). The mean D-dimer level tended to decrease in the rhTM group on day 8, but the change was not significant. The 28-day survival rate was 50 % higher in the rhTM group than in the historical untreated comparison group, but the difference was not significant. A post hoc analysis showed that overall survival time was significantly longer in the treated group compared with that of the historical untreated comparison group (p = 0.04, log-rank test).

First, the study was a single center, single arm, non-randomized clinical study, though we used the historical untreated comparison group. Second, the sample size was small, although significant improvement was demonstrated even with this small cohort, suggesting the excellent efficacy of rhTM. There were, however, large variations in patients' background factors before acute exacerbation, the data obtained during acute exacerbation, and the changes in P/F ratio after rhTM administration; clinical courses substantially differed among patients. A larger scale study is required to assess the efficacy of rhTM for treating various types of patients. Third, we did not examine BAL fluid to diagnose AE-IPF. The main purpose of BAL fluid examination was to eliminate the possibility of an active infection. Instead of examining BAL fluid, we determined the presence or absence of an infectious disease by clinical examination, culture tests, antigen testing, antibody testing, and procalcitonin level measurement. An antibacterial agent was administered prior to rhTM treatment when infectious disease was suspected, and rhTM treatment was started only when the absence of an infection was confirmed. Antibacterial agents were given to 3 patients whose symptoms did not improve after starting rhTM plus steroid treatment, but their symptoms also did not improve with antibacterial administration, and they subsequently died. Antibacterial agents were not administered to the remaining 7 patients until they were discharged. The possibility of an opportunistic infection was low in the 10 rhTM subjects included in the analysis because they did not receive any steroid or immunosuppressant treatment and did not have poorly controlled diabetes. Therefore, the possible involvement of a known infectious disease was considered to be low in the disease conditions of the patients with AE-IPF who received rhTM treatment. However, as mentioned above, BAL fluid examination is thought to be useful to assess coagulation and fibrinolytic functions as well as to eliminate the possibility of infection. Thus, examination of BAL fluid as well as measurement of coagulation and fibrinolytic markers in BAL fluid should be performed when patient's conditions permit.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our findings showed that treatment with rhTM and a steroid improves oxygenation in patients with AE-IPF and is expected to improve their survival without the use of other combination therapies.
