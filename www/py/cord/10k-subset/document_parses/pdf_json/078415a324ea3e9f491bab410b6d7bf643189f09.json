Several factors may have contributed to this. Most influenza deaths are believed to be due to pneumonia, but the virus can cause encephalopathy, myocarditis, and myositis. Our results raise the possibility that a significant proportion of our patients may have died due to these clinically unrecognized complications. Alternatively, influenza may have had generalized effects (perhaps related to the massive production of interferon or other cytokines) that were not associated with classic respiratory symptoms. Communication disorders, such as dementia or dysphasia, are common in this patient group, and in these circumstances, accurate identification of clinical influenza or lower respiratory tract infection is often difficult. Many of the patients whom staff suspected of having viral illness or lower respiratory tract infection had vague symptoms or signs, and only a small number fulfilled our disease criteria. In addition, knowledge of patient and staff vaccination status may have influenced staffreporting of suspected viral illness and lower respiratory tract infection.

However, in these studies, all patients were offered vaccine, and comparisons then were made between those who accepted and those who refused. This approach is likely to result in the unvaccinated control group consisting of patients who are more dependent and who have greater prevalence and severity of dementia [19] . Disability and dementia are associated with increased mortality, and therefore could act as confounding factors in the interpretation of the effects of vaccination. Case-control studies of deaths from influenza perhaps provide stronger evidence for benefit of influenza vaccine in frail elderly institutionalized persons [4] .
