Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all infections caused by S. maltophilia in HSCT recipients in a single center in Israel during a 4 year period. Results Of 570 patients undergoing HSCT, 19 patients with an invasive S. maltophilia infection were identified. Sixteen had allogeneic HSCT and 3 had autologous HSCT. Seventeen patients (90%) had an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) at the time of infection. S. maltophilia infections were detected in three clinical settings: as a complication of prolonged neutropenia (n = 9), as a CVCrelated non-neutropenic infection occurring after CVC manipulation (n = 8) and as a respiratory tract infection (n = 2). Eleven patients (58%) had a polymicrobial infection. Ten patients (52.6%) received carbapenems during the previous month. The treatment for all patients included broad spectrum antibiotics, which were switched according to susceptibilities upon identification of the isolates. All isolates were susceptible in vitro to TMP-SMX. CVCs were removed in 12 patients (70%). Six patients, all after allogeneic HSCT, died. The CVC was removed in only two of the five patients with CVCs who died. Conclusions Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in HSCT recipients, both in the early neutropenic phase and in the non-neutropenic phase. It is commonly associated with the presence and manipulation of an indwelling CVC.

During the early post-transplant period, HSCT recipients have two critical risk factors for invasive infections: prolonged neutropenia and breaks in the mucocutaneous barrier, resulting from the HSCT preparative regimen and from frequent vascular access required for patient care. The use of longterm central venous catheters (CVC) has become an essential part of the management of bone marrow transplant recipients and its importance in the pathogenesis of bacterial, as well as invasive fungal blood stream infections is well established [1] [2] [3] .
