Majority of pediatric acute liver failures have unknown etiology. This review intends to discuss the current literature on the challenging aspects of management of acute liver failure. Recent Findings Collaborative multidisciplinary approach for management of patients with pediatric acute liver failure with upfront involvement of transplant hepatologist and critical care specialists can improve outcomes of this fatal disease. Extensive but systematic diagnostic evaluation can help to identify etiology and guide management. Early referral to a transplant center with prompt liver transplant, if indicated, can lead to improved survival in these patients. Summary Prompt identification and aggressive management of pediatric acute liver failure and related comorbidities can lead to increased transplant-free survival and improved post-transplant outcomes, thus decreasing mortality and morbidity associated with this potential fatal condition.

The clinical features of HE can range from subtle cognitive or motor deficits to irritability to overt cerebral edema leading to coma. Pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is not completely understood. Hyperammonemia, increased cerebral blood flow, and augmented inflammatory response are pivotal in causing the increased intracranial pressure [12] . Glutamine is broken down into ammonia and glutamate by glutaminase in the enterocytes. This gut-derived ammonia then enters the urea cycle where it is detoxified and excreted by the kidneys. The ammonia that bypasses the urea cycle is then converted to glutamine in astrocytes, skeletal myocytes, and hepatocytes. Astrocytes, the predominant type of cells in the brain, are very sensitive to rapid increase in serum levels of ammonia which, in turn, cause increase in intracellular glutamine concentration, leading to increased osmotic gradient and influx of water into the astrocytes resulting in cerebral edema (CE) and, subsequently, intracranial hypertension (ICH) [2\u2022\u2022, 13] . Plasma concentration of ammonia does not always consistently correlate with the clinical manifestations of HE [14] . Increase in circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor, can cause changes to cerebral blood flow and endothelial permeability affecting the development of HE and CE [15] . The incidence of CE and ICH is partially related to the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. About 55% of children developed HE in the PALF study group, 75% of which were grade 1 and 2 encephalopathies [3] . Grade 3 and 4 encephalopathies were observed in about 17 and 7% patients, respectively [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 557, "end": 561, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1242, "text": "[2\u2022\u2022, 13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1592, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1799, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1892, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Management"}, {"text": "Hepatic encephalopathy is managed with aggressive supportive care.

Elevation of head end of the bed helps improve CSF drainage [16] . Fever and shivering may lead to increased intracranial pressure and should be treated aggressively. Lactulose and other antibiotics like rifaximin and neomycin are commonly used ammonia-lowering strategies used to treat HE; however, data to support this use in ALF is currently lacking [17] . L-Ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) and L-ornithine phenyl acetate (LOPA) are currently being studied for use as ammonia-lowering agents by increasing the renal excretion of the same. These have shown promising results in the adult STOP-ALF trial [18] ; however, there is no data regarding their use in PALF.

Clinical monitoring can be very difficult in pediatric patients with grades III-IV of HE. Cushing's triad (irregular breathing, systemic hypertension, and bradycardia), a sign of ICH, is not uniformly present. Intracranial pressure monitoring allows assessment of CPP (difference between ICP and mean arterial pressure) which helps avoid hypoxic brain injury [9] . There have been multiple studies to assess safety and efficacy of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring. There has been no demonstrated improvement in survival with invasive intracranial pressure monitoring [20] [21] [22] . Invasive intracranial monitoring carries the risk of intracranial hemorrhage which can be fatal in these patients with coagulopathy [23] . The use of invasive ICP monitoring has not been studied in children and its use in PALF remains controversial. [2\u2022\u2022] . Osmotic agents like hypertonic saline (HTS) and mannitol are amongst the principal therapies to reduce cerebral edema [24] . HTS (3-30%) reduces ICP by decreasing cerebral water content by its osmotic effect and improves cerebral blood flow by reducing endothelial swelling by dehydration [25] . As a result, HTS has now been accepted as standard of care in management of ICH in children with traumatic brain injury [26] . In an RCT from King's College, the patients who received HTS had decreased ICP from baseline in the first 24 h and incidence of ICP > 25 mmHg was also significantly lower when compared to standard care [27] . HTS has been studied and is currently recommended as a prophylactic agent to prevent ICP in adults at highest risk for cerebral edema [9] .
