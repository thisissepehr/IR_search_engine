It was introduced into modern scientific writing by Kerr, and colleagues in 1972 to describe a form of cell death distinct from necrosis. 1 Apoptosis was initially recognized as \"programmed cell death,\" a type of cell death that serves to eliminate excessive or unwanted cells, in the course of organ development. Upon receiving specific signals instructing the cells to undergo apoptosis, a number of distinctive biochemical and morphological changes occur in the cell. A family of proteins known as caspases is typically activated in the early stages of apoptosis. These proteins break down or cleave key cellular substrates that are required for normal cellular function, including structural proteins in the cytoskeleton and nuclear proteins, such as DNA repair enzymes. The caspases can also activate other degradative enzymes such as DNases, which begin to cleave the DNA in the nucleus. These biochemical changes result in morphological changes which are characterized by the condensation of nuclear chromatin in the nuclear periphery, cell membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. 2, 3 Meanwhile, apoptotic cell death has been reported to be involved not only in the course of organ development but also in cellar injury such as that occurring in In severe acute pancreatitis, multiple organ failure in the early stage after onset, and sepsis in the late stage, due to infection of pancreatic or peripancreatic devitalized tissue, contribute to its high mortality. In analogy with sepsis, evidence has accumulated of the significance of apoptotic cell death in the systemic manifestations associated with acute pancreatitis. Since we identified apoptosis-inducing activity in pancreatitisassociated ascitic fluid in 1995, a number of investigators, including our group, have reported, through animal experiments, that apoptosis occurred in the parenchymal cells constituting organs, such as alveolar epithelial cells in the lung, renal tubular cells in the kidney, and hepatocytes in the liver, and this apoptosis was involved in organ dysfunction with severe acute pancreatitis. Moreover, through clinical and experimental investigations, apoptosis has been revealed to be involved in the mechanism of infectious complications in acute pancreatitis. Namely, apoptosis in lymphatic tissues and peripherally circulating lymphocytes is involved in the impairment of cellular immunity, and apoptosis in gut epithelial cells is implicated in bacterial translocation. These results suggest that apoptotic cell death may play a considerable role in affecting mortality and morbidity in severe acute pancreatitis. Control of apoptosis could be a potent strategy for improvement of the clinical outcome in severe acute pancreatitis. association with the use inflammatory disease or of antitumor chemotherapeutic agents. 4, 5 Moreover, it has been reported that many cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), 6 tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), 7 and transforming growth factor (TGF-), 8 and free radicals, such as nitric oxide, 9 induce apoptotic cell death in various cell systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 223, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1192, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1194, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2923, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2924, "end": 2925, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3008, "end": 3009, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3085, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3127, "end": 3128, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Severe acute pancreatitis is recognized as a typical pathological condition complicating a systemic inflammatory response with a \"cytokine storm.\" 10 Sepsis is another typical condition associated with the activation of the cytokine cascade, and it is widely accepted that apoptotic cell death is involved in the multiple organ dysfunction and immunological impairment associated with sepsis. 11, 12 Thus, it is logical to assume that apoptotic cell death is involved in the systemic manifestations of severe acute pancreatitis.

We demonstrated that peritoneal macrophage depletion by peritoneal lavage deleted apoptosis-inducing activity in PAAF collected from rats with deoxycholate-induced pancreatitis. 57 Furthermore, the expression of TGF-1 in peritoneal macrophages and the elevation of TGF-1 in PAAF suggested the involvement of peritoneal macrophage-derived TGF-1. As a matter of fact, neutralization of TGF-1 by its antibody partly blocked its apoptosis-inducing activity in vitro. 32 Other than TGF-1, we also found that PAAF evoked marked elevation of the intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 concentration in various cell systems, possibly via the action of platelet-activating factor. 37 Moreover, hematin was clarified to be partly responsible for the apoptosis-inducing activity of PAAF. 38 Norman and colleagues 34, 35 found multiple pathways for PAAF-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. They identified the existence of heat-stable factor(s) in PAAF that elicited apoptosis in cultured hepatocytes, and they found that the p38-MAPK and caspase-3 dependent pathway was involved in PAAF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. 35 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 546, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 829, "end": 831, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1021, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1126, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1152, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1155, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1453, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 245, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Significance of PAAF"}, {"text": "Fas is a cell-surface protein belonging to the TNF receptor family, whereas Fas ligand is a member of the TNF family.

Interestingly, neutralization of HGF by antibody administration enhanced apoptosis in renal tubules, and worsened liver function in rats with necrotizing pancreatitis. In contrast, recombinant HGF prevented PAAF-induced apoptotic cell death in MDCK cells. These observations strongly suggest that HGF is produced in injured organs and functions as an antiapoptotic factor against the organ injury in pancreatitis. 61 Other than HGF, Fiedler et al. 62 proposed the involvement of PC3/TIS/BTG2 gene expression in a protective mechanism against apoptosis in pancreatitis. They reported that PC3/TIS/BTG2 mRNA was overexpressed in the livers and kidneys of rats with necrotizing pancreatitis induced by the intraductal injection of 1% taurocholate 24 h after induction.

So, we should target certain cells or systems exclusively, and one feasible target cell may be the gut epithelial cell. Recently, maintenance of the gut environment has been noted to be important to prevent bacterial translocation in critically ill patients, and the development of specific measures, such as the oral administration of synbiotics, has been proposed to maintain the gut environment. 65 The administration of synbiotics has proven to be beneficial for severe acute pancreatitis by preventing infectious
