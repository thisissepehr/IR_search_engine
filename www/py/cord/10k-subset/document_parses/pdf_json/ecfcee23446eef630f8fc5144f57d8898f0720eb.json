The control target is dictated on the one hand by the measurements and sensors available, some of which have been described above. On the other hand, changing clinical evidence and guidelines present new control targets. The second driver, controller design, remains an engineering problem and is beyond the scope of this paper. A brief overview is given here only to facilitate understanding. A natural evolution of the complexity of the controllers comes with the use of computers and their increasing computing power, and the detailed modeling of the respiratory system, which is used for controller synthesis and testing. Simple proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controllers were used initially [15, 16] . This summation of PID action is the most common controller used in almost all industries nowadays. The tuning (setting up of this controller) is static, meaning the controller needs to be tuned to every patient. To overcome this, adaptive controllers [17] [18] [19] can be used, which change their controller parameters to adapt to the patient or scenario. A mathematical model of the system is required for this, but recent advances in modeling respiratory systems have allowed their increased use. The optimal controller attempts to solve an optimization problem, such as minimizing a cost function, in calculating the actuation variable [20] . Model predictive control (MPC) is another example of an advanced controller which uses a dynamic model of the system [21, 22] . It optimizes the current ventilator settings for the current state, while anticipating future events. Finally, there has also been increasing use of fuzzy control [23, 24] . A fuzzy controller is a rule-based control law, in which the linguistic rules (e.g., if-then-else rules) are fuzzified (blurred) in order to make the control more elastic. These systems are popular in the clinical environment, as the language-based expert knowledge of clinicians is transferred into the design of the controller (which is not the case in PID control, for example).
