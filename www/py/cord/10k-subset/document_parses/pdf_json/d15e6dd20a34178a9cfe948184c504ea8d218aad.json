A chromatography on hydroxyapatite was used to partially purify ANTS from \"sac1 ER extract. The two ANTS-enriched transport activity eluted fractions showed essentially the presence of four bands, one having an apparent MW of 56 kDa, similar to that observed for ANTS identified in rat liver ER. The two fractions reconstituted into liposomes efficiently transported, by a strict counter-exchange mechanism, ATP and ADP. ATP transport was saturable with a Km of 0.28 mM. The ATP/ADP exchange mechanism and the kinetic constants suggest that the main physiological role of ANTS is to catalyse the transport of ATP into ER, where it is used in several energy-requiring reactions and to export back to the cytosol the ADP produced. 5 0 -phosphate; RER, rough ER; SER, smooth ER; TX-100, Triton X-100; TX-114, Triton X-114.",

The morphologically distinct smooth and rough ER (SER and RER, respectively) are formed by the same continuous membrane as the nuclear envelope. Its internal compartment, the ER lumen, is completely separated from the cytosol. This compartmentation often narrows the specificity of luminal enzymes (2) because several potential substrates cannot pass the barrier. The transport of selected substrates across the ER membrane is an additional point where enzyme activity can be potentially regulated. It is, therefore, doubtless that ER functions cannot be properly revealed without understanding the related transport processes which, in turn, require the characterization and identification of the participating membrane proteins.",

It is known that ATP is utilized in the RER lumen in all reactions listed above as energy source (2). Furthermore, the degradation of misfolded or overexpressed proteins, a process that requires ATP, has been postulated to occur within the ER lumen (10, 11). ATP is synthesized in cytosol during glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, where is exchanged with the cytosolic ADP by the action of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) (12, 13).",

The two ANTS-enriched transport activity eluted fractions showed essentially the presence of four bands, one having an apparent MW of 56 kDa, similar to that observed for ANTS identified in rat liver ER. The two fractions reconstituted into liposomes efficiently transported, by a strict counter-exchange mechanism, ATP and ADP. ATP transport was saturable with a Km of 0.28 mM. The ATP/ADP exchange mechanism and the kinetic constants suggest that the main physiological role of ANTS is to catalyse the transport of ATP into ER, where it is used in several energy-requiring reactions and to export back to the cytosol the ADP produced.",

The morphologically distinct smooth and rough ER (SER and RER, respectively) are formed by the same continuous membrane as the nuclear envelope. Its internal compartment, the ER lumen, is completely separated from the cytosol. This compartmentation often narrows the specificity of luminal enzymes (2) because several potential substrates cannot pass the barrier. The transport of selected substrates across the ER membrane is an additional point where enzyme activity can be potentially regulated. It is, therefore, doubtless that ER functions cannot be properly revealed without understanding the related transport processes which, in turn, require the characterization and identification of the participating membrane proteins.",

In a more recent study (21) an ATP transporter from rat liver RER was solubilized and reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes, ATP transport was time and temperature dependent, and inhibited by DIDS, but it was unaffected by carboxyatractyloside, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial AAC (13, 22) . An ATP transport system and its inhibition by DIDS was also demonstrated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ER (17) . In yeast ER a 68-kDa protein (Sac1p) was identified as a carrier responsible for ATP transport during protein translocation (23) . However, it turned out that Sac1p was not an ATP transporter itself, since purified Sac1p reconstituted into proteoliposomes did not catalyse any ATP uptake (24) , rather it acted as an important regulator of the transport process, probably by controlling ER phosphoinositides. The absence of Sac1p resulted in a defect in microsomal ATP transport; however, microsomes from sac1\u00c1 strain retained 15% of ATP transport rate suggesting that another ATP transporter Sac1p independent was present in the microsomal membranes (23) .",

The first 600 ml of the turbid eluate from the Sephadex column were collected, transferred to reaction vessels (100 ml each), and used for transport measurements by the inhibitor stop method (28, 29) . Transport was started by adding external labelled substrate at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. After the required time interval, the reaction was stopped by adding 80 mM pyridoxal 5 0 -phosphate (PLP); in control samples, the inhibitor was added together with the labelled substrate at time zero. The assay temperature was 25 C. Finally, each sample of proteoliposomes (100 ml) was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column (0.6 \u00c2 13 cm) to separate the external from the internal radioactivity. The liposomes eluted with 3 ml of 50 mM NaCl were collected in 4 ml of scintillation mixture, vortexed and counted. For the determination of the [ 14 C]ATP uptake, the experimental values were corrected by subtracting the respective controls (samples inhibited at time zero). For kinetic determinations, the initial transport rate was evaluated from the radioactivity taken up by the proteoliposomes in 1 min, i.e. within the initial linear range of the substrate uptake. Specific transport was referred to the amount of protein in the proteoliposomes (3032). For efflux measurements, proteoliposomes containing 2 mM ATP were labelled with 0.01 mM [ 14 C]ATP by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration (33, 34) . After 40 min, external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75 column. Efflux was initiated by adding unlabelled external substrate or buffer A alone and terminated by the addition of the inhibitor above indicated.",

            "text": "In order to better understand the mechanism of functioning of this transport system, we first optimized the reconstitution procedure of the microsomal fraction. This aim was reached by adjusting the main parameters able to affect the percentage of the active transporter extracted by the detergent from the microsomal membranes and the efficiency of its incorporation into liposomes, i.e. the detergent/lipid ratio, the number of passages through the same Bio-Beads SM-2 column and the pH of the reconstitution mixture (38) . The solubilization of membrane proteins by detergents is a critical step to obtain active extracted proteins suitable for the further successful biochemical characterization (43) . The same amount of microsomal membranes (about 1 mg) was solubilized for 20 min at 4 C with a buffer containing TX-100 or TX-114, two nonionic detergents, 30 mM NaCl and 10 mM PIPES, pH 7. On the basis of our previous experience on membrane proteins solubilization, two different detergent concentrations were chosen, 1, 5 and 2, 5% (w/v) (38, 43) . Once removed the residual unsolubilized material by centrifugation, the supernatant (80100 mg of proteins) was incorporated into liposomes. In all tested conditions, no significant difference was observed in the measured transport activities, even though the highest activity was found in extracts solubilized in the presence of TX-100 (2, 5% w/v) ( Fig. 2A) . In order to verify the efficacy of our solubilization procedure in term of amount of transport activity recovered per mg of microsomal membrane proteins used, we solubilized the same amount of ER membranes using 3% TX-100, 150 mM Na 2 SO 4 and 10 mM TrisHCl pH 7, as described previously by Mayinger et al. (23) ; in four independent experiments only 20% of the ATP/ATP exchange activity reported in Fig. 1 was found (data not shown) . Several detergent/phospholipid ratios were tested in order to optimize the reconstitution procedure. In such experiments, the [ 14 C]ATP/ATP exchange rate was measured, and the optimal transport activity was obtained by reconstituting the microsomal extracts in the presence of 7 mg of Triton X-114 (1% w/v), 10 mg of L-a-phosphatidylcholine (1, 42% w/v) and 2, 4 mg of asolectin (0, 34% w/v), with an optimal detergent/ phospholipid ratio of 0.56 w/w (data not shown). Asolectin was required in the reconstitution mixture to get a functional active transporter. The addition in the reconstitution mixture of cardiolipin, (20200 mg/ ml), which was essential to reconstitute in a more active form the mitochondrial AAC carrier (44, 45) (Fig. 2B) or of cholesterol (15 mg/ml), used to assay the ER Sac1p-dependent ATP transport (23), did not exert any ameliorative effect on the ATP/ATP exchange activity (Fig. 2B) . The influence of different pH values in the solubilization buffer and reconstitution mixture on the [ 14 C]ATP/ATP exchange rate was also investigated. The highest transport rates were measured in a range of pH between 7 and 8, even though at pH 7 a higher reproducibility of the maximal transport activity was observed. At pH values lower than 7, the rate of ATP transport drastically decreased (Fig. 2C) .",

            "text": "Partial purification of the microsomal ANTS on HTP In order to identify the putative protein responsible for the [ 14 C]ATP/ATP transport activity measured in the reconstituted microsomal extract, the TX-100 extract of ER membranes was applied on a HTP column and several fractions were recovered by eluting the column with the same solubilization buffer. Only in the first 2 fractions some bands were visible on silver-staining The mitochondrial/peroxisomal (M/P) and ER fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation from the wild-type and sac1\u00c1 yeast strains homogenate, subjected to SDS-PAGE (50 mg/lane) and tested for their purity by western blot analysis. The subcellular fractions were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunodecorated with antibodies raised against COX or DPM1, top and bottom panels, respectively. (B) Purified ER membranes from the wild-type and sac1\u00c1 yeast strains, were solubilized by TX100 detergent and reconstituted into proteoliposomes in the presence of 10 mM ATP. Transport was started by external adding 0.1 mM [ 14 C]ATP and stopped after 10 min; the inhibitors, carboxyatractyloside (CAT) or DIDS were added together with the labelled substrate. Values are means \u00b1 S.D. of at least three independent experiments. SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) , 100 ml of each fractions were reconstituted into liposomes. Both reconstituted fractions catalysed an efficient [ 14 C]ATP/ATP exchange reaction (Fig. 3B) . By comparing the [ 14 C]ATP/ATP exchange activity catalysed by the reconstituted extract (Fig. 3A, lanes 2) with those of the two fractions (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) , it was evident that the purification step increased ANTS-specific activity by about 950-fold (Fig. 3B) . Interestingly, the two HTP fractions showed essentially four bands with apparent molecular weights of 30, 56, 64 and 65 kDa, respectively. Since many members of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) have a molecular weight of about 30 kDa, in order to exclude that the 30 kDa band could derive from the presence of one of the functionally unknown or biochemically not characterized mitochondrial carrier (MC) in the ER membrane, we reconstituted the ER membrane extracts of the following deletion strains: YFR045W\u00c1 and ant1\u00c1 (YPR128C) . The last strain was tested since Ant1p, although biochemically characterized (15) , was the only member of the yeast MCF not localized in the mitochondria but in the peroxisomal membrane. No significant difference was found between the [ 14 C]ATP/ATP exchange reaction catalysed by the sac1\u00c1 ER extract and those of the various MCs deletion yeast strains (Fig. 3C) . Furthermore, we excluded that the 30 kDa band could represent the yeast Aac2p, the most abundant isoform of the yeast mitochondrial adenine nucleotide carrier, since it did not react against a specific antibody (42) (data not shown). The tryptic digest from 56 kDa gel band was examined in MS reflection mode, whereas MS/MS experiments were used for peptide sequence discrimination. Identification of the peptides, however, was unsuccessful probably due low sample amounts (Supplementary Data).",

Maximum uptake of [ 14 C]ATP was approached after 20 min. The corresponding value at infinite time was 8.26 mmol/mg protein. The initial rate of ATP uptake (the product of k and the maximal amount of ATP taken up at equilibrium) was 1.87 mmol/min \u00c2 mg protein. In contrast, no [ 14 C]ATP uptake was observed without internal substrate (i.e. when, internal 10 mM ATP was replaced with the same internal amount of NaCl), demonstrating that the transporter did not catalyse a unidirectional transport (uniport) (Fig.  4A ). This issue was further investigated by measuring the efflux of [ 14 C]ATP from pre-labelled active proteoliposomes, as this provides a more sensitive assay for unidirectional transport (46) . In the absence of external substrate, no significant efflux was observed, even after an incubation of 90 min (Fig. 4B) . However, upon addition of external ATP, an extensive efflux of radioactivity occurred. These results showed that the reconstituted ANTS catalysed an obligatory exchange reaction of substrates.",

On this basis, we have decided to shed light on this transport system. In order to unravel the role of Sac1p in the ER nucleotides transport, microsomal membranes from the wildtype and sac1\u00c1 yeast strains were reconstituted into liposomes. Differently from what previously reported (23, 24) , in our experimental conditions both membrane extracts from wild-type and sac1\u00c1 ER catalysed the same ATP/ADP exchange activity and showed the same sensitivity to CAT and DIDS (Fig. 1B) . These results clearly demonstrate that Sac1p has nothing to do with the measured ER ATP/ATP exchange activity. Similar results were previously found in the functional characterization of the ATP transporter from rat liver RE (20) , where a 56 kDa purified protein was identified as responsible for an ATP/ADP exchange activity in the RE; no band at 67 kDa, weight typical of the mammalian SAC1 (51) , was detected in the purified fraction (20) . In order to identify the yeast ER ANTS and to reduce the huge amount of proteins present in the ER extract which could interfere with the reconstitution of the ATP transporter into liposomes, a purification attempt was carried out. By applying TX-100-solubilized sac1\u00c1 ER extract on an HTP column, we recovered two active fractions (Fig. 3A,  lanes 3 and 4) , which essentially showed the same electrophoretic pattern and a similar ATP/ATP exchange activity (Fig. 3B) . The two purified fractions were about 950-fold enriched with respect to the ATP/ ATP exchange activity and contained four bands, one at 30 kDa, another at 56 kDa and a double band at 6566 kDa. The 56 kDa band could represent the putative yeast orthologue of the rat microsomal ATP transporter, since a similar purification pattern was previously obtained during the identification of the rat liver microsomal ATP transporter, with a molecular weight of 56 kDa (20) ; in that work, using a photoaffinity labelling approach, the authors established that the 30 kDa band could be due to the degradation of the 56 kDa band. Furthermore, the high degree of homology very often found between yeast and mammalian orthologues (52) tipped the scales in favour of the 56 kDa band, since the same MW was found for the rat liver ER ATP transporter (20) .",

Before proceeding with these experiments, it was important to exclude that the ATP/ATP exchange activity measured in the HTP eluates was not due to the presence of a MCF member in the microsomal membranes, since among the four bands, visible on the SDS-PAGE of the HTP eluates, the one at 30 kDa was the most abundant and many members of the MCF have a MW ranging from 30 to 36 kDa (52). This doubt was soon ruled out, since the reconstituted microsomal membranes of the yeast strains carrying single deletions for each of the biochemically not characterized MCs showed the same ATP/ATP exchange activity as that of the sac1\u00c1 ER extract (Fig. 3C) . The tryptic digest from 56 kDa gel band was examined in MS reflection mode, whereas MS/MS experiments were used for peptide sequence discrimination. The human keratins originate from chemicals and/or sample handling become ubiquitous at low levels, as in the context of silver-stained gels. The pattern of keratin peptides is not predictable, thus the interrogation of the PMF (MASCOT search program), contaminants 20090624 (262 sequences; 133,770 residues) was performed as control. Keratin, type II cuticular Hb6 (Hair keratin, type II Hb6) (ghHb6)-Homo sapiens (Human) was identified using two masses corresponding to two possible sequences characterized by insignificant protein scores (score520) (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Searching the complete set of tryptic peptide masses in a NCBIprot 20180429 (152462470 sequences; 55858910152 residues), Taxonomy [Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) (134,049 sequences)], Top Score: 89 for AJV32483.1, Fig. S4 ). Further database searches did not retrieve any significant matches and we therefore concluded that band 56 kDa contained mainly one YJM1342. Imd2p is inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, catalysing the conversion of inosine 5 0 -phosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5 0 -phosphate (XMP). The identification of the band was unambiguous since the other retrieved proteins identified had significantly fewer matching tryptic peptides, a different intact molecular weight, and were from a different species. MS and MS/MS data suggest that the identification of the protein responsible for the transport activity was unsuccessful probably due to the very low amounts present in the sample.",

A guanine nucleotides transport by ANTS had never been described up to date. Furthermore, ANTS substrate specificity is not shared with any of the functionally known MCs, ruling out, once again, that the 30 kDa band in the HTP eluates could be due to the presence of a MCF member in the microsomal membranes. Although the guanine nucleotides transport catalysed in vitro by ANTS may not necessarily occur in vivo, it should be emphasized that a GTP/ATP exchange activity was also found in the chromaffin granules (56) .",

The Km for ATP measured in our experimental conditions was 0.28 mM whereas those previously found for the yeast and rat microsomal ATP transporter were about 10 mM. One possible explanation of this difference may reside in the different measuring conditions used to determine the kinetic constants. They are usually determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external labelled substrate concentrations. These measurements should be taken at very short interval of time, when the transport rate is a linear function of time. Thus it is important to block all samples (having different external substrate concentrations) instantaneously, completely and at the same time in order to get reliable results, here we used the technique of the stop-inhibitor (28) , which guarantees all these conditions; differently, the kinetic parameters previously measured for the yeast and rat liver ER transporter (20, 23) were determined by blocking the exchange reactions by the filtration technique which requires some seconds. It should also be emphasized that a K m for ATP in a millimolar range, found in this work, was also demonstrated for the ATP transporter of the chromaffin granules (56) . Furthermore, a K m for ATP in a millimolar range would be physiologically more relevant, since cytosolic ATP concentration is in the same range (58) . A micromolar Km for ATP was found for the yeast mitochondrial adenine nucleotide carrier (48) , but in this case it is physiologically relevant, since ATP concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is much lower than that of the cytosol (59) , and it should be kept low in order to keep the oxidative phosphorylation going.",
