The question that persists is: How do house-hold cleanliness and personal hygiene affect the risk of infectious disease transmission? The purpose of this paper is to examine current health care literature regarding the microbiology of the home environment, to summarize evidence of transmission within the home, and to assess the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting practices and products in controlling transmission.

Cross-contamination occurred in a large proportion of those kitchens surveyed and in many cases the indicator organism persisted even after washing and rinsing of the kitchen surfaces. 11 Scott et al. measured numbers and types of bacteria at various sites in more than 200 English homes. The highest counts were isolated from wet areas such as U-tubes, kitchen sink, draining board, cleaning cloths and mops, and dishcloths, and pseudomonads were isolated in over 90% of the homes. 2 In a subsequent study Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 69% of the homes surveyed. 4 Contaminated dishcloths and other cleaning utensils also may act both as reservoirs and disseminators of pathogenic organisms. 2, 6 Although drying reduces the number of organisms on clean, laminate surfaces, large numbers of bacteria have been recovered from contaminated surfaces and both clean and soiled cloths as much as 24 to 48 hours after drying. 3 Thus, drying alone is not sufficient to eliminate contaminating organisms. Further, finger contact with contaminated surfaces and cloths resulted in the transfer of large numbers of organisms to the hands. 3 Cloths used for cleaning and/or drying kitchen utensils may transfer contamination throughout the kitchen especially when the same cloth is used for multiple purposes. In some households, the same cloth is used to wash cooking and eating cutlery and then to wipe down the drain board and counters. 4 Since plain soap does not necessarily kill microorganisms, soap and water cleaning of contaminated surfaces and hands may actually spread microbial contamination in the environment. 12 Speirs et al. sampled 46 kitchens including the following key sites: worktop, chopping board, draining board, sinks, water tap handles, insides of rubber gloves, refrigerator shelf, and dish washing cloth. They isolated various enterobacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. In addition, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcal and micrococcal species were isolated. The highest counts were found in the wet areas around the sink and the cloths used for wiping and/or drying kitchen surfaces and appliances. 4 In another study, the sink drain was the most contaminated site, harboring 5.9-6.2 log 10 (>99.999% reduction) of microorganisms. 13 Enriquez et al. studied 140 cellulose sponges and 56 cotton dishcloths from households in four U.S. cities and isolated 23 and 13 different bacterial species, respectively. Most commonly isolated were pseudomonads, but salmonella was also isolated in 15.4% of the sponges and 13.8% of the cloths. Other commonly isolated gram-negative bacteria included species of enterobacter, serratia, and klebsiella. 5 Salmonella can be transferred to sponges and towels and survive there, resulting in contamination of other areas of the kitchen. 6 Specific risk factors for domestic outbreaks of foodborne pathogens include improper food storage, undercooking, and cross-contamination, which may be responsible for 30% of salmonella outbreaks in the home. 14 During food preparation salmonella can be spread throughout the workspace by such actions as whisking batter; bacteria have been found one meter away from each side of the site. Powered cooking equipment like the electric blender can also lead to widespread distribution, up to a 3-4 meter radius around the site. In experiments with chickens contaminated with salmonella and campylobacter, a variety of sites in the kitchen, including cutting boards, sinks, handles, faucets, and work areas tested positive after the usual meal preparation procedures were used. 14, 15 In a case control study of food preparation, salmonella was isolated from dishcloths not only in case homes in which salmonella infection persisted but also in control homes. Salmonella from dried foods that have contact with moist foods, such as fruit or meat, can transfer within 5 seconds to the wet foods. Within a few hours potentially infective doses can be reached as the bacteria multiply under moist conditions. 14 Temperature of the water used for \"washing up\" can also influence microbial survival. For dishes washed by hand, the dishwashing water temperature often is below 50\u00b0C at the start and will continue to drop during the dishwashing process. This temperature is not high enough to destroy most organisms. A few studies have demonstrated that when sterile cookware was washed in water inoculated with salmonella or campylobacter, transfer of the pathogen to the dishes occurred. 6, 14 Bathroom Like the kitchen, the bathroom can be a reservoir of large numbers of microorganisms, particularly in wet areas. In homes in which a family member had salmonellosis, four of six toilets tested positive for salmonella under the recess of the toilet bowl rim, an area difficult to reach with domestic toilet cleaners. In one toilet, salmonella was still present four weeks after the infection, despite the use of cleansers. After artificial contamination of the toilet, flushing led to contamination of the toilet seat and lid, and in one instance salmonella was isolated from an air sample taken after flushing. 16 There is limited evidence of antibiotic-resistant organisms being present in the home environment. In both the bathrooms and the kitchens of 25 randomly selected homes in North Carolina, four of 58 enterococcal isolates were vancomycin-resistant and one of 17 Escherichia coli isolates was ampicillin-resistant. Klebsiella and enterobacter strains had the highest frequency of resistance to ampicillin, and pseudomonal strains were uniformly susceptible to 4 of the 10 tested antibiotics. Rutala et al. concluded that in comparison to organisms causing clinical infections in hospitals, those isolated in homes are less likely to be antimicrobial resistant. 13", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 373, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 374, "end": 395, "text": "Scott et al. measured", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 669, "end": 670, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 756, "end": 757, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 885, "end": 887, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 888, "end": 889, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1114, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1322, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1622, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1807, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2379, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2512, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2917, "end": 2918, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3048, "end": 3049, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3824, "end": 3827, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3828, "end": 3830, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4252, "end": 4254, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4729, "end": 4731, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 4732, "end": 4734, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 5355, "end": 5357, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Kitchen"}, {"text": "While the kitchen and the bathroom are logical places for the introduction and transmission of pathogens, one area of the home that may seem less likely to allow the survival and dissemination of microorganisms is the washing machine. Various common laundering practices allow bacteria at varying levels to remain in laundered items. Standard detergent washing and rinsing practices do not always produce large reductions in microbial contamination. Damp cloths that had been washed in detergent and then stored at room temperature over a 24-hour period showed an increase in contamination indicative of the survival and multiplication of microbes. Drying was the most reliable method of decontamination when carried out at a temperature of 80\u00b0C for 2 hours. 17 In a study to evaluate the survival of bacteria and enteric viruses during washing and drying as performed in U.S. homes, sterile cotton swabs were inoculated with Mycobacterium fortuitum, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, rotavirus SA1, hepatitis A virus, and adenovirus type 40. The contaminated swabs were then added to sterile cotton underwear, T-shirts, and a pillowcase that contained an organic load typical of homes. All test organisms survived the wash process; wash and rinse cycles alone reduced enteric viruses by 87-98% and bacteria by >99%. During the drying cycle, viruses were more resistant to killing than bacteria. Drying was most effective, in decreasing order, for S. typhimurium, S. aureus, and M. fortuitum. Detectable levels of E. coli were not found after drying. Together, washing and drying reduced all bacteria by at least 99.99%, adenovirus type 40 by 99.91%, hepatitis A virus by 99.8% and rotavirus by 98.6%. The test organisms contaminated other laundry in the machine, as well as the washing machine itself, which led to the contamination of subsequent loads of laundry. 18 Using the Petrocci and Clarke (1969) method, 19 several powder and liquid laundry detergents that are now on the market were tested for activity against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae from wash water and fabric (Table  1 ; Personal Communication, J. Kain, Procter and Gamble, Cincinnati, OH, August 2001) Sanitizing powder detergents reduced S. aureus and K. pneumoniae in the laundry fabric by >99%. All other laundry detergents were less active. Test products were all commercially available detergents with built in oxygen-based bleach systems. All products were purchased at local grocery stores in the Cincinnati Ohio area during 1998. No additional laundry additives, such as chlorine bleach, were tested either alone or in conjunction with detergents. 2 Percent Reduction (% Reduction) refers to the calculated reduction in bacteria relative to a water + 0.5% polysorbate 80 baseline control. Polysorbate 80 was added to the water as a non-toxic surfactant control to improve the relevancy of organism removal characteristics of the control relative to the high surfactancy test treatments. 3 A \"sanitizing detergent with oxygen bleach\" is one that meets US EPA criteria for sanitization claims and a \"non-sanitizing detergent with bleach\" is a detergent that has a bleaching ingredient that may also have antimicrobial properties but not at the concentration and in the formulation matrix of this detergent and, therefore, does not meet US EPA's criteria for sanitization claims.

Other modes of transmission include contact with droplets and airborne spread by droplet nuclei. 20 Indirect contact is transmission through a contaminated intermediate object. Usually, the intermediary is the hands. For example, a parent who changes a diaper of a baby infected with shigella and proceeds to prepare a meal for the family without handwashing could transmit the pathogen to the entire family.

Worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of childhood viral respiratory infection. 20 RSV is transmitted via inanimate objects and direct contact with infected persons. 21 The virus is capable of surviving for a number of hours on inanimate objects and surfaces, providing ample opportunities to contaminate the hands of caregivers. Contaminated hands can indirectly spread the virus to others in the home, including the caregivers if they touch their eyes or nose without handwashing. While barrier precautions have proven effective in lowering the rates of transmission in a hospital setting, Goldmann asserts that it is entirely probable that careful handwashing after contact with infected infants would have been equally effective. 20 Perhaps more widespread than RSV among people of all ages is the common cold. Children can expect to average 4 to 8, and adults, three to five episodes per year. There are more than 100 serologic types of rhi-novirus, and contracting one type provides no immunity against another. 20 Influenza is spread via airborne nuclei droplets, but the most likely route of transmission of rhinovirus is contaminated hands. 22 In the United States, the second most common community infection is gastroenteritis. An important cause of gastroenteritis is rotavirus, which is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and possibly through respiratory spread and contaminated hands and surfaces. Rotavirus has been implicated in outbreaks in hospitals, daycare centers, schools, and nursing homes. There is the potential for transmission of rotavirus within the home since it is present on hands, various surfaces and objects. 23 Other gastrointestinal pathogens, such as hepatitits A virus, parvovirus, adenovirus, and other enteroviruses follow a similar transmission pattern as rotavirus. 24, 25 Hepatitis A, for example, has been implicated in numerous foodborne outbreaks and in various settings such as hospitals, day-care centers, and schools. 26 It is commonly spread via contaminated food and water. In laboratory experiments, Bidawid et. al simulated cross contamination of fresh lettuce with hepatitis A from fingers of adult volunteers. 27", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 302, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 386, "end": 388, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 954, "end": 956, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1240, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1372, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1865, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2031, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2034, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2189, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Routes of Transmission"}, {"text": "The potential for cross-contamination in the kitchen has already been briefly discussed. When not properly cleaned and/or disinfected, countertops, cutting boards, and other kitchen surfaces provide an optimum milieu for survival of microbes. 11 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1983-1992 the primary food preparation practices contributing to foodborne disease were improper storage temperatures and poor personal hygiene of the food handler, 28 and these faulty practices are common in the home. In a study of kitchens in 40 Australian homes, daily practices were videotaped over the course of 1 to 2 weeks. The most common unhygienic practices viewed included infrequent and poor handwashing technique, lack of handwashing prior to preparing meals, pets in the kitchen, hand contact with the face, mouth, nose, and hair during food preparation, and an all-purpose towel for hands and dishes. In addition to these lapses in hygiene, deli meat was left outside the refrigerator and uncovered for 2 hours; a dish towel that had fallen to the floor and been stepped on was subsequently used to wipe off the counter; and a dishtowel was also used to cover cooked meat and thereby cross-contaminate it. 29 Practices caught on film in American homes did not differ substantially from their Australian counterparts. The same towel used to wipe up raw meat juice was then used to dry washed hands. In only 1 in 4 homes were raw meat and seafood properly stored on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator so as to prevent dripping liquids from contaminating other foods; 35% of those preparing meatloaf undercooked it, 42% undercooked the chicken, and 17% did not completely cook the fish. 30 Further, the American Society for Microbiology conducted a telephone survey of more than 7,000 people in the United States. Eighty-one percent of respondents claimed to wash their hands prior to handling or eating food. After petting an animal, 48% reported that they do not wash their hands, nor do 33% after coughing or sneezing, or 22% after handling money. 31 In a telephone survey conducted in Australian homes, 40% of respondents allowed raw meat to thaw at room temperature, 85% cooled cooked food to room temperature prior to refrigeration, and close to 70% did not know the right temperature for refrigeration of perishables. 32 In addition, 1 in 4 respondents did not recognize handwashing as important in the reduction of cross-contamination and foodborne illness. 32 Based on these findings, it is likely that everyday activities in the home will result in microbial spread. A study of the transfer of Serratia rubidea and the virus PRD-1 from common household articles to the hands confirmed that infection is possible from daily contact with contaminated objects. 33 Transmission of the bacterium and the virus were demonstrated on telephone receivers, faucet handles, and sponges, and transfer to hands was highest from hard, nonporous surfaces. 34 If a small amount of stool from a person infected with salmonella were transferred from the individual's contaminated hands to the receiver, the next user could pick up >10 5 colony-forming units (CFU) on his/her fingertips, and could transfer >3.5 \u00d7 10 4 CFU, or 35% of the total, to the mouth, a dose sufficient to cause disease. 33 After wringing out a household sponge, 10 5 -10 6 bacteria and viruses were found on the hands of test subjects. 34 In another study, bacteriophage [phis] X174 was applied to door handles and the hands of volunteers. Test persons touched the handles and shook hands with the volunteers. The hands of the test persons were then sampled for the virus. Both skin surfaces and contaminated door handles were efficient sources for transfer. Up to 14 people became contaminated after touching the same door handle, and subsequent transmission was traced to six additional people from these primary contacts. 35", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 245, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 480, "end": 482, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1238, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1718, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2082, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2356, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2495, "end": 2497, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2797, "end": 2799, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2982, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3315, "end": 3317, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3431, "end": 3433, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential Transmission"}, {"text": "Each year 76 million Americans develop food poisoning, 29 and about 20% of reported foodborne illnesses occur in the home. 30 Ninety percent of salmonella infections are thought to be associated with the home environment. 28 In the UK, cross-contamination has been implicated in about 6% of foodborne outbreaks within the home, while poor hand hygiene is responsible for about 4%. 36 In addition, it has been estimated that cross-contamination in the home contributed to 14% of salmonellosis outbreaks. 36 In a household in which one person has been sick with salmonella, it has been estimated that there is a 60% chance that at least one other member of the household will also be infected. 8 Both hands and inanimate surfaces are responsible for the cross-contamination that leads to secondary infections in the home.

During a 30 week study in Arizona, 15 homes were supplied with a variety of disinfectant products, but no specific use instructions were given. Subsequently, most of the disinfectants were removed, specific ones were introduced, and a cleaning schedule was established. While the greatest reductions in coliforms occurred after initial introduction of products, introduction of the cleaning schedule led to even greater microbial reductions in the 14 kitchen and bathroom sites studied. 50 These results are consistent with the findings of an earlier study demonstrating that disinfectants used in a timely manner after contamination by food or hands reduced further contamination. 51 Kitchen. Studies in the UK have demonstrated that cleaning with detergent and hot water alone did not significantly reduce campylobacter and salmonella from contaminated kitchen areas. However, when cleaning was supplemented with hypochlorite there was a significant reduction in the number of bacteria from contaminated sites. In addition, detergent and water washing of dishware was only effective if followed by a rinsing process. 15 In fact, soap and water can actually increase contamination in the home when not followed by rinsing. 52 This suggests that when rinsing is impractical or not feasible, cleaning alone may be insufficient and disinfection may be indicated. In the UK, antibacterial dishwashing liquid has been shown to effectively reduce numbers of recoverable microorganisms on dishes, but not on used sponges. 53, 54 Zhao et al., inoculated raw chicken with an indicator organism, Enterobacter aerogenes. The same cutting board was then used to prepare chicken and chop raw vegetables, and 10 3 -10 4 CFU of bacteria was transferred to the vegetables. Treating the cutting board with a kitchen disinfectant after preparing the chicken reduced the transmission of bacteria to almost undetectable levels. 55 Disinfection in conjunction with paper towel wiping are reported to be the best procedure for cleaning surfaces contaminated with raw meat. 56 Laundry. Standard laundry practices have changed over the years, and may also contribute to the transmission of microbes in the home. People less frequently hang their clothing and linens outside where the sunlight can aid in denaturing many of the microbes, and ironing, which allows steam to penetrate and reduce the microbial load in the fabric, has become less common. Finally, lower water temperatures with smaller volumes of water are used for washing. 7, 8 Jaska and Fredell (1980) found no significant differences between a phosphate or a phosphate substitute detergent on S. aureus survival on laundered fabrics and reported that the most important predictor of bacterial reduction in the laundry was the water temperature. 57 The temperature of the water used for washing does not seem to affect the bacterial counts in the fabric in the presence of sodium hypochlorite bleach; that is, both hot and cold water in combination with the bleach cycle are equally successful in reducing bacteria counts, 58, 59 but in the absence of bleach, warmer washing temperatures (55\u00b0C) are more effective 60 and colder temperatures may increase the cross-contamination rate of articles washed together. 61 Hence, attaining maximal bacterial reductions in both the machine and fabrics depends both on bleach and the water temperature. [58] [59] [60] 62 Although relying on wash water temperatures to achieve meaningful bacterial reductions is impractical in North America since water heaters are typically set at 120&scedil;C, sodium hypochlorite bleaches for compatible fabrics and newer laundry products containing oxygenated bleach which can be used on colored fabrics will achieve such reductions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 581, "end": 583, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 776, "end": 778, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1215, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1320, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1613, "text": "53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1616, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2003, "end": 2005, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2148, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2608, "end": 2610, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2612, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2637, "text": "Jaska and Fredell (1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2882, "end": 2884, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 3159, "end": 3162, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3163, "end": 3165, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3250, "end": 3252, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3348, "end": 3350, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 3479, "end": 3483, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3484, "end": 3488, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3489, "end": 3493, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3494, "end": 3496, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Studies of the Home Environment"}, {"text": "Bathroom.

Another 15 experimental studies reviewed demonstrated a reduction in bacteria on the skin with use of antimicrobial soaps, but none of these studies assessed rates of infection as an outcome. 67 Increasing public awareness stimulated by several highly publicized and serious outbreaks from commercially prepared foods has raised questions about food safety and the appropriate hygienic practices of food handlers.
