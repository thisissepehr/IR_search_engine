            "text": "The management of severe bacterial sepsis is an integral part of intensive care medicine. Early and appropriate treatment with antimicrobials positively affects mortality and significantly reduces the time spent in both intensive care and the hospital. Drug choice is usually made on a \"best guess\" basis and instituted prior to receipt of appropriate blood, sputum, urine or drainage culture results. Bactericidal drugs should be given in combination, delivered by intravenous bolus and directed towards broad cover of all likely pathogens. Aminoglycoside/ureidopenicillin combinations are synergistic and widely used -often combined with metronidazole. Aminoglycoside toxicity can be reduced by giving the drug once daily (OD) rather than by traditional multiple daily dosing (MDD) and by measuring peak and trough serum levels. Efficacy is increased by attention to the peak serum level/MIC ratio which determines the response to treatment. Several newer agents have been more recently introduced. These drugs include ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, the quinolones and clavulanic acid/semisynthetic penicillin combinations. Other newer drugs currently under evaluation include aztreonam, teicoplanin, the penems and carbapenems.",

Septicaemic shock is most appropriately dealt with by the multidisciplinary team approach in that environment. Most patients come to intensive care after surgery -usually after major abdominal and notably colorectal surgery. Others are admitted following trauma or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. All age groups are represented in intensive carebut the elderly with background disease and septic shock have a significantly higher mortality than do younger patients [1] . This largely reflects an increased incidence of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease and major nutritional problems. The condition of the patient prior to admission greatly influences the outcome following intensive care management. Protracted shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and renal failure with acidaemia and hypoxaemia are associated with a high mortality or protracted stay in ITU if they survive. Early intervention is accompanied by an improved prognosis [2, 3] .",

Oropharyngeal colonisation with potential (usually aerobic Gram-negative enteric derived) pathogens is followed in a significant proportion of patients by the development of pneumonia [5] . This may be complicated by bacteraemia and septic shock. These events are particularly common in patients who require protracted ventilation (IPPV) [6] . Infection is therefore an important limiting factor in the success of treatment delivered in intensive care units and a frequent cause of the patient's demise. For this reason early instigation of \"best guess\" intravenous bolus antimicrobial chemotherapy is widely implemented [7] . Bactericidal drugs are delivered in combination -and generally involve an aminoglycoside with a ureidopenicillin -often combined with metronidazole. Antifungal and antiviral chemotherapy is occasionally also necessary, for example in immunocompromised patients with systemic Candidiasis or CMV pneumonia.",

Vancomycin remains a useful and widely employed drug while teicoplanin [13] is currently being assessed as a possible replacement for vancomycin and for potential use in \"methicillin resistant\" S. aureus (MRSA) infections -which may become a problem in ITU's.

            "text": "Early clinical diagnosis of \"the sepsis syndrome\" [3] and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and supportive treatment has long been known to significantly influence outcome [2] . The mortality from bacteraemia both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, remains unacceptably high at over 20% in spite of the ready availability of a wide range of effective drugs and access to intensive care in most major hospitals. If shock supervenes the mortality rises to over 50~ [14] . It is therefore crucial that the clinical recognition of \"the sepsis syndrome\" be followed by early administration of bactericidal antimicrobials and appropriate supportive therapy to positively influence progression of the condition [7] . The longer the patient is bacteraemic or in shock the worse the outcome. Development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating ventilation is associated with an increased stay in ITU and the potential for development of nosocomial infection -notably Gramnegative pneumonia [15] . Long intravascular lines, indwelling bladder catheters and abdominal or thoracic drains further increase the potential for secondary infection, often with \"multi-resistant\" Gram-negative bacteria and staphylococci [16, 171 . Septicaemia, hypovolaemia, hypoxaemia, acidaemia and DIC with renal failure creates problems with drug handling, especially if the patient is oliguric or receiving haemodialysis. This is especially important with aminoglycoside therapy [18, 19] . The potential for deleterious drug-induced sequelae is obvious and, without regular measurement of peak and trough levels, underdosing may result with significant decrease in the likelihood of successful treatment [20] .",

Wide variation occurs in the half life of the aminoglycosides in elderly patients, those with renal dysfunction and even there where is apparently normal renal function [26, 27] . In some of these latter patients the half life may be as long as 6-8 h. Regular monitoring of serum peak and trough levels is therefore mandatory [28, 291 . The peak serum level should be taken one hour after IV dosing and the trough immediately prior to the next dose. The peak level for gentamicin should be in the range 6-10 mg/1 and that for netilmicin in the range 12-15 mg/1. Trough levels should not exceed 1.5 to 2 mg/1 and 2 to 3 mg/1 respectively. Initial dosage for gentamicin should be 2.5-5mg/kg and netilmicin 5-7.5 mg/kg daily.

Once daily (OD) dosing with gentamicin and netilmicin is regarded as equally effective but less hazardous than conventional multiple daily (MDD) dosing and this therapeutic ploy is now being increasingly used [31] . To provide comprehensive broad-spectrum cover aminoglycosides are combined with semi-synthetic penicillins notably amoxicillin and piperacillin. Metronidazole is added to provide anti-anaerobic cover and flucloxacillin where there is S. aureus infection. These combinations are widely employed in intensive care and usually prove efficacious. Gentamicin-resistant strains of the nosocomial opportunistic Gram-negative bacteria have appeared, however, but are generally sensitive to netilmicin or amikacin. Gentamicin is removed by haemodialysis and the drug should be given post-dialysis in a dose of 1.5-2 mg/kg body weight with close monitoring of serum level. Patients with hepatic disease are particularly prone to develop gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Drug interactions need to be borne in mind -notably with diuretics, and aminoglycosides should never be mixed with other antimicrobials but always given individually. Hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon but neuromuscular blockade and neurological sequelae occasionally arise.",

Cefoxitin, a cephamycin, provides some anti-anaerobic cover, is relatively stable to beta-lactamases and is active against ampicillin-resistant coliforms, but the drug has not found broad favour in Europe. The newer cephalosporins are not nephrotoxic but their half life is stretched by renal dysfunction.

S245 Ceftazidime, a third-generation parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity -notably against Ps. aeruginosa and \"multi-resistant\" Gram-negative opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens, does not provide anti-anaerobic cover. The MIC against S. aureus is high (MIC 2-8 mg/1) but the drug has been widely researched in patients with severe sepsis, where it has proved efficacious as monotherapy [8] . It has also been successfully employed as monotherapy in the ITU setting [32, 33] . Side effects are few and the drug can be safely combined with metronidazole, flucloxacillin or aminoglycosides. It is not nephrotoxic and side effects are few. Bleeding does not occur with the drug and pseudomembranous colitis and overgrowth syndromes are uncommon. In-treatment resistance can develop, notably to Enterobacter spp. The low protein binding of the drug makes for excellent tissue penetration and ceftazidime in a dose of 2 g t. i. d. is regarded as an important tool in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalised patients [7] .",

In this setting few clinicians would use monotherapy. Occasionally monotherapy may be directed against a known sensitive pathogen, e.g., ceftazidime or imipenem/cilastatin or aztreonam. The various drugs currently used in ITU have, however, been briefly described and some newer agents for potential use in the ITU considered. In current practice, however, antimicrobials with a proven \"track-record\" continue to be used by clinicians, the search being for safer use in this difficult group of patients.",
