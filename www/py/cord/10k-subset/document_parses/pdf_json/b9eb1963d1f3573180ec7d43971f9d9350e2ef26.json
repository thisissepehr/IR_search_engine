            "text": "THE photoreceptor G protein, transducin, is one of the class of heterotrimeric G proteins that mediates between membrane receptors and intracellular enzymes or ion channels. Light-actil'ated rhodopsin catalyses the exchange of GDP for GTP on multiple transducin molecules. Activated transducin then stimulates cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase by releasing an inhibitory action of the phosphodiesterase 'Y-subunits. This leads to a decrease in cGMP levels in the rod, and closure of plasma membrane cationic channels gated by cGMp l -4. In this and other systems, turn-off of the response requires the GTP bound to G protein to be hydrolysed by an intrinsic GTPase activity5--7. Here we report that the interaction of transducin with cGMP phosphodiesterase, specifically with its 'Y-subunits, accelerates GTPase activity by several fold. Thus the 'Y-subunits of the phosphodiesterase serve a function analogous to the GTPase-activating proteins that regulate the class of small GTP-binding proteins. The acceleration can be partially suppressed by cGMP, most probably through the non-catalytic cGMP-binding sites of phosphodiesterase a and fl-subunits. This cGMP regulation may function in light-adaptation of the photoresponse as a negative feedback that decreases the lifetime of activated cGMP phosphodiesterase as light causes decreases in cytoplasmic cGMP.",

Purity was >98%. fast termination of PDE activation observed under similar conditions 20 . More recent work indicates that transducin GTPase can be faster under more physiologial conditions 11,21-23, but the mechanism of GTPase acceleration has remained unclear. The data of Fig. 1 show that PDE itself serves as a GTPase-activating factor. The maximal GTPase rate observed in this reconstitution study (-0.15 S-I) is still about lO-fold slower than the rate of the recovery from a photoresponse. But a more rapid rate (> 0.6 s -I) is observed in suspensions of disrupted rod outer segments l2 for the fast component of GTPase suppressed by micromolar concentrations of cGMP. Our study allows us to conclude that this faster GTPase is a property of that transducin which activates PDE, and thus the extent of PDE-dependent GTPase acceleration is higher in rod outer segment suspensions than in reconstituted membranes. More recent data (V. Y.A. et al., manuscript in preparation) shows that further concentration of rod outer segment suspensions (> 100 fLM rhodopsin) increases GTPase rates by at least twofold, close to the turn-off time of the photoresponse. The data shown in Fig. 2 indicate a feedback mechanism in retinal rods based on cGMP-dependent regulation of the lifetime of activated PDE. Such a mechanism might function during rod background adaptation, when the duration and light sensitivity of the photoresponse is diminished 24 ,25. A reasonable model is that background light depletes intracellular cGMP levels, causing dissociation of cGMP from the non-catalytic binding sites on PDE. This would accelerate the GTPase activity that terminates each PDE activation event, leading to a faster and/or smaller photoresponse. Such a mechanism might work in parallel with the known calcium feedback regulation of adaptation 4 \u2022 The regulation of GTP-binding protein GTPase activity by an effector described here, although not previously described for a heterotrimeric G protein, has been documented extensively for several other classes of GTP-binding proteins (for example ref. 26) . It is observed for elongation and initiation factors whose GTPase activity is enhanced by ribosomes. The class of small GTP-binding proteins including the product of proto-oncogene ras interact with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that may also be their effectors 27 . The intrinsic GTPase of the heterotrimeric signal-transducing G proteins is considerably more rapid than that of the small GTP-binding proteins (for example refs 5-7), but still in several systems such as photoreception 2 ,3, 0lfaction 28 and muscarinic receptor-induced potassium channel regulation 29 CORONA VIRUSES, like many animal viruses, are characterized by a restricted host range and tissue tropism 1.

Here we report that aminopeptidase N, an ectoenzyme abundantly expressed at the apical membrane of the enterocytes, serves as a receptor for TGEV. Monoclonal antibodies were selected for their ability to block infection by TGEV of porcine cell lines.

Subsaturating concentrations of PDE (0.2 fLM) and PDE y (0.4 fLM) which caused the same extent of GTPase acceleration were used. cGMP was added at a saturating concentration of lOOfLM where indicated. To prevent cGMP hydrolysis by PDE during the experiment the PDE inhibitor Zaprinast (100 fLM; May & Baker) was added to all samples. Zaprinast itself did not influence the GTPase reaction (not shown). All the data are taken from one of three similar experiments and approximated by single exponents revealing GTPase rates of 0.031 S-l for test membranes alone, 0.063 S-l for the membranes in the presence of both PDE and cGMP and 0.13 S-l for all other conditions.",
