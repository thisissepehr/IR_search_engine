By further immunoinformatic analyses for enhanced vaccine efficacy, we selected the 18-most promising epitopes, which were joined together using molecular linkers to create a multivalent recombinant protein against Candida albicans (mvPC). To increase mvPC's immunogenicity, we added a synthetic adjuvant (RS09) to the mvPC design. The selected mvPC epitopes are homologous against all currently available annotated reference sequences of 22 C. albicans strains, thus offering a higher coverage and greater protective response.

Increasing frequency of the pre-disposing risk factors has led to a remarkable 20-fold higher incidence of IC in just two decades 2 . However, unlike other fungal infections, IC is usually due to an endogenous candida overgrowth at mucosal surfaces (mucosal candidiasis) 3 . Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most common etiological agent of IC and is found in ~ 60% of clinical isolates of candidiasis 4 . In healthy individuals, C. albicans co-exists with the host in a harmless commensal (yeast) form without causing disease 5 . However, certain underlying conditions (e.g., major surgery, broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, immunodeficiency diseases [AIDS, diabetes, cancer chemotherapy, etc.], or even premature birth) can cause candida to become pathogenic 6 . The pathogenesis of candida requires a switch from its commensal yeast form to a pathogenic fungal (hyphal) form 5 . The presence of hyphae enables candida to cause widespread damage to the underlying tissues. If the infection remains unchecked, candida can gain access to the host vasculature 5 . Once candida enters the bloodstream, it can spread throughout the body, causing life-threatening IC with a high mortality rate of 60% 7 . The current treatment with a limited set of available drugs leads to high drug-induced systemic toxicity and is associated with an increased emergence of anti-fungal-resistant candida species 2 .

So far, the multivalent-vaccine approach has not been adopted against C. albicans. Due to the complex nature of candida antigens and its ability to escape host-immune surveillance, a multi-epitope vaccine will likely be more beneficial in inducing a stronger and broader immune responses 15, 16 .

Using web-based servers, we screened the entire candida proteome (consisting of 6030 proteins), to identify the most immunodominant candida antigens. Of note, our immunogenicity analyses focused on identifying epitopes in the hyphal proteins, which help candida adhere to and invade epithelial cells, resulting in severe damage to the host cells 5 . Thus, targeting hyphae will preserve candida's yeast form without affecting host-fungal commensalism. Eight antigenic proteins with known functions in hyphal formation (Als4p, Als3p, Fav2p, Als2p, Eap1p, Hyr1p, Hwp1p, Sap2p) were selected further for epitope mapping (Table 1) . Immunogenicity testing led to the selection of 18 unique epitopes [10 CD4 + T-helper or Th (15mer), 7 B-cell (20mer) and 1 CD8 + T-cytotoxic or Tc (9mer)]. The rationale for selecting these epitopes lies in the significance of Th cells in recognizing HLA class II proteins and in turn activating both B-cells to secrete antibodies and activating Tc cells to kill infected target cells 51 . Antibody response to C. albicans is ideal to target carbohydrate moieties on the fungal cell wall, as well as some secreted proteins (secreted aspartyl proteinase or SAP 52 ) and has been shown to be effective in providing resistance against IC 53 . Although Tc play a minor role in natural immunological defense against candida and have not been studied much, previous studies show that Tc are effective in controlling fungal infection post-vaccination [54] [55] [56] . Therefore, a combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses is likely to confer an effective immune response against pathogenic candida. Conservancy analysis also show that the selected epitopes (in addition to the eight hyphal proteins), are also present in other candida proteins showing sequence homology (Sap1p, Sap 3p and Als1p, Table 2 ). Further, while designing the mvPC vaccine we have not only identified immunodominant epitopes in the antigenic proteins of the reference strain but also checked their conservancy across all known 22 strains of C. albicans whose proteome sequences are available in NCBI. Our selected antigens are in the highly-conserved regions of the candida proteome, offering protection against the 22 currently known candida strains. Selection of conserved candida epitopes also minimizes the chances of mutation in all the conserved regions simultaneously, limiting the emergence of new-resistant candida species. The selected epitopes also show conservation (a.k.a immunoprotection) with other pathogenic candida species (C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, and C. orthopsilosis). Lastly, selected epitopes show HLA binding affinity in all 27 reference alleles of HLA class II with a number of epitopes demonstrating binding ability with multiple HLA subtypes. The presence of RS09 (via activation of the TLR4 signalling pathway) is expected to boost anti-candida immune response by skewing Th response towards the Th17 subtype which plays a major role in mounting an immune response in clearance of pathogenic C. albicans 57,58 . RS09 has previously been shown to provide better adjuvanticity with fewer side effects in HIV-1 59 . Figure 3 . mvPC 3D-structure generated using Galaxy refine server.
