Transcriptome analysis, and subsequent validation ELISA assays, revealed that excess GM-CSF re-directs macrophages from an \"M1-like\" to a more \"M2-like\" activation state as revealed by alterations in the ratios of CXCL9 and CCL17 in BAL fluid, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis predicted that GM-CSF surplus during IAV infection elicits expression of anti-inflammatory mediators and moderates M1 macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling by Type II interferon (IFN-\u03b3). Conclusions: Our data indicate that application of high levels of GM-CSF in the lung after influenza A virus infection alters pathogenic \"M1-like\" macrophage inflammation.

This combination can lead to an ARDS-like syndrome characterized by increased capillary leak, oxygen diffusion difficulty and ventilation/perfusion mismatch [1] . Immune strategies that protect the host's lung function while still allowing for an adequate immune response to clear the viral load and resolve virus-induced pneumonia are needed.

In this study we use a more clinically relevant model to examine whether supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF in the airways, induced after IAV infection at the peak of virus replication, provided therapeutic benefit. Using GM-CSF-inducible mice on the WT C57BL/6 genetic background we show that airway GM-CSF over-expression starting at 3 days post infection (dpi) provides protection from mortality and prevents the degeneration of multiple lung mechanical properties. To examine the mechanism of protection conferred by therapeutic GM-CSF levels, we measured respiratory and biochemical parameters of lower airway disease, and analyzed the transcriptome of FACS-sorted AMs and exudative macrophages (EM) from IAV-infected mice. Our findings demonstrate that GM-CSF restores proteostasis of exudate proteins and redirects responsiveness of AMs and EMs from an M1-like to an M2-like activation state, and prevents mortality from influenza-induced ARDS.",

Littermate control (LM) mice were defined as being single transgenic littermates of DTGM mice that were only positive for the SCGB1A1-rTA and thereby did not have the CMV-GM-CSF gene, which may potentially be virally induced in the absence of tetracycline (doxycycline) [7] . DTGM mice and LM controls were exposed to 1 mg/mL doxycycline in drinking water, and doxycycline-containing drinking water was replenished every 2-3 days. Both male and female mice were used for all experiments; all mice were sex-and age-matched to control mice. The influenza strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus was a kind gift of Dr. Kevan Hartshorn, and was grown in the chorio-allantoic fluid of ten (10) day old specific pathogen free avian supplies (SPAFAS) chicken eggs purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as previously described [8] . Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and intranasally (i.n.) infected with IAV virus in 40 \u03bcL of PBS. Mice were infected in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet and housed within filter-top microisolator cages in the Pulmonary Immunology and Physiology (PIP) core, a BSL2 facility in the Department of Comparative Medicine's animal facility at Penn State University College of Medicine. Mice were observed at least twice daily during infections to assess morbidity and mortality. Based on our experience at our facility in the last 2 years and the variable clinical presentation of the influenza infection, we used other metrics to monitor morbidity in addition to mouse body weight curves [9] . Mice that exhibited immobility, ruffled hair, and labored breathing that had no chance of recovery, coinciding with approximately 30% of body weight loss, were euthanized by ketamine/xylazine overdose and cervical dislocation, and counted as dead. Alternatively, mice that were sleeping but had normal breathing and body appearance, i.e., no ruffled hair or labored breathing, reached up to 35-40% body weight loss and then began to recover normally. Mice with favorable prognosis but with 30% body weight loss or greater were provided supportive care with food and hydrated gel packs at the bottom of the cage. We have not found a pattern of clinical disease specific to mouse genotype or gender in untreated mice.",

Importantly, in the absence of infection, BAL fluid levels of GM-CSF in DTGM mice are near the limit of detection, similar to littermate controls (Additional file 4: Figure S2a ), and their alveolar macrophages appear identical by multiparameter flow cytometry. Once doxycycline is administered, BAL levels of GM-CSF peak after approximately 48 h reaching levels of approximately 500 pg/mL in 2.5 mL of recovered BAL fluid and in preliminary experiments the DTGM mice were either administered or not administered doxycycline to create a condition of elevated vs. wild-type levels of airway GM-CSF, respectively [4] . However, these preliminary experiments demonstrated that low levels of GM-CSF from the Scgb1a1 promoter in DTGM mice were endogenously induced by interferons during IAV infection (Additional file 4: Figure S2A ), a finding that has previously been reported [15] . Therefore, all subsequent experiments compared the DTGM to LM groups, both exposed to doxycycline, to examine the effect of elevated (DTGM) as opposed to wild-type (LM) levels of airway GM-CSF, while also controlling for any off-targets effects of doxycycline.",

GM-CSF overexpression (DTGM) conferred a significant survival advantage as compared to wild-type levels (LM, Fig. 1b , **p < 0.005). Weight loss and recovery were similar in the two groups, however, because of survivor bias likely artificially elevating the average weights of surviving LM mice (Fig. 1c) .

As surrogate of alveolar fluid content, we measured the concentration of total protein in BAL fluid and found that GM-CSF overexpression decreased BAL fluid total protein levels at 10 (peak inflammation) and 14 dpi (early resolution phase) (Fig. 3a) . To further investigate this difference in BAL fluid protein content, we examined the concentration of various serum and lung-specific proteins including mouse serum albumin (69 kDa), as well as two larger proteins, alpha-2-macroglobulin (180 kDa monomer, 720 kDa tetramer) and immunoglobulin M (IgM, 194 kDa monomer, 970 kDa pentamer) as markers of capillary leak [20] . GM-CSF significantly decreased alpha-2macroglobulin levels at 14 dpi (Fig. 3b) , but did not significantly decrease other markers of capillary leak including albumin or IgM (Additional file 5: Figure S3A-B) . We also directly assayed the lung epithelial barrier function with FITC-labeled dextran (MW 10,000), but surprisingly no differences in epithelial barrier function could be detected at 10 dpi (data not shown).",

GM-CSF is known to mediate the proliferation and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages; studies using constitutive expression or GM-CSF administration before IAV infection models both documented an increase in AM numbers [5, 6, 28] . Therefore we hypothesized that GM-CSF would protect SiglecF + AMs from viral-induced depletion and would increase numbers of total airway (BAL-recovered) macrophages. To investigate this immune cells were characterized and enumerated in single cell suspensions of BAL and lung enzymatic digests by multi-parameter flow cytometry using a 12-color panel of macrophage and granulocyte surface markers (Fig. 4a) . We specifically focused on the two predominant airway macrophage populations present during active IAV infection: F4/80 + , CD11b neg/dim , SiglecF + cells to discriminate alveolar macrophages (AMs) and F4/80 + , CD11b + , SiglecF neg/dim cells that have been termed exudative macrophages (EMs) [29] . Our typical yield of AMs recovered from BAL fluid of an uninfected mouse is approximately 600,000 cells. At 10dpi, at the height of the inflammatory response to IAV, the number of AMs To simulate a therapeutic model of GM-CSF administration doxycycline was administered to both DTGM and LM control mice starting 3 days after i.n. infection with PR8 IAV. Doxycycline-containing water was protected from light and changed every three days (a). DTGM (n = 23, red circles/lines) and LM control (n = 15, black squares/lines) mice were administered approximately 2 LD 50 of IAV PR8 virus i.n. and administered doxycycline in water starting on +3 dpi, and the effects on survival and body weight are shown. Mice were euthanized if they lost >30% body weight and were moribund. GM-CSF over-expression (DTGM mice) conferred a significant survival benefit (b) but not a significant effect on weight loss/recovery (c) as compared to wild-type levels (LM mice). Results shown represent three independent experiments (**p < 0.005) recovered was much lower, and GM-CSF overexpression did not serve to increase this number (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, EMs become the predominant airway macrophage during IAV infection at this time point, but again, GM-CSF overexpression did not affect EM cell numbers (Fig. 4b) .",

            "text": "While GM-CSF overexpression did not change the number of macrophages, we hypothesized that it changed their phenotype. This is not a new concept as the primary function of GM-CSF on AMs is to induce differentiation and activation [4, 30, 31] . Despite attempting to discriminate the macrophage populations by multiple cell surface markers, we could not distinguish the IAV-responding macrophages further than alveolar and exudative macrophages as described in Fig. 4a . Therefore, we sought to determine whether GM-CSF affected the transcriptomes of the AM and EM populations independently by first FACS-sorting the airway macrophages. FACS-sorted airway macrophages from BAL fluid were obtained at 8 dpi, the time point where the survival curves of the DTGM and LM mice begin to diverge, and next generation RNAsequencing was performed on the sorted AM and EM populations. Using an unbiased approach, we identified the transcripts that were significantly affected by GM-CSF over-expression during IAV infection by comparing the mean value of each transcript from the DTGM and LM groups. For direct comparisons, transcripts that had a mean value of zero (0) FKPM in one of the groups were not analyzed. Of the 43,628 genes available in the reference genome, in the AM population 23 transcripts were significantly different between the groups with GM-CSF over-expression leading to up-regulation of the chemokines Ccl17, Cxcl3, and CCL6, and the down-regulation of Cxcl9, and Arg1, the prototypic marker of M2 macrophage polarization (Fig. 5a) [32] . In comparison to AMs, in EMs GM-CSF induced more transcripts than it inhibited. Only Fig. 4 Flow cytometric discrimination of alveolar and exudative macrophages by surface marker expression. Representative FACS plots from an IAV-infected LM mouse at 10 dpi, which detail our 12-color flow cytometry gating strategy of single cell suspensions from BAL and enzyme-digested lung (a). Alveolar macrophages (AM) were designated as F4/80 + SiglecF + CD11b neg/dim , whereas exudative macrophages (EM) were designated as F4/ 80 + SiglecF neg/dim CD11b+. Supra-physiologic GM-CSF levels during IAV infection had no effect on the absolute number of either airway (BAL-recovered) AM or EM cell numbers at 10 dpi (b) six transcripts were down regulated by GM-CSF including Lipg, Cxcl10 and Ccl12, while GM-CSF overexpression induced multiple transcripts in EMs including Dcstamp, Retnla, Irgc1, Mmp12, and Ccl6 (Fig. 5b) . Our unbiased analysis demonstrated that GM-CSF overexpression during IAV led to the up-regulation of some transcripts associated with M2 macrophages including matrix metalloprotease 12, MMP12, and CCL17, and the down-regulation of some M1 macrophage-associated transcripts such as CXCL9 and CXCL10. Therefore we examined the effect of GM-CSF on multiple canonical and novel macrophage polarization markers [33] . Interestingly, while GM-CSF tended to down-regulate M1 transcripts and up-regulate M2 transcripts, this effect was not absolute in either AMs or EMs (Fig. 5c-f ).",

The effect of supraphysiologic GM-CSF levels on each of the 43,628 sequenced macrophage genes was examined: differential gene expression was determined using with transcripts having a q-value <0.2 being included.

            "text": "In this study we examined the effect of elevated GM-CSF levels during IAV infection on clinical, lung physiologic and biochemical markers in a mouse model, and then used RNA-sequencing to ascertain the differential effects of elevated GM-CSF levels on the transcriptomes of the two predominant airway macrophages present during the peak of IAV infection. Our finding that elevation of airway GM-CSF during active IAV infection confers protection from mortality from IAV is novel. Multiple preclinical mouse studies have described the observations that the absence of GM-CSF increases susceptibility to IAV [3, 4, 25] , while supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF achieved by constitutive overexpression or exogenous administration are beneficial [5, 6, 28] . Importantly, however, the publications that have demonstrated positive effects of supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF against IAV infection have used either constitutive expression models [3] [4] [5] or have administered GM-CSF either before [6, 28] or on the day of infection [5] . To our knowledge this is the first description of the use of a therapeutic model of GM-CSF wherein it is \"administered\" to the airways well after establishment of the infection (+3 dpi) and still confers protection. Table 1 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predictions of the effects of supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF on airway macrophages during IAV. BAL airway macrophages were sorted and RNA-sequencing was performed to compare the gene expression between IAV-infected LM (n = 5 mice) and DTGM (n = 5 mice) treated with doxycycline at 8 dpi. Using the means of each group, the 5% (2181 genes) most expressed transcripts from each of the genotypes, DTGM and LM, were analyzed using Qiagen's Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA was used to identify differential upstream regulators between AMs (A) and EMs (B) of DTGM and LM mice, and upstream regulators were included in the table if their p-value of overlap was <1E-10 and the activation z-score was < \u22122 or > +2. IPA was also used to identify differential effects of GM-CSF on canonical pathways of AMs (C) and EMs (D). Ingenuity canonical pathways were included in the table if their -log(p-value) was >10 and the z-score of pathway activation was < \u22122 or > +2 GM-CSF over-expression led to an increase in macrophage expression and BAL fluid levels of CCL17 and MMP12, whereas a decrease in CXCL9 or monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG). These protein data, in addition to our macrophage transcriptome data, suggest that high levels of GM-CSF push the typically classically activated M1-like monocytes/macrophages in the lung during IAV towards an M2-like phenotype. Interestingly, a recent investigation showed that the presence of M1-like monocytes are a major determinant of IAV pathogenicity in patients and strengthened this notion with a mouse model demonstrating that adoptive transfer of M2 as opposed to M1 macrophages results in better outcomes [34] . The observation that GM-CSF is pushing macrophages towards an M2-phenotype is in stark contrast to a large body of in vitro literature that defines M1 monocytes/macrophages as being induced by GM-CSF, whereas M2 monocytes/macrophages are differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) [35] [36] [37] . On the other hand, alveolar macrophages from GM-CSF-deficient csf2\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a mixed M1/M2 phenotype, not a strictly M2 phenotype as in vitro data would suggest [38] . And our data also suggests that the polarization was not at all absolute: e.g., in AMs, GM-CSF led to lower transcript levels of the prototypic M2 macrophage marker, Arg1 (Fig. 5a) . Thus, while the M1/M2 macrophage polarization schema has been helpful [39, 40] , perhaps a more nuanced view of macrophage polarization [41] , where their intrinsic differentiation plasticity allows them to attend to specific needs of their local immune environment [42] , could explain these results. IPA also predicted the activation of the IL-10 receptor alpha-chain in both AMs and EMs. Given that IL-10 levels in BAL fluid were not elevated in DTGM as compared WT mice (Additional file 6: Figure S4D ), it is possible that GM-CSF overexpressing during IAV somehow potentiates IL-10 signaling in the lung microenvironment.",

While it has been shown using IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 and IFNGR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that interferon signaling is necessary for protection from IAV [43] , it is possible that this requirement only extends to epithelial cells. Interferon-\u03b3 may not be necessary during IAV infection and may in fact be detrimental, e.g., nitrogen oxide synthase 2 deficient (NOS2\u2212/\u2212) mice are more protected from IAV [44] , and Sun and Metzger demonstrated that treatment with an anti-IFN\u03b3 mAb clone XMG1.2 had little effect on the course of the viral infection, but inactivation of IFN-\u03b3 protected against secondary bacterial pneumonia [45] . Recently, Califano et al. showed that IFN\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice on both the Balb/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds demonstrated improved survival to lethal IAV infection [34] . In their model, IFN\u03b3 serves to restrict protective innate lymphoid cell group 2 (ILC2) function, whose production of IL-5 and amphiregulin may improve lung barrier function. Another group has also demonstrated that GM-CSF can induce amphiregulin in a smoke model of COPD followed by IAV infection [46] , however our data (Fig. 3c) suggest that pretreatment with GM-CSF is necessary for this effect on amphiregulin levels. Furthermore, our GM-CSF over-expression is started after IAV infection, amphiregulin levels at 10 dpi were not different in GM-CSF over-expressing mice, and therefore amphiregulin is likely not an active player in our model. It is possible that our inducible GM-CSF model may be replenishing GM-CSF that otherwise would be produced by ILC2s whose functions have been restricted by IFN\u03b3 [34] .",

            "text": "Our data suggest that high levels of GM-CSF inhibit interferon signaling in airway macrophages, though the mechanism is not clear. Canonically, GM-CSF signaling acts through JAK2/STAT5 [47] , though the beta-chain itself can activate NF-kB, and this activation is dependent on TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [48, 49] , an E3 ubiquitin ligase with multiple immune functions [50] . Interestingly, our upstream analysis predicts that GM-CSF activates TRIM24, (aka TIF1\u03b1), a negative regulator of interferon signaling that acts by binding the retinoic acidresponsive element of the Stat1 promoter [51] , thus inactivating multiple interferon pathways. TRIM24 is also an E3-ubiquitin ligase, and the tumor suppressor protein, p53, serves as a ligand for both ligases: TRIM24 targets p53 for degradation [52] while TRAF6 restricts p53 mitochondrial translocation [53] . Furthermore, a recent microarray study examining the relative pathogenicity of a mouse adapted strain of IAV (MA-CA/04) described negative inhibition of TRIM24 and early sustained interferon responses as important factors [54] . However, we detected only very low levels of Trim24 transcripts in our sorted airway macrophages, but GM-CSF over-expression did lead to increased expression of another TRIM family member, Trim16, that also acts as a E3 ubiquitin ligase that can heterodimerize with other TRIMs [55] . Future studies are needed to determine the exact cellular signaling pathways linking GM-CSF and interferon.",

However, it may also regulate acute inflammatory responses by proteolysis of chemokines [57] , and through its divergent effects on IFN-\u03b1 signaling depending on its intracellular (activating) vs. extracellular (inactivating) localization [58] . A recent report demonstrated in two separate mouse models inflammation (peritonitis and arthritis) that macrophages resolve inflammation through multiple mechanisms via MMP12 including dampening neutrophil infiltration, clearing actin and fibrin from NETs, terminating complement activation, and by activating prothrombin thus exhibiting procoagulant activity [59] . CD4+ T cells and STAT4/6, at least in a mouse model of pneumocystis pneumonia, are necessary for M2 macrophage MMP12 expression and RELM-\u03b1 and CCL17 production [60] . While our data suggest that GM-CSF may block M1-like polarization in the lung during IAV infection, it is not yet clear what in the lung microenvironment could promote M2-like macrophage responses. Recently it was shown that macrophage polarization may be pushed towards a IL-4 dependent pathway in the lung and liver by the presence of surfactant protein A (SP-A) and complement component C1q, respectively [61] . The relationship between supraphysiologic GM-CSF levels and SP-A during IAV infection remains to be investigated and will be the subject of future studies.",

The present study is not confounded by prior immaturity of AMs and defective surfactant catabolism, nor potential defects in migratory dendritic cell subsets, NK cells, and other myeloid cells outside the alveolar compartment in the lung and in other tissues of Csf2 \u2212/\u2212 mice [62] [63] [64] [65] , or disruption of GM-CSF secretion by immune and non-immune cells that may elaborate GM-CSF in response to infection. Studies in Csf2 \u2212/\u2212 /SPC-GM mice, in which T2AECs express high levels of GM-CSF constitutively, came to disparate conclusions as to the role of AMs, dendritic cells and epithelial cells [3, 5] in host resistance to IAV infection. However, the life-long overexpression of GM-CSF in the SPC-GM +/+ model results in non-physiological proliferation of both T2AEC cells and AMs [66] that obscures assessment of temporal responses to IAV. The SPC-GM +/+ model also illustrates that prolonged lung exposure to supraphysiologic levels of GM-CSF leads to desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) [4] . We did not observe any similar findings of DIP in our model, but this is not surprising given our model creates only a temporary doxycyclineinduced overxpression, and the overriding inflammatory effects of IAV infection likely masks any differences. In our model, the ability of supra-physiologic levels of GM-CSF to beneficially alter disease progression after IAV infection delineates a time frame for possible future therapeutic intervention to arrest development of acute lung injury. In this regard, administration of GM-CSF in humans has shown promise in the treatment of ARDS [67] . Concentration-dependent signaling via the GM-CSF receptor affecting differentiation, proliferation, activation, and function of different effector cells has been studied extensively [68] [69] [70] [71] .",
