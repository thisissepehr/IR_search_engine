The laboratory findings before and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in KD have been discussed, but the characteristics of IVIG therapy still are unclear. This study aimed to compare laboratory data from patients with KD and enterovirus (EV) infection to evaluate the differences after IVIG therapy. The study enrolled 171 KD patients and 38 EV patients treated with a single dose of IVIG from 2003 to 2010. Laboratory data including total white blood cell counts (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb), platelet, segment, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and monocyte levels were analyzed. Compared with the KD patients, the EV patients had higher Hb, lymphocyte, and monocyte levels and lower eosinophil levels before IVIG treatment (p \\ 0.05). After IVIG treatment, the KD patients had lower Hb and segment levels but higher platelet, lymphocyte, and eosinophil levels than the EV patients (p \\ 0.05).

The lower the IL-5 and eosinophil levels were after IVIG treatment, the higher the rate of CAL that was found [12] .

Therefore, it is interesting to consider whether the Th2 immune response (eosinophil, IL-5, IL-4, and eotaxin) results from the IVIG treatment or from the disease course of KD. We hypothesized that eosinophils in KD are a witness of the Th2 immune response due to the eosinophil positivity associated with the Th2 immune response (IL-5) but not with its activation marker (ECP).

Therefore, atopic diseases may develop in EV patients later in childhood, and further studies are warranted to elucidate this issue. Kuo et al. [9, 11] reported that IL-4, IL-5, and eosinophil levels are increased in KD patients. This suggests that KD tends to elicit a Th2 immune response and may be related to atopic disease development in late childhood. Levels of both Th1-and Th2-related cytokines are reported to be increased during the acute stage of KD including tumor necrosis factor-alpha [5] , IL-6, IL-8 [19] , IL-4 [2, 6, 12] , IL-5, eotaxin, and IL-10 [6] .
