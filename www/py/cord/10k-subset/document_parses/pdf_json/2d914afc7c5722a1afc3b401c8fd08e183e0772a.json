However, EIA did not comprehend fully health impacts derived from environmental aspects and HIA came to overcome it. The objective of this work was to analyze the association and economic impact of dengue cases near a hydroelectric construction area in Brazil. The methods presented a suggestive approach of HIA and included screening, scoping, appraisal of health impacts, economic valuation and recommendations. Rapid HIA was chosen and applied to dengue cases in Rondonia state, Brazil. Statistical analysis were performed by segmented regression followed by economic defensive expenditure method. The statistical analysis showed the construction of hydroelectric plants have contributed to increase the dengue cases in the state (p 0.05) and the annual average cost has increased from US$ 2,462,528 (after the construction) to US$ 6,621,543. The hydroelectric plants in Brazil, despite having severe impacts on the environment and health of the population, were approved and released for construction before the impacts were properly assessed, including economic evaluation of health impacts. In this sense, the incorporation of HIA within the EIA process could be useful in the health management.",

In order to teach our students to practice effectively within the burgeoning field of One Health, we employ an approach that involves multidisciplinary collaborative efforts to combine the experience and knowledge base of practitioners across the Allied Health fields in order to develop intellectual resources within our students as well as teach valuable skills in teamwork and communication. Through funding from the Tufts Innovates Program a grant that supports multidisciplinary enquiry and collaboration, we assembled a cadre of faculty and students from across the schools to identify areas of thematic importance to create a One Health community of educators and learners. The outcome is six multi-disciplinary One Health PBL cases used across the health sciences schools. Facilitator and student OHPBL guides will be revised, completed and availed on line and manually.",

Gender roles, the distribution of labor, access and control over resources play an important part in the biosecurity, control, prevention and response to infectious diseases. Therefore gender differences need to be addressed to respond effectively to public health threats. One Health Central and Eastern Africa (OHCEA), a network of 17 schools of Public health and veterinary medicine in Africa has identified Gender as a key One Health core competency. With this in mind, OHCEA set out to ensure that gender as a strategic concept is included as an analytical and planning tool across programs by creating a Gender and One health training program. The training applies gender analysis tools to disease surveillance, response, prevention and control mechanisms, engenders One Health skills and competencies, identifies gender gaps and develops gender sensitive indicators and policies to address those gaps. Trainings target in service personnel in multiple disciplines, the private sector and university faculty and students from OHCEA institutions. The end goal is to create a gender integration training curriculum that weaves the key principles of gender equality and gender analysis throughout OHCEA institutions.",

The current Commonwealth Government has again allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for investment in the development of northern Australia. Yet over the last one hundred and fifty years failed attempts have accumulated; from ambitious Texan entrepreneurs losing millions of dollars to Australian families walking off small farms to Indigenous Australians being even further marginalised. Despite investing millions of dollars in supporting agricultural development in northern Australia the huge region has countered the international trend of agriculture intensification. Many factors contribute to this, including social and environmental. More importantly it is the relationship between these factors that inhibit the growth of intensive agriculture, and hinder our capacity to learn from experience. This paper explores those factors and our need to better understand complex systems in our agricultural and policy contexts.",

Malaria transmission is now limited to remote forested regions, especially border areas, where the forest is a focus of legal and illegal economic activities. Often these areas are inhabited by ethnic minorities, who are traditionally dependent on slash and burn agriculture, requiring overnight stays at their farms located in the forest. In these remaining malaria hotspots, 'forest-going' is recognized as the major risk factor for malaria infection, however how 'forest-going' manifests as a risk behavior in the context of deforestation becomes more complex. Using a case study approach, based on extensive mixed-methods field research in three settings in Vietnam and Cambodia, the concept of the chronotone will be employed to demonstrate that transitions in livelihoods as the forest recedes can contribute to local malaria hotspots persisting, even as malaria incidence in the region declines. It will be argued that persistent malaria transmission is driven by shifting access to forest resources, and that the exposure risks associated with 'forest-going' are best understood at a social network rather than individual level.",

Our approach (currently implemented in 8 villages, >2,000 households) is based on a stepwise process of community engagement orientated around a grassroots network of ''Mosquito Police'' (Polisy Kont Moustik, in Creole) . This network conducts weekly larval surveillance and mobilizes their communities for a series of didactic behavior change activities, including environmental management, household modifications and community-wide visual arts competitions. This presentation will discuss how local culture, social norms, political dynamics and environmental conditions influenced our intervention and the scale-up process.

Indeed, global changes affecting biodiversity, water management and agricultural production may unexpectedly increase the risk of zoonotic and environmental diseases transmission, threatening food security, with devastating socioeconomic and wellbeing impacts for the poorest communities. Assessing and managing these risks implies taking into account socioecological dynamics, in link with epidemiological patterns and public-health policies. For instance, epidemiological surveillance of animal diseases has to involve economic costs and social impacts associated to disease reporting for the farmers. As zoonotic diseases' spreading can be largely induced by important ecological modifications, it implies to deeply understand eco-epidemiological systems involving pathogens and their reservoir, vectors and hosts. It requests a holistic approach to understand the relationship between ''Health'' and ''Agriculture'' within the socioecosystem's dynamics. It implies to underline the institutional constraints and potential coordination gaps across sectors and institutions and across action levels. Such integrative approach at the interface between ecosystems and societies cannot be achieved spontaneously, and implies methodological guidelines for cross-sectorial and interdisciplinary collaborations.",

This framework contributes to the broader goal of determining the risk of pathogen spillover at human, livestock and wildlife interfaces. The framework aims to collect a common core set of samples from livestock species (e.g. poultry, pigs and cattle) -at the same times and at the same locations -that wildlife samples are collected. Staff from PREDICT arrange and perform the wildlife sampling while the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) arranges the livestock sampling. FAO has close relationships in country with the counterpart Departments of Agriculture and it is this relationship which underpins the capacity for livestock sampling within this collaborative framework. This synchronized surveillance requires good collaboration and coordination between officers from FAO, Departments of Agriculture and PREDICT. Site selection, data collection, animal sampling, testing and information management system issues will be described using the experience of implementing the framework in Lao PDR during 2016 as an example. biological risk-based intervention approaches. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa has shown serious gaps in the public health system and the urgent need for a joint human and animal diseases surveillance-response system. In such environments, how do we introduce the One Health thinking at different scales of the health system? Transdisciplinary capacity in One Health thinking has the merit of achieving high health intervention impact during crisis, but it needs to be sustained with comprehensive socio-economic and cultural incentives. Building on the achievements of the consortium Afrique One, the new \u00ab African Science Partnership for Intervention Research Excellence \u00bb programme aspires to bring together leading institutions in One Health to develop research capacity and training for the next generation of scientists and practitioners facing ecosystem health, disease control and potential elimination challenges. This contribution shares success stories and challenges of how research-based knowledge of One Health can be transferred to different stakeholder groups in order to address common health problems and resilience patterns in the global South.",

            "text": "During 2014-2016 changes to patterns in detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Europe showed altered epidemiology affecting the performance of surveillance programmes. Incursion of a new lineage of H5 HPAI (clade 2.3.4.4) from East Asia caused multiple outbreaks in various poultry species and wild birds across six countries with an apparent reduction in mortality rates in domestic and wild waterfowl. This impacts the role and efficiency of scanning surveillance in poultry and surveillance of wild birds found dead. Significant antigenic variation was also observed on serological tests for this lineage of virus affecting test performance. Haemagglutination inhibition testing of sera from ducks with standard EU-recommended antigens suggested much lower sensitivity than when the homologous antigen was used. Results of a Bayesian analysis of these data will be presented. A separate outbreak of European lineage H5 virus in France affected over 90 farms with multiple Neuraminidase subtype combinations detected (H5N1, H5N2, H5N3 and H5N9). Infections were detected most often in domestic ducks, often in the absence of clinical signs of infection. The increasing availability and power of molecular epidemiology and genotyping has potential to rapidly inform on likely transmission pathways and identify strains or mutations of particular concern. Understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is crucial to inform spill-over risk, yet our understanding of these dynamics is frequently insufficient. A particular challenge is presented by viral infections in bats as host-pathogen interactions may differ from other mammals. We investigated viral persistence in a wild bat population by combining empirical data and in silico analyses to test hypotheses concerning methods of viral persistence. This study investigates a fatal zoonotic virus, European Bat Lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2), in the Daubenton's bat. A total of 1800 bats were sampled for evidence for antibody and virus excretion during a nine year serial cross-sectional survey. Multivariate statistical models demonstrated age-related differences in seroprevalence, with significant variation in seropositivity over time and between roosts. An approximate Bayesian computation approach was used to model the infection dynamics, under multiple scenarios incorporating the known host ecology. These results demonstrate that EBLV-2 is endemic in the study population, and suggest that seasonal mixing between roosts during swarming events is necessary to maintain EBLV-2 in the population. These findings contribute to understanding how bat viruses can persist despite low prevalence of infection, and why infections may be constrained to certain bat species in multispecies roosts and ecosystems.",

Most (320; 57.6%) were confirmed rabies cases, including dogs (40.6%), buffalo (29.7%) and cattle (23.1%). Of cases in dogs in which bite history was recorded, 50.7% had shown biting behaviour. Regression analysis of monthly cases in dogs showed seasonal variation with significant increases in March and August. Although monthly case numbers in buffalo decreased, no long-term temporal trend was detected in dog and cattle cases. Time-series models identified significant cross-correlations between dog and buffalo cases. Significant spatio-temporal clusters were not identified (SaTScan) and mean geographic centres of cases were stable (un-weighted and weighted by species and year). These results demonstrate that overall, the number of rabies cases in animals was temporally and spatially stable during 2004-2014.

As the global thirst for lumber, minerals and energy grows, an increasing amount of stress is placed on the land and its ability to sustain life. With multiple industries now operating adjacent to one another, the cumulative impacts of diverse land-use has become a significant area of scientific inquiry, and it is increasingly recognized that project-based environmental assessment is limited in its ability to capture the impacts of multiple land-uses. This paper reports on the state of the art of cumulative impact assessment in relation to policy developments in British Columbia, Canada. The paper then discusses a new research tool developed by the Cumulative Impacts Research Consortium in collaboration with rural and remote communities with long and storied histories of resource development. The tool is explicitly designed to address shortcomings in the environmental assessment process; to bolster third-party monitoring initiatives at the regional level by integrating environmental, community and health data into a historical understanding of cumulative impacts. Implications for utilizing data across scales and improving an understanding of health and its determinants as related to resource development are discussed.",

From a One Health perspective, policies and market are important components of the environment within which antibiotic usage in veterinary sector takes place. A scoping review was undertaken using the Arksey and O'Malley framework to identify the market and policy drivers of antibiotic use in smallholder periurban dairy farms. The process included: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; relevance screening; data charting; collating, summarizing, reporting the data; and expert consultation. Data was iteratively interpreted to develop a conceptual framework. Themes were grouped into three classes: market, farm and systems. Proximal drivers included adoption of intensive production norms, a preference for rearing high-yield exotic breeds in environments with poor hygiene and sanitation, with minimal infection control and biosecurity measures, causing high morbidity levels, necessitating higher antibiotic consumption. Distal drivers included market-level factors like urbanization, population growth, globalized markets, and changing food preferences. Systemic weaknesses, like the absence of antibiotic stewardship, monitoring frameworks, and surveillance and laboratory networks also drove higher antibiotic use. Farm-level antibiotic use is thus driven by a complex interplay of market, farm and systems-level factors needing One Health approach to address them.",

The following total aerobic counts and E. coli were recorded (respectively): freshwater steams (1.5 9 10 5 to 1.9 9 10 9 CFU/mL; >1.9 9 10 4 CFU/mL); cabbage (>3.0 9 10 4 CFU/mL; 2.0 9 10 3 CFU/ mL), tomatoes (5.5 9 10 3 CFU/mL; 1.3 9 10 2 CFU/mL), carrots (>3.0 9 10 4 CFU/mL; 2.3 9 10 3 CFU/mL), cucumber (1.6 9 10 3 CFU/mL; 2.9 9 10 2 CFU/mL), apples (3.9 9 10 2 CFU/mL; 0 CFU/mL), dust (2.0 9 10 3 CFU/mL; 1.2 9 10 2 CFU/ mL at vegetable markets and <3 9 10 0 CFU/mL 5 km away) (p = 0.002). All public freshwaters, ready-to-eat fruits (except apples), vegetables, and dust in the town had 'unsatisfactory microbial quality'. Upgrades to the town's wastewater treatment plants and better sanitation are urged for the town to contain diarrhoea.",

In some parts of Turkey, particularly in rural areas, wild edible plants are collected and used for home consumption or sold in local markets so wild edible plants are not only complementing people's diets but also representing an additional income for many households. Rural people in the Mediterranean Region use many wild plants for nutrition and health. With this study we explore some of these uses. Surveys and questionnaires targeting users, collectors and sellers in rural and urban markets for selected 20 plant taxa were undertaken. Local using procedures and intended uses were documented and plants were sampled for nutrient content analysis. 16 of these plants are commonly used for food while 4 are used for medicinal purposes. In conclusion using wild edible plants for both nutrition and health still plays an important role in rural areas, though knowledge of urban consumers is limited. Nowadays these kind of new choices foods attract attention in markets and this situation causes an ever-increasing livelihood for rural.",

Other ecological factors also influence I. scapularis and may play a role in population establishment. The objective of this study was to understand what abiotic and biotic factors are significant in the establishment of I. scapularis in Ontario. Tick dragging was conducted at 154 sites in Ontario during the months of May to October 2014 and 2015. Ecological and georeferenced data was collected for each site. Multi-variable mixed logistic regression models were created to assess the impact of the ecological factors on the presence of I. scapularis. Cumulative annual degree days was positively associated with the presence of I. scapularis, as well as the density of the understory, the presence of shrubs and the interaction of these two ecological factors. Elevation was negatively associated. These findings enhance our understanding of the factors contributing to I. scapularis population establishment, and can be used to enhance current predictive models and risks maps for I. scapularis.",

This has been largely driven by wild animal infection, primarily possums, an introduced pest into New Zealand which is also responsible for extensive flora and fauna damage. New Zealand has been able to control its bovine TB problem through the targeted control of these infected wild animal populations and at the same time achieve significant collateral benefit to flora and fauna protection. The New Zealand TB control strategy provides a working example of the convergence of human, animal and conservation medicine. This paper will describe the history of the introduction of mammals (wild and domestic) into New Zealand which has led to the establishment of a complex ecological and epidemiological web of bovine TB in man, domestic animals and particularly wildlife species. The same introductions have led to large scale destruction of native flora and fauna.

According to the agro-ecologic zoning for this palm, the plantations can occupy 31.8 million hectares of areas of supposed degraded land in Brazil. Based on official data, it has been estimated that around 332,000 litres of herbicides are annually applied in these crops, which are officially classified as lowimpact activities, with many of them immediately surrounding communities vulnerable to environmental changes. With an anthropological and ecotoxicological approach, we currently seek to comprehend this issue from an indigenous perspective, by analysing how this form of land-use by neighbouring local oil palm companies has been transforming their territories, and possibly affecting their livelihoods and well-being by disturbing the natural resources they rely on (e.g., freshwater availability and quality, biodiversity, hunting areas, among others).

Field 1 , Carlos Zambrana-Torrelio 1 , Erica Johnson and Allison White 1 EcoHealth Alliance 2 University of Wyoming 3 USAID RDMA Land use change is a key threat to conservation and public health, through the loss of tropical forest biodiversity and the emergence of known and novel diseases. Efforts to reduce deforestation have focused on estimating the value of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, pollination and other services from biodiversity, and incorporating these into land use planning. However, the economic drivers of deforestation and agricultural development often override conservation priorities. Here we describe a new economic modeling approach that explicitly accounts for the cost of disease outbreaks resulting from deforestation. First we show that accounting for the cost of malaria cases associated with land use change in Brazil halves the economic returns from land use change-more than double the impact of loss of ecosystem services. Secondly, we use detailed data on the costs of malaria and other infectious disease cases in Sabah, Malaysia, and ecosystem services valuations to demonstrate that forest conversion represents a net economic loss for the state. Spatial analysis provides potential for land use planning that can provide economic returns on logging and land conversion, reduce public health risk, and optimize conservation benefits. This approach holds the promise of harnessing government, community, and industry commitments to achieve reduced impact land use planning.",

In this talk I will lay out a growing body of work that allows us to understand, and even predict aspects of disease emergence -from where, from what species, and with what propensity to spread. I will then discuss three types of programs that may help us pre-empt future pandemics at source, or even before they emerge: 1) Pathogen discovery programs; 2) Capacity building programs targeted to the likely origins of future EIDs; and 3) Efforts to identify and reduce the underlying drivers of disease emergence (e.g. land use change, wildlife trade). All of these have significant challenges, significant gaps in our knowledge, and will incur significant cost. However, given the exponentially increasing drivers of disease emergence and the similarly increasing frequency of new EID events, I will demonstrate how these new programs are likely to provide significant return-on-investment.",

However, in many instances, the environment or ecosystems related discussion is not much more than an afterthought. Today we are living in the Anthropocene era, with human activities having unprecedented impacts on the state of the Earth's biophysical resource base and ecosystems; the prime risk factor in re-emerging 'old' and emerging new diseases. Demographic factors, land use, animal agriculture, and climate change are part of the changing disease landscape and in fact the root causes of these health threats, calling for a cohesive OneHealth approach. The current, interactive session will present various sets of circumstances encountered in a diverse collection of global hotspots. Attendees will be invited to react to the scenarios presented and challenge the panel regarding the options available to tackle the current instabilities and imbalances, in terms of direct disease flare-up as well as the through human action compromised resilience of the concerned planetary systems. Scavenging poultry transform environmental feed sources into highly nutritious foods for human consumption, of particular value for intrauterine and early postnatal growth and development. Current research is assessing the potential for vaccination programs against Newcastle disease in village chickens to contribute to sustainable improvements in children's nutrition. A total of 510 children <24 months of age from eight communities in a semi-arid area of Manyoni District, within the Rift Valley in central Tanzania, were randomly selected to participate in a cluster-randomised controlled trial beginning in May 2014. Sixmonthly data on health and nutrition, household characteristics and livestock ownership, and fortnightly data on chicken numbers and the occurrence of diarrhoea in children, were analysed jointly to assess their impact on height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ). Children from households owning chickens had significantly higher (improved) HAZ than those from households without chickens (-1.76 vs. -1.90; p = 0.03). Higher HAZ was also associated with improved toilet facilities (-1.67 vs -1.99; p = 0.02) and reduced incidence of diarrhoea (p = 0.004). Separate analysis found no association of diarrhoea in children with chicken ownership (p = 0.9), or with the practice of keeping chickens within human dwellings overnight (p = 0.2). These findings support the potential of poultry-based interventions to improve nutrition in resource-poor settings. The health of animals and people is a public good, which determines the amount of food, the labour force and well-being of the poorest rural communities. In socio-ecosystems where people coexist with pristine nature, development and conservation objectives need to be concurrently achieved. Health issues at the wildlife/livestock/human interface need to be addressed to mitigate the negative outcomes of these interactions. In parallel, the multi-sectorial dimension of the health issue can be used to trigger more interaction among stakeholders in these socio-ecosystems. Here, we present the Research Platform ''Production and Conservation in Partnership'', a collaboration between Zimbabwean and French Research institutions launched in 2007, implementing applied research to promote the coexistence between people and nature in Transfrontier Conservation Areas of southern Africa. The platform is currently expending regionally. The ''health & environment'' issue is one of the pillars of the platform. We present the community demand-driven, bottom-up applied research agenda that the platform is developing through a local and regional post-graduate training programme.

            "text": "The last ten years have seen a rapid expansion in One Health and EcoHealth; they have achieved this momentum on the thinnest of scientific ice often characterized by weak correlations and over confident specious mapping exercises. If OneHEalth is to truly emerge as a respectable scientific discipline it needs to more warmly embrace a deeper mechanistic understanding of how pathogens are naturally embedded in ecological communities and how disturbance to these systems leads to pathogen emergence. In this talk I'll make some quantitative estimates of levels of pathogen diversity in natural communities; essentially illustrating how trivial it should be to 'discover' new viruses. I'll provide an example of the factors that determine successful emergence and subsequent evolution in a well-studied avian pathogen, before concluding with an analysis of the current and future dynamics of Zika virus and its response to potential control methods. Wildlife play a critical role in emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases. Measures for their prevention, mitigation and early warning require surveillance of wildlife mortality and morbidity, knowledge of the populations at risk and of the changing character of wildlife disease agents. Until recently, Sri Lanka lacked a central wildlife disease surveillance program. The newly created Sri Lanka Wildlife Health Center (SLWHC) brings together ministries responsible for domestic animals, wildlife, human health and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science of the University of Peradeniya. A questionnaire survey conducted in 2015 and 2016 among field veterinarians, livestock development instructors and wildlife officers (n = 315), indicated that a lack of trained personnel (85%), inadequate knowledge on wildlife disease (80%), strict wildlife legislation (60%), lack of sample collection and storing facilities (95%), transportation (82%) and inadequate communication between partner institutes (52%) were constraints on wildlife disease surveillance. About 70% of field officers felt they needed additional training. The opportunities for improvement highlighted by the survey included firstly, willingness by 80% of respondents to participate in wildlife disease surveillance and secondly, the ability through the SLWHC, to improve communication between partners by providing infrastructure, deliver training programs and standardize sample collection, storage and submission. We quantified associations between antimicrobial use (AMU) and acquired resistance in indicator Escherichia coli over a decade (2004 to 2014) during drastic sector-wide antimicrobial use reductions (& 50%) in main livestock sectors (broilers, pigs, veal calves and dairy cattle) in the Netherlands. We used national data reported annually for the resistance surveillance and AMU program. Two multivariate random-effects logistic models per animal sector were used to relate total and classspecific AMU (as defined daily dosages/animal-year, DDDA/Y) with the probability of E. coli resistance to a panel of 10 antimicrobial agents. Positive dose-response relationships (statistically significant ORs between 1.02 to 1.40) were obtained from all models. In all sectors, total AMU was more associated with resistance phenotypes than class-specific AMU. Resistance to historically widely used antimicrobials (e.g. penicillins, tetracyclines) was, in relative terms, less influenced by AMU changes over time than resistance to newer or less prescribed antimicrobials (e.g. 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins). Thus, drug use history and co-resistance selection were shown as key elements for perpetuation of resistance. The most robust associations and positive prevalence predictions related to further AMU reductions were found in pigs and veal calves. The impact of Dutch policies on dairy cows and poultry was more modest. In 2008 joint initiatives by the Dutch Government, livestock sectors and the Royal Dutch Veterinary Association (KNMvD) resulted in a covenant describing measures for prudent use of antimicrobials in animals. The Netherlands Veterinary Medicines Authority (SDa) was founded to collect the antimicrobial usage (AMU) data of Dutch livestock, define benchmark targets for AMU in livestock, report annual trends and identify frequent prescribers or misusers. Reduction targets were set by the government at 20, 50 and 70% reduction in 2010, 2013 and 2015, respectively, with reference to 2009. Continuous monitoring of resistance in commensal E. coli had already been set up in livestock from 1998 onwards. The total reduction of AMU (in mass sold) between 2009 and 2015 was 58.4% and 65% reduction compared to 2007. The use of antimicrobials defined as ''critically important for human health'' (fluoroquinolones and 3 rd and 4 th generation cephalosporins) in livestock has been strongly reduced. As a result of the enforced 1-to-1 relationship of farmers and veterinarians, it was possible to develop the Veterinary Benchmark Indicator allowing to compare prescription levels between veterinarians. Parallel to reduction of AMU there was a reduction of AMR in livestock observed. Knowledge of Q fever in Thailand is limited. We reported a preliminary analyses of baseline data from a prospective cohort study among dairy cattle farms and farmers in Chiang Mai to describe the magnitude and factors associated with C. burnetii infection among farmers. Two stage random samplings of farms and farmers were performed in five dairy cooperatives. Face to face interview with farmers, and blood samples were collected for baseline assessment. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were collected from each farm and additional specimens were collected including cows' sera, swab from other animals, and farm environment from the farms with positive BTM. Farmers' sera were tested by Indirect Immunofluorescense Assay. BTM and cow sera were tested by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Other specimens were tested by polymerase chain reaction. Information of farms and farmers were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Generalized Estimating Equation. Among 637 randomly selected farmers, 532 participated (83.5%). The overall C. burnetii seroprevalence was 16.9% (90/532). Working in the farms with BTM positive (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.40-4.85), age (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.5), and having contact with cow's birth products (OR 1.95, 95% CI 0.98-3.90) were positively associated with the C. burnetii seropositivity. Health education regarding Q fever prevention to farmers was performed.",

This finding, if shown to be more generalised, has important implications, as traditionally seropositive status by itself has been used to associate wildlife species as zoonotic reservoirs. Rather our finding indicates that showing sero-positive status is ''necessary but not sufficient'' when identifying reservoirs, with viral excretion and plausible contact needing to be demonstrated to confirm reservoir status. The need to reassess other zoonotic diseases where multiple bat species have been suggested as reservoir hosts -including MERS-CoV and Ebola -are explored. In 2014, the first known henipavirus outbreak occurred in the Philippines, in which there were multiple human and horse fatalities. Post-outbreak investigations revealed the most likely routes of transmission for people were from exposure to infected fluids during the slaughter of sick horses, the handling of raw horse meat and very close contact with infected people. A follow-up study has since identified a number of additional possible risk factors for transmission of the virus in this cultural setting. These include the almost ubiquitous consumption of fresh coconut sap, and the high prevalence of consumption of fermented coconut sap (tuba). With collection methods similar to date palm sap, which has been found to contribute to Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh, these require further exploration as possible risk factors. Serological testing of pigs, horses and dogs was also conducted within the study area on the island of Mindanao. All sera tested negative for antibodies to Nipah virus, most likely indicating that the outbreak seen in 2014 was representative of rare spillover of the virus from the reservoir host to domestic animals and people. However, with inevitable encroachment on native ecosystems, these events may become more frequent.",

At the same time, development choices will alter underlying vulnerability to these risks, thereby affecting the magnitude and pattern of impacts. The current and projected human health risks of climate change are diverse and wide-ranging, potentially altering the burden of any health outcome sensitive to weather or climate. Climate variability and change can affect morbidity and mortality from extreme weather and climate events, and from changes in air quality arising from changing concentrations of ozone, particulate matter, or aeroallergens. Altering weather patterns and sea level rise also may facilitate changes in the geographic range, seasonality, and incidence of selected infectious diseases in some regions, such as malaria moving into highland areas in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Changes in water availability and agricultural productivity could affect undernutrition, particularly in parts of Asia and Africa. These risks are not independent, but will interact in complex ways with risks in other sectors. Policies and programs need to explicitly take climate change into account to facilitate sustainable and resilient societies that effectively prepare for, manage, and recover from climate-related hazards.",

Because in North Cameroon onchocerciasis incidence and transmission has been lower on a highland focus with intense cattle farming compared to an adjacent endemic lowland focus, it has been hypothesized transmission to man is reduced by the presence of animal-borne Onchocerca spp. transmitted by the same vector, a phenomenon called zooprophylaxis. Here we investigated the impact of zooprophylaxis in the very same two foci where vector transmission rates have been surveyed since decades. Microscopic species discrimination of the Onchocerca species was complemented with single-stranded conformation polymorphisms of amplified 16S rRNA sequences to assign unambiguously the species, final host and phylogenetic relationship of nearly all isolated L3's. O. volvulus transmission still prevails in the lowland focus after 29 years of ivermectin treatment, albeit drastically reduced to 3.5% of baseline. The proportion of animal-borne Onchocerca spp. was 95%. The endemic focus on the highland focus had only bovine Onchocerca spp. in the vector population as soon as 12 years after mass treatment introduction. This clearly demonstrates zooprophylaxis supplements disease control efforts up to the regional interruption of O. volvulus transmission.",

In response, the purpose of this presentation is to highlight place-specific approaches to protecting/enhancing farmers' mental health and wellbeing in the context of abrupt climate change. The presentation draws upon a qualitative community-based case study located in the Western Australian Wheatbelt that sought to understand climate change impacts on family farmers' sense of place and mental wellbeing. The research findings indicate that farmers' sense of place is a significant determinant of farmers' psychological wellbeing, and that interventions that enhance farmers' place-based attachments and identities may deliver cobenefits for community and farmland health. Specific interventions discussed include: 1) negotiating the 'home-work tension', 2) cultural awareness training for new rural health practitioners, and 3) place-sensitive approaches to rural agricultural policy formation. The research findings contribute novel understandings of the determinants of farmers' mental health and highlight the centrality of place in climate change-public (mental) health interventions.",

To know the role of water fowl as carrier of AIV-H5, the previous study was done to isolate AIV-H5 virus in ducks (Anas javanicus) traded at Sepanjang market, Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia. Of totally 156 in three-pooled duck cloacal-swab samples was collected. After isolated in Spesific Anibody Negative (SAN) embryonated chicken eggs Hemagglutination-Inhibition test (HI-test) was done to identify the AIV-H5. The results showed 43 (27.6%) of the samples were positive AIV-H5, and 33 (21.2 %) were unidentified. Further identification is needed to identify the untypeable samples.This means that ongoing spreading of AIV-H5and other subtype of AIVin those area were detected which might be lead toreassortment of AIV. Surveillance is needed as an early warning to detectthe emerging of a novel AIV. The recent discovery of MERS CoV as a zoonotic disease endemic in dromedary camels raised questions about the possible origin of this infection. Therefore, we set out to review the literature, history and statistics of camel farming, camel Human interface in Qatar, interviews and brainstorming with the stakeholders were conducted, in order to generate hypotheses about the drivers for MERS CoV emergence. The rapid increase in GDP in the past two decades has been paralleled with rapid growth of the production, camel trade and racing industry. As a precious animal, camels are being kissed, hugged, and greeted. Consistent with the disease seasonality, contact with animals intensies during winter time where camel-related activities ourish through race and beauty competitions, trade, camel reproduction and breeding. These activities imply extensive camel movement and mixing along with their owners and workers from all over the Gulf region. Moreover, camel products are used for a variety of domestic purposes. Camel workers live inside camel barns while owners pay regular visits to their barns. Nevertheless, they all strongly deny that MERS-CoV can be transmitted from camels to humans. More in-depth studies were needed to understand the role of social practices in the virus transmission. Hendra virus (HeV) causes fatal infection in horses and humans in eastern Australia. Pteropid bats (flying-foxes) are the natural reservoir. We undertook extensive fieldwork to elaborate key aspects of the infection and transmission dynamics in flying-foxes. Viral RNA was detected primarily in two of the four endemic species (Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus). Virus was most frequently detected in urine, less so in faeces, and minimally in saliva, nasal discharge, and blood. Spleen and kidney were the tissues most likely to yield virus. Geographically, HeV prevalence was highest in flying-foxes in southern Queensland/northern New South Wales. Viral RNA was detected in all months, with a marked winter peak in southern Queensland and central and northern NSW, paralleling the spatiotemporal clustering of equine cases. GPS dataloggers showed that flying-fox foraging was repetitious, with a preference for non-native plant species and a resultant increased activity around rural infrastructure. Further, horses used different areas of the paddock night and day, which could contribute to HeV exposure risk. Satellite telemetry illustrated the mobility of flying foxes and the connectivity of their roosts. Our detailed findings elaborate key aspects of HeV disease ecology, and allow risk mitigation strategies, including vaccination, to be more effectively targeted.",

Just as the LEED criteria provide an explicit method for rating sustainable building practices, we propose the development of a set of One Health criteria for dairy products that could be eventually used in food labeling to encourage consumers to support sustainable dairy food systems. Such criteria should include aspects such as life cycle analysis to calculate carbon footprint of different production systems and metrics to assess impacts on animal health and welfare, health of dairy workers and consumers and impact on local air, water, and soil environments.

Reducing the burden of foodborne infections therefore requires a concerted One Health collaborative effort involving experts from a wide range of disciplines including: medical, veterinary and environmental health; ecology, microbiology; molecular biology; epidemiology; social anthropology; and health economics -working alongside local and national government agencies and the food industry. Understanding the source of foodborne infections is essential for their control and prevention, and this requires identifying the relative contribution of animal reservoirs, transmission pathways and risk factors for infection. Recent advances have led to the development of new tools for 'source attribution', embracing recent developments in pathogen genome sequencing, and evolutionary modelling.

Methods included stakeholder analyses, policy framework analyses, systems analyses and key-informant interviews targeting the sectors of health, environment, agriculture and education. Important sectoral and cross-sectoral policy frameworks, responsibilities and health interventions that may mask the direct effects on disease transmission of climate change and variability and thereby hamper our full understanding of the specific effects of climate change on human health were identified and analysed. Systems, structures and guidelines are in place, however there are operational issues that may influence our understanding of climate change and human health interlinkages.",

Indigenous communities in northern Australia are situated within complex ecosystems and have a high risk of a rabies incursion. They contain large populations of free-roaming domestic dogs and are surrounded by wild dog populations. Therefore, the incursion of rabies into Australia, with spillover to wild dogs, is a genuine threat. The goal of this study is to determine strategies for controlling the spread of rabies in wild dog populations in northern Australia, should an incursion occur. The distribution and density of wild dogs across the study area as well as the extent of interactions between wild and domestic dogs -is being evaluated using a range of field approaches, including motion-activated cameras placed at strategic locations and genetic analysis of fecal samples collected in the bush. A model of rabies spread in wild dogs will be developed and tested using different control scenarios and input parameters. The decision support system developed in this project will help in planning for a potential rabies incursion impacting indigenous communities, wildlife populations and the ecosystem in northern Australia.",

Evidence for this includes climate change, biodiversity loss and the emergence of novel diseases. Efforts to mitigate against these changes include increasing conservation protected areas (PAs). An unintended consequence of this policy is that the costs to adjacent rural communities tend to be local and immediate whilst benefits generated are mostly externalized or inaccessible. Women are particularly vulnerable and are entangled into poverty cycles leading to further environmental degradation and decreased resilience. By examining the roles and responsibilities that local women have in managing resources at the human/animal/environment interface, we show how women and children are disproportionately affected by a wide range of health concerns, including infections (zoonotic and anthroponotic) and noncommunicable illnesses. The underlying drivers of disease are limited health care, restricted access to resources, malnutrition, air and water quality, human and animal conflict. We suggest that global conservation strategies need to be reassessed and that the acute problem of poverty with a gender perspective be made a priority around protected areas.",

Despite the tremendous progress in controlling the outbreak, the fact that Ebola emerged to affect West Africa in 2013 suggests Ebola virus may have become endemic in the region, potentially by circulation among animal populations. Without the identification of these possible animal ''reservoirs and hosts'' and development of prevention programs to block transmission from animals to humans, it is likely that future ''spillover'' of viruses will continue to occur because of continued animal-human contact. The concept of One Health is a collaborative effort to promote and improve the health of humans, animals and our environment through multidisciplinary activities. To avert another Ebola outbreak, a comprehensive, long-term, simultaneous, multi-country coordinated investigation into the potential host range is necessary, including sampling a wide taxonomic range of domestic and wild species. This project, currently underway in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone with assistance from USAID EPT2, may determine how widely distributed the virus may be among animal populations, and how animal host distribution will impact the response and prevention of Ebola in Sierra Leone and other West African countries.",

It is the center of excellence for animal disease surveillance, investigation, diagnosis and research which contributes substantial role in promoting export of animal and animal products, improvement of the livelihood of the smallholder farmers and pastoralists, provision of professional support for investors involved in animal farming and transfer technology for stakeholders. The implementation of the Quality Management System (QMS) in NAHDIC has brought an important milestone for the centre in the face of regional and international community's being as the Regional Referral Diagnostic Laboratory for avian flu and Newcastle diseases. This will have its own impact on international trade of animals and animal products from Ethiopia. Currently, NAHDIC has implemented ISO/IEC17025:2005 in three laboratories selecting 10 tests as its scope of accreditation from SANAS South Africa, since 2009. There are also 14 other regional veterinary laboratories in the country besides many districts, zonal and regional veterinary service clinics providing animal health services for millions of livestock in the country. Emergency response management for zoonotic disease outbreaks of many livestock diseases often involves several different priorities, including protecting animal and human health, food safety and food availability. Disease control measures including livestock and poultry quarantines and commodity movement restrictions may disrupt local and international market continuity and food security. Although NAHDIC has started working on surveillance of some zoonotic diseases such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), tuberculosis, brucellosis etc. as such it has not been working with concept of one health with other relevant human health and environmental protection Institutions. However thanks to Cambridge university of UK for ETCOBOT project on tuberculosis (bovine and human), DTRA/ ECEB for biosafety and biosecurity and CDC for Brucellosis (human and animal) projects the centre has started working in collaboration with stakeholders dealing human health and environmental protection activities. One health concept has already started in the country some years back by some Universities nevertheless it has not rooted yet in veterinary research and diagnostic laboratories. So the coordinated One Health approach by the human and animal health sectors in Ethiopia will improve the management of zoonoses of public health significance, and ensures the different interests of each sector. In response to the first report of transmissible colistin resistance mediated by the mcr-1 gene in E. coli, we focused on detection of plasmid mediated colistin resistance E. coli from wildlife. Fecal swabs of wintering migratory waterfowls in Pakistan were screened for phenotypic resistance to colistin using VITEK-2 system. RealTime PCR used to confirmed mcr-1 gene. Plasmid conjugation experiment was performed to show colistin gene is transferrable. For genetic characterization, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina, USA). In-silico analysis WGS data were performed on web service of the Center for Genomic Epidemiology. We found one colistin resistant ESBL-E. coli (MIC > 8 mg/L) from migratory Eurasian coot which carried mcr-1 gene on IncI2 plasmid. WGS data showed strain carried plasmid resistance genes for beta-lactam (blaTEM-1B, blaCTX-M-15), aminoglycosides (strB, strA, aadA1, aadA2), sulphonamide (sul3, sul2), tetracycline (tetB), trimethoprim (dfrA14). The strains belonged to MLST type ST354. Recently, mcr-1-harbouring E. coli of ST354 have also been identified in China from companion dogs and a human with a possible transmission link from dogs to human. The long-range migration of these birds can lead to intercontinental dissemination of mcr-1-carrying bacteria.",

At just 880 individuals, the mountain gorilla (G.b.beringei) in Rwanda, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo is the only great ape whose numbers in the wild are increasing. This is the result of ''extreme conservation'' measures centered on park protection, antipoaching patrols and veterinary care. Human habituation of wild mountain gorillas facilitates ecotourism that provides essential revenue to the governments, but brings more than 29,000 people into close contact with mountain gorillas annually. This poses a potential risk for zoonotic pathogen transmission to this endangered species; human pathogens have been confirmed to cause mortality in wild great apes. Habituation also creates an opportunity for One Health interventions: with government partners, Gorilla Doctors provides clinical care to ill and injured gorillas, closely monitors the populations for disease events, cares for confiscated primates, and delivers a preventive health program to park workers. As the implementing partner for the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT project, Gorilla Doctors conducts zoonotic pathogen surveillance and research to better understand diseases in eastern gorillas and inform mitigation strategies for reducing the risk of pathogen transmission between people and gorillas.

Relative abundance and AMR properties are measured phenotypically by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion, isolated with differential and selective agars, and by molecular characterization. Specific results from the enumeration and characterization of AMR strains shared across sample medias and collaborating global sites suggests possible sources and persistence in the environment and community. For example, our preliminary analysis of ESBL showed a 24.06% positive detection of total coliform in waste water influent compared to 0.03% positive detection in post treatment waste water effluent.

Fasciola gigantica and Schistosoma bovis are water transmitted trematodes affecting livestock, similar to Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni that cause human disease. By applying One Health research, we investigated these human and animal infections in parallel aiming at elucidating a predictive potential of one to the other and providing the evidence base for One Health intervention strategy development. At Lake Chad, mobile pastoralists of four different ethnic groups participated. In humans (N = 401), Schistosoma haematobium showed a prevalence of 8%. Schistosoma mansoni prevalence was 0.4%. In cattle (N = 534), prevalence of Fasciola gigantica was 31% and Schistosoma bovis 20%. Equally in humans and cattle, prevalence correlated within ethnic groups, but varied significantly between ethnic groups. Our results reveal that the mutual predictive value of human schistosomiasis and livestock fascioliasis is defined by transhumance patterns and husbandry system. With a systems understanding of health this shows that taking the ecological and ethnical dimension into consideration is crucial to develop tailor-made locally adapted and accepted interventions, applying the One Health approach. We identify the factors that influence the adoption of effective interventions to control avian influenza (AI) outbreaks among poultry farmers. This involves the use of the Health Belief Model and the Snyder Hope Scale, exploring determinants of AI preventive measures among 108 backyard poultry farmers in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Almost all farmers (> 94%) acknowledged the severity of AI in poultry, and the contagiousness of AI infection. Farmers were aware of interventions to minimise the risk of infection for their flock and themselves, but monetary constraints were reported to impede them from implementing the full range of AI preventive measures. About 72% of the farmers indicated that the investment cost building separate poultry houses remains a major barrier to AI prevention. We used the Hope Scale, a cognitive model describing the farmer's capacity to initiate actions and to generate routes to reach the goal of controlling AI spread. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) relationships indicated more hopeful groups: 1) farmers who are aware of AI and 2) members of certain religious groups. They may therefore be more likely to explore multiple options for AI prevention. This study suggests that social, structural and individual behavioural determinants should be considered in developing future AI control programs.",

Attention to rural water public health management policies in Vietnam has been limited in scope. This BBN and other policy tools can assist in understanding the role policy can play in helping SSI farmers understand options for engaging in water public health mitigation strategies that do not disrupt their chosen livelihoods. Zoonotic diseases transmitted by arthropods and rodents can be a serious public health issue in China. We sought experts' opinions on China's capacity to meet the environmental and social challenges of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases in a changing climate. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 30 infectious diseases experts in four cities in China. Two vector-borne diseases (dengue fever and malaria) and a rodent-borne disease (haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) were discussed. A thematic analysis identified strengths and shortcomings of the current system. Participants expressed optimism in China's future capacity to manage these diseases. However, health literacy in the population is lacking, research capacity could be strengthened, and improved training and conditions for staff involved in surveillance and response would aid capacity building. Early warnings of disease outbreaks would be useful, and prompt and coordinated responses are required when outbreaks occur. It was also considered important that health professionals remain skilled in the identification of diseases such as malaria for which incidence is declining in China, so that re-emerging or emerging disease trends can be rapidly identified and interventions activated. The study's recommendations may be useful to policymakers in China and the Asia Pacific region.",

With the likelihood that serious epidemics of emerging zoonotic diseases could arise in coming years, a One Health approach is increasingly being considered the most appropriate way to manage these threats. Australian communicable disease notification systems have to date focused primarily on human diseases. This presentation will discuss the benefits and barriers to integrated veterinary and public health surveillance linking animal and human data. Whilst this has been successful in managing zoonoses to some extent at state S62 Abstracts level, a national system is yet to be realised. Issues such as information sharing, security issues, the challenges of data linkage; and the potential need for a national coordination authority will be discussed. Biosecurity risks are increasing as a consequence of agricultural intensification, global trade, climate change and other factors, and the need for surveillance for livestock diseases and zoonoses is growing. Within domains of expertise, much is known about surveillance methodologies, information and communication technologies, and sociocultural factors that influence disease reporting. However, few examples exist where cross-disciplinary collaboration has progressed beyond a pilot stage and delivered transformative change in surveillance capacity at a national level. This presentation explores the reasons why investments in surveillance systems that do not address technical, technological and social dimensions are unlikely to be effective or sustainable. Reasons include the tendency to focus on the technical and technological domains and ignore the central role that people play in surveillance systems, as contributors and users of surveillance information. Conversely, the implementation of strategies that motivate and enable people at every level of the surveillance system -from the farmer to the central policy-maker -can substantially enhance surveillance capability and health service delivery. We discuss recent experience in Indonesia which demonstrates how a multidisciplinary team put these theories into practice to establish a national animal health information system that currently receives more than 7,000 reports per day.",

Community gardens offer physical and mental health benefits to alleviate some of these stressors for immigrants. In this project, refugee settlement agencies partnered with urban and suburban churches to convert their lawns to gardens and create new community garden space to immigrants in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, USA. This study reports on the evaluation of this project using pre and post surveys and focus groups with gardeners. The surveys had a 44% response rate. There was a statistically significant increase in vegetable intake throughout the day between the pre and post surveys. Only 3% of gardeners indicated food insecurity issues but 84% participated in one or more food subsidy program. Qualitatively, gardeners indicated the value of the gardens to improve their mental and physical health, and the social connections. The results illustrate the value of gardening for improved physical and mental health of refugees and strengthened social connections. In addition, the model of converting lawns into gardens has implications for creating a more sustainable use of the environment. In 2014 German Watch declared Bangladesh as the 5th ranked country in climate risk. Every year it is attacked by cyclone creates huge impact on mental well being but this issue is still a neglected topic. We conducted this exploratory study with a view to explore the situation of mental health services in a cyclone affected village. A social mapping, KII with different stakeholders (10) & IDI with affected people (10) were done for identification of location of health care service centers, activities of government institution, NGOs, local volunteers, informal health care providers, resources & possible future steps related to mental health care. It was revealed that natural disasters like cyclone had many psychological impacts on population. People have suffered by post traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, panic, acute stress reaction, sad feelings, suicidal thoughts & children and female were more vulnerable. The government/NGOs had no specific plan of action/ initiative to address these issues. There was a visible gap in thinking about finding of an effective way to give the people proper psycho social services. To make resilient & responsive health systems for this vulnerable group of population, implementation of effective mental health program with a strong mental health policy is needed.",

Formative research from several countries suggests that poultry may be a particular risk, because poultry stay close to the household and defecate in areas where children habitate. Two studies found that children often directly ingest chicken feces, and a third found that 28% of mothers reported that their children had eaten soil in the past 2 weeks. A three-country nutrition study reported that animal feces were visible in 38-42% of household compounds, and that this indicator was negatively associated with height-for-age Z scores in models that adjusted for confounding factors. Surveys from Ethiopia and Bangladesh recorded whether or not poultry were kept in the main household dwelling overnight. Both found negative associations between these indicators and child growth, and the Bangladesh study also found a positive association with markers for environmental enteric disorder. Recent data from 40 countries shows that poultry are the most commonly owned livestock in poor countries. Poultry ownership is therefore likely to be an important risk for child health outcomes, though more research is needed on these issues.",

HDR has used this approach on projects globally including Kenya and Iraq. The modules were designed with consistent dimensions to easily fit together, akin to LEGO blocks. The modules incorporate current international best practices and are designed to ensure the potential for a sustainable approach utilizing local trades, methods and materials. Three dimensional drawings and plans, annotated with equipment requirements, are used for each module. The intent is that the modules can be used in early stage design meetings to allow users to make well informed selections of spaces to quickly realize a schematic design with sufficient information to develop accurate space, service and budget requirements. The primary advantage of this unique approach is to shorten the time and reduce overhead costs related to the design phase. The goal has been to develop a system that allows flexibility to address unique risks in unique situations, while taking advantage of the quality and consistency inherent in a well-developed, repeatable, and sustainable design. The zoonotic tapeworm Taenia solium is highly endemic in Zambia, however the societal cost of the parasite is unknown. Baseline economic costs related to T. solium cysticercosis in people and pigs were measured in fifty percent of randomly selected households in the study villages. One questionnaire (n = 245) captured individual costs related to clinical signs commonly attributable to human T. solium infections. A pig questionnaire (n = 271) captured herd demographic data, costs of pig-keeping, and economic losses from porcine cysticercosis. Human health data revealed 30 (12.2%) cases of seizure-like episodes, 90 (36.7%) of severe chronic headaches, and 54 (22.0%) of blurry vision or blindness, leading to 137 health care consultations and 16 hospitalisations in a five-year period. Hospitalisation costs ranged from $0-$570USD per visit. 489 working days were lost due to the surveyed conditions per year. Median monthly household income is $0USD (mean $9.20USD, range $0-$250USD). Twenty-five percent of surveyed households keep pigs, mostly free-ranging. Median pig-keeping costs are $0.50USD per pig per month. Over 95% of adult pigs are sold to local traders, who commonly perform tongue palpation before purchase. 94.5% (256/271) of survey respondents cannot sell tongue-positive pigs; infected pigs that are sold lose 45% of their value.",

This work aims to understand how differences in Africa's potential future pathways of development may affect infectious disease emergence through intensification of livestock production. Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models of emerging infectious disease (EID) events were developed based on past events, socioeconomic and environmental variables that span human, livestock, and wildlife populations. To represent demand for protein, Shared-Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) projections were produced for volume of meat and eggs using projections of human population and GDP to 2050. ZIP results highlight the importance of pig density, wild mammal diversity, and forest cover change to explain zoonotic disease emergence. Sheep and goats are also important livestock groups. Emergence hotspot countries were identified, such as Cameroon and Uganda. The largest increases in projected meat and eggs occurred in SSP5 (high challenges to mitigation and adaptation to climate change) followed by SSP1 (low challenges to mitigation and adaptation). An SSP case study analysis showed areas in Chad, Ghana, and Kenya with high probability for EIDs relating to projected increased pig and human population density.

They take hold in landscapes that are segmented by land tenure boundaries, fragmented governance regimes and short-term planning cycles. Current management and control approaches are informed by technical expertise in species ecology, however successful implementation also requires sustained and coordinated collective community action. This paper emerges from a multi-disciplinary research program that integrates behavioural science, institutional analysis and community engagement scholarship to build more effective and equitable strategies for invasive species governance. The program seeks to augment technical and scientific knowledge with social science that explores the human dimensions of invasive species management. Specific pest vertebrate species such as feral pigs and wild dogs are highly mobile in the landscape, creating disputes over where responsibility for control should lie. Using narrative interview and analysis techniques, case studies uncover stories of success, complexity and trade offs, particularly in relation to biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Analysis shows that land managers hold diverse and nuanced perspectives about invasive animal control, the role of collective action and the barriers and opportunities for improvement in management practices. This paper presents empirical data and makes suggestions for application of these findings in front-line community engagement practice.

Chronic exposure to elevated levels of fluoride have been demonstrated to cause significant pathology and disease in affected human populations. We investigated bone and dental pathology and clinical signs of lameness in a range of marsupial species resident near two fluoride-emitting industrial facilities in southern Victoria and found these to be consistent with chronic fluoride toxicity indicating elevated levels of fluoride in the environment immediately adjacent to the facilities.

Despite advances our global food system still fails to feed a significant part of humanity adequately. While transformations in global agrifood value chains have made a greater variety of food commodities available to consumers in many countries around the globe, they have also led to greater homogeneity in the global food system, compromising dietary diversity and environmental sustainability. The enhanced use of biodiversity is a cornerstone of an integrated approach to address the 'triple burden of malnutrition'. Countries such as Brazil have shown by strategic actions and interventions that it is possible to create better environments to mainstream biodiversity for healthier diets and improved nutrition into government programs and public policies. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents an opportunity to reshape food systems and move beyond business-as-usual towards sustainability and the provision of healthy diets, however, at present the importance of biodiversity for healthy agriculture, food systems and diets is not adequately reflected in the SDGs. Since discovery of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) in 1996 and human deaths now totalling three, Australia has aggressively managed potential lyssavirus exposures. This has led to significantly greater use of Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) in post exposure treatment as defined by current guidelines, and usage has not been curtailed despite a welldocumented chronic global shortage of HRIG and scarcity of the product in countries with endemic canine rabies and high rates of human deaths. Disproportionate HRIG use by risk-averse wealthy countries with low rates of human lyssavirus infection is an issue of global distributive justice. There has been no appetite in Australia to re-assess the tolerance of risk to potential lyssavirus exposures. With Australia's worsening obesity epidemic and increased travel to rabies-endemic areas, the volume of HRIG use will only increase. This presentation argues that current guidelines for management of potential lyssavirus exposures both in Australia and other industrialised nations raise ethical dilemmas that must be addressed. This presentation argues for a unified approach to rigorous risk stratification of potential exposures, according to factors such as mode of exposure (bite vs. scratch), species of animal (non-human primates and rodents), geographic location of exposure and site of injury.",

In support, an Administrative Order established the Philippine Interagency Committee on Zoonosis, enabling cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration in various levels of government and society. The National Rabies Program has divided the Philippines into 18 regions with 81 provinces in order to pursue stepwise rabies elimination.

A total of 103 AGM and 1500 pools of mosquitoes were screened for arboviruses by virus isolation in cell culture, RT-PCR, nested PCR-high resolution melting analysis and sequencing. Molecular exploration data demonstrate that Chikungunya, Sindbis, Usutu, Bunyamwera and Semliki forest viruses circulate in free-ranging NHPs and zoophillic mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti, Culex pippiens and Culex zombaensis) within Kisumu and Mombasa urban centre in Kenya, East Africa. Retrospectively, the surveillance data from this study yields useful information on possible source of arbovirus infection in humans residing in populated African urban areas.",

This study concerns the burden and spatial nature of enteric fever, attributable to Salmonella Typhi in Central Division, Republic of Fiji at a sub-catchment scale over 30-months (2013-2015) . Quantitative spatial analysis revealed relationships between environmental conditions of sub-catchments and incidence and recurrence of typhoid. Average incidence per sub-catchment for Central Division was high at 205.9/100 000, with cases recurring in each calendar year in 26% of sub-catchments. Numbers of cases were highest within dense, urban coastal sub-catchments, but incidence was highest in low-density mountainous rural areas. Significant environmental determinants at this scale suggest increased risk of exposure where sediment yields increase following runoff. Small populations living near small, erosional, high-energy headwaters and small streams unconnected to large hydrological networks, appear at reduced risk compared to large systems that broaden into meandering mid-reaches and floodplains with alluvial deposition. This study indicates that anthropogenic alteration of land cover and hydrology (particularly via fragmentation of riparian forest and connectivity between road and river networks) affects the transmission of typhoid and that environmental (long-cycle) transmission of typhoid is important in Fiji.",

To establish a risk-based surveillance strategy to detect emerging diseases that threaten human health for the Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT project, we examined past trends in animal hosts and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic viruses and amplification by human-to-human spread. We find that viruses with high host plasticity (i.e. taxonomically diverse host range) were more likely to amplify viral spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and have broader geographic spread. Viruses transmitted to humans during circumstances that facilitated mixing of diverse animal species had significantly higher host plasticity. We also identified a strong linear relationship between species abundance and viral spillover, with the more common species, especially those increasing in abundance, having transmitted more viruses to humans. Our findings suggest that surveillance should be focused at high-risk interfaces that facilitate mixing of animal species in areas with high biodiversity, dense human populations, and land use change that facilitates frequent contact between people and wildlife, particularly highly adaptable species increasing in abundance.",

These two goals reveal vexing tensions and represent a compelling challenge for effective and public-health informed governance of extractive industries. Juxtaposing the imperatives of environmental preservation and sustainable development, which includes protecting associated social, cultural and health resources, offers an opportunity to explore how these spaces are being created in historically underserved and underserviced regions. Tools such as environmental, social and health impact assessments, impact and benefit and agreements and regulatory processes that require free, prior and informed consent, with their many opportunities and challenges, begin to offer more systematic, and hopefully just, approaches to the charting of these spaces, while raising many questions, including about the role of equity, participation, adequacy of information, consent and conflict. These questions will be examined and examples will be drawn from work conducted in health impact assessment practices from the Southern Gobi region of Mongolia, and with the impact benefit agreement processes in Northern Canada and Alaska, USA, to explore whether and how sustainable consumption and protection of ecosystems might coexist. Health is closely related to the quality of the environment in which people live. Geohelminthiasis infections are among the most common infections in the world, affecting the poorest communities. The WHO recommends periodic deworming for children (1-15 years) living in areas where the prevalence of infections is estimated at more than 20%. In Democratic Republic of Congo, especially in the underserved region of North Kivu, many children working in artisanal mining may not receive necessary treatment. The goal of this study was to identify the parasite carriage in this group. We collected and analyzed 125 fecal samples from children aged 6-15 who work in artisanal mining. We found that 65.6% of children have Ancylostoma duodenale, 94.4% have Trichuris trichiura, and 96.8% have Ascaris lumbricoides, and many of them have never been dewormed. Our research demonstrates the immediate need for a deworming program and health education for disease prevention in the North Kivu mining region. The ultimate goal of our work is to eliminate child mining, given the risk of exposure to multiple diseases, injury, and radiation exposure common in artisanal mining, though the challenge is great given the prevalence of poverty and war in region Stemming from the concept that ''One Health creates a framework for educating the next generation of health professionals'', the College of Osteopathic Medicine (COMP) and the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at Western University of Health Sciences (WUHS), California, have initiated a One Health Rotation for fourth year students. The goal of this rotation is to present the students with opportunities and skills that prepare them for the changing landscape of health care and public health to better serve their communities in the future. The setting spans urban and rural environments, where animals provide food and income and are an integral component of household survival strategies. The rotation takes place in Meru University of Science and Technology, Kenya, and includes a one week didactic seminars with an emphasis on zoonotic diseases, environmental health and One Health concepts, followed by an intensive hands-on 3 week experience focusing on zoonotic pathogens and methods to assess and control human, animal and environmental contaminants. The students assess human-animal-environment interactions, develop group research projects and present the results to community leaders to address local challenges. Because of its potential to enhance inter-professional education, this rotation will be expanded to include other health professions at WUHS.",

Results from a study carried out on such a global scale is likely to produce insights that streamline the approach to ZEID risks. Emerging results show interesting patterns: for example, while there are some overlapping priorities, Indonesia has more concerns about outbreak prone diseases, while those in South Africa are centered around endemic zoonoses.

Olival PhD 1 and Maureen Miller PhD 1 1 EcoHealth Alliance 2 IPB Bogor High levels of undiagnosed disease occur in Sulawesi, Indonesia, along with potential behaviors (wildlife consumption) that may be high risk for zoonotic disease spillover. Little is known about the disease experiences and wildlife exposures among people involved in the wildlife trade. We conducted 47 targeted ethnographic interviews with people involved in the wildlife trade in Northern Sulawesi between February and July 2016. Participants included 26 women and 21 men, between 30 to 65 years old, and included hunters, collectors, transporters, vendors and consumers of wildlife. Half of the participants raised domestic animals and had free access to wildlife meat. No one reported using any protective gear when working with wildlife, (e.g., hunters used leaves and plants to carry captured wildlife). Hunters and vendors considered that they had no alternative livelihood options. The majority of participants were unaware of disease risks posed by wildlife, although 80% had experienced high fevers and other unusual illnesses. Local doctors attributed the illness to viruses of unknown origin. Herbs and traditional practices are used to cure such fevers. The lack of knowledge of disease risks posed by wildlife may facilitate zoonotic disease spillover. Periodic outbreaks of rabies occur in animals and humans in Zambia. Rabies control programme in Zambia relies on the vaccination of dog populations using domestically produced rabies vaccine which is used mainly in rural areas. However, the efficacy and the field effectiveness of the local vaccine are not elucidated. To estimate the vaccine coverage against rabies in dog populations, we conducted epidemiological surveys in urban (n = 200) and rural areas (n = 859) in Zambia. The efficacy and effectiveness of the domestic vaccine were evaluated and compared to those of the imported commercial rabies vaccine (Rabisin \u00d2 , Merial, France). The vaccine coverage in domestic dogs in urban area was 24.5% (95% confidence interval: 18.5-30.5). The vaccine coverage in domestic dogs in rural area was attained at 42.4% (95% confidence interval: 39.1-45.7) following the mass vaccination campaign. The proportion of the dogs which were successfully immunized with Rabisin \u00d2 single shot was 76.9% (95% confidence interval: 46.2-95.0), on the contrary, that with the local vaccine single shot was 12.5% (95% confidence interval: 1.55-38.3). For the effective rabies control, studies to better understand the appropriate vaccination strategies are ongoing.",

A cross-sectional study of the Nairobi pork system collected data through focus group discussions and individual interviews with farmers, traders, abattoir owners, large companies' managers, retailers, government officers and consumers. Data were analysed to identify, describe and quantify the main pork chains, their food safety risk practices and explore their link with chain governance, distribution of benefits and barriers to improving the system. Main food safety risk practices for 'city pig keepers' were: handling and consumption of sick pigs. Pigs in slums were channelled directly to consumers and butchers or through less integrated markets (LIA). In 'LIA', risk practices were: lack of traceability and cold chain. These, with chains of pork from on-farm slaughtering, governed the lower end market. Among retailers, there was a lack of hygiene due to poor infrastructure and scarcity of water. The understanding obtained on chain governance, barriers and system inequalities associated to these risks provide a foundation to design control strategies.",

Detailed ecological knowledge is required to assess and predict disease risk by identify ''unhealthy'' ecosystems (habitat patches) where the density of infected animals is highest. Both the density of host species and proportion of infected animals are important in determining risk, but may be influenced by different and opposing factors. For example, intermediate levels of fragmentation may result in the local extinction of competitors and predators but enable persistence of high density populations of host species in suitable habitat patches; whereas extreme levels of fragmentations may result in local extinction of the host. We here discuss how habitat type and disturbance, host predators, and competitors interact to determine disease risk and we rank these factors by their importance.

Methodology included transect walk across areas occupied by Kuchi during winter, group discussions and semi-structured interviews in Naran an Zhob. Our study shows that toward the North some 350 Kuchi families have shifted their mobility during summer from the central Afghan highlands to the Himalayan uplands of Naran in Northern Pakistan. Toward the south near Zhob, many Kuchi's still cross into Pakistan with their livestock herds.

There has also been extensive investment in enhanced active and passive surveillance systems as well as epidemiological capacity in both the human and animal health sectors over the same period. However, internal and external assessments and evaluations within both sectors indicate the persistence of specific gaps in the implementation of Joint Circular 16 on coordinated prevention and control of zoonotic diseases, information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration.

We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for papers published between 2011 and 2016, using the terms 'EcoHealth', 'OneHealth', 'ecosystems', and 'zoonotic'. We drew out epistemological and methodological themes and identified overlaps and difference between the two approaches and considered the extent to which SD modelling brings together the strengths of both. SD enables understanding of non-linear relationships in complex systems, emphasising feedback loops and changing relationships over time. Multiple perspectives can be brought together in causal loop diagrams, which canbe translated into a SD simulation model to test policy options. When combined with a robust collaborative learning process, PSD couldsupport policy formulation for zoonosis reduction, building on robust data in a One Health framework while incorporating the participatory, holistic principles of Ecohealth.",

In each city, following a multi-stakeholder' engagement process, two cross-sectional surveys were done in dry and rainy seasons, namely, household questionnaire, blood, feces and urine analysis, entomological, malacological and geographical surveys. Additionally, weather and climate data were generated and analysed. In Korhogo (C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire), intestinal schistosomiasis is predominant (4.6%) while urinary forms predominate in Kaedi (4%) and are statistically higher in the dry season (v2 = 5.64; p = 0.017).

We evaluated how extensive desertion of rice paddies in Taiwan after joining World Trade Organization, and how periodic plow, an agricultural policy targeting for farm pests, can unexpectedly influence ticks and larval trombiculid mites (chiggers). Flooded rice fields were assumed to sustain very few ticks and chiggers. Striped field mice, main hosts for both vectors, harbored 6 times more ticks, and 3 times more chiggers in abandoned (fallow) than in plowed plots. The proportion of ticks infected with Rickettsia spp. (etiologic agent of spotted fever) was 3x higher in fallow plots, while that of Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus) in chiggers was similar in both treatments. Moreover, ticks and chiggers were dominated by species known to infest humans. We conclude that ticks and chiggers proliferate after rice paddies are abandoned, but periodic plowing may mitigate vector burdens. An unexpected consequence of globalization may be elevated disease risk in the face of economically-induced changes in agricultural practices, although this may be unintentionally mitigated by agricultural policies, calling for further research on vector-borne diseases and their control from broader perspectives.",

To examine the influence of past illnesses, the non-linear and time varying association of cryptosporidiosis with an index of global climate variability, the Dipole Mode Index (DMI), was assessed using models modified to include past cryptosporidiosis counts. As exposure-disease relationships vary geographically, we focused on weekly reports of cryptosporidiosis from 2001 to 2012 in Australia from the tropical, subtropical and temperate regions (92% of all reported cryptosporidiosis). In the subtropical region, disease risk was strongly positively associated with an immediate increase in DMI, although this general relationship was observed across all climate zones. These findings provide some support for the previously established role of rainfall with cryptosporidiosis as the expected increases in the frequency of positive DMI events may result in regional decreases in rainfall, increasing turbidity and pathogen concentration in water sources, leading to more waterborne cryptosporidiosis. Future models for environmentally sensitive infectious diseases that account for previous illness may better represent the time dependant environmental exposure-disease relationship. Evaluation capacity building has gained traction in many organizations as they face increasing demands for accountability and sustainable evaluation practice. Its goal is to strengthen an organization's knowledge and skills in designing, implementing, and managing effective evaluation projects, and using evaluation findings for decision-making and action. While evaluation capacity building activities and processes vary in organizations, the strategies being used and the overall effectiveness are not well explored. Going further, building capacity in evaluation of integrative approach projects (e.g. Ecohealth projects) come with its own set of challenges. Evaluation capacity building of a new Ecohealth research center has been supported by volunteers from the Volunteers for Healthy Animals and Healthy communities program (Vets without Borders Canada). We present a framework, and discuss teaching and learning strategies used to facilitate capacity building (e.g. a combination of workshops and mentoring). Lessons learned and challenges will be shared, for example essential evaluation core capacities, and operational challenges of Ecohealth research projects. The authors conclude with their own learnings and reflections of building evaluation capacity.",

There are approximately 112 million working equids in the developing world; in some countries populations are increasing. A strong case exists for the impact of working equids on the social, economic, and cultural determinants of health. Working equids are essential for goods transport and contribute to economies and food security locally and globally. Working equids may enable access to health services or social support networks. Working equid owners are often lower in the social gradient, under social and economic stress, and may be socially excluded. If a working equid is unable to perform, a child or woman may replace that labor, which can adversely affect childhood development. This may also translate into unemployment, lost income and time. Using evidence from a cross sectional survey of working equid owners in rural Nicaragua and the existing literature, the interdependence of livelihoods and health on working equids is illustrated. Understanding how livelihoods and health depend on a working equid's contributions to a household has broad reaching policy and development implications. Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease in the Pacific Islands. Disease transmission is strongly driven by humansanimal-environment interactions, which in turn are mediated by broader socio-demographic, cultural and environmental factors. In Fiji, two successive cyclones and severe flooding in 2012 resulted in outbreaks associated with 7% case-fatality. A field study was conducted in 2013 using an eco-epidemiological approach to integrate survey data with geospatial environmental and census data, and quantify the relative importance of risk factors at different ecological scales. Leptospira antibodies were found in 19.4% of 2152 participants from 81 communities on the 3 main islands. On multivariable logistic regression modelling, significant individual-level risk factors included male, ethnicity, poor access to water, and working outdoors. Significant environmental predictors of infection included living in rural areas (OR 1.43), poverty rate (OR 1.74 in communities with 40% poverty), living 100 m from a major river (OR 1.41), pigs in the community (OR 1.54), high cattle density in district (OR 1.04 per head/sqkm), and rainfall in wettest month (OR 1.003 per mm).

Panellists rated conceptions of OH and priorities for EZD preparedness planning using a series of scenarios developed through the study. Interview data were analysed qualitatively using thematic analysis techniques. Panellists agreed that OH is a cross-disciplinary collaborative effort between the veterinary, medical, and ecological sciences and the relevant government agencies encompassing animal, human, and environmental health policy and research. Human health was the most important priority in EZD planning. However, qualitative analysis suggested that consideration of non-human animal health and welfare as well was very important, and that effective pandemic planning demands regional leadership and international cooperation. Findings suggest that affluent urban states, such as Singapore, need to take on greater regional responsibilities and leadership roles in managing EZDs, especially those with potential global health impacts. Findings also suggest that culling is not an ethically viable response to EZDs.

Collectively, Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens vector a range of arboviruses, and their distributions influence human disease risk. Field surveys showed a greater proportional decrease of Cx. pipiens in trash versus managed containers from early to late summer, when the densities of Ae. albopictus, and associated competition, increased. An accompanying laboratory experiment showed greater decreases in Cx. pipiens survival and development with increasing Ae. albopictus density in trash versus managed container treatments.

Changes in endemic areas such as economic advancement, improvements in sanitation and education could be expected to reduce the prevalence of these diseases, however in many endemic areas these seem unlikely except in the distant future. Characteristics of the transmission cycles for cysticercosis and echinococcosis limit the opportunities that are available for combining interventions for these diseases together with other infections, including other NTDs. Vaccination of livestock animals to prevent transmission of T. solium and E. granulosus through their natural animal intermediate hosts is now a viable option for controlling both cysticercosis and cystic echinococcosis. Field trials of the TSOL18 and EG95 vaccines have demonstrated their effectiveness against field-derived infections in pigs and sheep, respectively. Critical to the further validation of these as control measures will be demonstration of the practicality and sustainability of their use in poor resource settings.",

The increase in the number of Brucellosis outbreaks in animals from 1990 to 2013 and the numbers of human patients diagnosed with brucellosis in private clinics and hospitals has placed Brucellosis to be among the top re-emerging diseases in the country. Brucellosis infection in humans is non-specific and caused by direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their products. Brucellosis manifests as intermittent fever, headache, weakness, profuse sweating, chills, weight loss, generalized aching that may involve multiple organ systems in the body. In animals, Brucella organisms localize in the reproductive organs, causing abortions, decreased milk yields and temporary sterility. Its effects impact negatively to the sale value of the affected animals causing financial losses to the animal owners. Brucellosis was investigated in three districts of south Western Uganda by the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) in May and June, 2015 under the sponsorship of the United States Department of State Biosecurity Engagement Programme (BEP). Brucellosis test results from a total of 1503 cattle showed a sero-prevalence of 14% in Kiruhura, 18% Bushenyi and 23% Mbarara districts respectively. ELISApositive Brucella cases from farm attendants on the sampled farms in the same districts had a prevalence of 4% in Kiruhura, 9% in Bushenyi and 12% in Mbarara. This underscores Brucella exposure as one of the major re-emerging diseases that should be treated with great concern by both Ministry of Health and MAAIF. Based on our results, we believe that the Ministry of Health and Agriculture should increase on community sensitization on the risk of Brucella.infections in humans from cattle, and promote measures that can protect high risk families from getting infected. This survey indicates that Brucellosis infections are still prevalent in Uganda and continue to occur in the local communities. The public health and animal health service providers need to work together in compiling the disease epidemiological data for a concerted disease intervention measures.",

This makes it one of the most highly venerable countries for highly infectious disease outbreaks in Africa. There have been outbreaks of major zoonotic diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever, Yellow Fever, Influenza, etc. While these are highly infectious diseases and may cause big outbreaks, they have been quickly detected and controlled in Uganda. Uganda has been able to detect and control these diseases without causing major outbreaks because of establishing capacity for surveillance and diagnostics, having a sample referral system, and continuous educaction and sensitization with support from CDC, GHSA and DTRA. Even some new infections like Sosuga virus, Sunguru virus, Bukakata virus, etc., have been identified through these systems. Vector and arbovirus surveillance is conducted annually as part of an integrated arbovirus surveillance and control program. MVEV was last detected in Victoria in 2011, following a La Ni\u00f1a climatic event which led to extensive flooding throughout the state. Although there were no confirmed human cases in 2011, MVEV and KUNV (as well as Ross River virus) contributed to one of the largest equine arbovirus outbreaks in Australia. The magnitude of vector abundance and the co-circulation of arboviruses highlighted limitations with the methodologies currently employed within the surveillance program. Recently, advanced molecular methods, such as massive parallel sequencing, have the potential to improve the identification of mosquito species and virus isolates detected by surveillance programs. Such innovations will contribute to smarter surveillance programs, which are responsive to emerging endemic and exotic vector-borne risks.",

Currently little is known about the epidemiology of these infections, however significant differences exist to hospital acquired MRSA infections for which risk factors have been well established. Dogs have been documented as asymptomatic carriers of MRSA in a number of studies despite this bacteria not being considered part of their normal flora. Dogs play an important role in Aboriginal communities with close inter-species contact. In addition dogs in remote communities are frequently overpopulated and have poor skin health. These factors make it likely that rates of MRSA carriage will be higher in dogs in Aboriginal communities than in other populations. A cross-sectional study is proposed for September 2016 to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic MRSA carriage by dogs in 5 remote Aboriginal communities in NSW. Two hundred dogs will be recruited from a community dog health program. Swabs will be taken from the nares, buccal mucosa, perineum and skin lesions or wounds (if present) for bacterial culture.

            "text": "University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa A series of ecological, economic and demographic changes are impacting on the distribution and endemicity of zoonotic diseases in resource-poor settings. The first is changes in climate, including in ambient temperature and precipitation, with impact on animal habitat, distribution and density. This has resulted in changes to host-feeding choices, human-vector contact rates and parasite transmission. These changes combine with changed vector habitat and behaviour in response to the use of insecticides, and changes in the density and residence patterns of humans and domesticated animals. In elaborating this, I consider three zoonotic diseases of poverty. In the case of Chagas disease, in South America, I illustrate how triatomin bugs vary their feeding patterns and so the transmission of T. cruzi depending on the location of domesticated animals. While improved human living conditions will reduce the potential for the bugs to infest human dwellings, this will also reduce the probability of human/animal co-residence, so reducing alternative blood meals for the bugs. I then consider African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), which is recurring as human populations lose prior immunity, with a risk too of concentration in domesticated animal hosts as wild host populations decline. My third example, zoonotic schistosomiasis, highlights the complexities of ecosystems where humans and animals coexist, both in Asia and in Africa. In these examples, there is clear evidence of links between shifts in the density and regional settlement of human and animal populations, maximising opportunities for the vector and parasite. Although the direct relationship between biodiversity and disease transmission is uncertain, human settlement and behaviour clearly influence parallel changes in biodiversity and the epidemiology of zoonotic disease. Suspected zoonoses are reported through the medical authorities among pastoral communities in Tanzania. There is limited knowledge on how pastoral communities understand zoonoses in relation to their livelihoods, culture and their wider ecology. This study was carried out to assess knowledge and perceptions on zoonoses among pastoralists in Ngorongoro, Kibaha and Bagamoyo Districts. Qualitative interviews and participatory epidemiology were used. The understanding amongst pastoralists of zoonotic disease in these areas is still evolving, as there is no specific term in the local language that describes it. Pastoralists from Ngorongoro possessed a higher understanding on the existence of a number of zoonoses than others. Understanding of zoonoses could be categorized into two broad groups: a local syndromic framework, specific symptoms of a particular ailment in humans concurred with symptoms in animals, and the biomedical framework. While the knowledge about zoonoses is increasing, social and cultural practices maintaining social cohesion and certain passage rites will still put pastoralists at risk of zoonoses. Well-managed, equipped meat inspection practices could be used to advocate about zoonoses. These findings show how health trends are perceived, and how epidemiology and biomedicine are shaping pastoralists health perspectives while transforming people's conceptualization of life and health. This study determined the spatial distribution of Schistosoma haematobium and related risk factors in Ndumo area, uMkhanyakude District, KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa. A sample of 435 schoolchildren between 10 to 15 years old from 10 primary schools was screened for S. haematobium using the filtration method. The GPS for their homesteads were recorded. Getis-Ord Gi* and Bernoulli model were used to determine the hotspots of S. haematobium. Semiparametric-Geographically Weighted Regression (s-GWR) model was used to predict the spatial distribution of S. haematobium in relation to environmental and socio-economic factors. Significant S. haematobium cases and infection intensity clusters (p < 0.05) were observed. The s-GWR model performance was low (R 2 = 0.45) and its residuals did not show autocorrelation (Moran's I = -0.001; z-score = 0.003 and p value = 0.997) indicating that the model was correctly spelled. The coefficients for distances of homesteads from operational piped water collection points, distance from open water sources, religion, toilet use, household head and places of bath and laundry varied at local scale and were significant (t-values \u00b1 1.96) in some areas. This evidence may be used for control and management of the disease and further research is required to improve the performance of the s-GWR model. ",

Among other effects, climate change will increase extreme weather events that have the potential to impact the occurrence of vector borne diseases like dengue with a differential pattern of disease distribution according to local contexts. In this regard, vulnerability assessment is needed to analyze S96 Abstracts different aspects of complex ecological and social systems to intervene and reduce impacts on health. With this purpose, a fuzzy inference system was built including exposure, sensitivity, non-climatic factors and adaptive capacity in a comprehensive model. Data was obtained from primary and secondary sources from multiple sectors and vulnerability was estimated in 42 municipalities in the Cauca river geographical valley at South Western Colombia finding mostly high (69%) and medium (31%) levels of vulnerability. In particular this result is consequence of high exposure to extreme weather events (87%), medium level of sensitivity (59%), and average levels of adaptation capacity (89%) and non-climatic factors (78%). The processing system allowed to handle the imprecision and uncertainty associated with climate change in the case of dengue. However, given that vulnerability is changing over time, constant evaluation is required for building sound adaptation strategies that take into account local and global influences and consider conditions of local development. Leprosy, once an endemic human disease in the British Isles, arises from infection with Mycobacterium leprae or the recently discovered Mycobacterium lepromatosis, and remains a public health problem in certain low and middle-income countries with * 220,000 new cases reported annually. In 2014 we reported a novel mycobacterial dermatitis of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in Scotland, associated with infection with Mycobacterium lepromatosis, and histologically comparable with human diffuse lepromatous leprosy. Since then there have been increasing British reports of red squirrels presenting with leprosy, which we have investigated using genomics, histology and serology. We have now detected and genotyped leprosy bacilli in both overtly diseased and seemingly healthy squirrels from Scotland, England, and Ireland, including a large cluster from Brownsea Island, England where historic evidence indicates observation of affected animals for over forty years. Our findings show that red squirrels are a potential zoonotic source of leprosy and demonstrate that a pathogen can remain undetected in the environment centuries after its clearance from the human reservoir. Further surveys of animal reservoirs of leprosy bacilli are warranted since they may contribute to the inexplicably stubborn plateau in the incidence of the human leprosy epidemic despite effective and widespread treatment with multidrug therapy.",

We also propose indicators, based on individual-level and whole network measures, to characterize several key aspects of ecohealth research, such as gender issues, equity in participation, sustainability of the research results, levels of pluridisciplinarity, adaptive capacity to social and environmental changes, robustness and resilience of the knowledge generation processes. Indicators are illustrated and discussed using several ecohealth case studies, including community development projects, health promotion initiatives and international governance programs.",

Additionally, public perception of risk can result in food scares and reduced consumption in non zoonotic diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease. In order to trade internationally in animals and animal products reassurances are often required by importing countries regarding the freedom from contamination with zoonotic organisms with the potential to impact on human health. Robust surveillance systems, appropriate diagnostic tools, risk assessment and reliable certification arrangements are required to identify and manage risks associated with these infections and to provide the reassurances necessary to provide confidence to underpin both domestic and international trade.",

There are also many other barriers preventing the wider use of wild foods for food security. The Biodiversity for Food and Nutrition (BFN) Project, a multicountry project, has been working to address these challenges by improving the enabling environment for wild plant foods by: improving the evidence base for wild plants by undertaking composition analysis of about 150 prioritized species, based on their nutritional and socioeconomic potential; strategically targeting public policies and markets with the greatest potential for mainstreaming these species e.g. by diversifying public food procurement and school feeding; and, improving national capacity, partnerships and awareness through alliances with universities, governments, civil society, nutritionists and dieticians, chefs and national food movements. This presentation will demonstrate the benefits of a diversified diet that includes wild, nutritious species as well as how these species can be a source of work and income for family farmers.",

In contrast to municipal water supply systems which undergo routine testing and treatment, the responsibility of rural well water testing is left to private owners. Fewer than 10% of well owners in Alberta routinely test their well water. Distance to water testing facilities may be an important factor limiting well water sample submissions. This study describes the proximity of water wells to public health test facilities in the province. Using service area analysis, we determined the proportion of domestic wells within five impedances (15, 30, 45, 60, and >60 min) of test facilities. There were 19,102 water wells drilled for domestic use within Alberta during the period examined (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . One hundred and nine water public health test facilities were identified within the province. 7843 (41%), 7666 (40.1%), 2069 (10.8%), 437 (2%), and 1087 (6%) water wells were located within one-way travel times of 15, 30, 45, 60, and >60 min respectively of a water public health test facility.

Data was collected through Participatory Rural Appraisals, FGDs, KII, and observations. The engagement process included: (i) Extensive formative research activities such as PRAs (ii) Introductions to the political, traditional and administrative leaders, (iii) Establishing a community advisory mechanism through Community Advisory Boards, (iv) Community empowerment through education of ordinary community members at biannual meetings, training of community research assistants (CRA) and utilizing indigenous knowledge citizen science groups. Empowerment of CRAs and citizen science groups enabled the study to initiate sustainable community initiated research activities. High stakeholder and community involvement also ensured high research uptake even at policy level. It is possible to achieve the EcoHealth pillars through enhanced, deliberate CE. EcoHealth implementation should be consistent with community values and attitudes.

Driven by the primary target and passion to have communities healthier, wealthier and safe, the One Health Central and Eastern Africa (OHCEA) network has embarked on developing One Health Higher Education Systems in her 17-member university institutions. The objective is to produce a One Health graduate having transformative knowledge, ability, attitude and networking skills to prevent and mitigate risks that originate at the animal-human-ecosystems interface. To produce this graduate, universities are building four pillars, namely: A One Health university policy framework/strategy and implementation plan; One Health curricula through massive curriculum reviews to incorporate One Health competencies; One Health curriculum delivery mechanism; and One Health trainerstrainers capacitated in terms of One Health skills and facilities. This paper will provide a framework for building One Health curricula pillar and propose strategies on how the revised curricula can be delivered from a One Health perspective. In early 2009, a novel reassortant influenza A/H1N1 virus of swine origin caused a major outbreak in Mexico and quickly spread globally, resulting in the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Segments of the pandemic virus (pdmH1N1) are related to an avian-like Eurasian swine virus lineage (EAsw) that has never been identified in the Americas. It is therefore unclear how a virus that most likely evolved in Asian swine caused its first outbreak in humans in Mexico. In this talk I will describe how increased sequencing of influenza A viruses in swine globally since 2009 has advanced our understanding of the global ecology of the virus, including the key role of international trade of live swine in its intercontinental spread. I will introduce new data from Mexican swine that resolves the debate over whether the swine virus that gave rise to pdmH1N1 emerged in Asia or the Americas. Recognizing how long-distance viral migration driven by the animal trade has altered the global landscape of influenza virus diversity in swine in recent decades is key to identifying new geographical hotspots for the emergence of new pandemic viruses of swine origin. The Field Building Leadership Initiative (FBLI), supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), has been working to understand and address intensive agricultural practices and associated health risks in Southeast Asia and China. Developed jointly by research centres in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, and launched in 2012, this fiveyear initiative allows researchers and their partners to carry out research, capacity building, and knowledge translation to inform practice and policy. After 5 years of implementation, we report here the results of four research case studies conducted in 4 countries using an transdisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from the design phase to implementing interventions. Researchers and partners undertook research on a number of issues i) Pesticide use and its impact on human health and agricultural ecosystems in China; ii) Human and animal waste management in Vietnam; iii) Rubber plantations and vector-borne diseases in Thailand; and iv) Small-scale dairying in Indonesia. For capacity, a critical mass of teaching materials have been developed, students and ecohealth practitioner trained, in particular ecohealth future leaders trained widely in the region. Finally, we present how knowledge translation has been implemented to bring research evidences into policy and actions to improve health and environment.",

Landscapes and livelihoods are outcomes of complex human-ecosystem interactions. In the Brazilian Amazon, the landscape is a mosaic of rainforest, pasture, crops and growing urban areas. The diverse ways people make a living, known as livelihoods, often involves fishing, hunting, farming, and ranching. With on-going development in the region, however, livelihood options and the landscape are rapidly changing. In turn, this is altering the movement of toxins in the environment or the cycling of pathogens and disease vectors. Here, we demonstrate how landscapes and livelihoods can be used to integrate multiple health concerns into a common analysis that draws on interdisciplinarity and complexity thinking. We exemplify using two public health concerns in the Brazilian Amazon: one that is eco-toxicological (methylmercury exposure) and one that is vector-born (Chagas disease risk). Through an analysis of landscape patterns and livelihood activities, we highlight the complex, interrelated, and cross-scale social and ecological processes that drive the emergence of these two health concerns.

By early 2015, a control intervention in both the human and pigs had achieved a 78.7% reduction of adult parasite levels to 6.5% (95% C.I. 3.4-9.5%). Whilst epidemiological studies were key to demonstrating the overall goal of parasite reduction, careful consideration of diagnostic, anthropological and socioeconomic factors was necessary to balance community acceptability with scientific rigour and economic feasibility. Anthropological assessments flagged previously unknown transmission drivers -such as the significance of raw pork consumption for sacrificial ceremonies -highlighting the need to consider social realities in the design of community-level interventions. Similarly, the requirement to optimise cost effectiveness for policy purposes was a key motive for building soil transmitted helminths and classical swine fever control into the design from the outset. Garnering advocacy and action for disease control requires foresight into not just how diseases are transmitted, but how communities function and how policies are developed and funded. This pilot intervention showcases how transdisciplinarity contributes to the design, monitoring, evaluation -and ultimately the success -of ground level interventions.",

In this study, information gained from smallholder pig farmer/trader interviews was integrated with serological surveys for pig-associated zoonoses such as hepatitis E virus, Taenia solium and Trichinella to identify potential linkages between disease risk and pig production/slaughter in low input systems across the country. Trichinella and HEV exposure was high in both humans and pigs in both study areas, significantly associated with pig slaughter and the subsequent consumption and handling of raw pork products. T. solium demonstrated a strong geographical and ethnic association with the northern study area bordering Vietnam. With the right knowledge and accessible, affordable inputs, the majority of smallholder farmers indicated a willingness to increase economic investment in pig production, which could simultaneously improve livelihoods and decrease disease exposure through increased access to formal markets and improved slaughter processes.

This mixed-method research involves two phases aimed at identifying social and epidemiological factors influencing the uptake of recommended on-farm disease management measures. Content analysis of face-to-face interviews with 25 farmers revealed the influence of macro socio-economic conditions on famers' attitudes. A social ecological model was then developed to explain the complexity of factors affecting on-farm biosecurity practices with multilevel social structure. Survey data were collected from 303 farmers to understand the current situation of production processes. Using categorical principal components analysis and two-stage cluster analysis, two types of clusters were identified: attitude clusters (based on 15 variables) and behaviour clusters (characterised by 30 variables), and these findings suggested it is essential to apply appropriate and specified behavioural change theories to groups of farmers. The novelty of this research lies in its wider relevance to Taiwan's poultry production industry in that it identifies the shortcomings of focussing primarily on epidemiological risk factors and not including social factors, as tends to be the case in most animal disease control activities.",

There are efforts to enhance surveillance and risk assessment of influenza viruses at the animal-human interface so as to identify viruses of highest potential risk, so that pre-emptive steps to initiate development of candidate vaccine strains can be implemented allowing a head-start in the vaccine development process. Such risk assessments may also help identify animal viruses of the greatest concern, so that interventions may be instituted to minimize risk of pandemic emergence. Recently, influenza virus risk assessment strategies have been developed to make this process more systematized and transparent. These include the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) developed by the US CDC, the Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment (TIPRA) being developed by WHO with ''One-Health'' partners and FluRisk being developed with the European Food Safety Authority.

PEP administration practices by clinicians in high rabies-risk areas were investigated to target PEP more precisely to people with a genuine risk of rabies exposure, avoiding excessive precautionary use. Health workers used a structured questionnaire whilst observing clinician-patient interviews to assess 276 suspected rabies exposure cases by 52 clinicians within 13 district and subdistrict hospitals. This provided evidence of the risk of rabies exposure associated with different forms of dog exposure, leading to development of a classification system which can be used to guide decisions on which patients should receive PEP. The national PEP guidelines will now be revised and training materials developed for clinicians. Savings from reducing PEP expenditure can potentially be diverted to reducing exposure of people through enhanced rabies control effort in dogs in the high-risk areas, further reducing the need for PEP by adopting an integrated One Health control policy.",

These strategies include education and targeted awareness campaigns for specific risk groups, environmental modification and control in reservoir populations such as rodents and livestock. To address this, in 2013-2014, the Fijian Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MOHMS) initiated the development of a national strategy that involved two multi-sectoral consultation workshops to define issues and identify solutions. Consultation around the national strategy used institutional advocacy to develop a governance structure and interventions to meet the needs of the different stakeholders. A University of Queensland research collaboration, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, undertook a series of interviews with stakeholders to identify measures of disease impact that would facilitate multi-sectoral planning. Despite demonstrable inter-sectoral impact, their conceptualisation of the problem focused only on human morbidity and mortality.

The average dietary GHGe were 18.72 \u00b1 12.06 and 13.73 \u00b1 8.72 kgCO 2 e/day for male and female adults respectively. The correlation between total energy and GHGe was r = 0.54 (p < 0.001). Core foods contributed 68.4% and discretionary foods 29.4% to GHGe. Of the core foods, fresh meat and alternatives (33.9%) and discretionary foods (29.4%) were the highest contributors. The modelling of current dietary patterns showed the contribution of GHGe from discretionary foods was 121% greater in the average diet and 307% greater in the 'lower quality, higher GHGe' dietary pattern compared to the recommended diet. Reducing discretionary food intake would allow for small increases in emissions from core foods (in particular vegetables, dairy and grains), thereby providing a nutritional benefit at little environmental expense.

Elimination programs are challenged by the porous border with India. Cross border animal movement results in rabies outbreaks in cattle and other livestock along the border. While rabies control in dogs is implemented through regular mass vaccination and sterilization, no prevention measures are advocated for cattle. Consequently, outbreaks in cattle are increasingly reported resulting in direct and indirect economic losses due to loss of animals and costs of human post exposure treatment. In this preliminary study, we evaluated the economic benefits of vaccinating cattle in two high risk sub-districts located in southern Bhutan. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) ranged from 2.1 to 9.8 for various case scenarios. We calculated BCR for three scenarios: BCR = 2.1 for vaccinating cattle at Government expense; BCR = 5 when farmers are willing to bear vaccine costs; and BCR = 9.8 when farmers bear vaccine costs and delivery combined with other vaccination campaigns. Therefore, we conclude that vaccinating cattle against rabies can be economically beneficial in high risk areas of Bhutan and thus can be advocated as a measure to prevent rabies in cattle. However, further work is required. Most current modeling techniques do not cater for other socio-ecological drivers of cholera other than climatic factors; neither produce a portfolio of optimal cost-efficient interventions. We propose a Decision-Focused, Information-Centric, and Technology-prone (DIT) model for cholera forecast and optimal management. The model aims at (i) mapping endemic and epidemic areas, identifying fundamental socio-environmental drivers and their interactions, and determine the universality of these drivers; (ii) identifying potential recurrence time of outbreaks and performing multi-scale predictions over space and time; and (iii) defining optimal controls for decreasing population incidence by quantifying the budget to be allocated to different ecosystem controls that consider health outcomes. The model is constructed on an entropy-/network-based variance decomposition principle. It is built for maximizing prediction accuracy in cholera dynamics. It predicts spatiotemporal weekly patterns of incidence with an average accuracy -for two weeks before the outbreaks occurrence -of 92, 85, 84 and 72% for the peak timing, geographical distribution, total cases, and peak magnitude, respectively. The model carries a Value of Information that is superior to current models. It enables the prediction of triggering criteria for public health control strategies with increased accuracy. The DIT model is effective for both science and public health decision-making.",

Results obtained map, categorize and quantify the degree of responsibility of non-health sectors on vulnerability to a specific disease.

The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves has set a goal of introducing clean cooking technology into 100 million homes around the world by 2020, as part of a massive global effort to modernize household energy use. This generally well-conceived effort dovetails with at least five of the Sustainable Development Goals, including health, environment, and social empowerment objectives. However, most clean cooking programs around the world are still driven by climate change mitigation objectives and financed, at least in part, by carbon credits. The result is that the overwhelming majority of the nearly 49 million households that have participated since the goal was established in 2010 are using relatively low-tech improved cookstoves that burn solid fuels more efficiently, but yield minimal health benefits. A strategic focus on clean fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas or ethanol, rather than improved biomass stoves will provide significantly greater benefits to all five relevant Sustainable Development Goals.",

In these complex adaptive systems, processes are not linear, and there is no 'control' or 'determinants'. Rather, one seeks to understand important patterns and risks, and to build adaptive capacity and resilience. This presentation canvasses the opportunities of thinking about One Health concerns in a socialecological systems way, and what a 'resilience' goal might entail. It canvasses the influences of globalisation, which has altered people's customary relationships with wild animals, livestock and companion animals through increased world trade and travel and land clearing; and of poverty, which can involve high dependence on natural resources, high vulnerability to disease and low resistances, high impact of control measures and particular communication challenges. Ecological resilience focuses on the ability to withstand shocks, and social resilience on the strengths that assist a society to do so. What cultural, cognitive and institutional strengths do we need to consider to build resilience and adaptive capacity in relevant societies and environments, and in One Health's preparation and response systems?",

This study investigated the ecology of the snails in four rivers in uMkhanyakude district to determine the influence of draught duration on snail survival and breeding. Aestivation patterns in Biomphalaria pffeifferi and Bulinus globosus were studied by first monitoring changes in snail population structure during the period when the habitats were flooded and then digging transects across the floor of their dried habitats at specified points for 12 months. A wide size range for both species was found to aestivate. Successfully aestivated snail numbers significantly declined for the first 3 months after the drying of the river beds. The longest period of aestivation for B. globosus snails was 8 months while that of B. pfeifferi was 6 months. More snails were found at the river banks compared to the centre of the riverbeds suggesting they preferred sheltering themselves among the vegetation and did not necessarily follow the receding waters. This study showed that aestivation ability declines with time and occurred in the first 5 cm from the surface.",

Some of world's best Universities use MOOCs to share their knowledge with a global community of learners, opening unprecedented opportunities for career development. MOOCs are increasingly used for dissemination of policy recommendations, as seen during the climate crisis or the Ebola epidemic. The Institute of Global Health (IGH) has produced several MOOCs with an innovative interdisciplinary approach, part of International Geneva's identity (e.g. MOOC on Ebola involved 38 experts from 20 institutions). This approach has a potential added value in terms of the diversity of roles and perspectives needed for these complex global health challenges. In December 2016, we launch on Coursera a new MOOC on Global Health at the Human-Animal-Ecosystem Interface: Interdisciplinary Overview. It is co-produced by the IGH and Institut Pasteur involving also a diversity of experts from other academic institutions, international organisations (e.g. WHO) etc. It will be free and open, targeting primarily an interdisciplinary audience interested in human-animal-ecosystem health interface. Besides its primary educative objective, the MOOC will become a platform for interdisciplinary discussions, encounters online but also offline in different parts of the world (e.g. Meetup, Hackathon), as well as participatory research (Massive Open Online Research). One of the greatest challenges to improving health in Africa has been a lack of long-term and systemic engagement of various stakeholders in vulnerable communities. Interventions are often vertical and intermittent and, often instigated by a crisis. Community capacity is impeded by persistent exposure to complex public health problems not addressed by vertical interventions, including food and water insecurity, the effects of climate change, unsustainable natural resources, and political conflict and mobile populations. The One Health Central and Eastern Africa (OHCEA) network of universities is building on this model of long-term engagement to establish a regional network of One Health Demonstration Sites in six countries to address complex health problems faced by communities. The presentation will show community identified priorities and ranked for future interventions in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) in Uganda. Priorities were identified using an Ecohealth approach whereby communities participated in identifying, ranking and prioritizing health and environmental challenges in their population(s), as tell as the variables that drive poor health in humans and animals and/or contribute to environmental degradation. In QENP, traditional pastoralist communities have been forced to become semi-sedentary and, in some places, completely displaced and forced into national parks and other conservation areas because of lack of pastures, watering points and loss of land to agriculturists. Fishing communities have stayed in and around national parks to exploit lakes within these conservation areas. This has led to a perceived increase in humanwildlife conflict in these areas. Interaction between wildlife-domestic animals and humans is relatively higher within fishing enclaves than in surrounding communities. This scenario leads to increased zoonotic diseases, environmental degradation and global change.",

We collected blood and tissue samples from cachectic cattle and goats from August 2014 through September 2015 from two abattoirs and a veterinary hospital. We collected sputum from workers and traders at a cattle market and from patients at two government chest diseases hospitals who had history of animal exposure. Blood specimens were tested by ELISA for antibodies to M. bovis. Animal tissue and sputum specimens were screened for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and cultured for Mycobacterium spp. Overall, 393 animals and 412 humans were sampled. No animal specimens were positive for M. bovis antibodies, AFB or Mycocobacterium spp. Twenty-five (6%) human sputum specimens were positive for AFB, 43 (10%) for M. tuberculosis and none for other Mycobacterium spp. No evidence of current or past infection with M. bovis in animals or humans was found. No evidence of M. bovis may be due to sampling mostly indigenous/native animal which are less susceptible to M bovis infection than exotic. Further assessment of zoonotic TB in areas of Bangladesh with high levels of exotic animal-human interaction and human TB is important. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are vector-borne zoonotic parasitic diseases, with more than 2,000,000 new cases/year worldwide. The current control measures have relatively low effectiveness or there are culturally or ecologically unsound. This project look for the social and biological drivers of risk on the Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay border, and Uruguay (IDRC-PAHO). The locations and domestic units visited were around 500 to perform sampling of vectors, dogs, rodent activity, ecological surveys and social interviews. The main outcomes were: (1) The characterization of VL spread and CL risk, with parasite genotypification from humans, vectors, and animal reservoirs (dogs). (2) The spatial segregation of the vectors of each leishmaniasis, associated with variables that could allow the modelling of its distribution in time and space. (3) The evidence-based delimitation of an area for environmental interventions of 400 9 400 m. (4) The social modulators of risk, mainly of VL and canine VL, due to the human-dog inter-specific relationship and consequent ways of management. Currently we are integrating the multidisciplinary results an to promote an intersectoral discussion in order to develop alternative and feasible strategies of surveillance, prevention and control of leishmaniases in a healthy environment.",

Sixty percent of the population live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. The raising of small and large ruminants, donkeys and village poultry is crucial due to poor cropping conditions. Generally, women have responsibility for small ruminants and village poultry with men taking most interest in large ruminants and donkeys. In a mixed methods study of a survey and focus group discussion, involving 120 households in the Kiang East District, competition between livestock species for pasture, fodder and crop residues was well recognised. Our research also highlighted the associated competition between men and women in relation to which animals could access crop residues and how these animals were used within households. Both men and women tended to rear small ruminants for the purpose of household consumption and finance. Other problems raised by women include inadequate access to grazing land, lack of capital to purchase feed supplements and lack of adequate know-how. Our findings demonstrated that despite women 's significant role in small ruminant production, they still lack adequate support to improve their contribution to household food security. There is more to be learned about how aid programs focused on pandemics and emerging infectious diseases (PEID) influence country health systems, both animal and human and the interface between them. This paper presents findings from a major evaluation conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of Australia's efforts to reduce the risk of PEIDs across Asia and the Pacific between 2006 and 2015. Led by DFAT's Office of Development Effectiveness, the evaluation covered 30 initiatives, worth over $190 million and included data collected from fieldwork in Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Australia. Drawing on current understandings of health systems strengthening and on the WHO's International Health Regulations and OIE Performance of Veterinary Services, we assess the impact of these investments on country health systems. By exploring implementation characteristics and outcomes achieved in different contexts, we identify 'what works for whom and in what circumstances' in building stronger health systems, and linkages between animal and human health systems. Implications of the findings for future investments in this area will be discussed.",

This paper examines evidence from the 2014 Regional Wellbeing Survey, in which 5,000 Australians were asked about the types of green spaces and natural spaces they spent time in, and whether they experienced any of a number of factors considered likely to moderate or mediate the wellbeing benefits of spending time in these places.

Going under many labels, including biodynamic, organic, regenerative, holistic and natural sequence farming, these farming practices are argued to be better not only for the environment but also for the farmer. While the environmental benefits of these practices have been established to some extent, the claims made regarding the benefits of these farming practices for the wellbeing of agricultural households have not. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the wellbeing of farmers engaging in these practices, based on a survey of 3,000 Australian farmers conducted as part of the annual Regional Wellbeing Survey. It examines whether alternative farming practices are associated with improved health and wellbeing for farmers compared to traditional farming practices, and in what circumstances. Based on this, the authors proposed a new approach to classifying alternative agricultural practices that focuses not only on their environmental outcomes but which uses a socio-ecological systems approach to classify them based on social, economic and environmental outcomes. A vaccination program targeting children has reduced the incidence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in endemic areas of Nepal. However JE risk is expanding from the lowland terai regions into higher altitudes, exposing new human populations to the mosquito vector, Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Pigs are important amplifying hosts, but their distribution within Nepal is influenced by the religious and ethnic composition of local communities. Movement of viraemic pigs into areas where there is sufficient density of the mosquito vector may contribute to the expansion of JE risk areas. Spatial data on pig density, altitude, precipitation, humidity, temperature and land use were combined to create a JE risk map which identified the expanded areas in which JE was likely to occur. The variation in risk was then used to adjust disease transmission in a spatially explicit stochastic model of JE in HandiSpread, which models virus transmission in pigs and vectors, and the exposure of people to the virus. Model parameters were informed through a social network analysis of pig movements conducted in an example area of Nepal where risk of JE is increasing. Cost-effectiveness analysis was used in conjunction with epidemiological predictions from the model to assess potential changes in current control policies.",

Meteorological data were extracted from the database of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society. As for the malaria data, they were collected in public and private health facilities in the city of Korhogo. The analysis of rainfall and temperature data related to the number of malaria cases permit to establish the link between climate and malaria. The correlations (r) are relatively average between rainfall and the incidence of malaria of same month (r = 0.30), of first month (r = 0.42) and of second month following (r = 0.50). The registered determination coefficients (R 2 between 9% and 25%) indicate that in addition to the climate, other factors are involved in malaria transmission. The temperature maintains a negative relationship with malaria and explains 10.89% of malaria cases (r = -0.33 and R 2 = 10.89%). These observations could help decision makers anticipate the importance of mortality attributed to malaria in Korhogo. This study assesses human exposure to pesticides at intensive soybean production areas, located in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. With a cross-sectional study design, we measured the enzyme activity for plasmatic butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as biomarkers of human exposure, at local and small-scale agricultural households living around huge soybean crops, during two key sampling periods: February 2015 (fumigation period) and August 2015 (non-fumigation period). Plasmatic BuChE activity was determined by Doles\u00d2 commercial kits, following Brazilian Regulations. A socio-demographic, environmental, health, and occupational questionnaire was applied to 82 villagers, both adult men and women, who read and signed an informed consent form. BuChE activity averaged 9.4 \u00b1 2.7 UI/mL in August (median: 9.2; range: 3.0-15.8 UI/mL) and 5.4 \u00b1 1.9 UI/mL (median: 5.0; range: 1.7-11.7 UI/mL) in February. Paired comparative analyses for a subsample of 38 persons indicate an averaged 39.2% BuchE inhibition (range: 0-80%), where 12 persons (31.6% of the subsample) present BuChE inhibition 50%, 27 persons (71.1%) show BuChE inhibition 30%, and 29 persons (76.3%) reveal BuChE inhibition 25%, with many study participants self-reporting toxic symptoms typical of acute pesticide exposures.

In 2010, an outbreak of lead poisoning among artisanal mining communities in Northern Nigeria lead to the deaths of approximately 400 children, and permanent sequelae in large segments of the population. Recognized as the most severe acute mass lead poisoning in recorded medical history, the outbreak is a signal incident that illustrates the broader health and ecological implications of small-scale mining and other informal industrial practices done in situations of economic and social marginality. This presentation provides a summation of the outbreak and the public health and environmental insights that emerged. In recent years, rising international prices for precious minerals have led to a global boom in informal extractive industries. While sometimes portrayed as entrepreneurial and emancipatory, these activities occur at the margins of governmental influence, with little attention paid to personal or environmental protections and often in a context of exploitation. These industrial hazards can be subtle and pervasive, thus the health and environmental effects for individuals and societies can unfold imperceptibly, to emerge on a global and generational scale. The Egyptian fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is a reservoir host for Marburg virus (MARV). Characterising the antibody responses of reservoir hosts may provide insights into which antibodies may be important for protection against infection, and which proteins to target for diagnosis and surveillance. Additionally, determining when juvenile bats lose maternal immunity may assist in predicting spill-over events into human and animal populations, as loss of immunity in juveniles increases susceptibility of bat populations to MARV infection. We determined the serological responses of Rousettus aegyptiacus to structural MARV proteins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In experimentally infected bats, antibodies against the glycoprotein (GP) steadily waned after peaking at 12 days post-infection, while antibodies against the nucleoprotein (NP) reached a plateau between days 12 and 42 post-infection. Results in field collected sera showed the presence of anti-NP antibody in the absence of anti-GP antibody, inferring that anti-GP immunity might have waned below detectable levels at the time of sample collection. The nucleoprotein might therefore be a better immunoreagent for surveillance studies aimed at assessing past exposure to MARV in Rousettus aegyptiacus. In juveniles, maternal anti-GP and anti-NP antibodies were lost within 3 to 5 months after birth. This information will assist in predicting and preventing future spill-over events.",

The inhabitants have demonstrated exceptional resilience through the creation of local non-governmental organizations and the building of rural development plans. By partnering with these groups, we are working together to develop adaptation strategies to tackle climate change and community health. One approach we use is to combine archival and geochemical analysis to reconstitute the evolving communities of the Cocagne River Watershed from the beginning of industrialization to the present day. Specifically, we have reconstituted the local population with the Canadian Censuses and sampled aquatic sediment cores in order to reconstruct ecosystem changes through indicators of aquatic productivity and the presence of metals. Thus, we use two types of data (archival and biogeochemical) towards the same goal of understanding how land use practices impact ecosystem health and community resilience. Our findings highlight the vulnerability and the resilience of small communities in constant change. Better understanding of past adaptations as well as local culture allow us to propose specific coastal adaptation policies to increase health and wellbeing of communities.",

The autonomous nature of Indonesia's sub-national government administrations since 2001 required novel engagement methods to ensure local ownership of central government-led animal disease control programmes. The participatory disease surveillance and response (PDSR) system was established in 31 of Indonesia's 34 provinces to detect, report and respond to HPAI. A One Health (OH) approach was successfully fostered between animal health PDSR staff and human health service district surveillance officers to collaborate in joint investigation of HPAI outbreaks and monitor human exposuresnear animal cases; however lack of sufficient district animal health staff hampers this. While cross-sectoral engagement worked well at the district and sub-district level, the collaborative relationship proved more challenging at the higher provincial and central government hierarchical levels. The function of coordinating zoonotic disease control across line ministries was assigned to a National Committee on Pandemic and Avian Influenza/zoonoses control. In order to make One Health work more effectively in Indonesia closer hierarchical alignment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health zoonotic disease control entities and higher investment in veterinary authority are required.",

Up to present 61 human deaths was recorded in 5 (five) districts in Nias Island, and many of that cases occurred in children. In addition to mass dog vaccination activities to control the disease, public awareness campaign on rabies transmission and prevention for children are employed to increase the knowledge and awareness of school age children on rabies. Since June 2014 to May 2016, a total of 176 schools were visited and 24,325 students had participated in this program. To see the effect of program, a pre-and post-test was conducted, and resulted in a 75.8% increase of knowledge in participated children.

While both programmes are run separately, each has a curriculum with a strong One Health (OH) dimension. In addition, joint training sessions are conducted regularly involving trainees from both programmes. These include an introductory course on OH and joint workshops on the zoonotic diseases epidemiology and control. During both training programmes, professionals from both sectors are involved are involved in discussing and exchanging ideas, and collaborating in field work whenever possible, based on a common understanding of OH concepts and approaches gained from the trainings. Through 'learning by doing', the two programs also facilitate and synergize resources for joint field investigation and intervention for trainees and graduates. As a result, cross-sector cooperation will become more effective, also facilitated by the professional and personal relationships established during the training programme. These joint approaches are necessary for dealing with the continued emergence of high impact zoonotic diseases that have national, regional and global impact. The 'Ebola Economic Impact' study uses a mixed method approach to document the impacts of the 2014-15 Ebola Virus Disease outbreak on the operations of a mining firm in Liberia and estimate the costs of the preventative measures taken by the firm. The study focuses on a single large extractive firm in Liberia and proposes a framework for assessing the operational resilience of the firm. A total of 20 in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions were conducted to identify what key employees understood as the impacts on the firm and its operations. The qualitative data indicated the most critical aspects of operations that were impacted in terms of operations, supply chain impacts and the expansion plans for additional mining capacity as well as impacts on daily activities due to the additional preventative measures. The interview data was used to determine the historical context to the financial data that was collected from key departments of the firm. The economic costs of the preventive measures as incurred by the firm were estimated to be between $10.58-11.11 S128 Abstracts million. The magnitude of actual costs incurred by the firm largely conforms to the perceived costs impacts identified by the respondents in the qualitative study. Since the 1970s, large-scale irrigation systems in Peru's North coast have enabled a huge expansion of rice cultivation. Irrigation also brought malaria to the region. A pilot ecohealth research showed that Intermittent Rice Irrigation (IRI) could achieve a 90% mosquitoes decrease in rice paddies, but also higher rice yields and a 30-60% reduction in water use. The research aimed at characterizing farmers' perception on the social, health, environmental, and economic advantages and trade-offs associated with the adoption of IRI and to understand the role of information exchange networks in the scaling-up of the irrigation technique at the watershed level. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in April 2016, with 368 farmers, 311 men and 57 women, distributed throughout the Jequetepeque watershed. Data included farmers' characteristics, interpersonal communication on agriculture and health, and perceptions of advantages and trade-offs of adopting IRI. Preliminary analyses showed that men value the economic advantages of IRI, while women establish linkages between the new practices and their health benefits. Information on IRI circulates through two distinct gender-specific diffusion pathways. Furthermore adoption for men is associated with participation in communication networks on agriculture, while discussing health is linked to women's adoption. Implications for scaling-up ecohealth interventions are discussed.",

Introduction of human seasonal IAVs into domestic pigs contributes to the diversity of swine influenza viruses due to the propensity for IAV genes to reassort in pigs. IAV strains tend to subclinically circulate in swine herds, undergoing minimal change for decades, and thus pose an ongoing pandemic risk to the human population that may be immunologically na\u00efve to swine strains of virus. Following the 2009 emergence of the reassortant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) in people, together with the potential for reassortment of avian, human and swine influenza viruses in pigs, there has been an urgent call for increased global surveillance of IAV strains in pigs. In Australia in 2012, reassortant strains of H3N2 and H1N2 with pH1N1 genes caused respiratory outbreaks in Australian piggeries, indicating the likely endemic presence of novel swine IAV in Australian domestic pig populations.

Most food security questionnaires focus on purchased food. However, many Indigenous and remote communities consume a diet that combines foods from the store and traditional foods obtained from the local environment. This study describes the psychometric evaluation of a modified Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), which was developed for mixed economies, to assess food insecurity among pregnant Inuit participants. A modified HFIAS was administered to 131 pregnant women in Nunavik, Canada. Data were fit to a Rasch Rating Scale Model (RSM) to estimate the construct validity. The RSM was a good fit for the data (Infit MSV = .667 to 1.313); however, items primarily assessed moderate levels of food insecurity. A scoring system was developed based on the RSM to improve the scale's accuracy. Addressing food insecurity among Indigenous people requires rigorous, culturally adapted instruments that capture availability, access, quality and utilization of market and traditional food sources. The modified HFIAS shows potential for measuring Indigenous food insecurity. Future studies should integrate specific items about traditional foods. Accurate, culturally appropriate measurements are necessary to understand and support the sustainability of Indigenous food systems and environments.",

Between 2014-2016 the Health Nature and Sustainability Research Group, Deakin University, Melbourne, undertook a deliberative program to both profile and model sustainability action within the University's largest campus through two research programs focused on food. This action speaks directly to the social and cultural determinants of health as a means of simultaneously influencing these determinants for positive health and imbuing them with sustainability content. Firstly a feasibility study returned over 500 positive responses to the establishment of a campus based community garden. Critical mass lead to the formation of a student sustainable food society. Following two years of campaigning, the university approved a campus based community garden in early 2016. A second research investigated the ''food culture'' promulgated across the campus through a survey of staff, student and food outlets and an audit of facilities for food preparation, storage and disposal. Findings revealed hidden food insecurity, dissatisfaction with campus based food options and an ineffective recycling of food waste. Yes In My Back Yard (YIMBY) actions to positively address these concerns and influence the social and cultural determinants of health are being pursued. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) was the most often reported disease in terms of number of alerts submitted by countries to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) between 2005 and 2015. Knowledge of HPAI viruses' dynamics is important in the prevention of their further spread. To perform such analysis, the OIE World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) is the global reference source for confirmed information. The aim of the paper is to describe the global dynamics of HPAI viruses over the last 11 years, their capability in terms of spread and speed in order to enhance the capacity of predicting and managing epidemics. An increase in the number of affected countries and the circulating virus subtypes was observed in recent years. The analysis considered 6,546 outbreaks belonging to 289 events (epidemiologically related outbreaks) in 73 countries between 2005 and 2015. The median spread value from the index outbreak was 131 km and the median speed value was 2.4 km/day. Significantly higher median values were registered when wild birds were involved: 223 vs 131 km for spread and 11.7 vs 1.7 km/day for speed. Spread and speed results variations over time were described and discussed.",

As our awareness of the vulnerability of human health to practices affecting animal and environmental wholesomeness grows, so must we revisit our approach to managing risks. Discrete risk management must give way to an integrated approach. The ''One Health'' concept has at its core the recognition of the symbiotic relationships among humans, animals and the world in which we dwell. Like other places, Hong Kong embraces a ''One Health'' approach to tackling zoonotic diseases and safeguarding public health. The last two decades have seen the increasing integration of veterinary with public health expertise in policy making and in tackling food incidents and threats of infectious diseases. Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions where the oversight for both animal and human health is put under one policy roof. Over the years, there have been occasional AI and food safety incidents. We follow up each with a rigorous review of our strategy and operational procedures. No review is complete without the involvement of both veterinary and public health expertise. Looking back, we have come a long way. Still, our system is far from perfect. Safeguarding humans and animals from zoonotic diseases and reaching the lofty food safety target of ''from farm to table'' is an uphill task. The real world comprises more than just veterinary and public health personnel. Nor is the veterinary and public health sector an island-its proper functioning relies on many other players. As we globalize exchanges of all sorts, threats to human and animal health also transcend jurisdictional boundary. International collaboration is not only desirable, it is essential. These put the ''One Health'' concept in an even broader perspective. The concomitant diversity of perceptions, interests, values and cultures is what we must grapple with. With illustrations drawn from our experience in handling a number of food safety and infectious disease incidents, Hong Kong would like to share our reflections on the practice of ''One Health'' that must encompass, but also go well beyond, our local veterinary and public health sector.",

From an interdisciplinary research perspective and documented using outcome harvesting/mapping, PigRISK builds capacity on assessing health risks, value chains and also enhances collaboration among teams. This was achieved through providing the opportunity for researchers to work ''day to day'' across disciplines and institutions, a new experience for most of them.

In total, 274/1654 (22%) cases tested positive: 249 (20%) horses, 6 (4.3%) livestock and 19 (7%) wildlife. Among horses, WNV was most frequently identified (n = 96; 38.5%%;34% fatal) followed by EEV)(n = 73;5.9%;13.7% fatal) Middelburg-(MIDV) (n = 77;29.3%;33.8% fatal), Shuni-(SHUV)(n = 23;23.9%;52.2% fatal), Sindbis-(n = 23;23.9%;10% fatal) and Wesselsbronvirus (n = 2;2%;50% fatal). Of 19 positive wildlife cases, 15 (78.9%) were fatal. Wildlife tested positive for Middelburg (n = 10; 52.6%, 80% fatal); SHUV (n = 4;21%,100% fatal), Sindbis (n = 5; 26.3%;100% fatal) and EEV (n = 1;5.2%; 100% fatal). Positive species included buffalo, rhinoceros, sable, giraffe, warthogs, crocodiles, lion and genet. Of 141 livestock tested 5 Middelburg (80% fatal) and 2 WNV (100% fatal) cases were identified in cattle. Cases occurred primarily from February-June, peaking in March throughout the country following peak rainfall. Geographic location of veterinarians seropositive for WNV and SHUV identified in a serosurvey in 2010-2011 correlated with animal cases suggesting these arboviruses are widespread in the country and should be considered in animal and human neurological disease.",

Blood and swap samples were also collected for molecular screening of filoviruses. Our findings indicate that bats in Cameroon are illegally hunted for human consumption with high biorisk of viral spread to human. Age estimate was based on wing measurements. Global Positioning System (GPS) chips were fixed on the neck of some colony-distributionbased bats for geo-monitoring at the national and international transboundary levels using computer software system. This geo-surveillance allowed monitoring of bats movement in the countries with some colonies crossing international borders to Nigeria and Chad. Laboratory screening of 298 sampled bats using 'RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR Kit' indicate total absence of Ebola and Marburg viruses in Cameroon.

Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which most (if not all) other known mammalian viruses of livestock animals and human were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further proof, the fact that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the focus of research in our research group for the past few years.

The impact of a rabies incursion on domestic dog and dingo populations could be enormous, and would cause health impacts and social disruption within indigenous communities. Beginning 2012, a research program was initiated to investigate how rabies might spread to northern Australia and its potential impact. It has focused on incursion pathways and risk assessment in PNG, the Torres Strait and Cape York Peninsula. The demographics of free roaming dog populations within indigenous communities on the tip of Cape York Peninsula have been studied intensively, using sight-resight methods, GPS and video collars, genetics and questionnaire surveys. Estimation of the size and distribution of surrounding wild dog and dingo populations has recently commenced, using motion-activated cameras and genetics. To inform plans for response and control, risk assessment and disease spread models are being developed.

Using participatory approaches to socioeconomic and environmental research the Aboriginal Partnerships team at the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) are developing tools with Aboriginal Nations to communicate the value of environmental water in terms consistent with Chapter 10 Part 14 of the Basin Plan. There is a direct relationship between environmental water and cultural, natural, physical, financial, social and human assets. But how can this connection be convincingly explained to non-Aboriginal decision-makers in the water game? Will arguments about Ancestral rights result in allocations of water substantial enough to redress injustices and drive self-determination? Representatives of the Partnership will present findings from an extensive literature review regarding the dimensions of health and wellbeing that are evident in the many ways in which Aboriginal Nations relate to their Country. Drawing on these insights they will then foreshadow a new five-year inquiry into the social impacts of the ultimate source of environmental water, the weather, on Aboriginal lives in the Basin. Diets are crucial for the environment and for health. We examine co-benefits from changes in diet using Austria as case study. As a novel aspect, our analysis covers the entire causal chain from feasibility of implementing a policy via the effectiveness of the measures, their impacts on diets, up to the resulting climate and health benefits. Leverage points for achieving co-benefits are examined with two scenarios and benchmarked against the baseline year. The scenarios focus on reducing meat intake, known to yield strongest effects. The happier animal scenario (HA) introduces recommended animal welfare standards. Additionally, the healthier people scenario (HP) implements a meat tax used to subsidize fruits and vegetables. The results reveal that meat intake can be reduced by 20% (HA) and 50% (HP) leading to a 26% and 60% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions respectively (2 and 5 million tons/year, calculated as 50 years average). The health benefits show strongest effects in overall mortality in the HP-scenario, where 110.000 life years are saved annually. The incidences of colon cancer and diabetes decline by 10% and 15% respectively. The study stresses the importance of integrated policies that strive for both protecting the climate and promoting health.",

Factors required for infectious disease transmission to occur between species are usually inferred after serious outbreaks but typically go unnoticed and rely on observable disease and its notification. We investigated populations on the border of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in southwestern Uganda where endangered mountain gorillas, human and livestock interactions have resulted in transmission of zoonoses and reverse zoonoses, sometimes with serious consequences such as with scabies mortality in critically endangered gorillas. Faecal samples from mountain gorillas, regional cattle and clinicallyunwell humans were analysed by next-generation sequencing to evaluate for viral, bacterial, protozoan and parasitic pathogen presence. We hypothesized that pathogens would be shared between these populations, but that particular host (e.g. relatedness) and pathogen traits (e.g. occupying the gastrointestinal tract niche) and ecological processes (e.g. contact rates) would drive different infection-sharing patterns. Preliminary analyses using k-mer based motif searches revealed similar pathogen signatures in samples from humans, mountain gorillas and cattle. Putative pathogen motifs were either shared between humans and cattle or humans and gorillas, suggesting both contact rates and host phylogeny may be important factors in facilitating pathogen sharing.",

Contributory factors include global warming, people movement, urbanisation, and the diminishing effectiveness of traditional vector control methods. Despite a well-established national dengue control programme, including comprehensive mosquito control and rigorous public health education conducted in all four official languages, the disease is endemic in Singapore-a vibrant business hub and tourist destination. Our recent investigation amongst a segment of the Japanese residents in Singapore, have revealed insufficiency in both knowledge of the disease and frequency of preventative actions taken. It is possible that the abundant information disseminated by the Singapore government has neither reached this demographic, nor been properly understood. We thus conducted outreach efforts in January 2016, involving 1,105 Japanese schoolchildren, to highlight the important linkage between ecology and public health. Our ecological education included the life cycle of mosquitoes in relation to the environment, and the effects of environmental parameters and climate change, employing talks, posters, videos and live mosquito exhibits. Such education is imperative for raising environmental awareness, and encouraging schoolchildren to become advocates of anti-dengue measures, to thus share the importance of source reduction and the role that each individual can play.",

The goal of this USAID-supported program is to utilize deep phenotyping combined with advanced genomic selection to sustainably enhance innate resistance to ND and heat stress in indigenous African chickens to improve production. Genes and signal pathways associated with genetic resistance to NDV infection and heat stress were identified by RNA sequencing in well-established ND-resistant and susceptible inbred lines in the US by challenging chickens with a lentogenic ND virus strain in temperate or hot environments. Six African chicken ecotypes and one commercial layer line widely used in Africa were challenged. The chicken 600 K SNP chip was used to identify SNP or regions associated with resistance to NDV and heat stress. Enhanced resistant birds will be selected and bred for distribution to smallholder farmers and households.

More than 64 viruses were detected in 268 animals (bats, rodents and non-human primates), and 75% of these viruses were from bat hosts. In addition to investigating connections between people and key taxa like bats that harbor diverse viruses, we also focused on the viral transmission risks associated with common routes of contact with diverse wildlife taxa, like hunting and examined practices associated with bushmeat hunting, targeting villages bordering the Ruaha ecosystem.

Faecal samples from 38 three-days old piglets (12 untreated piglets in control pens, 14 treated and 12 untreated piglets in treatment pens) from a commercial farm with no previous use of TGCs were investigated to evaluate the impact of a long-acting TGC injection (Ceftiofur) on cefotaxime resistance in commensal E. coli. Faecal swabs were collected at 7 time-points over a 22-day period from piglets, their dams (8 sows) and environment. Samples were screened for the presence of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli using TBX agar supplemented with cefotaxime according to EUCAST guidelines.All E. coli isolates screened during the trial were cefotaxime-susceptible suggesting that single use of TGC on a na\u00efve farm does not increase the number of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli detected. The Australian pig industry often uses antibiotics at weaning for treatment of diarrhoea in piglets caused by Escherichia coli. Our aim was to isolate E. coli from healthy and sick piglets to determine resistance to third generation cephalosporin antibiotics (3GC) used in veterinary medicine (e.g. ceftiofur). A survey was conducted in 22 commercial piggeries in South Eastern Australia (New South Wales n = 9; Victoria n = 10; and South Australia n = 3) from September 2013 to May 2014. From each herd, 10 pre-and 40 post-weaned piglet faceal samples were spread onto Sheep blood agar and CHROMagar Orientation to isolate E. coli. A total of 325 E. coli isolates (15 from each herd) were tested for resistance to 17 veterinary antibiotics (CLSI and EUCAST guidelines) and enterotoxigenic (ETEC) genes (F4, F5, F6, F18, F41 and STa, STb, LT) commonly associated with piglet diarrhea. Phenotypic resistance to 3GC e.g. ceftiofur ( 8 lg/mL) was identifed in 5% (17/325). Of the 17 resistant isolates 14 lacked ETEC genes suggesting that 3GC resistance is circulating at higher pro-S134 Abstracts portions within non-pathogenic E. coli isolates at the farm level. Further analysis of 3GC resistance patterns in finisher pigs is essential, due to their relevance to potential zoonotic transmission. Genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV) was recently isolated from three patients with hepatitis in Cape Town, South Africa. As pigs are the reservoir of HEV genotype 3, prevalence of HEV was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 16 commercial pig herds supplying pork to Cape Town. A strain of HEV genotype 3e related to the human strains from Cape Town was identified in serum of one of the sampled pigs. A high HEV seroprevalence was found, with a median within-herd prevalence of 0.93. Preliminary analysis of factors on farms from which sampled pigs had originated identified several factors which were associated with HEV seropositivity at slaughter, including age-group mixing, increased contact between pigs and manure, inadequate pen resting times, and lack of general biosecurity measures. This is the first study to investigate the presence and epidemiology of HEV in South African pigs. The findings indicate that strategies to prevent cases of the disease can only be approached from a one-health perspective to include prevention of transmission between pigs, prevention of zoonotic spread to animal workers and pork consumers, and adequate control of farm and abattoir waste to prevent contamination of the environment. Dairy farming is regarded as one of the ways to satisfy the growing demand for high-quality animal protein worldwide. Growing intensification of dairy production systems has also lead to increased use of antibiotics and other chemicals. This negatively affects food quality and the environment, while AMR (Anti Microbial Resistance) is rapidly becoming one of the main challenges for human and animal health. Since 2014 Dutch Farm Experience is collaborating with international partners on improving milk quality and responsible use of antibiotics in dairy farming. Organized as the international",

            "text": "There are approximately 20 known species of mosquito-borne flaviviruses that circulate in the Asia-Pacific region, including a number of known pathogens. Normally most of these viruses exist in animal-mosquito transmission cycles. Over the past 20 years, a number of flaviviruses have emerged unexpectedly to cause outbreaks of human and/or animal disease. Japanese encephalitis emerged in northern Australia in 1995, causing human cases of disease; Zika virus emerged in the Western Pacific from SE Asia in 2007 as a significant human pathogen, and has since spread to several Pacific islands as well as to the Americas; and Murray Valley encephalitis re-emerged in south eastern Australia to cause human and equine disease, together with West Nile virus, which caused unprecedented numbers of equine disease. In each of these examples, a confluence of favourable vertebrate host reservoir and environmental factors occurred to allow these viruses to become established, including the presence of immunologically na\u00efve human and/or animal populations and competent vectors. These examples of flavivirus diseases and the factors underlying their emergence or re-emergence will be presented in the context of One Health, and their potential for pandemic spread will be explored.",

With the world population projected to reach over 9 billion by 2050 these issues will only heighten in the coming decades. The reduction of food loss and waste is one strategy that can assist in meeting these challenges. In 2011, 9,900 tonnes of edible offal produced in Australia were wasted and a further 19,600 tonnes of edible offal and 23,800 tonnes of mutton were used for purposes other than direct human consumption. Greater utilisation of sheep carcases and carcase parts for direct human consumption has the potential to benefit human health and the natural environment. This would be achieved through improving the micronutrient status of populations, in particular iron levels, and by increasing the yields of sheep producers, hence lowering greenhouse gas emission intensities and land clearance rates. This approach supports improved sheep health and greater gross margins in the sheep meat value chain. Quantifying and qualifying the loss of mutton and sheep offal from the human food chain, together with refining the communication pathways in the Australian sheep meat value chain, will contribute to sustainable and healthy domestic food systems.",

Recent disease outbreaks have raised the profile of bats within this paradigm. Wildlife Health Australia (WHA), the national peak body for wildlife health, is an example of One Health in action, coordinating a growing network of over 600 wildlife health professionals around Australia from a range of disciplines. WHA's Bat Health Focus Group is a successful illustration of this approach. Members include representatives from commonwealth and state/territory government agencies dealing with public health, agriculture and environment, university researchers, ecologists, virologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, wildlife/bat carers, cavers, and the Australasian Bat Society. Using a collaborative One Health approach, the group considers bat health issues in relation to the broader context of public health, biosecurity, livestock health, biodiversity and environmental impacts in Australia. Focus is on endemic zoonotic diseases such as Australian bat lyssavirus and Hendra virus, as well as preparedness for exotic diseases such as rabies and white-nose syndrome. Improved communication and collaboration across sectors allows for a more coordinated approach to investigation and management of wildlife health in Australia.",

Funding is primarily from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) through the Caring for Our Country (CFoC) program, with the understanding that, with other funding, WHA could also become more involved with biodiversity, human health and environmental issues. However, most of WHA's programs and activities function within a One Health space. This paper presents some of the activities that are working well and explains why. It discusses the future for wildlife health in Australia, opportunities for potential collaboration, and concludes that though much good work has been done, much is still to do and there is the need for sustained direction and focus.",
