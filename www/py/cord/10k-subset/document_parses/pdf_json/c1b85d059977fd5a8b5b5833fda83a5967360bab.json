All the patients with nvA(H1N1) virus infection presented symptoms of acute respiratory viral infection on admission. The median length of hospital stay was higher in the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group compared with the mild disease group (11 days vs. 6 days, P < 0.001). All patients with nvA(H1N1) virus infection received oseltamivir on admission: the standard dose (150 mg/day) was administered for patients with mild disease, and a higher dose (300 mg/day) was used for nvA(H1N1)-ARDS patients. During the ICU hospitalization, critical patients with influenza virus infection (ARDS) received corticosteroid therapy (hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone). In agreement with our protocol, empirical antibiotics were started on admission.",

Apoptosis of virus-infected cells was shown to be an effective mechanism for viral clearance [19] . Bermejo-Martin and colleagues reported more significant IL-12 results in the critical A(H1N1) group of patients [9] . In our study, IL-12 is significantly higher in the nvA (H1N1)-mild disease group and in the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group versus the control group and is not significantly higher in the bacterial ARDS group. IL-15 plays a critical role in protecting CD8 + T cells from apoptosis during the contraction phase following microbial infection [20, 21] . The CD8 + T cells surviving in the presence of IL-15 might be pathogenic in lung injury following highly pathogenic influenza A virus infection [22] .

In our study, IL-15 is significantly higher in the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group versus the nvA(H1N1)-mild disease group, but without significant difference in the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS versus bacterial-ARDS groups.

IL-15 is significantly higher at admission (P1) and 3 days later (P2) in the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group for nonsurvivors versus survivors, so it might be pathogenic in lung injury influenza A virus infection.

Despite the apparently beneficial role that macrophages play in controlling early viral replication, several reports have demonstrated a more deleterious effect of these cells in influenza A viral infections by excessive inflammation in the lung attributed to IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 [26] . In our study, IL-6 is increased in nvA(H1N1)-ARDS versus nvA(H1N1)-mild disease. Similarly, IL-6 and IL-15 constituted a hallmark of critical illness in the Hong Kong and Spanish nvA(H1N1) cytokine studies [8, 9] . In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, the IL-6 serum level is significantly higher at admission than 3 days later. In the same group, IL-6 is significantly higher in nonsurvivors versus survivors at admission and 3 days later, which seems to further contribute to pulmonary damage and death. We found positive correlations between IL-6, IL-15 and IL-8 levels and a longer than 5 days interval between symptom onset and admission, as well as with C-reactive protein, but a negative correlation with the PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio, indicating the severity of the disease. IL-8 is a chemokine of innate immunity. The chemokine's principal biologic effect is chemotaxis, being a major chemokine for neutrophil activation, and migration into tissues [24] . In our study, IL-8 is highly significant in the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS and ARDS bacterial groups versus the control group, but is not significant in mild disease. In contrast, IL-8 was increased in both critical and noncritical nvA(H1N1) hospitalized patients in the Spanish and Hong Kong studies. In our study, IL-8 is higher in nvA(H1N1)-ARDS versus nvA(H1N1)-mild disease and in bacterial ARDS versus nvA(H1N1)-ARDS. The obese patients with nvA(H1N1) disease had a significant level of IL-8.

In the nvA(H1N1)-ARDS group, the IP-10 level is higher at admission than 3 days after admission because of the survivors' cytokine profile. An increased level of IP-10 was found in the Spanish group as early response to nvA(H1N1) infection in both hospitalized and mild patient disease, as in the present study, while in the Hong Kong group IP-10 was significantly higher in critical patients only. In our study, IP-10 levels in nvA(H1N1)-ARDS nonsurvivors remained higher at admission and 3 days later, being not significantly correlated with the clinical outcome. Emphysema was one of our hystopathological findings and thus it might be speculated that a high level of IP-10 in nonsurvivors could be correlated with emphysema.
