To date, all licensed vaccines generate especially specific antibodies, which attach to the infectious agent and therefore can very largely prevent infection. These vaccines have been so effective in developed countries in preventing mortality after a subsequent infection that attempts are being made to develop vaccines against many of the remaining infectious agents. Many of the latter are difficult to manipulate; they can cause persisting infections or show great antigenic variation.

One approach, pioneered by Edward Jenner, is to use a virus that is a natural pathogen in another mammalian host as the basis of a vaccine in humans. Examples of this approach are the use of cowpox and parainfluenza viruses in humans, and the turkey human virus in chickens. More recently, the use of avipox viruses such as fowlpox and canarypox, which undergo an abortive infection in humans, is being used in humans as vectors of DNA coding for antigens of other infectious agents for which vaccines are not yet available (2). 2. The measles, mumps, rubella, and yellow fever vaccines are typical of the second approach. The wild-type viruses are extensively passaged in tissue culture/animal hosts until an acceptable balance is reached between loss of virulence and retention of immunogenicity in humans. 3. Type 2 polio virus is a naturally occurring attenuated strain that has been highly successful. More recently, rotavirus strains of low virulence have been recovered from children's nurseries during epidemics (3). 4 . A fourth approach has been to select mutants that will grow at low temperatures but very poorly above 37\u00b0C (4). The cold-adapted strains of influenza virus grow at 25\u00b0C and have mutations in four of the internal viral genes (5).

In general, it has proven more difficult to make highly effective attenuated bacterial vaccines, but with increasing examples of antibiotic resistance occurring, there is now a greater effort. A general approach is to selectively delete or inactivate one or more genes (7). Salmonella strain Ty21a has a faulty galactose metabolism, and strains with other deletions are being made.

In developing countries, the EPI schedule is to give the vaccine at 9 mo of age. This delay is meant to allow a sufficient drop in the level of maternally derived antibody so that the vaccine can take. In some infants, this decay occurs by 6 mo, resulting in many deaths from measles infection in the ensuing 2 to 3 mo, \"high-titer\" vaccines were therefore developed that could be given at 6 mo of age. Trials in several countries showed the apparent safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, but after WHO authorized its wider usage, some young girls in disadvantaged countries died, leading to the withdrawal of the vaccine (24). One possibility is that the high titer vaccine caused a degree of immunosuppression sufficient to allow infections by other infectious agents. Another example is the rotavirus vaccine that was registered for use in the United States in 1998. It was withdrawn in 1999 after administration to 1.5 million children because of an unacceptable level-about one case per 10,000 recipients in some areas-of the condition intussusception (25).

The CTLs are largely responsible for virus clearance and it has been thought that the subsequent decline in CTL activity that occurs shortly after infectious virus can no longer be recovered (50), and this is because of the short half-life of these cells. The two dominant cytokines are IL-12, which favors a Th-1 response (51), and IL-4, which favors a Th-2 response. The production of IL-4, which results in the enhancement of the antibody response, may curtail the life of the CTLs. The finding that if IL-4 is \"artificially\" induced very early after infection, CTL production is substantially suppressed (52), supports this notion. One important point is that a large pool of memory CTLs has already been formed by the time that CTL activity usually disappears.

Within the first 100 yr, the indigenous populations in these regions had decreased by at least 90%, due mainly to the introduced infections.
