This conclusion is based in part on the assumption that the chimpanzees used in these studies did not have latent viral infections that might have been reactivated by infusion of any of the experimental inocula. In fact, previous studies in our laboratory have shown that chimpanzees given an iv inoculation of noninfectious plasma from chimpanzees (up to 100 ml), homogenates of liver tissue from marmosets or chimpanzees, or suspensions of stool from chimpan-zees do not exhibit enzymatic or histologic evidence of nonspecific or spontaneous liver disease (authors' unpublished data).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The first episode of NANB hepatitis in chimpanzees 1030 and 1041 was induced by infection with a chloroform-resistant agent that was pelleted from a partially purified liver preparation in one instance and a chronic-phase plasma pool in the other. In animal 1030, the infectivity of a liver preparation from a chimpanzee with acute NANB hepatitis was demonstrated after an extensive purification procedure that was specifically designed to recover viruslike particles with properties similar to those of picornaviruses or small, unenveloped RNA viruses. Of interest is that the cytoplasmic vesiculation visualized in hepatocytes in some biopsy specimens obtained from animal 1030 during the first episode of NANB hepatitis was morphologically similar to that observed in cultured cells infected by mammalian picornaviruses [28] [29] [30] . This finding is consistent with our earlier-reported recovery of 27-nm viruslike particles from the factor VIII preparation and cesium chloride gradient fractions of the liver homogenate from chimpanzee 771 [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 828, "end": 832, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 833, "end": 837, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1050, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Challenge of animal 1030 with inoculum IV failed to induce biochemical, histologic, or electron microscopic evidence of NANB hepatitis.

Rechallenge of animal 1030 with inoculum II, however, caused a second episode of NANB hepatitis that was accompanied by the appearance of tubules, convoluted endoplasmic reticulum, and dense reticular inclusion bodies.

These arrays were sometimes associated with (or connected to) membranous structures (far left, x 52,300; middle, x 79,300; far right, x 40,(00).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Description of inocula used in NANB hepatitis infectivity studies in chimpanzees.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Inoculum\n</td><td>Source [reference(s)]\n</td><td>Method of preparation\n</td><td>Infectivity and ultrastructural changes in chimpanzees\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Proved-infectious factor VIII concentrate [3]\n</td><td>Diluted 1:1,000 in normal chimpanzee serum\n</td><td>Noninfectious (control): no ALT elevation or electron microscopic changes; normal liver histology\n</td></tr><tr><td>II\n</td><td>Chronic-phase plasma\n</td><td>Pelleted at 120,000 g for 5 hr; pellet resuspended in PBS\n</td><td>Induced NANB hepatitis: elevated\n</td></tr><tr><td>from chimpanzee 771, a proved NANB hepati-\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>ALT activity; cytoplasmic vesiculation in hepatocytes, with tubules and convoluted endoplasmic reticulum; abnormal liver histology\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>tis carrier [17, 18]\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>III\n</td><td>Proved-infectious acute- phase liver homogenate </td><td>Homogenate pelleted; pellet treated with 83070\n</td><td>Induced NANB hepatitis: elevated\n</td></tr><tr><td>CHCh and banded on CsCI gradient;\n</td><td>ALT activity; severely abnormal liver histology; cytoplasmic vesiculation and vacuolation in hepatocytes; no tubules or convoluted endoplasmic reticulum present\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>from chimpanzee 771 [3, 19] </td><td>gradient fractions of 1.30-1.36 g/cm! pooled, diluted, and pelleted; pellet resuspended in Tris-BSA\n</td></tr><tr><td>IV\n</td><td>Same as inoculum III\n</td><td>Same as for inoculum III except for omission of CHCb treatment\n</td><td>Noninfectious: no ALT elevation during 10 weeks of observation\n</td></tr><tr><td>V\n</td><td>Same as inoculum II\n</td><td>Same as for inoculum II, but resuspended pellet treated with 20070 CHCh\n</td><td>Induced NANB hepatitis: elevated ALT activity; cytoplasmic vesiculation in hepatocytes; no tubules or convoluted endoplasmic reticulum\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": []}
