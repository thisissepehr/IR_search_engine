The inclusion in the diet of IF from oat hulls, at levels between 2 to 3% improves the growth performance of broilers fed low-fiber diets and dietary inclusion of 3% inulin or cellulose (Arbocel FD00) as an IF source has been shown to reduce feed intake and improved egg production of broiler breeder hens from 43 to 55 wk of age (Mohiti-Asli et al., 2012 The potential benefits of fiber are dependent to a great extent on the physicochemical characteristics of the fiber source.

After 5 wk, when the pullets were 13 wk of age, six pullets (one per pen) were randomly selected from each treatment and killed with an intravenous overdose of pentobarbitone sodium (Lethabarb, Virbac Animal Health, Milperra, NSW, Australia). Within 5 min of the absence of a detectable palpebral reflex, the liver, gizzard, proventriculus, pancreas, small intestine and ceca were removed. The gizzard was cleaned of contents and both it and the liver weighed. Whole proventriculus and pancreas were rinsed with cold 0.9% saline, blotted dry, weighed and stored at -80 \u2022 C for later analysis of enzyme activities. The contents of the small intestines (jejunum and ileum) were washed out with 0.9% saline then the tract was divided into three equal lengths (proximal, medial and distal sections) and 1 cm segments from the middle of each section were collected, weighed separately and stored at -80 \u2022 C for later analysis of enzyme activities. The contents of the ceca were washed out with saline. At 5 wk the remaining 16 pullets in Group C were divided so that eight pullets continued on the control diet (Group C) and eight were given the IF diet (Group C-IF). Eight of the pullets from Group IF continued to be fed the IF diet (Group IF) and eight were given the control diet (Group IF-C). The pullets were housed in three pens per treatment with two pens of three and one of two pullets.

Addition of pea fiber, wheat bran and oat bran either at low (18 g/kg) or high levels (375 g/kg) in broiler diets was shown by J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1996) to cause a significant increase in the weight of the GIT tract which is similar to the results of Experiment 1 in pullets given the IF diet for 10 wk. The effects of IF on gizzard and proventricular weights shown here are similar to those in an experiment by Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al. (2007) , in which IF was included in the diets of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 d of age: the IF was included either as 3% oat hulls or 3% soy hulls, in low-fiber diets (crude fiber 2.5%). Oat hulls caused a significant increase in gizzard weight: proventricular weight was only significantly increased with soy hulls (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al., 2007) . Thus source of IF (and therefore proportions of the different fiber components) can influence organ development differently. Similar to the experiment reported here using Arbocel RC, Bogus lawska-Tryk (2005) also reported no effect of the IF source, Arbocel BWW-40, on pancreas weight. Adding IF to poultry feeds has been shown to change the weight and length of the GIT (Siri, 1992; Viveros et al., 1994; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1996; Smits et al., 1997) which supports the results obtained in Experiment 1. Taylor and Jones (2004) suggested that increased gizzard size could be a reason for the reduction in weight of the small intestine they found and may reflect an adaptation of the gut to increased availability of nutrients as a result of feeding a diet containing increased fiber concentration. A welldeveloped gizzard can positively enhance digestion as food is retained for a longer time in the upper digestive tract (proventriculus and gizzard) and this may activate digestive secretions from specific organs and result in more efficient nutrient assimilation (Jones and Taylor, 2001) . Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al. (2007) showed that fiber improved total tract apparent retention of feed and feed conversion and it also caused a decrease in the pH in the gizzard. Fewer experiments using IF have been carried out on layer-strain poultry than broilers; however, Freitas et al.
