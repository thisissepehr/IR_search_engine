Their physiological properties and health benefits depend on the site, rate and extent of their digestion or fermentation in the human gastrointestinal tract. The polysaccharide fraction of plant cell walls (dietary fibre) and some forms of starch (resistant starch) are resistant to hydrolysis in the small intestine. These carbohydrate polymers as well as indigestible oligosaccharides, e.g. stacchyose and raffinose, enter the colon through the ileocaecal valve to be fermented by the colonic bacterial flora. Monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars are absorbed as they pass through the healthy small intestine and only become available to the colonic flora as a consequence of deficiencies in the transport system, or, more usually, specific disaccharidase deficiencies, e.g. lactase deficiency. Physiological carbohydrate malabsorption, that is, the fermentable carbohydrate entering the colon in healthy individuals, is in the range of 30-60 g/day in Western communities .l!l This load is normally fermented by the vast numbers of colonic bacteria.",

The review deals almost exclusively with lactulose.
