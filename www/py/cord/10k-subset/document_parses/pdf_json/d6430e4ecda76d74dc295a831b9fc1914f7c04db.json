If the HTSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 and 2 susceptible patients would increase 118.4% (standard deviation (SD): 33.0%) and 115.4% (SD: 30.5%) respectively. The communal surfaces (CSs) had the least impact, if CSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 susceptible patient would only increase 1.7% (SD: 1.3). The impact of clinical equipment (CE) differed largely for two types of susceptible patients.

We considered that the ICU was staffed by three daytime and three nighttime nurses, each dedicated to a pair of beds, and one physician. Without loss of generality, it was assumed patient 1 is colonized with MRSA, and all other people are susceptible to MRSA colonization or infection ( Fig. 1) . We classified the numerous surfaces in the ICU into three groups: communal surfaces, clinical equipment and surfaces near patients. Communal surfaces (CSs) are those touched by all patients and/or HCWs in the ICU, including: room dividers (curtains), door handles, etc. Clinical equipment (CE) are those items typically touched only by the HCWs. Near-patient surfaces (NPSs) are typically touched only by each patient and the HCWs that care for that patient, and include: the bedrail, bed surfaces and overbed table, etc. The NPSs were subdivided based on the rate of contacts by HCWs reported by Huslage et al. [6] into HTSs, medium-touch surfaces (MTSs) and low-touch surfaces (LTSs). As a result, for each patient, there were three kinds of NPSs (HTSs, MTSs, and LTSs). In total, 20 environmental surface compartments were included in the model: 1 CSs, 1 CE, 6 HTSs, 6 MTSs and 6 LTSs. Since our primary interest is the contribution of each type of surface to MRSA transmission, we did not further subdivide the five surface types. The assumed touched area of CSs, CE, and near-patient HTSs, MTSs and LTSs are 2000, 3000, 2100, 1800, 2600 cm 2 respectively (Additional file 1: Part B, Table B .1). Since these values are relatively similar, we assumed each surface type had a 2300 cm 2 area, the average of the areas of the five surface types. Each of the 13 individuals in the 6-bed ICU were represented in the model by two compartments: the hands and the exposure sitethe nares, which is a site frequently colonized by MRSA. In total, the model included 46 compartments representing places where MRSA might be.",

Nurses and the physician spent about 30% of their work shifts in direct patient care, and we assumed nurses and the physician visited patients 4 times and 1 time per work shift respectively [23, 24] . Thus, each nurse spent 27 min with each patient per visit (0.3 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 60/(2 \u00d7 4) = 27 min) and the physician spent 27 min with each patient per visit (0.3 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 60/6 = 27 min), which is close to the time estimated by Temime et al.

For nurses, since each nurse visits each patient 4 times per work shift, it is assumed that the nurse visits patients once per 3 h and visits the two patients in the first 54 min (0.9 h) of the 3-h period, without considering the order of the visits, and spends the remaining time at the nurses' station. For the physician, it was assumed that he/she visits 6 patients consecutively, starting at 9:00, spending 27 min with each patient, also without considering the visit order. For the remainder of the work shift, the physician is not present in the ICU.",

We assumed HCWs would clean their hands after 42% of healthcare visits with patients, which is the average hand hygiene compliance rate observed in 12 studies conducted in ICUs (Additional file 1: Part A.

In order to represent the discrete nurse hand hygiene process in the continuous governing ODEs, the following translation is made. After each hand hygiene, only a fraction (1-90%) of MRSA remains on hands. Hand hygiene occurs 1.8 time per hour, and the time-average rate of pathogen removal due to hand hygiene is denoted by \u03b1 h (/h). Then on average, there is 1-90% = e \u2212\u03b1 h =1:8 and \u03b1 h = \u2212log(1-90%)*1.8 = 4.1/h. It was assumed that patients do not wash their hands during the simulation time.",

As we can see from the above results, the mean MRSA concentration on the nares of susceptible patients is stable between after days 3, so the MRSA concentration dynamics in the third day was used for analysis. Figure 2 shows the temporal change of the mean MRSA concentrations on hands of HCWs and environmental surfaces during the third and fourth day after admission of the colonized index patient to the ICU. The MRSA concentration on HCWs' hands increases during visits with patients, but decreases rapidly due to hand hygiene and relatively high inactivation rate of MRSA on hands (0.57 /h). Though the MRSA concentrations on environmental surfaces increased slowly compared with that on hands, MRSA will accumulate to a high level if surface cleaning is not performed, due to the relatively low rate of MRSA on environmental surfaces (0.0082 The MRSA concentrations on surfaces near patient 2 is about 10-times greater than the concentrations on surfaces near patient 3. This is mainly because patient 2 is closer to the index patient than patient 3 in the contact network. That is, MRSA transmission to surfaces near patient 2 requires only two steps: 1) from the index patient (patient 1) to a nurse's hands (nurse 7 or 8 in Fig. 1) , and 2) from the nurse's hands to surfaces near patient 2. Transmission to surfaces near patient 3 requires four steps: 1) from the index patient (patient 1) to a nurse's hands (nurse 7 and/or 8), 2) from the nurse's hands to CSs and/or CE, 3) from contaminated CSs and/ or CE to a nurse's hands (nurse 9 and/ or 10), and 4) from the nurse's hands to surfaces near patient 3. The transfer efficiencies of the two additional steps were 0.23 and 0.28, so the MRSA concentration on surfaces near patient 3 would be about 6.5% (0.23 \u00d7 0.28 = 0.065) of the concentration on surfaces near patient 2. Of course, the steps for MRSA transmission from patient 1 to patients 2 and 3 via the physician are the same, so the ratio of MRSA concentrations on surfaces near patient 2 and patient 3 would be a little higher than 6.5%.",

In this study, we showed that MRSA concentrations on surfaces near MRSA-susceptible patients were positively associated with the frequency of hand contacts, partly due to that our model was a linear ODEs model. This trend was also observed in a field study in a 10-bed adult ICU, in which the bioburden on five nearpatient surfaces was linearly associated with the frequency of hand contacts [21] . Theoretical work in network modeling has also shown that disease spread more easily among highly connected individuals [33] . According to the modeling study, the absolute MRSA concentration on the nares of susceptible patients was low, particularly compared to the index patient, this is because it was assumed that the MRSA on each compartment is uniformly distributed in the model.

Failure to clean HTSs near the patients on a daily basis was estimated to increase the MRSA transmitted to susceptible patients by approximately 120%. Similarly, in an office building, daily disinfection of highly-touched surfaces had the greatest impact on controlling the MS2 phage concentration on workers' hands, yielding an average reduction in phase concentrations of 41.7% [34] , which means that noncompliance of daily disinfection of high-touch surface would lead to an 140% ([1-41.7%]/41.7% = 140%) increase of phage transmitted to workers. It is already known that traditional communal surfaces such as toilets, floor and sinks tend to attract high rates of cleaning [35] , while near-patient hand-touch sites such as bed rail, overbed table and bedside table, are not always well cleaned [36, 37] . The responsibility for cleaning nearpatient hand-touch sites has been found to fall to nurses, who are typically very busy and may be unable to perform this task consistently [38] . Two studies in ICUs have demonstrated an increased risk of HAIs following periods of inadequate nurse staffing [39, 40] .",

In addition, this study also did not consider other source of pathogens, such as mobile contamination by healthcare workers. Second, in determining the pathogen transfer efficiency from one type of surface to hand and the reverse direction, the surfaces are all thought to be non-porous surfaces. This is due to most surfaces in UIC are non-porous surfaces. However, there still are some porous surfaces in hospital, such as bed surfaces and clothes. The relative low pathogen transfer efficiency from porous surface to hand and relative high pathogen transfer efficiency from hand to porous surface may lead much pathogen harbour on the bed surfaces, then the cleaning of HTSs (bed surface is one HTS in our model) in reality may be more important than we obtained in this study. Finally, the ODEs model we used in this study could provide a good approximation of the average behaviors in large scale settings, but may not be applicable in all situations.",

The findings of this study contribute to the development of targeted surface cleaning strategies. The model and associated approaches could also be applied to other pathogens in indoor environments.",
