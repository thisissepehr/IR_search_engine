We retrospectively reviewed patient records in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of pediatric cardiovascular operations between March 2015 and March 2018. We selected five days of continuous post-operative data just after termination of muscle relaxants. Midazolam sedation was estimated by Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. We enrolled 104 patients (average age 26 weeks) of which 16 (15%) had DS. DS patients had a high probability of receiving a higher midazolam dosage and dexmedetomidine dosage over the study period (probability = 0.99, probability = 0.97) while depth of sedation was not different in DS patients (probability = 0.35). Multi regression modeling included severity scores and demographic data showed DS decreases midazolam sedation compared with controls (posterior OR = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.01-1.75).

Patients with DS frequently have associated developmental disorders and about 40% of children with DS are born with congenital heart disease (CHD) 5 , leading to higher mortality rates. Although many of these malformations can be surgically corrected, DS patients face additional risks such as airway obstruction while under sedation 6 . Recently, pharmacological interactions of dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly selective\u03b12-adrenergic agonist, with DS patients were shown to result in more side effects 7 . Additionally, benzodiazepine (BDZ), which increases GABA A receptor-mediated chloride ion influx, is thought to engender pharmaco-resistance in DS patients due to altered GABAergic transmission in area CA1 8 as seen in murine models.

The outcome of interest was sedation status measured by SBS and the dependent factor was MDZ dosage. However, muscle relaxants are ordinarily used after cardiac operations to avoid negative hemodynamic effects and this may mask both sedation status and pharmaco-resistance to sedatives. However, excluding muscle relaxant usage days would cause lead time bias and possible overestimation of the outcome 19, 20 . Thus, we used muscle relaxant days as a covariate for the multi-regression modeling to mediate the bias in addition to a five-day post-usage period in our analysis. For adjustment of our model, additional covariates were chosen a priori: sex, age, RACHS-1, dose of dexmedetomidine, vecuronium dosage status (received/ not received) and PELOD-2 (without the central nervous system component). To adjust patient demographic characteristics, we chose sex and age as covariates. RACHS-1 was used to adjust operation severity and PELOD-2 (without the central nervous system component) was used to adjust post-surgical daily severity.

Although some studies showed no differences in mortality between DS and normal pediatric patients, it is in the recovery stage that DS complications arise 29, 30 . Recovery from heart surgery is difficult even in adult patients and for pediatric cases complicated by DS, recovery troubles are compounded by various developmental deficits 7 . A retrospective study by Nasser and colleagues found that almost 12% of DS patients recovering from heart surgery needed prolonged mechanical ventilation and almost half of these patients required medication for resultant hypertension 31 . Hematological abnormalities can also be present, complicating wound healing 32, 33 . Adding to this complex issue is the amount of sedative needed to prevent unnecessary suffering and anxiety during the healing process. In DS patients, there is clinical evidence that trisomy disorders increase the need for MDZ and similar drugs due to alterations in the GABAergic transmission system 10, 34 . On the translational side, many fundamental studies showed altered GABAergic transmission in murine models that mimic the brain morphology of DS 34 and indicated that GABA A receptor-mediated synaptic transmission occurs in the hippocampus 35 .The propensity of DS patients to more frequently suffer from epilepsy (mediated in the hippocampus), along with dysregulated GABA excitatory-inhibitory balance is hypothesized to be one of the main reasons for the reduced effect of BDZ 36 . With this hypothesis in mind, we sought to establish a more solid link between DS and BDZ-class anesthesia midazolam requirements by a retrospective, single-center analysis. Although we did not do genetic screens, we did have validated sedation and risk scales (SBS and PELOD-2) to base our measurements on. We compensated for fluctuations in recovery inherent to cardiovascular surgery by using Bayesian inference for GLMM. We found that, in general, DS patients required more BDZ over longer periods than normal patients and that daily cumulative doses of dexmedetomidine were increased to compensate for the lessened effect of MDZ. Although we did not observe any prevalence of sedation-related syndromes such as withdrawal and delirium over our study period, a longer duration, multi-centered study saw a prevalence of withdrawal syndrome of more than 60% after mechanical ventilation and sedative administration of more than 5 days 37 . As DS patients have more complex recoveries than normal, it is entirely possible that any recovery lengthened by DS complications will require more sedatives that, in turn, will increase withdrawal symptoms after prolonged usage. Furthermore, a recent study showed that MDZ usage is a risk factor for developing pediatric delirium 38 . Taken together, these results pair well with our results and indicate that a new approach to sedation in DS patients is required. Unpredictable, variable and serious complications in respiration, clotting, drug metabolism, and slower healing after surgery require longer recoveries and more sedation to compensate for this. Additionally, as DS patients may suffer from withdrawal symptoms after extended use of sedatives such as BDZ, this could introduce additional suffering to patients already weakened from invasive surgery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 222, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 223, "end": 225, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 641, "end": 643, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 722, "end": 725, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 726, "end": 728, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1035, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1038, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1283, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1523, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2801, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To conclude, we conducted a retrospective study based on validated evaluative tools that indicated a need for higher doses of MDZ with higher doses of compensating sedatives for the 5-day period immediately after muscle relaxant usage following pediatric heart surgery.
