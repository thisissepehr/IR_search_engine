Superannuation is assessed as both adequate and sustainable, rents for state houses are found to be affordable, and GDP growth and employment have increased incrementally as unemployment and benefit numbers have decreased. The Primary Health Care Strategy is an innovative initiative that will increase affordable access to general practitioners, but it and the proposed child assistance initiatives are too new to be adequately assessed. Of the challenges that remain, policy priorities should centre on housing alternatives, including home ownership for low-income households not in state houses; income support for poor households, particularly those with children; and multi-sector development of education and training aimed at lifting economic and social capacity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In 1991 New Zealand's Finance Minister, Ruth Richardson, announced a Budget that she signalled \"the Mother of All Budgets\" (Louisson 1991) , featuring benefit cuts, market rents on state houses and the introduction of a range of new user charges.

Even when there is broad agreement on a high-level definition there remains considerable debate over how best to measure poverty. One of the main reasons for the lack of consensus is the need for judgements to be made as to what constitutes a minimum adequate income or standard of living. 2 As neither the income nor the living standards data can tell the researcher or analyst where to \"draw the line\", some external way to assess adequacy is needed. The NZPMP's measure of poverty is income based, but in contrast to approaches that simply set a poverty line at an arbitrary fraction of the mean or median household income, the NZPMP has sought to address the issue of assessing adequacy in an explicit and transparent way. The approach involves the use of focus groups to draw on the knowledge and practical experience of low-income householders (i.e. on their judgement) to estimate minimum adequate household expenditure in a full range of household expenditure categories.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poverty Measurement during the 1990s"}, {"text": "Following the introduction of the 1991 benefit cuts, the NZPMP began a comprehensive research programme into poverty measurement.

The total weekly household estimate is intended to be minimal, but sufficient to live on independently -without having to resort to a food bank or Special Benefit.

The structure of poverty changed, with increasing numbers of Housing NZ, private rental and mortgagor households, while reducing the number of freehold owners, many of whom were elderly. The poverty gap more than quadrupled for state house tenants and trebled for private renters. To verify that these income-based poverty measures were likely to lead to poor living standards, a range of other quantitative and qualitative data was collected through a series of studies involving survey methods, focus groups and in-depth interviews over the decade. These studies identified serious problems of affordability and a lack of access to key services. As the quantitative data showed, housing costs often squeezed out other necessary costs, like adequate food, clothing and healthcare. The focus group work generated information concerning people's coping strategies, budgetary choices, and affordable and unaffordable items and services. The results of a national random survey of households below the poverty threshold carried out by the NZPMP typifies the data that were collected, identifying specific problems and shortfalls in the areas of housing, food and health (Waldegrave et al. 1999) .

The order of policy change is certainly debatable. The Government argues that many lowincome families have been helped directly by the income-related rents policy, the active labour market policies and the public health strategy. Furthermore, they say most younger families still have the opportunity to improve their situation, whereas most of the elderly have completed their working years and do not have that possibility. The opposing argument states that although income for the elderly had started to deteriorate, it was still well above that for poor families and it would have been wiser to begin with them. Prioritising the needs of one group over another is always very difficult. From the perspective of these authors, the overall balance of policy mix is very important and that is addressed in the five policies highlighted in this paper. Unfortunately some have to take priority, and arresting the fall in the value of superannuation restored the only government social assistance payment that was previously above the poverty line.
