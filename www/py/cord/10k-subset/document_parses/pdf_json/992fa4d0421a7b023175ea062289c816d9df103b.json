A. P. Simons (Epsom) opened the discussion and congratulated Dr. Scott on his review of the equine viruses. The urgency of a better knowledge of virus diseases had been underlined a t the recent International Conference in Paris. He asked Dr. Scott if viruses were associated with labial and oral lesions and with grease and mud fever, and he described a case of papular dermatitis in a 2-year-old Thoroughbred and wondered if this might be a viral condition. Mr. Simons said that since many viruses known to infect horses did not occur normally in the British Isles veterinary sanitary regulations were of the first importance and proper inspection by trained eyes was necessary. Air transport was, of course, the hazard. Was the use of insecticidal sprays of any value? On another aspect of epidemic control what proportion of a susceptible population was it necessary to vaccinate to halt the spread of infection? What veterinary laboratories were currently investigating virus diseases?Dr. G. R. Scott replied that papular dermatitis was a contagion of probably world-wide distribution. The value of insecticidal spraying to limit the spread of arbo-viruses was considerably aided by the inability of most arbo-viruses to flourish for any length of time outside their endemic home area. On control by vaccination it was generally accepted that vaccination of 70 per cent of a population was adequate to abort a n epidemic.On the other hand there was a recent hypothesis that vaccination of only 10 per cent was adequate to prevent measles spreading. Current work on equine viruses was being carried out by Robert Burrows at Pirbright, influenza was under study at Cambridge and pox infections were under investigation at Liverpool.Dr. J. R. Campbell (Glasgow) asked for how long prophylactic treatment should be given to prevent outbreaks of virus infection.Dr. Scott replied that drugs might well be used in a closed community where animals could be segregated and movement stopped. Drugs could be used prophylactically over a short period for a non-persistent virus. Persistent viruses should be dealt with by infecting horses with live attenuated virus vaccines before they were required to hunt or race. G. N. Sutherland (York) enquired if an alteration of serotype would affect the value of this year's 'flu vaccine.Dr. Scott agreed that it would and added that infection in an immunised animal was a good way to produce a new serotype.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1, "end": 24, "text": "M.
