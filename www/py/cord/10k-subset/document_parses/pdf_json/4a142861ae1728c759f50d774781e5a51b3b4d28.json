Type A influenza viruses show two patterns of global spread. The first pattern describes the spread of strains representing major antigenic shifts; for example, in the cases of H 1N 1 virus in 1977 and H3N2 virus in 1968, the virus first appeared in the Far East and within 6-9 months had spread to all corners ofthe globe. The second pattern describes the spread of strains representing significant antigenic drift; for instance, the new strain A/Beijing/353/89 appeared first in China, remained in that country for about 6 months, was found about a year later in the Southern Hemisphere, and in the following winter reappeared in the Northern Hemisphere. As part of this pattern, widespread activity is often introduced by a \"herald wave,\" that is, the appearance of a new strain for a few weeks at the end ofone respiratory season followed by extensive epidemic spread in the next [4] . Because such epidemic behavior is common and consistent, it appears likely that these strains somehow remain hidden in the population over the summer months rather than being carried to colder climates and then returning with travelers during the next respiratory season.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 974, "end": 977, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza Virus"}, {"text": "The evolution of influenza viruses is by no means as simple and predictable as was previously thought. To begin with, the epidemiological behavior of both A/Swine influenza strains since 1976 and A/H 1N I strains since 1977 has disproven beyond doubt the previously held dogma that an antigenically \"new\" strain inevitably causes a pandemic or, at the very least, displaces existing strains. Detailed analysis of A/H 1N 1 and B strains has further indicated that the evolution of influenza viruses is complex and nonlinear. For example, the A/H 1N 1 virus that appeared in 1977 was genetically almost identical to virus circulating in 1950. (This similarity is the basis for the suspicion, never proven, that the virus emerged from some research worker's freezer in China in 1977.) The evolution of the virus during the years after each of those two dates has been studied by RNA sequence analysis [5] , and the evolutionary changes from 1950 to 1957 have turned out to be completely different from those occurring from 1977 to 1983 (figure 1). These changes also occurred more slowly during the latter period; this difference was attributed to the fact that the virus was subject to less antigenic \"pressure\" during this period, although this theory has not been proven.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 898, "end": 901, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza Virus"}, {"text": "Further evidence of complex evolution is that, in 1978-1979, viruses appeared that were proven by genetic analysis to be reassortants of H3N2 and HI N 1 viruses, containing four RNA segments from each parent and bearing the HI N 1 phenotype on the surface. These viruses circulated for only a few years and then disappeared, being survived by pure HI N 1 viruses. Similar reassortants between HI N 1 and H3N2 influenza A strains have emerged on other occasions. Additional studies have shown that neither A nor B strains of influenza virus necessarily evolve along a single path. There is clear evidence of branching and therefore of cocirculation of evolutionarily different strains of both influenza A/H 1N 1 virus [6] and influenza B virus [7] . A recent example related to the latter virus was the coexistence in Europe during 1990 of influenza viruses B/Yamashita/88 and B/Finland/90; these two viruses had evolved separately from a common parent dating back to 1983 [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 717, "end": 720, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 743, "end": 746, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 972, "end": 975, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza Virus"}, {"text": "It appears paradoxical that, on the one hand, influenza viruses are genetically unstable and constantly mutating and evolving, while, on the other, \"evolutionarily successful\" strains can travel throughout the world undergoing no-or, at most, a very few-changes in the base sequence ofthe HA gene.

First, reinfection is very common, even with strains that are antigenically closely related or identical. Second, infection takes place even in the presence of maternal antibody, although high titers clearly can modify infection or even prevent it entirely. Third, it seems likely from existing data that the mode of spread is through fomites or large-particle aerosols [8] , probably resembling that of rhinoviruses [9] rather than that of influenza virus, which can be transmitted by droplet nuclei [10] . These characteristics may translate into slower spread of RSV than of influenza virus (which can cause explosive epidemics under the right circumstances) and into a pattern of genetic evolution that is less governed by the need for antigenic change in order to escape from immunity in the population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 547, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 675, "end": 679, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza Virus"}, {"text": "The antigenic variability of RSV has now been well The two main branches are drawn to different scales and derive from the common precursor X o .

The two antigenic subgroups, A and B, differ primarily in the surface glycoprotein responsible for attachment (the G protein). Although the amino acid sequences of the G proteins of members of these two subgroups are very different (only 53% identical) and although these proteins are recognized as very different antigenically by the immune systems of both humans and rodents [11, 12] , neutralizing antibody after primary infection in infants \"sees\" the two strains as 31%related [12] . The antigenic diversity of the two RSV subgroups probably has some influence on the susceptibility of infants to sequential RSV infection [13] ; reinfection by members of the opposite subgroup is more likely than homologous reinfection. On the other hand, this effect of antigenic diversity probably does not last beyond the first reinfection, and repeated infections with either subgroup can and do occur throughout life [14] . Thus, in contrast to what has been observed for influenza virus, the influence of immunity on the larger epidemiology of RSV and on the circulation of strains of subgroups A and B may not be strong; temporary immunity in large populations may be responsible for the sometimes-acute nature of seasonal epidemics of RSV infection, with spread through a community and apparent \"exhaustion of susceptibles.\" In addition, in some countries (Finland being the best example), there have recently been discernible patterns of epidemics that alternate between the A and B subgroups, with 2-year cycles [IS]. As first described by Carlsen et al. in Norway [16] , RSV has appeared in double-humped outbreaks, the first hump of the cycle representing a smaller outbreak in the late spring (of 1981, 1983, 1985, etc.) and the second hump representing a larger outbreak beginning in the autumn of that same year and extending through February or March of the next year (1982, 1984, 1986, etc.) .

In anyone outbreak in anyone location, if a sufficiently large number of strains are analyzed (i.e., more than 75), both A and B strains are found; this observation suggests the type of cocirculation of antigenically different strains that has been observed for influenza virus in recent years [15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Moreover, although there is a tendency for the number of predominantly subgroup A outbreaks to exceed the number of predominantly subgroup B outbreaks, the sequence ofsubgroup predominance in anyone area (except Finland) is apparently random (table I) . No Scandinavian countries other than Finland have been studied in this regard. The epidemiological behavior ofRSV subgroups suggests that, at least outside Scandinavia, immunologic forces exert somewhat less control over seasonal patterns than is the case with influenza virus. The most detailed genetic analysis of RSV to date is that by Storch and colleagues [24] using RNA fingerprinting by base-pair mismatch and RNase protection. These interesting studies have shown widespread variation of the G protein gene among strains obtained from a single outbreak in a single geographic area. On the other hand, strains that are clearly epidemiologically related (for example, isolated from members of a family or from patients in a small nosocomial outbreak) have identical G protein genes. Moreover, identity has been described in a few instances among strains that apparently are not epidemiologically related, either in time or in space.

Two recent studies have suggested that virus in the middle ear may complicate the response to antibiotics and account for apparent failures of treatment [51, 52] .

When viruses have been studied, they have been detected in an average of 23% of children, whereas bacteria have been isolated from lung aspirates from an average of 63% of children with previously untreated cases [56] . The organisms most commonly isolated from lung aspirates have been the same as those isolated from the middle ear-namely, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (both typable and nontypable strains); the occasional isolates of other bacteria have in-eluded Staphylococcus aureus. gram-negative enteric bacilli, and Moraxella catarrhalis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 503, "end": 507, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 663, "end": 667, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 668, "end": 671, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1040, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1060, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1280, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral-Bacterial Interactions"}, {"text": "Clearly, lung aspiration must be reserved for special circumstances.

However, recent studies using more indirect measures of bacterial infection have raised important questions concerning the possible prominence of bacterial infection in pneumonia among children with less severe disease and among children of Europe and North America. These investigations have used a combination of antigen detection in respiratory secretions, serum, and/or urine and measurement of antibody conversion in serum.

Because S. pneumoniae was frequently cultured from the lungs or the blood in this unusual population, this study probably represents one of the best opportunities thus far for the validation of some of the recently developed indirect tests for pneumococcal infection in childhood pneumonia.
