            "text": "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether TIPE2 participates in the protective actions of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in a mouse model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Control mice were infected with an adeno-associated virus expressing no transgene. Three weeks later, an animal model of caecal ligation-perforation (CLP)-induced sepsis was established. DEX was administered intravenously 30 min after CLP. Twenty-four hours after sepsis, lung injury was assayed by lung histology, the ratio of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to total cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, BALF protein content and the lung wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio. Proinflammatory factor levels in the BALF of mice were measured. The protein expression levels in lung tissues were analysed by Western blotting. The results showed that DEX treatment markedly mitigated sepsis-induced lung injury, which was characterized by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio and total protein levels in the BALF. Moreover, DEX markedly attenuated sepsis-induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of PMNs in the BALF, lung MPO activity and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF. In addition, DEX dramatically prevented sepsis-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice, as reflected by decreases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells, the protein expression of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase 3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, evaluation of protein expression showed that DEX blocked sepsis-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Similar results were also observed in the TIPE2 overexpression group. Our study demonstrated that DEX inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis in a murine model of sepsis-stimulated ALI via the upregulation of TIPE2 and the suppression of the activation of the NF-\u03baB and JNK signalling pathways.",

Shamoperated control animals underwent the same procedure except for ligation and puncture of the cecum. Immediately after the surgery, the mice were intraperitoneally injected Dex (50 \u03bcg/kg) or the same volume (200 \u03bcl) of vehicles PBS. After that, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 ml of sterile saline for resuscitation and put into an incubator until they recovered from the anaesthesia [19, 20] .",

The effect of TIPE2 on the NF-\u03baB and JNK pathways was assessed in mice after CLP challenge. To evaluate the effect of TIPE2 overexpression on lung cell apoptosis in CLP-challenged mice, the protein expression levels of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and proapoptotic (Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9) protein in lung tissues were analysed by Western blotting. Mice with CLP-induced ALI exhibited decreased Bcl-2 protein expression and increased Bax, Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 protein expression in lung tissue samples compared to that in the sham group, whereas the expression changes in the proteins were reversed by AAV-TIPE2 and DEX treatment. In addition, CLP surgery markedly increased the phosphorylation of JNK (p-JNK) and nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 and decreased TIPE2 expression in the lungs compared with those in the sham group. However, AAV-TIPE2 and DEX treatment suppressed the increase in the expression of nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 and p-JNK induced by LPS. Moreover, the combination group exhibited lower expression of Bax, cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9, p-JNK and nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 but higher levels of Bcl-2 and TIPE2, compared with those in the AAV-TIPE2 + CLP and CLP + DEX groups (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6) .",

Our study showed that AAV-TIPE2 and DEX attenuated the histopathological damage of ALI, including edema, haemorrhage, alveolar wall thickness and PMN recruitment into the lungs of mice after CLP. In ALI, neutrophils significantly contribute to the progression of the host's inflammatory defence [34, 35] . Neutrophils migrate into the pulmonary alveoli and release proinflammatory cytokines, subsequently damaging pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells [36, 37] . When neutrophils are activated, MPO, which is highly expressed in neutrophils and haemoglobin, can be released into phagosomes and the extracellular matrix. Consequently, the immune activity of MPO may reflect the degree of vascular injury and neutrophil infiltration [38] . The results of our present study showed that the number of PMNs and MPO activity were lower in the AAV-TIPE2 + CLP and CLP + DEX groups than in the CLP group, and the number of PMNs and MPO activity in the combination treatment group were lowest.

            "text": "ill patients [43, 44] . Caspase-3 plays a key role in apoptotic cell death [45] , and our present study revealed a significant increase in the level of cleaved caspase-3 after CLP surgery, indicating increased cell apoptosis in the lungs. MAPK family molecules are important regulators involved in the production of cytokines and mediators associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes [46] . JNK, a member of the MAPK family, has been implicated in many cellular events, including apoptosis [47] . A variety of stress signals, such as cytokines and inflammation, can trigger JNK phosphorylation, which subsequently mediates the phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL) and upregulates pro-apoptotic Bax [48] . When the Bax to Bcl-2 ratio elevates, the mitochondrial membrane potential changes, causing the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol [49] , resulting in the activation of caspase 9 and then caspase 3 to induce apoptosis [50] . In the current study, we found that AAV-TIPE2 and DEX remarkably inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and JNK phosphorylation induced by CLP and restored the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of TIPE2 overexpression and DEX on CLP-induced cell apoptosis may be attributed to the suppression of JNK activation. Moreover, Western blotting results revealed that the TIPE2 protein expression level was significantly decreased after CLP challenge; however, DEX treatment increased the TIPE2 level compared with that in the CLP group.",

We have also provided evidence that the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of DEX might at least partly involve the upregulation of TIPE2 and the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB and JNK signalling pathways. Therefore, our results indicate that DEX might be useful as a potential therapeutic target for sepsis-induced ALI.",
