However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions. Methods: Whole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia). The assemblies were used to characterize sequences in each strain relative to the reference 3D7 (a clone of NF54) genome.

Several variations of a highly promising pre-erythrocytic, whole organism malaria vaccine based on P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) are under development, all based on the same P. falciparum strain, NF54 [2] , thought to be of West African origin, and which use different mechanisms for attenuation of PfSPZ.

However, depending on the immunization regimen, sterile protection can be significantly lower (8-83%) against heterologous CHMI using the 7G8 Brazilian clone [7, 8] , and against infection in malaria-endemic regions with intense seasonal malaria transmission (29% and 52% by proportional and time to event analysis, respectively) [9] . Heterologous CHMI in chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites trials, in which immunization is by infected mosquito bite of individuals undergoing malaria chemoprophylaxis, have been conducted with NF135.C10 from Cambodia [13] and NF166.C8 from Guinea [14] , and have had lower efficacy than against homologous CHMI [15, 16] . One explanation for the lower efficacy seen against heterologous P. falciparum strains is the extensive genetic diversity in this parasite species, which is particularly high in genes encoding antigens [17] and which combined with low vaccine efficacy against non-vaccine alleles [18] [19] [20] reduces overall protective efficacy and complicates the design of broadly efficacious vaccines [21, 22] . The lack of a detailed genomic characterization of the P. falciparum strains used in CHMI studies and the unknown genetic basis of the parasite targets of PfSPZ vaccine-and PfSPZ CVac-induced protection have precluded a conclusive statement regarding the cause(s) of variable vaccine efficacy outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 149, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 260, "end": 263, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 277, "end": 280, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 456, "end": 459, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 460, "end": 462, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 628, "end": 631, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 849, "end": 853, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 943, "end": 947, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 948, "end": 951, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1160, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1239, "end": 1243, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1248, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1348, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1352, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The current PfSPZ vaccine strain, NF54, was isolated from a patient in the Netherlands who had never left the country and is considered a case of \"airport malaria;\" the exact origin of NF54 is unknown [2] , but is thought to be from Africa [23, 24] . NF54 is also the isolate from which the P. falciparum 3D7 reference strain was cloned [25] , and hence, despite having been separated in culture for over 30 years, NF54 and 3D7 are assumed to be genetically identical, and 3D7 is often used in homologous CHMI [5, 7] . Several issues hinder the interpretation of both homologous and heterologous CHMI experiments conducted to date. It remains to be confirmed that 3D7 has remained genetically identical to NF54 genomewide, or that the two are at least identical immunogenically. Indeed, NF54 and 3D7 have several reported phenotypic differences when grown in culture, including the variable ability to produce gametocytes [26] . In addition, 7G8, NF166.C8, and NF135.C10 have not been rigorously compared to each other or to NF54 to confirm that they are adequate heterologous strains, even though they do appear to have distinct infectivity phenotypes when used as CHMI strains [14, 16] . While the entire sporozoite likely offers multiple immunological targets, no high-confidence correlates of protection currently exist. In part because of the difficulty of studying hepatic parasite forms and their gene expression profiles in humans, it remains unclear which parasite proteins are recognized by the human immune system during that stage, and elicit protection, upon immunization with PfSPZ vaccines. Both humoral and cell-mediated responses have been associated with protection against homologous CHMI [5, 6] , although studies in rodents and non-human primates point to a requirement for cell-mediated immunity (specifically through tissue-resident CD8 + T cells) in long-term protection [4, 8, 27, 28] . In silico identification of CD8 + T cell epitopes in all strains could highlight critical differences of immunological significance between strains. Finally, heterologous CHMI results cannot be a reliable indicator of efficacy against infection in field settings unless the CHMI strains used are characteristic of the geographic region from which they originate. These issues could impact the use of homologous and heterologous CHMI, and the choice of strains for these studies, to predict the efficacy of PfSPZ-based vaccines in the field [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 204, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 240, "end": 244, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 245, "end": 248, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 337, "end": 341, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 510, "end": 513, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 514, "end": 516, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1183, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1187, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1711, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1714, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1898, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1901, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1905, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1909, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2456, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "These knowledge gaps can be addressed through a rigorous description and comparison of the genome sequence of these strains.

Recently, longread sequencing technologies have been used to overcome some of these assembly challenges, as was shown with assemblies for 3D7, 7G8, and several other cultureadapted P. falciparum strains generated using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) technology [31] [32] [33] . However, NF166.C8 and NF135.C10 still lack whole-genome assemblies; in addition, while an assembly for 7G8 is available [32] , it is important to characterize the specific 7G8 clone used in heterologous CHMI, from Sanaria's working bank, as strains can undergo genetic changes over time in culture [34] . Here, reference assemblies for NF54, 7G8, NF166.C8, and NF135.C10 (hereafter referred to as PfSPZ strains) were generated using approaches to take advantage of the resolution power of long-read sequencing data and the low error rate of short-read sequencing platforms.

Shared epitopes between NF54 and the three heterologous PfSPZ strains were calculated by first identifying epitopes in each gene, and then removing duplicate epitope sequence entries (caused by recognition by multiple HLA types). Identical epitope sequences that were identified in two or more genes were treated as distinct epitope entries, and all unique \"epitope-given-gene\" combinations were included when calculating the number of shared epitopes between strains. To validate these in silico predictions, the predicted epitopes were compared to a published database of experimentally validated CD8 + T cell epitopes (filtered to remove epitope sequences longer than 20 amino acids in length) [59] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 181, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 550, "end": 554, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 555, "end": 558, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 908, "end": 912, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 941, "end": 944, "text": "58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1678, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 965, "end": 973, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "In silico MHC I epitope predictions"}, {"text": "For the full collection of clinical isolates that had whole genome short-read sequencing data (generated either at IGS or downloaded from SRA), reads were aligned to the 3D7 reference genome (PlasmoDBv24) using bowtie2 (v2.2.4) [51] .

For example, NF166.C8 and NF135.C10 both had domain cassette sequences encoding DC8-and DC13containing PfEMP1s, which have been associated with severe malaria [66] , while 7G8 did not. In addition, a recently characterized PfEMP1 protein expressed on the surface of NF54 sporozoites (NF54var sporo ) was shown to be involved in hepatocyte invasion (Pf3D7_0809100), and antibodies to this PfEMP1 blocked invasion [67] . No ortholog to NF54var sporo was identified in the var repertoire of 7G8, NF166.C8, or NF135.C10; while there were var sequences in the three heterologous CHMI strains that contained the general domain structure (NTS-DBLa-CIDRa-DBLd-CIDRb) of NF54var sporo , none had its specific domain cassette (NTS-DBL\u03b10.12-CIDR\u03b12.2-DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b21) (Additional file 4).

The former is a segmental duplication containing a vacuolar iron transporter (PF3D7_1223700), a putative citrate/oxoglutarate carrier protein (PF3D7_1223800), a putative 50S ribosomal protein L24 (PF3D7_1223900), GTP cyclohydrolase I (PF3D7_1224000), and three conserved Plasmodium proteins of unknown function (PF3D7_1223500, PF3D7_ 1223600, PF3D7_1224100). The expanded region in NF135.C10 represents a tandem expansion of a segment housing the gene encoding the multidrug resistance protein PfMDR1 (PF3D7_0523000), resulting in a total of four copies of this gene in NF135.C10.

The two sequences were identical, likely indicative of incorrect collapsing of the repeat region of PfLSA-1 in the 3D7 reference; NF54 and 3D7 PacBio-based assemblies had 79 units of the 17-mer amino acid repeat, compared to only 43 in the 3D7 reference sequence, a result further validated by the inconsistent depth of mapped Illumina reads from NF54 between the PfLSA repeat region and its flanking unique regions in the 3D7 reference (Additional file 2: Figure S3 ).

However, some may be real, as a small indel causing a frameshift in PF3D7_1417400, a putative protein-coding pseudogene that has previously been shown to accumulate premature stop codons in laboratory-adapted strains [71] , and some may be of biologic importance, such as those seen in two histonerelated proteins (PF3D7_0823300 and PF3D7_1020700). It has been reported that some clones of 3D7, unlike NF54, are unable to consistently produce gametocytes in long-term culture [26] ; no SNPs were observed within or directly upstream of PfAP2-G (PF3D7_1222600) (Additional file 2: Table S6 ), which has been identified as a transcriptional regulator of sexual commitment in P. falciparum [72] . However, 7G8, NF66.C8, and NF135.C10 had numerous non-synonymous mutations and indels within putative AP2 genes (Additional file 2: Table S6 ). A non-synonymous mutation from arginine to proline (R1286P) was observed in an AP2-coincident C-terminal domain of PfAP2-L (PF3D7_0730300), a gene associated with liver stage development [73] , in all PfSPZ strains compared to 3D7. Interestingly, NF135.C10 contained an insertion of almost 200 bp in length relative to 3D7 in the 3\u2032 end of PfAP2-G; the insertion also carried a premature stop codon, leading to a considerably different C-terminal end for the transcription factor (Additional file 2: Figure S4 ). This alternate allele is also present in previously published assemblies for clones from Southeast Asia [32] , including the culture-adapted strain Dd2, and variations of this insertion (without the in-frame stop codon) are also found in several nonhuman malaria Plasmodium species (Additional file 2: Figure S4 ), suggesting an interesting evolutionary trajectory of this sequence. Given that no absolute correlates of protection are known for whole organism P. falciparum vaccines, genetic differences were assessed both across the genome and in pre-erythrocytic genes of interest in the three heterologous CHMI strains. As expected, the number of mutations between 3D7 and these three PfSPZ strains was much higher than observed for NF54, with~40-55 K SNPs and as many indels in each pairwise comparison. Indel length distributions showed distinct patterns in each strain (Additional file 2: Figure S5 ); the expected difference in the length distribution of small indels in coding versus non-coding regions across the genome suggests that most of the remaining indels correspond to true differences relative to 3D7. SNPs were roughly randomly distributed among intergenic regions, silent and non-synonymous sites ( Table 1, Fig. 2) , and corresponding to a pairwise SNP density relative to 3D7 of 1.9, 2.1 and 2.2 SNPs/kbp for 7G8, NF166.C8 and NF135.C10, respectively.

A similar trend was seen when restricting the analyses to non-synonymous SNPs in the core genome (7.3% and 8% more than NF166.C8 and 7G8, respectively).

Inner tracks, from outside to inside, are NF54 (black), 7G8 (green), NF166.C8 (orange), and NF135.C10 (pink). The outermost tracks are the 3D7 reference genome nuclear chromosomes (chrm1 to chrm 14, in blue), followed by 3D7 genes on the forward and reverse strand (black tick marks). Peaks in SNP densities mostly correlate with subtelomeric regions and internal multi-gene family clusters validated epitope sequences failed to overlap with the predicted epitope set (Fig. 4) , at least one of which could be explained by differences in HLA types used in experiments and in silico predictions. The majority of predicted epitopes were shared across all four strains, reflecting epitopes predicted in conserved regions of the 42 genes used in this analysis. Of the three heterologous CHMI strains, NF135.C10 had the highest number of unique epitopes relative to all other strains (n = 65, Fig. 3 ) or to NF54 (n = 153, Additional file 2: Table S8 ). Both 7G8 and NF166.C8 had a similar number of unique epitopes (n = 45 and n = 46, respectively) and of epitopes not shared with NF54 (n = 117 and n = 121, respectively). Indels and repeat regions also sometimes affected the number of predicted epitopes in each antigen for each strain; for example, an insertion in 7G8 near amino acid residue 1600 in PfLISP-2 (PF3D7_0405300) contained additional predicted epitopes (Additional file 2: Figure S9 ). Similar patterns in variation in epitope recognition and frequency were found in other pre-erythrocytic genes of interest, including PfLSA-3 (PF3D7_0220000), PfAMA-1 (PF3D7_1133400), and PfTRAP (PF3D7_ 1335900) (Additional file 2: Figure S9 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 555, "end": 559, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 424, "end": 433, "text": "Figure S8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 664, "end": 670, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1392, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1810, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1861, "text": "Table S8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2310, "text": "Figure S9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2554, "text": "Figure S9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Immunological relevance of genetic variation among PfSPZ strains"}, {"text": "Some of these variations in epitope sequences are relevant for the interpretation of the outcome of PfSPZ vaccine trials. For example, while all four strains are identical in sequence composition in a B cell epitope potentially relevant for protection recently identified PfCSP [75] , another B cell epitope that partially overlaps it [76] contained an A98G amino acid difference in 7G8 and NF135.C10 relative to NF54 and NF166.C8. There was also variability in CD8 + T cell epitopes recognized in the Th2R region of the protein. Specifically, the PfCSP encoded by the 3D7/ NF54 allele was predicted to bind to both HLA-A and HLA-C allele types, but the orthologous protein segments in NF166.C8 and NF135.C10 were only recognized by HLA-A allele types; notably, and given the HLA types studied, no epitope was detected at that position in PfCSP encoded in 7G8 (Fig. 4) . Expansion of the analyses to additional HLA types revealed an allele (HLA-08:01) that is predicted to bind to the Th2R region of the 7G8-encoded PfCSP; however, HLA-08:01 is much more frequent in European populations (10-15%) than in African populations (1-6%) [56] . Therefore, if CD8 + T cell epitopes in the Th2R region of 7G8 are important for protection, which is currently unknown, the level of protection against CHMI with 7G8 observed in volunteers of European descent may not be informative of PfSPZ vaccine efficacy in Africa.

The analyses described here, using high-quality de novo genome assemblies, expand the analysis to hard-to-call regions, For the genome-wide dataset, coordinate 1 separated South American and African isolates from Southeast Asian and Papua New Guinean isolates (27.6% of variation explained), coordinate two separated African isolates from South American isolates (10.7%), and coordinate three separated Southeast Asian isolates from Papua New Guinea (PNG) isolates (3.0%). Similar trends were found for the first two coordinates seen for the pre-erythrocytic gene data set (27.1 and 12.6%, respectively), but coordinate three separated isolates from all three regions (3.8%).

Long-read sequencing also confirmed that differences observed between the NF54 and 3D7 assemblies in a major liver stage antigen, PfLSA-1, represent one of a small number of errors lingering in the reference 3D7 genome, which is being continually updated and improved [33] . Confirmation that NF54 and 3D7 are identical at this locus is critical when 3D7 has been used as a homologous CHMI in whole sporozoite, NF54-based vaccine studies.

As expected, 7G8, NF166.C8, and NF135.C10 were genetically very distinct from NF54 and 3D7, with thousands of differences across the genome including dozens in known pre-erythrocytic antigens. The identification of sequence variants (both SNPs and indels) within transcriptional regulators, such as the AP2 family, may assist in the study of different growth phenotypes in these strains. NF166.C8 and NF135.C10 merozoites enter the bloodstream several days earlier than those of NF54 [14] , suggesting that NF54 may develop more slowly in hepatocytes than do the other two strains.

First, of the three heterologous strains, NF135.C10 is the most divergent from NF54, containing the highest numbers of unique SNPs and epitope sequences relative to the vaccine strain, which was expected from their respective geographic origins. However, results were less consistent for NF166.C8 and 7G8. Given its South American origin, 7G8 was expected to have more unique variants relative to NF54 than NF166.C8 did, but this was not always the case (for example, NF166.C8 had a slightly higher number of unique epitopes relative to NF54, compared to 7G8). These results show that the practice of equating geographic distance to genetic differentiation is not always valid and that the interpretation of CHMI studies should rest upon thorough genome-wide comparisons. Lastly, since, of all PfSPZ strains, NF135.C10 is the most genetically distinct from NF54, if proteome-wide genetic divergence is the primary determinant of differences in protection against different parasites, the extent to which NF54based immunization protects against CHMI with NF135.C10 is important in understanding the ability of PfSPZ vaccine and other whole-organism malaria vaccines to protect against diverse parasites present worldwide. These conclusions are drawn from genome-wide analyses and from subsets of genes for which a role in whole-sporozoite-induced protection is suspected but not experimentally established.

However, these data can potentially be used for the rational design of multi-strain sporozoite-based vaccines once knowledge of those critical epitope sequences is available. Characterization of a variety of P. falciparum strains may facilitate the development of region-specific or multi-strain vaccines with greater protective efficacy. Support for a genomics-guided approach to guide such next-generation vaccines can be found in other whole organism parasitic vaccines. Field trials testing the efficacy of first-generation whole killed-parasite vaccines against Leishmania had highly variable results [85] . While most studies failed to show protection, indicating that killed, whole-cell vaccines for leishmaniasis may not produce the necessary protective response, a trial demonstrating significant protection utilized a multi-strain vaccine, with strains collected from the immediate area of the trial [86] , highlighting the importance of understanding the distribution of genetic diversity in pathogen populations. In addition, a highly efficacious nonattenuated, three-strain, whole organism vaccine exists against Theileria parva, a protozoan parasite that causes East coast fever in cattle. This vaccine, named Muguga Cocktail, consists of a mix of three live strains of T. parva that are administered in an infection-andtreatment method, similar to the approach utilized by PfSPZ-CVac. It has been shown recently that two of the strains are genetically very similar, possibly clones of the same isolates [87] . Despite this, the vaccine remains highly efficacious and in high demand [88] . In addition, the third vaccine strain in the Muguga Cocktail is quite distinct from the other two, with~5 SNPs/kb [87] , or about twice the SNP density seen between NF54 and other PfSPZ strains. These observations suggest that an efficacious multi-strain vaccine against a highly variable parasite species does not need to contain a large number of strains, but that the inclusion of highly divergent strains may be warranted.
