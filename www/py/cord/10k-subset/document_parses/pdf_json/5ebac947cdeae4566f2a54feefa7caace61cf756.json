In this work, the informational content of overlapping genes belonging to prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses was analyzed. Using information theory indices, we identified in the regions of overlap a first pattern, exhibiting a more uniform base composition and more severe constraints in base ordering with respect to the nonoverlapping regions. This pattern was found to be peculiar to coliphage, avian hepatitis B virus, human lentivirus, and plant luteovirus families. A second pattern, characterized by the occurrence of similar compositional constraints in both types of coding regions, was found to be limited to plant tymoviruses. At the level of codon usage, a low degree of correlation between overlapping and nonoverlapping coding regions characterized the first pattern, whereas a close link was found in tymoviruses, indicating a fine adaptation of the overlapping frame to the original codon choice of the virus. As a result of codon usage correlation analysis, deductions concerning the origin and evolution of several overlapping frames were also proposed. Comparison of amino acid composition revealed an increased frequency of amino acid residues with a high level of degeneracy (arginine, leucine, and serine) in the proteins encoded by overlapping genes; this peculiar feature of overlapping genes can be viewed as a way with which they may expand their coding ability and gain new, specialized functions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "A particular issue in the statistical analysis of genomic DNA sequences concerns the characterization of codes and semantic patterns in the genetic language (Trifonov 1989; Smith 1989) . In this language, overlapping genes represent an unusual pattern, as two, or exceptionally three, out-of-phase reading frames may lie in a single nucleotide sequence. Such an arrangement, called ''overprinting,'' is frequent in viruses, where it probably evolved to increase the density of genetic information (Lamb and Horvath 1991) . The first genes of this type were identified by Barrell and co-workers (1976) in the genome of X174, a single-stranded DNA phage, and similar overlapping regions were later detected in many other genes belonging to DNA or RNA viruses of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Normark et al. 1983; Samuel 1989 and references therein) . Translation of the different reading frames has been shown to be mediated by ribosomal frameshifting, which requires an upstream site of ribosomal slippage and a downstream stem-loop structure known as a ''RNA pseudoknot'' (Jacks et al. 1988 ; Wilson et al. 1988; Brierley et al. 1989 ).

The overlapping regions of tymovirus family were considered, instead, as two distinct sets of data, the one including the overlapping region of replicase gene, the other the 69-kD protein gene.

The use of information theory indices shows that viral sequences, albeit deriving from different sources, can be referred to two distinct patterns. Considering that (Luo et al. 1988 ) ''the smallness of D 1 represents the abundance of vocabulary and the largeness of D 2 represents the clarity of grammatical rules,'' the informational measures of overlapping sequences related to the first pattern (a low D 1 value, a high D 2 value, see Fig. 2 ) suggest a level of genetic information storage closely resembling natural languages.

For example, the codon usage pattern of overlapping frames encoding the structural ''scaffolding'' B and D proteins is well correlated (an r value of 0.55 and 0.68, respectively) with that of the nonoverlapping genes, which encode the similarly structural J, F, G, and H proteins. This relatively high degree of correlation suggests an ancient origin for the B and D frames. On the other hand, the highly peculiar choice of synonyms in the genes E and K, which are entirely embedded within the D and A/C genes and exhibit an r value of 0.02 and 0.03, respectively, supports the idea of a more recent acquisition. Since a low expression of the gene E is necessary and sufficient to induce lysis of the host cell (Blasi et al. 1990 ), its peculiar codon usage pattern could represent a mechanism to regulate the rate of translation, thus preventing premature lysis of the host. A low expression during infectious cycle could also be required for the gene K, whose regulative role consists in increasing the burst size of phage production (Gillam et al. 1985) . The codon usage pattern of the region of gene A which overlaps both B and K genes (an r value of 0.13 with the nonoverlapping frames) contrasts with that found in the nonoverlapping part of the gene A (an r value of 0.91). This observation suggests that a shorter gene A originally terminated in close proximity to a preexisting gene B and that the present overlapping arrangement evolved by a new termination codon of the gene A beyond the gene B. In a similar way, the codon usage of the overlapping fraction of gene C (an r value of 0.01 with the regions of nonoverlap) markedly differs from that occurring in the nonoverlapping region (an r value of 0.41). Considering that the gene C of X174, G4, and \u24233 coliphages contains a second in-phase ATG codon localized in the nonoverlapping region, we predict an originally shorter gene C which evolved using as initiator codon an upstream ATG localized at the end of the gene A.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 919, "end": 937, "text": "(Blasi et al. 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1244, "end": 1264, "text": "(Gillam et al. 1985)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 190, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The alternative pattern revealed by the information Fig. 3 . Frequency of occurrence of chi-square values above the 3.8 cutoff value which reflect a significantly higher content of individual amino acid residues in proteins encoded by overlapping genes. is preserved in the overlapping regions (A \u202b\u05e1\u202c 21%, T \u202b\u05e1\u202c 23%, G \u202b\u05e1\u202c 16%, C \u202b\u05e1\u202c 40%), and this excess of C residues tends to be clustered in the third base position of codons. In fact, a 49% content of C residues occurs in the third base position of nonoverlapping regions, a 44% content in the replicase protein (RP) overlapping frame, and a 36% content in the 69-kD protein overlapping frame. The high degree of relationship in the codon usage (an r mean value of 0.82) likely suggests that, at variance with the case of X174, the infectious cycle of tymoviruses may require, in all coding regions, a more uniform adaptation to the translationary machinery of the host. Tymoviruses infect various members of the Cruciferae (e.g., Brassica rapa, Arabidopsis thaliana) and they accumulate in leaves (Bozarth et al. 1992) , where the highly expressed genes code for the small subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and for the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (Murray et al. 1989 ). Interestingly, the third base positions of the coding regions of these latter genes show a frequency of C residues (40%) similar to that occurring in all different frames of tymoviruses. Since the base frequency at third degenerate position in nonoverlapping regions (A \u202b\u05e1\u202c 16%, T \u202b\u05e1\u202c 21%, C \u202b\u05e1\u202c 49%, G \u202b\u05e1\u202c 14%) is closely similar to RP overlapping frame (A \u202b\u05e1\u202c 19%, T \u202b\u05e1\u202c 18%, C \u202b\u05e1\u202c 44%, G \u202b\u05e1\u202c 19%) and contrasts with 69-kD protein frame (A \u202b\u05e1\u202c 24%, T \u202b\u05e1\u202c 29%, C \u202b\u05e1\u202c 36%, G \u202b\u05e1\u202c 11%), we can also predict that this latter overlapping gene arose later by superimposition on a preexisting RP gene. The statistical analysis of the amino acid composition evidenced that the peculiar amino-acid usage occurring in overlapping genes can be mainly ascribed to a significantly higher frequency of amino acid residues having the highest level of codon degeneracy (Fig. 3) . For example, the high content of leucine and arginine residues in the overlapping region of lentivirus Env gene (Table 3) is related to a very peculiar choice of synonyms (Leu/ CTA 4.9%; Leu/TTA 16.9%; Leu/CTC 29.0%, Arg/ AGA 31.9%, Arg/CGC 17.0%), when compared with that occurring in the lentivirus nonoverlapping regions (Leu/CTA 18.6%; Leu/TTA 34.2%; Leu/CTC 6.5%; Arg/AGA 65.0%; Arg/CGC 0.7%).
