In the United States, Waldemar Johanson described that the pharyngeal flora of patients changed within a few days after hospital admission; from predominantly Gram-positive to predominantly Gram-negative bacteria [4] . Subsequent studies revealed that these Gram-negative bacteria were the main causes of hospital-acquired infections (at that time), especially of nosocomial pneumonias. Around the same time, a Dutch clinical microbiologist, Dick van der Waaij, described the interaction between gut flora and infections in neutropenic gnotobiotic mice [5] . He demonstrated that conservation of the anaerobic intestinal flora prevented such mice from bacterial overgrowth with Gram-negative bacteria and subsequent infections. He called this phenomenon \"colonization resistance\". In those days, these observations were based on conventional microbiological culture techniques. Yet, this concept-a healthy gut flora that prevents infection-has now been repeatedly confirmed in studies using deep sequencing technologies.",

The targeted pathogens for prevention were the Enterobacterales (e.g., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The intestinal flora was considered the source of these potential pathogenic micro-organisms for colonization of the upper respiratory tract during hospitalization. Therefore, topical antibiotics were chosen that were not absorbed (to avoid systemic distribution), that were active against the listed pathogens and that would not disturb the anaerobic flora. As such, the combination of an aminoglycoside (tobramycin) and colistin was selected, and these antibiotics were administered in an oropharyngeal paste applied in the buccal cavity and as a solution inserted through the nasogastric tube (both four times daily) (Fig. 1 ). Initial small studies, mainly in trauma patients, led to two modifications of the regimen. Amphotericin B was added to prevent overgrowth with yeasts. Furthermore, a prophylactic 4-day course of a cephalosporin-cefotaxime-(not active against anaerobes) was added to treat any incubating infection caused by the commensal flora of the respiratory tract at the time of hospital admission. The choice of cefotaxime was motivated by the assumption that trauma patients would have-at the time of trauma and immediate hospital admission-a normal respiratory tract flora susceptible to a third-generation cephalosporin. In later SDD studies, enrolled patient populations gradually changed to also include surgical and medical patients, with extensive medical histories, including prior antibiotic use and carriage with bacteria non-susceptible to cefotaxime.",

Waivers were granted, because SDD was considered part of daily ICU practice in each country. At the same time, there was true equipoise on the effects of SDD, leading to marked differences in practice between ICUs. Moreover, SDD (and SOD) were considered safe and it was acknowledged that a cluster-randomized study would not be feasible without such a waiver. The waivers allowed an immediate start of SDD after ICU admission and enrollment of 6000 patients and more [7, 8, 10] .",

Therefore, the consequences of patients not being treated systemically during these 4 days remain unknown, as the relative contribution of systemic antibiotics to the overall effect of SDD has never been determined in a single study. In a Cochrane review, including 36 studies involving 6914 patients treated in ICUs published until March 2009, the combination of topical plus systemic antibiotics was associated with less infections and deaths, whereas regimens of only topical treatment were associated with less infections but not with less deaths [18] .

In one study from the Netherlands, colonization of the gut with Gramnegative bacteria was determined upon ICU discharge and on day 10 after ICU discharge, in patients that had received either SDD or SOD in ICU [22] . SDD resulted in more effective decontamination of the gut at the time of ICU discharge and led to lower acquisition rates on day 10 after ICU discharge, although colonization rates on day 10 after ICU discharge were similar in both study groups [22] .",

In one study, changes in the gut microbiome during SDD were investigated using metagenomics in a single patient during and after ICU admission [23] . SDD was associated with an increase in the abundance of resistance genes, mostly of aminoglycoside resistance genes carried by anaerobe gut bacteria, which was confirmed in 12 other patients. In a subsequent study, the same investigators analyzed the gut microbiome in ten ICU patients that received SDD [24] . For comparison, gut microbiota were also determined twice in ten healthy subjects with a 1-year interval. The microbiota of the ICU patients differed from those of healthy subjects and was characterized by lower microbial diversity, decreased levels of Escherichia coli and of anaerobic Gram-positive, butyrate-producing bacteria of the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, and an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and enterococci. Four types of resistance genes, providing resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, disinfectants, and tetracyclines, were significantly more abundant among ICU patients than in healthy subjects. These findings confirm the principles of SDD, eradicate Enterobacterales but not anaerobes from the gut, but more studies are needed to better determine the effects of SDD on selection and transmission of resistance genes.",

Yet, the Selective Decontamination of the Digestive Tract in Intensive Care Unit Patients (SuDDICU) trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02389036) is another cluster, cross-over, randomized-controlled trial of SDD in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. It is currently recruiting a target of 12,000-15,000 patients in Canada, the UK, and Australia. Patients not already receiving an intravenous therapeutic antibiotic will be prescribed a 4-day course of intravenous cephalosporins. The study has a concurrent cohort study nested within the randomized trial for evaluating the effects of SDD on antibiotic resistance patterns. These recruiting countries are countries with the least moderate rate of antibiotic resistance, and therefore, the results will give us more information about the use of SDD in these populations. The study will also have costeffectiveness analyses, microbiome/meta genetic analysis, and a process evaluation undertaken in Canada and Australia to understand the broader patient, health care practitioner, and ecological and health system implications of delivering SDD. The study will report in 2021.",
