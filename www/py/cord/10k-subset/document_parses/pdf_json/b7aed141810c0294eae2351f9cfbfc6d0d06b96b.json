The possibility of IRIS due to respiratory virus infection (5 patients with parainfluenza and 1 patient with RSV) has been reported in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients who presented with post-engraftment pneumonitis after HCT [26, 28] . However, we did not observe differences in lymphocyte engraftment dynamics between progressors and nonprogressors (Figure 2A and 2B) , suggesting that profound lymphopenia and the associated immune defect rather than an IRIS phenomenon is responsible for progression to LRD. RSV-specific antibodies play an important role in the prevention of RSV disease in young children [29, 30] . Palivizumab prophylaxis has been documented to prevent serious RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [31] but has shown only very limited success in treatment situations [6, 19, [32] [33] [34] [35] . In elderly immunocompetent persons, having RSV antibody level below 10 log 2 was associated with more hospitalization and ICU care [36] .

Although we were only able to perform this analysis in a relatively small subset of patients, we were unable to detect any trends. Therefore, if an effect of subtype on disease progression is present, it is likely to be small. Active smoking before HCT was a risk factor for progression in this study.

In addition, there are a few case series studies reporting the effect of oral or intravenous ribavirin treatment, which needs further evaluation [46, 47] Our study has several strengths and limitations. Although we included clinical data from a large number of patients who initially presented with RSV URI, sera for RSV specific antibody test were available only in a subset of recipients and donors (less than half), and RSV virus subtype was also only available in 76 patients. Therefore, smaller effect sizes associated with RSV subtypes or RSV-specific antibody levels may have been missed.
