Our analyses indicate that viral species infecting domestic artiodactyls are more likely to infect humans if they complete replication in the cytoplasm without nuclear entry. The observed effect of cytoplasmic replication on host-jumping ability is not surprising given the complex molecular pathways regulating nuclear entry. Viral species that are unable to complete replication in the cytoplasm require intracellular transport from the site of penetration, targeting of the nucleus through nuclear localization signals, and importation of genetic material, proteins, and/or whole virions through the nuclear pore complex [10] . The combination of molecular mechanisms governing this chain of events is likely to be highly host specific, because of strong selective pressure against admission of foreign particles into the nucleus. To date, discussion of barriers to viral replica-tion has largely focused on receptors for cellular entry. The concentration on this aspect of the viral life cycle exists for 2 substantive reasons. First, the inability to enter a cell obviously precludes viral replication; second, several well-documented viral host jumps have been shown to occur after point mutations that modify interactions between viral particles and cellular receptors [11] [12] [13] . The effect of nuclear entry seen in our data set emphasizes that cellular entry, while a necessary step, is insufficient for completion of the viral life cycle.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1288, "end": 1292, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1297, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The ability to produce genetic diversity is the factor most widely discussed as expected to increase viral host-jumping ability [1, [3] [4] [5] 14] .
