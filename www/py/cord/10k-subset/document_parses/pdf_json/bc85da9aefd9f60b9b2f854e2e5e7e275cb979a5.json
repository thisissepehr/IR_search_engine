The difference in learning outcomes was extreme. Observations of what was happening in the classrooms showed subtle but decisive differences correlated with the differences in outcome. These differences were interpreted in terms of the theory used by the first group, and the results seem to give support to the theoretical claim that for any specific object of learning there is a necessary pattern of variation and invariance that the learners must experience in order to appropriate the object of learning in question and thus by bringing out that pattern in the learning situation, the likelihood of that object of learning being appropriated is enhanced.

This topic was chosen for two reasons. First, it includes some of the most difficult concepts for school children at this level. Many candidates in the Hong Kong public examination failed to discern that both the supply of and demand for a commodity affected its market price, which required a comparison of the magnitude of changes in both its demand and supply (Hong Kong Examinations Authority, 1992 , 1995 .

Take the simultaneous increase in demand and supply as an example. An increase in demand for a good with constant supply will lead to a rise in price, whereas an increase in supply with constant demand will lead to a fall in price. It is obvious that the effects of these two changes on price are opposite and counteracting. Thus, to determine the combined effects of a simultaneous increase in demand and supply on price, one needs to look at which magnitude of increase is greater. If the magnitude of increase in demand is relatively greater than that of supply, then the price will rise, and vice versa. For the reverse case the result will be reversed.

Some children discern and focus on the 'many-ness aspect' of numbers, others discern the sequential aspect, some discern and focus on both at the same time, and others discern none of these aspects (Marton & Booth, 1997) . However, to discern 'many-ness' the child must have experienced variation in that aspect. They cannot experience the 'seven-ness' of seven, for instance, without experiencing the 'six-ness' of six and the 'eight-ness' of eight.

After observing the lessons of Teacher 1, Teacher 2 decided to devise a computer program to demonstrate the dynamic changes in the relative magnitude of change in demand and supply. Instead of using the blackboard, the teacher used information technology in such a way that the simultaneous movements of the two curves were exhibited in a dynamic manner to show the relationship between the relative magnitude of change in demand and supply and price changes (see Figure 3 ). The change in price was demonstrated to be dependent on changes in the relative magnitude of changes in supply and demand, as was shown by the continuous movements of the supply and demands curves from left to right (or the other way around).
