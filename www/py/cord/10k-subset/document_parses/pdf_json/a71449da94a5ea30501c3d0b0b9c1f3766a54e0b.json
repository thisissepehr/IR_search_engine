The principal findings in the first report [13] were that lower respiratory tract complications developed during 45 (25%) of 179 upper respiratory tract episodes including 3 of 12 coronavirus infections, 3 of 9 respiratory syncytial virus infections, 2 of 4 adenovirus infections, 1 of 11 rhinovirus infections, but none of 5 influenza infections, the latter being identified by the complement fixation test. Respiratory infections were caused mostly by pathogens other than influenza during the influenza period documented nationally and the different viruses caused illnesses that were clinically indistinguishable. Thus there is considerable potential for influenza to be overdiagnosed by medical practitioners and patients and the efficacy of influenza vaccine could be underestimated accordingly. This second report concerns the levels of influenza antibody, as measured by single-radial haemolysis and haemagglutination inhibition assays, in vaccinated and nonvaccinated elderly residents, and the effectiveness of vaccine.",

Patients with increasing dyspnoea, wheeze, severe cough, or productive cough for at least 2 days were deemed to have lower respiratory tract involvement. Details of the patients' medical, drug, and immunization histories for 1985 to 1988 were obtained from the medical practitioners and home wardens.

In mammalian species there is a decline in immune function that begins at the time of sexual maturation and progresses throughout life [15] . Antibody responses decline with ageing [16, 17] , and the response of elderly people to influenza vaccine tends to be lower than in younger individuals [12, 18] , especially when Note: a = vaccine strain, b = prevailing H1N1 strain during winter 1988-9. there are concurrent medical conditions such as malignancy or cardiovascular disease [17, 19] . The period between collection of pre-and postvaccination sera in most studies of vaccination of elderly people has usually been several weeks [20] , and, since as many as one-half of all those vaccinated do not achieve HI titres greater than 40 [12] and the HI antibody response may be of brief duration [21, 22] , it is perhaps not surprising that the elderly residential patients in Leicester had such low HI titres despite vaccination. Despite the low titres the attack rate for influenza A and B only reached 4.1% in vaccinated and 10% in non-vaccinated symptomatic residents, and, although the incidence was more than twice as high in those not vaccinated, that difference is not statistically significant.

This is not a universal finding [25] , however, and was not demonstrated in the current study. Our study, which was based on 170 symptomatic individuals in homes with 515 beds, illustrates how unrewarding influenza vaccination of elderly residential people can be during nonepidemic years. The trend towards protection in this study is in keeping with similar trends in previous studies in homes for the elderly, and, until the failure of vaccination is established by large well designed prospective studies, we believe that vaccine delivery to current target groups should be improved and that the search for better influenza vaccines should continue.",
