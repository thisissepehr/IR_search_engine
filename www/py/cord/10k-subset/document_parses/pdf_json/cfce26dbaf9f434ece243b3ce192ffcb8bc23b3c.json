The possible role of a virus or viruses is supported by data that (1) a childhood exposure is involved and \"viral\" infections may precipitate exacerbations of disease, (2) experimental infections in animals and natural infections in humans can cause diseases with long incubation periods, remitting and relapsing courses, and demyelination, and (3) patients with multiple sclerosis have abnormal immune responses to viruses. The pathogenesis of three human demyelinating diseases of known viral etiology is discussed. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a papovavirus selectively infects oligodendrocytes and causes focal areas of demyelination. In postmeasles encephalomyelitis, the virus is lymphotrophic and disrupts immune regulation that can result in an autoimmune perivenular demyelinating illness without evidence of infection of the central nervous system. In human immunodeficiency virus-encephalopathy and myelopathy virus is present in macrophages and microglia and the myelin abnormalities apparently are caused by soluble factors such as viral proteins, cytokines, or neurotoxins.

After the rash abates and the child is returning to activities outside the house, there is a sudden recurrence of fever, decrease in consciousness, often seizures, and multifocal neurological signs. The disease has an abrupt onset, often reaching its nadir within the first 24 hours. Mortality is approximately 2096, and sequelae persist in the majority of survivors. The electroencephalogram is slow but nonspecific, and the CSF usually shows a mild elevation of protein and some mononuclear cells, but in about one-third of the patients the CSF is entirely normal.

Indeed, measles remains one of the three major killing infectious diseases worldwide, causing about 1.5 million childhood deaths per year [341. The majority of these deaths are not due to encephalomyelitis, however, but to opportunistic infections that complicate the decreased immune responses seen for several weeks following the measles rash. Thus, in contrast to PML, measles virus appears to induce the immune deficiency, and opportunistic infections lead to death.

There is activation of lymphoid cells and spontaneous proliferation of lymphocytes (T4, T8, and B cells) (Table 3 ). Rather than immunosuppression, measles virus produces an activation of lymphocytes and macrophages stimulating immunoresponsive cells such as those responsive to myelin basic protein; proliferation of culture lymphocytes in the presence of myelin basic protein was found in 15% of the cases of measles without neurological findings and in 47% of those who developed encephalomyelitis 1461.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 814, "end": 822, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Postinfectious Encephalomyelitis"}, {"text": "Evidence suggests that measles virus may not directly invade the nervous system.

We have learned that viruses can produce disease with long incubation periods, remimng and relapsing courses, and the loss of myelin with relative sparing of axons. In the case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, the most straightforward mechanism of demyelination proved operative, i.e., selective infection destroys ohgodendrocytes. The identification of the infectious agent, however, required two steps. First, electron microscopic studies were necessary to know what kind of viruses to look for, and second, laboratory methods had to be developed to recover a new and previously unknown papovavirus. In posuneasles encephalomyelitis and in HIV infections, no infection of oligodendrocytes has been found to explain virus-induced demyelination. In postmeasles encephalomyelitis the etiologic agent has been identified only by the very characteristic manifestation of the systemic disease. At the time encephalitis develops, usually no intrathecal antibody synthesis is found and the virus is not recovered from the central nervous system. Indeed, OUT studies suggest that virus may have never been in the central nervous system. In this disease an indirect mechanism may be operative, and if an anale gous mechanism occurred in multiple sclerosis virus would need to be sought in lymphoid tissues prior to the clinical manifestations of the demyelinating disease. Demyelination of the central nervous system in AIDS shows unique morphological changes in a new disease, due to a new virus. The virus is present in the central nervous system, but it is present in the \"wrong\" cells; a correlation between the amount of virus and the amount of disease is lacking, making it hard to fulfill even the most liberal modifications of Koch's postulates [86] .
