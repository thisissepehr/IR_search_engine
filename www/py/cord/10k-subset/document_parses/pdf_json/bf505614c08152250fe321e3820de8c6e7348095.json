Most scientific hubs are based on existing strong research universities, but Shenzhen had no such academic core. So the high-tech industrial park came first, in 1996, led in its early years by Liu Yingli, who subsequently became executive vice-mayor and a key force behind Shenzhen's economic development. Then, in 2001, the city persuaded the graduate schools to set up shop as University Town. Before this, there was just one university, Shenzhen University, which had around 25 graduate students. \"That wasn't enough for a modern city, \" says Zhang Rulin, deputy director of University Town. Of the 4,500 students now studying in University Town, 800 are pursuing PhDs.",

After earning a medical degree in China, she gained research expertise in oncology and haematology in Canada and the United States before moving to Hong Kong, while keeping an eye on China's political and intellectual environment. She's glad she made the move, noting that the Shenzhen students are of the highest quality and as bright as any she's worked with elsewhere.",

Then in 1980, Communist Party chairman Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen, located in Guangdong province just a few miles from Hong Kong, as a 'special economic zone' , where tax policies encouraged foreign investment and trade. Since then the city has boomed, with its population growing to 12 million and fishing shacks being razed in favour of towering skyscrapers.",
