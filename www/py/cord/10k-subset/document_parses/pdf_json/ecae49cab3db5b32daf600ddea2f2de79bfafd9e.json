The advantage of these techniques is its sensitivity and quick turnaround time. Some molecular techniques for infl uenza diagnosis include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), multiplex PCR, real time RT-PCR, nucleic acid based amplifi cation (NASBA) and loop mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) (Khanna and Srivastava 2006) . The most commonly used technique for rapid detection of infl uenza viruses is RT-PCR. It is extremely sensitive and rapid (Wright et al 1995) . A reverse multiplex PCR is employed for typing and subtyping of number of different infl uenza strains together. The appropriate combination of primer sets and optimizations of PCR conditions allow formation of multiplex PCR for detection of infl uenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B from clinical samples (Stockton 1998) . The advent of molecular methods such as real time PCR has allowed improvement of detection methods currently used in laboratories, although not all of these methods include an internal positive control (IPC) to monitor for false negative results. A one-step reverse transcription real time PCR (RRT-PCR) with a minor groove binder (MGB) probe, for the detection of different subtypes of AIVs (against the HA and NA gene) has also been (Lee and Suaraz 2004) designed. The PCR is performed and the corresponding graphs indicate the type, sub-types and amount of the viral strains without performing agarose gel analysis (Trani et al 2006) . Most recent rapid, sensitive technique which is not found to be affected by other biological compounds in the clinical samples is called loop mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) which is conducted under isothermal conditions of 60-65 \u02daC by using enzyme called Bst DNA polymerase.
