Hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir therapy are generally restricted to severe cases but also systematically recommended in newborns in France, irrespective of the clinical severity of the infection. This recommendation was launched in 1998 when Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunoglobulins were not available in the country and has remained unchanged since. The aim of this prospective observational study was to describe complications of varicella infection in a population of 745 children hospitalized for varicella before 1 year of age, with a specific focus on newborns. Complications occurred in 65% of cases. They were very rare before the age of 1 month (10%) but their incidence then increased progressively with age and probably the disappearance of maternal antibodies: 42% (1-2 months), 66% (3-5 months), 70% (6-8 months), and 79% (9-12 months). Conclusion Chickenpox is usually mild in newborns because most of them are protected by VZV maternal antibodies. Unless the absence of maternal VZV immunity is demonstrated, newborns with mild chickenpox should not require antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "In France, hospitalization rate for chickenpox is high before the age of 5 years, particularly during the first year of life [3] . The main reason for hospital admission in this age group is bacterial superinfection, especially of the skin and soft tissues [4, 6, 12] . Mortality peaks before 1 year of age (median 5.5 months), but Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is rarely fatal during the first 2 months of life, probably owing to the protection conferred by maternal antibodies [15] . It is also generally agreed that anti-VZV antibodies transmitted during pregnancy persist until 6 months after birth [1, 5] , but some authors have reported a shorter period of 3 to 4 months [7, 11, 14] . Newborns of mothers who exhibit chickenpox between 5 days before and 2 days after delivery, as well as some premature babies (after 28 weeks of gestation when mother lacks a reliable history of varicella and before 28 weeks of gestation or \u22641,000 g of weight regardless of maternal history of varicella), are particularly at risk of severe disease and are the subject of commonly accepted specific guidelines using VZV-specific immunoglobulins [13] . However, guidelines differ upon countries for newborns developing post-natally acquired chickenpox [2, 8, 13] . Hospitalization and intravenous (IV) acyclovir therapy are generally restricted to severe cases but systematically recommended in France from birth to the age of 28 days [2, 13] . When the French guidelines were published in 1998, VZV-specific immunoglobulins were not available in France. Thus, only IV acyclovir was recommended and targeted to newborns whom mother presented varicella between 5 days before and 2 days after delivery, but also newborns (0 to 28 days old) with varicella and infants before the age of 1 year with severe disease [2] . However, the presence of maternally acquired antibodies which might protect the newborn against severe disease is not taken into account in these guidelines.",

The main reason for hospitalization was young age (79.2%, 38/48) and complications were rare (10.4%, 5/48) ( Table 2) . Acyclovir was, however, given in 86.7% of cases (39/45), IV in 27 cases, IV then orally in 11 cases, and orally in one case. The median total duration of acyclovir treatment was 6 days (1-15 days) and the median duration of IV infusion was 5 days (1-12 days).",

Such patients might have been cared differently in other countries. The situation of a newborn infected after birth, whose mother has a history of chickenpox, is the simplest for the practitioner since the newborn is protected by maternal antibodies and should be kept at home with simple monitoring. The decision is more difficult when the mother's VZV immune status is unknown, although more than 90% of women of child-bearing potential are immune to VZV in Western Europe [1, 9] . In tropical countries, this seroprevalence is much lower [10] . Unfortunately, in this study, data concerning mothers' antibodies status were not available. It would be interesting to complete our study with the systematic determination of VZV antibodies status for infants and their mothers. Such information is useless when the mother is the index case to the newborn. In our study, the only newborn infected by his mother after 2 days of life had no complications but nonetheless received acyclovir.",
