Because most of these particles have club-shaped or bulbous instead of the knob-like projections that are characteristic of coronaviruses [17] , they have been referred to as myxovirus-like [18] . Dourmashkin et al. [19] even suggest that the \"coronavirus-like\" particles may represent a yeast-like organism such as Blastocystis. Most authors agree, however, that the particles represent viruses and that they are more coronavirus-like than myxovirus-like. The myxoviruses have a narrower, more compact fringe with rigid spikes that tend to be sharp or pointed. The variation in surface projections has already been described for the avian infectious bronchitis virus [20, 21] . In view of this documented evidence of variation, Caul et al. [22] believed that the important criterion for the identification of human enteric coronaviruses in clinical material is the length of the projections in conjunction with their radiating appearance rather than their shape. Nonspecific cell membranes and inner mitochondrial membranes present in fecal material tend to have shorter surface projections and are not usually present in large numbers. Therefore, the possession of classic petal-shaped projections must no longer be considered a prerequisite for coronavirus identification [7, 23] . We think that these pleomorphic particles are somehow related to the cor-35 onaviruses because we have consistently observed them in large numbers in stools containing the more classic coronaviruses (figure 5). Naqi et al. [24] , in a study of transmissible (coronaviral) enteritis of turkeys, show an electron micrograph similar to figure 5. Whether this variation reflects different morphologic stages in coronavirus development, an effect of intestine-associated enzymes or antibodies on fringe morphology, or strain variations remains to be determined. Our immune electron microscopic studies show definite clumping of envelopes without readily identifiable fringes next to the definite fringed particles. This result may be an indication of the presence of envelope-associated viral antigens and might explain some of the variation in fringe morphology seen in the direct examination of stool specimens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 262, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 310, "end": 314, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 788, "end": 792, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 861, "end": 865, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1398, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1402, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1628, "end": 1632, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaucher et al."}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Feline infectious peritonitis: a worldwide survey", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Horzinek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["D M E"], "last": "Osterhaus", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1979, "venue": "Am.
