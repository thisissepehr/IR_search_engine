            "text": "Background: During the last century, WHO led public health interventions that resulted in spectacular achievements such as the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the elimination of malaria from the Western world. However, besides major successes achieved worldwide in infectious diseases control, most elimination/control programs remain frustrating in many tropical countries where specific biological and socio-economical features prevented implementation of disease control over broad spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples include malaria, yellow fever, measles and HIV. There is consequently an urgent need to develop affordable and sustainable disease control strategies that can target the core of infectious diseases transmission in highly endemic areas. Discussion: Meanwhile, although most pathogens appear so difficult to eradicate, it is surprising to realize that human activities are major drivers of the current high rate of extinction among upper organisms through alteration of their ecology and evolution, i.e., their \"niche\". During the last decades, the accumulation of ecological and evolutionary studies focused on infectious diseases has shown that the niche of a pathogen holds more dimensions than just the immune system targeted by vaccination and treatment. Indeed, it is situated at various intra-and inter-host levels involved on very different spatial and temporal scales. After developing a precise definition of the niche of a pathogen, we detail how major advances in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology of infectious diseases can enlighten the planning and implementation of infectious diseases control in tropical countries with challenging economic constraints. Summary: We develop how the approach could translate into applied cases, explore its expected benefits and constraints, and we conclude on the necessity of such approach for pathogen control in low-income countries.",

These examples are the most striking in an array of spectacular achievements of public health interventions coordinated by WHO for the last 60 years.

            "text": "Meanwhile, in many tropical countries, infectious diseases continue to exert a major toll on human populations and directly contribute to poverty and economic instability [6] . Pathogen richness is indeed generally higher in the tropics than in temperate areas [7] and in many cases, vector biodiversity further adds to the complexity of the transmission system [8] . Emblematic examples include malaria in Africa [9] where both the parasite and its mosquito vector species have now developed high levels of resistance to the most widely used drugs and insecticides, further jeopardizing control as well as elimination efforts [10, 11] . Yellow fever is another frustrating example where the pathogen remains endemic in many countries [12] despite the availability of an easily deliverable (lyophilized) and affordable vaccine [13] and because of uncontrolled sylvatic transmission cycles [14] allowing virus maintenance In turn, the current eradication campaign against poliomyelitis illustrates a tradeoff between limited available economic resources and their allocation to solve the myriad of problems that conflict or post-conflict countries have to confront without functioning governance and public administrations [15] . Moreover, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, although funding for polio eradication might not be an issue owing to substantial input from international and non governmental agencies, societal concerns about vaccination as well as the circulation of vaccine-derived polio viruses may represent the biggest roadblocks to successful eradication [16, 17] . Last but not least, the HIV pandemic, as well, still defies efficient control because 80% of the infected individuals live in countries where current antiretroviral therapies remain prohibitively expensive [18] .",

Today, it is largely accepted that an alteration of the niche of a species (i.e., its position relative to available resources and competitors present in the environment) is an efficient driver to extinction if the species cannot evolve fast enough to fill another niche or to adapt to the altered one (e.g., 82% of endangered bird species are weakened by niche alteration, especially habitat loss [26] ). From this perspective, recent advances in ecology and evolutionary biology of pathogens [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] provide unprecedented opportunities to build on a new paradigm in the way pathogen control is being devised and implemented. By promoting research for manipulation of pathogens niche as an efficient and effective means for their control, we advocate the application, in public health, of the opposed methodologies usually envisioned to rescue endangered species in order to reach the opposite target of conservation biology, i.e., the extinction (or eradication as it is often referred to in epidemiology). Then, we call for integrating disease control within a broader perspective, focusing on the reverse conservation biology of pathogens.",

From a very general point, we can define the niche of an organism as the position of this organism within its environment, available resources and competitors. Then, it is characterized by all the conditions required to sustain a viable population of the organism, in space and time. For instance, the \"fundamental\" niche of African lions contains grasslands and savannah prairies (their habitats) as well as wildebeest and zebras (their resources). However, African lions \"share\" their habitats and their resources with other predators such as hyenas or wild dogs, yielding a \"realized\" niche that is the \"fundamental\" one constrained by the presence of competitors.",

It is also the case for HIV that depresses the whole host immune system therefore fostering the development of opportunistic infections, especially to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) where individuals infected by HIV are 20 to 30 times more likely to develop an infection [41] , a phenomenon enhanced by a higher fatality rate during treatment of co-infected patients.

Thus, this decrease in the susceptible population can be organized more efficiently, by considering pathogen's dynamics, i.e. its natural fluctuation in space and time ( Figure 2 ), opening opportunities to widen the impact of preventive strategies while facilitating their implementation through targeted actions in space and time.

Indeed, with a given financial resource, it may be more efficient to dedicate a proportion of this money to one control measure, e.g., targeted vaccination, and the rest into another control measure, such as vector control, rather than 100% in either of the two. This clearly calls for theoretical studies that will inform on the expected outcomes of the different control methods, used alone and in combination, as well as foster the development of a modeling framework to identify the most suitable strategies admixtures that will allow optimal efficiency in terms of prevention and mitigation of infections.

Similarly, maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacterial Wolbachia infections were shown to directly reduce the susceptibility of insects to infection with a range of insect and human pathogens [55] , above and beyond their impact on vector's life history traits relevant to vector capacity and transmission (e.g., blood feeding frequency, longevity, fecundity\u2026). Niche alteration can also result from a temporary mismatch between pathogens and hosts abundance. Many pathogens reproduce at a given period of time when resources are abundant and of good quality. It is known, for instance, that apparent competition can take place between two pathogens because one removes susceptible hosts to the other one, such as in the case of measles and whooping-cough [56] .

First, as highlighted above for measles [60] or polio [15] , the majority of the current strategies that mainly focus on one dimension of the pathogen niche require highly effective and fast-acting control tools, and a high coverage of target groups/populations. This could be unrealistic is some settings (see above). In this context, the ecological theory suggests the importance of multiplying targets, rather than increasing selective pressure on a single mechanism, in order to circumvent the apparition of resistances. As an example, Dengue control mainly focuses on vector control while other strategies, such as the use of Wolbachia that constrain virus development in its mosquito vector or the currently-tested vaccine are emerging and should prompt a new approach to dengue control programs in a near future. For diseases where vaccine is the only control possibility, an immunization strategy finely-tuned to the pathogen spatio-temporal dynamics could still improve significantly its effectiveness. First attempts considering only temporal dimension have already shown the potential of such approach [61] and should be extended to the spatial dimension, by focusing on disease (or transmission) hotspots.",

            "text": "Second, for the current control strategies that already focus on several targets within the pathogen's niche, for which the trachoma control program SAFE represents an excellent example, a major insight from the pathogen's niche approach is the importance of considering the temporal and spatial dimensions. Indeed, the necessity to include spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens to understand local transmission, as well as efficiency of control programs, has been extensively demonstrated [62, 63] . As previously exposed, the pathogen niche moves in space and time. This implies that a period of time exists where control could be most efficient, which generally precedes the observation of optimal conditions for pathogen transmission. As an example, if vector abundance presents a seasonal pattern, it could be more efficient to enforce vector control strategies when abundance is low as vector populations might then be more amenable to control in otherwise adverse environmental conditions. Finally, ecological theory tells us that the evolutionary dimension is also crucial to consider. The sequential usage of different antibiotics (for trachoma) or insecticides/ larvicides (for dengue vectors) with different modes of action for example, is an efficient way to reduce the risk of emergence of resistance, and to mitigate its spread, therefore promoting sustainability. The concept of Late-Life-Acting insecticides i.e., compounds or organisms that slowly kill the arthropod vector such that it dies after reproduction but before it is able to transmit the pathogen also directly stems from ecological and evolutionary biology theory, and appears as a promising tool for sustainable transmission control [64] .",

Failures in implementation or incorrect planning might result in pathogen escape and niche shift with unforeseen consequences for human health and the environment. The second challenge therefore resides in the ability of public health managers to act fast and implement several control strategies together locally, within a short time-frame, but also to repeat such actions during several years in order to ensure an efficient pathogen control over the long-term. From the point of view of economic resources, the costs can be decreased quite significantly (lower level of drug use, less storage, shortening the necessity of cold chain,\u2026), but the logistics and organization could be more complex to sort out.",

Public health strategies are generally conditioned by an economic constraint in low-income countries whereas they target maximal burden alleviation for high-income countries.
