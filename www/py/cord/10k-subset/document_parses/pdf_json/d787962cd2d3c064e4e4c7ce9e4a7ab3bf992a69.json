According to World Bank estimates, increase in life expectancy and the reduction in fertility have been bigger in the last 40 years than the preceding 4,000 years (1) . The majority of these improvements were caused not by advancements in clinical medicine, but because of improved public health and prevention activities. Almost all countries have undergone the ''epidemiologic transition'' representing rising life expectancy with the epidemic emergence of non-communicable disease (NCDs). Developing countries are under a doubled edge sword with NCDs emerging at the same time old and new infectious diseases are still rampant. Most certainly, there are enormous disparities across the world, but the vast majority of us today are healthier than our parents' generation.",

We have also been providing ''Just in Time'' or JIT lectures, which covered hot topics like tsunami, earthquakes, hurricanes, avian flu, SARS, etc. (1, 2) . Those lectures were unveiled within several days following each disaster or outbreak. Supercourse lectures cover wide variety of topics within public health, including epidemiology, research methods, public health policy, statistics, global health, women's health, etc. We have the very simple concept that if we can provide excellent template lectures that can be used in PowerPoint worldwide, we can improve the quality of teaching both in the developing and developed world. Our goal is to provide the best PowerPoint lectures and slides on prevention, so that health could be improved in the long run. The author of the lectures does not teach the students directly from the Internet, he or she can download and modify the lectures, based on the needs of the audience. We encourage submission of lectures in multiple languages. Over 200 lectures in the Supercourse are available in Spanish, Russian, and other languages.",

We believe that the individual educators in around the world and especially in the developing countries need to shape their own courses or programs, as they need to customize the program of study based upon local needs. We define an ''educator'' very broadly. An educator can be a university professor, community educator, village elder, or schoolteacher. Supercourse is not a substitute for existing educational model, but a teaching-support system. We provide high-level lectures to the teachers of students in medical, dental, nursing schools, schools of public health, etc. These are high-quality lectures by experts in the field, and the teacher just ''takes'' them out like a library book to teach. Unlike in the distance education model, we are not replacing the local teacher. The Supercourse empowers the local teachers by providing him or her with better teaching tools. Statistical quality control system, similar to that developed by Deming for the Industry, is utilized to monitor the quality of the Supercourse lectures. We are working on opening new directions for quality control for the information on the Internet (3).",

In 2000 (3) and 2003 (4), resolutions were passed, specifying the changes needed for success in tobacco control and urging the WHO member states to support a strong and effective Convention. In 2001, the WFPHA organized a workshop at WHO Headquarters (5), where the tobacco control activities of its member associations were examined and discussed. This provided also an occasion for a personal contact with the Chair of the Negotiating Body. A second opportunity was 2 weeks before the final negotiating session in 2003, when the then President of the WFPHA met personally with the Chair for more than an hour to convince him that no formal rule existed which would demand a consensus on the Convention text, and that he should bring critical issues to a vote, respecting the fact that except for a few governments with close relations to the tobacco industry, there was practically complete unanimity in favor of a strong FCTC. The same message was again presented by the WFPHA in an intervention at the opening of the negotiating session. At the end, the opposition faded. Most of the important elements of the Convention were passed by consensus and the final version of the FCTC reached unanimous approval.",

Given their credibility and prestige, health-care professionals should take a leading role in this effort. And they should become better aware of the negative and often dishonest role of the tobacco industry, so that they can give up blaming the smokers for their behavior and participate in empowering society (including smokers) in fighting off tobacco industry seductions.

All social inequalities in access to health care 1 should be eliminated. Further research to understand better the ''causes of the causes'' of disease and the social determinants of health, and assess policy and interventions is needed. The results of research should be publicly available and taken into account in the formulation of public policy and health interventions; those, in turn, should have health promotion as an integral part of their design. Stronger inter-sectoral links between health and other public policies and effective links with governmental non-governmental and civil society initiatives are needed. The public health workforce has to be developed and strengthened.",
