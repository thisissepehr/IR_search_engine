The first case infected with H7N9 virus in Beijing involved a family member of a chicken dealer and was reported in April 2013. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of this case and her parents were examined to illustrate some key traits regarding this novel H7N9 virus. Methods The index case was subjected to intensive clinical examination in order to observed the clinical process. Realtime PCR was used to confirm cases infected with H7N9 virus. The index case was administered oseltamivir (45 mg, twice daily) at the early stage of the infection. Sera were collected from the index case and her parents from the onset of illness onwards. The subjects were followed for 4 weeks.",

Influenza A H7N9 is a triple reassortant virus [1] . In contrast to the common clinical features of patients infected with other H7 subtype viruses, those infected with H7N9 rapidly develop lower respiratory tract illness [2] [3] [4] [5] . In many cases of H7N9 influenza, the health status of the patients can rapidly deteriorate into severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, ultimately progressing to death. The spectrum of H7N9 infections remains unclear as epidemiological data are still limited. Prior 30 May 2013, 132 cases had been diagnosed worldwide, with a casefatality rate (CFR) of up to 28.03 % (37/132) [6] . An efficient treatment strategy to reduce the CFR is therefore urgently sought in China.",
