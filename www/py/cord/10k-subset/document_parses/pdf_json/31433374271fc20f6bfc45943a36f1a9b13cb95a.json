Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design ,i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "infection transmission and control, risk assessment, air change rate (ACH), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), patient room, ventilation system design Article History", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The role that airborne transmission plays in nosocomial or hospital acquired infections (NI/HAI) has been highly debated for well over 40 years. Although transmission of nosocomial pathogens from people via an airborne route in the hospital setting is well established, it is a common misconception that most hospital acquired infections (HAI) are spread by aerosol transmission and that the number of air changes per hour (ACH) used to ventilate the occupied space directly impacts the transmission. Many studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles suggest that ventilation is one of the major methods for reduction and control of the spread of pathogens via the airborne route in hospitals (Streifel 1999; Kaushal et al. 2004; Beggs et al. 2008) . ASHRAE 170 2008 and the CDC guidelines 2005 recommend ventilation rates of minimum 12 ACH for hospital insulation rooms. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Li et al. (2005 Li et al. ( , 2007 discuss the role that ventilation systems play in cross infection between people. They conclude that there is a close connection between the ventilation systems and the infectious transmission in the air. Recently, engineers have begun to examine the effect that physical factors such as location of supply and exhaust vents, surfaces, object placement and composition and thermodynamic factors such as temperature, humidity and air currents have on aerosol transmission and particle migration. For health care facilities, the studies specifically examine infectious particle transmission. However, these studies rarely take into account length of exposure time and particle virulence. Furthermore, an extensive literature review (Memarzadeh 2011a) indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. Individual risk factors exist that make one person more vulnerable to contracting a disease than another. Risk factors for HAIs are factors that are not a direct cause of the disease, but appear to be associated in some way with infection. Risk factors may be inherent in an individual due to genetics, health status, or gender. Risk factors may also be present in the local environment. Examples of environmental risk factors include the age and operational status of the ventilation equipment, temperature and humidity. Risk factors are also related to behaviors such as compliance to use of standard operating procedures (SOP) involving personal protective equipment (PPE), decontamination or control of isolation procedures for example. Although the existence of a risk factor for an HAI increases the chances of contracting an illness, it does not always lead to a HAI, whereas the absence of any single risk factor or the existence of a protective factor, does not necessarily guard against getting a HAI (Memarzadeh 2011b) . Fisk (2000) estimates that changes in building characteristics and ventilation could reduce indices of respiratory illness by 15% to 76%. The estimated productivity gains by reducing respiratory illness, utilizing 1996 data are 16 to 37 million avoided cases of common cold or influenza, with a potential of $6 to $14 billion in 1996 dollars (Fisk 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 708, "end": 723, "text": "(Streifel 1999;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 724, "end": 744, "text": "Kaushal et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 745, "end": 763, "text": "Beggs et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1070, "text": "Li et al.

Based largely on data available from the National Nosocomial Infections Study (NNIS), he estimated that airborne transmission accounted for 10% to 20% of all endemic nosocomial infections or about a one percent incidence of infection among hospitalized patients. Maki et al. (1982) did extensive environmental microbiological sampling of a new university hospital in Madison, Wisconsin before and after it was put into use. The rate of nosocomial infections in the new hospital was no different from the rate in the old hospital, thus suggesting that organisms in the inanimate environment contributed little if at all to endemic nosocomial infections. Schaal (1991) estimated that the relative incidence of airborne infections is about 10% of the whole of endemic nosocomial infection. However, Kowalski (2007) estimated that more than a third of all nosocomial infections possibly involve airborne transmission at some point. He stated that \"various sources estimate that between 2 million and 4 million nosocomial infections occur annually, resulting in 20 000 to 80 000 fatalities.\" The increase from 10% to 33% or greater may be indicative of the identification of new pathogenic microorganisms such as SARS CoV and other mutated forms of influenza virus.

Figure 9 compares the exposure concentration in the first volume, which is right above the patient. Figure 9 (a) suggests that in a \"poor\" ventilation design that does not conform to the \"path\" principle, increasing airflow rate from 4 ACH to 12 ACH has little impact on the infection risk. In contrast, Fig. 9 (b) indicates that with an \"optimized\" ventilation design that conforms to the \"path\" principle, increasing the airflow rate does reduce the infection risk. This observation of the impact of ventilation flow rate and infection risk is consistent with recent experimental studies Olmedo et al. 2011) , which also found increasing airflow rates to 12 ACH does not necessarily reduce the infection risk in a mixing ventilation setting. Further, several studies (Edwards et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2006; Sun and Ji 2007; Gupta et al. 2009 ) indicate that the interaction of coughed flow with high initial velocity ranging from 6 m/s (1181.1 fpm) up to 30 m/s (5905.51 fpm) with the free convection flow around the human body and the ventilation flow will be different than the flow of exhalation with much low initial velocity (Gupta et al. 2010) . This suggests that the strategy of supplying extra amounts of outdoor air aiming to dilute the polluted room air may not be effective in protecting from airborne cross-infection due to coughing. Figure 10 compares the rest of the volumes that were examined in this study. This data reveals a more complex nature of infection risk. First, consistent with Figs. 9, 10 suggests that an optimized ventilation design provides significant reduction of contaminant in most scenarios. Second, also consistent with Fig. 9 , it appears that increasing the supply airflow rate does not reduce the risk with a poor design. With the optimized design, it appears that increased airflow rate does help at later time (>150 s), but at earlier time points, airflow rate can have the opposite effect, especially when considering the distance 1' away from the source. This may suggest that if the caregiver is too close to the patient, the ventilation system plays a secondary role in terms of preventing exposure to infectious particles. Third, as would be expected, the data suggests that in most cases moving away from the patient does help to reduce exposure. However, note that the benefit of keeping a distance from the patient can be offset by poor ventilation design, and under the low airflow rate of 4 ACH, moving away from the patient is not an effective way to reduce the risk regardless of the design.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 953, "end": 972, "text": "Olmedo et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1153, "text": "(Edwards et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1170, "text": "Zhu et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1187, "text": "Sun and Ji 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1205, "text": "Gupta et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1513, "text": "(Gupta et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 310, "end": 318, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 363, "end": 371, "text": "Figure 9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 463, "end": 471, "text": "Figure 9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 667, "end": 673, "text": "Fig. 9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1720, "text": "Figure 10", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2028, "text": "Fig. 9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussions"}, {"text": "In summary, the results of this numerical study confirm previous empirical studies Olmedo et al. ) and define a \"path\" theory between \"Source\" and \"Exhaust\" of contaminants.
