Radix Ginseng (RG), a traditional herb used as herbal remedy in eastern Asia for thousands of years, which has been traditionally used in China to improve blood circulation and ameliorate pathological hemostasis. This study investigated whether Ginsenoside Rb1, the main components of RG, can attenuate ALI induced by LPS. Methods: In vivo, 30 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n = 10 each groups) on the basis of the reagent used, which were subjected to LPS injection with or without Ginsenoside Rb1 (5 mg/kg) treatments to induce ALI model. Lung injury was assessed by pulmonary histology, lung wet-weight to dry-weight (W/D) ratio, the number of myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells, immunohistochemical analysis of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), gene expression of ICAM-1, ultrastructure changes of pulmonary microvasculature, concentration of inflammatory markers and in plasma. In vitro, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were stimulated with LPS in the presence and absence of Ginsenoside Rb1 (50 mM), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 was measured by immunocytochemistry staining and western blotting. Results: Infusion of LPS induced lung injury, in vivo, as demonstrated by pulmonary edema with infiltration of neutrophils and hemorrhage, the increase in lung W/D ratio, the number of MPO positive cells, the level of inflammatory markers such as TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-8, enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and ICAM-1 gene. Moreover, resulted in the changes of intercellular junctions in the endothelial cells of pulmonary microvasculature. In vitro, the significant increased release of NF-\u03baB p65 and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus in PMVECs were observed. In contrast, Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced lung injury, as judged by the marked improvement in all these indices.",

A recent epidemiological study indicate that ALI leads to 75,000 deaths annually in the United States [1] . Respiratory failure is caused by an excessive inflammatory response to both pulmonary and extrapulmonary stimuli, including pneumonia, acid aspiration, ischemia-reperfusion and sepsis [2] . Inflammatory mediators can disrupt the pulmonary capillary barrier, leading to the influx of a proteinrich edema with severe consequences for gas exchange and the functional integrity of remote organ systems [3] . Excessive infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) into the lungs has been identified as a pivotal event in the early development of ALI.",

Recently, it was reported that there are some active compounds in RG which could scavenge radical, inhibit the leukocytes adhesion to venular wall or protect lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microcirculatory injury. As so far, among 26 identified ginsenosides, Ginsenoside-Rb1, \u2212Ro, \u2212Rg1, \u2212Rc, and -Re are highly abundant. In particular, Ginsenoside Rb1 makes up 0.37-0.5% of ginseng extracts [5] . Cell culture studies have shown that Ginsenoside Rb1 can inhibit LPS-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. We previously identified that Ginsenoside Rb1, which is isolated from Notoginseng and Ginseng in Chinese herbal medicine efficiently can attenuate LPSinduced intestinal injury by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation [6] . However, the effect of Ginsenoside Rb1 on lung microcirculatory injury has not been reported thus far.",

Briefly, Wistar rats were maintained under specific pathogen-free and controlled light conditions (22\u00b0C, 55% humidity, and 12-hour day/night rhythm). After animals were died, the thoracic cavity was opened and the lung was exposed fully, lung tissue was cut from peripheral parts of the lung, pasted in culture flasks and cultured in DMEM with 20% FBS, 50 lg/ml ECGS. Behind cells emigrated from the pasting tissue and were grown to confluence, cells were purified by different speed adherence method. The cell morphology was observed in inverted optical microscope. Primary rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . Experimental data were obtained from cells in their third to fifth generation. The immunocytochemical staining of factor VIII-related antigen was to performed to identify the PMVECs. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. After rehydrating with 5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were exposed to rabbit anti-factor VIII-related antigen. On washing 3 times with PBS, they were exposed to goat anti-rabbit IgG. The cells were then stained with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine and the negative control group received only the secondary antibody [14] . The cells were analyzed and identified under inverted microscope. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Capital Medical University. All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.",

The results in the present study demonstrated that Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly attenuated the LPS-induced lung injury, as shown by the lesser tissue injury compared with that observed in the LPS animals, the W/D ratio, the expression of ICAM-1 along the vascular endothelium, the mRNA level of ICAM-1, inflammatory factors, and NF-\u03baB p65 expression in the lung. These results suggest that, Ginsenoside Rb1 may protect the lung from LPSinduced tissue injury.",

Meanwhile, LPS is known to cause pulmonary inflammation in association with neutrophil sequestration in the pulmonary microvasculature, followed by adhesion and activation [28, 29] . We therefore studied the effects of Ginsenoside Rb1 on expression of the adhesion molecule required for neutrophil recruitment in lung tissue. Expression of ICAM-1, which is an important adhesion molecule for neutrophil activation, markedly increased in the vascular endothelium after LPS infusion [30] . The sepsis-associated organ injury is further complicated by the implication of overproduction of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-8, which are believed to be pro-inflammatory factors, are produced by activated monocyte/macrophages, and acts mainly to attract neutrophils and monocytes [31] . These chemokines are all associated with the influx, accumulation and activation of highly destructive cells involved in Figure 7 The effect of Ginsenoside Rb1 on the activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in PMVECs. A. Representative images for the effect of Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment on activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in PMVECs. B. Representative images of Western Blotting for the effect of Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment on activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in PMVECs. C. Effect of Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment on expression of NF-\u03baB p65 in PMVECs. Con: Control group; LPS: LPS group; LPS + Rb1: LPS plus Ginsenoside Rb1 group. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E of 10 animals. * P < 0.05 vs. Con group, # P < 0.05 vs. LPS group. local inflammatory processes. As Wang has reported Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced excessive accumulation of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood [32] . We have acquired the similar outcomes in this study, Ginsenoside Rb1 alleviated remarkably the overproduction of inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-8). In contrast, Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment significantly attenuated the expression of these proinflammatory molecules compared with LPS infusion alone. Thus, these findings suggest that Ginsenoside Rb1 possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties, and hence is able to suppress LPS-induced pulmonary tissue inflammation and injury. In line with these findings, the result of electron microscopy in the present study showed the gap of intercellular junctions apparently increased at 60 min after LPS infusion, whereas the endothelial cells themselves remained intact with Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment, implying that LPS-induced plasma leakage observed in the present situation was mainly inhibited by Ginsenoside Rb1.",
