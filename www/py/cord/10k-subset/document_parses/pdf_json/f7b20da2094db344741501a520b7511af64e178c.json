It is important to be acquainted with new causes of infection which include Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, diphtheroids in certain instances (Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum), and viruses such as the Hanta strains. Infections with Bordetella pertussis are increasing. However, the ever present and most common cause of CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae, continues to present problems because of increasing antibiotic resistance, the high case fatality rate when bacteremia accompanies pneumonia, and the inability to give prophylactic immunization to all people with risk factors for this infection.",

Pneumonia occurs frequently, but the attack rate varies greatly by age, from associated comorbid conditions and among people with different ethnic and sociologic backgrounds. CAP has witnessed new developments that will be the focus of this review: (1) frequency with which an actual microbial diagnosis is established; (2) recent guidelines to help with initiating empirical treatment based on the probable presence of pathogens; and (3) new causative microbes. Not all of these latter organisms are associated with pneumonia but do cause respiratory infection.",

When three series of patients with CAP that required hospitalization [10, 24, 55] were tabulated and nicely compared by Marrie (see Table 4 in Ref. 54) according to microbial causes, the number (percentage) of patients in whom the etiology of pneumonia remained unknown was 33% [24] , 47% [55] , and approximately 49% [10] . To elaborate from one study [10] that conscientiously sought the etiologic organism(s) in acute pneumonia, this was only established in approximately 50% of cases. For 198 patients with 204 episodes of pneumonia investigated and given followup at the McClellan Memorial Veterans Medical Center (Little Rock, Arkansas), a specific agent was found or attributed in 103 episodes; for 154 episodes of CAP, a diagnosis was made in 79 cases (51%) and in 24 of 50 patients (48%) with hospitalacquired pneumonia. Because these patients had complete and long term follow-up, some diagnoses were substantiated by serial serologic titers, an approach not always possible. Most patients (>90%) had an important coexistent disease process, such as malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart failure [10] , which would be expected in an elderly patient group (mean age 64 years) of military veterans.",

This is a summary statement from a distinguished panel that evaluated current epidemiology and trends in therapy and had a realistic appreciation of evolving health care practices. Therefore, these recommendations, endorsed as an official statement by the American Thoracic Society, for the initial management of CAP are important and merit a careful in-depth review [72] .

Most commonly the microbes will be Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Legionella species (L. pneumophila most likely), Chlamydia pneumoniae, and perhaps Staphylococcus aureus. This spectrum might change, if the patient has COPD/ bronchitis, to enhance the probability of S. pneumoniae or Hemophilus sp. infection even more but also would make inclusion of Moraxella catarrhalis and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum (as will be discussed later) necessary. If the patient is older and/or frail and debilitated, Gram-negative enteric pathogens may more likely be involved. The spectrum of microbes and the dynamics of their colonization of the respiratory tract are fascinating and complex and an interesting topic of its own [51, 71, 80] .",

Aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions that can introduce anaerobic flora is a concern as well. Current epidemiologic information about infections in the local community, the immunization status of the patient (prior influenza and pneumococcal vaccine prophylaxis), and recent antibiotic usage are important. Any of these conditions might change a microbe from a \"usual pathogen\" to a more invasive and opportunistic one, making hospitalization necessary because of the need for parenteral antibiotics and monitoring of renal function. If, however, infection with a usual pathogen is probable, oral administration of a macrolide or of a secondgeneration cephalosporin (cefuroxime) is usually sufficient [72] in the absence of the extenuating factors just discussed. Thereafter, the patient's response to therapy over the next 2-to 3-day interval will dictate how to proceed. If there is a good response, the treatment is continued through completion, usually a 10-day antibiotic course, ff not, a poor patient response may require a change or an addition of another antibiotic, or hospitalization could be deemed necessary to give additional supportive care, supplemental oxygen, or more intensive respiratory therapy.",

Hopefully, stringent cost considerations in managed care practice will not dictate this situation, for finding coexisting conditions, aptly mentioned by the committee [72] , can be helpful, such as a pleural effusion or mass lesion causing bronchial obstruction. The other tests deemphasized are Gram stain analysis of sputum and routine aerobic bacterial cultures because sensitivity and specificity are low, and concordance between the Gram stain and subsequent culture results, S. pneumoniae for example, is poor. The futility of this analysis was supported in the Bates et al. [10] report, wherein viewing a single organism on the Gram stain of a good, suitable sputum specimen was correlated with the correct pathogen in only a very few cases. The usefulness of these tests is discussed in depth by Bartlett and Mundy [9] . Moreover, invasive procedures to obtain lower airway specimens not contaminated by oropharyngeal flora, such as bronchoscopy with a protected brush catheter, are not indicated for most patients with CAP; an exception of course is the seriously ill patient. Blood cultures are recommended for a hospitalized patient with CAP. However, if circumstances permit in a clinic or medical office setting, two blood cultures might be a good investment; since pneumococcal pneumonia is such a common cause of CAP, blood cultures can be positive in 20-30% of cases, and the case fatality rate is still appreciable. Admittedly, outpatient-obtained blood cultures present issues of quality control and require appropriate handling of the specimens for optimal recovery of microbes, but the yield can be helpful and high.",

As the recommendations will not satisfy every situation, their applicability, as discussed by Fein and Niederman [26] , needs to be critiqued as new information is obtained or personal physician usage of them dictates. In addition, for the future, new techniques must be perfected which more rapidly detect the organisms or their products known to cause infection and identify the still unrecognized or additional infectious agents, as postulated by Bates and colleagues [10] , which may account for some of the other 50% cases of CAP that do not yet yield a diagnosis using the best conventional methods to date. For example, the measurement of plasma cytokines [77] has the potential to gauge the host's response to infection and help with better determining how ill the patient is.",

Mandell [52] cites several studies that report an incidence rate varying from 8 to 46%, and he makes the point that this variation may reflect prior taking of antibiotics, obtaining appropriate sputum specimens, or use of specific antigen testing. Based on clinical responsiveness to penicillin therapy, it is likely that other cases considered to be of unknown microbial cause are in reality from S. pneumoniae [54] . This bacterium is often part of the usual microbial flora of the nasooropharynx of normals [51] but also seems to have a predilection for the airway mucosal surfaces of subjects with chronic lung diseases (as do Hemophilus species) [80] . Pneumococci can be aspirated in oropharyngeal secretions into the lower airways, whereupon they can attach to alveolar type II cells that create part of the epithelial lining surface of the alveolar spaces [98] . From a position on the surface of type II pneumocytes, the pneumococcal inoculum may either (1) be coated by nonimmune and/or immune opsonins present in the alveolar epithelial lining fluid and then phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes which can intracellularly kill and remove them; or (2) microbial multiplication occurs, whereupon the pneumococcal capsule and cell wall components can stimulate local cytokines that alter permeability through or around alveolar type I epithelial cells, allowing (serum) fluid to enter the alveolar space. This provides a source of nutrients to sustain proliferation. Thereafter, the battle between host defenses and bacteria [13] ensues with the classical evolution of stages of lung consolidation occurring. The process has been updated nicely with new pathogenic insights and the array of cellular mediators [98] .",

Invasive pneumococcal pneumonia with bacteremia has an attendant mortality in the 20% range; this is still surprising and difficult to accept, but deaths from this illness are not uncommon. Moreover, this basic fatality rate has not been reduced significantly in the past 30-year interval that has witnessed marvelous improvements in health care including many, many new antibiotics. Drs. Austrian and Gold [7] reported for 455 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia that 89 deaths resulted or 19.5% fatal cases (from Table 1 in Ref. 7) . For infection with serotype III, 18/35 (51%) patients died. They found [7] that the incidence of bacteremia was 529 in 2,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia (26.5%). Since then at least a dozen other published articles have reported case fatality rates for bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia ranging from 21 to 41%. A recent report by (3rtqvist et al.

Pneumococcus with increased resistance to penicillin was isolated about 25 years ago [42] ; other isolates from many parts of the world have been found with penicillin resistance [5, 28, 46] . The precise percentage of pneumococcal strains exhibiting penicillin resistance is difficult to compare among institutions and must be determined for each medical center, according to Dr. Appelbaum, 1 who was one of the first to recognize this resistance [6] . For example, at the Pennsylvania State University's Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, he found that about 5-6% of isolates recovered from blood and body fluids show resistance. Most of these isolates are from pediatric age patients.

For prevention, the use of pneumococcal cell vaccines date to the early years of this century. In the 1930-1940s vaccines containing pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigens were found to convey protection; moreover, the development of antibiotic resistance plus continuing mortality from bacteremic infection renewed interest in this form of therapy [6] . The polyvalent 14 serotype vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1977 and recommendations for its use given [2] . In 1983 the original vaccine was replaced by a vaccine containing capsular polysaccharides of 23 serotypes that would account for approximately 90% of bacteremic infections [92] .",

Several critical studies have analyzed the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of the vaccine [representative reports 12, 14, 31, 90, 92, 100] , and all reports found it to have clinical utility. As an example [31], among 762 vaccine recipient patients (data from Minnesota Blue Cross and Blue Shield Insurance Plan), the risk of pneumonia was reduced after vaccination by about one third, or the vaccine provided an overall efficacy of 69%. This varied from 50 to 75% among various risk categories, and the vaccine was more effective in women than men [31] . The total cost of vaccination was about $18.50 per person [31]. Butler and colleagues [14] , analyzing results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Pneumococcal Surveillance Study (14 years in progress), found that overall efficacy was 57% for preventing infection caused by serotypes included in the pneumococcal vaccine, although this beneficial effect was not as good for certain patients with alcoholism or cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, hematologic malignancies, and chronic renal failure. For immunocompetent persons over the age of 65 years, efficacy was 70% [14] . Uniform efficacy has not always been found, however, for some higher risk subjects [93] . Thus, the vaccine does provide more protection in younger, immunocompetent subjects, but it is effective, albeit less so, in older people with associated illness.",

It is incumbent upon medical practitioners to insist that our patients receive this vaccine, if indicated. In a similar vein, evidence supports that influenza vaccination reduces the risk of clinical influenza in the elderly or other persons with indications to receive it.

If vaccination to induce antibody is beneficial in preventing or improving the outcome from the illness, then passive immunity in the form of IgG antibodies [84] should have a role. Certainly, the continued high case fatality rate from bacteremic disease begs for new or more aggressive therapeutic approaches. Commercially available immunoglobulin preparations, assayed by Hamill and colleagues [40] , were found to contain IgG-reactive specific antibody against several common serotypes of S. pneumoniae (serotypes 3, 4, 8, 14 , and 19 F); the titers were variable, however, among the four commercially available IVIG products compared [40] . This antibody was a likely result of a humoral immune response among certain globulin donors who had experienced prior pneumococcal infection, or possibly some donors were vaccinated. This human antipneumococcal antibody was found also to be protective in a mouse infection assay [40] . As drugresistant organisms increase, and S. pneumoniae is a pertinent example of emerging penicillin resistance, many health care scientists warn that we are entering a postantibiotic era, thus antibody-based therapies may reemerge [17] .",

Moreover, a flu-like, nonpneumonic respiratory illness (Pontiac fever) was part of the spectrum as well [33] , and had occurred in 1968. Soon, other species of Legionella were identified; the Pittsburgh pneumonia agent [65] later became Legionella micdadei [25] . Recently, a review by Skerrett [94] indicated that 40 species of the genus Legionella have been identified and more than 50 serotypes found. About half of these have been associated with pneumonia, but L. pneumophila still accounts for the majority of infections (80%). Two reviews [22, 85] comprehensively cover all of the features of these small aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and the infections caused.",

LegioneIla is estimated to cause 1-15% of the cases of CAP, but its prevalence has seemed to vary geographically [22] and among neighboring medical centers. For the three series of CAP requiring hospitalization, tabulated and contrasted for etiology by Dr. Marrie [ Table 4 in Ref. 54] Legionella species accounted for 6.7% [24] , 2.2% [55] , and 9% [10] of CAP cases. Legionella sp. have been isolated infrequently by special cultures from patient specimens at our medical center in Hershey, Pennsylvania. In fact, only one positive culture has been obtained in the past 2 years, despite about 10-12 sputum or respiratory specimens being evaluated per month, z However, about 60 miles away in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, near the Pennsylvania-Maryland state border, the community's hospital was the center of a publicized epidemic this past summer [ 18, 47] . At least 35 cases of Legionella infection occurred in July 1995 among personnel who were exposed to an aerosol generated by an external water source. Experiencing a nearby epidemic heightened awareness of this infection in our general area.",

The usual circumstances or environmental conditions reported [59] involve a warm water reservoir, perhaps suboptimal concentrations of chlorine as a disinfectant, concomitant growth of other organisms (algae) providing nutrients, and an aerosol or droplet-generating mechanism. Presumably, direct droplet inhalation or microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions containing the organisms is the route that inoculates the lung. Transmission of Legionella causing sporadic cases of nosocomial pneumonia may occur in obscure ways, humdifiers or rinsing ventilatory equipment with tap water, as was demonstrated experimentally [102] . Although there are many unsuspecting ways this bacterium might be presented to a patient, person-to-person transmission does not occur [85] . Epidemic occurrences may have similarities in clinical presentation, and sporadic cases can occur year round, especially in immunocompromised and organ transplant recipient patients. This possibility may not be entertained in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia. Recent reviews [22, 85] of this infection continue to stress that no constellation of patient symptoms, signs, or screening laboratory tests is sufficiently pathognomonic or reliably distinct to permit a confident clinical diagnosis of Legionella infection.",

(BranhameIla) catarrhalis, considered to be a harmless part of the nasopharyngeal flora, could be a lower tract pathogen is rather recent [70] .",

The last is associated with sinusitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia and is now implicated in approximately 10% of outpatient and inpatient cases of pneumonia. The discovery and much of the substantive clinical research performed with this organism have been done by Grayston and colleagues in Seattle [36] [37] [38] . C. pneumoniae is given as the third or fourth most frequent cause of CAP [36] , and indeed it was found as the etiology of 6-8% of CAP cases in the three series we are monitoring, as tabulated by Marrie and referred to previously [54] , ranking it approximately fourth. This newly identified species of Chlamydia is classified as a bacterium, but it only grows intracellularly. As C. pneumoniae can be difficult to grow in culture, identification of its specific DNA, using PCR amplification methods applied to throat swab material or respiratory secretions, has established its role in causing outbreaks of infections [37] . As with other acute respiratory infections, no complex of symptoms or findings is sufficiently characteristic of Chlamydia to permit a clinical diagnosis. Illness attributed to C. pneumoniae TWAR strain can be mild and relatively asymptomatic or can be in the form of bronchitis or pneumonia. However, the infection may be subacute, and recovery can be slow (lasting weeks or months) even with erythromycin or tetracycline treatment [36] .",

Recently, Avni-Shemer and Lieberman [8] , using human ciliated bronchial epithelial cells obtained from nonsmoking adults at bronchoscopy, found that C. pneumoniae infection of cell cultures inhibited ciliary action within 48 h. It is uncertain what caused the ciliostatic effect. For other bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa [87, 91, 101] exotoxins and microbial products have been found to paralyze ciliary motion, perhaps creating the opportunity for microbes to bind to the cilia or adhere directly to the respiratory cell.",

However, this concept may need reevaluation because of two recent reports [1, 53] , especially if diphtheroids are observed to be intracellularly located in PMN lenkocytes in stained smears of good quality specimens of respiratory secretions. Among the 17 patients reported by Manzella and colleagues [53] from York Hospital in York, Pennsylvania, 12 were considered to have bronchitis and five pneumonia; most cases might be considered as a form of community-related infection as only four cases were designated as hospital acquired. Many of these patients were elderly (average age was about 68 years, range 40-93 years), and 14 had an underlying or multiple systemic conditions, such as congestive heart failure (n = 8), COPD (n = 8), cancer, renal failure, or diabetes; three deaths occurred [53] . Of two cases described in detail [53] , one was of a fatal case with autopsy evidence of bilateral, acute bronchopneumonia; tissue staining showed PMN leukocyte inflammation containing diphtheroid-like Gram-positive rods and rare Gram-positive cocci in clusters. However, a culture of the lung specimen was not done. Among the 16 patients reported from Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan [1] , their demographic and underlying conditions were reasonably similar to the other series [53] . Both articles noted that fever was not always present and was found in 16/33 patients from the combined series. Generally, the bacteria were sensitive to a [~-lactam antibiotic or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but could be resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin and borderline sensitive for quinoline antibiotics [1] .",

These were compared with control subjects without respiratory complaints. This study [103] revealed important findings: (1) all but one subject had complete vaccination during childhood; (2) none had a positive culture for B. pertussis, and only in one was a DFA test positive; and (3) 16 subjects (or 21%) had a sufficiently high serologic titer on presentation or a rise found in the convalescent serum sample to qualify for the authors' diagnosis of recent infection. Thus, in adults with persistent cough, about 20% may have evidence of recent B. pertussis infection, certainly a large enough number to make this association one to consider in a differential diagnosis.

The public is becoming accustomed, but undoubtedly is still worried, that killer forms of pneumonia continue to emerge; Legionella was reported only 20 years ago. Capturing the imagination most recently has been the mysterious Ebola virus infection apparently originating from Zaire in Central Africa but capable of spreading quickly or appearing as a subhuman primate infection. This was described in an enthralling book [76] and also presented with a slightly different scenario in a contemporary movie [21] . Prominent periodicals have devoted their covers and published articles depicting deadly microbes and dire consequences [32, 48] . This is all superimposed on the fact that many other infections, heretofore seemingly contained by antibiotics, vaccination, or good hygienic practices, have returned; i.e. tuberculosis, cholera, typhus, and malaria are major concerns again [4] . The postantibiotic infectious era, as discussed [17] , may be looming.",

During the Korean War, 45 years ago, illness with a related virus had been evaluated among United Nations troops, who developed fever, hemorrhagic signs, and acute renal failure. This illness was called Korean hemorrhagic fever. According to Dr. John White, 3 it did not have an obvious respiratory component, and the Hantavirus strain Hantaan, which he and co-workers characterized [99] , was one of several strains in the Bunyaviridae family of RNA viruses which could cause the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The virus infected rodents and was carried by them in the zoonotic phase of the infection. Dr. White said that investigators later were aware of the presence of a related virus in the United States from isolates in urban rats and feral rodents and that a hantavirus, later designated \"Prospect Hill,\" had been isolated in the area near Frederick, Maryland.",

The latter was discovered by serologic titers of Hantavirus antibodies, as reported by Hamory and colleagues [41] . This patient, who recovered, had been hiking along the Appalachian Trail from Georgia northward to Virginia, and he reported evidence of mice, rodent traps, and excreta in various shelters and bunkhouses along the way. This was the first reported case east of the Mississippi River and extended the range of this illness. At the time this report was published [41] , the editorial note accompanying it mentioned that 98 cases had been identified in 21 states. This past spring (May 1995), a second person was reported to have died of HPS in New York state (Suffolk County). In this article [86] , it was cited that nationwide there had been a total of 106 confirmed cases. Thus, the potential for this respiratory infection to occur is widespread and must be considered.",

After a prodromal period of about 3-6 days of fever and myalgias (a flu-like beginning), progressive cough and shortness of breath can initiate a cardiopulmonary phase [15] that can be a prelude to progressive hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure. As there is no specific treatment, general support for ARDS, hypotension, and multiorgan failure is the best that can be offered. As described, mortality is high. Perhaps the most effective strategy is to take precautions not to create dust when in surroundings where rodent fecal matter is evident, as an infected aerosol is the route of lung inoculation. In this respect, Rosenthal [86] passed on helpful tips from New York State Health officials: prevent contact with rodent carcasses by using gloves when removing them from traps; do not stir up dust when cleaning areas containing rodent droppings; do not sweep or vacuum up droppings but douse them with water and bleach before removal.",

Younger, previously healthy persons seem likely to be frequent targets while pursuing outdoor activities given the nature of exposure to rodents and their excreta. Prevention in the form of care when cleaning areas likely to be contaminated with infected droppings is the best defense at present until a specific therapy is developed. It is encouraging [19] that immune animal and patient sera can cause cross-antibody neutralization of several strains of pathogenic Hantaviruses, opening the possibility for development of a vaccine and protective immunity.
