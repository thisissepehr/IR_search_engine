In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1. However the similarity was low for each virus and its host.

Each amino acid is encoded with at least one codon (e.g., Met and Try); however, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, some amino acids are encoded with up to six codons (e.g, Leu, Ser and Arg). Codons encoding the same amino acid are referred to as synonymous codons. Studies have indicated that synonymous codon usage is non-random and species-specific [1] . Some synonymous codons are more frequent than others both within and between genes, and this phenomenon is termed synonymous codon usage bias [2] . In general, genome dynamics, primarily mutation pressure, facilitate the evolution of novel viruses and strains and contribute to adaption to environment and host [3] . Hence, codon usage variation is considered to be an indicator of the type of force that influences genome evolution. Investigation of codon bias and the forces that influence it provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms of viral evolution.

Mean ENC values for H5N1 influenza A virus [47] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [48] and human bocavirus [39] , reported as 50.91, 48.99 and 44.45, respectively, are lower than the ENC values for TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 (56.21 and 56.46, respectively), indicating a relatively low codon usage bias for these two viruses. Codon usage patterns for TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 were remarkably similar. In addition, no significant relationship was found between the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 and its host; although TTSuV1 codon usage was comparatively more similar to swine than that of TTSuV2 (Table 3) . This observation might be the result of genome composition evolution and dynamic processes of mutation and selection that enabled the TTSuV1 virus to escape the antiviral cell responses and adapt its codon usage to its host environment [49] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 283, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 320, "end": 324, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 345, "end": 349, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1070, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 818, "end": 827, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, nucleotide frequency at the third codon position of synonymous codons correlated to general composition for some codons but not for others ( Table 4 ). The GC content was similar at all codon positions in TTSuV2 genomes, presumably as a result of mutational pressure. In addition, the general correlation between codon usage bias and composition constraint suggest that mutational pressure was an important factor determining codon usage in TTSuV2, as seen in the highly significant correlation between GC 1 %, GC 2 % and GC 3 % (p < 0.01), and remarkable correlation between f 1 ' values with respect to A%, G%, C%, GC%, A 3S %, G 3S %, GC 3S % (p<0.01) ( Table 5) . Furthermore, in all ENC plots, values for TTSuV2 genomes were below the expected curve ( Figure 1 ). Taken together, the above evidence indicates that compositional constraint under mutational pressure significantly contributed to the variation of synonymous codon usage in TTSuV2 genomes. Natural selection has been shown to influence the synonymous codon usage pattern in viruses [50] and this conclusions is supported by this study. First, although the GC 3S % for the TTSuV2 genome is lower than average (46.20%), the most frequent codons had A or C at the third codon position (Table 3) . Second, a significant positive correlation existed between G% and C 3S %, and GC% and T 3S % (p < 0.01), whereas no correlation was detected between T% and T 3S % or G% and G 3S % (p > 0.05) ( Table 4 ). Except G 3S %, no correlation was found between f 2 ' values and A%, T%, G%, C%, GC%, A 3S %, T 3S %, C 3S % or GC 3S % (p > 0.05) in this study (Table 5) . Third, most points in the ENC plot were close to the expected curve, although all were below it ( Figure 2 ). The above evidences suggests that, in addition to mutation pressure, natural selection played an important role in determining codon usage bias for TTSuV2 genomes as well. Thus, codon bias in the TTSuV2 genome is multi-factorial. We believe that these characteristics of TTSuV2 genomes might have conferred adaptive advantage resulting in a highly efficient dissemination of this virus through different modes of transmission. The analysis of TTSuV genome sequences identified two genetically distinct species, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. COA was performed to detect possible codon usage variation between these two viruses. Unexpectedly, the distribution of the two viruses showed that genetically distinct species were distantly located in the plane defined by the first two axes of the analysis (Figure 3) . A cluster tree analysis based on the RSCU values of TTSuV2 genomes revealed that geographic factors failed to correspond to the codon usage pattern of this virus (Figure 4) . Further, the phylogenetic tree had two major branches corresponding to the two different species, and no specific geographical correlation was detected in this analysis ( Figure  5 ). It seems likely that, given extensive international communication and various modes of transmission for this virus, geographical distance is a weak factor in the distribution of TTSuV2 in different countries.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1065, "end": 1069, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 163, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 672, "end": 680, "text": "Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 772, "end": 780, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1274, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1477, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1635, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1744, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2547, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2712, "end": 2722, "text": "(Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2896, "end": 2905, "text": "Figure  5", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, our investigation of synonymous codon usage pattern in TTSuV2 CDS revealed that codon usage bias is not remarkable, possibly representing the interactions between compositional constraint under mutation pressure and natural selection.
