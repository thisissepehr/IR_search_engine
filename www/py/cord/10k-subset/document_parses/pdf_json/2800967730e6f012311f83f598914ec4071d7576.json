Since this can be due to infusion of tumour cells contaminating the PBPC grafts, we initiated a feasibility study in which PBPC grafts from HD patients were purged by CD34 + cell enrichment. Controversy exists about whether the use of CD34 + enriched stem cells leads to a delayed haematological and immune reconstitution. We compared these parameters, including risk of infections and clinical outcome after HDT, in patients with HD given either selected CD34 + cells or unmanipulated PBPC as stem cell support. From October 1994 to May 2000, 40 HD patients with primary refractory disease or relapse were treated with HDT and supported with either selected CD34 + cells (n = 21) or unmanipulated PBPC (n = 19) as stem cell support. All patients had chemosensitive disease at the time of transplantation. A median of 5.8 (range 2.7-20.0) vs 4.5 (range 2.3-17.6) \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells per kilo were reinfused in the CD34 + group and PBPC group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups with regard to time to haematological engraftment, reconstitution of B cells, CD56 + cells and T cells at 3 and 12 months and infectious episodes after HDT. Two (5%) treatment-related deaths, one in each group, were observed. The overall survival at 4 years was 86% for the CD34 + group and 74% for the PBPC group with a median follow-up of 37 months (range 1-61) and 46 months (range 4-82), respectively (P = 0.9).

[2] [3] [4] [5] Since previous reports indicate that infusion of tumour cells contaminating the bone marrow grafts contributes to relapse after HDT, 6,7 several methods have been developed for purging of tumour cells from the grafts. 8 HDT is increasingly used for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease (HD). Register data indicate that patients with HD supported with PBPC have a poorer outcome as compared to those given BM. 9 Whether this is related to infusion of contaminating tumour cells in the graft is at present not known. However, it has been shown that patients with HD have circulating clonogenic tumour cells, expressing the Hodgkin-associated surface antigen CD30. 10 Furthermore, we like others, have recently reported that patients with HD have a high number of atypical CD30 + cells in PBPC. [11] [12] [13] Therefore, removal of such unwanted cells prior to infusion might be of clinical benefit. 14, 15 The positive selection of CD34 + cells from PBPC has been used as the purging method in different types of cancer and gives a 3-4 log tumour cell removal without any significant negative influence on the haematological recovery after HDT. 16, 17 Since the Hodgkin cells do not express the CD34 antigen and other purging methods for HD are not clinically available, we purified the PBPC products by enrichment of the CD34 + cells. Recently, we reported that the atypical CD30 + cells were efficiently removed by CD34 + cell enrichment and that the use of such grafts gave a fast and sustained engraftment. 11, 12 A delayed lymphoid reconstitution of both B cells and T cells and an increased risk of infections have been observed after the use of selected CD34 + cells. [18] [19] [20] [21] Other reports, however, have not detected any difference between selected CD34 + cells and unmanipulated PBPC. 3,22-24 Fur-thermore, it is known that HD patients have an immune dysfunction and an impaired immune response. 25 Here, we present the results of haematological and immune reconstitution, the risk of infection and survival with the use of selected CD34 + cells and compare the data with another group of HD patients who received unmanipulated PBPC.

[18] [19] [20] [21] In this study, we report the clinical findings in a uniform group of patients with HD who received either purified CD34 + cells or unmanipulated PBPC. The haematological and immune reconstitution in both groups was rapid with normal levels of neutrophils, platelets, lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, CD56 + cells, and an increased level of B cells and CD8 + T cells at 3 months. The percentage of CD3 + T cells was low, primarily due to the delayed reconstitution of CD4 T cells, which led to an inverse CD4/CD8 ratio which also persisted 12 months post transplantation. Importantly, we did not observe significant differences in the reconstitution of any of these cell types between patients receiving either purified CD34 + cells or PBPC as stem cell support, except for somewhat lower levels of CD56 + cells in the PBPC group at 12 months. With the exception of some previous reports which showed a slower platelet recovery after the use of CD34 + selected stem cells, 5, 21 most studies experienced no differences in haematological recovery between the use of selected CD34 + cells or unmanipulated PBPC. [31] [32] [33] We observed a fast haematological engraftment in all patients after reinfusion with a median number of 5.8 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cells/kg in the CD34 + group and 4.5 \u00d7 10 6 in the PBPC group. In addition, the engraftment data indicate that G-CSF is not necessary after HDT when a satisfactory number of CD34 + cells are reinfused.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 434, "end": 438, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 439, "end": 443, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 444, "end": 448, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 449, "end": 453, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1425, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1564, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1569, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1574, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Importantly, the immune reconstitution was similar in both HD groups. At 3 and 12 months after HDT, the absolute lymphocyte count, the B cell (CD19, CD20), T cell (CD3, CD4, CD8) and CD56 + cell levels at 3 months were not different in the two groups (Figures 1 and 2) . In contrast to some previous reports, 34, 35 we found normal immunoglobulin levels at both 3 and 12 months in both groups. The median values of the absolute lymphocyte number in both groups at 3 and 12 months were above the upper normal range. Thus, the high percentage of B cells observed at both 3 and 12 months most likely reflects an increased number of B cells present. Similar results have also been observed by Mackall et al 35 in children and young adults giving a median of 7.2 \u00d7 10 6 CD34 + cell/kg. Some studies are in accordance with our results, 3,22-24 while others indicate that the use of enriched CD34 + cells gives delayed lymphoid reconstitution. [18] [19] [20] [21] One possible explanation for the different results obtained, is that as for the granulocyte and platelet recovery, a minimum number of CD34 + cells/kg has to be infused to achieve an optimal immune reconstitution. 23, 24, 35 In particular, Bomberger et al 18 found that when a mean number of 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 selected CD34 + cells/kg were infused, both recovery of T and B cells were severely affected during the first year after transplantation.
