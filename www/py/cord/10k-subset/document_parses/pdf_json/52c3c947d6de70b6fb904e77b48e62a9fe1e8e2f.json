Target of the inflammatory response is the myelin membrane that ensheats axons, as well as the oligodendrocytes that produce myelin. Histologically, EAE is characterised by perivascular infiltrates that principally contain CD4 \u03e9 T cells and macrophages, and by upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the brain (Owens et al., 1994; Zamvil and Steinman, 1990) .",

T-helper cells specific for encephalitogenic epitopes of MBP most likely initiate the inflammatory response. Passing the blood brain barrier (BBB) they accumulate in the perivascular lesions in the CNS together with blood born macrophages (Levine et al., 1975; Owens et al., 1994; Zamvil and Steinman, 1990) . Although the pathology of EAE is characterised by these infiltrating cells, the primary immune effector mechanisms responsible for the destruction of myelin membranes remain controversial. Destruction might be mediated by MHC class II-restricted CD4 \u03e9 T-cells via the local secretion of cytokines (Sun and Wekerle, 1986) or by the activation of microglia (Owens et al., 1994) , or by infiltrating macrophages (Huitinga et al., 1990) .",

Clinical signs of the disease started at day 9 and reached a peak at day 14 post immunisation (14 dpi). Thereafter, animals started to recover and at 18 dpi all had completely recovered from the disease. To induce this severe disease it was necessary to immunise rats with MBP in CFA containing high dose of myc.T. Normally for immunisation an antigen is emulsified in CFA containing 1 mg/ml myc.T. This amount of myc.T is sufficient to induce a strong immune response (Deeb et al., 1992; Johnston et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1992) . This concentration of myc.T in combination with the MBP batch used for these experiments was insufficient to induce severe neurological symptoms in EAE. After immunisation of rats with MBP in CFA containing 1 mg/ml myc.T most of the animals did not develop disease. Only 1 out of 6 animals showed mild clinical symptoms (clinical score \u03ed 1) at 14 dpi ( Fig. 2 ",

T-cell influx was accompanied by microglia activation, as 57% of isolated microglia expressed MHC class II molecules in the macrophage gate (Fig. 4d) . But even in the lymphocyte gate, a big proportion of microglial cells seemed to be activated in the affected tissue as indicated by upregulation of CD4 molecules on TCR negative cells (Fig. 4a compared with Fig. 4c) .",

Leukocytes were analysed by flow cytometry (Fig.  5 ). Progression to disease was characterised by T-cell influx in the brain of diseased animals. At 12 dpi 35% of isolated cells were T-cells, 27% CD4 \u03e9 and 8% CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the lymphocyte gate (Fig. 5a) . T-cell influx reached a maximum (48%) just at the maximum of disease at 14 dpi (Fig. 5c) and declined slowly during convalescence to 30% at 20 dpi. At any point of time analysed so far CD8 \u03e9 T-cells were a minority in the brain. Only 8% of isolated : a,b) , compared to rats after immunisation with MBP in CFA with low dose of myc.T antigens (14 dpi) (lower panel: c,d). Leukocytes extracted from the entire CNS by Percoll density centrifugation were pooled (from 3 animals). To differentiate between microglia and infiltrating macrophages, cells were labelled with the antibody OX1 (leukocyte common antigen \u03ed LCA). The LCA high-positive cell population resembles infiltrating macrophages, and LCA low-positive cells are resident microglia. In addition, cells were labelled with the anitbody OX6 (MHC class II). Analysed cells were gated for macrophages by criteria of forward and side scatter in Fig.  4b ,d. To characterise T-cells, leukocytes were labelled with the antibody R73 (TCR \u03b1 ) and the antibody W3/25 (CD4). Analysed cells were gated for lymphocytes by criteria of forward and side scatter in Fig. 4a ,c. Similar results were seen in at least four experiments Fig. 5 . FACS analysis of leukocytes isolated from the brain after induction of severe disease by immunising animals with MBP in CFA containing high dose of myc.T. Animals used for FACS analysis at 12 dpi already showed neurological signs (clinical score 2), at 14 dpi animals suffered from severe disease (clinical score 4) and at 20 dpi only rats convalescent from severe disease (clinical score 4) were used. Leukocytes extracted from the entire CNS by Percoll density centrifugation were pooled (from 3 animals each studied day). To differentiate between microglia and infiltrating macrophages, cells were labelled with the antibody OX1 (leukocyte common antigen \u03ed LCA).

Analysed cells were gated for lymphocytes by criteria of forward and side scatter in Fig. 5a ,c,e. Similar results have been observed in at least four experiments leukocytes expressed CD8 and TCR at 12 and 14 dpi and only 5% after recovery at 20 dpi (Fig. 5a,c,e) . The leukocyte influx varies early past immunisation and later past immunisation or between animals with high or low clinical score.

Different immunisation protocols were used to induce disease with different clinical score in order to identify the infiltrating cell populations dominating in the CNS of severely diseased animals. The phenomenon that induction of active EAE depends on the immunisation protocol is well known. After immunisation with MBP in incomplete Freunds adjuvants (IFA) Lewis rats fail to develop disease (Swierbors and Swanborg, 1977) . In this model, however, T-cells and peripheral macrophages fail to infiltrate the brain parenchyma. After immunisation of rats with MBP in CFA containing high dose of myc.T animals develop severe disease with high influx of T-cells and peripheral macrophages in brain tissue. However, in our hands even in this Table 1 . Comparison of brain infiltrating macrophages M\u00d8, brain infiltrating T-cells and the amount of activated microglia within the macrophage gate. The exact cell number of these different cell populations extracted from the brain of each animal was calculated (see Material and methods). Two animal groups were compared: four diseased animals at 14 dpi (clinical score \u03ed 2) after induction of EAE with high dose of myc.T. in the adjuvant and four rats without symptoms at 14 dpi with low dose of myc.T. in the adjuvant Rat Dose of myc T.

Despite the fact that these animals showed high T-cell influx in the CNS, peripheral macrophages failed to infiltrate the brain. This observation led to the animal model described in this paper. After immunisation of rats with CFA containing low dose of myc.T, and constant concentrations of the autoantigen MBP animals failed to develop severe symptoms, nevertheless, they showed strong T-cell influx in brain parenchyma. The simplest explanation of this phenomenon was the induction of a weaker T-cell response to the autoantigen. However, the situation seemed to be more complex. T-cell responses against MBP were similar in proliferation assays with lymphocytes isolated from animals immunised with MBP in CFA containing low dose of myc.T to responses in severely diseased animals immunised with MBP in CFA containing high dose of myc.T. Another explanation was the induction of a strong T-cell response specific for mycobacterial antigens imported to the brain. A similiar mechanism was reported for an other animal model: In the experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) it was shown that recruitment of antigen-nonspecific T-cells plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis (Caspi et al., 1993) , therefore, it had to be assumed that also in EAE high numbers of T-cells specific for mycobacterial antigens and infiltrating the brain may contribute to tissue destruction. However, after immunisation of rats with higher concentrations of myc.T the T-cell response against this antigen was similar to that of animals immunised with CFA containing low dose of myc.T. Therefore, neither the MBP specific T-cell response nor a strong T-cell response against mycobacterial antigens necessarily led to an onset of the disease. Fig. 6 . T-cell/macrophage ratio in leukocytes isolated from the brain of animals after induction of active EAE (14 dpi) with different clinical scores. Cells were extracted from the CNS by Percoll density centrifugation, characterised by flow cytometry and the real number of infiltrating T-cells and macrophages were calculated by multiplying the percentage of positive cells by the total mumber of leukocytes calculated for the specific gate. The ratio between T-cells and macrophages was plotted versus clinical score.",

Therefore, Th2 cells may be generated in the current model. But even this possibility has to be excluded. A strong MBP-specific T-cell response of the Th2 subtype can be induced in rats after targeting the autoantigen to Bcells. These cells show a different migration behaviour and do not infiltrate the brain parenchyma (Saoudi et al., 1995) . Thus, Th2 cells fail to pass the blood brain barrier and do not induce MHCII expression on microglia. CFA is known to induce a strong Th1 response (Audibert and Lise, 1993) and, indeed, after immunisation of rats with MBP in CFA (low dose of myc.T), a strong T-cell influx in the brain parenchyma accompanied by microglia activation as indicated by upregulation of MHC II on these cells, was observed.",

These data clearly support the assumption that macrophages are the principal cause of tissue destruction in the CNS in EAE. The liposomes used in that study could pass the blood brain barrier (Huitinga et al., 1990) . Therefore, it can not be excluded that after treating animals with toxic liposomes to deplete peripheral macrophages, activated microglia may be affected, too, by loosing its lytic capacity. The data presented here demonstrate that activation of microglia was not necessary to induce tissue destruction in the CNS. It seems that infiltrating T-cells recruit peripheral macrophages after they encounter their antigen. Indeed, in all animals with severe disease examined in the present study, strong macrophage infiltrates were detected in brain parenchyma. In contrast no infiltrating macrophages were found in brain parenchyma of rats without symptoms after immunisation. Thus, the number of infiltrating macrophages in the brain parenchyma correlated well with the disease. In addition, T-cells persisted longer in brain parenchyma than macrophages. During the convalescence period and even after recovery from disease strong T-cell influx accompanied by microglia activation was detected in the brain. In contrast peripheral macrophages disappeared soon from the brain in the period of recovery. These results clearly indicate that infiltrating macrophages are responsible for tissue destruction in the brain during active EAE and that microglia, although sharing many properties with peripheral macrophage, is functionally distinct from infiltrating macrophages.",

However, there was no correlation between T-cell infiltration and severity of symptoms. The most striking neuropathologic correlate was the high absolute number of infiltrating macrophages. Therefore, infiltrating macrophages are concluded to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of EAE. It can not be excluded that T-cells contribute directly to tissue destruction, but it seems more reasonable that infiltrating T-cells may recruit macrophages which eventually cause the tissue damage. T-cells and microglia may initiate the immune reaction in the CNS, but other cell types including macrophages seem to be required for development of a full blown inflammation followed by tissue destruction.",
