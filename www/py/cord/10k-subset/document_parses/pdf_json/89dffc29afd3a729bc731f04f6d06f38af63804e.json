He was suffering from fever, fatigue, nausea and vomiting for 3 days. He was living in Kastamonu, an endemic area, where he owned some cows and had received a tick bite on his back. He was hospitalised, isolated and administered supportive therapy under barrier nursing. His condition deteriorated as he developed respiratory and renal Abstract Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease, mostly transmitted by tick bites or through contact with infected animal's blood, and bodily fluids. Nosocomial infections were occasionally reported in healthcare settings. We report nosocomial cluster of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever including the visitor with unknown transmission.",

Nosocomial transmission is also possible in a similar way and poses a threat for healthcare workers (HCWs). Although the number of cases diagnosed as CCHF has been decreasing over the years, Turkey has encountered one of the largest epidemics in the world since the detection of the first case in 2002 [3] . Only a few cases of nosocomial transmission of CCHF to healthcare workers have been reported till date [4] . Most of these nosocomial cases bear histories of percutaneous injuries or contact with contaminated blood without adequate barrier precautions. Here, we report nosocomial cases of CCHF from visitors and healthcare workers even in the absence of a percutaneous injury or contact with contaminated body fluid. The cases were diagnosed at two different hospitals located in different cities. Nosocomial clustering of the CCHF cases was perceived during personal communications between the doctors.",

One doctor and one nurse were attending him, and four visitors were allowed during different hours for a short while. In this nosocomial outbreak, the nurse was the first case. She was enquired regarding her appropriate and consistent use of personal protective equipment while entering the patient room, any events of splashing of patient's bodily fluids, and was checked for the presence of punctures on her hands, etc. A similar detailed history was also obtained from the doctor. The doctor and the nurse had been in the patient room without mask for a very short time. The visitors were also enquired regarding their place of living, possibility of contact with ticks, animal holdings, their profession and events of close contact with the index case or any known CCHF case outside the hospital. Case 1 was living in a different city. Both of the visitors had no contact with the index case out of the hospital. We did not get any data about transmission of CCHF out of the hospital. The second case had been in the patient's room for ~10 min twice. Both of the visitors declared that they had used masks, gowns and gloves. Our clinic nurses confirmed their declaration. We could not investigate the environmental samples, since the symptoms in the secondary cases appeared 4-5 days after the death of the index case. As a rule, patient rooms are cleaned and disinfected after each case. Nosocomial cases among healthcare workers (HCWs) and small hospital outbreaks of CCHF have been reported from epidemic countries, including Turkey. Available data indicate that percutaneous exposure or contact with infected bodily fluids is the primary route of nosocomial transmission of CCHF [4, 6, 7] . Indeed, most of the previously reported cases have a history of close contact with the index patient's blood or needle stick injury. In our study, none of the cases came in contact with blood or secretions of the index case, and they did not have any percutaneous injury either.",
