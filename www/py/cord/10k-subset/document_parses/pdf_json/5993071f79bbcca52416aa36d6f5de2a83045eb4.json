Therefore, in this study, we preferred the use of adjusted estimates of the effect to minimize potential confounding between the treatment groups. However, five studies reported adjusted estimates of mortality, and their inclusion in the meta-analysis still revealed a higher odds of mortality related to steroids use. Good evidences indicated that secondary bacterial pneumonia is an www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ important cause of mortality related to influenza 32, 33 . Therefore, increasing risk of nosocomial infection due to corticosteroid treatment may partly account for the potential harm from corticosteroid use. Two included studies 8, 15 found that secondary bacterial pneumonia such as due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or invasive fungal infection, were more common in corticosteroid-treated patients. Several studies showed that prolonged viral shedding and delayed viral clearance were noted in corticosteroid-treated patients 10, 34 , whereas slower clearance of virus loads was associated with higher mortality in patients with ARDS due to H1N1pdm09 virus infection 35 .
