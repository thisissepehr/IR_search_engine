On Day 2 of admission the patient developed significant respiratory distress due to increase in bilateral pleural effusion and ascites, and this necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. Platelet counts also dropped to 17,000/mm 3 and he was transfused with 3 units of platelet rich plasma (PRP). Capillary leak resolved after 72 hrs but thrombocytopenia persisted and the patient required daily PRP transfusions. The hospital course was further complicated by pneumonia, and subsequently, by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The child responded to intravenous antimicrobials, followed by intravenous corticosteroids, and was weaned off the ventilator after 4 wks. During this period of 4 week, the thrombocytopenia persisted and the child received a total of 50 units of PRP to maintain the platelet counts above 40,000/mm 3 ; multiple DIC profiles and blood cultures were negative. Bone marrow biopsy revealed normalcy of all three cell lines. Anti-platelet antibody assay was positive for antiplatelet IgG antibody. One week after extubation, the child suddenly developed features of raised intracranial pressure. Cranial non-contrast computerized tomogram (NCCT) was suggestive of massive intracranial bleed in the right temporo-parietal region with mid line shift; he soon herniated and died despite supportive care. Platelet count at the time of bleed was 70,000/ mm 3 .",
