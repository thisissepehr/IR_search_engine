CMV serostatus and plasma loads were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassays and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-18, interferon-gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), neutrophilic elastase, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and IL-10 were measured at five time points by multiplex immunoassay. The effects of CMV reactivation on sequential concentrations of these biomarkers were assessed in multivariable mixed models. Results: Among 64 CMV+ patients, 45 could be matched to CMVs+ or CMVs\u2212 controls or both. The two baseline characteristics and host response biomarker levels at viremia onset were similar between groups. CMV+ patients had increased IP-10 on day 7 after viremia onset (symmetric percentage difference +44% versus \u221215% when compared with CMVs+ and +37% versus +4% when compared with CMVs\u2212) and decreased IL-1RA (\u221241% versus 0% and \u221249% versus +10%, respectively).

First, this was an explorative study evaluating multiple host response biomarkers. We chose a lower P value threshold of significance in order to decrease the risk of spurious findings due to multiple testing, but false-negative findings remain an accessory risk to keep in mind also when considering our study sample size. Unfortunately, a formal sample size calculation for this kind of statistical analysis was not possible. Nevertheless, we postulate that possible immunomodulating effects of CMV reactivation IL-18 6.5 (5.9-6.9) 6.4 (5.9-6.6) 0.46 6.3 (5.9-6.7) 6.4 (5.9-6.7) 0.77 IP-10 6.5 (6.0-7.0) 6.3 (5.9-6.8) 0. seem at most to be rather limited in these patients because no large differences in biomarker levels between matched groups were observed. Second, we analyzed host response biomarkers as standalone markers, which is probably a simplification of the complex immune response. However, large sample sizes are required to perform more advanced network analyses, and the integration of time series in such analyses, to our knowledge, has not been conducted before. We also measured only the plasma concentrations. Since CMV pneumonitis could be an important mediator of the pathological effect of CMV reactivation in critically ill patients, bronchoalveolar lavage samples may be additionally informative but were not available [16, 29] . Finally, we did not evaluate all potentially relevant biomarkers for CMV reactivation; thus, future studies are needed before an immunomodulating effect of CMV can be ruled out with certainty as an important pathological mechanism in previously immunocompetent ICU patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1383, "end": 1387, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1391, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study could not demonstrate an independent immunomodulating effect of CMV reactivation in patients with sepsis.
