This particle collector has three different inlet/outlet configurations: forward inlet/outlet (FO), backward inlet/outlet (BO) and straight inlet/outlet (SO) configurations. We also present the electrostatic capture of Vaccinia viruses using the same particle collector and compare these virus measurements with the nanoparticle cases. The most particles were collected in the FO configuration. The numbers of particles captured in the BO and SO configurations were close within their standard deviations. For all the three configurations tested, the number of particles captured in the center electrode C was much smaller than those captured in the other electrodes at a flow rate of 1.1 l min \u22121 and an applied potential of 2 kV. Using a commercial CFD code FLUENT, we also simulated the effects of the three inlet/outlet configurations on the particle capture in terms of particle trajectories, velocities and travel times. This simulation was in a good agreement with measurements that the FO configuration is the most favorable to particle capture among the tested configurations at a flow rate of 1.1 l min \u22121 . The effects of particle diameters on the capture will also be discussed. This collector can be used for real-time monitoring of bioaerosols along with cantilever biosensors.",

These tests are well established, but they require several assay steps, welltrained technical staff and a significant time to obtain reliable results (Ivnitski et al 1999 , Dhayal et al 2006 . Therefore, sensitive biosensors that accurately detect, in a label-free manner and in real time, are highly required (Ivnitski et al 1999 , Lazcka et al 2007 . Among the biosensors, cantileverbased mass sensors have been widely used in bio-medical applications due to the very high sensitivity of the cantilever structure (Lavrik and Datskos 2003 , Lavrik et al 2004 , Gupta et al 2004 , Waggoner and Craighead 2007 . They generally work better in the gas state because of higher quality factors and hence higher sensitivity than in the liquid state, which may make it unnecessary to introduce airborne microorganisms into liquids. However, the number of biological particles that can be placed on the cantilever surfaces for detection is usually very small compared to the total number of particles tested, which requires an active collection method such as electrostatic capture to increase overall sensor sensitivity.",

The advantage of this particle collector is that flow swirling makes particles stay long and slow down in the collector, which gives rise to many particles to be captured. In this paper, we will investigate the effects of the inlet/outlet configurations of the particle collector on the electrostatic capture of nanoparticles with simulation and experiments. In fact, the number of particles flowing in the collector varies spatially along the collector, depending on the inlet/outlet configurations. Therefore, it is critical to find information on where inside the collector the most particles flow because biosensors need to be exposed to as many particles as possible, especially if the biosensors involve cantilevers. We also present the capture of Vaccinia viruses with different flow rates in the same collector and compare these measurements with nanoparticle experiments. The highest and smallest capture positions inside the collector will be determined by these experiments. The effects of particle diameters on the electrostatic capture will also be discussed. This collector is well suited for integration with cantilever sensors for the detection of bioaerosols and can be a promising choice in terms of real-time monitoring.",

The error bars represent the standard deviations of the measurements. The flow rate of 1.1 l min \u22121 was chosen because it is recommended by TSI for the electrospray aerosol generator. Moreover, many handheld airflow devices work at a flow rate range of several liters per minute. We observed that much more particles were captured in the FO configuration than the other two configurations. In fact, the number of particles collected in the FO configuration was about 3-6 times larger than that collected in the SO configuration, depending on the electrode. We also observed that the number of particles captured in the BO configuration was slightly larger than that captured in the SO configuration although the measurements in both configurations were overlapped within their standard deviations. It is interesting that the least particles were captured in the SO configuration, which is most commonly used. For all the three configurations, the particle counts in the electrodes A, B, D and E were shown to be close within their uncertainties while the particle counts captured in the center electrode C were much less than those captured in the other surrounding electrodes. In fact, the particle counts captured on the electrode C were about 30-40% of those captured on the electrode E in the three configurations. Therefore, the center position is the last to place the biosensor for all the three configurations. We will further discuss these measurements with simulation in the next section.",

Unlike the above two configurations, the median travel time in the FO configuration is 4-5 times longer. In fact, the median travel times of all the test particles at a flow rate of 1.1 l min \u22121 are 4.95 s, 1.40 s and 0.96 s in the FO, BO and SO configurations, respectively. That is, the particles in the FO configuration stay much longer inside the collector than those in the other configurations do, which is highly beneficial to particle capture. It should be noticed that the smaller particle ids in figure 3(a) are to the right side of the inlet surface when the inlet surface is seen from the negative x side.

In the BO configuration, only the particles starting on the further right side of the inlet surface swirl in the collector before they leave the collector. In the FO configuration, many particles from the right side to the center of the inlet surface swirl in the collector (see figure 3(b) ).

However, particle capture measurements in both configurations were shown to be close within their standard deviations. This can be attributed to the fact that the particles in the BO configuration stay almost as long as those in the SO configuration do. In fact, if two particles flow with the same velocities at the same distance from the same electrode, the particle staying longer under the electric field will have a higher probability to be captured. Likewise, more particles in the FO configuration are shown to flow slowly than those in the BO configuration for all the electrodes. In addition, the travel times of particles in the FO configuration are much longer than those in the other configurations. This simulation shows a good agreement with the experimental data that the most particles were captured in the FO configuration. According to the experiments and simulations above, we can conclude that the FO configuration is the most advantageous to particle capture among the tested configurations.",

The medians of the travel times at a flow rate of 1.1 l min \u22121 are 4.95 s, 1.40 s and 0.96 s in the FO, BO and SO configurations, respectively. effective particle sizes. Table 1 (a) shows the number of test particles passing through volumes made up of the electrode areas and collector height for different particle sizes in the FO configuration at 1.1 l min \u22121 . The simulation shows that the number of 10 \u00b5m diameter particles flowing over the electrodes B and D decreases compared to the smaller particles, which means that the inertia of those large particles gets more important in particle transport and those particles are reluctant to swirl in the collector. The increase in inertia can also happen to the large particles flowing over the electrodes A, C and E, but these electrodes are in the straight line of the incoming flow path so the number of particles does not change as much as the electrode B and D cases. The increased inertia may cause more particle losses before the collector due to sedimentation or abrupt change in the flow path (Brockmann 2001) . Figure 5 shows an SEM image of Vaccinia viruses before electrospray particle generation, which was obtained by putting a drop of virus suspension on a silicon chip and drying it, and the insets show the SEM images of two types of single Vaccinia virus particles captured on the electrodes C and E at 2 kV, 1.2 l min \u22121 for 30 min in the FO configuration.

The electrodes C and E were chosen because these two represent the least and most particle capture electrodes, respectively, according to the aforementioned measurements and simulations. The white dots in the images indicate Vaccinia virus particles. Table 1 (b) shows the number of Vaccinia viruses captured on the electrodes C and E at an area of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00b5m 2 at 2 kV when 10 12 Vaccinia virus particles are generated at the capillary tip. The numbers in the parentheses indicate the standard deviations of the measurements. Like the nanoparticle cases, the number of virus particles captured on the electrode E is larger than that captured on the electrode C and more viruses are captured at lower flow rates. The number of virus particles captured on the electrode C were about 13 and 29% of those captured on the electrode E at 1.2 and 2.0 l min \u22121 , respectively. It is interesting that less Vaccinia viruses are captured compared to the nanoparticles. In fact, the viruses are captured 3-11 times less than the nanoparticles are, depending on the electrode and flow rates. One of the possible reasons is that these viruses may be polydisperse rather than monodisperse when they become airborne from the suspension. Consequently, larger particles may drop before they reach the particle collector or they may be less attracted to the electrodes in the collector because of their larger inertia.",
