The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with PTB. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Global Health, for cohort and case-control studies that reported risk factors for inhospital mortality in PTB. We pooled all factors that were assessed for an association, and presented relative associations as pooled odds ratios (ORs). Results: We identified 2,969 records, of which we retrieved 51 in full text; 11 cohort studies that evaluated 5,468 patients proved eligible. Moderate quality evidence suggested an association with co-morbid malignancy and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.01-3.40). Low quality evidence showed no association with positive sputum smear (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.40-2.48), or male sex (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84-1.41), and very low quality evidence showed no association with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.31, 95% IC 0.38-4.46), and previous TB infection (OR 2.66, 95% CI 0.48-14.87).
