Milstein for helpful discussions. J.F. is a Fellow of the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research. Received Insulin is a polypeptide hormone of major physiological importance in the regulation of fuel homeostasis in animals (reviewed in refs 1, 2). It is synthesized by the Il-cells of pancreatic islets, and circulating insulin levels are regulated by several small molecules, notably glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and certain pharmacological agents. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B, linked by disulphide bonds) that are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of pro insulin, generating equimolar amounts of the mature insulin and a connecting peptide (C-peptide). Humans, like most vertebrates, contain one proinsulin gene 3 ,4, although several species, including mice! and rats 6 ,7, have two highly homologous insulin genes. We have studied the regulation of serum insulin levels and of insulin gene expression by generating a series of transgenic mice containing the human insulin gene. We report here that the human insulin gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the islets of these transgenic mice, and that serum human insulin levels are properly regulated by glucose, amino acids and tolbutamide, an oral hypoglycaemic agent.",

Of 46 mice born after one series of single-cell embryo microinjections, three contained human insulin gene sequences as detected by Southern hybridization analysis (Fig. 1a) . A human C-peptide radioimmunoassay (Behringwerke) was used to monitor expression of the human insulin gene in the transgenic mice and their offspring. Several hundred transgenic and control mice have been analysed under a variety of physiological circumstances (see below), and the transgenic mice show variable levels of human C-peptide in their sera, whereas control mice show no such expression.",

Because no transgenic tissues other than pancreas were found to express detectable levels of insulin RNA, insulin expression in both transgenic and control pancreas was studied to determine whether the transgenic pancreas is a site of human insulin expression. Pancreatic islets from six transgenic and six control mice were isolated by collagenase digestion as described previously8,9 and cultured in groups of 80-100 islets per tissue culture well. The following day, aliquots of media were taken and human Cpeptide levels measured. The samples from the transgenic islet wells contained 250-650 ng ml-1 of human C-peptide, but the control islet wells contained no detectable human C-peptide. The cultured transgenic islets continued to express human Cpeptide for several days. From these experiments, we conclude that the major site of human insulin expression in these transgenic mice is the endocrine pancreas.",

            "text": "Glucose and human C-peptide levels in the transgenic mice were studied under a variety of physiological conditions to determine whether normal glucose homeostasis was being preserved and whether expression of the human insulin gene was being regulated appropriately in these mice. Blood glucose regulation was studied by glucose tolerance tests. Transgenic offspring of mouse 16 and non-transgenic siblings were fasted overnight, given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of glucose, and bled at various times after injection to determine serum glucose levels. The glucose tolerance curve from the transgenic mice was similar to that from the control mice (Fig. 3a) . Of particular importance is the finding that the fasting and maximally stimulated glucose levels as well as the kinetics of Neither the mouse insulin cDNA nor gene sequences have been determined, but since the coding re~ions of the human and rat insulin mRNAs share 81 % sequence homology 5, it was expected that both transgenic and control pancreatic RNAs would hybridize to the human insulin cDNA probe. Methods. A 12.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the human insulin gene' was isolated from pBR322 sequences by preparative gel electrophoresis and electroelution l6 . Fertilized mouse eggs for microinjection were recovered in cumulus from the oviducts of (C57 x C3H)F I females that had mated with FI males several hours earlier. Approximately 1,000 copies of the human insulin gene fragment were microinjected into the male pronucleus of each fertilized egg. Microinjected eggs were implanted into the oviducts of I-day pseudopregnant ICR foster mothers and carried to term 17 \u2022 Several weeks after the birth of animals that developed from microinjected eggs, total genomic DNA was prepared l8 from mouse tails. For the Southern blot analysis in a, 8 fLg of total genomic DNA for each mouse were digested with PvuII, subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.9% agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulosel 9 \u2022 The filter was then prehybridized overnight, hybridized to a 32P_Iabelled genomic human insulin probe, washed and exposed to X-ray film. The genomic human insulin probe is a fragment that extends from a BglII site at -169 with respect to the transcriptional start site of the human insulin gene to an AvaI site at +644 (ref. 4 ). In addition to promoter sequences, this fragment contains the first intervening sequence, the first exon (including sequences encoding the signal peptide, B-peptide and a portion of C-peptide), and a portion of the second intervening sequence. Approximately 75% of the genomic human insulin probe consists of non coding sequences that are not highly conserved between species, which explains its limited cross-hybridization with the endogenous mouse insulin genes (which can be detected only after long exposures). Total cellular RNA was isolated from tissue samples by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/ caesium chloride technique 20 . For Northern blot analysis, 4 fLg of total RNA from each sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters l6 . The filter was then prehybridized, hybridized to a 32P_Iabelled human insulin cDNA IS probe, washed and exposed to X-ray film. Fig. 2 Immunoperoxidase staining of transgenic and control pancreas. Pancreas samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen and 4-lLm tissue sections were prepared using a cryostat. Immunoperoxidase staining of serial sections was performed as described previousll 1 , using either guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antibody (a and b) or goat anti-human C-peptide antibody (c and d). a, Transgenic pancreas stained with anti-insulin antibody (Arnel Products). b, Control pancreas stained with antiinsulin antibody. c, Transgenic pancreas stained with anti-human Cpeptide antibody (Behringwerke). d, Control pancreas stained with antihuman C-peptide antibody (photographically enhanced to allow visualization of islets). Other transgenic tissues, including liver, adrenal and thyroid, are not stained using the guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antibody (not shown). data are similar to glucose tolerance results previously reported for both mice 22 and humans 2 . Preliminary experiments suggest that mouse 20 also expresses human C-peptide and responds to a glucose tolerance test, and more extensive studies will be performed when mouse 20 and mouse 38 have generated large colonies. An assay specific for mouse C-peptide is not available, and we were unable to compare levels of endogenous mouse C-peptide with levels of human C-peptide. the return to basal glucose levels were similar for the transgenic and control animals. In addition, intravenous (i.v.) administration of glucagon increased serum glucose levels by -50% within 15 min in both transgenic and control mice. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that serum glucose levels were appropriately modulated in the transgenic mice. The weights of the transgenic mice, growth rates, feeding behaviour, reproductive capability and longevity appeared normal. The role of human insulin in the regulation of blood glucose levels in transgenic mice was investigated by performing a glucose tolerance test on transgenic and control mice (Fig. 3b) . No human C-peptide was detected in the sera of fasting transgenic mice, but within 10 min of i.p. administration of glucose, human C-peptide appeared in the serum, and peak levels were attained within -20 min. By 45 min post-glucose, human Cpeptide levels fell to values approaching the pre-stimulation or basal level. This pattern of human C-peptide expression correlates closely with the glucose tolerance curves presented above, and suggests that serum human insulin levels were being appropriately regulated by glucose. The control mice did not express any detectable human C-peptide, indicating that the human gene must have been the source of the human C-peptide in the transgenic animals.",

Because at least one additional insulin gene is being expressed in the transgenic mice and total insulin RNA and protein levels are approximately the same as in control mice, the question of dosage compensation can be investigated. Moreover, our tolbutamide results indicate that drugs thought to affect human insulin metabolism can now be tested in an in vivo animal system.

The importance of the role of recombination is far less evident for the RNA-based genomes that occur in most plant viruses and in many animal viruses. RNA recombination has been shown to promote the evolutionary variation of picornaviruses l -4, it is involved in the creation of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of positive-and negative-strand virusesS--9 and is implicated in the synthesis of the messenger RNAs of influenza virus lO and coronavirus ll \u2022 However, RNA recombination has not been found to date in viruses that infect plants. In fact, the lack of DI RNAs and the inability to demonstrate recombination in mixedly infected plants has been regarded as evidence that plants do not support recombination of viral RNAs. Here we provide the first molecular evidence for recombination of plant viral RNA. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plus-stranded, tripartite-genome virus of monocots, we show that a deletion in the 3' end region of a single BMV RNA genomic component can be repaired during the development of infection by recombination with the homologous region of either of the two remaining wild-type BMV RNA components. This result clearly shows that plant viruses have available powerful recombinatory mechanisms that previously were thought to exist only in animal hosts, thus they are able to adapt and diversify in a manner comparable to animal viruses. Moreover, our observation suggests an increased versatility of viruses for use as vectors in introducing new genes into plants.",

DNA samples digested with PvuII are from the following microinjected mice: lane I, mouse 16, containing 5-10 copies of the human insulin gene fragment per haploid genome; lane 2, mouse 20, also containing 5-10 copies of the human insulin gene fragment per haploid genome; lane 3, mouse 21, negative for human insulin sequences, demonstrating that the endogenous mouse insulin genes do not hybridize significantly to the human insulin genomic probe; lane 4, human control, containing I copy of the human insulin gene per haploid genome; lane 5, mouse 38, containing 1-2 copies of the human insulin gene fragment per haploid genome (this DNA sample was analysed in a separate experiment in which the hybridizing band was of comparable intensity to the human control). DNA samples from each transgenic mouse contain a hybridizing band of -1,600 bp which corresponds to a 1,594\u00b7bp PvuII fragment contained within the 12.5\u00b7kb human insulin DNA fragment' used for microinjection. This result suggests that at least one structurally intact human insulin gene was incorporated into the genome of each transgenic animal, although the presence of mUltiple hybridizing bands in lane 2 indicates that other integration events are likely to have occurred during the embryogenesis of mouse 20. Mouse 16, a male, was bred to generate a colony of several hundred offspring, and the human insulin gene was transmitted in mendelian fashion, with -50% of both the FI and F2 offspring inheriting the injected DNA fragment. b, Detection of human and mouse insulin messenger RNAs in tissues of transgenic and control mice. Total cellular RNA samples are from transgenic and non-transgenic offspring of mouse 16 as follows: lane I, non-transgenic pancreas; lane 2, transgenic spleen; lane 3, transgenic kidney; lane 4, transgenic brain; lane 5, transgenic lung; lane 6, transgenic liver; lane 7, transgenic salivary gland; lane 8, transgenic intestine; lane 9, transgenic heart; lane 10, transgenic muscle; lane 11, transgenic pancreas.",
