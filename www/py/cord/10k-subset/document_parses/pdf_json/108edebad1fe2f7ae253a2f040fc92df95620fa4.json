Clinical information about the 24year-old pregnant woman (with a fetus at 4 months gestation) who was investigated in this study is detailed elsewhere [3] . H5N1 virus-infected autopsy tissue samples were fixed in 4% formalin, were embedded in paraffin, and were sectioned at 4 mm. Two H5N1 virus-positive control tissue samples were used. One was a lung tissue sample from the patient, and the other was a brain tissue sample from an H5N1 virus-infected blackheaded gull. In addition, in a previous study of the same placenta by our group [1] , we observed H5N1 virus-infected macrophages and trophoblastic cells. Therefore, cells from the same placenta were used as additional internal positive control samples when we attempted to determine whether the neutrophils were infected in the same tissue sections [1] . Three H5N1 virusuninfected placental samples were used as negative control samples. This investigation was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and the procedures were approved by the Research Administrative Committee of Peking University (Beijing, China). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described elsewhere [4] . Monoclonal antibodies against nucleoprotein (NP) and hemagglutinin (HA) were used to identify H5N1 virusspecific NP and HA, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against cell markers of CD15 (neutrophils), CD20 (B lymphocytes), CD3 (T lymphocytes), and CD68 (macrophages) were used to identify specific cell types, at a dilution of 1:100. Secondary antibodies against the primary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase, and the color reaction was developed with a horseradish peroxidase reaction kit (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole; Zymed Laboratories), which resulted in a red signal. When double labeling was performed, alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibodies were used to identify the primary antibodies against NP, and the color reaction was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega), which resulted in a purple-blue signal. Omission of the primary antibodies was also used as a negative control test.",

Positive and negative control tissue samples were identical to those used for immunohistochemistry. Double labeling was performed to identify cell types with CD15 as a marker for neutrophils. In this case, we used purpleblue for NP signals and red for CD15 signals, to achieve a good contrast to best illuminate the colocalization of the H5N1 virus and the cell marker. In brief, immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization to detect NP antigen or NP RNA sequence was performed first, and the color reaction was developed to give a purple-blue signal. The sections were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies against CD15 (neutrophil marker), and the color reaction was developed to give a red signal.

Leukocytes dissected from an uninfected placenta served as a negative control group.

There is no known case of neutrophil infection with virus in human influenza in vivo, and the result of our study represents, to our knowledge, the first observation of neutrophil infection due to H5N1 virus in a patient with human avian influenza. In our study, we found that H5N1 viral proteins and nucleotide sequences localized in placental neutrophils and that H5 sequences localized in leukocytes among placenta villi from an H5N1 virus-infected patient. Positive signals were present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. NP-and HAimmunopositive neutrophils observed in the spleen indicate that this phenomenon probably occurs throughout the circulation.",

Viral hepatitis DNA was detected in neutrophils [10] [11] [12] , and other viruses could be phagocytized by neutrophils [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, H5N1 virus might enter neutrophils via phagocytosis in a similar manner. Recently, we reported the presence of avian influenza receptors on the surface of a number of human cell types, including neutrophils [16] ; therefore, the H5N1 virus might enter neutrophils via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several viruses, including cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, were reported to replicate in neutrophils [17] [18] [19] . The nuclear localization of viral protein in our study suggests that H5N1 virus might also be capable of replicating in neutrophils.",

It was reported that H5N1 virus could replicate in dendritic cells and reduce their survival rate [20] . In addition, it was observed that numerous leukocytes were apoptotic in the lungs of an H5N1 virus-infected patient [21] . Therefore, H5N1 virus may accelerate the destruction of neutrophils by direct killing or apoptosis and may cause the neutropenia that is frequently observed in H5N1 virus infection.
