The overall individual animal seroprevalence of RVFV four years after the last outbreak was 29.7%, and it was 43.0% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep, and 9.3% in goats. For cattle and sheep, these results are comparable to seroprevalences reported in 2013 from Kenya 30,31 and Tanzania 32 , six years after the 2006/2007 East African RVF outbreak, bearing in mind that some of the animals in this study were vaccinated for RVF whereas vaccinated herds were excluded from the studies in Kenya and Tanzania 31,32 . After adjustment for confounding, cattle were more likely to be seropositive than both sheep and goats.

Several other studies have also reported lower seroprevalences in goats, in Kenya 33 , Rwanda 34 , Comoros 35 , Mozambique 18 and Mauritania 36 . In our study, the higher seroprevalence in cattle, and to a lesser extent sheep, may be partially explained by the fact that cattle and sheep are predominantly commercially reared and farmers in general may place more value on them than on goats; therefore, they were more likely to be vaccinated. Although vaccination history was obtained in the survey and included in the final multivariable model, in most cases the accuracy of this information was dependent on the farmers' recall and misclassification of exposure may have occurred.

This is supported by the fact that, within this sub-group the seroprevalence increased with age, with animals born shortly after the last outbreak more likely to have been exposed. Unreported or subclinical cases are therefore likely to have occurred after the last outbreak.

Two hypotheses have been proposed for RVFV, with varying degrees of investigative evidence, namely survival of the virus in embryonated eggs laid in the dry margins of seasonal wetlands (infected transovarially) 10 and survival of virus in overwintering Culex mosquitoes 37 . The reproductive biology of the members of the Aedes genus, requiring drying of eggs prior to hatching, favours the former hypothesis and that of the multivoltine genus, Culex, favours the latter 38 . Evidence for overwintering of RVFV in adult mosquitoes is lacking but the flavivirus, West Nile virus, has been proven experimentally and observationally to overwinter in Culex species in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere 39, 40 . In South Africa, quiescent adult female Culex spp., including Cx. theileri, considered to be the main epidemic vector on the inland plateau 12 , have been shown to overwinter 41, 42 . Typical hibernacula for adult mosquitoes include caves, tree-holes and building infrastructure 43 .

Communal farmers, who were likely less informed about the economic importance of RVF, were less likely to have vaccinated their animals. Although vaccination history was included in the multivariable model, it is likely that inaccuracy in these data, as well as the fact that the majority of communal farmers were unsure of their animals' vaccination status, resulted in failure to fully account for this confounding. It is also likely that private farms were in general situated in better farming areas, with more water available and therefore more suitable for vector breeding and disease transmission.

Care should be taken when comparing published ICCs since some authors report the statistic on the logistic scale, calculated during the estimation of a multilevel logistic regression model. For example, Bett et al. 30 in Kenya reported herd-and village-level ICCs on the logistic scale (\u03c1 (l) ) of 0.3 and 0.22 respectively; our estimates of \u03c1 (l) , ranging between 0.22 and 0.41, were somewhat higher, reflecting greater between-herd variation in seroprevalence than in Kenya, where outbreaks occur more frequently and conditions are likely more conducive to interepidemic viral circulation and widespread exposure 26 . Vaccination may also artificially inflate estimates of \u03c1, evident in the reduction in estimated \u03c1 when vaccinated herds/flocks were excluded, as when farmers vaccinate they are likely to vaccinate all of the animals at risk, and even if they vaccinate a portion every year it is likely that the older animals were vaccinated previously. In our study area, the presence of large areas without surface water is likely to have resulted in spatial variation in distribution of mosquito vectors.

Random points were generated within the study area, with selection probability proportional to the density of livestock-owning households obtained from the results of the 2011 National Census (K. Parry, Statistics South Africa, 2014, pers. comm.). This was done by first excluding census units (known as small areas) less than ~1 km 2 in extent which, based on Google Earth imagery (http://earth.google.com), represented urban areas, mainly in Bloemfontein and Kimberley. For each of the remaining 262 small areas, a Poisson-distributed random number with mean proportional to the number of livestock-owning households was generated in order to determine the number of points to be generated in each. 350 random geographic points were thus generated using Arc Toolbox in ArcGIS 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, U.S.A.). Since the exact number of farms to be sampled in order to achieve the required number of each species was unknown, the list was randomly sorted and the points were then sampled in the sequence they appeared on the list; this ensured that the points actually used constituted a random sample. Each point was plotted on a Google Earth map of the study area and the farm nearest to each selected point was identified with the help of state veterinary officials.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study setting and ethical approvals.

Where possible, systematic random sampling was done, with three animals of each species selected within each age category. In many cases, however, a combination of haphazard and convenience sampling was used, with farm workers selecting animals from each age category. If the required number of animals in each age group was not available, additional animals were selected from the other age groups. With some exceptions, explained below, a maximum of nine cattle, nine sheep and, nine goats were sampled per farm. In cases where the number of cattle, sheep or goats on the selected farms was less than nine, all the available cattle, sheep or goats were sampled. On farms that reported that they had never vaccinated their animals, up to 50 sheep were sampled, if available, in order to identify seronegative sheep for a parallel cohort study that is still ongoing and will be reported separately. Sampling of farms continued, using the randomly sorted list of co-ordinates, until the minimum required number of each species was achieved.

An inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on tissue culture-derived whole virus RVFV antigen, with reported diagnostic sensitivity of 93-100% and diagnostic specificity of 99-100% 59,60 , was carried out as previously described with minor modification 59 . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 100 \u03bcL per well of polyclonal sheep anti-RVFV capture antibody diluted 1:500 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS without Ca and Mg, pH 7.4). Plates were washed three times with 300 \u03bcL per well of wash buffer (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) after overnight incubation. Plates were blocked with 10% skimmed milk in PBS (blocking buffer) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Test and control serum dilutions were prepared by adding 21 \u03bcL of undiluted serum into 189 \u03bcL of virus or mock antigen diluted 1:10 in diluent buffer (2% skimmed milk in PBS). These sample-antigen dilutions were added in duplicate (100 \u03bcL per well) to the washed plate after blocking and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the RVFV nucleoprotein at a dilution of 1:2000 was added to all the wells (100 \u03bcL per well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (KPL) diluted 1:6000 was added to all the wells (100 \u03bcL per well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Peroxidase substrate (ABTS, KPL) was added to each well (100 \u03bcL) and plates incubated in the dark at room temperature (22-24 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes, followed by addition of stop solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulphate). Optical density was measured at 405 nm and the specific activity of each serum calculated by subtracting the OD in the mock antigen well from that in the RVFV antigen well.
