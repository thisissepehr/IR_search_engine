These 21 clusters were thought to be possible human-tohuman transmission or to have a common epidemiologic exposure. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of case-patients that occurred in clusters during the waves (6, 8 and 5% of reported case-patients, p = 0.62). Fourteen clusters were considered to be possible human-to-human transmission (which meant there were 14 cluster index cases and 15 possible secondary cases), 3 clusters were likely a common epidemiologic exposure, and for 4 clusters the investigation could not rule out a common exposure or confirm possible humanto-human transmission. For the 21 index cases of the clusters, 71% (15/21) were male and the median age was 49 years (range: 9 months-87 years).

This increase may have been due to early and increased recognition of cases, and further spread of the virus to other parts of China. Non-severe cases may have been more likely to be identified in the second wave because of the two week enhanced surveillance for all ILI case-patients in the counties or districts where H7N9 cases were detected [6, 20] . Some counties or districts detected a higher number of non-severe cases through this mechanism (China CDC, unpublished data). Another possible reason for the detection of more non-severe cases may be the strict monitoring of close contacts. If a close contact developed respiratory symptoms, the contact was tested for H7N9. These tests might have occurred early and if the contact received timely treatment this may have led to non-severe illness [21] . In addition, some provinces established their own surveillance programs for respiratory pathogens.

This may have resulted in a bias towards greater detection and reporting of severe compared with non-severe cases. Further, because detection required a medically attended illness, it is possible some cases were missed if the individual did not seek medical care. However, given the high awareness of this virus, it is likely that very few patients with severe illness were missed.

One serologic study conducted by China CDC from May to June 2013 found no seropositive cases of H7N9 among serum specimens collected from individuals living in a rural area of Jiangxi Province where at least one human H7N9 case was identified (China CDC, unpublished data). This finding suggests that infection was uncommon among individuals living in the same village as the case-patient and the virus may not be present in the community (or backyard flocks) but rather limited to areas where there is exposure to LPMs or commercial poultry. In contrast, other serological studies found that some individuals with occupational exposure to poultry were seropositive for the virus, but had no recent clinical signs or symptoms of H7N9 virus infection [22, 23] . In one such serologic study conducted in April and May 2013 in Zhejiang Province, 6.3% (25/396) of sampled poultry workers had hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers of \u226580 indicating prior H7N9 infection [22] . In a separate study among poultry workers conducted in May and December of 2013 in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, 36/ 501 (7.2%) and 56/375 (14.9%) were found to have an HI antibody titer \u22651:160 to H7N9, indicating a substantial increase in the seroprevalence of antibodies against H7N9 between the two different sampling periods [20] . Further, of 96 individuals who participated in both surveys, 52 (54.2%) poultry workers had a seroconversion \u22654-fold rise in H7N9 antibody titers from May to December implying serologic evidence of infection during the six months between surveys [20] . This finding may be explained by the duration and type of poultry exposure as well as exposure to other avian influenza viruses. Findings from these serologic studies imply that the risk of H7N9 may not be high in the community, but individuals with extended exposure, such as poultry workers, may be at high risk for infection, which is most often asymptomatic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 992, "end": 995, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1217, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1553, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1806, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "From our study we found that most H7N9 cases had LPMs exposure history, and in Zhejiang Province and Guangdong Province, routine environmental surveillance showed that LPMs were the most contaminated place by H7N9 virus, and the detection of H7N9 virus spiked in cold months [7, 8] , which was in accordance with the epidemic trends of the H7N9 in mainland China. And several other subtypes of human infections of avian influenza have also been detected in China, including H5N1, H5N6, H10N8, and H9N2 et al. Most of the infections also resulted from the live poultry exposure (sick/dead/healthy-looked poultry) or poultry related environment exposure, especially live poultry markets [24] (China CDC, unpublished data), which indicated that LPMs in China played an important role in the human infections of avian influenza virus. However, before such a drastic measure can be implemented, first prevention and control measures including the strict cleaning and disinfection measures should be taken in the markets to reduce the infection risk of residents, which is suggested in the national technical guideline [20] . Additionally, poultry workers should wear personal protective equipment when dealing with poultry to protect their health and also to limit the possible spread of virus. These measures should be evaluated to determine if they are effective in reducing transmission or if more drastic prevention methods are necessary to protect the health of the population. Further, we suggest that people avoid direct contact with live poultry, especially poultry in the markets. In addition to these control measures, studies should be implemented such as serological studies to understand the full spectrum of illness, genetic studies to better understand changes in the virus, perhaps household transmission studies to better understand human-to-human transmission, et al.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 275, "end": 278, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 279, "end": 281, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 685, "end": 689, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There is currently no evidence that this virus can spread efficiently from person-to-person.
