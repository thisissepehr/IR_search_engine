Normal adult mice of the A strain are fully resistant to MHV-3 whereas Balb/cJ, NZB, C57, and DBA/2 mice are all fully susceptible and die of fulminant hepatic necrosis (7). C3H/eBFeJ mice develop acute hepatitis which progresses to chronic viral persistence with focal hepatic inflammation and granulomatous disease (7) Although the disease produced by this virus has been attributed to direct viral cytopathic effects, these cannot by themselves explain the disease observed (8). It has been suggested that cellular elements of the immune system are important in both resistance to and propagation of the disease (9-11). The spectrum and severity of these diseases vary with age, genetic background, route of infection, and virus titer (12).

Finally, monocyte PCA, being a serine protease, could in itself alter the hepatocellular membrane with resultant hepatocellular necrosis.

These include the findings of viral particles within endothelial cells (35), as well as morphologic changes within these cells (36) (37) (38) . By the fourth day following parvovirus infection, cushion-like swellings of the endothelial cells were observed which produced focal narrowing of the vascular lumen. Following this stage, the vessels were lined by pyknotic desquamating endothelial cells or denuded endothelium. During the early stages of vascular obstruction, leukocyte aggregates were seen in capillaries and venules with plugs adherent to the vessel walls. Subsequently, aggregated erythrocytes and fibrin thrombi occluded the parenchymal arterioles (39) . These findings were noted in the vessels of the neural tissues but also in the liver and other gastrointestinal organs including the spleen and pancreas. Other investigators have demonstrated by immunofluorescence, viral particles within the endothelial cells with resultant vasculitis, microthrombi, and circulatory abnormalities (40) . In a study in patients with infectious hepatitis, deposits of hepatitis B surface antigen in endothelial cells and flow abnormalities were observed during the early stages of infection (41, 42) . These studies are extremely important in that endothelial cells are known to secrete a number of mediators which regulate the integrity of the vascular compartment including factor VIII, plasminogen activator, and activators of the contact system (43, 44) . Thus, injury of these cells could result in the activation of the coagulation system, microvascular abnormalities, and tissue injury. Reports have suggested that the secretion of mediators by endothelial cells is regulated in part by the cells of the immune system (45, 46) . Monocytes expressing PCA could induce endothelial cell injury directly by activation of the coagulation system or induce the secretion of other procoagulants which could result in further compromise of the integrity of the vascular tree.
