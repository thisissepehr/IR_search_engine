We aimed to audit clinical practices before and after introduction of a national guideline in Wales on RDS management. Anonymised, prospective data on all infants born at <34 weeks of gestation and cared for at one of the participating neonatal units in Wales were collected in two six-month time periods in 2015 and 2018. A national guideline was introduced in 2016 by the Wales Neonatal Network. Data collection included areas of antenatal management, delivery room stabilisation, invasive and noninvasive respiratory support, surfactant treatment and elements of supportive care. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to compare data between the two epochs. Comparing care before and after introduction of the national guideline, areas of significant improvement include use of targeted tidal volume ventilation, use of caffeine therapy, oxygen therapy post-surfactant and increasing early use of parenteral nutrition. Areas of poorer management included levels of positive end expiratory pressures and timing of introduction of enteral feeds. Little variation was seen between level two and three units, although gestational age was a significant independent variable for several practices, including delayed cord clamping, stabilisation with intubation, early enteral feeding and caffeine administration. A national guideline for management of RDS in Wales has significantly improved practice in several areas. However, despite a large volume of high-quality evidence and robust guidance, there remains a significant variation in some elements of best practice for RDS management.

However, some Welsh preterm infants born in non-participating units did not have their management audited, and there may be more variation in practice than appreciated. It was difficult to determine the number of eligible infants (denominator) for some interventions through the data collection process, although the majority of these were based on grade B and C evidence. We also did not collect data on other relevant clinical indicators like admission temperature, which may have an effect on the severity of RDS; this will be added in future rounds of data collection.

Likelihood of antenatal steroid exposure did not vary depending on GA or unit level. Timings of antenatal steroid administration were similar, with 70.7% receiving two doses >24 hours prior to delivery in 2015, compared to 70% in 2018 (p = 0.3). 11% in 2015 had a complete course <24 hours prior to delivery, compared to 11.7% in 2018 (p = 0.75). room stabilisation. A minority of infants in both cohorts received delayed cord clamping (DCC) (12% vs. 13%, p = 0.23; aOR 1.30 [0.75, 2.27]). The unit level did not have a significant effect on this practice. More mature infants were more likely to receive DCC (aOR 1.44 [1.23, 1.68]). Initiation of stabilisation of preterm infants is recommended with 21-30% fractional inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of infants managed in this way (76.4% vs 66.3%, p < 0.001, aOR 0.29 [0.17, 0.47]). This reduction was not affected by unit level; however more premature infants were less likely to be stabilised in an FiO 9% of infants required intubation in the delivery room in 2015, compared to 34.8% in 2018.

Among infants stabilised on non-invasive support, CPAP was the primary mode used in 92.1% in 2015 compared to 90.9% in 2018 (p = 0.31 aOR 0.53 [0.18, 1.60]). No significant variation was seen based on unit level or GA. A CPAP pressure of \u22656cmH 2 O is recommended; however, a significant decrease in the proportion of infants who are documented to have received a CPAP pressure Mechanical ventilation strategies. A significant increase in use of Targeted Tidal Volume (TTV) mode was observed (49.1% vs 79.1%, p =<0.001, aOR 7.94 [3.75, 16.8]). No difference was seen based on unit level; however more premature infants were more likely to receive TTV (aOR 1.14 [1.01, 1.3]). There is no standard ventilator model in use across the Wales Neonatal Network, but all ventilators in clinical use across level 2 and 3 units contain a volume-targeted ventilation algorithm. There was a significant increase in caffeine use between the cohorts (75.6% vs 81.9%, p = 0.03, aOR 2.49 [1.4, 4.6]) with more premature infants being more likely to receive caffeine (aOR 1.79 [1.45, 2.22]). Surfactant therapy. All infants who had surfactant replacement therapy received a natural surfactant preparation. Rates of infants receiving surfactant if requiring intubation for stabilisation in the delivery room remained consistently high (100% of 2015 cohort and 97.9% of 2018 cohort (p = 0.19)). InSurE (Intubate Surfactant Extubate) is a recommended mode for surfactant delivery. Of all eligible infants receiving surfactant, there was no increase in InSurE between cohorts (8.4% vs 7.2%, p = 0.97). Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) was practiced for 9 infants in the 2018 cohort. A dose of 200 mg/kg of surfactant is recommended; however less than half of eligible infants in both cohorts received this dose (49.5% vs 45.7%, p = 0.26, aOR 1.38 [0.77, 2.49]). The rest received a lower dose per kilogram of birth weight. No difference was seen based on unit level or GA. Following surfactant administration, it is recommended that FiO 2 should be reduced quickly. The documentation of this practice significantly improved (37.4% vs 57.3%, p = 0.005 aOR 2.16 [1.23, 3.82]). care. It is recommended that all preterm infants start parenteral nutrition (PN) and minimal enteral feeding on day one of life. PN use showed a significant increase (74.7% vs 84.4%, p = 0.001, aOR 2.75 [1.66, 4.58]), although more premature infants were more likely to receive PN (aOR 1.35 [1.19, 1.54]). Rates of minimal enteral feeding on day one remained similar between cohorts (32.4% vs 37%, p = 0.24, aOR 1.18 [0.8, 1.73]), and more mature infants were more likely to start feeds on day one of life (aOR 1.22 [1.13, 1.32]).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Table 2.\u2002 Summary of results. *Significant result, a p-value from Chi-square test, b OR from logistic regression model comparing cohort II with cohort I, c OR from logistic regression model adjusted for level of unit and gestation at birth, comparing cohort II to cohort I. d OR from logistic regression model comparing level 3 units with level 2 units, e OR from logistic regression model showing odds for every unit increase in gestational age at birth.
