The cells at the concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml were seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates; stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of concanavalin A (Con A; C7275 Sigma, USA) or 10 \u00b5g/ ml of Escherichia coli LPS (L2630 Sigma, USA); and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Culture supernatants were collected after 72 h for the measurement of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 cytokine secretion using commercial DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) cytokine assay kits (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
