            "text": "Intranasal administration of synthetic siRNA is an effective modality of RNAi delivery for the prevention and therapy of respiratory diseases, including pulmonary infections. Vehicles used for nasal siRNA delivery include established as well as novel reagents, many of which have been recently optimized. In general, they all promote significant uptake of siRNA into the lower respiratory tract, including the lung. When properly designed and optimized, these siRNAs offer significant protection against respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nasally administered siRNA remains within the lung and does not access systemic blood flow, as judged by its absence in other major organs such as liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Adverse immune reaction is generally not encountered, especially when immunogenic and/or off-target siRNA sequences and toxic vehicles are avoided. In fact, siRNA against RSV has entered Phase II clinical trials in human with promising results. Here, we provide a standardized procedure for using the nose as a specific route for siRNA delivery into the lung of laboratory animals. It should be clear that this simple and efficient system has enormous potential for therapeutics.",

We have described a simple method of nasal delivery of siRNA in the mouse model, but it can be successfully scaled up or down to use in other laboratory animals. 6 . To diminish any possible toxic effect of delivery reagents, siRNA can be introduced \"naked,\" i.e., without transfection reagent, which exhibits about 70-80% activity of the reagentcomplexed siRNA. It is best not to use polyethyleneimine (PEI). Although PEI is often used to form complexes with nucleic acids, mice do not tolerate PEI through the nose, although delivery through other avenues, such as intravenous, are well tolerated. In our attempts, essentially all mice died within minutes of inhalation of PEI-siRNA complex. New generation of transfection reagents are constantly being reported (12, 13) that may provide better delivery.",

Try to keep the total volume under 45 mL in routine application although up to 100 mL may be tolerated. 8 . The intranasal procedure also works in an aerosolized application. We have used small homemade enclosures in which the anesthetized mouse is placed and the siRNA complex (made as in Subheading 3.2) is sprayed by a hand-held nebulizer (the common type used as an inhaler by asthmatics). In this method, however, a larger amount of siRNA is needed because most of the mist gets wasted and only a small fraction is inhaled by the animal. To optimize cost vs. benefit, it is recommended that various amounts of mist and duration of exposure is tested and optimized for a given enclosure volume. If this method is to be routinely used, a commercial motorized nebulizer can be easily optimized. It is recommended to check with the local pediatric department for the exact model, vendor, and usage. Modify the system by removing the plastic face cup (or mask) at the delivery end and insert the tube directly into the mouse enclosure. Reagent cost can be reduced by designing a smaller face cup to snugly fit the mouse nose area.",
