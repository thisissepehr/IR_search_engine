This study examines whether hypothermia alters neutrophil integrin expression in a rabbit model of bacterial meningitis. Prior to the induction of meningitis, peripheral blood samples were obtained and the neutrophils isolated. Sixteen hours after inducing group B streptococcal meningitis, animals were treated with antibiotics, IV fluids, and mechanically ventilated. Animals were randomized to hypothermia (32-33 C) or normothermia conditions. After 10 hours of hypothermia or normothermia, neutrophils were isolated from the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stained for b1 and b2 integrins, and analyzed using flow cytometry. Cerebral spinal fluid neutrophil b1 integrin expression was significantly decreased in hypothermic animals. Beta-1 integrins can assume a higher affinity or \"activated\" state following inflammatory stimulation. Expression of \"activated\" b1 integrins was also significantly decreased in hypothermic animals.

We now demonstrate that hypothermia significantly decreases b1 integrin expression and activation on extravasated neutrophils. This effect is independent of total CSF WBC count or alteration in integrin expression on the circulating neutrophil population. In our model of GBS meningitis, we note the absolute value of extravasated neutrophils in hypothermic animals was higher than in normothermic animals, but did not reach statistical significance. We speculate this finding may be secondary to the model design. Meningitis was induced 16 hours prior to condition randomization. Animals randomized to hypothemic conditions demonstrated down-regulation of b1 integrin number and function. Integrin b1 on neutrophils are known to bind to extracellular proteins, thereby allowing directed migration. Thus, extravasated neutrophils in these animals may have impaired chemotaxis and sequester within CSF.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 310, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Alteration in integrin expression on extravasted neutrophils during hypothermia is a descriptive finding.
