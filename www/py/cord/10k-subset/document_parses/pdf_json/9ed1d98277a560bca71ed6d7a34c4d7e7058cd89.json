Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection. However, UV radiation degrades polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure could degrade the ability of a disposable respirator to protect the worker. To study this, we exposed both sides of material coupons and respirator straps from four models of N95 FFRs to UVGI doses from 120-950 J/cm 2 . We then tested the particle penetration, flow resistance, and bursting strengths of the individual respirator coupon layers, and the breaking strength of the respirator straps. We found that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance. UVGI exposure had a more pronounced effect on the strengths of the respirator materials. At the higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, by >90%). The changes in the strengths of the respirator materials varied considerably among the different models of respirators. UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps; a dose of 2360 J/cm 2 reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20-51%. Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.",

            "text": "T he possibility of a global pandemic of an infectious respiratory disease is of tremendous concern to the occupational health community, because healthcare workers would face the greatest risk of exposure. For pandemic diseases that may be transmitted by airborne particles, the isolation precaution guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) call for healthcare workers to wear respiratory protection while treating patients. (1) Because of their loose fit and low filtration capacity, surgical masks do not provide respiratory protection from small airborne particles. (1, 2) For this reason, the most common respiratory protection device used in healthcare settings is the disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). However, infection control procedures typically call for disposable FFRs to be discarded after a single use to avoid cross-contamination. This means that a pandemic of a disease such as influenza would require a tremendous number of FFRs to protect healthcare workers from airborne transmission. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) projected that a 6-week influenza pandemic would require 90 million FFRs. (3) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has predicted that an influenza pandemic would likely last 24 weeks, which suggests that up to 360 million FFRs could be needed in the United States alone. (4) A surge in demand of this magnitude would greatly exceed current stockpiles and production capabilities, and would almost certainly result in a shortage.",

            "text": "One possible way to meet the need for FFRs during a pandemic would be to reuse them, (3) since even a small num-ber of reuses would greatly expand the available pool of disposable respirators. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the CDC recommended that healthcare facilities consider extending the use of and reusing N95 respirators if necessary. (5) However, a significant concern with reuse is the possibility that the external surfaces of the respirator will become contaminated with infectious material and lead to disease transmission if, for example, a worker touches the respirator surface while re-donning it. To avoid this, FFRs would need to be decontaminated after each use. The IOM determined that no effective decontamination strategy existed for disposable respirators and recommended that this be explored. (3) A variety of techniques for decontaminating N95 respirators have been tested, including autoclaving, steam generated by heat or microwaves, ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and bleach. (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) All of these techniques have advantages and disadvantages. Heat and steam can melt or degrade the respirator and require drying the FFR after treatment. (10, 12) Chemical disinfectants require rinsing and drying, and can leave an unpleasant odor or a residue that irritates the skin. (12) Gaseous systems using ethylene oxide or vaporized hydrogen peroxide require specialized equipment and ventilation controls. (11) N95 respirators cannot be disinfected with alcohols such as isopropanol because alcohols remove the electrostatic charge from the filtration media and substantially degrade its filtration capacity. (13) Disposable respirators also can be decontaminated through the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). UVGI uses ultraviolet light to inactivate microorganisms, primarily by cross-linking thymidine nucleotides in DNA and uracil nucleotides in RNA, which blocks replication. (14) UVGI systems are relatively quick and easy to use, and do not leave chemical residues or risk exposing workers to toxic chemicals. In the lab, UVGI has been successfully used to decontaminate N95 respirators exposed to the bacteriophage MS2 (15, 16) and influenza virus. (6, 8) An important consideration for all decontamination methods, including UVGI, is the risk that they will degrade the respirator material, and in particular that they will reduce the ability of the respirator to filter out infectious bioaerosols. This is especially a concern with UVGI, as UV radiation degrades polymers, which are used in the construction of disposable FFRs. Some studies have looked at the effects of UVGI on respirator appearance, fit, airflow resistance, and filtration efficiency after one to three decontamination cycles and have found no significant effects. (7, 10, 12) However, the effects of extended exposures to UVGI after multiple decontamination cycles are not known, and it is unclear how large a cumulative dose of UVGI respirators can withstand, what damage eventually occurs, or how many times disposable FFRs could potentially be decontaminated and reused.",

For testing, 3-4 circular 37 mm coupons were punched from each respirator sample to obtain a total of 24 coupons for each respirator model. Four test coupons from each respirator model were tested under each exposure condition. The coupons were loaded into holders composed of two middle ring sections from three-piece polystyrene 37 mm filter cassettes (Part# 225-3250, SKC, Eighty-four, PA). The holders were then wrapped with black vinyl tape. This arrangement left both sides of the test coupon uncovered so that they could be exposed to UV irradiation.

The chamber was fitted with two 15 Watt T-150 254 nm UV-C lamps in a reflective housing and lined with black felt to minimize reflections. UV-C irradiance was measured using a radiometer (ILT-1700, International Light Technologies, Peabody, MA). Eight respirator coupons were placed on a horizontal surface so that the coupons and the sensor were approximately 6.2 cm below the lamps. A section of filter cassette was attached to the sensor head of the radiometer so that the irradiation of the sensor head would match that of the coupons. Calibration measurements using the radiometer showed that the irradiance of the eight positions varied by no more than \u00b14%. Samples were also rotated once among the positions when they were flipped so that the mean exposures for the different groups were within \u00b10.1% of each other. The respirator coupons were exposed to 0, 120, 240, 470, or 950 J/cm 2 of UV-C on each side (one side was exposed at a time). To expose the respirator straps, eight straps were laid side-by-side horizontally on a support surface at the same height as the sensor and each side was exposed to 0, 590, 1180, or 2360 J/cm 2 in a similar manner to the coupons. Temperature and humidity in the chamber were monitored using a humidity and temperature transmitter (HMT330, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). The mean temperature during coupon exposures was 27 \u2022 C (SD 1.7) and the mean relative humidity was 25% (SD 6.5).

The layers were tested separately because some layers are much stronger than others in the same respirator, and changes in some layers might be masked by other layers. In addition, the UVGI dose received by the outer and innermost layers is higher than the middle layers because of attenuation. Analyzing the layers separately therefore provided better information on the effects of UVGI on the material. The bursting strength of each layer was measured using a half-scale version of the fixture described in ASTM Standard D3787 (18) mounted in a materials testing machine (Model 5569A, Instron, Norwood, MA). Each coupon layer was clamped in a ring-shaped holder with a 22 mm central hole and rounded edges. A 12.7 mm polished steel ball was pushed through the material at a traverse rate of 2.5 mm/sec and the maximum force before failure was recorded.

(11, 12) The much higher doses of UVGI used in our experiments led to an increase in particle penetration of up to 1.25% in our respirator coupons, although all of the respirators had mean penetration values below 5% even after the maximum exposure levels. No obvious dose-response relationship occurred between the UVGI dose and the change in penetration, probably due in large part to variability in the coupons and the penetration test itself. These results suggest that UVGI could be used for respirator disinfection, but would need to be implemented cautiously, especially for respirators with a smaller safety margin between the actual penetration value and the 5% maximum allowed for an N95 respirator. It also suggests that each individual model of respirator to be disinfected should be tested, and that more testing is needed to determine if the particle penetration through UVGI-exposed respirators can increase to unacceptable values in some cases. The flow resistance was essentially unchanged after UVGI exposure for all of respirators tested, and it seems unlikely that the flow resistance will be a matter of concern with a UVGI system.",

At the highest doses, many of the layers had lost most or all of their strength, and in several cases the material was visibly degraded with obvious breaks or tears and came apart easily. This suggests that the upper limit for UVGI exposure during repeated disinfection cycles would be set by the physical degradation of the respirator material and not by a loss in filtration capacity. For some respirator models, this could potentially serve as a useful warning; if the respirator material is degraded noticeably after UVGI disinfection, the respirator should be discarded. The respirator straps retained most of their strength even at the highest doses, which suggests again that the degradation of the body of the respirator will be the limiting factor in the use of UVGI and not the degradation of the straps. We believe that the most likely reason that the filtration capacity and the flow resistance do not change substantially even though the strength decreases is that the amount of physical load placed on the respirator material during filtration testing (and in normal use) is much lower than the maximum strength of the material. Consequently, the respirator material has a tremendous reserve capacity of physical strength. Although UVGI reduces the strength and toughness of polymers like polypropylene, the fibers will not actually break unless they are stressed. (14) Thus, we think the filter layer remains intact and is able to maintain its filtration capacity.",

(6, 8) This suggests that, for influenza virus, dozens of UVGI disinfection cycles could be performed on respirators without the UVGI affecting their performance. Other pathogens require higher UVGI doses for disinfection (broadly speaking, to achieve a given reduction in viability, bacteria require higher doses than viruses and spores require much higher doses than vegetative cells). (14) For example, the UVGI dose required to disable 90% of a pathogen in aqueous suspension has been reported to be about 2.3 mJ/cm 2 for influenza A virus, 4.8 mJ/cm 2 for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes tuberculosis), and 41.1 mJ/cm 2 for Bacillus anthracis spores (which cause anthrax).

            "text": "Another important aspect to the UVGI disinfection and reuse of disposable respirators is the attenuation of the light by the FFR material, since this reduces the irradiation of pathogens trapped in the interior layers of the respirator. This is not a concern if disinfection of the exterior layers of the respirator is sufficient, but needs to be considered if complete disinfection is required. Fisher and Shaffer examined this question and estimated that, to expose the innermost part of a respirator to a given dose of UVGI, the exterior dose needed to be from 3.2-400 times the required interior level, depending upon the model of the respirator. (17) This suggests that some respirator models may work better with a UVGI system than others. The accumulation of contaminants on the respirator also can reduce the penetration of UVGI into the interior and increase the dose needed for disinfection. (16) A working group formed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs recently proposed desirable characteristics for a disposable N95 respirator designed specifically for healthcare workers. (19) One of their recommendations was that such a respirator be capable of being disinfected 50 times with each disinfection cycle taking less than 60 sec. Our results suggest that, with the appropriate design and choice of materials, a respirator and UVGI system could be designed to meet this goal. It would be relatively easy to design a small UVGI system that could meet the 60-sec cycle goal, while this would be extremely difficult for a chemical immersion, vapor, or steambased system. In addition, because UVGI does not involve hazardous chemicals and can be reasonably compact and inexpensive, such systems could be deployed virtually anywhere within a healthcare facility for quick and easy disinfection of respirators by workers after tending to a patient.",

First, we anticipate that the effects of UVGI on other respirators would be similar to those seen on the four models we tested, but if a UVGI system were to be implemented, the actual model of respirator used would need to be tested to Each data point shows the mean breaking strength for the respirator straps exposed to the dose of UVGI. Eight straps were tested at 4 different doses, with a matched control tested for each exposed strap (32 controls total). Error bars show the standard deviation. determine the effects of UVGI upon it. Second, we tested coupons of material in a standard filter tester, which uses a unidirectional air flow and a dry salt aerosol. We expect that the results would be similar for intact respirators worn by people who are exhaling humid air and inhaling air containing a variety of types of particles, but this should be verified.",

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is one possible method for accomplishing this. In our experiments, UVGI had a small effect on filtration performance and essentially no effect on flow resistance at doses up to 950 J/cm 2 , while the structural integrity of the respirators showed a noticeable decrease at lower doses. The strength of the respirator straps was less affected by UVGI than the strength of the body material. Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to disinfect respirators, although the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.",
