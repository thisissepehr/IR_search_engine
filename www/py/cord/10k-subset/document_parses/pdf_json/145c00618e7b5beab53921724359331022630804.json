We only recorded in the initial interview if participants had a history of asthma. We did not follow up on participants over the course of the study to determine whether the RV infection led to a diagnosis of wheezing or asthma or whether any viral nucleic acids detected using RT-PCR may represent the pre-syndromic phase of a viral infection.
