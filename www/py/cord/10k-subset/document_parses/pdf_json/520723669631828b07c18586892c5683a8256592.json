Aquatic bryophytes were sampled from 108 streams spanning over 3000 m of altitude in four regions of Nepal. Richness, cover and community composition were related to physicochemistry using multiple regression, DECORANA ordination and TWINSPAN. The performance of a hierarchically scaled descriptive model, developed in New Zealand for predicting bryophyte distribution, was examined in this highly heterogeneous Himalayan region. 2. Community composition and cover varied highly signi\u00aecantly with altitude, streambed stability and alkalinity, with evidence of effects of riparian land use on bryophyte cover. Cover was greatest in streams at low to middle altitudes with steep slopes (> 15\u00b0), high stability and low conductivity (< 60 mS cm \u00b11 ), where communities were dominated by two Isopterygium spp., two Philonotis spp., Mnium punctatum and Lejeuneaceae. 3. Richness, by contrast, increased signi\u00aecantly but weakly at high altitude and moderate stability, where streams were dominated by Eurynchium praelongum, Rhynchostegium spp., Fissidens grandifrons and Hygroamblystegium spp. Richness and cover were lowest in unstable streams at the lowest altitude, where no single taxon was consistently most abundant. 4. Although these results were similar to those in the descriptive model developed for bryophytes in New Zealand, subtle differences were apparent. Substrate size, although in\u00afuencing the presence of bryophytes in New Zealand streams, appeared to be unimportant in Nepal. By contrast, streambed stability was more important in Nepal than New Zealand, perhaps re\u00afecting pronounced monsoonal\u00afoods, and subsequent increased frequency of bed movement in the former. A suggested habitat template indicates that large plant size and vegetative reproduction may be responsible for the widespread distribution of some species, even into unstable Himalayan streams.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Headwater streams are perceived as harsh environments for benthic organisms.

Macrophytes are generally absent (Haslam, 1978; Sheath et al., 1986; Howard-Williams et al., 1987) , while periphyton standing stock is often low and transient (Suren, 1991; Biggs, 1995;  and see Stevenson, Bothwell & Lowe, 1996 for reviews). Aquatic bryophytes, however, are a common feature of headwaters (Glime, 1970; Sheath et al., 1986; Ormerod, Wade & Gee, 1987; Suren, 1996) , and may be the major autotrophs in these streams, contributing greatly to nutrient dynamics (Meyer, 1979; Steinman & Boston, 1993) . Bryophytes support high invertebrate densities (e.g. Percival & Whitehead, 1929; Suren, 1991) and enhance periphyton and detrital biomass (Suren, 1992) , presumably by increasing surface area, while reducing nearbed water velocities and turbulence energy (Nikora et al., 1998) . As such, aquatic bryophytes have important ecological roles in headwater streams, and may represent stable, persistent microhabitats in otherwise unstable ecosystems (but see Steinman & Boston, 1993 for evidence that some species have low\u00afood resistance). As a result of their temporal persistence and resistance to grazing (Gerson, 1972; Suren & Winterbourn, 1991) , bryophytes can be sampled at any time of the year without compounding in\u00afuences of community changes caused by\u00afoods or life cycles.

Low values represented streams with smaller substrates, and high values represented streams with coarser substrate particles.

In the present study, streams were not classi\u00aeed into similar erosion groupings, so direct comparisons could not be made.

The present authors believe, however, that the fundamental hydrological differences between these two countries helps shape bryophyte communities. \u00a7Water nature was not directly included in this study, but all bryophytes were collected from fast\u00afowing, highly turbulent areas.

Mosses were common in catchments composed of strongly indurated sedimentary rocks (e.g. argillite, sandstone, greywacke) and igneous rocks (e.g. pyroclastics, lavas, plutonics and ultrama\u00aecs); these were relatively resistant to erosion. Liverworts were most common in streams dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks (e.g. schist, gneiss, marble), which had a very low erosion index. Geological differences in Nepal were not directly examined, so a similar comparison cannot be made. As in the New Zealand study, it is assumed that differences in rock erodability exist between the different rock types encountered, so this may have played a role in structuring bryophyte communities. Geology is also known to in\u00afuence base-richness, and results of the present study showed that community composition (as ordination scores) was correlated to base richness (expressed as CHEMISTRY1 PCA scores). Dominant catchment land use regulated both bryophyte presence/absence, and community composition (of eighty-three taxa) in New Zealand streams (Table 8) . Streams that\u00afowed through modi\u00aeed catchments were generally devoid of bryophytes, whereas streams that\u00afowed through pasture, tussock or beech often supported mosses (Suren, 1996) . Liverworts appeared much more sensitive to catchment modi\u00aecation, and were primarily found in unmodi\u00aeed catchments dominated by beech and tussock. Bryophyte distributions in Nepal were regulated by CATCHMENT2 scores, where cover was least in heavily modi\u00aeed terraced catchments, and greatest in unmodi\u00aeed catchments.

Although substrate size is often equated with stability (Carling, 1983; Komar, 1988; Townsend et al., 1997a,b) , this may not always be the case. Large particles protrude more into the water column and are thus subject to higher velocities and turbulent shear stress than small particles, which may lie in hydrologically quiescent areas of the streambed. Additionally, large particles become mobile when random, high-energy turbulent eddies hit them, so the longer a stream is in\u00afood stage, the more likely this is to occur. Flow regimes in New Zealand and Nepal are very different, with New Zealand streams characterized by frequent, unpredictable, short-lived\u00afoods, and Nepalese streams characterized by long, seasonal increases in discharges as a result of monsoonal rainfall.
