The median SOFA score at the baseline was lower in the DEX group (9 [IQR, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ; p = 0.01). While the renal SOFA subscore at the baseline was similar for both groups, it significantly decreased in the DEX group on day 4 (p = 0.02). During the first 6 days, the urinary output was not significantly different (p = 0.09), but serum creatinine levels were significantly lower (p = 0.04) in the DEX group. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower in the DEX group (22% vs. 42%; p = 0.03, 28% vs. 52%; p = 0.01, respectively).

In addition, because the sample size was not adequately large to conduct multivariable analyses, we did not adjust the baseline characteristics. In fact, the initial total SOFA score and coagulation SOFA score were significantly higher in the non-DEX group than those in the DEX group. More severe coagulation abnormality might increase the mortality in the non-DEX group which was reported in a previous study [23] . However, at least, the difference of the initial coagulation SOFA score did not directly influence the evaluation of the renal component of the SOFA score, because the initial renal component of the SOFA score did not differ. Therefore, the results of our study should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating which should be confirmed through future studies. Second, our study was a post hoc analysis and applied multiple comparisons for exploratory purposes. The difference in the renal component might be due to chance. It is necessary to evaluate our findings in further well-designed studies. Third, we could not evaluate the mechanisms in other organs besides those included in the SOFA score. The SOFA score was developed to provide a rough assessment of each organ dysfunction; therefore, we could not detect minor organ dysfunctions using the SOFA score. We may, therefore, have missed identifying the mechanism underlying the improved outcome, besides renal protection. For instance, dexmedetomidine was reported to modulate inflammation or liver dysfunction [4] [5] [6] . Fourth, we collected and analyzed the data of absolute changes in each organ component of the SOFA score only in 60% of the patients on day 6 in both groups as shown in Table 2 . Because the data of deceased patients were excluded and data of patients discharged from ICU were missing, the number of patients' data on day 6 decreased. Therefore, it might not be appropriate to conclude that dexmedetomidine affected organ dysfunction in the DEX group.",
