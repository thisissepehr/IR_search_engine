Supplementary analysis accounting for use of rescue therapy-Data after the initiation of rescue therapy will be set as missing. The primary analysis model will be fitted to data prior to the use of rescue therapy along with all observed data for patients who do not initiate rescue therapy to estimate the treatment effect in the absence of rescue therapy because participants who were initiated on rescue therapy are assumed to have had a similar outcome to those observed with the same history and profile in the absence of rescue therapy (MAR). Since the rescued participants would typically have had worse outcomes than those observed in the absence of rescue therapy, a pattern-mixture MI approach will subsequently be used to explore the impact of worse outcomes among the participants initiated on rescue therapy. Imputation under MAR will initially be performed as described above. We will define \u03b4 R as the postulated mean difference in the rate of change of the PPPASI between the observed and rescued cases for each week post-rescue. For each participant initiating rescue therapy, we will then modify their MAR imputed observations accordingly by \u03b4 R. Imputed datasets will be analysed using the primary analysis model. Results will be combined across imputed datasets using Rubin's rules. We will repeat the analysis for a range of \u03b4 R corresponding to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of the change in the PPPASI observed in those with complete data over 8 weeks. For each MI analysis, 50 imputations will be run. These deltaadjusted sensitivity analyses will each provide an estimate of the treatment effect in the absence of rescue therapy, where participants who were initiated on rescue therapy are assumed to have had a specific poorer outcome than those observed with the same history and profile in the absence of rescue therapy. 2. Supplementary analysis accounting for use of prohibited medication-Data post initiation of rescue therapy and prohibited medication will be set as missing, and the analytical approach outlined above for accounting for rescue therapy will be adopted, but applied to individuals with data missing after rescue therapy or after prohibited medication use. 3. Supplementary analysis accounting for use of topical therapy-Where data allow, data will be set as missing when participants are on topical therapy at the time of the study follow-up visit. The primary analysis model will be fitted to data for participants not on topical therapy, along with all observed data for patients who do not initiate topical therapy. This analysis will provide an estimate of the treatment effect in the absence of topical therapy, under the assumption that participants who were initiated on topical therapy would have had a similar outcome to those observed with the same history and profile in the absence of topical therapy (MAR). Subsequently, data after the initiation of rescue therapy and prohibited medication will be set as missing, as well as data for participants while on topical therapy, and the analytical approach outlined above for accounting for rescue therapy will be adopted, but applied to individuals who are missing data from their time on topical treatment or after rescue therapy or prohibited medication use. 4. Supplementary analysis to estimate the complier average causal effect-For each participant, the proportion of injections received relative to injections planned (8 \u00d7 7 = 56) will be calculated and summarised based on the recorded daily adherence data. The complier average causal effect (CACE) will be estimated by a two-stage least squares instrumental variable regression for the primary endpoint (using ivregress 2sls in Stata). Here, we will initially define a 'complier' as an individual who complete more than 50% of the injections, that is, injections received relative to injections planned for the 8-week study period. Randomisation will be used as an instrumental variable for treatment received with adjustment for centre and baseline PPPASI on the week 8 outcome. Subsequently, we will alternatively define a 'complier' as an individual who completes \u2265 60%, \u2265 70%, \u2265 80% and \u2265 90% of injections, and we will employ the same analysis approach to address the impact of alternative definitions of compliance.
