If we can obtain satisfactory prediction using only nucleotide (sequence) information, it would be more promising. Three groups recently identified essential genes in human cancer cell lines using wet experiments and it provided wonderful opportunity to accomplish our idea. Here we improved the Z curve method into the k-interval form to denote nucleotide composition and association information and used it to construct the SVM classifying model. Results: Our model accurately predicted human gene essentiality with an AUC higher than 0.88 both for 5-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests. These results demonstrated that the essentiality of human genes could be reliably reflected by only sequence information. We re-predicted the negative dataset by our Pheg server and 118 genes were additionally predicted as essential. Among them, 20 were found to be homologues in mouse essential genes, indicating that some of the 118 genes were indeed essential, however previous experiments overlooked them. As the first available server, Pheg could predict essentiality for anonymous gene sequences of human.

Their results showed high consistency, which further confirmed the accuracy and robustness of the essential gene sets (Fraser, 2015) . These studies provided an in-depth analysis of tumor-specific essential genes and feasible methods to screen tumor-specific essential genes (Fraser, 2015; Hart and Moffat, 2016) . The essential genes screened by these three teams provided a clear definition of the requirements for sustaining the basic cell activities of individual human tumor cell types. Practically, these genes can be regarded as targets for cancer treatment (Fraser, 2015) . The data from these three groups provided a rare opportunity to theoretically study the function, sequence composition, evolution and network topology of human essential genes. One of the most important and interesting theoretical issues in modern biology is whether essential genes and non-essential genes can be accurately classified using computational methods. The models established in the aforementioned three eukaryotic organisms, S.cerevisiae (Chen and Xu, 2005; Seringhaus et al., 2006) , Mus musculus (Yuan et al., 2012) and A.thaliana (Lloyd et al., 2015) , involved intrinsic features, or intrinsic and context-dependent features. These context-dependent features included those features extracted from experimental omics data. However, the features derived from experimental data are frequently unavailable; consequently, this type of machine learning model cannot be extended to a wide range of genomes. In the present study, we addressed this problem in humans by using only intrinsic features derived from sequences, from which certain features can be characterized using a k-interval Z curve. The k-interval Z curve considered information of both adjacent nucleotide compositions and internal nucleotide associations.

Blomen et al. and Wang et al. identified the essential genes in the KBM7 cell line. We combined these two datasets into one gene set, KBM7. A total of 2073 and 386 essential genes were contained in the two datasets for HCT116. The 386 genes in this dataset were markedly different from those in the datasets for the other cell lines, so this dataset was excluded. Ultimately, 11 essential gene sets were obtained, corresponding to a single cell line. Essential genes, by definition, are indispensable for the survival of organisms under optimized growth conditions. Those genes are considered the foundation of life (Juhas et al., 2011) , and they should be persistent in a wide range of cell lines and species. Therefore, we only retained genes that were identified as lethal genes in more than half of the investigated cell lines. When a gene appeared as essential in more than six cell lines (11/2 % 6), it was selected as one sample in the positive dataset. According to this principle, we obtained a total of 1518 essential genes. We downloaded all of the protein coding gene sequences from the CCDS database (Harte et al., 2012) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi), and the annotations of protein coding genes were obtained from the HGNC database (http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/statistics, March 1, 2016), which contained 19 003 annotation entries. The essential gene sequences were extracted according to the annotations, and genes with no counterpart in the CCDS database were excluded. According to this criterion, we excluded 2 genes and obtained 1516 essential genes. We used the essential gene annotation in the DEG dataset, and the gene sequences were extracted from the CCDS because the former did not contain the information for non-essential genes. For human essentiality annotations in the DEG database, a number of scattered annotated essential genes aside from those in the 11 cell lines were identified. A total of 28 166 essential gene annotated entries (including conditional essential gene annotated entries) were obtained. Among these annotations, there were many repeated annotation entries; therefore, there were considerably fewer unique entries. To obtain a more reliable negative dataset, i.e. absolutely non-essential genes, we excluded all of the human essential genes annotated in the DEG database (Luo et al., 2014) from the list of the protein coding genes. The remaining genes were regarded as the negative dataset, and their gene sequences were extracted from the CCDS database. Genes with no counterpart in the CCDS database were also excluded.

A schematic diagram of the formation of these oligonucleotides is shown in Figure 2 . The oligonucleotide window S w slides along a DNA molecule sequence according to phase, forming oligonucleotide sets with base X, which is k intervals away from the last base of S w .

P(A) and P(E) are listed in columns 4 and 5, respectively. If P(A) is higher than P(E), then the group makes a higher-thanaverage contribution to the identification of essential genes.

Pheg's algorithm is based on the k-interval Z curve. Additional parameters are not necessary, making this server convenient to use. Pheg can predict whether a query gene (or multi query genes) with FASTA format is (are) essential using only the CDS region of a gene (or multi genes) as input. We integrated logistic regression into the Pheg server to estimate the reliability of the predicted results. Hence, this server can output a probabilistic estimated value as a measurement of gene essentiality for the inputted coding region. This is the first available server for predicting human gene essentiality. Comparatively, some computational models have been proposed for the other eukaryotes however all of them did not provide online prediction service. We re-predicted the genes in the benchmark dataset via Pheg and obtained an AUC \u00bc 0.9249 and PPV \u00bc 83.84%. A total of 612 genes were identified as essential genes among the 1516 positive samples. This means the number of false negative samples is 904 and tends to be a quite large number. However, this case is pervasive in the issue of essential gene prediction because the researchers try to keep a high TN proportion in order to correctively deal with a very high number of negative samples. Among the 10 499 negative samples in our benchmark, 118 ones were predicted as essential genes by Pheg. To estimate how many genes among those predictions are real essential genes, we calculated precisions using 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold and 20-fold cross-validation tests, and we obtained precisions with values of 70.43%, 71.63%, 72.48%, 72.22%, which were approximately 70%.

Considering that no BLAST program is embedded in OGEE, we downloaded the essential gene annotations (gene_essentiality) at (http://ogee.medgenius.info/downloads/) and extracted the essential gene annotation of M. musculus.

Two-sample t-test illustrated that the mean pLI values between those 20 predicted essential genes and those remained nonessential genes in our negative dataset is significantly different (P < 0.05), indicating functions of the 20 predicted genes are more vital. These results illustrated that at least a part of these 118 genes have higher probability to be factually essential genes and have been overlooked in the essential gene screening in previous experimental studies.
