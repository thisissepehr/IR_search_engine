Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Amino acid sequence of proteins is encoded by nucleotide triplets. The majority of organisms use the standard genetic code, with 61 sense codons translated into 20 amino acids. Therefore, most amino acids are encoded by several synonymous codons, which are not used evenly. This codon usage bias (CUB) can have distinct causes and consequences in different organisms. Two major factors are implicated to explain CUB, termed (somewhat ambiguously) translational (selection) and mutational pressure [1] . Translational pressure means preference towards codons that are most suitable for translation in a given context. Evidence for translational pressure towards common codons has been found in certain highly expressed bacterial genes [2] [3] [4] .Use of rare codons was hypothesized to slow down the translation rate to ensure optimal levels of protein expression and proper folding [5] , however regulation of translation rate in bacteria might rather rely on specific sequence fragments than simply on rare codons [6] . Moreover, it was shown that a synonymous substitution can result in a protein with different folding and different function, probably by causing ribosome stalling [7] . There are also reports of translational pressure in eukaryotes [8, 9] .

The latter case is exemplified by UpA dinucleotide, targeted by RNAse L [19] , which presumably resulted in reduced UpA content in, e.g. hepatitis C virus [20] . Another factor that might constrain synonymous codon usage, especially in RNA viruses, is the secondary RNA structure, either nonspecific RNA folding, presumably to protect it from intracellular defense mechanisms [21, 22] , or regulatory structural RNA elements commonly found in viruses within the coding sequence [23, 24] .

Host-dependent methods rely upon either total codon usage statistics for an organism and compare it to codon usage in specific genes, or upon tRNA abundance, which can be measured experimentally or extrapolated from the number of different tRNA genes in the genome [25] [26] [27] . These approaches have limited value in virology because tRNA statistics are available only for a few model organisms. Also, the native host of a virus is often not known, and virus replication commonly takes place only in a specific type of cell, which may have relative tRNA concentrations and codon usage distinct from other tissues [28] . In addition, viral infection can result in inhibition or activation of RNA polymerase III and thus affect transcription of multiple genes, including tRNAs, in an infected cell [29, 30] . The host-independent approach accounts only for uneven frequency of synonymous codons and is commonly expressed as effective number of codons, ENC [31] . This single number theoretically ranges from 61 (all codons used equally) to 20 (only one codon used per amino acid). ENC below 40 is commonly treated as evidence of a strong CUB. It is a robust and organism-independent method that is universally used to evaluate CUB. A statistical correction termed Nc' was subsequently developed to account for genomic GC content [32] . While a notable improvement over the original method, Nc' has its faults and limitations, especially in the case of short analyzed sequences [33] .

Python 2.6 scripts were developed for dinucleotide content analysis (dint-stat), sequence randomization and shuffling (cub-stat) (available at http://www.poliomielit.ru/images/doc/ enc-stat.rar). The difference between these two approaches is that shuffling moves sequence fragments (e.g. dinucleotides) from one place in a sequence to another, while randomization first counts sequence statistics, and then generates a random sequence aiming to reach these values. As generation of sequences is random, they never have precisely the same composition as the original sequence. A total of 1000 scrambled replicates were analyzed for each virus and each algorithm.

There are three dinucleotide positions in a codon. Variation of dinucleotide 1-2 is strongly restricted by amino acid sequence. Dinucleotides 2-3 and 3-1 may seem equally evolutionarily flexible because they both include the variable third codon position. Usually, a correction for either position 2-3 or 3-1 dinucleotide content is used to explore origins of CUB [37] . However, dinucleotide content varies between codon positions 2-3 and 3-1. To illustrate this, the frequency of the CpG dinucleotide at these codon positions was calculated in RNA viruses. As reported previously [36] , CpG dinucleotide was suppressed in all RNA viruses, albeit to a different extent. Relative frequency of CpG dinucleotide was lower at codon positions 2-3 compared to 3-1 in 26 out of 29 RNA viruses (Fig. 1A) . To evaluate the significance of this observation, extended datasets were tested for five viruses (Fig. 1B) . In four viruses lower CpG frequency at codon position 2-3 was statistically significant with p-values below 10 27 (Student's t-test). In influenza A virus there was an insignificant excess of CpG at codon positions 2-3 (p.0.05), which could be explained, for example, by different selection pressures in the mammalian and bird hosts [38] .

A general rationale for analyzing impact of (di)nucleotide bias on ENC is randomizing or shuffling synonymous codons in the original genome sequence whilst preserving the factor under study [37] . When shuffled sequences have an ENC close to the original sequence, the constraint (e.g. the nucleotide content) fully explains the CUB (or, in simple words, at that (di)nucleotide composition ENC cannot possibly be higher than it is). On the other hand, a difference between ENC in the original and simulated sequences shows the extent of CUB that could not be explained by the kind of pressure (nucleotide or dinucleotide) that was used as a constraint for the shuffling algorithm. Shuffling was preferred to randomization because it precisely preserved the positional dinucleotide content, produced sequences with more uniform ENC values, evident as lower standard deviation (SD) in sequences that were shuffled vs. randomized under the same constraint, and slightly lower ENC values than upon randomization (data not shown). Unfortunately, common statistical tests were poorly applicable to this approach, because all factors that affect codon preference (e.g. structural RNA elements) could not be accounted for, and therefore even a negligible difference in ENC between the original and generated sequences (e.g. 0.2 SD) passed a formal significance test upon increasing the number of replicates. As the standard deviation of ENC in scrambled sequences of a virus was on average 0.29 upon (GC) 3 correction, 0.27 upon N 3 correction,0.22 upon dN 23 correction and 0.21 upon dN 231 correction), and maximum SD in any virus/algorithm combination was 0.62, ENC difference above 1 was considered as significant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 321, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Consistent with previous studies [34] , ENC in RNA viruses ranged from 38.2 to 58.3.

This finding was compatible with ENC values in RNA viruses that were observed upon Nc' correction, which is also based on GC content [34] . However, the ENC in (GC) 3 shuffled sequences was higher than the original ENC on average by 3.5, but by up to 8.9, indicating that GC content imparity cannot explain all CUB observed in RNA viruses.

Another way to evaluate the effect of RNA composition on CUB is plotting ENC against GC content in studied sequences and comparing this to the theoretically expected ENC at various (GC) 3 content [31] . In RNA viruses, actual ENC was always lower than the expected ENC at that GC content, implying that GC content does not fully explain CUB [34] . Unfortunately, the formula suggested by Wright to predict ENC values as a function of GC content [31] is not applicable to distinct frequencies of four nucleotides. To study limitations of classic GC content correction methods and develop a better measure of genome composition, a data set of one thousand 10002 nucleotide (3334 codon) long simulated coding sequences with highly variable third-position nucleotide content was generated. Firstly, relation of ENC and GC content in simulated sequences was compared to viral genomes and to the theoretical prediction of the Wright's curve [31] . While the theoretical estimation properly described maximum possible ENC as a function of GC content (Fig. 3A) , it was not informative of a possible range of ENC at a given GC content in simulated sequences with extreme mononucleotide biases (Fig. 3A, grey dots) . In fact, ENC values close to 30 could be achieved at any GC content. ENC in actual viruses was always below the Wright's curve (Fig. 3A, black dots) ; however the result for simulated sequences indicated that this is not necessarily an evidence of translational bias. Importantly, the limitations of GC content as the sole genome composition measure equally apply to eukaryotic genomes, as mRNAs may also have uneven mononucleotide composition [40] . Next, ENC in the simulated sequences was plotted against the variance of sequence content characteristics (Fig. 3B, 3C, 3D ). Consistent with Figure 2A , GC content variance was a poor measure of sequence composition because it described only maximum ENC in simulated sequences, but poorly reflected possible ENC range at a given variance (Fig. 3B) . Variance of mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in simulated sequences provided a single measure of genome composition bias with a narrow corresponding ENC range (Fig. 3C, 3D , grey dots). Actual RNA virus sequences processed similarly (Fig. 3C, 3D , black dots) had notably lower ENC values than random sequences with the same variance of the thirdposition mononucleotide frequencies (Fig. 3C) . This was consistent with results of mononucleotide content shuffling that only partially explained CUB (Fig. 1) . When ENC in RNA viruses was plotted against the variance of dinucleotide frequencies at codon position 2-3 (Fig. 3D) , the values overlaid with ENC values of simulated sequences, implying that dinucleotide bias can explain almost all apparent CUB in RNA viruses. Also, consistent with shuffling studies, in few viruses ENC was slightly lower than that of simulated sequences with the same variance of nucleotide content, indicating additional sources of CUB. Therefore, variance of dinucleotide frequencies is a good descriptor of mutational bias and can be used to predict a range of ENC for a given genome composition. This and previous studies identified mutational pressure, and the third-position nucleotide content in particular, as the main driver of synonymous codon preference. It has also been reported that GC content affects all codon positions in plant viruses [41] and can influence amino acid usage in HIV [42] . A plot of e.g. C content at codon positions 1+2 against position 3 in studied viruses (Fig. 4A ) exemplifies that nucleotide content is generally consistent at different codon positions. A similar observation has been reported for vertebrate DNA viruses and plant viruses [41, 43] . A further analysis showed that genomic nucleotide content could significantly affect choice between compatible amino acids. The ratio of isoleucine (encoded by AUH triplets) to leucine (encoded by CUN and UUR triplets) in the viral protein sequence correlated with A content at the synonymous third codon position (Fig. 4B) . Similar but weaker correlation could be observed between the third codon position G content and valine (GUN codons) to leucine (CUN and UUR codons) ratio (data not shown), but not for the ratio between the third-position G content and poorly compatible arginine (CGN and AGR codons) and glycine (GGN codons) content in the encoded protein (Fig. 4C) . Previously, it has been shown that GC content in genomes of higher organisms can affect amino acid composition [44] [45] [46] . Our results indicate that this effect is maintained in RNA viruses. Therefore, genomic nucleotide content is not only the key driver of synonymous codon choice, but also a significant factor that defines choice between compatible amino acids.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 271, "end": 275, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 416, "end": 420, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 520, "end": 524, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1731, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3478, "end": 3482, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3525, "end": 3529, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3804, "end": 3808, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3809, "end": 3812, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4603, "end": 4607, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4608, "end": 4612, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4613, "end": 4617, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1118, "end": 1127, "text": "(Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1280, "text": "(Fig. 3A, grey dots)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1431, "text": "(Fig. 3A, black dots)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1856, "text": "(Fig. 3B, 3C, 3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1885, "text": "Figure 2A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2082, "text": "(Fig. 3B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2267, "text": "(Fig. 3C, 3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2341, "text": "(Fig. 3C, 3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2487, "text": "(Fig. 3C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2601, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2711, "end": 2720, "text": "(Fig. 3D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3626, "text": "(Fig. 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 4129, "end": 4138, "text": "(Fig. 4B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 4480, "end": 4489, "text": "(Fig. 4C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "correction in all viruses."}, {"text": "The concept of synonymous and non-synonymous genetic variation is central to evolutionary studies. Synonymous, however, does not equal identical, because many factors can affect choice of synonymous codons. In RNA viruses ''71% and 88% of CUB'' was attributed to mutational pressure on nucleotide and dinucleotide content, respectively [34] , which indicated the key role of mutational bias, but left a notable unexplained bias. A method that considered the impact of each of four nucleotides was superior to classical GC content correction (Figs. 1, 3 ), yet it failed to completely explain CUB in all but one virus. Dinucleotide bias at codon positions 2-3, but not 3-1, complemented notably to CUB in most viruses in our dataset. Overall, in 25 of 29 of the RNA viruses, mononucleotide and codon position 2-3 dinucleotide bias explained almost the entire apparent CUB. There is, however, a fundamental problem that complicates attributing dinucleotide bias to translational or mutational pressure. On one hand, in mammalian genomes there is CpG and UpA dinucleotide bias, and, consequently, NCG and NUA codons are relatively less frequent [47] . Therefore, translational bias towards common mammalian codons could produce secondary dinucleotide bias at codon positions 2-3. On the other hand, in RNA viruses there is also dinucleotide bias at codon positions 3-1 (Fig. 2) , which implies additional types of pressure against, at least, CpG dinucleotide. Dinucleotide shuffling at distinct codon positions presented here allows distinguishing individual factors in a complex interplay of translational and mutational pressures on codon preference. Negligible effect of position 3-1 dinucleotide content on ENC (Fig. 1 ) may be explained by the fact that only few dinucleotides are usually highly biased, and e.g. pressure against the CpG dinucleotide at codon position 2-3 would strongly affect the four NCG codons and produce a strong bias. At positions 3-1 CpG bias would affect sixteen NNC codons, and only when they precede GNN codons. Therefore, the apparent effect of dinucleotide bias at codon positions 3-1 on CUB may be many times weaker that at codon positions 2-3, and below the detection limit of our method.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1146, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 552, "text": "(Figs. 1, 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1374, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1719, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Results of dinucleotide shuffling at codon positions 2-3 could also reflect the effect of translational bias, which could have produced secondary dinucleotide bias and increased dinucleotide content bias at codon position 2-3 compared 3-1 in most RNA viruses (Fig. 2) .

In the mammalian host genome the CpG dinucleotide is underrepresented [48] , because in this context C is methylated and then deaminated, producing C-T transition [14] . This creates an obvious mutational pressure on codon usage and results in underrepresentation of NCG codons. Such a feature of an organism's own genome allows recognition of non-self bacterial DNA by TLR9, an innate immunity sensor for CpG-rich DNA [18] . In mitochondria, CpG is also underrepresented [49] , probably to avoid triggering TLR9. A similar sensor for CpG in RNA was predicted [38] , but is not yet known. This hypothetical sensor or effector could explain CpG 31 bias (Fig. 2) and also the dramatic effect of introduction of CpG dinucleotide at codon positions 3-1 on poliovirus viability [50] . If such a sensor was linked to translation, as, for example, translation-coupled endonucleases involved in no-go RNA decay [51] , it could produce codon position-specific pressure on CpG dinucleotide content. Unfortunately, due to the host CUB driven by host mutational pressure, it is fundamentally impossible to unambiguously distinguish translational and mutational pressure on CUB in mammalian RNA viruses using only a computational approach.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 273, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 362, "end": 366, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 618, "end": 622, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 671, "end": 675, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 759, "end": 763, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 972, "end": 976, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1106, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 851, "end": 859, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, dN 23 and dN 231 shuffling produced ENC values that differed from the original sequence by less than one in 25 of 29 viruses, indicating that we explored almost all types of pressure that affect overall codon usage. In three viruses (HIV, bunyavirus, rotavirus, and thogotovirus) ENC values upon any correction were still higher than ENC of the original sequence by more than 1. Therefore, additional factors are required to explain this residual CUB. In HIV, editing of cDNA by APOBEC3 could introduce additional genome composition bias [52] . One additional unaccounted factor could be the influence of (di)nucleotide bias on 6fold degenerate codons. Unfortunately, it is not possible to prudently evaluate such an effect. Randomization of 6-fold degenerate codons would inevitably rely on inadequate estimates in genome composition, either nucleotide content at codon positions 1 and 2, which is dependent on amino acid sequence, or the third-position statistics, which would produce changes in positional (di)nucleotide content. Shuffling dinucleotides between different synonymous codon positions, on the other hand, would ruin the positional (di)nucleotide frequencies in the genome.

It is obvious that corrections based on GC content are inadequate not only in viruses, but in any application, as conventional dsDNA genomes may have different genome composition biases for different genome strands [40] . As for dinucleotide composition, different codon positions should always be analyzed alongside, because they are affected by different kinds of pressure. Considering only dinucleotide content at positions 2-3 or 3-1, as well as combining different codon positions for analysis, can lead to false conclusions. Altogether, different shuffling algorithms allowed almost complete exploration of the correlation of nucleotide content and ENC in all but a few RNA viruses, but led to a conclusion that it is not possible to definitively discover forces affecting dinucleotide bias and CUB by only computational means. A number of additional questions remain unanswered in the field of synonymous variation in the genomes. Firstly, the origin of nucleotide bias that is strong enough not only to drive synonymous codon preference, but also to affect amino acid usage, remains largely unknown. Second, the source of primary dinucleotide content bias in RNA viruses remains obscure. Third, a single virus genome might not contain enough information to discover fine factors affecting CUB. Scanning window approaches working with an alignment of multiple genomes, akin to bootscanning, and the corresponding significance criteria, are required to analyze local CUB, while algorithms that properly address the synonymous variation in 6-fold degenerate codons and account for RNA secondary structure might further clarify the role of translation pressure.
