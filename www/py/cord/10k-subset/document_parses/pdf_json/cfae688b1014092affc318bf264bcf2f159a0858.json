When designing a gene construct, one must have a full understanding of the different expression elements that are currently available and of the strategies that have been successfully used to overcome obstacles in past. In this chapter, we discuss several major classes of expression elements that have been used for maize transformation, including promoters, introns, and untranslated regions. We also discuss several strategies for further improving transgene expression levels, such as optimization of codon usage, removal of deleterious sequences, addition of signal sequences for subcellular protein targeting, and use of elements to reduce position effects.

The first step of gene expression is the transcription of DNA to pre-mRNA, which is initiated by the regulatory element called the promoter. It is usually located at the 5 \u2032 end of the gene, upstream of the transcription start site. The promoter contains various sequence elements that function in the recruitment of protein factors that facilitate transcription of the protein coding region of the gene. The most basic elements are the TATA box and CAAT box, the names of which are based on their nucleotide sequences.

Promoters can be divided into three general categories: constitutive, tissue-specific, and inducible. A constitutive promoter drives expression of a gene in all plant tissues and throughout all developmental stages. A tissue-specific promoter expresses the gene in only a specific type of tissue. Tissue-specific promoters may or may not cause expression in all developmental stages. An inducible promoter only initiates gene expression under certain external conditions, such as light, temperature, nutrient levels, or in response to application of a particular chemical. In the early days, the 35S promoter from Cauliflower Mosaic Virus ( CaMV 35S ) was most commonly used to drive highlevel gene expression in plant tissue (3) . However, further study showed that the activity of CaMV 35S promoter in monocot plants is much lower than the activity in dicot plants. To improve its activity in monocots, several modifications have been made, including the duplication of the enhancer region of the promoter (4) . Another is the insertion of an intron found in various promoters of cereal plants. The intron is usually inserted between the 35S promoter and the initial codon of the transgene coding region.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "An Overview of Plant Gene Expression"}, {"text": "Introns that have been tested include those from the Adh1 , Sh1 , Ubi1 , and Act1 genes from maize, and the Chs gene from petunia (5) .

These introns are all quite long (about 1 kb) and located within the 5 \u2032 UTRs in their native genes. The mechanism of enhancement produced by these introns in improving gene expression is still not well understood. It has been generally thought that inclusion of an intron can improve efficiency of mRNA processing and increase the steady-state levels of mRNA (6) . Even though the activity of unmodified CaMV 35S promoter is lower in monocots than in dicots, it has still been routinely used in maize transformation, when combined with an intron or some UTR sequences, for expressing screenable or selectable marker genes (7) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Promoters and Introns"}, {"text": "So far, the constitutive promoter most commonly used to drive a \"gene of interest\" in transgenic maize is the promoter of maize Ubi1 combined with the first intron located in its 5 \u2032 UTR region (8) .

ProdiGene, a plant biotechnology company in Texas, has used the Ubi1 promoter to express avidin and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) genes in transgenic maize, both of which are used as diagnostic agents in molecular biology. In highly expressive transgenic lines, avidin constitutes over 2% of the aqueous protein extracted from dry maize seeds while the recombinant GUS protein can accumulate to 0.7% of total soluble proteins (9, 10) .

In their R1 maize seeds, compared with the nontransgenic maize control, the lysine content increased by 16.1-54.8% and the total protein content increased by 11.6-39.0%. Further analysis showed that the levels of lysine and total protein remained high for six continuous generations, indicating that the elevated lysine and total protein levels were heritable.

In rice cell culture, it has been demonstrated that the rice alpha-amylase promoter can drive high-level gene expression during sugar starvation (21) .

The cellular compartment in which a protein accumulates can strongly influence the interrelated process of folding, assembly, and posttranslational modification.

For these reasons, subcellular targeting must be considered in order to obtain a desired trait in transgenic plants. Targeting   Table 2 Sequence motifs that should be avoided in synthetic bacterial gene expression in plants (44, 47, 48) RNA In plants, it has been clear that entry of a protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by a signal sequence of about 20 amino acids, generally located at its N-terminus. If no further signaling determinants are present in the protein, it will be loaded into the secretory pathway. The default destination for this pathway is the intercellular matrix or cell culture medium (56) . In previously mentioned examples, ProdiGene used the maize ubi1 promoter combined with a signal peptide from barley alpha-amylase to express avidin and Trametes versicolor laccase 1 isoform in maize seeds. They found that expression levels of each protein could reach up to 2% and 1%, respectively, and expressed recombinant protein accumulated in intercellular space (9, 19) .

The degree of variability differs among gene constructs and plant species, but even expression from the same construct in the same plant host can have considerable variation. Random placement of a transgene, known as the position effect, is the main explanation for high intertransformant variability. Transgene expression can be influenced by the properties of the surrounding genomic DNA: the presence of flanking promoters, enhancing or silencing DNA elements, the copy number of integrated transgene, the chromatin structure or methylation status, etc. Today, there is no transformation technology that can effectively control where the transgene is integrated into the chromosomes of the targeted plants.

It has also been reported that certain MARs provide expression levels in transgenic rice that are higher and more predictable (65, 66) . However, the use of different MARs or SARs, in combination with various promoters, can have different effects on gene expression in different systems (67) . In transgenic maize, Sidorenko et al. (68) tested the effects of two MARs, one from the p1-rr gene and another from the Adh1 gene, on the variability of transgene expression when combined with three different promoters. Their results showed that these two MARs have no effects on the reduction of variability of transgene expression; however, the Adh1-MAR did modify the spatial pattern of expression driven by one synthetic promoter. In another report, Torney et al. (69) tested two MARs from the Adh1 gene, revealing new transgene expression patterns in roots and systemically induced variegation, but no effects on reduction of transgene expression variability among the individual transformants. So far, no effective methods have been developed in transgenic maize to eliminate the position effect that causes the variability of transgene expression. The only way to obtain high-performance transgenic lines is to generate large numbers of transformants, and then select individuals with the desired trait through sorting. In summary, the success of a maize transformation project is largely dependent on a construct design that incorporates the proper expression elements and strategies.
