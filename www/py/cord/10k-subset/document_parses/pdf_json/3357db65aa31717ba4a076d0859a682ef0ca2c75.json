Patient PC-3 presented with an intractable cardiogenic shock requiring ECMO to allow for organ recovery. Paroxysmal hypertension was identified in all of these patients following ECMO implantation. All of the patients in the PC group underwent coronary angiography. Patients PC-1, PC-2, and PC-3 had normal coronary angiography, which led to the suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Because of a 50% stenosis in the left circumflex artery, patient PC-4 was initially treated as having an AMI and weaned off ECMO support after 48 h under stable hemodynamic conditions. An episode of pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred 2 h later, requiring resumption of CPR and ECMO. Because of the extreme blood pressure fluctuations, a diagnosis of PC was suspected. Patients PC-1 and PC-3 experienced a severe lower leg compartment syndrome despite placement of a distal perfusion catheter to prevent limb ischemia. In patient PC-1, the femoral-femoral VA ECMO was converted to a central ECMO after median sternotomy avoiding further worsening of limb ischemia.

Albeit preliminary in nature because of the small sample size, our results may stimulate further studies on the cost-benefits analysis of routine screening of thyroid hormones, catecholamines, and metanephrines in patients presenting with acute circulatory collapse in need of ECMO support. Conclusions Successful management of endocrine emergencies depends on prompt recognition, correction of the underlying hormone alterations, and immediate treatment of shock. Unfortunately, numerous patients presenting with endocrine emergencies have an unknown previous history of hormone imbalance. Therefore, the screening of endocrine emergencies is important in these patients. Herein, we have shown that ECMO support is clinically useful in patients diagnosed with endocrine emergencies presenting with acute circulatory failure.
