However, since unnecessarily prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality [1, 2] , weaning from the ventilator, which accounts for approximately 40-50% of total ventilation time [3, 4] , should begin as early as possible. In order to provide structure and to safely accelerate the weaning process, a classification into six stages has been proposed [5] , with clinical parameters and tests (including weaning trials) at each of the stages that may help predict successful transition to the next stage (and eventually to extubation) [6] . If a patient experiences prolonged weaning [5] , undergoes multiple unsuccessful weaning trials, or has to be reintubated despite using non-invasive ventilation to prevent post-extubation respiratory failure, tracheostomy is indicated, often followed by transferal to specialized weaning and home ventilation centers [7] [8] [9] [10] .

Secondly, female gender, LTC-MP, and P a CO 2 on mechanical ventilation were also independently correlated with an unsuccessful first SBT.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The mechanical power of artificial ventilation describes the energy transmitted from the ventilator to the respiratory system. MP can be obtained mathematically by the \"power equation,\" derived from the original equation of motion, unifying all determining ventilator variables, or experimentally by analysis of the respiratory system pressure-volume curve (P-V curve) [22] . The energy transmitted largely serves to overcome elastic recoil and airway resistance of the respiratory system, although some dissipates into the tissue of the lungs and the thoracic cage, with the component dissipating into the tissue of the lungs believed to be responsible for the development of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [27] . In contrast, the pathophysiological basis for prolonged weaning is thought to be reduced respiratory muscle capacity [11, 12] , accompanied by increased load of the respiratory pump due to changes in the mechanical properties of the lungs (infiltrates, fibrosis, emphysema) and the thoracic cage (pleural effusion, increased abdominal pressure, and anasarca of the chest wall), that may be either reversible (by therapeutic intervention) or irreversible (e.g., due to pre-existing comorbidities). Patients' measured work of breathing (WOB) during spontaneous respiration, which is identical to the mechanical power generated by respiratory muscles, has proved to be a predictor of weaning [28] [29] [30] ; however, since WOB requires esophageal pressure measuring, the procedure is complex, impractical, and rarely used in routine practice. In contrast, energy delivered by the ventilator can be continuously calculated at the bedside and may be Fisher's exact test IPAP inspiratory positive pressure ventilation, PEEP positive end-expiratory pressure, DP driving pressure, VTi inspiratory tidal volume, BF breathing frequency, VE minute ventilation, MV mechanical ventilation, LTC dynamic lung-thorax compliance, MP, mechanical power, J joule, PBW-MP mechanical power normalized to predicted body weight, PBW predicted body weight, LTC-MP mechanical power normalized to dynamic lung-thorax compliance, VE-MP mechanical power normalized to minute ventilation, aBGA arterial blood gas analysis, SBT spontaneous breathing trial even directly displayed on the ventilator. Since the energy transmitted by the ventilator was found to be an independent variable related to weaning failure, corresponding to a state of chronic ventilatory insufficiency in the course of prolonged mechanical ventilation, it may at least be hypothesized, that at a particular P a CO 2, the MP transferred on mechanical ventilation would be correlated to a patients' WOB. In the present study, patients in the weaning failure group experienced significantly elevated MP values, mainly due to higher values for IPAP, indicating that with increasing MP, in order to secure adequate gas exchange, the likelihood of long-term ventilator dependency increases. LTC-MP describes the energy required to dilate the lungs and thoracic cage, and the present results indicate that this is crucial in prolonged weaning. In fact, therapeutic interventions during weaning aim at improving respiratory system compliance and resistance, thereby reducing a patient's WOB. In contrast, PBW-MP relates the transmitted energy to lung volume, which appears to be critical in the development of VILI in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [27] . Changes in respiratory mechanics in obese patients comprise reduced functional residual capacity (FRC), located in the shallow lower part of the P-V curve, and basal atelectasis due to elevated abdominal pressure, resulting in reduced LTC and increased WOB [31] . In addition, there is an approximate 1.5-fold increase in oxygen consumption even at rest with simultaneous excessive CO 2 production. This may help to explain the observed increased VR in such patients in the present study, equivalent to increased ventilatory demands, so indirectly contributing to the observed increased MP. These results are consistent with previous work, in which obesity has been identified as independently associated with failure of prolonged mechanical ventilation in tracheotomized patients treated at specialized longterm acute care facilities (LTAC) [17] . Similarly, in intubated patients, obesity is independently associated with increased extubation failure risk, and prophylactic use of non-invasive ventilation to reduce patients' WOB has proved to prevent reintubation [32] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 715, "end": 719, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 844, "end": 847, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1415, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1420, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3426, "end": 3430, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3690, "end": 3694, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4275, "end": 4279, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4500, "end": 4504, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Just as in patients with obesity, the presence of COPD is characterized by specific changes in respiratory mechanics, primarily bronchial obstruction accompanied by lung hyperinflation.

So far, this variable has been assessed in a single study, in which intubated patients with a successful weaning trial had significantly lower P a CO 2 values on mechanical ventilation compared to patients who failed the SBT [38] . In the present study, although the amount of ventilatory assistance (IPAP, DP, and MP) was lower in successfully weaned patients, they had lower P a CO 2 values on mechanical ventilation. In addition to the lower LTC, the reason for this may be the observed reduced VR, which is an expression of a more favorable ratio of CO 2 production to MP, necessary to provide adequate gas exchange. In weaning failure patients, in order to achieve comparable mean P a CO 2 values, it would be necessary to adjust ventilator settings further toward a higher MP (i.e., increasing IPAP or respiratory rate), and this in turn, considering the present results, appears to be associated with unsuccessful ventilator weaning.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Surprisingly, female sex was found to be independently associated with failure of the SBT and failure of prolonged weaning. There is no clear explanation for this finding; however, in one study, female gender has been identified as an independent risk factor for the occurrence of intensive care unit-acquired paresis, which in turn is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation [39] . In addition, differences in the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, most likely due to reduced lung volumes (total lung capacity and vital capacity) associated with both lower body height and female gender per se [40] , ultimately leading to reduced LTC in the present study, may explain the observed differences in weaning failure rates between female and male patients. Our study has several limitations. First, since this was a single-center study, the results are probably not transferable to other centers. Second, due to the difficulty in objectively measuring the amount of airway secretions and determining the type and frequency of different airway clearance techniques in a retrospective trial, we did not consider these important issues in terms of weaning outcome. Third, measurement of ventilator variables for calculating MP is ideally performed under deep sedation and muscle relaxation. Since patients admitted to the weaning center were neither sedated nor muscle relaxed, activation of respiratory or abdominal muscles cannot be ruled out without monitoring esophageal and gastric pressure [41] . This could either have led to an increase or decrease in VTi and minute ventilation, with a consequent distortion of LTC and MP. The same applies to activation of the diaphragm on assisted ventilation, although the proportion of assisted ventilated patients was low (16%) and not different when comparing successfully and unsuccessfully weaned patients. Furthermore, a simplified equation was used for calculation of MP in the pressure-controlled ventilation mode; however, this still seems to be sufficiently accurate for most clinical situations [24] and will probably facilitate application in routine practice.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 397, "end": 401, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 630, "end": 634, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1529, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2084, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the present study, the derived predictors of weaning point to a crucial role of the workload imposed on respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. Individuals on prolonged mechanical ventilation should not only be classified according to underlying diseases, but also by parameters that quantify the workload imposed on respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. Measurement of LTC-MP could be easily implemented in routine practice and may help clinicians in guiding the weaning process (e.g., to control the degree of daily extension of spontaneous breathing) or to identify patients at high risk for weaning failure at an early stage. Finally, LTC-MP may also be useful in intubated patients as a predictor of extubation failure or the outcome of a weaning trial and may help decision-making for prophylactic use of NIV.
