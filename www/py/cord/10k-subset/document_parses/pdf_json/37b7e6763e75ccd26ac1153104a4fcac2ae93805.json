A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) can cause shedding of ACE2 from the cell membrane. The aim of our studies was to determine whether ADAM17 depletes ACE2 levels in pancreatic islets and \u2424-cells. Dynamics of ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding were investigated in 832/13 insulinoma cells. Within a wide range of ACE2 expression levels, including the level observed in mouse pancreatic islets, overexpression of ADAM17 increases shed ACE2 and decreases cellular ACE2 levels. We provide a mathematical description of shed and cellular ACE2 activities as a function of the ADAM17 activity. The effect of ADAM17 on the cellular ACE2 content was relatively modest with an absolute control strength value less than 0.25 and approaching 0 at low ADAM17 activities. Although we found that ADAM17 and ACE2 are both expressed in pancreatic islets, the \u2424-cell is not the major cell type expressing ACE2 in islets. During diabetes progression in 8-, 12-, and 15-week-old db/db mice, ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 activity levels in pancreatic islets were not decreased over time nor significantly decreased compared with nondiabetic db/m mice. Levels of ADAM17 mRNA and ADAM17 activity were also not significantly changed. Inhibiting basal ADAM17 activity in mouse islets failed to affect ACE2 levels. We conclude that whereas ADAM17 has the ability to shed ACE2, ADAM17 does not deplete ACE2 from pancreatic islets in diabetic db/db mice.

Our laboratory has previously reported that gene therapy with an adenovirus for ACE2 expression, delivered to the pancreas, counteracts hyperglycemia induced by Ang-II infusion (3) . Pancreatic ACE2 gene therapy also improves glycemia in the obese diabetic db/db mouse (4) . Conversely, ACE2 knockout mice exhibit defects in glucose homeostasis and pancreatic \u2424-cell function such as glucose intolerance, defective first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and reduced insulin expression (5, 6) . ACE2 has further showed beneficial effects on various cardiovascular diseases, leading to investigation into increasing ACE2 activity by recombinant ACE2 or stimulators of activity (7, 8) . ACE2 levels might also be elevated by inhibiting degradation mechanisms, of which the most researched so far has been shedding of ACE2 by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), also known as TNF\u2423-converting enzyme (TACE). ADAM17 has the ability to cleave catalytically active ACE2 from the cell surface into the extracellular environment (9) . ADAM17-mediated proteolysis of ACE2 has been reported to be associated with loss of cellular ACE2 from neurons and myocytes (10, 11) . Compared with nondiabetic db/m controls, diabetic db/db mice have increased urinary content of a truncated ACE2 form, which was suggested to arise from shedding due to elevated renal ADAM17 levels (12) . We recently hypoth-esized that elevated levels of ADAM17 in diabetes might lead to loss of ACE2 from pancreatic islets by shedding (13) . We have investigated this hypothesis by quantifying the dynamic relationship between ACE2 and ADAM17 in 832/13 insulinoma cells, by assessing the levels of ACE2 and ADAM17 in pancreatic islets from diabetic db/db mice, and by determining the effect of endogenous ADAM17 on ACE2 levels in pancreatic islets.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 126, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 127, "end": 129, "text": "2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 309, "end": 312, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 628, "end": 631, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 632, "end": 634, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 818, "end": 821, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 822, "end": 824, "text": "8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1178, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1309, "text": "(10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1313, "text": "11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1517, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1655, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Rat 832/13 insulinoma cells (14) (a kind gift from Dr Christopher B.

Because the endogenous levels of ACE2 protein are very low in 832/13 cells (16), we transiently transfected cells with mACE2 and hACE2 expression plasmids. In the original description of ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding (9), the small size difference between intact and shed ACE2 makes it difficult to clearly distinguish between these two forms. To unambiguously detect whether shedding occurs in 832/13 cells, we also transfected cells with a plasmid for expression of a larger fusion protein with GFP attached to the C terminal of hACE2. The shed form of the hACE2-GFP fusion protein should have the same size as shed hACE2. A comparison of Figure  1 , A and B, reveals that an approximately 102-kDa shed ACE2 form from both hACE2 and the hACE2-GFP fusion protein is present in the cell culture medium after a 24hour incubation. A less intense band of the larger hACE2-GFP fusion protein represents ACE2 protein presumably released by other sources than shedding, which might include membrane debris from dead cells or small extracellular membrane particles that were not removed by centrifugation. An approximately 94-kDa shed form of mACE2 is also apparent and distinguished from the 102-kDa full-length mACE2. Increasing concentrations of the ADAM17 expression plasmid led to significantly increased concentrations of ADAM17 proteins with sizes of approximately 103 kDa and 88 kDa ( Figure 1 , C and F). The 103-and 88-kDa forms possibly correspond to pro-ADAM17 and mature ADAM17 (22) . However, it is also possible that both are active forms with different glycosylation patterns.

Despite significant changes in ADAM17 activities, there were no differences in cellular and shed ACE2 activities between mixed cell populations with active and inactive ADAM17 ( Figure 3H ).

With 25 ng pACE2-Tom per well in cotransfections, the level of red fluorescence was lower, but cotransfection efficiency was still greater than 99% (data not shown). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that practically all cells transfected with mACE2 will also be transfected with the ADAM17 expression plasmids and susceptible to effects of the ADAM17 proteins. Depictions of shed and cellular ACE2 activity as functions of the estimated ADAM17 activity of transfected cells suggest that saturation kinetics can describe the relationships.

The control strength for shed ACE2 is low due to ACE2 activity released into the medium, even when the ADAM17 activity is 0, suggesting that other enzymes or mechanisms contribute to ACE2 activity appearing in the medium.

The ADAM17 activity was at the limit of detection so there might have been small changes in activity that went undetected.

A similar lack of change in expression in ACE2 mRNA and activity was observed in high-fat diet-fed, hyperglycemic mice compared with regular diet-fed mice (data not shown), underscoring the remarkable robustness of islet ACE2 expression in the face of diabetic phenotypes.

G, The total cellular ACE2 and ADAM17 activities were determined at the beginning and end of a 24-hour incubation period for 832/13 cells that were cotransfected four times with 25 ng mACE2/pcDNA3.1 and 2 g pAd17 per well. H, 832/13 cells were individually transfected with 25 ng/well mACE2/pcDNA3.1, 2 g/well pAd17, and 2 g/well pAd17E406A. The next day, cells were trypsinized and mixed for coculture of ACE2-expressing cells and cells overexpressing either active or inactive ADAM17. We measured ADAM17 activity, cellular ACE2 activity, and shed ACE2 activity. I, The control strengths of the amount of the ACE2 expression plasmid mACE2/pcDNA3.1 on cellular and shed ACE2 are determined as the slopes of the indicated regression lines for the natural logarithms of ACE2 activities plotted against the natural logarithms of the amount of mACE2/pcDNA3.1. Data were analyzed by an ANOVA (A-F) and t tests (H). Due to the large range in SDs for ACE2 activity measurements occurring with the different levels of the ACE2 expression plasmids, separate ANOVAs for the ACE2 parameters were conducted for each level of mACE2/pcDNA3.1(\u03ea) (D-F). *, **, ***, P \u03fd .05, P \u03fd .01, P \u03fd .001 vs. pAd17E406A.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Figure 4.
