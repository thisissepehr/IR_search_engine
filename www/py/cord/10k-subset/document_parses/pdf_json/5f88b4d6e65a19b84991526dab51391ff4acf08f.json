The A (H1N1)pdm09 virus was the most prevalent subtype of influenza A virus isolated (66.3%), and as expected, all of these viruses were resistant to the adamantanes as were the H3N2 viruses. All 6 of the seasonal H1N1 isolates identified contained the H275Y NAI resistance mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir and possibly peramivir [22] . This mutation was noted at the time of initial identification of virus and remained stable in all consecutive isolates collected from those patients. Three immunocompromised patients were infected with influenza viruses that developed neuraminidase inhibitor resistance during treatment. One patient with an H3N2 infection developed a novel deletion mutation in the NA gene. The other 2 cases were A(H1N1)pdm09 infections that developed H275Y mutations.

Given the nature of a prospective study of immunocompromised patients, it was not possible to have extremely well matched comparator groups, but they were reasonably well matched ( Table 2) . Most participants were between the ages of 18 and 65 with a mean age of 25.55. This mean age of approximately 25 is consistent with the fact that the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was the most prevalent virus identified in this study, and that much of this study was performed during the 2009 pandemic and postpandemic period when a slightly younger population was more affected by influenza than during a typical influenza season [30] A number of significant differences were observed between the severely immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised groups. The immunocompromised patients experienced more hospitalizations, longer lengths of influenza virus shedding, and more severe disease and complications requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. These differences highlight that not only are these patients an important at-risk group for enhanced morbidity and mortality but also should be considered a group that could contribute to viral spread in the general population. The immunocompromised patients in this study shed virus for a mean of approximately 19 days, likely making them contagious for a significant length of time. Many of these patients were asymptomatic for a significant portion of the time in which they were shedding.
