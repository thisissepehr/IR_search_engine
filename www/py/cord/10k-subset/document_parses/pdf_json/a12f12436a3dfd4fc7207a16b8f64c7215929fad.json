In refractory ARDS patients'study, it was found that HT reduced metabolic rate and allowed successful ventilation with a very low tidal volume without an increase in PaCO2 and respira tory acidosis 25 . However, the therapeutic effect of HT is still under debate. Some studies have reported that HT can have beneficial effects in endotoxemic rats via modulation of the inflammatory response and attenua tion of lung injury 26, 27 . Kira et al. 28 also demonstrated that HT inhibits the adhesion, activation, and accumulation of neutrophils during the acute phase of ALI in rats and may have the potential to reduce ongoing inflam mation of ALI. In contrast, Torossian et al. 29 reported that HT increased mortality and impaired immune response in a septic rat model. Stewart et al. 30 also re ported that mild HT increased the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in endotoxemic mice. In our current study, we studied the therapeutic effects of HT in LPS-induced ALI rat model compared with NT treatment. ALT/AST (hepatic dysfunction), BUN/Cr (renal dysfunction), and lactate (tissue hypoperfusion) have previously been investigated as predictive markers of organ dysfunc tion. Our results show that mild HT ameliorates liver and kidney injury and improves tissue perfusion. Upon histological examination, we observed that lung inju ries in the HT group were less prominent than in the NT group. These results led us to investigate the mech anisms that are involved in these therapeutic effects of HT in ali. Functional genomics approaches provide new prom ising insights into understanding genemechanism in teractions. Actually, the expression profiles of miRNAs have been studied for several diseases, including dif ferent types of malignancies, acute myocardial infarc tion, congestive heart failure, type1 diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases 23, 3133 . In present study, the differ ential expression profiles of miRNAs in ALI rats with HT compared to that in the nT group permitted us to find that up-regulated 6 miRNAs (mir142, mir98, miR-541, miR-503, miR-653, miR-223) in NT were inversely downregulated in the HT group. In contrast, 2 mirnas (miR-323, miR-196b) that were downregu lated in the NT were upregulated in the HT group. We searched for biological processes related with signifi cantly differently expressed 8 miRNAs in HT using with DAVID. We also found that the dysregulated miRNAs in the HT rats were involved in the immunity and the inflammation pathways, as determined by the KEGG pathway analysis. Previous studies have shown that miRNAs may have a role in the immune response and inflammation in sepsis, or ARDS. One such example is that upregulated miR-155 and downregulated miR-125b is one of the pathogenesis in LPS-induced endo toxemic rats, and acts through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 stimulation 18 . Dysregulation of miR-146, mir155, mir181b, mir21, and mir301a were re lated to NF-\u03baB activation, which is an essential medi ator in the immune system 34 . miR-146 inhibited Tolllike receptor and cytokine signaling through downreg ulation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF 6) 35 . In this study, dysregulated miR-142 and miR-223 are involved in the inflammatory response by modulating interleukin 2/3 (IL 2/3), interleukin 6 signal tTransducer (IL6ST), IL-7, TNF-\u03b1/TNFR (TNF receptor) interaction, and CCL4 (chemokine ligand 4) in JAK-STAT signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The interaction of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-\u03b1/ TNFR is very important due to its position at the apex of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade and its dom inance in the pathogenesis of various diseases. More over, TNF-\u03b1 is one of the main cytokines involved in the response to lPS 36 . Thus, we hypothesize that the alteration of the expression of many genes involved in immune response and inflammation contributes to the therapeutic effects of HT in ALI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 337, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 560, "end": 563, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 564, "end": 566, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 581, "end": 583, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 812, "end": 814, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 919, "end": 921, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1982, "text": "3133", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2958, "end": 2960, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3284, "end": 3286, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3897, "end": 3899, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs in HT by KEGG pathway analysis showed that they may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis.
