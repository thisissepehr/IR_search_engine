Fluorescence microscopy indicated markedly different levels of uptake by the different cell types, with J774E and Vero cells exhibiting considerably more fluorescence than Neuro2A cells (Figure 4) . A quantitative analysis by flow cytometry showed that almost 90% of the each cell type took up PSCR-Fl. Based on the measurements of fluorescence intensity, J774E cells showed the maximum PPMO uptake, followed by Vero cells, while Neuro2A cells showed the least uptake. In relative quantitative terms, 10 mM PPMO-treated J774E cells showed an 50-fold increase in the MFI compared with the untreated cells. The increase in MFI was 10-fold in the case of Vero cells and 6-fold for Neuro2A cells. This relatively low uptake of PSCR-Fl observed in Neuro2A cells may explain the lower antiviral effect of P10882 in these cells. However, the uptake data do not explain the higher antiviral effect observed for P10882 in Vero cells compared with that in J774E cells.

A nucleic acid-based intervention against JE will face many challenges in its development. As one example, in most cases JE victims typically do not suffer the more serious symptoms of the disease until after primary viraemia, at which point the chances of a viral nucleic acid-directed drug being effective would be much reduced. Nevertheless, several factors encouraged us to carry out this current study. JE often occurs epidemiologically in temporally defined outbreaks, usually in July and August. Further, initial symptoms do overlap for a few days with viraemia. 2 Considering the impact of JE on public health, and the lack of effective drugs to treat it, we felt that the 3 \u2032 CSI-targeted PPMOs, which previously showed considerable antiviral activity against JEV in Vero cells, 12 warranted further exploration. The antiviral activity demonstrated by several types of technology that rely on sequencespecific targeting of viral RNA indicates that antisense-mediated strategies have considerable utility as research reagents and as potential therapeutics against flaviviruses. 24 It is also possible that a prophylactic treatment for people entering a region where JEV is known to be present would be of value. The P10882 PPMO targets the 3 \u2032 CSI region and was the most effective of the four antisense PPMOs evaluated in this study. A single treatment with P10882 suppressed viral replication significantly in Vero, J774E and Neuro2A cells at a dose shown to be non-cytotoxic.

Differential uptake of PPMOs is not the most simple explanation for this observation, as P10882 produced the best knockdown of JEV in Vero cells while J774E cells showed the best PPMO uptake. It is possible that there are differences in intracellular trafficking of the PPMOs between the cell types. 5 Previous results indicate that P10882 probably impedes viral replication by interfering with molecular events in the process of RNA synthesis, as PPMO blocking of the 3 \u2032 CSI region did not diminish the translation of WNV or DENV reporter constructs. 8, 9 The P10882 PPMO has the same composition as the 3 \u2032 CSI PPMO that afforded considerable protection in a murine model of WNV infection. 12 In that study, uninfected mice could tolerate a repeated daily intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg 3 \u2032 CSI PPMO, but a 15 mg/kg dose caused .5% loss of body weight in 5 days. An enhancement in survival of 50%, from 10% in controls to 60% for the 3 \u2032 CSI PPMO-treated mice, was observed. The authors concluded that the compound showed considerable promise, but that overall toxicity would need to be lower to allow higher dosing and hence perhaps enhanced survival. We observed a similar pattern in our study, with the P10882 PPMO producing a substantial enhancement of survival and reduced virus titres in brain compared with controls, when administered intracerebrally at a dose of 20 mg/kg. However, PPMO administration to uninfected mice at a \u226530 mg/kg dose produced noticeable ill effects or mortality. The peptide component (RXR) 4 XB of PPMOs is generally acknowledged as necessary for the delivery of therapeutically effective levels of PMOs into cells in vivo. 12, 13, 21, 25 However, the peptide has attendant toxicity in vivo as well. 12, 21 Clearly, the development of a peptide component of PPMOs that results in a wider therapeutic window for systemic dosing would enhance the utility of PPMO technology, and such efforts are apparently in progress. 26 -28 Alternatively, it is possible that formulation of the present (RXR) 4 XB -PMO would improve its pharmacological properties. In an approach similar to the study here, Yoo et al. 18 used a panel of HIV Tat-like peptides conjugated to a PNA targeted against a wellconserved flavivirus sequence in cell culture studies with JEV. Like PPMOs, PNAs interfere with the production of protein from mRNA by sequence-specific steric blocking of RNA as the mechanism of action. They found a Tat-PNA targeted against the top of the JEV 3 \u2032 stem -loop to be the most effective, producing a 5-to 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. Relatedly, Kumar et al. 29 showed that intracerebral injection of a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-coding lentivirus or lipid-complexed small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to a conserved sequence in the envelope-coding RNA protected mice from JEV and WNV infection. We previously demonstrated that a DNAzyme targeting a 27 nucleotide repeat sequence in the 3 \u2032 -UTR of JEV and delivered intracerebrally protected mice against lethal JEV infection. 30 These studies together indicate that compounds targeting viral nucleic acid may be useful to address JEV infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 395, "end": 396, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 648, "end": 650, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 651, "end": 652, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 788, "end": 790, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1624, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1760, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1764, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1768, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1771, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1836, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1839, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2051, "end": 2057, "text": "26 -28", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2235, "end": 2237, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2701, "end": 2703, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3123, "end": 3125, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although the core 3 \u2032 CSI sequence of flaviviruses is thought to be only 10-12 nucleotides in length, 16 a region of 20 -23 nucleotides in the region including the 3 \u2032 CSI is very highly conserved within the JEV and DENV serocomplexes. 18 The 3 \u2032 CSI region has been shown to provide a productive target location for PPMOs against a number of flaviviruses.

Obviously, intracerebral injection is not a relevant route of administration for human therapeutics, and it has not been established that PPMOs can traverse the blood -brain barrier. However, in natural infections, JEV replicates peripherally prior to invading the brain. 2 It may be that PPMO treatment could reduce peripheral virus titres to a level amenable to clearance by the immune system.
