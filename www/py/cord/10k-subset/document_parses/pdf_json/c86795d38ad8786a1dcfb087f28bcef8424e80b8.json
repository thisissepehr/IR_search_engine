Additionally, surviving chickens were humanely killed and dissected at the end of the observation period, and some chickens in the challenge-infection group showed tracheal hemorrhaging and hemorrhaging with heavy mucus exudate on their larynxes . The ciliostasis test is often used to determine the degree of tracheal damage following IBV growth in this tissue (Tarpey et al., 2006) . The results for the degree of ciliary movement in the tracheal epithelial cells at 7 dpc revealed that those IBV strains induced a severe respiratory disease and lesions in the experimental chickens, and the associated ciliostasis was severe, which reaffirmed that the trachea is the IBV's primary target organ (Zhao et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018) .

Although the mortality rates of all the IBV strains in this study were lower than those in previous isolates (Feng, et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2017) , the virus contributes to a high mortality rate when it is coinfected with other pathogens in chickens (Haghighatjahromi et al., 2008) . , and TJ at 10 6.0 EID 50 /bird.
