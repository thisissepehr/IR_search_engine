She was told over the phone to wait in her car at a designated parking slot. A doctor, dressed in protective clothing, came out and spoke to the mother. He then peered inside the car at the boy in the back seat of the car, but did not physically examine him. The doctor said that the Infections Clinic did not deal with paediatric cases (even though there is a university paediatrics department at this hospital) and referred them to the Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital of the Karolinska Hospital, a hospital affiliated to the Karolinska Institute. This hospital was about a 60-min drive away and the mother was expected to drive there. The doctor at Huddinge Hospital called the Karolinska Hospital, and told the mother that an isolation room would be available for them at the hospital. That afternoon, the mother and son arrived at the Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital of the Karolinska Hospital, and a doctor and nurse met them. The healthcare workers wore masks, gloves and other protective clothing, but no protective goggles. They tested the boy (nasal/throat swabs, blood tests, X-ray) but did not take his temperature. The doctor said she did not think the boy had SARS, but would treat it as such (i.e. a suspected SARS case). However, the mother and son were not kept in isolation. Eventually, the nurse said they could go home and explained that the hospital needed the hospital isolation rooms for other patients. The nurse advised the mother to wear a mask and not to see anybody until the laboratory results were ready. This advice also applied to the mother's son and 4-y-old daughter, but not to the grandmother with whom they all stayed. The attending doctor did not meet the mother again. There was no additional information given about measures for infectious disease control, or when any follow-up would take place.",

Because the doctors and other hospital staff now regarded her son as a suspected SARS case, the mother was concerned about returning home to her daughter and mother. The mother called her husband in Hong Kong who, in turn, called the doctor at the Karolinska Hospital to clarify the situation. As a result, during the drive home, the mother received a telephone call from the attending doctor. The doctor said that they were willing to prepare a hospital room for them. However, the mother no longer had any confidence in the hospital staff, and decided to return home.",
