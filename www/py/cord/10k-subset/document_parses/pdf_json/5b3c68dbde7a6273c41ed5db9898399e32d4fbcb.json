The disease persists uniformly if R c > 1 and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

The control parameters introduced are mostly functions of time appearing as coefficients in the model. The technique involves reducing a problem in which an optimal function over an entire time domain is to be determined to a standard optimization problem.

It is well understood that in order to eradicate an epidemic, a large fraction of infected population needs to be treated. Therefore, an upper bound of 0.7 was chosen for treatment control. The optimal controls remain at higher values initially and then steadily decreasing to 0. In fact, at the beginning of simulated time, the optimal control is staying at higher values in order to treat as many infected as possible to prevent the susceptible individuals from getting infected and epidemic to break out. The steadily decreasing of the v is determined by the balance between the cost of the infected individuals and the cost of the controls.

It is easy to see that the optimal control is much more effective for reducing the number of infected individuals and decreasing the time-span of the epidemic.
