            "text": "Multilocus electrophoretic methods and microcomplement fixation comparisons of serum albumin are used to assess phylogenetic relationships among species of uropeltid snakes, to infer aspects of their population biology and biogeography, and to evaluate their relationships to other primitive snakes (Henophidiaj. There is very good agreement between phylogenetic inferences derived from the electrophoretic data and those derived from the albumin immunological data. Protein variation detected by electrophoresis is relatively high among 17 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) examined. The mean number of alleles per locus (5.1 across all OTUs), levels of polymorphism (25% of loci), and heterozygosity (4-6%), are typical of, or greater than, values reported for other snakes. Species of uropeltids are genetically highly differentiated, as measured by genetic distances (lowest interspecific Nei's unbiased genetic distances, 0.22-0.27 among several Sri Lankan species; 2.3 between Teretrurus of India and other uropeltines). The phylogenetic tree most consistent with both the immunological and electrophoretic data shows uropeltines from Sri Lanka to be monophyletic, but the Indian species are paraphyletic with respect to those from Sri Lanka. Rhinophis travancoricus of India is inferred to be the sister taxon to the Sri Lankan radiation. As the genera are presently understood, neither Rhinophis nor Uropeltis appears to be monophyletic. A biogeographic scenario derived from the phylogenetic hypothesis suggests an early diversification of uropeltids in India, followed by a single invasion into the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Subsequent evolution on Sri Lanka resulted in occupation of montane biotopes. Cylindrophic is the sister group to uropeltines and is considered a member of the Uropeltidae. 'The immunological data indicate no phylogenetic association between uropeltids and other 'anilioid' taxa, specifically Anilius, Loxocemus or Xenopeltis, although we cannot rule out a very remote relationship. We specifically reject the hypothesis that uropeltines and scolecophidians form a cladc relative to henophidians. High levels of genetic variation and a trend toward negative f i i S values for polymorphic loci in three populations 293 002&4066/90/070293 + 28 003.00/0 INTRODUCTION The evolution and biogeography of the biota of India and Sri Lanka has been of long-standing interest in evolutionary biology (e.g. Blanford, 1901) . Of the many biotic elements characteristic of this region, one of the more unusual is a group of specialized, but primitive, snakes commonly placed in their own family, the Uropeltidae. Comprising about 30 species in India and 15 in Sri Lanka, there are currently eight recognized genera (Smith, 1943; Gans, 1966; Rajendran, 1985) . Two genera (Rhinophis and Uropeltis) have been recorded from both India and Sri Lanka, one (Pseudotyphlops) is endemic to Sri Lanka, and the remaining genera (Brachyophidium, Melanophidium, Platyplectrurus, Plectrurus, and Teretrurus) are endemic to India. The possible existence of a single species of Platyplectrurus in both areas seems to have been based on an erroneous record (De Silva, 1980) . Numerous aspects of the morphology and biology of uropeltids are unusual. The structure of the occipito-atlas joint is unique among amniotes (Williams, 1959) . They are burrowers, some species with the caudal tip modified into a blunt rough surface that accumulates a plug of soil and hence blocks the tunnel posteriorly (Gans, 1976; Gans & Baic, 1977) . The axial musculature has numerous unusual biochemical and morphological properties associated with burrowing (Gans, Dessauer & Baic, 1978) . What little is known about the general biology of the various species has been summarized by Gans (1976 Gans ( , 1987 and Rajendran (1985) .",

The latter includes a single species (C. rnaculatus) endemic to Sri Lanka, and broader phylogenetic context of the Henophidia, our present data are suggestive concerning questions such as the monophyly of the Anilioidea. We infer aspects of uropeltine biogeographic history, and make suggestions for a revised taxonomy which is now in preparation. Finally, we interpret the measures of biochemical polymorphism with respect to aspects of population size and structure (e.g. Wright, 1978) , features that have been especially difficult to study in secretive organisms such as uropeltids, and examine some aspects of comparative protein evolution in the group.",

Samples of heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and blood were collected from freshly killed snakes. Plasma was separated from blood cells and all tissues were frozen immediately. Until required for experimental work, tissues were maintained in the frozen tissue collection at the L.S.U. Medical Center in New Orleans. Methods of tissue storage and curation have been described (Dessauer & Hafner, 1984) . The sample of Uropeltis ceylanicus used in the immunological study was whole blood preserved in the field in phenoxyethanol-phosphate-sucrose (Nakanishi et al., 1969) . The biochemical analyses were performed blind in that neither localities nor species identifications were initially made available. Specimens utilized, their collecting sites, and voucher numbers are listed in Appendix 1. Two species of Rhinophis, designated sp. 1 and sp. 2, will be described in forthcoming systematic papers. Sample sizes are small (1-3) for taxa except Rhinophis philippinus (51 individuals of two populations), R. drurnrnondhayi (lo), and R. blythii (6). Because uropeltine species are well-differentiated electrophoretically (see following), the small sample sizes should be adequate for calculating genetic variability and distances, and for estimating phylogenetic relationships (Gorman & Renzi, 1979 ; see also Hillis, 1987) .",

Significance of the F,, values was tested by the statistic (FIS)'N, where N is the sample size, with one degree of freedom in a chi-square distribution (Li & Horvitz, 1953) . We used Wright's ( 1978) modification of Rodgers ' ( 1972) genetic distance (DR) and Nei's (1978) unbiased genetic distance (DJ, which corrects for small sample sizes, for expressing the degree of divergence among populations. The standard errors of these distance estimates are large because heterozygosities are also high for at least some species. For these reasons, our estimate of relationships among these species based on genetic distances should be considered provisional. We are encouraged, however, by the general congruence between the pattern of relationships indicated by the analysis of genetic distances, by a qualitative character analysis of the allozyme data, and by the analysis of the albumin immunological data.",

Because we lacked data for albumin and transferrin in Rhinophis travancoricus, we analysed the genetic distance data in two ways, first by deleting these two loci from the data matrix and including all taxa in the analysis; second, by deleting R. travancoricus from the analysis and analysing the complete set of loci for other OTUs. The results of both analyses were very similar. The trees were rooted using Cylindrophis maculatus as an outgroup (confirmed by both morphological studies and by the immunological data of this study).

Except for R. philippinus, albumins were isolated by their precipitation from plasma or muscle (Leptotyphlops humilis only) using rivanol (6,9-diarnino-Z-ethoxyacridine lactate) followed by vertical slab polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as detailed by Cadle ( 1988) . Albumin of R. philippinus was isolated directly from plasma by PAGE. Albumins were identified on gels by their fluorescence in the presence of 8-anilino-lnaphthalene sulphonate. Fluorescing bands were cut from the gel and eluted in isotris buffer (Champion et al., 1974) . Antisera were induced in Dutch Belted rabbits (three per albumin) over a 13-week-period following the schedule of Maxson, Highton & Wake (1979) . Individual antisera were pooled in inverse proportion to their microcomplement fixation (MC'F) titers; titers for these pooled antisera ranged from 1800 (Rhinophis) to 6000 (Boa), with an average of 4000. In immunodiffusion tests against whole plasma, pooled antisera except that for Rhinophis showed single precipitin arcs. The antiserum to Rhinophis showed a minor secondary arc in addition to the major albumin arc. However, in MC'F experiments against whole plasma and purified albumins, no differences in titration curves were observed for plasma and albumins, indicating that the secondary component in this antiserum had no measurable effect on the albumin immunological distances (AIDS) obtained. With few exceptions noted in Table 7 , immunodiffusion and MC'F experiments were carried out using pooled antisera according to protocols outlined in Champion et al. (1974) .",

Interpretations of the large distances (Table 7) are made difficult by two factors. First, most comparisons involving Anilius, Loxocemus and Xenopellis are a t the upper limit of resolving power of the MC'F technique. Second, the large distances make it difficult to use outgroups to perform relative rate tests, which are necessary for the phyiogenetic interpretation of immunological data (Cadle, 1988; Dessauer et al., 1987) . The most appropriate outgroup with which to perform rate tests for these taxa is the Scolecophidia, but these comparisons are rendered very difficult because of the distances involved (Table 6 ). Lacking a well-corroborated phylogeny of henophidian taxa (itself a paraphyletic group; see, e.g. Groombridge, 1979) makes other possible outgroup comparisons difficult to justify at the present time. However, we have seen no indications in our immunological data thus far that Anilius, Loxocemus or Xenopeltis is especially divergent with regard to its rate of albumin evolution. Thus, we interpret these data as indicating no particular phylogenetic association between uropeltids and other 'anilioid' taxa (Anilius, Loxocemus, Xenopeltis) . That is, a clade of anilioid taxa is not suggested by our data, other than the uropeltine-Cylindrophis association already mentioned. Some aspects of our data, such as the relatively low immunological distances between Cylindrophis and Loxocemus and Xenopeltis (Table 7) require further investigation once we have a more comprehensive understanding of albumin evolution in henophidians. The great albumin immunological distances involved here suggest that other methods may be more appropriate for developing a molecular phylogeny for these ancient lineages.",

As already indicated, our data suggest a sister-group relationship between uropeltines and Cylindrophis, as corroborated by numerous morphological features. We did not attempt MC'F comparisons to uropeltines using the antiserum to Leptopphlops albumin because antigen samples were in short supply. However, numerous enhanced Ouchterlony immunodiffusion tests (Dessauer et al., 1987) comparing henophidian albumins suggest that the MC'F immunological distances between Leptogphlops and uropeltines are greater than 150. Thus, we consider Cylindrophis and uropeltines relative to the three taxa for which we have antisera (Rhinophisphilippinus, Cyliadrophis rufus, and Boa constrictor). The relative rate tests in Table 7 were used to interpret major patterns of branching. The position of Teretrurus is left unresolved, as we lack an antiserum to any Indian species and cannot determine whether there is a clade comprising Teeretrurus and Uropeltis from India, or whether Teretrurus diverged earlier from the common uropeltine lineage (see text).",

Our data confirm this hypothesis and demonstrate a great degree of molecular differentiation between the uropeltines and their sister group, Cylindrophis. Indeed, the genetic differentiation among species of uropeltines as indicated by both allozymes and albumin immunology suggests an old radiation with extant forms being the result of speciation events extending into the remote past. Under this view some of the morphological peculiarities of uropeltines as a group must be seen as specializations that arose very early in the history of the lineage and have since undergone little anagenetic change. In this context, it would be most interesting to obtain data bearing on the phylogenetic position of Melanophidium, Pla~plectrurus, Plectrurus and Brachyophidium, as these are restricted to India where the most ancient divergences among uropeltines possibly are (see below).",

            "text": "Analysis of the allozyme data using FREQPARS resulted in three more or less equally parsimonious trees (Figs 2, 3) , but they differ substantially in branching order from one another. Although rigid adherence to the parsimony criterion would result in choosing the tree of Fig. 3A as the best supported (shortest) tree, we do not feel that this is necessarily justified by consideration of the albumin immunological data (Table 7 and Fig. 4) , which are more in agreement with the topology of the Distance Wagner tree shown in Fig. 2 . Optimization of this tree by the FREQPARS algorithm results in a length only 0.7 steps shorter than the most parsimonious tree examined. If we use the trees in Fig. 3 as predictions concerning albumin evolution in uropeltids, then the albumins of Uropeltis melanogaster or Rhinophis oxyrhynchus should be very divergent from all other uropeltines. This prediction is not substantiated. Table 7 shows that both of these species are very close to Rhinophis philippinus (AIDS 10 and 8), and that neither has especially divergent albumins when compared to the outgroups, Cylindrophis and Boa. Thus, these rate-controlled immunological data are inconsistent with both of the trees in Fig. 3 , but are consistent with the tree in Fig. 2 . We therefore consider the tree in Fig. 2 as the best-supported by these criteria, even though slightly longer than the most parsimonious topology discovered. Concerning broad patterns of uropeltine phylogeny this tree (Fig. 2) suggests the monophyly of the Sri Lankan uropeltines, but a more ancient series of cladogenetic events among Indian species. Details of relationships among species of uropeltines are not fully resolved by these data, as the immunological data involve too few reciprocal comparisons and the allozyme data are equivocal in several respects. However, several clusters of species common to all of the analyses of the allozyme data (Figs 2, 3) , enumerated above, reflect strongly-supported components by these data. One such cluster involves R. blythii-R. drummondhay-Rhinophis sp. 1-Rhinophis sp. 2 (Figs 2, 3A), with perhaps R. trevelyanus also joining this group (Fig. 3B) .",

Our data do not indicate a monophyletic clade of Indian species, but rather, they suggest a series of speciation events giving rise to the present diversity in India and a clade which subsequently gave rise to all Sri Lankan species. Among the taxa that we examined, Rhinophis travancoricus is the sister taxon to the Sri Lankan radiation. We emphasize that this pattern could be modified upon examination of the other species of Sri Lankan uropeltines, but these comprise only three species of Rhinophis and one of Uropeltis. All species of these genera from Sri Lanka appear closely related by both allozyme and immunological criteria. A more complex relationship, not evaluated in this study, may also result once the genera endemic to India can be incorporated into the phylogeny. This may not change our inference that the Sri Lankan uropeltines are a clade, but may result in an expanded view of that clade, and will certainly bear on interpretations of the evolution and biogeography of the Indian forms.",

The immunological data presented here, unpublished MC'F comparisons, and extensive Ouchterlony immunodiffusion comparisons of snake albumins, do not indicate a clade comprising uropeltids (sensu lato) and other taxa often grouped with them as the Anilioidea or the Aniliidae (see Table I ) , referred to hereafter as Anilioidea. This is especially true of Anilius, which is often viewed as the sister taxon to either Cylindrophis or Cylindrophis-uropeltines (e.g. Rieppel, 1977 Rieppel, , 1979a Groombridge, 1979; Hoffstetter & Rage, 1977) . Rieppel (1977 Rieppel ( , 1979c , Groombridge (1979), and McDowell (1987) pointed out that many of the features characterizing the Anilioidea are primitive, rendering that taxon paraphyletic. Although we have not yet developed a comprehensive phylogeny of henophidians based on the immunological data, our present results lend no support to the concept of a clade comprising uropeltids (sensu lato) and any of the other anilioid taxa. Until the relationships of these taxa are further resolved, we suggest that biogeographic and evolutionary syntheses (e.g. Cracraft, 1974; Hoffstetter & Rage, 1977; Rage, 1981; Rieppel, 197910) that are dependent on a monophyletic Anilioidea (or Aniliidae if uropeltids are considered the sister group to Anilius) are premature. Such resolution also will bear ultimately on the systematic placement of a large number of 'aniliid' fossil vertebrae known from North America, South America and Europe (Hoffstetter & Rage, 1977; Rage, 1981 Rage, , 1987 Bailon, 1988) .",

Our recognition of a clade comprising all Sri Lankan species of uropeltines, and the present range disjunction between the Sri Lankan species, Cylindrophis maculatus, and its congeners invite a consideration of the possible biogeographic history of these units. Many Indian species of uropeltines are upland species occurring in moist montane forests (Rajendran, 1985) . O n Sri Lanka, species of uropeltids occur along the eastern coast and others range into the central highlands, with Cylindrophis maculatus ranging across moist lowlands into the low mountains (Bachman, 1985; De Silva, 1980) . Sri Lanka is a continental island separated from India by shallow water ( < 100 m) and a series of islands. Although its fauna has numerous endemics (Nussbaum & Gans, 1981; Gans & Fetcho, 1982) , many of its species are also found in India (review in Darlington, 1957: 491) . For a group of burrowers such as uropeltines it is perhaps not surprising that endemism is fairly high at the species level. Several faunal elements of Sri Lanka, including caecilians (Nussbaum & Gans, 1981) , some lizards, birds and other snakes, show the pattern exhibited by C. maculatus, with Indomalayan rather than Indian affinities (Darlington, 1957) .",

Although we cannot provide a rigorous time framework for this origin, the molecular differentiation between Rhinophis travancoricus (the sister species of the Sri Lankan radiation) and the Sri Lankan species is reasonably large ( D , = 0.733 k0.17; AID = 20).

It may also reflect the situation that the eastern plains of south India are wide and relatively dry; certainly at present they lack uropeltid populations or rivers that might facilitate cross-oceanic transport by rafting. The pattern of relationships of the Indian species and their molecular differentiation from one another and from the Sri Lankan species is an indication that uropeltines has a long period of differentiation in India before their entry into Sri Lanka. If our hypothesis concerning the monophyly of the Sri Lankan uropeltines is correct, then it suggests that vicariance of a fauna generally distributed in southern India and Sri Lanka was not the mode of differentiation of the extant radiations in that area.",

As measured immunologically, the molecular differentiation between the two species of Cylindrophis (AID = 9) is only about half that between Rhinophis travancoricus (India) and the Sri Lankan uropeltines (AID = 20) (unpublished electrophoretic comparisons of C. maculatus and C. rufus show a similar disparity as compared to the differentiation between Sri Lankan uropeltines and R. travancoricus). Since our rate tests (Table 7) indicate no clear differences in rates of albumin evolution in Cylindrophis and the uropeltines, this suggests that the speciation of the two Cylindrophis occurred much later than the separation of the Sri Lankan clade of uropeltines from its mainland sister clade.",

Accepting the tree in Fig. 2 as the bestsupported hypothesis of uropeltine relationships suggests a general correspondence to their distributions on the islands. Rhinophis oxyrhynchus and R. dorsimaculatus (northern and western plains), and Pseudotyphlops philippinus (northern, western and southern plains up to about 400 m) are lowland species. The remaining species either occupy mid-levels mountains or the very highest ones. Thus, R. philippinus and R. trevelyanus occur at elevations between 400 and 800 m in a central belt of mountains, replacing each other in a zone from the Gammaduwa area south to above Balangoda. Uropeltis phillipsi is endemic to the mountains of the Gammaduwa area, whereas the locally parapatric U. melanogaster ranges from there to south of Kandy, with another mid-elevation population found far to the south. These mid-elevation species form a clade in If these relationships can be corroborated with other character sets, then it suggests that on Sri Lanka at most there have been two radiations of uropeltines into montane biotopes. The relationships here postulated are broadly concordant with present distribution patterns of the species at mid-and high elevations. Further investigation may confirm the hypothesis suggested by the distance Wagner analysis (Fig. 2) , and supported by FREQPARS optimization of this tree, that the lowland species, Rhinophis dorsimaculatus, R. oxyrhynchus and Pseudo-tyPhlopsphilippinus, are early derivatives of the Sri Lankan clade. Since the Indian sister taxon to the Sri Lankan uropeltines (R. travancoricus) is also a lowland species, we hypothesize that the radiation of uropeltines on Sri Lanka was initially by occupation of the lowland biotopes and subsequent adaptation to montane environments.",

A well-developed theoretical and empirical framework relating variation detected by electrophoresis within populations to genetic structure (e.g. Wright, 1978) allows us to make inferences concerning these aspects of their biology. The high levels of polymorphism within populations and heterozygosity within individuals (Table 3) are both often associated with large effective population sizes (Nei, 1975; Nei, 1983) , and indicate that these species maintain relatively large, outbreeding populations. Similarly, the lack of any indication of heterozygote deficiencies and the tendency toward negative F,, values (Table 4 ) are suggestive of populations in which matings between related individuals are uncommon and in which population substructuring (deme formation) does not occur. We infer from these data that despite the apparent fragmentary distribution and small range size of many species of uropeltids (Rajendran, 1985; De Silva, 1980 ; personal observations) some populations can be large and outcrossing. Anecdotal observations are in agreement with this inference, in that at least some species are locally abundant and may be the most common snakes where they are found.",

This hypothesis has been used to explain patterns of allozyme variability in some groups (e.g. McDonald , 1974; Nevo, 1982) , but has received little credence from other studies (Gooch & Schopf, 1973; Mitter & Futuyma, 1979; Schnell & Selander, 1981; Patton, 1984; Futuyma & Peterson, 1985) .

We echo earlier comments (Dessauer el at., 1987) that any observed relationship between levels of genetic diversity and ecological diversity is very tenuous, and suggest that most empirical evidence favours aspects of population genetic structure and history as major determinants of the genetic variation reflected in allozyme polymorphisms.",

Although a lower slope could be explained by inclusion of a higher proportion of rapidly-evolving loci in our electrophoretic study (Sarich, 1977) , thereby inflating estimates of D, this is unlikely to explain our results since only about 10% of the loci we included in our calculations were rapidly-evolving (these generally include secreted proteins, such as albumin and transferrin, as well as some enzymes such as esterases). Another possibility, which we are unable to evaluate with present data, is a bias toward low values in the MC'F distances, as shown for some primate comparisons (Cronin, Sarich & Ryder, 1984) . We are inclined to attribute the lower slope in part to increased resolution of allelic differences in our electrophoretic study (hence yielding greater D values) due to the use of the vertical gel method, long gel-running times (1 7 to 20 hours) and exhaustive testing of running conditions to discriminate maximally among taxa. These are not the standard conditions used in most electrophoretic surveys from which the D values used b y Sarich (1977) and subsequent workers were calculated.",

In two groups of colubrid snakes, natricines and colubrines, electro-phoretic genetic distances average about 0.48 between Old and New World species (Dessauer et al., 1987) , and the corresponding albumin immunological distances generally range from 30-50 (Dowling et al., 1983; Cadle, 1984; Cadle, unpublished data) . For these colubrids, AID/D is on the order of 6O--lOO, or three to five times the value for uropeltids. It should be noted that this latter value is minimally twice the expectation based on the original calibration of these two measures (Sarich, 1977) . Thus, in comparison to other vertebrates, the relationship between protein evolution as measured electrophoretically and by albumin immunology in uropeltids indicates relatively great differentiation at electrophoretic loci, or, conversely, rather conservative albumin evolution. Our present data do not distinguish between these alternatives. Because calculations of genetic distances from electrophoretic data are very dependent on the choice of loci examined (Sarich, 1977) , and on the discriminatory power of the electrophoretic techniques used, we attribute part of our 'high' D values to these factors. However, there is now ample evidence that rates of albumin evolution differ among taxonomic groups and this possibility should not be discounted in the uropeltid case. Early work on birds and more recent investigations of turtles (Rainey, 1983) showed that the rate of change of their albumins is about one-third to one-fifth that of some mammalian albumins (e.g. ungulates and anthropoids). More detailed consideration of rates within mammals clearly shows rate variation among major groups. For example, phyllostomatoid bat albumins have changed at a rate about twice that for ungulate and anthropoid albumins (Cronin & Sarich, 1980;  V. M. Sarich, personal communication) , whereas carnivore albumins in general are slower (Sarich, 1985) . Among snakes, some viperid albumins, especially among pit vipers, appear to change at a rate about 500/, slower than that typical of colubrids (Dessauer et al., 1987) . Thus, we should expect the relationship between albumin immunological distances and Nei's genetic distances to vary among taxonomic groups. These considerations do not obviate the use of these data for dating evolutionary events, but they do argue for caution in the application of 'standard' calibrations for deriving divergence times from either genetic or immunological distances. We urge molecular workers to use rate tests and develop taxon-specific calibrations for these measures.",

With the exception of these OTU clusters we do not consider relationships among group (3) species resolvable by these data. Clearly, most of the differentiation occurs among individual species and not among successive clusters of species (note basal branch lengths as compared to tip lengths in",
