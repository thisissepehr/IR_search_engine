Where the hemorrhage occurs postpartum, uterine atony with or without retained products should be suspected. Oxytocin should be administered, the bladder should be emptied, and the uterus massaged. Intravenous access is obtained, blood is sent for crossmatching, and if crossmatched blood is unavailable, O negative blood is obtained. Th e obstetrician should examine the genital tract for evidence of trauma. If bleeding persists, prostaglandin therapy -either intravenous prostaglandin E 2 or 15-methyl prostaglandin F 2\u03b1 -is administered. Consideration should be given to uterine tamponade, by packing or balloon compression. Continued bleeding should result in surgical intervention: arterial ligation, B-Lynch suture, Cesarean hyste rectomy, or uterine artery embolization [4] . It is important that these interventions occur without delay; with each advancing minute, continued blood loss leads to loss of clotting factors, coagulopathy, and the potential for exsanguination. It is imperative that the patient be kept warm and that blood products and fl uids be warmed through a rapid transfusion device. An arterial line should be placed to measure blood pressure and pulse pressure variability and to take blood samples to track hematocrit and acid-base status.

As pregnancy progresses, placenta ischemia worsens, and the mother becomes hypovolemic and hypertensive and may develop renal dysfunction.

PET is associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality, for the mother and fetus. PET usually resolves following delivery of the fetus but may manifest postpartum. A variety of antihypertensive agents, including hydralazine, labetalol, sodium nitroprusside, alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, and methyl dopa, have been advocated in PET. Hydralazine and labetalol are the most widely used of these in the critical care setting. Hydralazine is administered by slow intravenous injection: fi rst with 5 mg intravenously and repeated at 20-minute intervals (5 to 10 mg depending on the response). Once blood pressure control is achieved, hydrala zine can be repeated as needed (usually about every 3 hours). Labetolol is started at 20 mg intravenously as a bolus, and the dose is doubled every 10 minutes until blood pressure is under control. Th e maximum dose is 220 mg. Magnesium is usually co-administered to provide vaso dila tation and prevent seizures. Care should be taken with fl uid resuscitation because of the risk of pulmonary edema. Eclampsia is an extreme complication of PET and is defi ned by the occurrence of seizures in the absence of other neurologic disorders. Up to 40% of seizures occur following delivery.
