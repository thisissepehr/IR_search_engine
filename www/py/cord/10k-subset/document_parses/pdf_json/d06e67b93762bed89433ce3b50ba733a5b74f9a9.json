To potentially facilitate preparedness plans for future pandemics, we retrospectively quantitated surges in all-cause mechanical ventilator use during peak influenza for 12 consecutive years in all certified hospitals in Maryland. Methods: Influenza testing data obtained for the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, Health and Human Services region 3, included defined peak influenza outbreak periods (PIOP), non-influenza time periods (non-ITP), and proportions of circulating influenza types for all study years. Procedure codes for mechanical ventilator use and diagnostic codes for medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) were reviewed for every Maryland hospitalization. Daily counts of hospitalizations associated with ventilator use or MAARI during PIOP compared to non-ITP were analyzed using Poisson regression adjusted for month and year. Results: Ventilator use increased during PIOP by 7% (95% CI, 5-10) over non-ITP (P ,.0001) for all study years. These annual surges correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by MAARI-related hospitalizations (correlation coefficient 5 0.91, P ,.0001). Conclusions: Surges in ventilator use were temporally associated with PIOP and were positively correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by hospitalizations associated with acute respiratory illness. This information may assist resource planning for future pandemics.

Space includes appropriate medical facilities to provide safe critical care. Staff includes appropriately trained medical professionals to care for critically ill patients. Systems include pre-event planning activities such as forming coalitions; developing and exercising communication protocols; and providing logistics, support, and training before and during an event. Finally, equipment and supplies include access to appropriate durable and disposable critical medical equipment and supplies. 5 Many hospitals have minimal reserves of durable medical equipment such as mechanical ventilators onsite at any one time; additional units are usually rented from medical supply vendors. 5, 6 The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and some states have or are developing stockpiles of mechanical ventilators and associated supplies such as ventilator circuits and drugs such as neuromuscularblocking agents to address surges in critically ill patients during future influenza pandemics. 5, 7 Reliable estimates of such critical care equipment are needed to determine government stockpiling goals for future events. Previous predictions of projected national ventilation needs are based on historical pandemics and limited by the uncertainties in reconstructing these events. 8, 9 Examining increases in the use of mechanical ventilation during multiple seasonal influenza outbreak periods may help to identify the quantitative range of peak surge in the use of mechanical ventilators and associated operational capabilities during seasonal influenza outbreaks.

This finding is important because influenza illnesses likely represent only a fraction of the medical conditions that require the use of mechanical ventilation. 22 The association of influenza infection with surges in ventilator use was suggested by 4 key findings in this study. First, an important finding was a statistically significant increase in ventilator use temporally related to peak influenza activity. Second, a statistically significant correlation was observed between increases in ventilator use and the intensity of the influenza season, as measured by increases in acute respiratory illness-related hospitalizations during peak influenza activity. Third, the surge in ventilator use during the PIOP was predominantly driven by patients who required mechanical ventilation and who also had acute respiratory illness, as defined by MAARI diagnostic codes. Fourth, a statistically significant correlation was observed between the proportions of circulating A/H3N2 viruses and ventilator use in individuals older than 64 years of age, which is the population most likely to need ventilators. This last finding supports previous reports in the literature, which demonstrate that infection with seasonal influenza A/H3N2 causes more severe illness than other influenza virus types or subtypes, especially in the elderly. 11, 12, 17, 19 The data on ventilator use related in this study involved all-cause use. Trauma units, neurological or surgical intensive The overall surge in the use of mechanical ventilators during peak seasonal influenza periods may not appear profound but, in fact, may be very important during pandemic influenza outbreaks, when pandemic strains are likely to induce more severe illness than occur with seasonal strains. It has been speculated that hospitals may not have available on-site all of the mechanical ventilators needed and may have to rent equipment from medical supply companies in times of high demand. 5, 6 To our knowledge, this study is the first to use a large data set to directly quantify the excess all-cause hospitalizations associated with ventilator use during multiple seasonal influenza peak outbreaks.

These possibilities make decisions on stockpiling goals for critical care equipment based on seasonal outbreak information challenging. 9 Finally, it is important to note that stockpiling durable and disposable critical medical equipment and supplies is a necessary but not sufficient capability for pandemic influenza preparedness. Enhancing the other operational capabilities such as space, staff, and systems is an imperative part of pandemic preparedness. Experts in the field have indicated that systems are particularly important to effectively utilize stockpiled medical countermeasures such as mechanical ventilators.

DEFINING THE STUDY INTERVALS OF INTEREST AND CHARACTERIZATION OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES Each study year was defined from July 1 of the first year to June 30 of the following year. Two exceptions were used for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The first pandemic H1N1 wave occurred in late spring and early summer of 2009 and continued into the summer of 2009. 20 For the purpose of this investigation, study year 2008-2009 was defined from July 1, 2008, to July 4, 2009, to include the peak 4 weeks of the first pandemic H1N1 wave. Study year 2009-2010 was from July 5, 2009, through June 30, 2010, and included the second major pandemic H1N1 wave. US Health and Human Services (HHS) region 3 (ie, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia) influenza virus surveillance data for the 2001-2002 through 2012-2013 seasons were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) interactive website. 20 CDC data on weekly counts of all positive influenza tests in HHS region 3 were used to define the discrete time intervals used for the analyses of each study year. The PIOP consisted of 4 consecutive weeks, including the peak week, with the highest number of positive influenza test results per HHS region 3 data.
