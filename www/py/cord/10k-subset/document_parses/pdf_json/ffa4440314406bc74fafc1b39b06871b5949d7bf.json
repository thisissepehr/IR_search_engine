Oligonucleotides and their derivates were conjugated with the TiO 2 nanoparticles, which were obtained as colloidal solutions at a concentration of TiO 2 0.3M by TiCl 4 hydrolysis. The electronic microscopy of various cell cultures (KCT, Vero, and MDCK) treated with nanoparticle solutions (20 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) showed that nanoparticles could enter the cells and accumulate in the vacuoles and phagosomes and form inclusions in cytoplasm. Thus, we demonstrated the penetration of TiO 2 nanoparticles and their oligonucleotide conjugates into intracellular space without any auxiliary operations. Most other researches used electroporation techniques for similar purposes [1, 2, 5].",

One reason for this growth is antibioticotherapy (a widespread method for treating bacterial infections), which is ineffective in treating viral diseases because of the principal difference in the duplication biology of bacteria and virus in the human organism. In addition, many of virus pathogens very changeable, which sig nificantly decreases the efficiency of the vaccinal pre vention of virus infections. Viral genetic material damage, particularly with antisense oligonucleotides, is one of the most promis ing strategies for antiviral therapy. However, delivering olygonucleotides directly into the injured cell is the biggest problem in this case.",

Voloshchak et al. studied intra cellular distribution in the eukaryotic cells of TiO 2 nanoparticles conjugated with specific oligonucle otides [1, 2] . As was determined during the experi ments, these nanoconjugates interacted specifically with DNA localized in the cell nucleus and mitochon drion. The main method for the transformation of the cells was electroporation, which damages cell mem branes. Unfortunately, this technology of delivering nanoparticles conjugated with bioactive substances into the damaged cells is not acceptable in clinical conditions. The authors specified that nanoparticles penetrate into the cells during incubation, but they didn't detail the conditions of the incubation.",

The authors dem onstrated the dependency of the nanoparticles sizes and the penetrating efficiency of the conjugates. The optimal sizes of gold nanoparticles was from 40 to 50 nm.

Thus, we suggested that the optimal size of our nanoparticles may be smaller and the nanoconjugate's internalization occurs without interaction with a spe cific receptor.",
