The fatty acid profile (dependending on the growth medium used for culture) of a microbe is complex and unique to each bacterial strain, and hence, it can be used for identification purposes.

However, in Sweden, the gramnegative Gammaproteobacteria Acinetobacter was dominating. Cultivation-dependent techniques typically display a high proportion of gram-positive bacterial phyla (Atlas and Bartha 1997) , and genera such as Micrococcus, Bacillus and Staphylococcus are commonly found in air samples from different sources (Mancinelli and Shulls 1978; Fang et al. 2007; Dybwad et al. 2012 Dybwad et al. , 2014 Fykse et al. 2008 ). The results obtained in this work emphasize and supports these findings. However, it is challenging to predict how representative the microbial population identified in the present study are based on cultivation, when compared to the real airborne microbial community. It is difficult to find an optimal growth medium for a wide set of viable bacteria in air samples. In this study, TSA agar was chosen based on the requirements for the MIDI MIS analysis. Using different growth media, other bacterial species might have been recovered; however, gram-positive bacteria mainly identified in Norway and Finland are commonly identified in air samples. The results described in this study only represent a set of bacteria found during the three sampling periods in the three countries and are not representing the total bacterial diversity per se at the different sampling sites. Culture methods may also suffer from methodological constrains since bacterial groups can be overestimated, exemplified by Aeromonas and Acinetobacter showing high plating efficiency on nutrient-rich agar (Amann et al. 1995) . Culture-independent methods have become important for analysis of bacterial diversity in the environment since \\1 % of the bacteria in such communities is cultivable by standard laboratory methods (Amann et al. 1995) . Since the year 2000, several cultureindependent studies have been published and these studies show that the dominant-bacterial phyla differ in different locations and bacterial sequences affiliated to the gram-negative Proteobacteria are commonly found (Radosevich et al. 2002; Maron et al. 2005; Despres et al. 2007; Fierer et al. 2008) , which support the findings of Acinetobacter in Sweden during the first sampling period. A recent study where culturedependent and culture-independent methods were compared showed that the majority of the cloned sequences (60 %) from an aerosol sample were closely related to the cultured bacteria identified and sequences related to the Gammaproteobacteria, (25) The isolates were classified to order or higher. The 16S rDNA sequences were taxonomically identified by comparison with reference databases, the RDP database and the BLASTn database in NCBI Genbank. Only isolates identified using all three methods (N = 103) are included in this comparison Aerobiologia (2015) 31:271-281 277 Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and Firmicutes frequently appeared (Fahlgren et al. 2010) . The Acinetobacter bacteria are widely found in nature, mostly in water and soil. However, they have also been isolated from the skin, throat, and various other sites in healthy people. Acinetobacter baumanni is often associated with hospital-acquired infections but does not typically colonize healthy people outside hospital settings (Peleg et al. 2008) . It is difficult to explain the high level of Acinetobacter isolated in Sweden compared to Norway and Finland. However, during the first experiment in Sweden, the temporal increase in the level of total bacteria showed correlation with sudden wind direction changes (results not shown). This implies that materials may have been stirred up from the ground, e.g., soil or dust particles and that the origin possibly is from a rather localized source. The area around the sampling site in Sweden can be described as a suburban area close to coniferous forest. In general, the weather conditions during the sampling periods were also similar and can hardly explain the observed differences. However, it may also be due to cultivation biases that Acinetobacter would have been overestimated (Amann et al. 1995) . The present study has increased the knowledge about the airborne bacterial background in outdoor air. The performance of a biological detector, including sensitivity and false positive/negative rate, is dependent on the sensor's operating environment such as the microbial diversity in air.

In general, all three technologies turned out to be useful methods for identification of bacterial isolates collected from air. The 16S rDNA sequencing method is time-consuming and more laborious compared to MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI analyses. MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI MIS reduce the time required for identification of bacterial isolates since sample preparation and analysis time are shorter (minutes-hours) compared to 16S rDNA sequencing, which includes PCR, sequencing of the PCR amplicons, sequence evaluation and trimming and taxonomic analysis (days). When comparing the ability of the 16S rDNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS to identify and assign the bacterial isolates to a taxonomic level, no significant difference between the two Fig. 4 Comparison of the ability of the three methods, 16S rDNA sequencing, MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI MIS analysis for taxonomic assignment of the airborne bacterial isolates (N = 103) to order or higher. The comparison is based on the number of isolates classified to the taxonomic levels genus, family or order using the three methods. a Comparison of 16S rDNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS for assignment of 97 bacterial isolates to taxonomic level. b Comparison of 16S rDNA sequencing and MIDI MIS analysis for assignment of 107 bacterial isolates to taxonomic level. c Comparison of MIDI and MALDI-TOF for assignment of 91 bacterial isolates to taxonomic level technologies appeared, and 87 % of the isolates were assigned to similar genus. This result is in agreement with the conclusion in the study of Dybwad et al. 2012 . A significant difference between the 16S rDNA sequencing and MIDI analysis was identified, and a higher percentage of the isolates were not assigned to a taxonomic level (compared to 16S rDNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF) when using the MIDI identification system. One explanation for this difference might be differences in the databases used in the various identification methods. In general, the Biotyper 2.0 used for MALDI-TOF MS have been used extensively for analysis of clinical isolates (Eigner et al. 2009; Patel 2013) , and MALDI-TOF MS is well established in clinical laboratories and is used as a high throughput rapid identification method of clinical isolates (Benagli et al. 2011) . The database used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis needs to be expanded by several environmental bacteria, which will greatly benefit the use of this method for identification of environmental isolates (Dybwad et al. 2014 ). The database used for MIDI MIS analysis is for environmental aerobic bacteria. However, an advantage of MALDI-TOF MS compared to MIDI analysis is that the culture media have no effect on the identification. The MIDI analyzes is based on fatty acid methyl ester analysis by gas chromatography, and the database used is based on the use of TSA agar (Slabbinck et al. 2009 ). The present results are in agreement with other studies showing that the MALDI-TOF MS method is comparable to the 16S rDNA sequencing method for identification of bacterial isolates (Seng et al. 2013 ). In the case of identification and classification of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in sea food, the MALDI-TOF MS analysis demonstrated to be a competent bacterial typing tool, and in some cases, MALDI-TOF MS had more discriminating potential than 16S rDNA sequencing (B\u00f6hme et al. 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 144, "text": "(Benagli et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 182, "end": 204, "text": "(Slabbinck et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1764, "text": "Dybwad et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2278, "text": "(Eigner et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2290, "text": "Patel 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2437, "end": 2458, "text": "(Benagli et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2675, "text": "(Dybwad et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3026, "end": 3048, "text": "(Slabbinck et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3234, "end": 3251, "text": "(Seng et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3524, "end": 3543, "text": "(B\u00f6hme et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 942, "end": 948, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, MALDI-TOF MS using the Biotyper 2.0 has proven to be a fast, accurate and reliable technique for taxonomic identification of airborne bacterial isolates.

The MIDI method was also useful; however, the percentages of the isolates identified and classified to genus level were lower, and this method is dependent on the growth media used. In conclusion, this study, where bacterial isolates collected from air was identified, showed that the 16S rDNA sequencing and the MALDI-TOF MS analysis had similar discriminating power, whereas the MIDI method turned out to have less discriminating power in this comparison using the databases specified under the present conditions.

The samples for MIDI analysis were prepared precisely according to manufacturer's instruction (http:// www.midi-inc.com/index.html). Shortly, collected bacterial colonies were treated with saponin and sodium hydroxide/methanol mixture and methylation of free cellular fatty acid with a methanol/hydrochloride acid mixture. Then, methyl esters of the fatty acid were extracted with organic solvent and analyzed by gas chromatography. The fatty acid profile of an unknown sample is compared to the profiles in the library of reference strains. Different libraries are available for different growth conditions. An Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA 95051 United States) 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an Agilent 7683 autosampler, split-splitless inlet and flame ionization detector were used. The GC system was controlled with MIS Sherlock \u00d2 (MIDI, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) and Agilent Chem Station software.
