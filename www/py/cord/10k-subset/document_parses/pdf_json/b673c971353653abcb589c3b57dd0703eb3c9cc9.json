Yet, many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking. Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity.

Nevertheless, antibody serologic tests frequently exhibit suboptimal performance characteristics as measured by clinical sensitivity and specificity, require subjective interpretation 1 , and/or depend upon multi-step algorithms 2,3 . Serologic assays using whole cell material and antigen mixtures can have high false positive rates, leading to unnecessary follow-up tests, inappropriate treatments, or misdiagnosis of patients. Antibody serologic methods typically provide a narrow view of immunity towards a single, or small number of antigens or organisms, while an estimated 1400 pathogens may cause human disease 4 . And, many of these diseases lack effective serology tests altogether.

To expand the breadth and information content of parallel immunoassays, pathogen-proteome derived phage display libraries and planar peptide arrays have been developed. For example, a phage display library of 93,904, 56-mer peptides spanning 208 human virus proteomes was constructed 11, 12 . Following immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing, seropositivity towards each virus was inferred. However, comprehensive proteome tiling for many higher complexity organisms is currently impractical given their larger proteome size. Similarly, the tiling of overlapping peptides from sets of a priori known antigens from eight tick-borne pathogens enabled construction of a planar peptide arrays with 170,000 features enabling detection of each infection 2 . In principle, this method could be expanded to include a larger number of pathogens but requires known antigens or epitopes, and does not provide sufficient peptide diversity to mimic diverse structural epitopes.

To effectively mimic the diverse linear, structural, and post-translationally modified epitopes from many different organisms, a random peptide library consisting of 10 10 random 12-mers 15 displayed on the outer surface of E. coli bacteria was used. As a source of diversity, we selected 12-mer random peptides since prior studies of antibody binding epitopes have reported that 95% of linear epitopes span fewer than 12 amino acids 18 . On the other hand, simple structural epitopes (e.g. alpha-helices, beta-hair-pin motifs) can benefit from longer candidate peptides. However, as peptide length grows library quality can deteriorate due to oligonucleotide synthesis errors, or expression and display bias introduced by the peptide display vector. Furthermore, longer peptide sequences (e.g. >15) can contain a larger number of distinct epitopes, thereby increasing opportunities for peptide cross-reactivity with antibodies with divergent specificity.
