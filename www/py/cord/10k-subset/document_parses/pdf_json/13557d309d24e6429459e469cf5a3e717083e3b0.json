During 2013-2017, total infection rate and total incidence density per 1000 patient days of HAIs were similar to those found during 2006-2010 (9.9% and 3.2 vs. 9% and 3.5). In partial accordance with our data, a single center cohort study in an Italian NICU reported an infection rate of 13.2% and an incidence density of 7.8 HAIs per 1000 patient days [16] and a multicenter prospective cohort study in six Italian NICUs reported an infection rate of 12.8% and an incidence density of 6.93 HAIs per 1000 patient-days [17] . Also, a multicenter retrospective cohort study in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and NICUs in Italy and Brazil during 2010-2014 described a cumulative incidence of HAI of 3.6/100 ICU admissions and an infection rate of 3.6/1000 ICU days [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 698, "end": 702, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 950, "end": 954, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Similarly to HAIs occurred during 2006-2010 study period in the same NICU [18] , HAIs were more frequent in low birth weight groups (< 1000 g 60.8%; in detail BW1 < 750 g 37.6% and BW2 750-1000 g 23.20%) but developed in all BW classes.

This finding is in agreement with previous studies showing that bloodstream infections prevailed among HAIs in Italian NICUs [16, 17] and that bloodstream infections were the main infections (45,4%), followed by lower respiratory tract infections (27.8%) and urinary tract infections (15.8%) in Italian and Brazilian PICUs and NICUs [19] .

This might have been dependent on the increase in VAPs in very-low birth weight neonates caused by two outbreaks during 2006-2010 period in the NICU [21, 24] . The elevated number of device-associated infections in the NICU strengthen the importance to calculate device utilization rates and use as risk factors for the development of CLABSIs and VAPs according to NHSN surveillance protocol [3] [4] [5] . Also, in agreement with previous surveillance studies of HAIs in other NICUs [16, 19, 29] and in the same NICU during 2006-2010 [18] , UTIs were the third most frequent cause of HAIs after CLABSIs and VAPs in our NICU, but decreased from 28.8% [18] The differences in the aetiologies of VAPs and CLABSIs between the two periods could have been due to the occurrence of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii outbreaks in the NICU during the first study period [21, 24] . Moreover, an increase in bloodstream infections caused by C. parapsilosis was observed during 2009-2012 in the NICU [22] , which might have been responsible for the high incidence of CLABSIs caused by Candida spp. The increase of CLABSIs by undetermined aetiology during 2013-2017 it is worrying and without a definite cause.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 330, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 331, "end": 334, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 669, "end": 672, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 827, "end": 831, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1039, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1043, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1166, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 173, "text": "(Fig. 3b", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We recognize that our study has limitations that affect the generalization of our results.

Both the crude mortality rate and the mortality rate of infected patients increased during 2013-2017 compared with the 2006-2010 study period. This could have been contributed by the higher number of patient days, central line utilization and ventilation utilization in the \u2264750 g BW class and the higher number of CLABSI during 2013-2017 compared with 2006-2010 study period. Additional epidemiological information was provided by the analysis of the incidence densities of etiology of CLABSIs and VAPs in our NICU during 2013-2017 and the comparison with those found during 2006-2010. During 2013-2017, Gram-positive bacteria, in particular CONS (25.3%) and S. aureus (2.3%), were the most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSIs. This finding is in accordance with several reports showing that grampositive bacteria are the main cause of bloodstream infections in neonates in the NICUs [4, 12, 17, 28-30]. Other most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSIs in the NICU were Candida spp., C. parapsilosis (21.8%) and C. albicans (4.6%), P. aeruginosa (5.7%), E. coli (3.4%) and K. pneumoniae (3.4%). During 2013-2017, VAPs were most frequently caused by P. aeruginosa (28%), S. maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%). UTIs represented the most frequent device-unrelated infection in the NICU during 2013-2017 and were most frequently caused by E. coli (18.18%), K. pneumoniae (18.18%) and Enterobacter spp. (18.18%). The comparison of the etiologies of CLABSIs in the NICU between the two study periods showed a significant higher incidence density of CLABSIs caused by Gram-positive bacteria (p = 0.002) and by undetermined aetiology (p = 0.01) and a significant lower incidence of CLABSIs caused by Candida spp. (p = 0.05) during 2013-2017 compared to 2006-2010 period.
