In host cells, some transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT, along with plasmin in the bloodstream, have been reported to cleave the HA precursor (HA 0 ) molecule into its active forms, HA 1 and HA 2 . Some trypsinogens can also enhance IAV proliferation in some cell types (e.g., rat cardiomyoblasts). However, the precise activation mechanism for this process is unclear, because the expression level of the physiological activator of the trypsinogens, the TMPRSS15 enterokinase, is expected to be very low in such cells, with the exception of duodenal cells. Here, we show that at least two variant enterokinases are expressed in various human cell lines, including A549 lung-derived cells. The exogenous expression of these enterokinases was able to enhance the proliferation of IAV in 293T human kidney cells, but the proliferation was reduced by knocking down the endogenous enterokinase in A549 cells. The enterokinase was able to enhance HA processing in the cells, which activated trypsinogen in vitro and in the IAV-infected cells also. Therefore, we conclude that enterokinase plays a role in IAV infection and proliferation by activating trypsinogen to process viral HA in human cell lines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza viral infections are an impending threat to humans because recent globalization has increased the likelihood of pandemics happening with these highly infectious pathogens (Richard and Fouchier, 2016; Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016) . The life cycle of influenza A virus (IAV) begins when it adsorbs to a host cell, it enters it, becomes uncoated, proliferates, assembles into viral particles, and is finally released when it buds away from the cell. The cycle is sophisticatedly regulated by many viral and cellular factors (Medina and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2011) . Environmental factors, including the host immune system, also affect viral proliferation and infectivity (Duan and Thomas, 2016) . One such critical factor is a group of trypsin-like proteases. These proteases activate viral hemagglutinin (HA), which is required for viral adsorption to sialic acids on the target-cell surface and in the uncoating process that releases viral genomic RNA into the host cell (Fontana and Steven, 2015; Blijleven et al., 2016) . Trypsin-like proteases are located across various sites in the host's body. The transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSSs), which include TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and HAT, are present within cells or on cell surfaces. In contrast, some trypsin-type proteases are secreted in the tissues, and plasminogen occurs in the blood. These proteases activate the precursor HA (designated HA 0 ) by cleavage at specific sites to generate the mature HA 1 and HA 2 conformations (Goto and Kawaoka, 1998; Choi et al., 2009; Kido, 2015) . Various trypsin genes (PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3) are expressed in non-pancreatic cells in humans (Wang et al., 2008; Yamamoto-Tanaka et al., 2014; Ghilardi et al., 2015) , and some ectopic trypsins can enhance IAV proliferation in rat cardiomyoblasts and the lungs (Pan et al., 2011; Indalao et al., 2017) . However, the activation mechanism used by PRSS trypsinogens is unclear, because expression of the physiological activator enterokinase (EK, or TMPRSS15) is reported to be restricted to duodenal epithelial cells. Because the presence of an EK on duodenal cells activates the trypsinogens that are secreted into the alimentary tract from the pancreas to digest food (Kitamoto et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 2009) , we hypothesized that a small but substantial amount of EK is likely expressed in many non-duodenal cells, where it activates trypsinogens to cleave HA 0 on the influenza viruses, thereby facilitating their infection and proliferation process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 209, "text": "(Richard and Fouchier, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 210, "end": 246, "text": "Saunders-Hastings and Krewski, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 539, "end": 571, "text": "(Medina and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 679, "end": 702, "text": "(Duan and Thomas, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 981, "end": 1007, "text": "(Fontana and Steven, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1031, "text": "Blijleven et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1516, "text": "(Goto and Kawaoka, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1535, "text": "Choi et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1547, "text": "Kido, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1665, "text": "(Wang et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1666, "end": 1695, "text": "Yamamoto-Tanaka et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1718, "text": "Ghilardi et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1832, "text": "(Pan et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1854, "text": "Indalao et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2244, "text": "(Kitamoto et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2264, "text": "Zheng et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Here, we cloned the cDNAs encoding two EK isoforms (canonical EK and the EK-X2 isoform) from the mRNAs present in human cells, A549 (a lung cell line) and Huh7 (a liver cell line), respectively.

A lysate of 293T cells exogenously expressing a large amount of PRSS3 (Figure 6A ) was used as the source of trypsinogen. Although 293T cells endogenously express certain levels of PRSS1 and PRSS3, the lysate exogenously expressing PRSS3 alone (PRSS3 trypsinogen lysate) showed no catalytic activity for a pNA-attached trypsin substrate. Consequently, the authenticity of the substrate was confirmed by the observation that free pNA was markedly released when the PRSS3 lysate was incubated with a purified EK (GenScript, #Z01003). Each 293T cell lysate exogenously expressing EK, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, HAT proteases, or vector alone, was mixed with the PRSS3 lysate FIGURE 6 | Activation of trypsinogen PRSS3 by TMPRSSs. The activation of trypsinogen PRSS3 by TMPRSSs was measured in vitro by incubating PRSS3-expressing cell lysates with a specific substrate and cell lysates expressing the indicated TMPRSSs. (A) 293T cells transfected with a PRSS3-expressing plasmid or vector alone were lysed at 48 h post-transfection, electrophoresed, and then western blotted with an anti-PRSS3 antibody.

(B) The PRSS3-expressing 293T cell lysate was mixed with 293T cell lysate transiently expressing one of the indicated TMPRSS proteases (EK, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, HAT, or vector only) for the indicated periods. The amount of pNA released from the specific substrate in the mixture was measured at 405 nm as the trypsinogen-activating function (trypsin activity). (C) Lysates prepared from 293T cells stably expressing EK (clone #5-1), EK-X2 (clone #7-6), or vector alone (293T-cont.), shown in Figure 5 , were incubated with PRSS3-epressing 293T cell lysate, and the trypsinogen-activating function was measured. (D,E) 293T cell lysates expressing EK (D) or EK-X2 (E) were mixed with 293T cell lysates transiently expressing one of the indicated trypsinogens (PRSS1, PRSS2, PRSS3, or vector only) for the indicated periods.

The EK lysate was able to activate PRSS3 in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and HAT were all unable to activate PRSS3, which indicates that only EK can cleave and activate the PRSS3 trypsinogen. A trypsinogen-activating function was also detected in the 293T cell lysates stably expressing EK or EK-X2 ( Figure 6C) .

In addition to the HA-processing pathway via the other TMPRSSs reported to date, we propose a novel pathway that enhances IAV infection via EK, which activates trypsinogen to process the HA 0 precursor into mature HA 1 and HA 2 fragments, as shown schematically in Figure 12 . Cell lysates were prepared after the indicated periods and subjected to electrophoresis and western blotting with an anti-IAV HA antibody.

Figure 2 , lung-derived A549 cells predominantly express EK among the TMPRSSs. This is one explanation for why knocking down endogenous EK in A549 cells resulted in reduced IAV proliferation (Figure 11 ). In contrast, the EK knockdown in 293T cells had almost no effect on IAV proliferation (data not shown). This is understandable because 293T cells express both TMPRSS2 and EK, and TMPRSS2 can activate HA even in the absence of EK. Among the TMPRSSs, TMPRSS2 (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006; Chaipan et al., 2009; Bertram et al., 2010; Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014; K\u00fchn et al., 2016) , TMPRSS4 (Chaipan et al., 2009; Bertram et al., 2010; K\u00fchn et al., 2016) , HAT (TMPRSS11D) (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2006) , matriptase (ST14) (Hamilton et al., 2012) , DESC1 (TMPRSS11E) (Zmora et al., 2014) , and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) (Okumura et al., 2010; Zmora et al., 2014) have all been reported to cleave and activate IAV HA. Additionally, TMPRSS2 has been shown to be a major target of many IAV strains including H1N1 in vivo by using knockout mice (Kim et al., 2006; Hatesuer et al., 2013; Sakai et al., 2014) , whereas, TMPRSS4 was a target of another IAV strain (H3N1) in vivo (K\u00fchn et al., 2016) . As for the WSN strain, it uses plasmin to cleave HA 0 with the help of neuraminidase (NA) (Goto and Kawaoka, 1998) . These findings show that host proteases play an important role in determining the cell or tissue tropism of an IAV strain. However, the host protease that is used by IAV depends not only on the expression profiles of the relevant proteases in the targeted cell, but other factors that also regulate protease functions, such as EK-related activation of PRSS3. IAV itself affects the selection process by inducing various cytokines such as interferons, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), or by inhibiting various cellular responses in order to replicate in the cell. For example, IAVinduced IL-1\u03b2 stimulates the expression of PRSSs, including PRSS3, in several cell types (Indalao et al., 2017) , and elevated PRSS3 protein is activated by EKs to induce HA processing. Therefore, EKs may play a role in IAV pathogenicity and cell tropism via PRSS3. ) for 48 h, and the proliferation of IAV was analyzed with western blotting using an anti-HA antibody.

The characteristic structure of EK, whose catalytic domains are exposed on the cell surface, facilitates the development of inhibitors that have minimal adverse effects.

As its name implies, the canonical SEA domain was first detected in sea urchin sperm protein, and in EK and agrin proteins also, but its function is not well understood, except that it is known to be involved in the autoproteolysis that causes subsequent functional domains to be shed or the protein to be degraded, and it also has an effect on the carbohydrate chains nearby it (List et al., 2006) .
