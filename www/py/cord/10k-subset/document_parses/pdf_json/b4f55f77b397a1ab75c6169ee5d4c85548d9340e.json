She also showed other organ failures, including worsening hepatic dysfunction after admission with maximum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 16,520 U/L as well as kidney dysfunction with associated anuria. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for anuria and metabolic acidosis. At 36 hours post-admission, her lactic acid level reached its peak, and her hemodynamic reached a level at which she could tolerate water removal. At 72 hours post-admission, she was administered with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor due to the appearance of myelosuppression.

Unlike what is known from a previous report, this patient reached a critical stage in her presentation, which was not related to drug interaction. Colchicine is a therapeutic drug used in the treatment of intestinal Beh\u00e7et's disease. Fatal cases, in patients whose disease progressed to a critical stage, despite colchicine intake below the lethal dose have been reported. Patients sometimes overdose on colchicine when it is prescribed for pain relief; this indicates the need for caution when prescribing this drug. Although the lethal colchicine dose is considered to be 0.8 mg/kg, the patient in the present case reached a critical stage after an intake of only 0.2 mg/kg. Two main conclusions can be derived from this case. First, patients can follow a critical disease course that can be fatal, even after ingestion of a colchicine dose that is below the lethal level.

Finally, temporary hair loss was seen after the seventh day of ingestion (during the recovery phase) [1, 7] . We believe that the progress of the present case is consistent with colchicine poisoning.
