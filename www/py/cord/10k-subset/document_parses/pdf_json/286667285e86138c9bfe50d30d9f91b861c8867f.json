However, the phenotypic impact of genetic variants often remained unclear, thus the rationale of their use in risk prediction may be limited. We therefore analyzed genetic variants together with anthropometric and lifestyle factors to see how these affect mRNA levels of ERCC1, MDM2 and TP53 in primary blood lymphocytes. mRNA expression was measured in 376 prostate cancer patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription, and ERCC1 rs11615 T>C, ERCC1 rs3212986 C>A, MDM2 rs2279744 T>G and TP53 rs17878362 (p53PIN3) polymorphisms were determined. Considerable interindividual differences in mRNA expression were found (coefficients of variation: ERCC1, 45%; MDM2, 43% and TP53, 35%). ERCC1 expression was positively correlated with plasma levels of b-carotene (P 5 0.03) and negatively correlated with canthaxanthin (P 5 0.02) and lutein (P 5 0.02). Overall, the polymorphisms affected mRNA expression only weakly. Carriers of a distinct ERCC1 haplotype (CC) showed, however, significantly lower expression values than noncarriers (P 5 0.001). Applying logistic regression, we found that CC haplotype carriers had a 1.69-fold increased odds ratio (95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.71) for reduced ERCC1 mRNA levels. This low ERCC1 expression might be associated with reduced DNA repair and better therapy response. In summary, the association we have found between ERCC1 genotype and mRNA expression supports recent clinical observations that genetic variation in ERCC1 can affect treatment outcome and prognosis. Our study further revealed a modulating effect by nutritional factors.",

Ideal markers should be readily detectable in surrogate tissues such as peripheral blood lymphocytes with high precision and appropriate technical effort (2) . As functional characterization of cellular protein markers is often complex and difficult, many studies are currently concentrating on DNA genotype and RNA expression analyses (3, 4) . Measuring steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in circulating lymphocytes should be a good choice as this determines not only efficient gene transcription but also correct processing and maintenance of mRNA. Regulation of mRNA expression is, however, tissue specific and can be affected by genetic and endogenous factors such as age (5) , gender (6) and potentially body mass index (BMI). Exogenous factors like exposure to tobacco smoke (7) or nutrition-dependent serum antioxidant levels (8) have also been shown to influence mRNA expression. To obtain reliable results, these modifying factors have to be taken into consideration together with high technical standards in isolation and processing of RNA throughout the experimental protocol (9) .",

It is, however, difficult to assess the impact of a single-nucleotide polymorphism on a highly complex cellular process such as mRNA expression when using molecular biology methods in cell lines that carry a certain genotype.

In our study with primary lymphocytes of 376 individuals, the observed effects of these polymorphisms, when analyzed separately, were too weak to reach statistical significance. Trends similar to published effects were, however, observed for some polymorphisms. Bond et al. (17) observed elevated MDM2 mRNA expression in cell lines of homozygous GG carriers at MDM2 rs2279744 T.G. We also found a higher median MDM2 mRNA level in homozygous GG individuals as compared with T-allele carriers. A decreased mRNA expression was described in cells carrying TP53 rs17878362 (p53PIN3) (A2/A2) compared with (A1/A1) carrying cells (19) . We observed similar differences in mRNA expression with primary lymphocytes carrying these genotypes. No effect of the rs3212986 C.A genotype on ERCC1 mRNA expression was reported in a small study investigating 67 Korean head and neck cancer patients (31) . This observation was confirmed by our results. TT carriers of the ERCC1 rs11615 T.C polymorphism showed higher ERCC1 mRNA expression levels in our study, but this is in contrast to results observed in two cell lines carrying this genetic variant (15) . Elevated ERCC1 expression in T-allele carriers was also observed in colorectal tumor tissue (32) .",

Reconstruction of ERCC1 haplotypes and subsequent statistical evaluation revealed a distinctly lower mRNA level for CC carriers than for non-carriers (P 5 0.001). As already one CC allele reduced mRNA expression, it could be argued that the CC haplotype exerts a dominant-negative effect on the regulation of ERCC1 mRNA expression. This would imply that the genetically polymorphic nature of ERCC1 can modulate mRNA levels in prostate cancer patients and thus affect therapy outcome. Indeed, different mRNA levels were observed in two study populations when ERCC1 expression was used as a predictive marker for therapy outcome (13, 33, 34) .",

All experimental steps were optimized by controlling carefully for RNA and cDNA integrity, by applying TBP as a reference gene and by normalizing all measurements with a calibrator to adjust for experimental differences during PCRs. These measures increase the probability that the observed interindividual differences in mRNA expression are true differences not affected by high experimental variability. It cannot, however, be excluded that a minor part of these differences is introduced by the normalization step using TBP as a reference. TBP was selected (i) as it is widely accepted as a reliable reference gene (39) (40) (41) and (ii) because it showed an expression level which is comparable with that of the target genes. Validity of our expression data is also supported by the comparability with expression values published in similar studies where TP53 mRNA expression was determined in lymphocytes of bladder cancer patients (5) . The observed interindividual variation for ERCC1 expression was slightly higher in our prostate cancer patients than it was reported in lung or head and neck cancer patients who were analyzed using conventional multiplex RT-PCR (7, 42) .

An intervention study with fruit, vegetables and antioxidants showed no effect of these components on ERCC1 expression in healthy subjects (45) . Astley et al.

Our results show a discernible effect of antioxidants on ERCC1 mRNA expression in prostate cancer patients. These patients might be inflicted with stronger oxidative stress due to their disease (47) (48) (49) , making the effects of antioxidants more pronounced in patients compared with healthy subjects (50) .

ERCC1 expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes was recently found to reflect expression of this gene in head and neck cancer tissue, and it was suggested to be indicative for therapy success (31) . The ratio of ERCC1 mRNA expression in tumor head and neck versus normal tissue was reported to predict the response to neoadjuvant therapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and radiation (34) .",

            "text": "In summary, our results demonstrate considerable interindividual differences in ERCC1 mRNA expression among 376 prostate cancer patients. These differences can be at least partially attributed to genetic variation but can also be modified by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as antioxidants. Only weak effects of single polymorphisms on ERCC1 expression were detected but carriers of ERCC1 CC haplotype had significantly lower expression values than noncarriers. This low ERCC1 expression might be associated with reduced DNA repair and better chemotherapy or radiotherapy response. Our study used primary lymphocytes as suitable surrogate cells to assess the impact of molecular markers in clinical/epidemiological settings, this is because target tissue samples are more difficult to obtain and only available by using invasive procedures (2) . Published studies that aimed to characterize the functional impact of polymorphisms were mainly performed in immortalized tumor cell lines. However, these cells might have cellular characteristics considerably different from those of primary lymphocytes thus explaining some of the observed inconsistencies. Therefore, our ex vivo results in patients contribute to a better understanding of the impact of genetic variants on mRNA expression of DNA repair genes. Once validated in further analyses, such markers should provide valuable tools for the assessment of therapy response. ",

Probes were designed and prepared by Tib Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Analysis was performed in 10 ll volumes in glass capillaries (Roche Diagnostics) using Qiagen reagents: 1\u00c2 PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 2.5% glycerol, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, 0.5 lM of each primer, 0.09 lM of each probe for ERCC1 rs3212986 C.A, 0.045 lM of each probe for ERCC1 rs11615 T.C and 10 ng of DNA. Reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 59\u00b0C (ERCC1 rs3212986) and 57\u00b0C (ERCC1 rs11615) for 10 s and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 12 s. Melting curve analysis was performed with an initial denaturing step at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 45\u00b0C for 20 s, slow heating to 80\u00b0C with a ramping rate of 0.2\u00b0C/s and continuous fluorescence detection.
