In particular, individuals can obtain different types of information about the disease and respond by altering their behaviors, and this can affect the spreading dynamics, possibly in a significant way. We propose a model where individuals' behavioral response is based on a generic type of local information, i.e., the number of neighbors that has been infected with the disease. Mathematically, the response can be characterized by a reduction in the transmission rate by a factor that depends on the number of infected neighbors. Utilizing the standard susceptibleinfected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovery dynamical models for epidemic spreading, we derive a theoretical formula for the epidemic threshold and provide numerical verification. Our analysis lays on a solid quantitative footing the intuition that individual behavioral response can in general suppress epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we find that the hub nodes play the role of \"double-edged sword\" in that they can either suppress or promote outbreak, depending on their responses to the epidemic, providing additional support for the idea that these nodes are key to controlling epidemic spreading in complex networks.

To study the interplay between behavioral response and epidemic spreading has attracted recent attention. In spite of the efforts, a quantitative picture taking into consideration physical reality of the epidemic dynamical process is needed. Here, we propose a model in which individuals' behavioral responses are based on a generic type of local information, i.e., the number of neighbors that have been infected with the disease. This should be contrasted with existing works in which the responses are based on the density of infection among the local neighborhood or on global information. Utilizing the standard SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) and SIR (susceptible-infectedrefractory) dynamical processes for modeling epidemic spreading, we derive theoretical formulas for the epidemic thresholds and provide numerical verification. Our main finding is that individual behavioral response can in general augment significantly the epidemic threshold, thereby suppressing the prevalence of epidemic effectively, regardless of type of the dynamics. Especially, the hub nodes in the network can adaptively and actively generate cautious responses to protect themselves and hence many other nodes in the network. The hub nodes thus play the role of \"double-edged sword\" in epidemic dynamics as they can either suppress or promote outbreak. Our work reinforces the idea that hub nodes are key to controlling epidemic dynamics.",

When individuals become aware of the potential disease, they would take preventive measures (e.g., using better hygiene, wearing protective masks, or avoiding congested public places) to protect themselves and those around them. In this sense, individuals in the network cannot be treated as \"passive\" nodes awaiting to be infected but they can in fact be quite \"reactive\" to the spreading dynamics. Such human behavioral responses can have significant effects on the epidemic dynamics, 1-5 a topic of great recent interest.

Broadly, there are two types of information: local or global. 15 For example, news obtained from the social neighborhood of an individual is local, but information from the mass media or from the public health authorities can be regarded as global. The influences of local [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] or global [21] [22] [23] information based behavioral responses, or awareness, on the epidemic dynamics can in general be quite different, and there is also recent work on a)",

[24] [25] [26] [27] Quantitatively, the impact of different types of information-based awareness can be characterized by how they modify the epidemic threshold and the final epidemic size (or epidemic prevalence). For example, Bagnoli et al. 26 assumed that individuals' risk perception of epidemic is an exponential function of local and global information, and they showed that a nonlinear increase in the perception risk can lead to extinction of the disease. Funk et al. 17 studied the impacts of awareness spread on both epidemic threshold and prevalence and found that, in a well-mixed population, spread of awareness can reduce the outbreak size but does not tend to affect the epidemic threshold. This result, however, does not appear to hold for social networks for which the mixed-population assumption is not valid. In particular, Wu et al. 24 compared the roles of the three forms of information-based awareness, i.e., local, global, and contact awareness, in the epidemic threshold, and concluded that global awareness cannot alter the epidemic threshold, while both local and contact awareness can. Sahneh et al. 6, 7 proved that local information-based response can enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce the prevalence, given that the probability of susceptible individuals to alter their state is proportional to the number of the infected neighbors.",

First, a general result from previous works is that the local information-based responses can enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce its prevalence, but global informationbased awareness, although being capable of altering the epidemic size, has little effect on the threshold. 6, 24, 25 In these works on the interplay between epidemic spreading in complex networks and human behavioral responses, a tacit hypothesis [24] [25] [26] 28 is that local information-based behavioral response is a function of the density of infection among the local neighborhood, denoted as s/k, where s is the number of infected neighbors among a total of k neighbors. However, simple situations can be conceived where this assumption does not hold. For example, consider two nodes in a complex network, i and j, which have 10 and 100 neighbors, respectively. Assume that in their respective neighborhoods, there are 5 and 50 infected nodes. The hypothesis would then assign the two nodes with the same value of s/k, or identical risk perception. However, common sense stipulates that node j, because of the much larger number of infected neighbors, should have stronger awareness about the epidemic than node i. A real-world example is some popular websites or important network routers that have a large probability of being attacked by virus. As a result, for various reasons they tend to be much better protected.",

A key difference between SIS and SIR dynamics is that the former is reversible while the latter is irreversible. 29, 30 Another difference is that, for SIS dynamics, the system can only reach a dynamically steady state since the propagation process always occurs once the transmission rate exceeds the epidemic threshold. However, for the SIR process, propagation will terminate once there are no longer infected nodes in the network. These differences can lead to different interplay between the epidemic dynamics and behavioral response, demanding a systematic comparison study.",

In particular, we assume that individuals generate behavioral responses by reducing their contact rates, depending on the actual number of infected neighbors (not the density of such neighbors), and study how the epidemic thresholds and prevalence for both types of epidemic dynamics are altered. We find that the mechanism generates similar effects on the SIS and SIR epidemic thresholds but lead to different epidemic sizes for the two types of dynamics. An important consequence of our realistic behavioral response mechanism is that, for both SIS and SIR dynamics, the infection densities can be maximized for some intermediate values of the node degree. This implies that both small-and large-degree nodes are relatively more resilient to infection, in sharp contrast to the monotonic increase of the infection density with the node degree as in situations where no behavioral response is taken into account. 31, 32 In Sec. II, we describe our model of epidemic spreading with local information based behavioral response. In Sec. III, we develop theoretical analyses with numerical support to understand the effects of such response on the spreading dynamics in terms of the two fundamental quantities: epidemic threshold and prevalence. Due to the intrinsic difference between SIS and SIR processes, we shall treat them using different theoretical methods. In Sec. IV, we present conclusion and discussions.",

In a network, a node represents an individual and an edge between a pair of nodes specifies a contact through which the epidemic can diffuse or propagate. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] In the absence of any behavioral response, for an unweighted network the contact rate of every pair of nodes can be conveniently set to be unity. A reasonable assumption is that an individual would become more cautious and therefore take more effective preventive measure if many of the neighbors have been infected. The behavioral response can then be modeled quantitatively by introducing the reduction factor (1 -a) s in the contact rate of a susceptible node, where s is the number of infected neighbors and 0 a < 1 is a parameter characterizing the response strength of the individuals to the epidemic. The larger the value of a, the more cautious the individual becomes, resulting a more substantial reduction in the contact rate. In a real situation, the value of a would vary across all the individuals in the network. Here, for simplicity and for gaining insights into the epidemic dynamics subject to behavioral response, we assume identical value of a for all nodes in the network. For the trivial case of a \u00bc 1.0, the contact rate will immediately become zero once a neighbor is infected, ruling out any epidemic outbreak.

For example, a hub node would possibly have many infected neighbors, making it better informed about the epidemic and consequently generating a stronger protective response. Figure 3 shows how q k depends on the degree for different values of a. For a \u00bc 0 (the standard SIS model without any behavioral response), q k increases with degree k. However, for a > 0, e.g., a \u00bc 0.2 and a \u00bc 0.5, we obtain a nonmonotonic dependence: q k first increases with k, reaches a maximal value, and then begins to decrease with k and approach zero for very large values of k. This case can be quantitatively explained using Eq. (7) where, for a fix value of H, the value of (1 -aH) k converges to zero in the numerator. As a result, we have q k \u00bc 0 for sufficiently large values of k. The increasing phase can be understood by noting that nodes with small degree have lower probabilities to reduce their contact rate because they are typically unaware of the disease as their neighbors are few and the infected neighbors are even fewer. As k is increased from some low value, the probability of infection is increased (as for the standard SIS dynamics without behavioral response). Fig. 1 , simulation shows the dependence of the epidemic prevalence q on a. We thus see that, in our model, the hub nodes are capable of inhibiting epidemic spreading, providing an effective way to control the dynamics. This should be contrasted to the traditional models that do not take into account individuals' behavioral responses in which the role of the hub nodes is generally understood as enhancing epidemic spreading.",

Fig. 4(a) indicates that the epidemic prevalence R 1 decreases with a but the critical thresholdk SIR c increases with a. Figure 4 (b) presents the theoretical prediction from Eq. (20) (white line) in comparison with the simulation result for near-zero R 1 value. We observe a good agreement. Figure 5 shows the dependence of R 1 on k for different values of a. Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 5 , we can see that, for SIR dynamics with local behavioral response, the epidemic prevalence also rapidly decreases with a, demonstrating that such a response can be effective to suppress epidemic spreading, as for the case of SIS dynamics. Since, for an SIS process, the system can sustain a dynamically steady state in which the infected individuals are more likely to have their contact rates reduced after becoming susceptible again, 48 one might intuitively expect the effect of behavioral response to be somewhat different. In particular, the intrinsically irreversible SIR dynamics can cause the system to quickly converge to a steady state. As a result, the hub nodes are infected relatively soon and they have no chance to make any behavioral responses, limiting their role in suppressing the spreading. However, we note that the susceptible nodes can adjust their transmission rates based not only on the number of infected nodes but also on the number of recovered nodes, so as to greatly enhance the awareness of hub nodes and effectively reducing the probability of their being infected. Support for this heuristic reasoning can be found in Fig. 6 , where the final recovery density R 1 k as a function of degree k for the SIR model is shown. We see that, even though the hub nodes cannot be completely protected from the epidemic, R 1 k reduces to a low level and decreases as a is increased. Consequently, local behavioral response associated with SIR dynamics can also be effective in suppressing epidemic spreading. (20) . The gray region under the pink dash link indicates the epidemic prevalence R 1 < 7 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . Since the number of the initial infected seeds is I 0 \u00bc 5, we have R 1 ! 5=N \u00bc 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for the steady state. Other parameters are the same as for Fig. 1.   FIG. 5.

We found that such response can in general augment significantly the epidemic threshold, regardless of SIS or SIR dynamics, and we obtained an explicit expression for the augmentation factor.
