The cystecerci can remain in place for many years. For the cycle to continue, undercooked or raw beef must be eaten by humans because cooking kills the cystecerci. After 10 to 12 weeks the worm is fully developed and typically measures about 5 m in length. The worm is folded back on itself and inhabits the small intestine.

A part of the vaccine is derived from third-stage larvae to reduce hookworm burden, and the other part is derived from adult hookworm to decrease blood loss. The vaccine is designed to be used in combination with antihelminthic agents. Advantages of the vaccine are decreased reliance on antihelminthics, better results in areas where traditional methods have failed, and avoidance or reduction of drug-resistant strains of hookworm [76] . US phase I and phase II trials in endemic areas of Brazil are underway. Results are expected to be reported in 2007 and will lay the groundwork for larger clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this vaccine [76] .",
