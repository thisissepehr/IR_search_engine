T lymphocytes were the predominating inflammatory cells within the adventitial space. CD4 + T cells were more abundant than CD8 + T cells. Scattered IgG-, IgA-and IgM-containing cells were found in the adventitial space and surrounding neuropil, often adjacent to neurons. There was a markedly increased MHC class II expression in cells morphologically resembling microglia. In several cats, Borna disease virus specific antigen was detected, but only in a few ceils, mainly of macrophage character. Our findings indicate a long-standing inflammatory reaction in the CNS of cats with staggering disease, possibly triggered and sustained by a persistent viral infection.",

Viral infection is the presumed cause of this disease complex, although several attempts to isolate a virus have failed [42] . In Sweden, a feline neurological disorder commonly referred to as \"staggering disease\" has been observed since the early 1970s [24] . Clinical manifestations include motor disturbances and behavioral changes. The underlying lesion is a non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis, with predilection for the brain stem [28] . Although the histopathology as well as the clinical and laboratory findings strongly suggest a viral infection, evidence indicates that none of the known feline viruses capable of causing lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) of cats are involved [28] . Recently, a feline neurological disorder apparently identical to staggering disease was reported in Austria [44] . Despite extensive virological investigations, no virus could be isolated from the diseased cats.",

The findings of BDV-specific antibodies and antigen in human psychiatric patients indicate that BDV may be involved in the etiology of some mental disorders in man [3, 5, 36] . Recently it has been suggested that BDV may also be the cause of feline staggering disease, since more than 40% of cats with this disease in one study had serum antibodies to BDV [29] . The finding of BDV-specific antibodies prompted further investigations, which led to the detection and partial characterization of a feline BDV isolate from cats affected with staggering disease [9] .

Since this indicates a marked and long-standing immune reaction in the neural tissue, we decided to investigate the immune phenomena in the CNS of cats with this disease. The humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and the presence of BDV antigen in neural tissues were examined, using immunohistochemical methods. The results indicated that the adventitial inflammatory infiltrates of this meningoencephalomyelitis are T cell-dominated immune reactions, associated with marked immune activation of macrophages/microglial cells in the neural parenchyma. The present study also provided evidence suggesting that the immune response is triggered by a chronic infection. Furthermore, our results give credence to the previous notion that BDV or a BDV-like agent is involved in staggering disease.",

These cats were referred for euthanasia and necropsy from the University Clinics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Uppsala, or from private veterinary practitioners in Sweden, during 1991-1993. All cats were received alive by one of the authors (A.-L.L.) for re-assessment of the clinical diagnosis. The cats were between 1.5 and 7 years old (mean age 4 years) at the time of death. Eleven were domestic shorthairs or longhairs and 185 one an Abyssinian. Seven were neutered males and six were females. Major signs of the disease were hindleg incoordination, fluctuating fever, and mental changes. The duration of the disease varied between 2 weeks and 1.5 years (mean 3 months). To assess the effect of clinical duration upon the immunoreactivity, the cats were allocated to one of two groups: early disease (1-8 weeks, mean 4 weeks, n = 11) and late disease (10 and 18 months respectively, n = 2). Serum samples from all cats were negative for antibodies to feline coronavirus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and also negative for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus and the presence of feline leukemia virus antigen (Cite-Combo-Test, Idexx Corp., Portland, Me.). Serum was also analyzed for BDV antibodies by indirect immunofiuorescence as previously described [3] . Four cats (31%) had BDV-specific antibodies, with titers ranging between 1:20 and 1:80. All cats were killed by a pentobarbital overdose and then necropsied immediately. Nine cats 1-5 years old were used as controls for the immunohistochemical studies. Five of these, including two that were clinically healthy and devoid of lesions at necropsy, and three with lesions unrelated to the nervous system (pulmonary edema, traumatic injury, pyothorax), were killed and examined post mortem in the same way as the staggering disease cases. The remaining four cats were harrierbred, clinically healthy animals obtained from lffa-Credo, FArbresle, France. Heparinized blood from these cats was analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the reactivity to peripheral blood cells of the monoclonal antibodies used in the study.",

On average, CD3 + cells (Fig. 1 b) occurred frequently to predominantly in 73% of the ACs, while the corresponding figure for cells expressing B cell antigen (CD21-1ike) was 19% (Table 2 ). However, infiltrates with numerous B cells were just as common as those with numerous T cells in individual cases. Although the pan-T cell marker stained the majority of cells, in 189 most cases only occasional to scattered cells expressed CD4 or CD8 antigens. In three cases, CD4 + and CD8 + cells were present in similar amounts, while in the remaining ten cases CD4 \u00a7 cells were more abundant. Frequent to predominant occurrence of CD4 + cells was found in a minority of the ACs (mean 9%), and the corresponding figure for CD8 \u00a7 cells was only 0.6%. This paucity of CD8 + cells led us to apply another monoclonal antibody, OKT8 (VMRD, Pullman, Wash.), reactive with human CD8, but the results were similar. The antibody DH59B, which detects a molecule expressed on monocytes and macrophages, but presumably not on microglial cells (W Davis, personal communication), was reactive with occasional to scattered cells in many ACs (mean 61% of the cuffs). In no case did DH59B \u00a7 cells constitute the majority in any adventitial infiltrate. Occasional to scattered immunoglobulin-bearing cells were found within ACs in all cases (Table 3 ). By their morphological appearance, most of them were plasma cells. Some, however, were consistent with macrophages or large lymphoid cells. IgG + cells predominated, although IgA-and IgM-bearing immunocytes also occurred, even in the two chronic cases. The immunoglobulin-bearing cells were mainly located in the periphery of the ACs, from where they seemed to be migrating into the surrounding neuropil. The cell composition of the ACs was similar in different sections of the particular brain areas examined. A comparison between ACs from animals with a short (early) and those with a long (late) duration of clinical signs showed only slight differences, despite the fact that the signs had persisted for at least 10 months in the latter group. Cells expressing CD8 were notably sparse in late disease, whereas no significant difference in the percentage of CD3 + or CD4 + cells was observed between early and late disease.",

It should be noted that the pan-T cell marker used in this study (CF54A) has not yet been fully characterized. When applied to peripheral blood lymphocytes from control cats, using flow cytometry, this marker reacted with a population of cells (mean value 11.5%) which was neither CD4 + nor CD8 + (Table 1) . Recent flow cytometric studies indicate that some of these cells actually belong to the monocyte population (data not shown). Furthermore, it is possi-ble that a minor CD3 + CD4-CD8-T cell population might exist in cats, as it does in humans, where such cells express the CD7 phenotype and constitute a small population in the peripheral blood and the small intestine [3 I, 37 ]. An element of subjectivity in the interpretation of the results may also partly explain the discrepancy. A more accurate quantification of different sets of lymphocytes may be obtained by flow cytometry after extraction of mononuclear blood cells from the brain [22] .

Within the adventitial spaces, CD4 + T cells would have the opportunity to interact with MHC II + antigen-presenting macrophages, thereby triggering important immunological reactions [12] . It should be noted that normal cats seem to have an unusually high degree of MHC II expression not only on B cells, but also on resting T ceils [32, 34] . The strong MHC II expression within ACs in our cases could, therefore, be a phenomenon merely related to the presence of numerous lymphocytes. In the neural parenchyma, however, increased MHC II expression on cells resembling microglia was clearly observed in the diseased cats. This enhanced MHC I1 expression may be related to direct effects of Virus replication o1\" stimuli from lymphokines secreted by T cells [19] .",

In the present feline encephalitis, both the paucity of T cells in the neural parenchyma and the marked infiltration of microglial cells seem to indicate a similar pattern. However, the macrophage marker used (DH59B) failed to stain cells in the neuropil. It is possible that this antibody only labels a limited population of monocytes/macrophages and that the actual number of blood-derived macrophages could be considerably higher.

The finding of plasma cells in such close proximity to neurons suggests that antibodies may be involved in the mechanism of virus clearance from infected cells. Such antibody-mediated clearance of virus has been described in other encephalitides, e.g., rabies [11] , and Sindbis virus encephalitis in mice [19] . In the case of rabies, however, the antibody involved is a neutralizing and protective antibody which causes complete clearance of virus from the cells [11] . If a similar mechanism occurs in cats with staggering disease, it must be assumed that the antibody involved fails to clear the virus completely, at least allowing some persistence of viral RNA to account for the chronic nature of the disease.",

A mixed composition of cells in the adventitial space, strong expression of MHC class II antigen on macrophages/microglial cells and the presence of scattered plasma cells and B lymphocytes in the neural parenchyma, as found in the present cat encephalitis, are also features of experimental Borna disease in adult Lewis and Wistar rats [10, 33] . The paucity of BDV-specific antigen in the cat encephalitis argues against BDV as the causative agent. On the other hand, such antigen has recently been demonstrated in several cats with staggering disease in an ELISA using homogenized brain tissue (Bode and Lundgren, unpublished observation). It seems, however, that the amount of BDV antigen in cats, as shown in such antigen assays, is much smaller than in other animal species. Furthermore, preliminary studies have shown feline BDV to have a cell tropism in culture different from that of other BDV isolates [9, 27] . It is possible that cats with staggering disease carry BDV with an antigenic configuration that is altered by its adaptation to the cat, making the antibodies employed in our study insufficient for feline BDV detection. This notion is supported by the observation that BDV antigen is undetectable by immunohistochemistry in newborn Wistar rats, intracerebrally inoculated with homogenized brain suspensions from cats with staggering disease (Lundgren et al., submitted for publication). In contrast, after inoculation of brain suspensions from such infected newborn rats into adult rats, fullblown Borna disease with strong expression of BDV antigen occurs.",

This is in accordance with the sparsity of CD8 + T cells and the fact that no expression of MHC class I on neurons was observed in the cat brains. In contrast, neuronal lesions in BDV-infected Lewis rats are claimed to be caused by a virus-induced, cell-mediated immunopathological reaction mainly involving CD8 + T cells, rather than by the virus itself [2, 39] . This notion is supported by the facts that BDV lacks a cytolytic effect in tissue cultures and that in the acute phase of the disease, the lytic effect in vivo is not strongly expressed [39] . It has been shown, however, that at a later stage of Borna disease severe widespread cytopathic changes occur in the neurons [18] . Since the role of BDV in feline staggering disease is not clear, it is not possible at this stage to determine the importance of these mechanisms for the neuronal lesions in the cat encephalitis.",
