The developed CAD system in this study is based on 1) fast localization of candidate imaging patterns using local scale information of the images, and 2) M\u00f6bius invariant feature extraction method based on learned local shape and texture properties of TIB patterns. For fast localization of candidate imaging patterns, we use ball-scale filtering and, based on the observation of the pattern of interest, a suitable scale selection is used to retain only small size patterns. Once candidate abnormality patterns are identified, we extract proposed shape features from regions where at least one candidate pattern occupies. The comparative evaluation of the proposed method with commonly used CAD methods is presented with a dataset of 60 chest CTs (laboratory confirmed 39 viral bronchiolitis human parainfluenza CTs and 21 normal chest CTs). The quantitative results are presented as the area under the receiver operator characteristics curves and a computer score (volume affected by TIB) provided as an output of the CAD system. In addition, a visual grading scheme is applied to the patient data by three well-trained radiologists. Interobserver and observer-computer agreements are obtained by the relevant statistical methods over different lung zones. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CAD system can achieve high detection rates with an overall accuracy of 90.96%. Moreover, correlations of observer-observer (R 2 = 0.8848, p < 0.01) and observer-CAD agreements (R 2 = 0.824, p < 0.01) validate the feasibility of the use of the proposed CAD system in detecting and quantifying TIB patterns.",

Although none of these visual patterns are specific for one pathogen, the amount of lung volume exhibiting these features could provide insights into the extent or severity of infection. Among these patterns, TIB opacities, represented by thickened bronchial structures surrounded locally by clusters of 2-3 mm micronodules, are associated with inflammation of the small airways (bronchioles), such as in viral or bacterial bronchiolitis, and the increasing sizes of abnormal regions on CT can suggest the progression of disease [6] . Often considered to have a limited differential diagnosis-M TB infection, infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria, viral infection, cystic fibrosis, this pattern is recognized as a CT appearance of many different entities. Unlike the other imaging patterns such as GGO and consolidations, it is an extremely challenging task to detect and quantify the regions with TIB opacities due to interobserver variations and inconsistent visual scoring methods [2] . Therefore, an accurate method for detecting TIB is a critical in computer-assisted detection (CAD) schemes from chest CT. Although the correct diagnosis for TIB pattern is very important, it is also one of the most difficult tasks for radiologists because the contrast of lesions is often low and the disease patterns are very complex. All these limitations suggest that CAD could make a valuable contribution to the management of respiratory tract infections by assisting in the early recognition of pulmonary parenchymal lesions and providing quantitative measures of disease severity.

TIB patterns, in particular, usually represent the disease of the small airways such as infectious-inflammatory bronchiolitis as well as bronchiolar luminal impaction with mucus, pus, cells, or fluid causing normally invisible peripheral airways to become visible on CT [7] . Fig. 1 shows typical TIB patterns in a chest CT ( Fig. 1 shows labeled TIB patterns with blue). As its name implies, this pattern resembles a budding tree in CT due to the branching opacities with adjacent centrilobular nodularity [2] . It is not specific for a single disease entity, but suggests pathology in the peripheral airways, which can be associated with air trapping or subsegmental consolidation in the surrounding alveolar airspaces. Because any organism that infects the small airways can cause a TIB pattern, pulmonary infections are its most common cause.",

This process comes from a learning perspective such that the size, shape, and textural characteristics of TIB patterns are learned a priori. The candidate selection process removes large homogeneous regions from consideration which results in a rapid localization of candidate TIB patterns. The local regions enclosing candidate TIB patterns are then used to extract shape and texture features for automatic detection; 2) another novel aspect in this study is to extract M\u00f6bius invariant local shape features (i.e., Willmore energy-based features). Extracted local shape features are combined with statistical texture features to classify lung tissues. In addition, we also investigate the extraction and use of different local shape features as compared to the proposed shape features to facilitate local structure analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses automatic detection of TIB patterns for a CAD system in infectious lung diseases. Since there is no published work on automatic detection of TIB patterns in the literature, we compare our proposed CAD system on the basis of different feature sets previously shown to be successful in detecting lung diseases in general. Early version of this study appeared in [3] , and can be accessed in [8] .",

In this study, one seed per lung volume (i.e., left or right) is automatically set by only considering the locations of small intensity valued voxels inside the body region (see [9] for a detailed description of the use of FC in anatomy segmentation). Fig. 3 (middle and right) shows the resulting segmentation of the chest CT given on the left. Although we use FC algorithm to segment lung regions, there are many well-established lung segmentation methods in the literature [9] - [11] , [29] , and [41] such that they could possibly be used as well to accomplish the delineation step.

In other words, TIB patterns do not constitute sufficiently large homogeneous regions. Thus, TIB patterns are localized only in the vicinity of small homogeneous regions, and their boundaries have high curvatures due to the nature of its complex shape.

The b-scale is the simplest form of a locally adaptive scale where the scene is partitioned into several scale levels. Every voxel in each scale is assigned the size of the local structure it belongs. For instance, voxels within the large homogeneous objects have highest scale values, and the voxels nearby the boundary of objects have small-scale values. Voxels on the boundary of objects have smallest scale values. Because of these observations, we conclude that TIB Fig. 4(c) .

Note that mean curvature measure is the trace of local Hessian matrix H e . Mean curvature can be thought as a negative gradient (as a Laplacian) of the area functional due to its nice variational interpretation over the surface. This does not only give insights into the size of the local shape but also into the total symmetrical deviation from the sphere. Mean curvature is translation and rotation invariant, but not scale invariant. 4) Elongation: Shape elongation is one of the basic shape descriptors and it indicates flatness measure of the local shape [28] . In this paper, we used the ratio of principal curvatures to measure elongation as \u03ba 2 /\u03ba 1 with \u03ba 2 \u2264 \u03ba 1 . Elongation measure is invariant with respect to a similarity transformation, and therefore, it is a robust feature that helps to identify curvilinear shapes.

Distortion is a valuable image analysis property revealed by magnitude difference of principal curvatures. Distortion measure captures the deviation of principal curvatures, thus nonplanarity of a region. Together with Gaussian or mean curvature, distortion measure brings further information into encoding of local shape. Distortion measure is translation and rotation invariant, but not scale invariant. 6) Shear: The shear is another algebraic distortion quantity defined as proportional to the normalized distortion: (\u03ba 1 \u2212 \u03ba 2 ) 2 /4. The physical information contained in the shear is basically the same as that of the distortion; it is related to distortion with powers of the difference of principal curvatures. Different than distortion, shear descriptor captures higher degree of nonplanarity of a region due to having more robustness against noise. 7) Compactness: Compactness feature measures the similarity between shape of interest and a perfect ellipse, and is defined as 1/(4\u03c0 \u221a \u03ba 1 \u03ba 2 ). Note that this ratio is a dimensionless ratio between the area of the shape (1 for a normalized shape) and the area of the best ellipse fitting the shape. Note also that the compactness measure is invariant to affine transformations and parametrically related to Gaussian curvature.

Based on the observations of spatial properties of the selected candidate patterns, it becomes apparent that instead of using conventional high-dimensional feature extraction methods such as Gabor wavelets, steerable wavelets, etc., one may extract much fewer and more reliable statistical features to discriminate the pattern of interest. Motivated from the fact that TIB patterns consist of numerous small (or micro-) nodules nearby the main curvilinear structure and those small structures have varying opacities, the location and distribution of those small structures can be obtained by simple thresholding method which has been popular in estimation for more than two decades [30] . However, since the opacities are varying through different nodular structures, it is challenging to find an optimum threshold value. Therefore, instead of using one single threshold level, we empirically choose n = 10 different threshold levels (\u03bb j ) to obtain local statistics of those structures in a hierarchical way, where \u03bb j = 10j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 10 [31] . This process is named LGS because we extract different statistical measurements in gradient of the images.

Fig. 7 shows an example thresholding process over a candidate TIB pattern centered at c (only for four levels are shown for demonstration purpose). After different threshold levels are applied over the local regions of b-scale images, resultant thresholded local patches are used to extract the following features: mean SI values of the local patch for each thresholding level (one feature), and the number of bscale patterns left after thresholding process (one feature). Since we use ten different thresholding levels, we extract 20 features totally. Moreover, for a local region centered at a voxel c of a candidate TIB pattern, we extract one global feature as an SI value of the voxel c, three features as the maximum, minimum, and mean SI values over the local region prior to thresholding. Therefore, a total of 24 features (LGS+SI) are extracted from a typical local patch to be used in CAD system [4] . Although n and \u03bb j are chosen empirically based on the observations of shape and textural characteristics of normal and TIB patterns during the training step, one may propose to use cross validation, control of the global and local false discovery rate, and uncertainty principles to decide those parameters near-optimally [30] .",

Zone 2 extended from the tracheal carina to the left atrium's junction with inferior pulmonary veins. Zone 3 included the remainder of the lungs below the level of the inferior pulmonary veins atrial junction. A severity score (0 to 5 such that 0 indicates no abnormality) was assigned to each zone based on the percentage of the zone occupied as listed in Fig. 8 (second row). A total score was also extracted by considering all zones during visual grading. Consensus visual scores 2 from participating radiologists [one with more than nine years of experience (DMJ) and one with more than one year of experience (AW)] on a scale of 0-5 over lungs were recorded and compared with computer scores (of the proposed CAD system). Following the same visual scoring scheme, another participating radiologist [with more than seven years of experience (OA)], who was blinded to the consensus visual scores previously obtained, was involved in the visual grading process to provide information on interobserver variability.",

Table I summarizes the performance of the proposed CAD system as compared to other feature sets. The performances are reported as the areas under the ROC curves (A z ). Note that proposed shape features (i.e., Willmore energy and parametrically related local shape features) alone are superior to other methods even though the dimension of the proposed shape feature is only 8. The best performance is obtained when we combine the proposed shape and GLCM features. This is to be expected because spatial statistics are incorporated into the shape features such that texture and shape features are often complementary to each other. On the other hand, compared to the proposed shape features, the LGS and SI features have lower detection rates because they are not affine (and M\u00f6bius) invariant and eventually having difficulty in appreciating the large amount of details of TIB patterns. Another reason is that there is no optimal choice of thresholding process and this may yield less remarkable statistical measurements over local patches. However, the LGS and SI features alone perform better than the high-dimensional conventional features similar to the proposed shape features. This result itself suggests the use of local shape features and their adapted extensions in detection of TIB patterns.",

Similarly, it is practical to discard voxels with high b-scale values from the candidate selection procedure. Figs. 2 (candidate selection) and 4(a) show selected b-scale regions as candidate TIB patterns. Once b-scale image correspondence of segmented chest CT is obtained as noted in Fig. 4(a), we only select small b-scale values via thresholding the large b-scale values [see Fig. 4(b)].
