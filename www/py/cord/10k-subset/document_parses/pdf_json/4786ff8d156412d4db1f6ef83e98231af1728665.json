Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) and complex coacervates are phase separation phenomena that lead to the selective partitioning of biomolecules and have recently been proposed as membrane-free protocell models. We show in this study through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy that despite the ability of such systems to effectively concentrate RNA, there is a high rate of RNA exchange between phases in dextran/polyethylene glycol ATPS and ATP/poly-L-lysine coacervate droplets. In contrast to fatty acid vesicles, these systems would not allow effective segregation and consequent evolution of RNA, thus rendering these systems ineffective as model protocells.",

When the ATPS was mixed by vortexing, a turbid suspension consisting of small, dispersed dextran-rich droplets in the bulk PEG-rich phase and PEG-rich droplets in the bulk dextran-rich phase formed. After several minutes the droplets began to coalesce and the system separated into two clear phases (Fig. S1b) , with the dextran-rich phase at the bottom due to its greater density. Whether the system was in a dispersed or a coalesced state, we observed a rapid 8-fold enrichment of a fluorescently labeled RNA 15-mer into the dextran-rich phase; the fluorescent dye did not have a strong effect on partitioning (Table S1) .",

As expected, both of the PEG/dextran derivative systems lead to a greater degree of partitioning of RNA (Table S1 ). In a 25 % DEAE-dextran/25 % PEG (w/v) system (yielding\u224855 % DEAE-dextran-rich phase by volume), RNA partitioned strongly into the DEAE-dextran-rich phase due to the positive charge of the DEAE-dextran and the more polar nature of that phase; the degree of partitioning was so great that the RNA concentration in the PEG-rich phase was below our detection limit (Table S1 ). Conversely, in a 16 % dextransulfate/10 % PEG (w/v) system (\u224860 % dextran-sulfate-rich phase by volume), RNA partitioned strongly into the PEG-rich phase, presumably due to charge repulsion from the anionic dextran-sulfate. Droplets in the DEAE-dextran/PEG system coalesced more slowly than droplets in the dextran/PEG or dextran-sulfate/PEG system (Fig. S3 ), most likely due to the high viscosity of DEAE-dextran. In all systems, renewed vortexing or mixing led to the reformation of the turbid state consisting of small, dispersed droplets.",

Following coalescence, the lower, more dense phase was highly enriched in ATP/pLys complexes formed by the charge balancing of these species (Fig. S4b ). In order for coacervates to form, a number of parameters must fall within defined limits, including the ATP and pLys concentrations (Koga et al. 2011), salt concentrations (Fig. S5) , nucleotides (Table S2) , and the molecular weight of the pLys (Table S2) .

At steady state, this would be equivalent to the rate at which RNA diffused out of droplets into the bulk phase (and then into other droplets). We acquired and analyzed fluorescence recovery data for fluorescently labeled RNA in droplets from four systems (Table S3) : 16 % dextran/10 % PEG (Fig. 1a , Movie S1), 25 % DEAEdextran/25 % PEG (Fig. 1b and 30 mM ATP/2 % pLys (Fig. 1d , Movie S4) (all percentages w/v).

            "text": "To compare the time scale of RNA retention between phase-separated droplet systems and fatty acid vesicles, we prepared oleic acid vesicles, similar in size to the droplets studied above, that contained the fluorescently labeled RNA 15-mer. For the vesicle experiments, a high concentration of fluorescently labeled RNA was present outside of the vesicles as well. Ten minutes after photobleaching a sample, the external solution had fully recovered in fluorescence intensity due to the diffusion of RNA from adjacent non-bleached sample regions. However, the vesicles did not regain any detectable internal fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2 , Movie S5). As expected, fatty acid vesicles, despite being more permeable to charged species than phospholipid vesicles, did not exhibit measurable permeability for RNA oligomers. The rate of RNA exchange across a fatty acid vesicle membrane was several orders of magnitude slower than the rate of RNA exchange across the boundaries of ATPS or coacervate droplets. Normalized fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) recovery curves are shown at right. All samples contained 5 \u03bcM 5\u2032-6-FAM-labeled RNA 15-mer (5\u2032-CCAGUCAGUCUACGC-3\u2032) in: (a) 16 % dextran 9-11 kDa/10 % PEG 8 kDa in 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 and 100 mM NaCl (indicated droplet 25 \u03bcm diameter), (b) 25 % DEAE-dextran >500 kDa/25 % PEG 8 kDa in 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 with the GODCAT (glucose oxidase/ catalase) system (Methods) (indicated droplet 9.5 \u03bcm diameter), (c) 16 % dextran-sulfate 9-20 kDa/10 % PEG 8 kDa in 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 and 100 mM NaCl (indicated droplet 44 \u03bcm diameter), (d) 30 mM ATP/2 % pLys 4-15 kDa in 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 with the GODCAT system (Methods) (indicated droplet 7.5 \u03bcm diameter). See Movies S1-S4 for respective FRAP movies. Each curve was normalized to the intensities of a non-bleached droplet and the background within the same frame, to correct for photobleaching during sampling, as well as to its initial intensity, to account for variable photobleaching before the recovery step across runs (Supplementary Information). Data were fit to a single exponential to determine time constants (\u03c4) and half-lives (t 1/2 ) for fluorescence recovery (Supplementary Information). Further details and data in Table S3 . Scale bars for (a) and (c) are 100 \u03bcm; scale bars for (b) and (d) are 10 \u03bcm. See Movies S1-S4 for full movies of photobleaching and recovery for each of the indicated droplets in (a)-(d), respectively. All percentages are w/v This observation clearly demonstrates that although dextran/PEG ATPS and ATP/pLys coacervate systems are able to concentrate RNA molecules through partitioning into droplets, their ability to compartmentalize these oligomers over time scales longer than seconds was insignificant compared to that of fatty acid vesicles.",

We were able to encapsulate a dextran/ PEG ATPS inside oleic acid vesicles (Fig. 3) . As expected, the fluorescently labeled RNA 15mer partitioned into the dextran-rich phase inside oleate vesicles, providing an RNA-rich compartment within these vesicles. However, the ATP/pLys system used in this study was not compatible with fatty acids. Attempts to produce fatty acid vesicles containing the ATP/pLys system resulted in quantitative precipitation of the fatty acids, most likely due to the charge interactions between the cationic lysine side chain and anionic fatty acid molecules.",

            "text": "For the ATPS and coacervate droplets studied, exchange of RNA across the droplet boundary occurred orders of magnitude more rapidly than across the membrane of fatty acid vesicles. Although our FRAP measurements report only on the entry of RNA oligomers into ATPS or coacervate droplets, at steady state, the rate of efflux of RNA from droplets must equal the rate of influx. Our data therefore imply that RNA molecules do not remain localized within any droplet for longer than a period of seconds, and rapidly exchange between droplets via the surrounding bulk phase. Although a larger RNA such as a ribozyme would diffuse more slowly in solution due to its greater mass, our data indicates that longer RNAs will not reside in a droplet for a significantly longer time before diffusing out of the droplet. Fast RNA exchange b a Fig. 2 Oleic acid vesicles do not exchange RNA with the surrounding fluid. Representative confocal microscope images of a sample (a) before photobleaching and (b) 590 s after photobleaching of the indicated non-gel-filtered oleic acid vesicle in 200 mM Bicine-NaOH pH 8.5 containing 5\u2032-6-FAM labeled RNA 15-mer (5\u2032-CCAGUCAG UCUACGC-3\u2032) at room temperature (Methods). The vesicle samples were not gel filtered in order to maintain a high RNA concentration outside of the vesicles in order to simulate conditions similar to the ATPS and coacervate systems. After the entire window was photobleached, fluorescence outside of the vesicles recovered due to rapid RNA diffusion, but fluorescence inside vesicles did not recover due to lack of transport of RNA across the membrane. Scale bars, 10 \u03bcm. See Movie S5 for full movie of photobleaching and recovery coupled with the observed rapid coalescence of droplets suggests that ATPS and coacervate droplets would not confer the stable compartmentalization necessary for multiple generations of RNA selection and replication to occur, which would need to be on the order of many hours, if not days (Deck et al. 2011; Adamala and Szostak 2013b) . If a given RNA molecule only resides in a particular droplet for a short period of time before exchanging into a different droplet, the products of any functional activity of that RNA (such as the catalytic production of a useful metabolite) would be spread across many droplets, and furthermore would not be heritable. In essence, the rapid exchange of RNA molecules between droplets is equivalent to a lack of compartmentalization in a time-averaged sense. Darwinian evolution requires compartmentalization so that mutations that improve function can lead to a selective advantage for the mutant genomic molecule. As the capacity for Darwinian evolution is a basic requirement for any protocell model, it is clear that unmodified ATPS and coacervate droplets are unsuitable protocell models.",

            "text": "To decrease the rate of RNA exchange between droplets, it may be productive to consider systems in which RNA molecules could covalently attach to a matrix or to particles that would stay localized within a droplet. Many RNA affinity purification techniques rely on covalent attachments to a matrix such as sepharose (Allerson et al. 2003) or agarose beads (Caputi et al. 1999 ) and such a system could serve to slow RNA exchange. The coacervate system we studied was composed of a simple polypeptide (pLys) and a simple mononucleotide (ATP). RNA-protein (Lee et al. 1977; Drygin 1998; Baskerville and Bartel 2002) or RNA-nucleotide (Fl\u00fcgel and Wells 1972; Fl\u00fcgel et al. 1973 ) covalent interactions produced by photocrosslinking could be good starting points to develop a system in which RNA becomes covalently linked to a matrix within coacervate droplets in a prebiotically plausible manner. Alternatively, utilizing a poly(Arg) matrix could result in tightly bound RNA that is unable to diffuse away from the droplet due to the electrostatic interactions between the arginine . Images in the top row were acquired sequentially using an epifluorescence microscope; images in the bottom row were acquired simultaneously using confocal microscopy. Cy5-labeled RNA partitioned strongly into the dextran-rich phase, and HPTS partitioned into the PEG-rich phase. The dextran-rich (red) and the PEG-rich (green) phases could separate spontaneously within an oleic acid vesicle. See Methods for details. Scale bars, 3 \u03bcm side-chains and the RNA backbone (Knight and Landweber 1998) . Other immobilization techniques that take advantage of the ability of RNA to form base-pairs could also serve to slow RNA exchange. Although dextran/PEG ATPS and ATP/pLys coacervate systems do not provide suitably stable compartmentalization of reactants for long periods of time, such systems do enable transient localization and concentration of RNA molecules. Focusing on the potential usefulness of these systems for sub-compartmentalization within protocells may be a productive direction for future research (Hyman and Brangwynne 2011) . Fatty acid and phospholipid vesicle systems compatible with dextran/PEG ATPSs have been developed (Helfrich et al. 2002; Long et al. 2005; Dominak et al. 2010 ; this study), and it may be possible to develop similar vesicle systems that are compatible with the ATP/pLys coacervate system. This might be achieved by using net-neutral zwitterionic phospholipids or non-ionic amphiphiles as membrane forming molecules, as they would not interact strongly with the coacervate components, thus avoiding precipitation. Such a system would be similar to cellular organelle-based compartmentalization. In a prebiotic setting, a lipid-based membrane could encapsulate all components, and selective chemical partitioning into the two phases could provide an early protocell with the ability to partition compounds internally and accelerate reactions within the protocell, including for example the assembly of RNA complexes and ribozyme catalysis (Strulson et al. 2012) . Thus, understanding how ATPSs and coacervates interact and combine with fatty acid and phospholipid vesicles may lead to a greater understanding of the possibilities for the development of early cells in an RNA world.",

The 16 %w/v dextran-sulfate sodium salt 9-20 kDa and 10 %w/v PEG 8 kDa was prepared by dissolving the solid components in a solution of 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 and 100 mM NaCl with moderate vortexing for several seconds. The 25 %w/v DEAE-dextran hydrochloride >500 kDa and 25 %w/v PEG 8 kDa was prepared by dissolving the solid components in a solution of 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 with vigorous vortexing and heating to 65 o C for several minutes. 30 mM ATP -2 %w/v pLys (either 1-5 kDa, 4-15 kDa, or 15-30 kDa as indicated) was prepared by mixing respective stock solutions (200 mM ATP and 10 % or 50 %w/v pLys both in 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8) and diluting with 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8. All samples were prepared in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes at room temperature. Due to the viscosity of the DEAEdextran/PEG sample, pipet tips that were cut roughly 1 cm from the tip were used for that sample. To each sample, 5\u2032-6-FAM-labeled RNA (5\u2032-CCAGUCAGUCUACGC-3\u2032 or 5\u2032-CAUCUAGUUACCUCUAGGAUCUCAUGAUGCCUGAAGCGUAGACUGACUGG-3\u2032) from a 100 \u03bcM stock solution in nuclease-free water was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM RNA. Each solution was vortexed for 30 s. For applications that required the two phases to be separated, the sample tube was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Each phase was then pipetted into separate tubes. Transmittance measurements were performed using a GE Healthcare (formerly Amersham) Ultrospec 3,100 pro UV-Visible spectrometer (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). RNA phase-specific partitioning measurements were performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) Nanodrop 2000c Spectrophotometer. For confocal microscopy, DEAE-dextran/PEG and ATP/pLys samples also contained the GODCAT system (Glucose Oxidase-Catalase) to reduce photobleaching (Hentrich and Surrey 2010) , and included 2 %w/v D-(+)-glucose, 0.5 mg/mL catalase, 1 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 143 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. A 6-8 \u03bcL droplet (6 \u03bcL for dextran/PEG, dextransulfate/PEG samples, and ATP/pLys samples, and 8 \u03bcL for DEAE-dextran/PEG samples) for each sample was applied to each glass slide (25x75mm) and a cover slip (18x18mm, No. 1) was applied. The slide was allowed to sit at room temperature until the droplet applied was completely spread across the entire cover slip area, and then the cover slip was sealed using Valap (1:1:1 vaseline, lanolin, paraffin wax) to avoid evaporation. Samples were covered with aluminum foil to reduce photobleaching by stray light until imaging.",

The solution was vigorously vortexed and visually inspected to verify that it contained only one phase. Subsequently, 3 \u03bcL of oleic acid were added to the solution and after another vigorous vortexing, the solution was tumbled over night on a rotating wheel (6 rpm) to allow vesicle formation. The next day, the vesicles were purified from unencapsulated dye and RNA using a short 1 cm Sepharose 4B gel filtration column and 1 mM oleic acid in 200 mM bicine (adjusted to pH 8.5 with NaOH) as a running buffer. 6 \u03bcL of gel-filtered vesicles were spread out (to around 1 cm 2 ) on a 25x75 mm microscope slide and the droplet was allowed to evaporate for 6 min at room temperature. Then an 18x18mm coverslip was placed onto the droplet and the slide was sealed using Valap. Alternatively, a 3 \u03bcL droplet was placed on a slide and a coverslip was placed immediately on top of it. In this case, the coverslip was not sealed, but only fixed in the corners with Valap, and evaporation was allowed to occur through the edges over several hours. Slides were observed either with a confocal microscope (see below) or with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) TE2000 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 100\u00d7 oil objective.",

Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica (Solms, Germany) SP5 AOBS Scanning Laser Confocal Microscope (63\u00d7, 1.4-0.6 N. A. Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective or 20\u00d7, 0.7 N.

Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective), or a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) A1R Confocal Microscope (60\u00d7, 1.49 N. A. Apochromat TIRF oil immersion objective). After selection of the droplet to be analyzed, a time zero image was acquired, and then a circular or square region was photobleached at high power using an Argon laser at 488 nm (or a solid state laser for the Nikon system). Each photobleaching region was chosen to be as small as possible while still containing a single, whole droplet to minimize collateral photobleaching of neighboring droplets. The fluorescence intensity (either 493 nm to 543 nm on the Leica system, 505 nm to 530 nm on the Zeiss system, or 500 nm to 550 nm on the Nikon system) was then measured over time to track the fluorescence recovery of 5\u2032-6-FAM-labeled RNA molecules within the droplet of interest.",

These intensities were normalized to the intensities of a non-bleached droplet and the background within the same frame, to correct for nonspecific photobleaching during sampling. The intensities were then normalized to the initial intensity of the droplet analyzed, to account for variable photobleaching before the recovery step across runs (Phair et al. 2004) . Curves were then fit to a single exponential recovery function. See Supplemental Information for detailed explanation of image analysis and curve fitting. All imaging visualization, analysis, calculations, and production of movies were performed using FIJI (Fiji is Just ImageJ). All curve fitting was performed using MATLAB (Natick, MA). All figures were produced using Adobe Illustrator (San Jose, CA).",
