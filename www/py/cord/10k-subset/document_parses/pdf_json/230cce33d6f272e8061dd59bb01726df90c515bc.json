The rates of patient and graft survival are lower in ABO-I transplants than in ABO-compatible (ABO-C) transplants because of antibody-mediated rejection events, such as vascular thrombosis and ischemic bile duct complications. Recently, encouraging results have been achieved with new strategies to reduce posttransplant-specific hemagglutinin titers, including reinforced immunosuppression, splenectomy, and the use of rituximab [1, 2] . At our institution, we have developed local infusion therapy with methylprednisolone and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to ameliorate endothelial injury by antibody-mediated reactions. Methylprednisolone and PGE1 have been infused through the hepatic artery, and acceptable outcomes have been achieved in adult ABO-I LDLT with rituximab prophylaxis in 2006 [3] . The proportion of memory phenotype in T cells of recipients before transplantation can vary greatly according to exposure to environmental antigens and a decreasing ability to mediate effective immune responses to newly encountered antigens with increasing age [4] . In particular, a preexisting memory pool, produced by a host's history of infection, is more likely to affect the course of infection and be a potential barrier for tolerance induction, a phenomenon termed heterologous immunity [5, 6] . Accordingly, it is very important to clarify how preexisting memory T cells affect the defense against repeated infections and pathogens that have not been encountered previously and repeat infections. Our previous studies have shown that the probability of survival and the frequency of infection after LDLT are closely related to the effector T cell population of circulating CD8 ? T cells before LDLT [7] and that CD4 ? cells play an important role in CD8 ? T cell differentiation [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 658, "end": 661, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 662, "end": 664, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1020, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1287, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1521, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1524, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1934, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2014, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "To improve the outcome of ABO-I LDLT, high-risk patients should be avoided, if they can be identified.

Accordingly, the downregulation of perforin expression associated with the depletion of effector T cells indicates cytotoxicitydeficiency, resulting in an acceleration of posttransplant infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "After Tacrolimus Administration"}, {"text": "After tacrolimus administration in the ABO-I or ABO-C group I recipients, the capacities of CD8 ? effector T cells in response to infections were maintained as fully functional populations capable of immediate synthesis of perforin. Upon encountering an antigen, these CD8 ? T cells were highly cytolytic, even after immunosuppression. In contrast, in ABO-C group III and ABO-I groups II and III recipients, the cytotoxic ability of CD8 ? effector T cells was significantly decreased and, thus, ensured an uncontrollable infection. In particular, such excessive down-regulation of cytotoxicity was associated with a markedly impaired ability of the recipient to eradicate the infection and an increased vulnerability to additional invading pathogens in group III. When the down-regulation of effector T cells continues for a prolonged period after LDLT, as shown in ABO-I group III recipients, with time the effector T cells seem to be driven to an ''exhausted'' phenotypic and functional state, culminating in the deletion of responding cells. Lastly, This mechanism could operate to silence antiviral or bacterial T cell responses. Conversely, high bacterial and viral loads were associated with the ablation of CD8 ? effector T cell responses and with impaired cytokine production, as proposed by Wherry et al. [23] . Thus, a marked down-regulation of effector T cells and perforin expression plays a greater role in determining survival probability. Furthermore, such functions of CD8 ? effector T cells were determined by the preexisting CD8 1 T cell differentiation phenotype before LDLT. These findings are consistent with the greater frequencies of donor-specific memory T cells in the peripheral blood at the time of transplantation being associated with poor allograft outcome [24] . The Relationship Between Infection and Rejection Related to Tacrolimus Immunosuppression", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1314, "end": 1318, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1791, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "After Tacrolimus Administration"}, {"text": "The frequencies of posttransplant infection, LTCs, and hospital mortality were significantly higher in ABO-I recipients than in ABO-C recipients. ABO-I recipients were more likely to develop life-threatening complications, mainly sepsis, after surgical complications. Once this occurs in ABO-I recipients, the outcome of surgical complications would be seriously compromised by a high rate of severe infection. Over immunosuppression, especially use of large amounts of corticosteroids, may also be one of the factors inducing severe infectious complication. Interestingly, in ABO-I group II and III recipients the frequencies of posttransplant infection were higher than in ABO-C group II and III recipients. However, the ACR rates tended to be suppressed in ABO-I group II and III recipients. These decreased ACR rates are due to tacrolimus administration inducing greater inhibition of both effector cell generation and CTL cytotoxicity in ABO-I group II and III recipients than in ABO-C recipients. In ABO-I group II and III recipients, the tacrolimus immunosuppression, although suppressing ACR development, contributes to a catastrophic effect on the development of infection. Accordingly, to avoid a prolonged down-regulation of effector T cells, tacrolimus should be adjusted to tailor the immunosuppression for each recipient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "After Tacrolimus Administration"}, {"text": "Based on our current experience, AMR can often be prevented by hepatic artery infusion therapy and rituximab prophylaxis. However, higher frequencies of effector T cells in the peripheral blood at the time of the transplantation, possibly with an extensive history of environmental exposure, were associated with poor allograft outcome. The reduction of posttransplant infection is a key to improve the outcome of ABO-I LDLT. Accordingly, it is of very high importance to prevent the marked down-regulation of effector T cells by a promising device to adjust immunosuppression. Despite appropriate tacrolimus trough levels, differences in the down-regulation of effector T cells occurred between ABO-C and ABO-I recipients. This may provide important insights that the marked down-regulation of effector T cells is due to the highest negative sensitivity to tacrolimus administration. In this regard, there were marked differences in group II between ABO-C and ABO-I recipients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Impact of Immunosuppression on Immune Status of ABO-I Group II"}, {"text": "The effector T cells were not down-regulated after tacrolimus administration in ABO-C group II but were decreased significantly in ABO-I group II, indicating higher negative sensitivity to tacrolimus in this group. In ABO-I group II, the posttransplant course was more often compromised by LTCs, although there were no hospital mortalities. Immunosuppressive agents differ in their ability to control the generation and function of CD8 ? memory T cells; for this purpose, calcineurin inhibitors are the most efficacious. However, the mechanism of the high negative sensitivity to tacrolimus in the recipients with preexisting effector T cells is unclear. On the other hand, the marked down-regulation of effector T cells was associated with a decrease in IFN-c expression (data not shown). Experimental studies have found that in mice with high IFN-c production, calcineurin-inhibitor therapy effectively induces long-term graft survival after cardiac allografting, whereas in IFN-c-deficient mice the same therapy only marginally prolongs graft survival and induces a resistance to calcineurin inhibitors [25, 26] . Accordingly, it seems likely that CTL cytotoxicity cannot effectively respond to tacrolimus therapy during down-regulation of IFN-c production in effector-enriched recipients. This indicates the importance of tailoring immunosuppressants for transplant recipients, particularly those with very high levels of preexisting immunological memory. However, there is no reliable approach to prevent the impairment of CTL cytotoxicity in transplantation. A promising strategy may be to meticulously adjust the minimum immunosuppression for each recipient. Because % effector difference was decreased by day 2, when reaching appropriate trough levels of tacrolimus, more accurate assessment of the recipient's immune status may help to tailor immunosuppression for high-risk recipients and may prevent graft failure in selected patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1106, "end": 1110, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1114, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Impact of Immunosuppression on Immune Status of ABO-I Group II"}, {"text": "In group I of both ABO-C and ABO-I recipients, the CD8 ?
