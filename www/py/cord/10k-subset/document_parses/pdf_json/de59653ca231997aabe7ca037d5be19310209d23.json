            "text": "Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by developmental deficits that produce impairments of personal, social, academic or occupational functioning. Objective: To access the educational attainment, employment status and personal autonomy among adolescents aged 17-20 years followed in the neurodevelopment clinic of a tertiary hospital. Methods: A telephonic survey was elaborated and conducted to assess educational level, employment status, professional internship enrolment, parental sensation of personal autonomy and other features like getting a bank account or a driving licence. Patients born in 1999 and 2000 followed in our centre from 2009 to 2018 were included. Clinical information comprising diagnosis, comorbidities and age at the first and the last appointments were retrieved from personal records. Results: Fifty-two of 83 eligible patients (63%) responded to the survey; 69% were boys. The results were analysed by three major diagnosis groups i.e. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (n=10), Intellectual Disability (ID) (n=13) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (n=21). Concerning educational attainment, the majority were attending high school or higher levels of education (ASD 100%, ID 54% and ADHD 76%). Regarding employment the majority were enrolled in a professional internship or were employed (ASD 40%, ID 46% and ADHD 52%), while the rest were living at home under parental care or attending occupational centre activities. Parental sensation of personal autonomy was achieved in 60% of ASD, 54% of ID and 100% of ADHD patients. The number of adolescents obtaining a driving licence (ASD 40%, ID 15% and ADHD 85%) and owning/managing a bank account (ASD 40%/0%, ID 38%/15% and ADHD 90%/40%) were heterogenous among the groups. Conclusion: Educational levels, employment possibilities and personal autonomy have been increasing among patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, however, vary significantly and depend on disorder itself and its severity. A better guidance is needed to support these adolescents in the transition to adulthood.",

Over the years 2007 till 2016 we conducted a longitudinal study by monitoring the intake and treatment of 5,893 adolescents in all Dutch Pediatric Departments. Methods: from 2007 till 2016 data were collected on all adolescents (aged younger than 18 and with a positive BAC), treated in all Pediatric Departments in The Netherlands. The Dutch Pediatric Surveillance System (NSCK) consists of a system in which all pediatricians report all admitted adolescents by completing a questionnaire, making use of a patient interview. Results: 5,893 adolescents were treated in totally, most of them (4,678; 88%) related to severe alcohol intoxication; mean age was 15.4 years, and 48 % were girls. BAC level increased during this period (1.82 in 2007 and 2.01 in 2016) , and reduced consciousness lasted from 2.24 hours in 2007 till 3.12 hours in 2016. Of the adolescents with alcohol intoxication, 11.4% had simultaneous drug usage. The attitude of the parents changed during the years: in 2011 (first year of registration) 68% of the parents gave permission to their child to drink alcohol, in 2016 this decreased to only 19%. Conclusions: The last decades, alcohol intoxication among youngsters has become an important aspect in Pediatrics. The Dutch Surveillance System was used to conduct a longitudinal analysis on alcohol intoxication characteristics, medical treatment and effects of interventions in this group. 1 Neonatology, University Clinic for Paediatric-and Adolescent Medicine, Austria 2 Division of Paediatric Intensive Care, University Clinic for Paediatricand Adolescent Medicine, Austria 3 Division of Paediatric Radiology, University Clinic for Radiology, Austria A 6-year old, intubated patient with intermittent CPR-necessity was admitted to the intensive care ward. He had fallen sick one week earlier with flu-like symptoms, which had progressed to head-and neck pain as well as vertigo. Furthermore he developed dyspnoea, hypersalivation, dysphagia and desaturations while failing non-invasive ventilation, leading to his intubation. Guillain-Barr\u00e9-syndrome was assumed, IVIG given and extended with 3 days Methylprednisolone. Additionally 10 cycles of plasmapheresis were performed leading to a rapid improvement of recurrent reanimation necessary bradycardic-/asystolic events. Cerebral and spinal MRI showed signal alterations/oedema of the cervical anterior horn (2 nd motor neuron) from C2 to C5 as well as signal alterations of tegmentum pontis and medulla oblongata, suspicious for rhombencephalitis and anterior myelitis (Figure 1 ). At this point, the patient showed (sub)-total paralysis with only movement of a few hand and facial muscles. PCR screening for pathogens in tracheal fluid detected enterovirus and literature associates the MRI lesions with enterovirus D-68 infection. During weaning our patient demonstrated lack of diaphragmatic movement and thus effective breathing, which led to prolonged necessity of nasotracheal intubation and later on tracheostomy with (home)-ventilation. PEG tube was installed since he was unable to swallow effectively without risk of aspiration. Extensive rehabilitative therapies were initiated, leading to significant improvement of movement but remaining home-ventilation dependent. After 3 months on intensive care, he could be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic.",

            "text": "Objectives and the Study: This was a retrospective single center study where records from malnourished pediatric cancer patients were collected and analyzed from Kocaeli University Hospital, Pediatric Oncology, Turkey. The aim was to assess the impact of oral nutritional supplementation on body mass index (BMI) in malnourished children treated for cancer. Methods: Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of cancer and all standard treatments completed in the department according to the standard protocol regimens for the specific indications. Patients were considered malnourished if weight for height was below -2 SD as determined from gender specific WHO growth charts. The cohorts included patients treated during 2010-2016 time period. Patients who received oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) in addition to their specific anti-cancer regimen were recorded for their nutritional status based on weight, height and BMI during their follow up visits. Records were obtained for a period of 8 months from the start of the treatment. Results: A total of 60 pediatric cancer patients with malnutrition (%64,6 male, %35,4 female) were included in the study. Data were analyzed either for all patients (total) or after clustering in to following tumor groups; CNS tumors 13.3 % (8 patients), lymphoma 18.3% (11 patients), other tumors 68.3% (41 patients). Comparison of pre-ONS and post-ONS anthropometric data has shown an increase in bodymass index (BMI) for the total patients group data with an increase in BMI for 36 patients (60%) versus decrease in BMI in 24 patients (40%) (p 0.05) ( Figure 1 ). Statistically significant increase was also observed for other tumors group (24 patients versus 17 patients) (p 0.001) and for lymphoma group (8 patients versus 3 patients) (p=0.012). Although not statistically significant, there was an increase in BMI for CNS tumors group as well (4 patients versus 4 patients (p=0.068). Conclusions: ONS is an important intervention in pediatric cancer patients that increases BMI and improves the nutritional status. The extent of improvement is possibly related to the disease type and location dose or two split doses. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale was used for Objective: To evaluate the opinion about vaccines of parents raising preschool children and how different sources of information shape that opinion. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted in Vilnius kindergartens in the period from December 2017 to May 2018. 329 parents of children aged from 1 to 4 participated in the survey. The respondents were compared by gender, education level and primary care provider (paediatrician vs family doctor). The data are processed by SPSS 22.0 program, the difference between the compared groups is considered significant when p\u22640.05. Results: Parents who at least once have visited homeopath value vaccines benefit 6.33 out of 10 points. However, parents who did not apply to homeopaths tend to evaluate the benefits of the vaccine more favorably (8.25 out of 10 points, p\u22640.05). Majority of respondents have received negative information about vaccination. 229 parents at least once have found negative information on the internet, but tend to rate benefits of vaccines quite well: 8.24 out of 10 points. Furthermore, 17.3 perc. respondents, who at least once received negative information about vaccination from health care specialists, tend to evaluate vaccinations worse: 6.40 out of 10 points. More than 20 perc. of parents are reported at least one episode of negative information about vaccines received during visite of health care specialist. Conclusions: The greatest impact on parents`vaccines related negativism is done by healthcare specialists, but not internet or other mass media. Future research is needed due to necessity of deeper analysis of primary sources and ways of spreading of vaccines related information in the families of preschool children.",

Several viruses can be implicated, including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). Fever, headache, and meningeal irritation signs are the most common initial findings followed by seizures, focal neurological deficits and altered consciousness. Diagnosis is clinical and radiologic, being Magnetic Ressonance Imaging (MRI) the most important imaging exam. With appropriate treatment, prognosis is generally good. Objective: To alert to less common etiologies and manifestations of ADEM Methods: Report a clinical case of a child admitted to a suburban hospital in Portugal. Clinical Report: 4-year old boy, admitted in the Pediatric Emergency Room (ER) with depression of consciousness and conjugate eye deviation to the right. In the previous 10 days, the family reported headache, frequent vomiting and fluctuant prostration, without fever. He also had recent history of chickenpox (20 days before admission). Blood analysis were unrevealing. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed pleocitosis (54 cells/mm3) with slight predominance of polymorphonuclear cells. He was hospitalized for investigation and started intravenous acyclovir. Cranioencephalic (CE) Computerized Tomography (CT) showed no alterations. Electroencephalogram documented diffuse slow-wave activity and CE-MRI revealed thalamic and subcortical lesions suggestive of ADEM. CSF microbiological culture was negative and multiplex Polimerase Chain Reaction for neurotropic virus was positive for EBV. Acyclovir was suspended at the 8 th day of hospitalization. He remained asymptomatic since the 6 th day after admission and was discharged after stopping acyclovir. He was posteriorly readmitted for immunoglobulin administration. Conclusion: ADEM can be difficult to diagnose. Frequently, the etiologic agent remains unknown. In this case, EBV might be considered as an opportunistic agent in the setting of a transient immunosuppression state. We also highlight EBV as an important causative agent of ADEM.",

Objective: Evaluate the approach, clinical evolution, complications and follow-up of newborns from MG. Methods: Retrospective analysis of newborns admitted to the Perinatology Sector (PS) and Neonatal Unit (NU), resulted from MG, between January 2016 and December 2017. Results: Ninety-eight gestations were identified, 3 triple, and 95 twin. 70.5% were bicorionic/biamniotic. 71% of the pregnancies were older than 31 years and 41% had medically assisted production techniques (APT). Of the 197 newborns, 52% were female, 73.5% premature (2.7% extreme preterm), and the mean birth weight (BW) was 2062g. 4.5% presented extreme low birth weight (ELBW). 58.4% were admitted directly in NU, 41.6% in PS. Mean gestational age (GA) of PS group was 36.8 weeks, and BW mean 2569.7g. 52.9% had hospitalization longer than protocolated. Median length hospitalization`s in NU was 19 days, with 77.2% requiring intensive care. Mortality rate was 2.5%, with 80% being extreme premature. 83.7% had a follow-up visit, with a poor staturo-ponderal evolution in 2% and inadequate psychomotor development in 6%. Extreme prematurity was associated with mortality (p0.001), and intraperiventricular hemorrhage (IPVH) (p0.001). Need for surfactant and mechanical ventilation were correlated with low birth weight (p0.001,p=0.002), very low birth weight (VLW) (p0.001,p=0.027) and ELBW (p0.001,p0.001). Need for intensive care was associated with ELBW (p=0.006) and VLW (p0.001). Inadequate psychomotor development was associated with VLW (p=0.036), and inadequate staturo-ponderal development with intrauterine growth restriction (p=0.001). Conclusion: As described in the literature, maternal age was high and there was a high percentage of APT use. In addition to complications inherent to prematurity, we found an extension of PS hospitalization time. BW and GA are important risk factors for neonatal IPVH, respiratory morbidity, inadequate psychomotor development and mortality. Background: Intrauterine exposure and its relation to the offspring metabolic and growth outcome is not clear . Adipokines; leptin and adiponectin are correlated with adult and childhood obesity, yet early gestational exposure and its relation with offspring growth needs to be determined. Objectives: To assess the relation between serum maternal and umbilical cord blood level of adipokines with the newborn weight. Subjects and Methods: 50 pairs of mother and their newborns (N:100) were enrolled in the study. Serum maternal and umbilical cord adipokines ( leptin and adiponectin) level were determined. Maternal and their newborn anthropometric measurement were obtained by trained examiners. Results: Lower serum maternal and cord blood level of leptin are associated with higher newborn weight compared to appropriate for gestational weight ( p0.05). Moreover increased newborn weight was associated with higher level of cord blood adiponectin (p0.05). cord blood of leptin was significant increased in newborns whose mother were obese when compared to normal weight mothers (p0.05). Conclusions: Maternal adipokines level affects the newborn weight",

Removing neonate from CPAP may lead to increased O 2 requirement, increased work of breathing, need to restart CPAP. Hence safe weaning methods are required to prevent neonatal mortality and morbidity. Objective: To compare gradual versus sudden weaning of preterm neonates from nasal CPAP. Methods: Preterm neonates (37weeks, 2.5kg) on CPAP were included; those with major malformations & air leaks were excluded. Neonates ready to be weaned were randomized. If the neonate was in 'sudden' weaning group, the baby was directly kept off CPAP for next 72 hours. If the neonate was in 'gradual' weaning group, the neonate was kept off CPAP for predetermined hours each day. All babies were closely monitored. If the neonates developed distress while weaning, they were put back on CPAP. Results: Out of 91 neonates, 46 (50.5%) were weaned by sudden weaning, while 45 babies (49.5%) were weaned gradually. Among the 77 babies (84.6%) who succeeded weaning, 44 (48.3%) were from the gradual weaning group as compared to 33 (36.2%) in the sudden weaning group. The chi-square statistic was 11.8476 (p 0.05). Failure rate was more (14.2%) in the sudden weaning group (p 0.05). Success rate was more (58.2%) in babies with birth weight 1.5-2.5kgs and gestational age of 32-37 weeks (58.2%) (p value 0.01). Conclusions: Gradual weaning was found to be better than sudden weaning. Success was more in babies 1.5 Background: Primary Hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disease, with an estimated incidence of 1:100 000 live births per year in Europe. It is caused by mutations in AGXT gene, leading to liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) dysfunction. Its heterogeneous presentation proves a diagnostic challenge and a high level of suspicion is necessary for an early diagnosis. Over 50% already present with end stage renal disease (ESRD) at time of diagnosis. Case report: We report the case of a 14-year-old boy, second child to consanguineous parents, followed in Pediatric Nephrology consultation of a tertiary hospital. No relevant past history, except for enuresis and minor beta-talassemia. He was first referred at the age of 9 for recurrent lithiasis (episodes of stone elimination) and ureteral dilatation. At presentation, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 32.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 and ultrassonography (US) confirmed bilateral renal lithiasis causing right ureter obstruction and nonspecific parenchymal hyperechogenicity. Stone analysis revealed calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals and 24-h urine had markedly elevated urine oxalate excretion (2.22 mmol/1.73m 2 /day). Besides hydration, he was treated with sodium and potassium citrate and pyridoxine, and eGFR transiently improved (93.7 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). However, despite increasing doses, urine oxalate excretion remained more than 3-fold higher than reference values. Genetic tests confirmed a mutation in AGXT gene, c.1151TC, in homozygosity. Approximately two years after initial symptoms, nephrocalcinosis was identified in US, consistent with the diagnosis, and eGFR gradually declined while albuminuria and uricemia got elevated. Oxalate deposition in myocardium, retina, bone marrow and thyroid was excluded following a multidisciplinary approach. At 14 years old, eGFR went bellow 40 mL/min/1.73m 2 and he was then proposed for a sequential liver-kidney transplantation. Liver transplantation of deceased donor was performed with no major complications. Conclusions: Recurrent urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis in children along with suggestive family history/consanguinity should raise the suspicion of PH1. Definite diagnosis is based on mutation analysis. Conservative treatment may increase renal survival, therefore it should be started when the disease is first suspected. Sequential or combined liver and kidney transplantation should be planned when eGFR declines below 40mL/min/1.73m 2 to avoid systemic complications of systemic oxalosis.",

Deficits in the control of coordinated movement of limb, speech and voice production often present in those children diagnosed within the spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. The measurement of speech and voice production allows for a sensitive and quantitative description of coordinated movement. Vocal fold vibration and movement of the articulators may be quantitatively assessed with acoustical measures of fundamental frequency (F0) and formant frequencies (F1 and F2) as well as syllable duration. When embedded within a stimuli designed to elicit prosodic contrasts (Casper, et al., 2006) these measures provide an objective index for monitoring speech motor control. Objective: Normal child development is marked by intelligible speech, gradual increase in length and complexity of utterances and flexible prosody. Both standard assessment and acoustic analyses of speech are reviewed as measures for evaluating neurological status. Method: Differential diagnosis and treatment protocols directed at improving speech motor control were used to assess and monitor neurological status in pre-school children aged 3-5 years. Case studies presented evaluate verbal apraxia, sensory processing and delayed language development.",

Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disabilities characterized by impairments in social communication, restricted areas of interest, and repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Symptoms typically are apparent by the age of 3 years. Objective: To determine the prevalence of ASD among children of the largest of 4 health maintenance organizations in Israel. Methods: Point prevalence and diagnostic trends of ASD over the past 18 years were examined over a wide geographical area of central Israel, encompassing a database of 331,169 children, age 3-18 years. Special importance was attached to statistics from different religious and ethnocultural groups as potentially reflecting discrepancies in diagnosis, reporting, and possibly environmentally-related trigger factors in the causality of an essentially genetically determined syndrome. Results: Overall prevalence was 0.004 (1/250 live births), well below firgures from other similar studies abroad and in Israel. Prevalence figures for the ultra-orthodox Jewish community were the lowest (0.0022), when compared with the general population and Israeli Arabs (0.0033). Time trends indicated a surge of ASD among Israeli Arabs and Ethiopian Jews between the years 2004 and 2015, in contrast with a general flattening for the ultra-orthodox community (p0.01). Conclusions: Results indicated that besides discrepancies in diagnosis and reporting factors, there exists a possible relation between clinical expression of an ASD genetic predisposition and the socioeconomic/ cultural environmental factors at work in impacting on the epigenetics in the causality of autism. Our prevalence rates are currently lower than those for ASD in Europe and the USA. The results should be of special interest to planners of health and educational services for the handicapped in countries with minorities or immigrant groups in social transition. Background: Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to treat 5q-Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), is currently available in Portugal for SMA patients. In clinical trials, SMA type 1 patients achieved a substantial motor milestone response. Objective: To report the clinical results of nusinersen in a single tertiary centre, in Portugal. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of type 1 SMA patients treated with nusinersen. Demographic, clinical (including motor scores -CHOP-INTEND), ventilation and feeding parameters were obtained from clinical records. Results: We are currently treating 5 genetically confirmed SMA type 1 patientscurrent mean age 16,4 months (range 8-25 months), four with 2 copies of SMN2 and one with 3 copies of SMN2. The mean time from the first symptoms to the diagnosis confirmation was 3,1 months (range 0,3-10,0) and from the diagnosis confirmation to the beginning of treatment was 1,1 months (range 0,5-1,7). Only 3 patients had \u2265 6 months of treatment (5, 6 and 9 administrations of nusinersen respectively), and they all improved at least 4 points in CHOP-INTEND score (mean change 10.0 points). The eldest patient (25 months-old) began treatment at 2,3 months and has achieved independent sitting. Prior to treatment, 2 patients required continued non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and one 14 hours per day. After 6 months of treatment they all reduced time of NIV up to 8 hours per day. Gastrostomy was performed in 2 patients during treatment and one required tube feeding. No side effects of treatment were noticed. Conclusion: We observed an improvement in motor function and ventilatory support in SMA type 1 patients with \u2265 6 months of treatment with nusinersen. Despite our small sample, our findings are promising and contribute to the increasing evidence that early diagnosis and treatment is paramount for these patients. Background: Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a clinical diagnosis given to children who have a dramaticalmost overnightonset of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Recent findings suggest a relationship between a post-infectious response and behavioral changes, which may be a form of post-infectious autoimmunity, through molecular mimicry, resulting in various neurological symptoms. We've coined the term \"Alzheimer's of the Immune System,\" or AIS, to identify this syndrome. As a result of our studies and observations, we've identified a number of common immune defects in patients with this presentation which suggests a new immune deficiency. Given our findings, we hypothesize that AIS is the underlying mechanism that leads to PANS. Methods: Based on this hypothesis, we proposed a study to explore the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)[Octagam 5%] for the treatment of PANS. The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of IVIG in PANS over a period of 6 months (6 infusions) based on psychological evaluation scores using 6 different assessments ( Figure 1 ). Secondary objectives included evaluation of the immunomodulatory effect of IVIG on key biomarkers associated with PANS.",

Introduction: Neuroprotective benefit of therapeutic hypothermia in term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was analyzed by survival and neuro-developmental outcome of neonates subjected to this procedure. Material and Methods: Newborns with gestational age 36 weeks and 6 hours of age with moderate to severe asphyxial encephalopathy underwent cooling protocol at a temperature of 33.5\u00b0C for 72 hours and rewarming period of 6 hours. Outcome measures assessed were death and neurodevelopmental characteristics, which were compared at the different age using ASQ3. Results: 42 children were assessed at age 6-8months, 42 children at 12-14months. Median gestational age was 38 weeks, birth weight 2.8kg, Apgar score 2/4 and pH on admission to the hospital 7.02. Four (8%) children died. At the first assessment developmental categories of communication were normal in 61.9%, problem solving in 69.1%, personal-social in 61.9%, gross motor in 66.27%, and fine motor in 40.5% with a high need of retesting in this area. Second assessment was done in 42 patients: developmental categories of communication normal in 78.6%, problem solving in 76.2%, personal-social in 71.4%, gross motor in 81.0%, and fine motor in 50%. Conclusion: There was no correlation between baseline parameters and outcome. Results of the study are showing that therapeutic hypothermia in term newborns can provide better survival and less neurologic sequels in HIE patients.

Ultrasound with Doppler allowed us to establish an individual duration of treatment with propranolol and to minimize the percentage of rebound syndrome against the background of discontinuation of therapy with propranolol. Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder in newborn. The incidence is 1%. There is good evidence that left ventricular outflow tract obstructions have 'high heritability', however there is no consensus guidelines on screening babies with positive family history. Often the family history is vague and unclear. Aim: To review the family history, and detection rate of CHD, for the babies with family history of CHD. Method: Retrospective review of two-year data on all babies who were referred to clinic with family history of CHD. The data collected include: gender, pre-and post-ductal saturations, the types of family history, family affected by CHD, investigations performed and the findings on referred babies. Results: Out of 665 of new patients seen in cardiac clinic between January 2017 to December 2018, 75 (11%) babies were referred for family history of CHD. Only 69% of these babies have pre-and post-ductal saturations done, and all of them were normal. Heart murmur presented in 20 babies (27%). The most common family history is 'hole in the heart', and unspecified CHD. And eight families only declared history of heart murmur. The CHD was most commonly presented in siblings (29%), followed by mother (20%) and father (20%). 9 out of 75 (12%) of these babies were found to have abnormal findings on echocardiogram. This is a 10-fold increased in risk if compared to general population. Most common CHD detected is ASD. Out of them, two babies (22%) have heart murmur on clinical examination. Conclusion: Obtaining accurate cardiac family history during newborn check can be challenging and baby who has CHD is often asymptomatic. Screening of babies with family history of CHD is justified, but may need to be more targeted, in light of new studies on inheritability of CHD. ",

Methods: Based on the relevant literature, we developed a questionnaire to assess vaccines`safety and efficacy perception, perception of severity of vaccine-prevented diseases, conspiracy theory ideas, beliefs about immunizations requirements, social norms and relationship with health professionals. This questionnaire was disseminated online using the snowball method and several parenting social media groups. Parents of children 0-12 years old were invited to participate. Results: The questionnaire showed good validity and reliability. A sample of 1118 parents aged 18 to 58 years old filled the questionnaire, and only 3.1% reported vaccine hesitancy regarding an eventual future child. All the evaluated dimensions showed discriminant power. A binary logistic regression was performed to test for discriminative power and predict vaccine hesitation. Perception of vaccine`s safety and efficacy, and positive attitudes towards vaccination requirements predicted the intention to adhere to the recommended immunization plan in the event of having another child. Conclusions: The large majority of Portuguese parents of young children hold vaccine-favorable beliefs and attitudes. All dimensions evaluated were significantly different for parents who would not vaccinate a new child compared to those who would. Beliefs regarding vaccine`s safety and efficacy and acceptance of school or health services requirements were the most relevant dimensions for this choice. There is a need to measure and improve the quality of paediatric primary care in Europe where major differences in the delivery and outcomes of child health care exist. A collaborative panel of paediatric senior experts developed a Core Set of Indicators for Paediatric Primary Care in Europe by compiling 42 quality indicators in a modified consensus process following the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of the quality indicator set in European paediatric primary care practices. Seventy-nine practices from eight countries participated in a detailed online interview. The practices rated the applicability, relevance, reliability and acceptance of the 42 quality indicator as well as the availability, technical feasibility and effort to retrieve the needed data from their medical records. Most quality indicators were considered applicable, available, reliable, acceptable and relevant for monitoring quality of care in paediatric primary care. Respondents rated feasibility and effort to retrieve the data lowest because of difficulties collecting the data from the medical records. Conclusion: European paediatric primary care practices generally agree with the proposed quality indicator set. They document most of the parameters. However, the collection of specific needed values from available routine patient-data is considered technically difficult and time-consuming.",

Most prominent are deviations from weight followed by deviations in head circumference trajectories, and delay in motor development due to muscle strength and tone irregularities. Identification of risk factors at infancy is crucial for early intervention programs, such as prevention of rapid changes in weight and manipulations to strengthen motor development and the corresponding neural circuits. The sooner risk factors are recognized, more efficient an early tailored bio-psycho-social treatment might be. Background: There are growing concerns in the U.S. about the increasing prevalence of paediatric neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders, now 15% and 11-20% respectively. There is a critical shortage of board certified neurodevelopmental, developmental/behavioral or child psychiatry subspecialists to care for this vulnerable population. Per the American Board of Pediatrics' estimates, there is one board certified subspecialist for every 100,000 U.S. children.

Thanks to mounting research work hypnotherapy is now succesful evidence-based method of treatment in many pediatric conditions. Primary care pediatrician interested in the field can achieve proper education on hypnotherapy. In primary care pediatric practice there are many children that can profit if the help is offered on spot and in much less time than referral to the specialist. Objective: In three years after finishing the national training program on hypnotherapy more than 150 children were offered help with hypnotherapy in my primary care pediatric office.",

Pediatrics, Montefiore Medical Center, USA Background: Asthma severity or level of control classification is the first step in asthma management. To optimize asthma management, screening must be done at each visit. Objectives: 1) To develop and implement asthma severity and control screening within electronic health record (EHR) of a large urban health system; 2) To increase asthma screening from 0% to 80% by December 2020. Methods: We developed an asthma screening algorithm in EHR based on national guidelines. Screening is conducted by the nursing staff prior to patient being seen by the provider. Based on responses, severity/control classification is calculated and displayed in EHR. Classic Quality Improvement tools such as the Model for Improvement and Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles were used to incorporate changes into daily workflow. Practice Advisory Board meets monthly to discuss barriers to implementation and identify solutions. The Board makes decisions on adopting successful strategies and brainstorm new strategies to address barriers.",

Results: Seventy (46 female) patients with monogenic AIDs were analyzed. Consanguinity rate was 74.6% and a family history of AIDs was present in 60%. The mean age at disease onset was 3.2\u00b12 years. The initial diagnosis was inaccurate in 47% and the mean diagnosis delay was 4\u00b13 years. The most frequent monogenic AIDs were LACC1 associated monogenic JIA and monogenic Crohn's (23) followed by CAPS (12), TRAPS (12), HIDS (9), Majeed's syndrome (6). Musculoskeletal involvement was the main feature in LACC1 associated monogenic disorders. Genetic testing was performed in 67 patients, 69% had genetically confirmed disease. Patients with mutation c.T850C p.C284R in exon 4 of LACC1 had severe arthritic changes. Three CAPS patients with NLRP3 mutation had cognitive impairment and one with significant hearing and ocular damage. Two HIDS patients had homozygous p.V3771 mutation and other two patients with p.V3771/compound heterozygous MEFV: p.E148Q/p.P369S/ p.R408G. Three different LPIN2 mutations were recorded for Majeed's syndrome. Overall, growth failure was the most frequent (36%), followed by cognitive impairment (13%). There were three deaths due to infection. Conclusion: The number of genetically confirmed patients with monogenic AIDs other than FMF are not uncommon among Arab children probably due to a high consanguinity rate. Diagnostic delay and high damage accrual emphasize the need for more awareness and early referral to specialized centers. ",

She had no previous medical records, neither had she reached menarche. She presented on Pediatric Emergency Department with severe suprapubic abdominal pain and anorexia for the last 4 days. As she would add later, she had been suffering from suprapubic pain, diarrhea and vomiting once in a month, for the last 6 months. Physical exploration: abdominal guarding, intense hypogastrium pain, normal female genitalia, low-grade fever. Analytical: leukocytosis, increased CRP. On suspicion of acute abdomen, an urgent abdominal ultrasound was made, showing fluid collection in uterine cavity that extended to peritoneal cavity through Fallopian tubes. Gynecologists, under general anaesthesia, performed ultrasound-guided introduction of a grooved probe, through a completely stenotic cervical OS into the uterine cavity, in order to drain the uterus (picture 1). Later, a pediatric surgeon performed a laparotomy, profuse lavage and evacuation of purulent fluid from peritoneum (picture 2). Reproductive organs were preserved, and a Foley baloon catheter was left inside the uterus for 2 weeks. No incidents were recorded during postoperative evolution, so she was discharged. One month later, she was asymptomatic and did not reach menarche yet. Conclusions: Peritonitis is not always appendicular.

Seven had a history of institutionalization, and other 16 cases were under social services following. Conclusion: Immaturity, misjudgment, impulsivity and lack of coping strategies are related to self-harm behavior, including IDI, in adolescents. Most times, there is no apparent structured suicidal intent. Emotional conflicts, social problems and a personal and family history of psychopathology are risk factors for this behavior.

Background: Being concerned about internet addiction, American researchers have included this condition in compulsive-impulsive disorders. In some countries, officials have set up treatment centers or organized educational programs in schools to stop the spread of the epidemic. In 2016, the World Health Organization included game addiction in the International Diseases Index (ICD11), including in this category also computer game or online addiction. In Romania, we have no real data on the extent of this phenomenon or the need to implement educational programs in schools. Aims and Objectives: Identify and quantify the forms of internet addiction among secondary school, high school and university students. Material and Methods: We conducted a qualitative observational survey on a total of 404 subjects, who completed a standardized questionnaire that quantifies internet dependency and classifies it in three mild, moderate, severe forms. Results and Discussions: 77.6% of the subjects are internet-dependent to a certain extent (64.7% mild dependence, 12.5% medium and 0.4% severe). We noticed that the proportion of those who have the medium form of internet addiction is increasing as they get older.

Background: Adolescence is a period of important physical, psychological and emotional development. The need to become independent and to experience new sensations is associated with risk behaviors, such as use and abuse of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs. Objective and Methods: To evaluate new trends of substance use in teenagers, by searching medical databases and journals for published articles in the last 5 years, using the keywords \"substance\", \"use\", \"adolescents\" Results: The most common substances used by adolescents are alcohol and tobacco, as they are more readily available. Although a decline of cigarette smoking in adolescents has been observed in the last decades, ecigarettes are recently gaining popularity and their use has been associated with initiation and then transition to more frequent cigarette smoking.",

Marijuana is increasingly displacing alcohol and cigarettes as the first substance used, and is causally associated with subsequent polysubstance use. Since the mid 2000s New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) have been available on the market, specifically designed to imitate the effects of established illicit drugs, and untruly known as legal. Their use among adolescents is still low, but increasing, as they reported being more likely to try drugs if they are legal. Conclusion: Adolescent substance use has been declining worldwide. This decreasing trend is probably a result of intensively provided preventive and educational measures, increasing the public awareness of the severity of underage substance use. Of major concern, the more prominent role of marijuana in the early stages of drug use and the rise of NPS, given the considerable potential for harm, including hospitalizations, overdose and fatalities.",

Endocrine screening after trauma is controversial. Objective: We highlight the steps leading to diagnosis in the case of an adolescent hospitalised for unrelated pathology in order to increase awareness on this rare condition among physicians. Methods and results: We report the case a 17-year-old boy admitted in March 2019 in \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Hospital, Bucharest. The adolescent had a history of severe brain injury (age 13) due to a car accident. He was hospitalized 4 years later in the Orthopaedics Department for surgical correction of right hip chronic epiphysiolysis. The laboratory tests showed liver cytolysis, so he was transferred to the Paediatrics Department. The physical examination revealed coarse features, dry, harsh skin, coarse hair, the absence of face and body pilosity, absent secondary sex characteristics, infantile genitalia, hypopigmented skin lesions, inferior limb inequality with no other pathologic findings. Laboratory investigations showed decreasing transaminases, positive serology for EBV, low values of thyroid hormones, inadequate TSH, hypocortisolaemia, low testosterone and IGF 1. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed post-traumatic right eye cecity. The endocrinology consult set the diagnosis of panhypopituitarism. Substitution treatment was recommended (Prednisone, L-Thyroxine, Testosterone). The cranio-cerebral MRI showed small pituitary gland, right deviated pituitary stalk, unidentifiable neurohypophysis and right optic nerve, parasphenoidal herniation of the arachnoid.",

Overweight and obesity were highly prevalent (25%), as of sedentarism, with only 13% exercising daily. 78% lived with both parents and 59% had medium-low affluent families. We identified four distinct behavioural clusters: \"Active screen users\" (31,1%), \"Substance users\" (13,3%), \"Healthy\" (26,4%) and \"Sedentary low fruit and vegetable eaters\" (29,1%). Sociodemographics varied across clusters, showing a positive and significant association between male gender, poor family communication, violent behaviours, poor academic performance and school attachment and the \"Substance users\" and \"Active screen users\" clusters and between a low socioeconomic status and the \"Sendentary low fruit and vegetable eaters\" cluster. We found no association between nutritional status and cluster membership. Conclusion: Cluster analysis identified several health compromising behaviour patterns. The understanding of these behavioural clusters and its relationship with individual and context factors is of extreme use to Public Health, allowing tailored health-promoting interventions. Further research is needed to understand how cluster membership evolves over time and its influence on nutritional status. Results: In the analyzed period, there were registered 38363 emergency adolescents episodes. 67% of the admitions were due to \"DISEASE\", 24,1% due to \"ACCIDENTS\" (road, sports, personal, work, domestic and school accidents), 0,7% were \"INTOXICATIONS\", 0,5% for \"ASSAULT\" episodes and 0,7% admissions of \"PREGNANT AND PARTURIENT\". One third of the \"DISEASE\" admissions were due to respiratory disease and one sixth due to digestive disease. Mental health and behavioral issues were responsible for 4% oh these diagnostics. 58,3% of the adolescents was observed only by Pediatrics specialists, and the others needed collaboration from other specialties. Conclusion: 26% of the admissions were due to preventable causes, like accidents, intoxications, agressions or pregnancy. It's urgent to act at primary prevention level, but it's also important to take every contact chances to identify those at risk and decrease this group morbidity.",

Healthcare professionals typically have not received proper training on the subject at hand. This results in mistakes in patient care that could be avoided. Clinical case: We herein describe a study case of a 15-year-old male patient who is brought by his mother to our PED, referred from a tertiary-level Hospital after having conducted higher risk intercourse with an adult male. The youngster had arranged a meeting using a mobile phone application. At the first PED he visited, no clinical samples were collected, although medical examination was executed. Instead, the patient was directly referred to the National Police, who took judicial samples with the collaboration of a forensic doctor.At our PED, which he was later referred to, the patient and his mother handed the medical report from the first PED, so no new interrogations or physical examinations were carried out. Following our Hospital's Child Molestation Protocol a blood and urine sample was tested for sexually transmitted diseases and a negative urine toxicity study was carried out. After evaluating the results, the patient began taking the post-exposure prophylaxis and antibiotic prophylaxis medicines. Finally, he was given an appointment with the Pediatric Infectology Consultation so that a proper follow-up could be carried out. Conclusion: Child abuse is a frequent reason of consultation in PPC services, for which Healthcare professionals (HP) are not completely prepared to assist. Usually, they have not received proper training to do so, and they are not aware of the procedure to be followed in terms of observation, notification and management. Accordingly, a standardized Health Care Protocol should be developed and introduced. HP should receive specific and proper training to successfully address this issue and provide the best patient care possible. The need for the abovementioned is particularly strong, considering the increasing amount of cases taking place,and the new ones arising from the use of the New Technologies. Objective of this study was to improve the primary immunodeficiency diagnostics through implementation of the model combining physician education and public awareness with the infrastructure to diagnose these diseases. Methods: Three strategies combination has been followed from February 2017 in Ternopil region, Ukraine. The first was education of primary-care physicians (pediatricians, GP doctors) and other specialists (rheumatologists, otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, etc.) in early PID symptoms and detection using workshops, trainings, and targeted publications. The second was organization of public events, media appearance to raise PID awareness. The third was undertaken immunological testing for patients with suspected PID. Results: Workshops and trainings for primary care physicians on early PID detection were organized in 2017 in every regional district (15 districts were totally covered). Generally 540 physicians and nurses attended the lectures and workshops, including pediatricians, general practitioners, etc. We also visited the outpatient departments, talking to doctors, patients and their parents about the PID warning signs.",

By the beginning of 2017, there were 11 children with PID in our region, at the end of 2018 their number increased to 31. We also follow 12 patients with suspected PID that need monitoring and examinations to finalize the diagnosis. Conclusion: Implementation of the model combining physician education and public awareness with the infrastructure to diagnose these diseases is effective strategy to increase PID diagnosis. Background: Violation of vegetative regulation (VR) is a component of the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma (BA). Purpose: Determine the relationship of VR parameters with the parameters of asthma control level in children using methods available in a wide clinical practice. Method: 88 patients (54 boys and 34 girls) aged 5 to 17 years with atopic bronchial asthma were examined. Quantitative assessment of bronchial asthma control was carried out using questionnaires Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5), Childhood Asthma control test (ACT-C) in children under 12 years old, and Asthma control test (ACT) in children and adolescents aged 12 years and older. All children underwent a standard examination with determination of blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, with the calculation of Kerdo and Hildebrandt indices, characterizing vegetative regulation. Taking into account the age-dependent changes in heart rate, we used for the first time a relative heart rate index equal to the ratio of the patient`s heart rate to the median heart rate for this age group.",

Conclusion: The delay in weight and growth is one of ten alarming primary immunodeficiencies proposed by a number of primary immunodeficiency foundations in the world. This indicator, together with microcephaly, is a clinical criterion for the Nijmegen Syndrome and can help to diagnose the problem in the early period.

            "text": "Allergy & Immunology Background: Following the revolutionary results from the LEAP (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy) study advising the early introduction of peanuts to children at high risk of this allergy, clinicians and allergists have been trying to implement this safely into clinical practice, with the ultimate goal of reversing the trend of rising peanut allergy within the population. However, despite good intentions and well-thought through methods, this does not always go to plan. Method: We discuss a 13-month old girl with severe eczema who has a negative skin prick test, IgE and component blood tests to peanut, and is suitably advised to perform an oral peanut challenge at home. Unfortunately, Mum subsequently reports symptoms of widespread urticaria and watery eyes on ingestion of a small amount of peanut butter. Despite the likelihood that this is an allergic reaction to peanut, because of the discrepancy between her tests and her home challenge, parents request to proceed with an hospital-based oral food challenge. Conclusion: Applying evidenced-based knowledge within clinical practice may not be as straightforward as clinicians would envisage. In order to work together and made a significant reduction in prevalence of peanut allergy particularly in the UK, clearer national guidelines or recommendations need to be developed to guide clinicians towards the safe introduction of peanuts in children with high risk of developing this allergy. Background: A skin prick test is the most widely used test to diagnose allergic diseases. However, it is not known much about the effect of the body mass index on skin reactivity. Therefore, we aim to investigate the changes in skin reactivity to histamine and allergens according to the changes in body mass index (BMI) in Korean children. Methods: The data of 230 children were used in this analysis. And, the data were collected in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Skin prick test was performed for 26 aeroallergens and other variables were obtained, including sex, age, BMI, parental allergy history, and parental smoking. Multivariate analysis was used to confirm the association between the changes in skin reactivity and body mass index. Results: Mean size of skin wheal induced histamine and BMI were increased for two years. Changes in skin wheal induced by histamine showed significant correlation with changes in BMI (Spearman's Rho=0.209, P-value 0.001). However, changes in the size of the skin response to Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) did not correlate with changes in BMI. Conclusion: The magnitude of skin response to histamine was correlated with an increase in body mass index. However, the wheal size for Df and Dp was not related to the change in the BMI. The effects of BMI on the interpretation of skin prick test should be considered. Introduction: Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS)/DIHS is a complex syndrome characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical features, like fever, lymphadenopathy, cutaneous manifestations and visceral involvement, eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis. Beta-lactams, anticonvulsants, allopurinol, sulfonamides are culprit drugs than can trigger this delayed hypersensitivity mechanism. Herpes virusdrug interactions are sometimes observed. A 12-month-old female baby, with congenital heart disease and chromosomal abnormality (deletion of short arm of chromosome 8) was submitted to undergo cardiac surgery. On day 6 post-surgery she was prescribed with intravenous vancomycin and gentamycin, for infection. Due to loss of intravenous line, on day 7 post-surgery, a switch to oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was done. On day 8 of antibiotic, she presented an urticarial maculopapular rash with facial edema and fever, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy, associated with laboratorial abnormalities 10% atypical lymphocytes, and elevated AST 429 U/L and ALT 621U/L, suggestive of a mononucleosic syndrome. On day 11 of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, this antibiotic was suspended. Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis were IgG positive. Parainfluenza virus type 3 was also positive. HHV 6 and 7 serologies and measles virus RNA were negative. On day 18 of admission, the child was seriously ill and vancomycin and ceftriaxone were again started. On day 29 post-surgery, endocarditis was confirmed by cardiac ultrasound, and daptomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin was started with clinical improvement. The baby was discharged on day 48 post-surgery, a subtle rash in her legs was still observed. Four months later, she was inadvertly prescribed amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for an upper respiratory infection. On the 3 rd day of antibiotic, she presented again with an urticarial rash that was promptly suspended. Conclusions: The diagnosis of DRESS/DIHS was proposed, based on RegiSCAR (European registry of severe cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs) criteria.",

Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are widely used to treat hypertension in adults. The use of these drugs in pediatric age is increasing due to the higher prevalence of obesity and its co-morbidities'. Objective: To alert pediatric community about angioedema as ACEI side effect. Methods: Report of clinical case from a suburban hospital in Portugal. Clinical Report: Fifteen year-old african descendent female with morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 followed in cardiovascular risk outpatient clinic. Treated with lisinopril since December 2017. During hospital admission in January 2019, she developed labial and tongue edema followed by asymmetric periorbital involvement, without itching nor urticaria, unresponsive to high dose hydroxyzine. Lisinopril was discontinued and no other therapeutic measures were taken. Clinical manifestations gradually disappeared during the following five days. The patient reported a similar episode five months before that resolved spontaneously, without therapy changes. Conclusion: In adults, angioedema is an unusual but well-recognized side effect of ACEI therapy, up to five times greater in African descents. However, in the \"pediatric world\", physicians are less familiar and therefore less alert to possible ACEI side effects. Although benign and selflimited, ACEI induced angioedema can be potentially fatal, therefore physicians should consider this possibility when evaluating patients with acute or recurrent angioedema.",

            "text": "Allergy & Immunology Background: Asthma is a global public health program. It affects patients of different age and is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases among children. Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of children with asthma by both self-and proxy-reports. Methods: A total of 527 Lithuanian children with asthma and their parents were enrolled into a cross-sectional study. Participants of the study were asked to fill in anonymous questionnaires during scheduled outpatient visits to pediatric pulmonologist. QoL of children with asthma was assessed using PedsQL Asthma Module consisting of 2 scales and 22 questions. Ageappropriate versions of the questionnaire were completed by children and their parents. Scores for each scale and overall score were calculated and ranged from 0 to 100 where higher score referred to better QoL. Results: The age of children enrolled into this study varied from 2 to 17 years and the mean age was 8.4 (\u00b14.3) years. A total of 63.2% of respondents were boys. Children evaluated their asthma related QoL better compared to parents' evaluation (median score 77.3 (68.2; 86.4) and 75.0 (63.6; 86.4) respectively, p=0.045). The differences between parent and children assessment were the highest at the oldest age group. The most important factors, associated with the QoL of children with asthma by both self-and proxy-reports were asthma severity and control as well as shortness of breath. Parent reported QoL was also related with child's general health and presence of concomitant allergies. Conclusions: Children with asthma assess their QoL better compared to their parents. The differences in the assessment were the highest at the oldest age group of children and should be taken into consideration during the preparation of individual asthma control plan. Background: Deceleration trauma resulting in thoracic aortic contained rupture is uncommon and associated with a high prehospital mortality. Less than 25% of patients with blunt thoracic aortic injury survive long enough to reach a hospital. Radiological plays an important role in diagnosis and accurate classification of the type of dissection, in order to plan the intervention and optimize the outcome. Objective: The authors aim to report a rare case of blunt thoracic aortic injury successfully corrected and share the correspondent unique imaging. Case Report: A 17-year-old high energy accident victim with several traumatic lesions arrived in the emergency room. He was hemodynamically stable and had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. He presented diminished breath sounds on the left hemithorax and gross hematuria. Chest radiograph revealed left hemidiaphragmatic rupture with stomach herniation and mediastinal enlargement. A thoracic CT scan confirmed visceral herniation through the ruptured diaphragm, fracture of four left ribs and a contained aortic rupture located at the aortic isthmus, associated with perivascular hematomatype IV. Endovascular treatment was considered unsuitable due to unfavorable anatomical characteristics. Therefore, the patient was submitted to open descending aorta replacement by a vascular prothesis. Distal aortic perfusion was maintained by a Gott shunt. Simultaneously, diaphragm laceration was directly sutured. Post-operative radiological revaluation revealed good resolution of both lesions. Due to acute renal injury caused by severe rhabdomyolysis, continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was required for 25 days. Regarding outcome, the adolescent was discharged home 44 days after hospital admission, without any severe sequelae. Conclusion: This clinical case highlights the importance of considering different types of internal hemorrhage in cases of trauma, particularly life-threatening lesions resulting from blunt trauma. In this particular case, the patient was hemodynamically stable at all times, which was only possible due to the containment of the hemorrhage to the mediastinum. Background: One of the main sources of poisoning in young children are cleaning products. Among the newest ones, we find laundry detergent capsules (LDC). Because their higher concentration of detergent serious clinical manifestation can be observed. We present a case of a 12-month-old boy who bit an LDC (Ariel 3in1), and developed metabolic acidosis, digestive and respiratory impairment. Case Presentation: A healthy 12-month-old boy, was brought to Emergency Room vomiting, coughing and dysphonia after biting an LDC. We contacted the National Institute of Toxicology of Spain who told us the main risk of this ingestion is metabolic acidosis, but not chemical mucosal burning. In the physical examination he was irritable with presence of respiratory distress and inspiratory stridor. Laboratory tests on admission revealed: Hemoglobin: 11.4g/dL, WBC 29400/\u03bcL (neutrophils 57%). The blood gases showed a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.29, HCO3: 15mmol/L, pCO2: 40mmHg, BE: -13mmol/L). Renal function was normal. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral peribronchial thickening, predominantly at the left base. He was initially treated with dexamethasone, nebulized adrenaline, salbutamol, oxygen and bicarbonate perfusion, which was maintained for 3 days. On the second day, an upper endoscopy showed caustic ulcerations in epiglottis and subglottic regions. Esophageal endoscopy did not show any damage. Hemoglobin gradually dropped to 8g/L at 3 rd day. Digestive hemorrhage was suspected and treated with omeprazole. At discharge respiratory symptoms and metabolic acidosis were solved with no digestive symptoms. Three months after an upper gastrointestinal series showed a membrane in the middle third of the esophagus. Conclusions: The main component of the Ariel 3in1 is Dodecylbenzenesulfonte which may produce gastrointestinal burning. However, combining it with other component, Propylene-gycol, the toxicity may enhance, and appear metabolic acidosis. When bitten by children can burst and spray the content in the respiratory and GI systems, causing mucosal damage leading to several complications. Background: Pediatric Emergency Departments (PED) evaluate a large number of sub-acute conditions. PED is convenient but expensive resource for sub-acute care to providers and patients alike. Pediatric Urgent Care (PUC) is rapidly reshaping the landscape in delivering subacute care for children. This report is to share our experience. Methods: Data analyzed included demographics, chief complaints (CCs), throughput, cost, satisfaction and quality. The analysis describes basic operational statistics and compared CCs and volumes during different \"seasons\". We compared PUC and PED length of visit (LOV) and cost. Patient satisfaction was measured by 5-point Likert scale. Data are presented as percentages, means or p values. Results: We analyzed 15,482 visits. Daily average volume; 18.4 patient (range 7-67). Visits increased 60% from year 1 to year 2 and a 25 % in year 3. Weekends accounted for 39% of the visits. Fall/winter season was busier and Sundays were most crowded. The first hour on Sunday mornings had the highest arrival rate. The least arrivals were in the last hour of weeknights. 51% were males. Age average was 12.9 years (SD: + 9.9). Most common CCs were respiratory infection, fever, extremity injury and sore throat; 14%, 13%, 12%, and 10% respectively. There was no significant difference between CCs during fall/winter with more infectious etiologies compared to spring/summer with more injures (P0.5). PUC LOV was 52 minutes and 117 in PED. Percent of 48-hours returns to PUC was 1.1 % (95% CI: 0.8-1.4) and percent of patients transferred to PED was 1.5% (95% CI:-1. 1-1.9 ). Adherence to clinical standard work was 97%. Satisfaction score was 83.5% using score of 5. PUC charges for similar visit level was 47-61 % lower than PED. Conclusions: PUC are efficient and economical alternative to PED. We described one institution's experience that could prove valuable benchmark to similar practices. Background: Young children are particularly susceptible to intoxications due to the natural need of environmental exploration and inability to measure risks. Despite several preventing efforts, intoxications remain a significant cause of admission to the pediatric emergency department (PED). Objectives: Characterize childhood intoxication cases in the PED and develop prevention strategies. Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical cases of children under 4 years old attending to the PED during 10 years. Results: Between 2008-2017, 383 children with unintentional intoxications attended the PED and accounted for 0,1% of all emergency visits during the study period. The median age was 2.1 years (\u00b11.0 years); 54.3% (n=208) were female. Ingestion of drugs were involved in 52.5% (n=201) and antihistamines were the most frequent drug class. Domestic products were the second intoxication agent (36%, n=138) followed by carbon monoxide (5.7%, n=22), poisons (4.4%, n=17) and illicit drugs (0.8%, n=3). Forty percent (40.7%, n=156) of the intoxications occurred in the afternoon, 68.1% (n=261) during weekdays. 99.7% (n=382) intoxications occurred at home. A total of 50.4% (n=193) of patients were admitted less than 1 hour after exposure to the toxic agent and only 15.1% were transported to the hospital through the National Emergency Service. Most children were asymptomatic (n=224). In symptomatic patients, gastrointestinal manifestations were the most frequent (58.4%, n=93). The National Poisoning and Intoxication Center was contacted in 82.2% (n=315) of the cases. Gastrointestinal decontamination was performed in 30.3%. Four children underwent hospitalization for more than 36 hours. There were no admissions to the intensive care unit or mortality. Conclusions: The number of children with unintentional intoxication did not change significantly over the last 10 years. Ingestion of drugs that belong to family members accounts for approximately half of the cases. It remains important to ensure prevention strategies in the community. Background: Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an acute respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. Malignant pertussis (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperleukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension) is a severe form of pertussis, more common in young, non-vaccinated children, and almost always a fatal disease. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as an emergency treatment for children with life-threatening pertussis. However, the success rate is low, with only 30% survival rate. Method: We report a clinical case of a newborn admitted at pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to malignant pertussis. Results: A female newborn (28-days of age) with pertussis as a result of B. pertussis infection was admitted in PICU due to hyperleukocytosis (92030/uL) and worsening respiratory distress. Exchange transfusion was performed with mild improvement. Cardiac ultrasound revealed pulmonary hypertension. By day-2 there was clinical worsening with severe ARDS. After failure of conventional ventilation and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, cannulation of internal jugular vein and common carotid artery was performed and venoarterial ECMO support was instituted. Due to anasarca, dialytic therapy was maintained between days 9 and 32. Serial transfontanelar ultrasounds were performed to access for brain complications. By day-20 ultrasound revealed brain hemorrhage and epileptic activity was noted, with abnormal eletroencephalogram. Antiepileptic therapy was started, with good response. After 41 days of ECMO support the patient was weaned off ECMO, and extubated to noninvasive ventilation 14 days later. She was discharged from PICU at day-63 in spontaneous ventilation. She was discharged home at day-105. Conclusion: In this patient with malignant pertussis, ECMO was performed for cardiopulmonary support and rescued the infant. During ECMO support, mechanical ventilation with protective settings (high positive end-expiratory pressure and low tidal volumes) provided the opportunity for lung recovery. Despite complications (minor brain hemorrhage) the patient recovery with minor sequelae poses a good prognosis. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of pediatric hand injuries presenting to the emergency department (ED) in Korea and to assess the risk factors associated with severe hand injuries requiring hospitalization or surgery. Methods: A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted using the emergency department (ED)-based Injury In-depth Surveillance (EDIIS) registry in Korea between 2011 and 2016. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to obtain the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the factors associated with severe pediatric hand injuries. Results: Among 1,537,617 injured patients, 40,672 (26.5 per 1,000 injured patients) presented to the ED for hand injuries. The prevalence of pediatric hand injuries was highest in teenager (9.9%) and increased with age. Overall and in each age group, boys were in the majority. In infant, toddler, and pre-schooler, crushing is the most common injury mechanism, while penetrating injury were most common in schooler and teenager. Door related injuries were the most common cause in infant, toddler, and preschooler. Knife related injuries were the most common cause in schooler and teenager. A total of 2,344 (5.8%) were severe injuries requiring hospitalization or surgery. Cardinal Mechtronics, USA Background: Low-income countries severely lack adequate access to devices that accurately measure vital signs which may affect mortality outcome for pediatric patients. Developing an efficient and affordable devices that can accurately determine vital signs can contribute greatly to diagnosing critical pediatric conditions, leading to faster time to appropriate treatment. A team of engineers, industrial designers, and medical professionals developed an affordable, reusable EKG monitor prototype using carbon electrodes. Objective: The objective of study is to validate the prototype's accuracy compared to a standard EKG monitor. Methods: 21 healthy subjects, ages newborn to 60 months, were recruited from Carilion Children's General Pediatrics Clinic. Prototype device and standard EKG device were simultaneously attached to subject for 1-2 minutes. Bland-Altman method was used to evaluate if agreement existed between both devices with heartbeats counted obtained per 10-second interval (hpi) as N=1. Results: Prototype was able to detect subject's heartbeat and display distinct EKG waveforms. Loss of EKG detection from prototype was observed during loss of skin contact with carbon electrodes from movement.",

Children's Intensive Care Unit, Leicester Royal Infirmary, UK Aim: Over an 8 week period, an audit was performed to analyse the blood tests performed overnight on paediatric inpatients on our unit with the aim of identifying whether more samples are taken than required and the financial impact of this. Methods: This audit assessed essential (those blood tests which the consultant of the week recommended be taken overnight) versus those actually requested by the paediatric registrar working the night shift. The consultant of the day was asked to complete a short proforma, recording which essential bloods were needed overnight. This consultant recommendation was blinded from the registrar. We then retrospectively looked through iLab to record which bloods had actually been sent overnight. Findings: Data was collected for 62 patients over 16 weekdays on CICU. In total, 165 tests were performed, with 90 of these classed as essential and 75 (45%) as non -essential tests. This resulted in avoidable expenditure of \u00a3123.74 (45 %.) Coagulation, urea and electrolytes and liver function tests were the areas of most non-essential expenditure. This is similar to results found when this audit was performed on the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Glenfield Hospital, where 115/1059 (48%) were found to be non-essential, resulting in avoidable expenditure of \u00a3647.64 (44 %.) Conclusions: This audit has now been performed at both CICU's within our trust and it demonstrates a lack of correlation between which tests are thought to be essential by the paediatric intensive care consultants and which tests are actually being performed by the paediatric registrars covering the units overnight. Therefore, children are likely to be subjected to additional blood investigations which are non-essential to their care and also has a financial impact upon the department. Further consideration of an appropriate quality improvement initiative is needed to address these discrepancies. Methods: Prospective, cross-sectional study performed in eight PICUs, with 116 patients, 5-17 years of age, without developmental delay, submitted to mechanical ventilation or not. To assess the interobserver reliability, two previously trained researchers concomitantly applied the BRpCAM-ICU and independently rated the same patient. To assess the criterion validity, a pediatric neurologist or psychiatrist, blinded to the BRpCAM-ICU assessments, evaluated the same patient within 30 minutes, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition -DSM-5, considered the reference standard. Results: 149 paired assessments were included (some patients had more than one). Delirium was diagnosed in 11 of 149 (7%) assessments, or 8 of 116 (7%) patients, using both the BRpCAM-ICU and the DSM-5. There was one false positive and one false negative diagnosis, which resulted in 90.9% sensitivity (95%CI, 58.7-99.8%) and 99.3% specificity (95%CI, 96-100%) for the BRpCAM-ICU. The interrater reliability was considered almost perfect (\u03ba = 1.0). Conclusions: The BRpCAM-ICU is a valid and reliable tool for diagnosing delirium in pediatric patients 5-17 years of age in Brazilian PICUs. The implementation of this tool may be useful to reduce underdiagnosis, ensure monitoring and earlier intervention, provide a better prognosis, and improve research on delirium in this age group in Brazil. Background: Chest pain is a common complaint in children/adolescents visiting the emergency department (ED). The existence of underlying heart disease is rarely verified. It is mostly idiopathic, and in adolescence the psychogenic etiology assumes greater expressiveness. Objective and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical processes of patients who visited the ED between December 2017 and May 2018 with chest pain. Cases of traumatic etiology were excluded. Results: A total of 175 children/adolescents (52% girls; median age 13 years) attended the ED. Five percent had cardiovascular antecedents, and 7% psychiatric. Regarding pain characteristics, the majority lasted between 1 hour and 1 day (27%), with preferential retrosternal location (18%) or in the left hemithorax (18%). Associated symptoms occurred in 69% of patients, including 5% of palpitations and 5% of paresthesias in the left upper limb. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities in 39% of patients, 25% reported chest wall tenderness and 5% had altered cardiac auscultation. Eleven percent reported at least one stressful event associated with the onset of chest pain. Fifty-seven percent had chest Xray (16% altered), 23% electrocardiogram (7% altered), 51% cardiac enzymes (2% altered) and 32% did not perform any additional investigation. Regarding the final diagnosis, 38% was idiopathic, 29% respiratory, 17% musculoskeletal, 14% psychogenic and 2% cardiac. Concerning psychogenic pain, there was a statistically significant relationship with the adolescence phase, female sex and the presence of previous stressful events (p 0.05). Two percent of the patients were admitted in the pediatric unit and 2% were transferred to a cardiovascular reference center. Conclusion: The number of children/adolescents who were admitted due to chest pain, highlights the importance of the characterization of this population. Cases of cardiac etiology are rare and it is therefore essential to give young people and families a sense of security in the absence of serious illness. Average PIM score of patients -33.5%. 79 of the xrays have been requested for urgent reasons (56%) whereas (44%) for routine actions. 47 of the urgent Xray were followed by a change in management (33.4% of total xrays and 55% of the urgent ones) Conclusions: All our CXR have been requested based on clinical reasons and more than half of them had urgent indication. More than half of the urgent Xrays were followed by a change in management (1/3 of total). Although our study is not large, we conclude that CXR should be performed based on clinical indication only. Background: The PICU at Edmond and Lily Safra Hospital moved to its new 22-bed facility in February 2017. The transition included several profound changes in the department`s operating philosophy that affect daily work, such as closed patient rooms, the possibility of parents staying next to their child and replacement of all monitoring and warning systems while significantly increasing the area of the department. In the face of these extensive changes and the high risk to hospitalized patients during this transition period, a preparatory training program was prepared prior to the actual transition. Method: Analysis of the challenges involved in the transition raised several key points: the need to test systems and work procedures, assimilate the changes in the new work routine, familiarize with new equipment and obtain the ability to provide adequate emergent critical care in the new work environment. In order to meet these challenges, an In-Situ simulation-based training program was created in the new department. Results: Prior to the opening of the new department, the entire team underwent simulation-based training, which included 258 hours of training and testing of systems. Each simulation examined a different component of the daily work regime and management of extreme situations. Pitfalls were identified and re-examined in subsequent training. Throughout the simulation-based training, more than 173 potential pitfalls were identified at different levels of severity, including 38 severe pitfalls that could endanger patient care. Conclusions: Assessments and early simulation-based training in the new work environment allow early detection and correction of significant pitfalls and risks prior to moving to a new work environment. In addition, simulation reduces the level of anxiety and fear from transition, while increasing the responsiveness and readiness of the staff with a significant impact on the quality and safety of patient care. Introduction: Pain self-reporting is currently a 'golden-standard' tool for pain assessment. However, it varies from patient to patient and could be inaccurately understood by healthcare professionals. According to several studies, acute as well as chronic pediatric pain remains misunderstood, under-diagnosed, and still under-treated. Moreover, accurate pain diagnostic markers are still missing. Aims: To investigate salivary cortisol and melatonin concentrations in children with acute pain. To compare it with pain severity and vital signs changes. Methods: We conducted pilot observational study in Kauno Klinikos Pediatric emergency department (PED). Twenty-six patients referred to PED due to acute pain were included into the study. We excluded patients with chronical conditions, under pain-killers or hormonal treatment. We recorded patient's gender, age, vital signs (heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature (t\u00b0) and oxygen saturation (SaO2)), pain characteristics (severity and duration of pain). Saliva samples were collected and stored in -80\u00b0C till cortisol and melatonin ELISA analysis. Results: Sixteen boys and 10 girls were involved in our research. Age median was10 (4-16) years. Fourteen cases were trauma patients, 12 cases referred due to pain of other origin. we observed increased HR and BP due to pain. Other parameters were within age range. The median of cortisol and melatonin were 287.5(68-1330) and 17,6(8.6-46.8) pg/ml respectively. There was tendency of melatonin reduction with increased intensity of pain, however it was not significant (p=0.136). The longer the pain lasted, the higher cortisol levels were identified (p=0.01). No link was found between abnormal vital signs and changes in biomarkers. Conclusion: Primary results show a cortisol rise with regard to pain duration. A drop in melatonin levels was observed with increasing pain. These results show cortisol and melatonin as potential biomarkers in acute pain diagnostics. Introduction: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless, non-irritating, yet significantly toxic gas and is considered the leading cause of death by poisoning in the world. The clinical picture is variable and non-specific, ranging from mild to severe. Pediatric age range is a risk group, due to central nervous system immaturity and accelerated basal metabolism. In children, the clinical progression is more aggressive and difficult to detect than in adults. Clinical Case: The following cases describe two siblings who were observed in a Pediatric Emergency Department. Case 1: A 10-year-old female, who after awakening suddenly from bitemporal headache, briefly lost consciousness but recovered within minutes. After recovering, she had an episode of vomiting. The patient's physical examination was normal. ABG: pH 7.39, lact 1.4, COHb 25.2%. Case 2: A 7-year-old male, after waking to use the toilet, began having a headache and feeling dizzy with lipothymia, but recovered in minutes. The patient's physical examination was normal. ABG: pH 7.37, lact 1.4, COHb 21.7%. Both parents remained asymptomatic.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of CO intoxication was made, and the treatment protocol was fulfilled with oxygen therapy in a hyperbaric chamber. Two treatment sessions were performed, with the first treatment at 2 hours after hospital admission and the second occurring 12 hours later.Both patients were discharged 24 hours after the onset of the disease, with no associated symptomatology. Patients were instructed to follow up with a consultation with Hyperbaric Medicine at the 1st, 3rd and 6th month after the occurrence. Conclusion: These two cases demonstrate the importance of clinical judgment to a rather linear history. Correct and timely diagnosis is essential, to ensure rapid action and minimization of possible associated complications. The coordination of the team and between several services is essential. Background: 1 in 5 children will sustain a traumatic brain injury by the age of 16 years, with 90% of these being concussion. The majority recover to baseline function within 4 weeks, however 31% suffer from persisting symptoms. There is a lack of clear, consistent guidelines in the UK about management, discharge advice and follow-up of children with concussion. In our Paediatric Emergency department (PED) there was no follow-up arranged for any patients and no patient information leaflet. Objectives: The aim was to identify any patients with concussion suffering from ongoing symptoms of post-concussion syndrome (PCS), who would benefit from follow-up. Additionals aims were to create an advice leaflet about concussion to be given to patients and make recommendations regarding systematic follow-up for future patients with concussion. Methods: A search was conducted for patients aged 16 or under, discharged from the PED in the last 15 months, with a diagnosis concussion. Their medical notes were reviewed and a telephone survey of parents was conducted asking about current symptoms of PCS. Results: The search yielded 121 patients. 68 of 121 parents of patients were able to be contacted. Of these, 33 out of 68 reported symptoms of PCS (48.53%) of new onset since their head injury, lasting longer than 4 weeks. School-aged children (5-12 years) were most commonly affected. The most common post-concussive symptoms reported were headaches, and problems with temper and impulsiveness. Conclusion: Concussion management was found to be an area for improvement in this PED. A letter was written to the 33 children with PCS symptoms to arrange follow-up, and a new concussion leaflet for parents and patients was created to ensure follow-up was sought in the case of ongoing symptoms. Recommendations were made about the importance of starting systematic follow-up of all children with a diagnosis of concussion. ",

            "text": "Background: Limp is a common presentation and accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits in children. It is difficult to clinically differentiate benign, self-limiting conditions like transient synovitis, from more serious conditions such as septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. It is therefore imperative to investigate and manage appropriately. Currently, there are no national guidelines for the investigation and management of limp in children in the UK. Objective: The aim of this audit was to see how many children presenting with limp to the Children's Clinical Decision Unit were being correctly investigated and managed according to local guidelines. Additional aims were to see if any significant diagnoses were missed and to update the guidelines as appropriate. Methods: A search was done for patients presenting with limp to our Children's Clinical Decision Unit, within the last 6 months. Their electronic medical records were then reviewed for details of their admission, investigations, diagnosis and any missed diagnoses. These were compared to local guidelines at Oxford University Hospitals Trust. Results: The search found 106 patients. All patient should have had bloods and an x-ray, according to our guidelines. 33 of the 106 patients had the correct initial investigations. Those with 2 or more risk factors for septic arthritis should have had an ultrasound and this occurred in 10 of 15 patients. The most common diagnosis was transient synovitis (45 out of 106) and there were 2 cases of osteomyelitis and 1 case of septic arthritis. There were 4 missed diagnoses including 1 case of osteomyelitis. Conclusion: Adherence to limp guidelines was poor and as a result significant pathology was missed. Recommendations included increased education of doctors about the limp management guidelines, creation of limp proforma and reinforcing mandatory telephone reviews after discharge. Further ongoing work includes reviewing and updating the limp guidelines. The study concentrated on data related to trauma mechanism in children (n=134) with blunt abdominal trauma like clinical findings, affected organs, results of radiologic imaging and clinical outcome. Points of interest were patient\u00b4s age and sex, time and season of accident, mechanism of injury, involved objects, severity of injuries, treatment and complications. Accident mechanisms varied depending on age and male patients had higher severe grades of injury pattern (p=0.008). Boys are more often (in 67,9%) involved to suffer an intraabdominal injury (IAI) with severe grades of injury pattern (p=0.014). Depending on age, proportions of various accident mechanisms occurred. Leading trauma was in 56% a fall, most common less than 1meter, followed by sport related trauma (41,8%) and road traffic accidents (21.6%). In children with abnormal laboratory studies the grade injury pattern was more severe (p0,001). Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) was primary performed in 85,8% and correlation between free abdominal fluid and injury pattern was significant (p0.001). 41,8% had an IAI with organ laceration and 46,3% had additionally injuries like head or thorax trauma. Conservative treatment of IAI was performed in 60,7% (n=34) and invasive treatment with abdominal surgery in 39,2% (n=22). Complications occurred in 34.4%, significantly after spleen (p=0.001), liver (p=0,001) and GI-tract injuries (p=0,001). Hospital duration stay increased with severity of injury (p0.001), especially after child abuse. Despite rarity of massive IAI after child abuse, it is vital for the affected children that involved medical staff kept this potential trauma issue in mind. We showed that risks for suffering severe IAI are present even during everyday activities, not just in traffic accidents. Focus should be on prevention on risk children, adapted to their age and danger potential. Parents have to be enlightened about risks directly and should train their children to perceive them. Purpose: E-bikes are being used increasingly by all age groups. Children riding e-bikes often do not use safety equipment such as helmets, and are at increased risk for injuries requiring neurosurgery. The most common type of injury among pediatric e-bikers is head and neck trauma. We describe our experience treating cranial injuries. Methods: Data regarding children (18 years old) with e-bike-related cranial injuries were collected retrospectively from two tertiary centers. Results: Twenty patients were included. Seventeen were e-bike users, and three were hit as pedestrians. The average age at admission was 11.3 \u00b1 4.85 (range 1.5-17) years old. All 17 e-bike users did not wear a helmet. Seventeen of the 20 (85%) suffered from skull fractures (70% involving the frontal bone), nine involving more than one region. Six patients (30%) had intracerebral contusions, 3 (15%) an epidural hematoma, and 6 (30%) a subdural hematoma. Three patients (15%) underwent surgery, two of them for depressed skull fracture reduction, and one for insertion of intracranial pressure monitor. One patient died (5%); 1 (5%) had a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 3, 5 (25%) had a GOS of 2, and 13 (65%) were discharged without any neurological deficit (GOS 1).",

Introduction: Laceration repair is one of the most common procedures performed in pediatric emergency department (PED). The objective of this study was to define the factors of care that are important to caregivers during a pediatric laceration repair and overall ED satisfaction. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observation study performed in an urban, tertiary hospital. A convenience sample of patients younger than 18 years old presenting to PED for laceration repair was recognized and their caregivers were enrolled to complete a survey developed for this study. Demographic data of patient and caregivers were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine which of these factors are related to satisfaction in the process of laceration repair and the overall ED process. Results: Total 55 caregivers were enrolled. 39(70.9%) of the caregivers were fathers. Majority of children had facial laceration (n=44, 80%) and median ED length of stay was 181 (IQR, 157-208) minutes. the median age of the children was 41.8 (IQR, 23-91) months and the median age of the caregivers were 37 years old (IQR, (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . Most of the laceration was repaired by plastic surgeons (81.8%). In the multivariate regression analysis, 'preparing before procedure', 'mid-income family', 'caring attitude of nurse', 'cosmetic outcome', and 'measures to control patient's anxiety' were significantly related to the caregiver's satisfaction about the laceration repair (p0.05), while 'preparing before procedure' and 'ED environment' were significantly related to the caregiver's satisfaction about the overall ED process (p0.05). Conclusions: 'Preparing before procedure' was significantly related to the caregiver's satisfaction in both pediatric laceration repair and overall PED experience. The strongest predictors were 'cosmetic outcome' for laceration repair process and 'prepare for the procedure' for overall PED experience. Our findings suggest that improvements in various aspects will result in more satisfied parents. ",

            "text": "Background: Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a rare genetic condition caused by partial deletion of short arm of chromosome 4. Clinical manifestations comprise but not limited to typical facie, mental retardation, growth delay, epilepsy, and congenital cardiac defects. Congenital heart defects occur in about 25-50% of cases. Objective: We describe a child with WHS presenting with a femoral fracture who went apnoeic in the course of management resulting in a cascade of events. Methods: Clinical presentation, laboratory and radiological findings are discussed. Results: A 4.5-year-old boy known to have WHS was admitted with left femoral fracture. The syndrome was an antenatal diagnosis. Other associations noted were severe growth delay (weight of 6kg), epilepsy, global developmental delay, visual impairment, and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). His TOF has been managed uneventfully on propranolol with acceptable oxygen saturation (Sp02) in the 70s. The spontaneous fracture required Gallows traction, which provoked distress. He developed hypoxic crisis requiring oxygen therapy to maintain acceptable SpO2. Subsequently, he went apnoeic and dusky needing bag and mask ventilation. Blood gas revealed severe metabolic acidosis, which improved after fluid bolus. Kneechest position could not be attempted due to the fracture. Although he got treated for suspected sepsis due to the dilemma of events, he did have a hypercyanotic spell in hindsight. He was subsequently discharged with conservative management of the fracture. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypercyanotic (Tet) spell in WHS. This rather uncommon event resulted in a significant learning point for medical and nursing staff.",

            "text": "Objective: To survey the clinical experiences of junior doctors in the resuscitation room and establish probable factors affecting patient safety before and after implementation of key recommendations. Methods: An initial survey on the experiences of junior doctors during assessment of children in resus bays was conducted in October 2018. Some recommendations deduced were implemented; provision of sepsis trolley and grab box. A repeat survey in January 2019 was done to evaluate impact of implemented changes. Results: Twenty doctors participated in the initial survey while 19 in the later survey. First survey was designated T1 and the repeat survey T2. All respondents reported attending at least 2 resuscitations in both surveys. Ten percent in T1 vs. 35% in T2 responded that a nurse was always present during resuscitation events. Ninety percent had performed or assisted in at least 1 procedure in the resuscitation bay in both surveys. Using a 5-point Likert scale, 40% of respondents in T1 vs. 63% in T2 were satisfied with the level of support of ED staff. Easy access to materials for resuscitation was rated good by 10% in T1 vs. 81% in T2. Over 70% in either survey requested resuscitation drugs; promptness of drug retrieval and administration was rated good by 13% (T1) vs. 45% (T2). The grab box was used by 65% in T2 with excellent feedbacks on its fall-back benefit. Conclusion: Significant improvement was noted in care delivery following the implementation of the new sepsis trolley and grab box. There still exist areas for continued development in enhancing safe care delivery in this mixed adult and children ED. Background: Post-extubation Acute Pulmonary Oedema (PEAPO) occurs in 0.1% of patients undergoing general anaesthesia, mostly in healthy children and young individuals, usually immediately after tracheal extubation. In paediatric age it has been rarely described, but the actual incidence is thought to be underestimated as many cases of post-operative respiratory distress may be misdiagnosed. Case report: A former healthy 15-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms and physical examination compatible with acute appendicitis. A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed under general anaesthesia. Immediately after extubation, during which neither aspiration nor vomit were observed, he developed hypoxaemia (SpO 2 82%), intense coughing and polypnea, requiring additional O 2 (FiO 2 40% using Venturi mask). He was hemodynamically stable, with normal cardiac auscultation and without oedema. His thorax expansion was symmetrical, and pulmonary auscultation presented symmetrical decreased breath sounds with dispersed fine crackles. Arterial gasometry showed pH 7.36, pCO 2 45mmHg, pO 2 48mmHg, HCO 3 -26.8mmol/L, BE -0.5mmol/L, and the chest radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse opacities with ill-defined edges, suggesting acute pulmonary oedema. Intravenous furosemide was administered, and a quick recovery was noticed. The drug was maintained during 3 days, as well as supplementary oxygen, with progressive decreasing. With favourable evolution, the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery, asymptomatic, with normal cardiac evaluation and chest radiograph. Conclusion: Although rare, PEAPO is a potentially fatal complication, which may worsen the prognosis of low-risk surgical procedures. It is important to recall this diagnosis in children and adolescents who present signs of respiratory distress and hypoxia after general anaesthesia, as prompt intervention is essential for a favourable outcome. Background: Paediatric emergencies can be challenging and intimidating for providers in the pre-hospital setting. Pre-hospital practitioners require a skill set very different to interventions performed in the adult population. These include challenging intravenous access, medication calculation, potential external stressors and a variety of clinical conditions seen less frequently. Methodology: Pre-hospital Grand Rounds (PHGR) is a relatively new concept. It was introduced in St Vincent's University Hospital Dublin with the programme in University Hospital Limerick (UHL) commencing in October 2018. Following discussion with pre-hospital colleagues in the midwest region the coordinators of PHGR UHL acknowledged the importance and potential benefit of inclusion of paediatric cases at each session. A survey was conducted to gauge pre-hospital provider views on PHGR UHL as a source of paediatric emergency education. Discussion: At each meeting a case is presented by a paramedic or advanced paramedic. This includes assessments, interventions on scene and subsequent handover in the Emergency Department. An Emergency Department doctor subsequently discusses the management of the child and outcome. A brief teaching session related to the primary diagnosis follows in an open forum with the audience, consisting of pre-hospital providers, nursing and medical staff. The meeting is supervised by a Consultant in Emergency Medicine with input from the Department of Paediatrics and National Ambulance Service training officers. When surveyed, participants considered PHGR UHL as an educational resource for paediatric emergencies, considered the meeting to add to their practice and found paediatric emergencies posed different challenges to the adult population. Conclusion: The introduction of paediatric cases at PHGR UHL has been met with enthusiasm and in its infancy is being considered a beneficial resource. It creates a link of communication between pre-hospital clinicians and hospital providers. The meetings do not follow a template but are developed through feedback and communication between all parties. Background: Syncope is a symptom characterised by transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion. 30-50% of children and adolescents experience a faint. Syncope results in 1-3% of all visits to the Paediatric Emergency Department. While benign pathology dominates, recurrent events, ancillary injuries or anxiety around sinister pathology can bias clinical judgement. Resulting heterogeneity in clinical care drives wasteful investigations or referrals to oversubscribed services. Here we review stateof-the-art International Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) which may be used to reduce disease burden. Methods: Structured review of Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases performed using search terms: (\"Clinical Practice Guideline\" AND \"Paediatric\" (OR \"Pediatric\") AND \"Syncope\"), (\"Patient Algorithm\" OR \"Diagnostic Algorithm\" AND \"Paediatric\" AND \"Syncope\"). Results: Our search generated 126 articles, with further review yielding five CPG's: European Society of Cardiology 2018 , American Heart Association 2017 , Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Pediatric Cardiology Association 2017 , NICE 2011 , Chinese Pediatric Cardiology Society 2018 . Guidelines used \"Class I Evidence\" or \"Strong Recommendation\" to support the role of the following: History (peri-event features), Physical Examination plus Family History (Epilepsy, premature cardiac death in 1 st /2 nd degree relative 40yrs). All but one endorsed ECG as a necessary diagnostic test. In the absence of positive findings, no further investigation is required. While presence of symptoms related to exertion should receive diagnostic work-up with referral to specialist services e.g. syncope unit, cardiology. Reassurance, education/ lifestyle measures remain the cornerstone of clinical management. Guidelines expanded on this to include medication use for refractory cases, maintaining psychological wellbeing and autonomic function training. Discussion: Adherence to evidence-based guidelines ensures clinically appropriate management of syncope, whilst reducing wasteful investigations or referrals. Although all guidelines reviewed agree on history and examination, specific differences around ECG use, or nonpharmacological treatment exist. Background: Birth Asphyxia can lead to severe hypoxic ischaemic organ damage in newborns followed by neurodegenerative diseases, mental retardation and epilepsies, leading to significant mortality and morbidity in the Intensive Care Unit at the University Children Hospital-Skopje. Objective: The aim of this study was to determining the corelation between the levels of PCT levels in pretern newborns with asphyxia and term newborns with asphyxia, with sepsis and proven blood culture Methods: In this study we include the 31 (M:F=14:17) sepsis newborns with asphyxia and proven blood culture. They have been divided into two groups I group included 11 septic preterm newborns with asphyxia and II group -20 septic term newborns.. Results of WBC, C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT, were recorded. Procalcitonin levels was assessed before the beginning of the antibiotic treatment and second measurement after 3 days, by using a immunoassay system Vidas based on the Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) principles. Results: We confirmed Staphylococcus , methicillin-resistance gene in all preterm newborns. 14 term newborns were with confirmed Staphylococcus , methicillin-resistance gene and in other 6 term newborns were confirmed Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pneumonia. The values of procalcitonin (PCT) were considerably increased in septic preterm newborns with asphyxia, relative to term newborns. This difference was statistically significant. The values of C-reactive protein gradually increase after 24-36 hours in both groups. The second measurement of PCT after 3 days is a parameter, who show us whether an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment is used and may prevent severe sepsis and septic shock in newborns.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Increased PCT level was significantly associated with preterm newborns with confirmed Staphylococcus , methicillin-resistance gene. The value of PCT is a reliable parameter whether an appropriate antibiotic treatment is used in newborns with asphyxia, and and gram positive blood culture Results: Over the ten years study period, 247 children 16 years were admitted to the ED with the diagnosis of OC\\POC. Mean age 5.2 \u00b1 4.5 years of age. OC documented in 50 patients. The mean age was 7.8 \u00b1 4.3 years. Fever (79.6%), URTI (42.9%), swelling of both eyelid (98%), proptosis (30.6%), and tenderness on percussion (24.5%) were all more common in comparison to POC with P values of 0.0001, 0.03, 0.0001, 0.0001,0.0001 respectively. All children with diagnosis of OC underwent CT scan. Abscess was documented in 63.3% of the OC patients. POC accounted for 247 patients. Mean age was 4.6 \u00b1 4.3 years. In 19.8% of the cases local trauma or bite mark in the infected eye were recorded. Mean leukocyte count (10 9 \\L) in OC group 15.2 vs 13.4 (P= 0.05), ANC was significantly higher in the OC 11.3 vs 7.2 (P=0.0001) whereas the lymphocyte count was higher in the POC 4.5 vs 2.4 (P= 0.0001). Laboratory inflammation signs in OC had mean CRP levels (MG%) of 11.7 vs 4.9 (P =0.0001) and ESR of 53.6 vs 36.4 (P= 0.02). Conclusion: Differentiation between OC an POC is cardinal. while previously findings on clinical examination such as ophthalmoplegia and proptosis were found indicative of OC rather than POC, our study highlights the importance of inflammatory markers including ANC, CRP and ESR in the assessment of infections of the eye. Background: Accidental poisoning with metamizol sodic, by confounding the number of drops with the number of milliliters are going to become an important problem of admission in our emergency department.

            "text": "Material and Methods: A retrospective study was performed. The study group includes 12 children admitted in the emergency room due to January 2017 until December 2018. Results and Discussions: In the study group, age between 7 months and 8 years, the children received a number of milliliters of metamizol sodic equal with the number of drops necessary. Time between ingestion and the admission in the emergency room varied between a few minutes (when the parents took note the incident), until 72 hours. The maximum dose was 15 grams. The symptomatology was severe (seizures, sleepiness) in 3 cases, moderate (vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, purpura) in 6 cases, 3 cases were asymptomatics. Laboratory investigations revealed leucopenia in 5 cases, trombocitopenia-1, hepatocytolisis -3, modifications of renal function tests-3, and in 3 were cases normal. The treatment consisted in gastric lavage-4 cases, forced diuresis, hepatoprotectives, corticosteroid therapy -3 cases. The outcome was favorable in all the cases, 3 children developed cutaneous rash and 2 bronchospasm after few days. Objectives and Study: Button battery ingestions epitomize the challenge among pediatric foreign body ingestions as the outcome can vary from harmless to lethal. The serious outcomes refer to children younger than 5years old and when ingested batteries are larger than 20mmdiameter(higher-risk patients). Esophagus is the target tissue of caustic injury and acute endoscopic treatment is needed. In cases, where battery lies beyond the esophagus (stomach, bowel etc) and the patient is asymptomatic, abdominal radiographs and observation are advocated. Endoscopic removal is suggested only if the battery remains inside the stomach 4 days after ingestion. Methods: We report two cases of toddlers, presented in our pediatric department, that ingested button batteries with their diagnostic X-rays. The first was a 3-year-old girl that ingested a battery smaller than 12mmdiameter (10mm) 2 1/2 hours prior to her admission. Her vital signs were stable (HR:108-114/min) and was asymptomatic. An X-ray was obtained that revealed a radiopaque object(battery) in the bowel. From the laboratory exams, only increased amylase levels were found(221U/l, with normal values:30-118U/l). The second was a 2.5-year-old girl that ingested a battery larger than 12mm-diameter ( 20mm) 1 hour prior to her admission. Her vital signs where stable (HR:100/min) and also remained asymptomatic. The X-ray that was performed revealed a battery in the stomach. No laboratory exams were obtained. Results: Both children received intravenous(iv) fluids and ranitidine as prophylaxis and were immediately transferred to a pediatric hospital with endoscopic unit. They remained asymptomatic throughout their stay and endoscopic intervention was not needed. The battery was dismissed through the stool in both cases, during the second( 2 nd ) and third( 3 rd ) day after ingestion, respectively. Conclusion: Button battery ingestions, where battery lies beyond the esophagus and the patient remains asymptomatic, should be managed with caution, as esophageal damage cannot be excluded. Endoscopic intervention should be within immediate reach whether or not it is actually performed in the end. Background: Children with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) has variety outcome in difference centers and country. Objective: The objective in this study was to report the prevalence, characteristic and outcomes of IHCA and also evaluate associated factors in survival. Methods: A retrospective study including children aged 1 month to 18 years were diagnosed with cardiac arrest and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation between January 2010 and December 2016. Descriptive and logistic regressions analysis was used to analyze factors that related to the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival. Results: Total of admission was 32,122. Of 88 patients (0.27%) were enrolled. Median age of patients was 1.21. The first documented rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (43%). The overall sustained ROSC and survival rate were 62.5% and 15.9%, respectively. Of 78% of those who survived had favorable neurological outcome. The most common cause of IHCA was septic shock. Ischemic cause, development of subsequent asystole and receiving CPR more than 20 minutes had significant higher sustained ROSC rate (p0.05). Multivariate analysis to adjust for the clinical variables significantly associated with failure ROSC confirmed that patients with prolonged duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and subsequent asystole had higher failure ROSC (p0.05). However, patients who received vasoactive medications less than two drugs had higher hospital survival rate (p=0.024). Conclusion: Duration of CPR was the most important factor associated with achieved ROSC, whereas number of vasoactive medications was the factor associated with hospital survival rate. The Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) was initially developed to pre-emptively identify hospitalized children who were at risk of clinical deterioration 1, 2 . A study in a paediatric Emergency Department (ED) found that an elevated score was associated with need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission 3 . A lot of PEWS systems have been developed but a recent systematic review noticed lack of consensus on which PEWS is most effective, although improved clinical outcomes were reported 4 . In July 2017 we implemented the Irish PEWS 5 in our paediatric ED aiming to objectify and improve clinical monitoring in our unit. The purpose of this study is to review our data by verifying if a higher PEWS score correlated to clinical deterioration and if it is applicable to our clinical practice. To do so we evaluated medical records of patients who were applied the PEWS between July 2017 and March 2019 and registered the maximum score (MS). We defined clinical deterioration as the need for ICU transfer, higher respiratory support or the presence of sepsis criteria. We evaluated 840 children admitted to the ED observation room, whose age and MS distributions are represented, respectively by the graphics 1 and 2.",

Respiratory diseases were the most common diagnosis (227 patients), with 135 (59%) MS \u22654, whose sensibility and specificity for clinical deterioration were, respectively, 100% and 48.9%. We also evaluated this score for MS of 5 and 6. In addition of being a system that allows a standardized surveillance, the use of this score seems to improve patient safety and medical decision, particularly by excluding clinical deterioration, as showed by the high sensitivity values reached using the MS of 4 as a cut-off. Background: Variety of sedation methods are applied for children treated in the PICU without clear evidence about their usefulness. Opioids and benzodiazepines have been a standard analgesic and sedative combination. Currently newer agents, like a2-adrenergic agonists have been proposed. Objective: To assess the principal sedative and analgesic drug choices for patients treated in a pediatric medical/surgical ICU. Methods: The study was conducted in a 24 bed complex of two intensive care units, surgical and medical, at one institution. A one day analysis was chosen. The medications, their methods of administration, and doses were analyzed. Results: There were 24 patients treated in both wards on the day of study, 20 of them required mechanical respiratory support. The majority of patients (13) were up to 3 days after surgery. The most common analgesic drug was morphine used in 16 children (in 9 as bolus, in 5 as infusion) administered for a median of 2 days (range 1-7), followed by non-opioid drugs (paracetamol and metamizole) in 6 cases, and sufentanil by infusion in 2. The major medication for sedation was midazolam (14 patients, in 5 as an infusion) administered for a median of 3 days (range 1-22), followed by dexmedetomidine infusion in 9 patients (median duration 4 days, range 1-22 days, mean 8 days). The doses of morphine were in the lower therapeutic range (mostly 0,1 mg/kg bolus), doses of dexmedetomidine were from 0,6 to 1,5 micrograms/kg/hr. Oral methadone was administered in 2 children, in one in combination with clonidine. Ten patients were treated concomitantly with 2 analgesic/sedative drugs, five 3 medications, four were receiving 4 drugs, and five one. Conclusion: In our study morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine were main analgesic and sedative drugs used in the PICU. Dexmedetomidine was used for longer periods of time than suggested by the manufacturer and literature. Introduction: Periodic Paralysis (PP) is a rare neuromuscular disease related to a defect in muscle ion channels, characterized by sporadic episodes of painless muscle weakness that can be precipitated by vigorous exercise, prolonged fasting, or carbohydrate-rich meals. PP is classified as hypokalemic when episodes occur associated with low levels of potassium in the blood. The crises start in late childhood or early adolescence and vary in frequency and duration. Treatment during the acute phase is administration of potassium chloride. Case Report: A 12-year-old female adolescent appealed to the emergency department due to sudden onset of tetraparesis. She had no difficulty breathing nor signs of respiratory distress. Cardiac, pulmonary and abdomen examination was normal. Conscious and oriented in time and space. Neurological examination showed grade II muscle strength in the lower limbs and grade III in the upper limbs. Osteotendinous reflexes were absent. Facial mimic was present. Upon this presentation the mother promptly revealed a familiar history of periodic hypokalemic paralysis affecting several members. Blood analysis showed an isolated severe hypokalemia of 1,7-2,0 mmol/L. ECG showed prolonged PR interval, mild ST depression, prominent U waves. Slow correction of potassium was promptly started with gradual recovery of muscle strength and ECG stabilization. She was discharged 20 hours after therapy onset and medicated at home with daily acetazolamide and potassium chloride if onset of symptoms. Genetic study was started for \u00edndex familial mutations. Conclusion: Periodic familial paralyzes are rare conditions, the most frequent being the hypokalemic form. The diagnosis of PP can be confirmed by genetic tests, which are recommended as first line when there is an intermediate to high degree of clinical suspicion. This case report is intended to emphasize the importance of the clinical history and a complete physical examination on diagnosis. Treatment should not be delayed. Genetic family counseling should be offered. Background: First-line treatment for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are oral rehydration solutions. These prepared solutions are recommended by WHO and ESPGHAN since they assure a right replacement of hydroelectrolitic disbalance, advising against other alternatives. 'Alkaline lemonade' is a home-made alternative to prepared solutions, made with water, sugar, salt, lemon and baking soda. It has been widely recommended and extensively used in Spain due to its availability and effectiveness. We report a case of metabolic alkalosis and electrolytic disturbances in a patient with AGE, who was treated with 'alkaline lemonade'. Case Presentation: A previously healthy 11-month-old boy was brought to the Emergency Department with an AGE caused by Norovirus. On his arrival he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, with signs of moderate dehydration. Admission blood tests revealed metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.54, pCO2 45.7 mmHg and bicarbonate 38.4 mmol/L), hypokalemia (2.3 mmol/L) and hypernatremia (145 mmol/L), with normochloremia, were observed in first blood tests. The electrocardiogram showed flat T-waves in all derivations, without any other changes. He was admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, where a fast correction of hypokalemia was performed, with disappearance of electrocardiogram disturbances. He received intravenous fluid therapy until complete recovery of detected alterations. Due to the importance of disturbances, tubulopathies were ruled out. When the parents were asked about their son's home management, they reported having administered home-made 'alkaline lemonade', without being able to specify the amount of baking soda, but bigger than the recommended 'point of knife' quantity. Therefore, the 'alkaline lemonade' poisoning along with the dehydration caused by AGE, explain the magnitude of ionic and acid-base disorders. Conclusions: 'Alkaline lemonade' recipe is not very accurate, which can lead to elaboration mistakes, as our patient\u00b4s case. In conclusion, we should recommend oral rehydration solutions for AGE management and inform appropriately about their alternatives. Background: Falls are the third leading cause of death by unintentional injury in European Union children and represent an important cause of incapacity. There is lack of scientific research on the less-than-6-monthold group. Objective: To describe epidemiologic characteristics, outcomes and factors related to a worse outcome of falls in a specific age group children. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of all infants younger than 6 months admitted to our Emergency Room (ER) because of unintentional fall. The study was conducted at a second level Portuguese hospital over a 7-year period (2012 through 2018). Results: There were 112 ER admissions related with falls in this group (0,045% of all admissions). Forty-eight percent had fallen from baby equipment. The majority (82,4%) occurred from a 50-100cm high and head trauma was present in 94,8%. Symptoms occurred in 23,2% of infants and head injury was the most common finding on medical examination (47,3%). Serious injuries were seen in 16,1%. Imaging abnormalities were identified in 7,1% (all with head fracture; one third with brain injury) and 6,3% required hospital admission or transference to another hospital. Serious injury was more frequent in infants younger than 3 months (66,7% vs 33,3%, p=0,009), in those who had fallen from more than 76cm high (p=0,013) and when medical examination revealed alterations (72,2% vs 27,8%, p=0,032). Radiography with suspected skull fracture was significantly associated with fracture on computed tomography (p=0,033). No deaths or permanent sequelae were found. Conclusion: In our study the most serious injuries occurred in infants younger than 3 months and from relatively small heights. Although present in almost 10%, fractures and brain injury didn't have long term sequelae. It is important to reinforce the importance of preventive and supervision measures. Background: Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of presentation and hospitalization for infants in Australia and New Zealand. Multiple clinical practice guidelines have been published to minimize unnecessary interventions in infants with bronchiolitis; however, the challenge is translating the knowledge and evidence into clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this audit cycle was to determine if standard education process of the updated bronchiolitis guideline in a tertiary paediatric emergency department (ED) will reduce unnecessary interventions in infants with bronchiolitis. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted in a tertiary paediatric ED of bronchiolitis presentations in 2015 (pre-education cohort of 465 presentations) and in 2017 (post education cohort of 343 presentations) after implementation of the updated guideline prior to the 2017 bronchiolitis season. The primary outcome was to evaluate the rate of interventions shown to be ineffectual in the updated guideline with secondary outcomes evaluating the rate of hospital, ICU admissions and the rate of multiple interventions versus single intervention. Results: There was no difference found between 2015 and 2017 for chest x-ray, salbutamol, adrenaline, antibioitics and nasopharyngeal aspirates. There was increased use of glucocorticoids with increased odds of 60% (p=0.002) which was statistically significant. There was no difference with the number of interventions between 2015 and 2017. Hospital admissions were reduced from 2015 to 2017 (65.2% versus 56.0% respectively), with reduced odds of admission of 18% (p=0.008) that was statistically significant. There was no difference in ICU admissions. Conclusion: The updated guideline through standard education process in ED did not show any statistically significant reduction of unnecessary interventions. Community initiated glucocorticoid administration, however, was increased. A larger multi-centered study will be beneficial to determine if the awareness of the guideline to the broader community would reduce unnecessary interventions as well as the challenge of translating current evidence into clinical practice. Background: In recent years, the incidence of type 1 diabetes has been increasing in children. The prognosis is related to acute metabolic complications, mainly ketoacidosis. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study of patients admitted with inaugural ketoacidosis of type 1 diabetes to ICU of Pediatric Department in Fattouma Bourguiba Hospital of Monastir over 10-year period from 2008 to 2017. Results: A hospital incidence of the inaugural ketoacidosis was 2 per 1,000. The rate of the inaugural ketoacidosis among new diabetes cases was 22.52%. Fifty patients were collected: 23 girls and 27 boys. The mean age at admission was 6.6 \u00b1 4.1 years. The mean time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 15.51 \u00b1 9.27 days. Polyuro-polydipsic syndrome and massive ketonuriawas found respectively in 98% and 82% of cases. Mean blood glucose at the time of diagnosis was 4.92 +/-0.14 g/L. 16 children were treated according to modified Lestradet protocol and 34 childrenwere treated according to modified ISPAD protocol. Correction of blood glucose, ketonuria, pH and bicarbonates up to H8 were without significant difference between the two protocols (p0.05). The most common complication in the acute phase was hypokalemia (8 cases). No cases of cerebral edema were observed. Conclusion: The inaugural ketoacidosis in children remains common in our region. Early diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is important to prevent complications. Background: Delayed puberty (DP) is described as central or peripheral whether the problem lies in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis or in the gonads respectively. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a central cause of DP due to a failure of gonadotrofin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion impairing the physiological initiation of puberty. Objective and Methods: We present three intra-familial cases of normosmic IHH (nIHH) related to a new association of two heterozygotic TARC3 mutations. Case Report: The index case reports to a 16 years-old male with no pubertal development at this age. Later, two of his three sisters also presented complete hypogonadism. All cases had a normal sense of smell. Investigation showed low sex steroid and gonadotropin levels and no evidence of a mass lesion in cerebral MRI. The diagnosis of nIHH was supported by the identification of two heterozygous mutations on TACR3 gene in all subjects. Conclusion: Congenital IHH is a very rare genetic disorder that if undiagnosed or untreated may lead to infertility associated to complete or partial absence of GnRH.TACR3 mutations have a critical importance on sexual maturation and are an important genetic cause of nIHH. The treatment of nIHH is based on sex steroids replacement, therefore promoting the pubertal development. Background: Regular exercise has important health and social benefits for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Different exercise types, intensity and duration have significantly different effects on blood glucose (BG) control, and on the endocrine response to exercise. There have been significant recent Improvements in the knowledge of what underlies these changes and in the appropriate management to support the maintenance of euglycemia. This effects frequently presents additional barriers to exercisefear of hypoglycemia and loss of glycemic controlincreasing sedentary lifestyle in this population. Thus, exercise presents several important challenges to diabetes management, and requires special management by patients and clinicians, based on the knowledge of the impact of exercise on BG homeostasis. Objective: To systematize the principles of exercise prescription in pediatric population with DMT1, including practical advices in the management of the metabolic control. Methods: Systematic literature searching in PubMed database. Two types of literature were reviewed: guidance and published studies. Conclusion: The most recent studies show the positive effects of exercise on cardiovascular risk management, helping to achieve target lipid profile, body composition and fitness and glycaemic goals. This population should be encouraged to practice a wide variety of exercise, with a careful management to ensure a good metabolic control. In general, aerobic exercise tends to lower BG concentrations, while anaerobic exercise tends to increase them. Both exercise types can be performed by children and adolescent with T1DM, and exercise prescription must be individualized, based on a sound understanding of the underlying physiology and adapted to the patient`s characteristics. The collaboration between the child/adolescent, healthcare provider, parents, school and the physical education instructor is crucial to a good adherence, promoting an optimal glycemic control during and after exercise.",

            "text": "Background: Young adults with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for acute complications during their transition from pediatric into adult care. While there is likely considerable variation in how transition care is structured, there is little evidence about the impact that this variation may have on patient outcomes in early adulthood. Objectives: To determine how young adults with type 1 diabetes transition into adult care in two Canadian provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) and Ontario (ON); to examine the impact of different models of transition care on outcomes for patients with type 1 diabetes; and to explore ways to better support patients with type 1 diabetes as they transition into adult care. Design: Mixed methods: Administrative data and qualitative research. Results: There are significant variations in how the transition to adult care was structured both within and between provinces. The rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in ON youth (n=2,525) was higher in those aged 19-21 years compared to 15-17 years (12.0 vs. 9.3/100 person-years, p0.0018). There was no difference in the rate across transition-age in youth from NL (n=93). In NL, there was no dedicated transition program for much of the province. We helped develop and evaluate a single session transfer clinic. We found that such a clinic is a promising step towards improving patient and parent satisfaction without requiring new staff or significant outlays of new resources. It is unclear whether such a clinic will ultimately impact rates of hospitalizations or DKA. Conclusion: In two Canadian provinces with different transition models and levels of resources, we found consistency in poor outcomes. Adverse events for this vulnerable population are high in both provinces and efforts to optimize system-level transition care are needed. Methods: The clinical case was analysed using patient history and clinical examination, laboratory, genetic, radiological and histological investigations, treatment methods and follow-up procedures. Results: 6 years 4 months old female presented with early pubertal development, tall stature and a large abdominal mass. Height 135cm(+3.2 SDS) weight 30.45kg(+2.0 SDS). Tanner puberty stage III: Px4, Ax1, Ma3, Me1. Signs of virilization were present. Laboratory data: significantly elevated estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, alfa-fetoprotein, beta-hCG and AMH. LH and FSHprepubertal level. Bone age(RUS score-598 points) corresponded to an age of 12.2. MRI showed large heterogeneous mass(CC 25.1cm, LL 18.9cm, AP 10.3cm) on left ovary. Left periaortic lymph nodes(LN) were increased. An operation was done after ovarian tumour was confirmed by MRI. Tumour and two additional LN were completely resected, biopsies were taken. Histological report: left ovarian dysgerminoma with metastasis in periovarian LN. However, the tumour was hormonally active, therefore, Sertoli cell component could not be excluded. Consultation from Finnish pathologists suggested dysgerminoma in combination with gonadoblastoma. Karyotype analysis of blood was 46,XX. Skin biopsy excluded mosaicism. Four courses of chemotherapy were done. Further follow-up was provided by a multidisciplinary team. Blood analysis was taken to monitor hormone levels in each hospital visit. Skeletal scintigraphy, chest CT, abdomen MRI was done after chemotherapyno metastasis was found. Conclusions: A delayed precocious puberty diagnosis has caused this child significant health issues: hormonal disbalance, prognostic small adult height, therapeutical side effects from chemotherapy, increased risk for metastasis and secondary tumour development. For an early diagnosis of possible malignity, every child needs to be evaluated at least once a year (development, secondary sex traits by Tanner) and parents need to be educated. Successful diagnostic, therapeutic result and follow-up monitoring can only be achieved by a multidisciplinary team. Background: Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia/hyposmia. Description: Female, 14 years old, without relevant personal or family history, referred because of pubertal delay (pubarche at age 13, without thelarche). She denied symptoms of neurological or other organs impairment, practice of strenuous physical exercise, restrictive eating behavior, illicit drug use and history of traumatic brain injury. The investigation performed before showed low estradiol levels and ultrasonography with small uterus, atrophic ovaries and horseshoe kidneys. She had good general condition, no dysmorphism, normal external genitalia and Tanner pubertal stage I (P3, B1, A3). Her growth velocity suffered progressive and slight slowdown after 10 years, but her height was still on the 50 th percentile. Complementary study showed low values of gonadotropins, 46XX karyotype and delayed bone age. LH-RH test revealed low values of FSH, LH and estradiol. KS was hypothesized and after a detailed inquiry anosmia/hyposmia was confirmed. Brain MRI showed bulbs and olfactory tracts atrophy and a small pituitary gland. Molecular analysis of the GnRHR and KAL1 gene by cyclic sequencing was normal, but the study proceeded to a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) multigene panel approach that identified a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in the KS gene FGF8 gene (c.283CG, p.Gln95Glu). Pubertal induction was performed with transdermal estrogens, and after menarche combined hormonal therapy was started. Conclusions: In pubertal delay with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and despite its rarity KS should be considered and anosmia/hyposmia should be searched for. Brain MRI shows typical anomalies in most cases. The genetic cause is recognized in only 30% of cases. Early diagnosis and hormone replacement prevent the physical and psychological consequences of pubertal delay. NGS approaches will contribute to reveal the molecular basis of a larger number of cases and may bring better understanding and classification of these disorders. Background: The alterations in a telomeric imprinting region 1 (ICR 1) in 11p15 chromosome and a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7)mat) may not be detected by molecular analyses in approximately 50% patients with characteristic features of Russell-Silver syndrome. Patient and Methods: A twenty month-old boy with triangular shaped face, midface hypoplasia, prominent forehead, wide, but thin mouth, small chin, low positioned ears, occipitofacial circumference (OFC) (-2.3 SDS) had low weight (-3.75 SDS), short stature (-4.6 SDS) and body asymmetry with bigger left side and longer left limbs for 1cm. The boy was born with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), birth weight (-4.8 SDS) and birth length (-1.7 SDS), in 38th gestational week (GW). The diagnostic assessment was achieved by clinical features, ultrasound survey, hormonal and molecular analyses. Results: The IGF1, IGF BP3 and thyroid hormones were within reference range. The tests for pituitary reserve revealed a peak of 8.64ng/ml. The ultrasound survey revealed hypoplastic right kidney and mild hypertrophy of the myocard. Karyotype was 46, XY. Multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) and a methylation analysis (MS-MLPA) did not detect hypomethilation of the ICR1 or a upd(7)mat. The growth hormone treatment is planned to be commenced. Conclusions: Herein we present a twenty month-old IUGR born boy with typical clinical features of Russell-Silver syndrome. The molecular analyses unfortunately did not confirm hypometilation in the critical region of chromosome 11p15 or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. Data was retrospectively collected from Electronic Patient Records for a 12-month period between June 2017 and June 2018. There were 100 CYP's with T1DM, of which 50 were commenced on FGMS. Funding sought appropriately before being commenced on sensor. CYP's and families were also made aware of the fact that funding can be withdrawn after a 6-month trial period if outcomes were unmet. HbA1c at the start of the trial was compared with HbA1c at 3, 6 and 9 months. Results: The HbA1c at the start of the trial was 65.1 mmol/mol; which showed an 8.1% improvement at 3 months, 12.3% at 6 months and 12.8% at 9 months. 67% discontinued the use of the FGMS, as qualitative evidence reported it to be unreliable. 2 of these children, recommenced the FGMS.",

The improvement in HbA1c is marked if the sensor was started within 6 months of diagnosis compared to those who have had T1DM for longer. Education is crucial before the start of sensor so that families and CYP's are well equipped to get the best out of it.

Precocious Puberty is defined by the onset of pubertal development at an age 2-2,5 standard deviations earlier than the normal population, which means before nine years old in boys and eight years in girls. Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) is diagnosed when the hypothalamicpituitary axis is activated. Although the majority of CPP causes are idiopathic, secondary causes should be discharged because of pathologic conditions with significant risk of morbidity and even death. Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of secondary CPP in the Portuguese population in the last five years, to characterize anthropometric and imagological features and identify its clinical predictors. Methods: Cross-sectional study from a National Digital Database, enrolled from eleven Public and Private Pediatric Endocrine Departments. Cases reported from January 2013 to December 2017. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS TM 23.0 version. Results: A total of 210 cases presented CPP during the last five years. 187 (89%) were female. The median age of diagnosis was 6,5 years old in idiopathic CPP and 4,8 years old in secondary CPP (p=0,002). Only 146 (69.5%) enrolled hypophyses/cranial image and secondary cases of CPP were identified in 38 patients (26%). Tumors were diagnosed in ten cases (26,3% of the secondary CPP) and the most frequent was hamartoma in 60%. From the secondary cases of CPP only 17 were male (12%) and there were no significant differences among gender when considering idiopathic/secondary cases. There was a negative correlation between the age of clinical manifestations (p0.001) and secondary CPP. Conclusions: CPP is more frequent in girls, either in idiopathic or secondary cases. The yearly age of clinical manifestations is a better predictor than gender in the diagnosis of secondary CPP. Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for the development and maturation of the central nervous system. Serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is an important chemical and neurotransmitter in the human body. It appears to play a key role in neural activities and social behaviors. The effects of TH and serotonin during development of CNS appear similar. Transient hypothyroidism is common in children with impaired CNS maturation. The levels of serotonin production in these children remain unclear. Objective: To evaluate serotonin levels and thyroid status in children with impaired growth and neuropsychological development. The development of cataracts at the onset of type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an uncommon complication in the pediatric population (prevalence of around 1%). It most often occurs as one of the first manifestations or within 6 months of T1DM diagnosis.",

            "text": "Our aim is to describe two cases of adolescents with a recent diagnosis of type-1 diabetes mellitus that were diagnosed with a complication of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Case 1 A case of an 18-year-old girl, with complaints of reduced visual acuity in both eyes, about one year after T1DM diagnosis, under intensive insulin therapy and excellent glycaemic control (HbA 1C 6.1%). After ophthalmological examination, she was found to have bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC), that were not present at the time of a routine diabetic eye screening at diagnosis. The patient underwent cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation with improved visual acuity. Case 2 A case of a 17-year-old girl who complained of blurry vision six months after T1DM diagnosis, during an ophthalmological screening. Good metabolic control of diabetes was observed during this time (HbA 1C 6.7%). The patient had a unilateral PSC of the left eye. About one year after the first diagnosis she developed PSC of the right eye. She underwent cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation with improved visual acuity. Conclusion: Type-1 diabetic cataracts have been found to have a female preponderance, while the pathogenesis remains unclear, it seems to be related to poor metabolic control or long history of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In these cases, good metabolic control did not appear to prevent cataract formation. Visual impairment occurring early in T1DM in pediatric age should raise a suspicion of cataracts and ophthalmologic evaluation should be prompt. Close monitoring of the fundi for retinopathy following cataract surgery is essential, as proliferative retinopathy may develop rapidly after the surgery. Background: Neurological symptoms can have multiple causes, such as structural changes of the central or peripheral nervous system as well as metabolic, hydroelectrolytic or even psychiatric disorders. Objectives / Methods / Results: A 12-years-old adolescent presented at emergency service (ES) with acute onset of blurred vision, drowsiness, headache and speech difficulties. He was tachycardic but normotensive, emaciated, with slurred speech and dry mouth and objective weight loss of 22% in a week. Blood test revealed hyperglycemia (glucose 1763mg/dL), moderate metabolic acidosis (pH 7.169, HCO3 -12.1mmol/L), high blood ketone levels (ketone bodies 7mmol/L), acute renal failure (creatinine 2.3mg/ dL, urea 108mg/dL) and sodium level 135mmol/L (corrected sodium 161). Head computed tomography without cerebral edema or structural changes. Based on results it was made the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Retrospectively, patient`s mother reported polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia with several weeks of evolution, and recent pollakiuria that motivated a previous visit to the ES. Fluid therapy and intravenous perfusion of insulin was started. Careful and frequent adjustments were needed, nevertheless he developed important hypernatremia (corrected sodium 175 mmol/L). Progressively, he presented improvement in glycemia, ketoacidosis, renal function and dehydration, with disappearance of neurological symptoms. Subsequent study with decreased C-peptide and insulin, increased GAD65 and anti-insulin antibody, and normal levels of anti-zinc transporter protein 8 autoantibodies, thyroid function and lipid profile. At discharge he had no analytic changes. Weight gain of 21%, with no other changes at physical examination. Conclusion: The elevated glycemia and the consequent hydroelectrolytic disorders following the treatment constituted a challenge. It was important to control the rapid rise in hypernatremia to avoid serious consequences as brain shrinkage, intracerebral hemorrhage and demyelination. This case also alert to the importance to a earlier diagnosis of T1DM and to some less frequent and even confounder symptoms in an inaugural episode. Clinical case: We present the case of a 16 years old female, admitted at the emergency department with asthenia, weight loss and daily vomiting with a month evolution. In admission, she presented cutaneous hyperpigmentation, without dehydration signs. Laboratory results showed hyponatremia with hyperkalemia and hypochloremia, decreased cortisol levels with increased levels of corticotropin and increased levels of renin with decreased aldosterone levels. She started treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone with favorable response. Additional investigation evidenced a positive family history for autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency in a sibling.",

            "text": "Discussion: This case is illustrative of an uncommon disease, whose diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion. The presence of cutaneous hyperpigmentation in a patient with constitutional symptoms and vomiting was the key to the diagnosis, as well as the presence of hyponatremia with hyperkalemia. The family history, although uncommon in this disease, was also a clue to the diagnosis. Background: The \"Newcastle work-up\" is laboratory investigation to elucidate metabolic or endocrine causes of hypoglycaemia. One of the tests it measures is growth hormone GH,which should increase during hypoglycaemia. In our recent clinical experience, GH levels have been sub-optimal during hypoglycaemia. The cut off value for growth hormone levels is 7mcg/L,reading below is deemed suboptimal and warrant clinician to investigate further. Aims/Objectives: To identify if the pre-set cut-off value for GH during hypoglycaemia during Newcastle work-up is appropriate and likely or not to identify GH deficiency. The study population was all paediatric patients attending the Paediatrics Department UHL with GH levels over 12 months from January to December 2018, inclusive. Methods: Retrospective review from a prospectively collected database of glucose and GH,including growth velocity, centiles, mid-parental height ranges and IGF-1 during hypoglycaemia in the Newcastle work-up. GH levels were subdivided into five subgroups: 1; 1-2.9; 3-4.9; 5-6.9; 7 mcg/L. Results: Forty Newcastle work-ups were performed on N=40 patients during the study period;GH results according to 5 subgroups are shown in Figure 1 . N=3/39 (8%) GH levels were 7 mcg/L, which is the pre-defined normal range result. The mean GH was 3.83 and median GH 3.19 mcg/ L.IGF-1 level was available on 12/40; 11/40 were normal. N=1/40 IGF-1 was low and this patient had decelerating height centile, GHST was subsequently normal.N=19/40 patients had normal growth velocity and growth centiles,Data on remaining patients are incomplete or pending.GHST was performed on 3/40 children.All had normal GHST results. Conclusion: Women presenting with signs and symptoms of androgen excess should be investigated about NCAH. The majority of NCAH can be associated with three distinct enzyme defects: defects of 21-hydroxylase, 11\u03b2-hydroxylase and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The first one is the most common. This case emphasizes the importance of making the differential diagnosis of hirsutism with interdisciplinary follow-up in patients with hormonal diseases. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis of cortisol, mineralocorticoids or androgens. Its incidence is 1:18000 and the most common type is 21hydroxylase deficiency. Classic CAH can result in a salt-losing form or a simple virilizing form.",

Pregnancy without intercurrences. Elective caesarean section at 38 weeks, Apgar score 6/9/10 and a low birth weight (2335g). He was lethargic and pale, with a 9% weight loss. Urinalysis with 25 leukocytes, hyponatremia (120mmol/L), hyperkalaemia (9.4mmol/L) with electrocardiographic changes and hypoglycaemia (25mg/dL). He was admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit level II, initiating intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin and cefotaxime), bicarbonate, hydrocortisone and ionexchange resins. Uroculture was positive for Escherichia coli. Investigation revealed high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (566pg/mL), cortisol (28.8mcg/dL) and 17-OHP (241.9ng/mL), confirming the diagnosis of CAH. Fludrocortisone (0.3mg/day) was started. Progressive weaning of intravenous corticosteroid and passage to the oral route according to guidelines, with successive relapses and ionic imbalances. By the 34 th day, clinical and analytical stabilization was achieved under hydrocortisone 61,4mg/m2, NaCl 6,2meq/kg/h and fludrocortisone, and was discharged home. At present, he remains stable, without adrenal crisis and reducing hydrocortisone (22,7mg/m2). The genetic study is underway. CAH is a serious condition at risk of impending decompensation. Clinical severity and stabilization are related to the initial enzymatic deficit, so corticosteroid doses and the weaning rhythm should be individualized and the patient monitored closely. CAH has non-specific clinical manifestations in newborns, so a high suspicion index is needed facing a presentation before the third week of life with no virilization signs, as in this case, whose severity and precocity were triggered by an infectious event. Background: Pseudohypoparathyroidism(PHP) represents a group of disorders whose main feature consists in a resistance to Parathormone(PTH) action. The most common subtype of PHP is Ia, caused by a mutation in the GNAS1 gene. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but, because of paternal gene imprinting, different phenotypes occur depending on the origin of the mutated gene. When paternally inherited, subjects only manifest the physical syndrome -Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy (obesity, rounded face, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications\u2026). When maternally inherited, in addition to those physical characteristics, multiple hormone resistance (PTH, Thyroidstimulating Hormone(TSH), gonadotropin\u2026) occurs -PHP-Ia.",

Respiratory symptoms resolved gradually. Because of the family history, at day 6, thyroid hormone testing was requested, showing a free-T4 level of 0.67mg/dL and a TSH concentration of 13.02 IU/mL. Hypothyroidism/TSH insensitivity was diagnosedlevothyroxine therapy was initiated, and thyroid function levels normalized in the following daysdischarge on the 18th day of life. Genetic testing revealed the newborn carried the same mutation as the mother, confirming the diagnosis of PHP-1A. An ultra-sound showed a normal but relatively small thyroid gland. Phosphocalcium metabolism and thyroid function (under levothyroxine) remain normal at 3-month follow-up. Conclusion: While PTH resistance is the main feature of PHP-Ia, TSH resistance may become apparent before hypocalcemia develops, and may be indistinguishable from primary hypothyroidism. Early treatment and continuous monitoring of these patients' hypothyroidism is paramount in preventing future complications. Introduction: Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) is an eating disorder describing patients with obsession for healthy food, in contrast to patients with anorexia and bulimia who worry about its quantity. ON may lead to a state of starvation due to strict diets and shortage of essential nutrients leading to various medical complications as seen in anorexia. To-date, only anecdotal cases on ON in adults were reported. We report for the first time a baby with episodes of apathy and severe ketoacidosis. History of the baby`s and his mother`s nutrition led us to suspect ON in the mother causing his critical condition. Case report: A 17-months-old baby presented with few days history of lethargy and refusal to eat after an attempt of weaning breastfeeding. He had been mainly breastfed and rarely consumed solid food. A detailed dietary history revealed that the mother ate only vegan diet during nursing and provided her baby a strict \"vegan, healthy uncooked diet omitting animal products and fortified babys`formulas\". The baby was lethargic, pale, hyperpneic, had hypotoia with hyperrexflexia. His growth centiles were below the 3 rd percentile. He could not role over nor sit unassisted. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia and severe ketoacidosis. Clinical and biochemical features suggested an inborn error of metabolism (IEM). Urinary organic acids revealed severe ketoacidosis and methylmalonic aciduria. Slow refeeding program including multiple vitamins and vitamin-B12 resulted in resolution of all abnormalities. Conclusion: We describe for the first time ON in a mother causing life-threatening disorder in her child. We designate this condition as \"Maternal ON\" similar to the notion of \"Maternal phenylketonuria\" (PKU) wherein high phenylalanine levels in a PKU mother who does not keep restricted diet, harms her offspring. Pediatricians and dieticians should be aware to Maternal ON mimicking IEM presenting as growth and development delay and/or severe metabolic abnormalities. Case report: A previously healthy 12-year-old male child presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of acute onset of malaise, weakness, anorexia and 2 episodes of lypotimia followed by 3 melena stools.There was no fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting or sore throat.He reported no NSAID, drugs or alcohol history. Physical examination revealed a pale face, afebrile with tachypnea and tachycardia.There was no skin rash, jaundice,lymphadenopathy and the abdomen was soft with no rebound tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.

Gastric biopsy showed lymphoid aggregates without Helicobacter pylori infection. Serologic testing demonstrated a positive IgG and IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen and IgG-antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen 1.Serology for cytomegalovirus,herpes simplex and parvovirus B19 were negative. The present case illustrates the broad spectrum of EBV disease and that it should be regarded as a cause of gastrointestinal lesions. Introduction: Paediatric inflammatory bowel disease is often more aggressive compared to adults and the current tendency is early use of monoclonal antibodies in severe cases, loss of response being the therapeutic challenge. We present the case of a teenager with Crohn`s Disease, naive to anti-TNF therapy who developed antibodies to Adalimumab and was switched to Infliximab. Case Presentation: A 13 years old teenager was admitted for alopecia areata, nummular eczema, abdominal pain and weight loss (17 kg) lasting for three months. His mother reported repeated episodes of diarrhea but he denied. He was diagnosed with Crohn`s Disease and Pediatric Crohn`s Disease Activity Index score was 60, reflecting a severe disease activity. He was started on exclusive enteral nutrition as induction therapy with a good response. We decided to introduce azathioprine not steroids(CS) based on his reluctance to receive CS due to adverse effects. After six months he presented bloody stools and after nine months he developed anal abscess and perianal fistulae which required surgical intervention. Anti-TNF agent Adalimumab was introduced in the treatment plan. After the first 3 months, the seric level of Adalimumab was low and he developed antibodies to Adalimumab accompanying symptoms. We stopped Adalimumab and initiated treatment with Infliximab which he has been receiving for 20 months now with two relapses addressed by dose increase and rhythm adjustment.",

A loss of response to Infliximab may affect the response to subsequent Adalimumab treatment based on cross-reactivity of antibodies even though the two drugs are different idiothypes. However, there is a general lack of experience on the use of Infliximab after Adalimumab failure. In Crohn`s Disease treatment strategy, Infliximab might be a solution after Adalimumab loss of response due to Adalimumab antibodies development. Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten. Classic diagnosis is based on positive tissue transglutaminase type 2 (TTG2) antibodies and histopathological features as villi atrophy. Seronegative celiac patients are very rare in Pediatrics. We describe a unique case of celiac disease in a seronegative adolescent. Case Report: A 15-year-old girl diagnosed with Blackfan-Diamond anemia at birth was referred to a Pediatric Gastroenterologist due to abdominal pain that started two months prior. She was on immunosuppressive therapy with systemic corticosteroids due to her hematological disease up to three months prior. The pain was more intense in the right upper quadrant and the diagnosis of primary biliary dyskinesia was proposed. Celiac screening workup (TTG2, Gliadin and endomisium antibodies) was negative. During an intense pain episode she was admitted to hospital and underwent an upper endoscopy which showed no relevant features. Gastric and duodenal samples were taken and microscopical examination showed moderate villi atrophy with intraepithelial lymphocytosis corresponding to a grade 3b in the modified Marsh classification (Marsh-Oberhuber). Clinical remission was achieved after a gluten-free diet (GFD). One year after diagnosis duodenal/bulb biopsy was repeated showing marked improvement without villi atrophy or crypt hyperplasia but with some intraepithelial lymphocytes (less than 30 per 100 enterocytes) which corresponds to a grade 0/1 in the modified Marsh classification (Marsh-Oberhuber). She remains clinically well on a GFD. Conclusions: CD antibodies are not detectable in the blood of all patients with DC, especially in those under systemic immunosuppression. Strong clinical suspicion should always lead to further investigation with histolopathological analysis even in cases with negative serology.",

Discussions: Cholelithiasis is being recognized in the children with increasing frequency. In children, there may be any number of possible etiologies for the development of gallstones. In the majority, specific etiologic factor is never established. In our case, we suppose the overweight is directly implicated in the produce of gallstones.

Results: 61 children were hospitalized in malnutrition sector, 16.4% with wasting and 83.6% with both stunting and wasting, which was severe in 78.7%, predominantly marasmus (55.7%). The median age was 17 (IQR 11-25) months, 50.8% were male. The majority of mothers breastfed their children (94.7%) for a mean of 12\u00b17 months. Half of parents only spoke Emakhuwa (local language), the majority (53.1%) were Muslim, unemployment in both parents was present in 45.9% and 34.4% reported past use of Mozambican witchdoctors. The majority had neither piped water supply (80.3%) nor electricity (72.1%). They reported a median of 3 meals each day, based predominantly on roots. The most frequent associated conditions were anemia (96.4%), AIDS (31.1%) and malaria (26.2%). There was an association between AIDS and stunting (p=0.023). Severe malnutrition was associated with younger age (p=0.008) and less consumption of fruit and vegetables with marasmus (p=0.004 and p=0.032, respectively).

During workup, an abdominal ultrasound (US) revealed two gallstones with 4 mm of diameter without dilation of the biliary tract. She remained in follow-up, asymptomatic, no physical findings and stable US. At the age of ten, a supra-umbilical mass was detected on US, and MRI revealed an umbilical intra-peritoneal tumor (45x40x45mm) with well-defined limits, heterogeneous, predominantly solid, highly vascularized, and compressing inferior vena cava without local invasion. Surgical mass resection was performed, and histology revealed morphological and immunohistochemical aspects of a PEComa of the abdominal wall. Given the size of the lesion ( 5 cm) and admitting uncertain malignant potential, she was referred to the pediatric oncology center and submitted to margin enlargement. Three years later, she remains asymptomatic without clinical or imagiological evidence of relapse. Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal tumor with myomelanocytic differentiation. It mainly occurs in middle aged females and can be found at any location, being kidney the most common. The differential diagnosis of PEComas is fairly broad but the immunohistochemical coexpression of melanocytic (HMB45) and smooth muscle (actin and desmin) biomarkers make the diagnosis. They may behave indolently but entail variable malignant potential. When there isn't evidence of metastasis, surgical resection is the recommended approach. The benefits of chemotherapy or radiation haven't been established thus far but some clinical reports show good results with mTOR inhibitors. With this case we intend to recall the importance of considering this rare etiology in the evaluation of a mesenchymal tumor and enhance the importance of immunohistochemical biomarkers for the definitive diagnosis. The correct histological classification is essential to assess the potential of malignancy and thus assure the most appropriate therapeutic approach.

Introduction: Rectal bleeding is a common problem in pediatrics and in the majority of cases the causes are transient, benign and simplytreated. The age of onset relates to certain diagnoses: anal fissures and intussusception in infant, and lymphoid hyperplasia and inflammatory bowel disease in the older child. In children younger than 2 years of age we also have to think in Meckel`s diverticulum (MD). In these cases the majority of patients don't have symptoms, but the ones who are symptomatic, often present rectal bleeding, which is usually painless. Case Report: A 12 year-old-boy was admitted to the paediatric emergency room with a 3-day history of abdominal pain with rectal bleeding. No relevant personal or family history. On examination, he presented a BMI 95 th percentile, he was pale, but was hemodynamically stable, with no pain on abdominal palpation. The hemogram showed an hemoglobin of 7 g/dL, so he received a blood transfusion and was admitted to the ward. Throughout his stay he did an upper and lower endoscopy and an MR enterography, which didn't reveal any alteration. We were suspicious of an MD and after having done a technetium-99m pertechnetate scan, the diagnosis was confirmed. He underwent surgical resection of the MD (segmental intestinal enterectomy), which ran without intercurrences. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged on day 6, clinically well. Conclusion: Meckel`s diverticulum is a common congenital gastrointestinal malformation in children but is rare in teenagers. It has various clinical presentations and it is necessary to maintain a high suspicion in the paediatric age group. Serious complications rarely happen but when they do, they can cause consequences, such as mechanical obstruction, intestinal perforation and shock. Thus, prompt diagnosis and proper treatment are essential in warranting a better outcome.

Thoraco-lumbar X-ray of the spine didn't reveal any anomalies. Echocardiography described large pulmonary stenosis. Barium enema failed to pass meconium, exploratory laparotomy was performed for deobstruction. Cystic fibrosis was excluded. Alagille syndrome was the main diagnostic considered, but liver biopsy failed to reveal paucity of the bile ducts. Over the next two years the pacient underwent extensive investigations. A posterior embryotoxon was described.",

The patient was being investigated for loss of appetite, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and bloody stools. The onset was 5 months prior to the diagnosis with bloody stools. Infectious causes were considered and the patient was treated accordingly. She had recurrent fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed severe anemia, high transaminases, cholestasis, high inflammatory markers, hypergammaglobulinemia (50,8 g/dl) and high fecal calprotectine (1370 mcg/g). Viral causes of liver cytolysis were excluded. Due to the persistence of liver cytolysis further investigations were performed and LKM1 antibodies were positive. At the time of the diagnosis the child was completely nonimmunized. Subsequently she received first doses of all mandatory vaccines but no following doses. The colonoscopy showed rectal mucosa with hyperemic patches, histopathological examination being consistent with ulcerative colitis. The liver biopsy displayed advanced hepatic fibrosis and cholangitis. Thus, correlating all data, the diagnostic of an overlap syndrome (autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerotic cholangitis) associated with ulcerative colitis was established.",

Clinical Case: A 2-month-old male patient was operated on for a cervical teratoma. Subsequently, he presented weakness of the oropharyngeal musculature and difficulties in swallowing as well as severe gastroesophageal reflux. He was under omeprazole, domperidone and continuous debit nutrition through a transpyloric tube. Despite the treatment, the patient was presenting frequent regurgitation and vomiting and a chest-abdomen xray was perfomed to check the correct position of the probe. The radiography showed a distended stomach with increased peristaltic activity and he was diagnosed of HPS ( Figure 1 ). The diagnosis was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound (figure 2) and a submucosal pyloromyotomy was perfomed with successful evolution. Our patient was diagnosed incidentally by simple radiography of the abdomen by the \"caterpillar sign\".

Up to 30% of children suffer with constipation, lasting longer than 6 months in 5%. This constipation clinic was set up to provide specialist constipation management with the aim of treating and discharging all children within 2 years. However a significant number of patients are difficult to manage and remain in the clinic beyond 2 years. Objective: The aim of this service evaluation was to analyse the characteristics of these children for common features that would allow early identification of potentially difficult cases. Additionally, their management within the clinic was evaluated to see if any improvements would aid more rapid treatment and earlier discharge. Methods: A search was conducted for patients who had been in the paediatric outpatient constipation clinic for greater than 2 years. Their medical notes were reviewed to identify any features of this population and their management in the clinic that could lead to their ongoing difficulties with constipation.",

Furthermore they had a significant number of changes to their management (many had over 15 medication changes) in clinic, making compliance more difficult. Conclusion: Recommendations were made for changes to management including giving the patients constipation management plans to aid patient compliance with medication and SOS appointments for those stable on therapy who may relapse. It is clear that this particular subset of paediatric patients with constipation have ongoing difficulties despite intensive outpatient management and, as they would benefit from more individualised therapy, our ongoing work involves developing a risk assessment tool to identify them early.

We performed bone densitometry and examined serum levels of osteocalcin and N-terminal procollagen 1 (P1NP) peptide. Anthropometric data and a history of the disease were evaluated. The disease lasted for an average of 7.5 months, the age of adolescents was 14-16 years. Amenorea lasted 5-12 months, twice primary amenorrhea was present. The weight loss was 5-36 kg. Examination of sex hormones has produced findings that are consistent with central hypogonadism. Estradiol was 6 times below 18.4 pmol / L, LH was 5 times below 0.1 U / l. Densitometric examination yielded below average Z scores, in 4 girls the values were below 2 sigma Z score. The most pronounced changes were in the Z score of the spine (mean -0,879), the mean Z-score of the femoral neck was -0,518, and the TOTAL Z score was -0,66. Both osteocalcin and P1NP values were below average, with two girls achieving osteocalcin less than 2.5 percentile for a given age, and P1NP reached less than 2.5 percentile for a given age in four girls. We will monitor the densitometry for 1 and 2 years after the first examination and compare it with serum osteocalcin and P1NP values and we will try to suggest a treatment scheme for secondary osteoporosis in adolescents with AN.

            "text": "Conclusion: Long-term, robust assessment is needed to clarify the longterm effects of DHA+AA supplementation in toddlerhood for children born preterm. Background: Congenital chloride diarrhea (CLD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The main symptom is osmotic diarrhea with high chloride content due to the mutations in solute carrier family 26 member 3 (SLC26A3) gene encoding the intestinal Cl -/HCO 3 exchanger. In Korea and other East Asian countries, only a couple of cases have been reported. Case report: The patient was born at 34 weeks and 5 days of gestation and had a birthweight of 3.13 kg. He had a history of polyhydramnios and a noticeable dilated fetal bowel loops before birth. On day 1 of birth, the patient exhibited severe abdominal distension, vomiting, and biliary reflux. Because of suspected ileus, surgery was performed, and the surgical findings were ileus caused by Meckel`s diverticulum and consequent band formation. Wedge resection (diverticulum resection) of the ileum was performed, and the patient was discharged from the NICU with reduced symptoms. After discharge, however, he was hospitalized several times with intermittent postoperative abdominal distension and metabolite imbalances. The patient, a 5-month-old male infant, was admitted with repeated vomiting and abdominal distension, accompanied with watery stool confused with urine. We suspected CLD and measured chloride level in stool. Watery stool was collected using a rectal tube, and the chloride level was 137 mEq/L, confirming excessive chloride in watery stool. On genetic testing, we confirmed SLC26A3 gene mutation, and CLD was diagnosed. Discussion: This case report describes an infant who initially underwent surgical treatment for ileus induced by Meckel`s diverticulum and congenital band. Even after surgery, the patient continued to exhibit abdominal distension. The initial suspicion should be made on prenatal ultrasound, and patients with severe abdominal distension and chronic diarrhea should be tested for the possibility of CLD. Stool examination confirmed high-chloride content diarrhea and genetic testing led to a final diagnosis of CLD. ",

Paediatric patients are particularly vulnerable to complications of intravenous fluid therapy. We compare current practice in intravenous fluid prescription in the paediatric general wards at Mater Dei Hospital, Malta, to the standard as stipulated by the NICE guidelines. We show how standards of intravenous fluid prescription and subsequent monitoring by staff falls shorts of NICE guidelines, and make recommendations for improvement. Interventions were made to make staff aware of ongoing issues. A second audit cycle is ongoing. Objectives and study:There is no significant clinical state indicating H.pylori infection in pediatric population.In this study, most common complaints,endoscopic and histopathological findings in children with H.pylori infection were evaluated and their correlation with each other was explicated. Methods:Patients between 3-18 years,applied to the hospital with dyspepsia,epigastric pain,reflux symptoms,anemia and suspected gastrointestinal(GI)bleeding and underwent upper GI endoscopy were enrolled in this study.Gastric antrum and corpus biopsies were performed in all patients during endoscopy for rapid urease test and histopathological examination.Sydney classification was used to evaluate H.pylori intensity,activity of gastritis,chronic inflammation,atrophy and intestinal metaplasia.Demographical properties, complaints,endoscopic findings and Sydney scores of the patients were recorded. Results: A total of 339 patients(183 female)were enrolled in the study.The most common complaints were dyspepsia and epigastric pain.90% of the patients had antral pathology, 78% of which was nodularity.Relation between dyspepsia, epigastric pain and antral nodularity is found to be statistically significant.In histopathological examination, intensity score of H.pylori is found to be increasing with the age.Rapid urease test was positive in 90.2% patients.Relation between rapid urease test and the intensity of H.pylori was statically significant.Relations between detected morphological changes in the antrum and the intensity of H.pylori,activity and chronic inflammation scores were statistically significant.Intestinal metaplasia(IM)and gastric atrophy(GA)was present in 7.1% and 6.2% of the patients respectively.No relation was found between IM or GA with the intensity of H.pylori, endoscopic findings and complaints. Conclusion: The most common complaints of children with H.pylori infection were epigastric pain and dyspepsia.There were significant relations with this complaints,antral morphological changes and with the intensity of H.pylori,and the intensity of H.pylori,increases with age.Since these complaints were related with antral morphological changes and these changes were related with activity of gastritis,chronic inflammation and increased intensity of H.pylori, early eradication can be recommended in these children in order to prevent from long term complications.",

Materials and Methods: In our study, we included 60 adolescents aged 14 to 18 years with morphologically proven duodenitis. We detected HP by PCR in feces. Bacteriological examination of the duodenal contents extracted during endoscopy via the endoscope biopsy channel was performed. The activity of enzymes in duodenal biopsy specimens was determined according to the method of A.M. Ugolev and N.M. Timofeev. Results: It was revealed that helicobacteriosis without syndrome of intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) did not affect the activity of the brush border enzymes. In case of combination of helicobacteriosis and SIB\u041e we found it negative correlation with the activity of lactase (r = -0.489, p 0.05) and aminopeptidase M (r = -0.487, p 0.05). Combination of helicobacteriosis and giardiasis had a negative correlation with the activity of lactase (r = -0.33, p 0.05) and glycyl-L-leucine dippeptidase (r = -0.324, p 0.05), whereas the combination of helicobacteriosis with SIB\u041e and giardiasis reduced the activity of all three enzymes: lactase (r = -0.432, p 0.05), aminopeptidase M (r = -0.461, p 0.05) and glycyl-L-leucine dippeptidase (r = -0.374, p 0.05). We have identified microorganisms that have a negative effect on the lactase activity: Actinomyces (r = -0.318, p 0.05), Staphylococcus species (r =-0.416, p 0.05), Pseudomonas aeriginosa (r =-0.435, p 0.05) Peptococcus species (r =-0.455, p 0.05), Candida albicans (r =-0.346, p 0.05), Enterococcus faecalis (r = -0.426, p 0.05). We found a positive correlation between the presence of lactobacilli in the small intestine and the activity of aminopeptidase M (r = 0.341, p 0.05). Conclusions: The microbiocenosis of the duodenum in adolescents with HP-associated duodenitis affects the activity of the brush border enzymes.

            "text": "Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of admissions for battery ingestion requiring endoscopic removal in a pediatric emergency department of a tertiary hospital (January 2009/December 2018). Results: 29 cases, with an increasing number in the last four years (2018: 9 cases). Median age 26 months (8 months-9 years), 52% male. Witnessed ingestion in 24 (83%) patients; 16 (41%) patients were symptomatic, vomiting (21%) was the most frequent symptom. On the X-ray, 8/29 patients (28%) had an esophageal battery (EB) and 21/29 (72%) had a gastric battery (GB). The upper endoscopy revealed the battery (100% button lithium batteries) located in the esophagus (8), stomach (15), duodenum (1) or was not detected (5); median time until removal of EB was 21 hours (6h-21 days). All patients with EB presented with lesions of different severity: erosion (8), ulceration (6), necrosis (5) and perforation (2); 3 patients presented more than one lesion. Of all the cases of GB only a minor erosion was described. There were no cases of mortality reported. Patients with EB had a more complicated clinical evolution, with prolonged hospital stay than GB [median 26 days (6days-80days) vs 14 hours (8hours-6days)] and prolonged follow-up [median 3 months (1month-8year)] vs 1.25 month (1month-1.5month)]; 2/8 (25%) had severe stricture after ingestion and are currently in endoscopic dilation program; one of them is being fed by gastrostomy. Discussion: There has been an increasing number of battery ingestion in recent years. Esophageal batteries remain responsible for persistent severe lesions, mostly in patients with late removal. This study emphasizes the importance of primary prevention. Background: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are important for the maturation of the developing nervous system. As fetal fatty acids originate from maternal stores, the fetal as well as the neonatal supply are determined by the maternal fatty acids. Objective: To systematically review available data on fatty acid composition of plasma and erythrocyte membrane lipids in expecting women during pregnancy and at delivery. Methods: We performed electronic literature search in July 2017 on Cochrane Library, Embase, and Ovid Medline with a search strategy including the following search expressions: (pregnant* OR gestation* OR deliver*) AND (arachidonic OR docosahexaenoic) NOT animal. We analysed data from clinical trials investigating fatty acid composition of plasma or erythrocyte membrane lipids in healthy expecting women without any fatty acid supplementation during pregnancy. Statistical analysis of fatty acid data was performed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v3.0 Software. Results: After excluding duplicates there were 3351 potentially relevant articles. We excluded 3155 articles because they didn't meet our inclusion criteria. 196 relevant articles remained that published fatty acid data of plasma or erythrocyte membrane lipids, from them 19 articles published data of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids. Only 7-9 studies investigated the fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids during pregnancy, while at delivery there were 13 articles publishing fatty acid data. Values of arachidonic acid remained quite stable in the course of pregnancy as well as at delivery. In contrast, values of docosahexaenoic acid were significantly lower during the 1 st trimester than in later timepoints and then it remained quite stable ( Background: Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy that occurs following the ingestion of a triggering food. Symptoms include incoercible vomiting and diarrhea 1-4 hours post exposure, and in severe cases dehydration and shock. This rare condition usually presents in infants younger than 9 months, with cow's milk protein (CMP) as the main trigger. Breastfed infants seem to be protected against CMP-FPIES, although a few cases have been reported with exclusive breastfeeding. Diagnosis is clinical relying on a high suspicion. Clinical Case: A 2-month-old girl exclusively breastfed (except for single bottle of regular formula at day-1) was admitted with intermittent bloody and mucous diarrhea, significant weight loss and dehydration. Laboratory findings showed hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytosis, mild hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. Breastmilk was replaced by a semi-elemental formula (SEF), with clinical improvement. Once breastmilk was reintroduced the symptoms recurred. The infant was kept on a CMP free diet with regular growth and no gastrointestinal symptoms. A first oral food challenge (OFC) to CMP was performed around 9 months and was positive. Last OFC at 36 months remained positive. Diagnosis of FPIES caused by CMP passed through breastmilk was established. Currently, at age 4, she continues to thrive well under CMP restriction. Discussion: Assessment of FPIES is difficult since it's an exclusion diagnosis. Our case enlightens the importance of considering this condition whenever typical symptoms ensue, even in exclusively breastfed infants. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis are common and may lead to a critical life-threatening situation. Background: For the last 10 years Baby Led Weaning (BLW) has gained popularity as an approach to complementary feeding. It's a hot topic on social media, blogs, parenthood books and forums. Parents keep asking about it in routine appointments. BLW is a feeding approach that advocates bypassing conventional weaning practices, based in spoon-feeding of pur\u00e9ed food, to presenting whole foods to infants over 6 months. Objective: There are few studies or long-term outcomes, but the number is increasing corroborating the method's popularity and value. The main purpose of this presentation is to clarify the method, either in its strict form or mixed with the conventional approach, showing its pros and cons, with the ultimate goal of making it easier for the pediatricians to answer parents`questions. Background: There are several causes of abdominal distension, elongation and dilatation of the colon (dolichomegacolon) is a rare diagnosis in pediatric age. It may be congenital or acquired; chronic or acute and may lead to intestinal oclusion and perforation of the intestinal wall, resulting in sepsis and risk of death. Case Report: A 7 month old male child was referred to the paediatric department for abdominal distension, poor weight progression and abundant stools. First child of young non-consanguineous parents (father with esofagogastric reflux) with no hereditary diseases. His birth and psicomotor development were normal. Under exclusive breast milk up to 4.5 months and because of poor weight (15th centil up to 4 months and 3-15th centil since then) starts infant formula. Introduction of gluten at 6 months. Hospitalization for acute gastroenteritis at 3 months. On examination he had a distended abdomen, soft on palpation with tympanism. Blood investigations showed anemia (Hb 10,8g/dL), ferritin 27ng/mL and PCR 0,2mg/dL. Hepatic and renal function, total protein and ionogram had normal values, as well as his immunoglobulin concentrations. Celiac disease, cow`s-milk protein allergy, cystic fibrosis and giardisis were excluded. Upper endoscopy with biopsy (mild degree of esophagitis and gastritis), high resolution manometry, rectoanal inhibitory reflex and sensitivity to rectal distention were normal. Lower gastrointestinal series showed a dolichomegacolon. He was treated with protonpump inhibitor, laxatives, probiotics, high-fiber, lactose-free diet. Conclusion: The dolichomegacolon justifies multiple recurrencies to the emergency room presented with constipation or intestinal suboclusion and has a difficult treatment. Background: Reactive gastropathy is a defensive change in the stomach. In adults, it is caused inter alia by NSAID use and bile reflux. Histological features of reactive gastropathy include foveolar hyperplasia, mucosal congestion and hyperplastic smooth muscle . Reactive gastropathy is associated with various inflammatory conditions. Objective: The authors sought to characterise the association between reactive gastropathy and coeliac disease in children.",

            "text": "Methods: A retrospective chart review on paediatric gastroscopies conducted between 2003-2018 was used. The data was stored in Excel. All patients with coeliac disease or any gastropathy were identified by histopathology. The presence of gastropathy was noted in those with proven coeliac disease. The presence of bile in gastric contents was also recorded as this could act as a potential confounder. Results:1779 gastroscopes were reviewed. 1279 results were available for the histopathological diagnosis of the stomach. 437 had reactive gastropathy, a prevalence of 24%. Of those with reactive gastropathy, 143 had confirmed CD. 842 did not have gastropathy. Of this group, 149 had confirmed coeliac disease. Fisher's exact test showed a significant difference between the results (p0.05). Of the 143 confirmed CD diagnoses within the gastropathy group, there were 81 cases of gastric contents recorded. In 231 cases recorded overall, there was no association between the presence of bile in the stomach and gastropathy. (NS using Fisher's exact test.) Overall 195 of 294 with CD recorded an abnormal gastric biopsy, 3 of them lymphocytic gastritis. 12 of 294 (4%) had eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE). Discussion: Gastropathy of various types is common at endoscopic pathology. Reactive gastropathy, distinct from lymphocytic gastritis, is common in CD in paediatrics, and EoE may also be more common than observed background rates. Bile stained gastric contents did not explain the gastropathy, and reactive gastropathy is not confined to CD patients. Introduction: Caroli disease is rare congenital disorder of the intrahepatic bile ducts. It is characterized by dilatation of intrahepatic biliary tree and with renal cysts. Caroli disease is inherited autosomal dominant. Aim: To present a case of seven months old infant with icterus of the skin and sclera. Material and methods: Seven month old infant with gray-yellow skin color and fatigue for a month. Positive family history of policystic renal disease and carcionama of the liver. At admittion afebrile, pale, yellow sclera. Abdomen above torax. On palpation with hepatosplenomegaly. From examinations: WBC -17,07 CRP= 12.9mg/l. Tot.Bill= 141,5umol/l, Dir. Bill= 93.3umol/l, AST= 142U/L, ALT= 143U/L, ALKP= 790 U/L, LDH= 415U/L, CK=330U/L, CA-19-9 =399,7 U/ml. Abdominal ultrasound showed more cystic formations in the liver that are connected in parts and a larger cyst in the hepatoiduodenal ligament and the liver hilus. The finding goes in addition to Caroli disease. CT scan of abdomen and MRI cholangiopancreatography showed hepatomegaly, cystic and sacular dilated intra and extrahepatic bile pathways. Both kidneys are without signs of obstruction, but with cortical cysts, right in the upper parts and left in the interpolar region with diameter 15 mm. Mild intestinal distension. Background: Diaphragmatic hernia is not a common disease. The severity of symptoms may vary depending on the size of defect and the organs involved. Objectives: The authors aim to raise the awareness regarding this congenital condition as it may not be clinically obvious for a long time. Methods: We present two cases from the Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Hospital, patients with different types of presentation incidentally diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia after the age of three. Results: Case 1: 8 year old boy presented with jaundice. The blood tests revealed elevated levels of total bilirubin, normal liver enzymes. The abdominal ultrasound described a liver mass, possibly a vascular malformation. The patient underwent MRI that excluded this supposition. A thoracic x-ray revealed a right, paracardiac, dome-shaped opacity. The diagnosis was right diaphragmatic hernia with liver thoracic dislocation. Case 2: 3 years 6 months old girl is admitted for persistent cough. An antenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the aortic arch had been set. She was born premature, required intensive care during the neonatal period, one diagnosis being right pulmonary hemorrhage. Postnatal ultrasound examination diagnosed venous duct anomaly (hepatic veins draining in the right atrium). She had a good clinical course with normal growth, cardiac and liver functions. The clinical examination was unremarkable. A thoracic x-ray described homogeneous, well-defined opacity in the in the right lower pulmonary lobe. She underwent antibioticotherapy for pneumonia (7 days) with no change of the thoracic image. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed complex malformation of the venous duct (azygos continuation of the inferior vena cava). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated Morgagni's hernia with liver thoracic dislocation. Conclusion: Diaphragmatic hernia is a challenging diagnosis to be made. Although a congenital condition, it may be asymptomatic for a long time and have many different clinical \"faces\" at presentation. Methods: 58 patients with SBS and 44 with GINMDs aged 1 month to 17 years have been treated in the Department of Pediatric Surgery at Russian Children`s Clinical Hospital. We provide a full range of non-transplant options for IF management: home parenteral nutrition (HPN) program, autologous intestinal reconstructions (AIR), absorption-enhancing drug therapy etc. The most common complications included: catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CABSI) (33,3 %), invasive Candidemia (20,4 %), Intestinal Failure Associated Liver Disease (IFALD) (4,9 %), metabolic bone disease (24,5 %), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and translocation (11,8 %) , recurrent D-lactic acidosis (5,9 %). Multiple measures are being made to predict and prevent these complications. Thorough training of parents on central line care and PN administration, routine use of antibacterial locks have helped to minimize CABSI. The use of new-generation lipid emulsions and choleretic agents allowed to reduce the number of IFALD. For metabolic bone disease the total serum 25(OH)D level and the level of trace elements are being monitored; parenteral Vitamin D and its active metabolites, biphosphonates and calcium/ phosphorus oral supplements are prescribed in accordance with clinical presentation. A combination of pre-and probiotics with rifaximin is used to manage SIBO and recurrent D-lactic acidosis. Results: SBS patients who underwent AIR revealed a statistically significant dynamics of a decrease in the number of catheter-associated complications, IFALD, invasive Candidemia. In patients with severe GINMDs with recurrent intestinal obstructions we put G-tube and create a T-shaped enteroenteroanastomosis which allows to improve gas evacuation and reduce SIBO. Conclusions: patients with SBS and GINMDs require a multidisciplinary approach. Prediction and prevention of complications improve the quality of life and shows a great economic value. Background: Breastfeeding is an important public health strategy for improving short-term and long-term health consequences of the mothers and their infants. Paternal breastfeeding knowledge and intention may influence the maternal choice of breastfeeding. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine university undergraduate females' and males' knowledge, attitudes and intention toward breastfeeding. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 university students included 300 female and 192 male. A questionnaire with sociodemographic information and validated scales to explore: Exposure to breastfeeding, knowledge about Breastfeeding, Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale, and Infant Feeding Intentions was administered online to the university students. Results: The participants' exposure to breastfeeding was considerably high(89.8%). There was a highly significant positive correlation between sex and the knowledge and attitude scores (r=0.22, r=0.26, P=0.001) where females had more knowledge and positive attitude towards breastfeeding compared to males. Whereas males scored higher on intention scale (P0.001). Furthermore, there was a highly significant positive correlation between knowledge and attitude among the participants (r=0.46, P0.001 ). More than half (57.5% ) of the students agreed that breast milk is the ideal food for babies and that breastfeeding is healthier than formula feeding and would increase mother-infant bonding. However, the majority of the participants reported low intention to breastfeed and that they will only formula feed their babies (75.8%). There was a highly significant inverse association between knowledge scores and intention (r =-0.26, P0.001). Conclusions: Overall, the findings from this study revealed that although both males and female university students had good knowledge and attitude about breastfeeding, their intention to breastfeed was low. This is alarming and necessitates that educational programs should promote breastfeeding in schools and universities in order to increase awareness and knowledge about the short term and long term benefits of breastfeeding Background: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory liver disease, characterized by circulating autoantibodies, increased IgG levels and liver biopsy with parenchymal inflammation. In the absence of early treatment, it may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. The acute clinical presentation with asthenia, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, jaundice and headache, occurs in 50% of patients. Case Report: Previously healthy 11-year-old girl, observed in the emergency department for fever (temperature 38.6\u00b0C, every 6 hours), cough, rhinorrhea, frontal headache, weariness and anorexia for 8 days. No relevant personal, family or medical history. No history of recent infections. She had subicteric sclerotics, with no other relevant findings. Blood tests showed mild elevation of inflamatory parameters (WBC'S 13.160 U/L; N 75.3%; CRP 1.1 mg/dL), cytolysis (AST 433 UI, ALT 708 UI), without cholestasis (FA 264 UI, GGT 82 U/L, Total Brb 1.97mg/dL , Direct brb 0.95 mg/dL), LDH 288 U/L and normal tests for clottig time. Chest x-ray was normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis of viral hepatitis was presumed. Due to the absence of severity criteria, she was discharged, and reassessed 24 hours later. From the additional investigation performed, the virulogical study was negative, and Wilson's disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficit and hemochromatoses were excluded. Autoimmunity studies showed positive ANA, doubious anti-Dsdna antibodies and positive anti-LKM1 (LC1) antibodies. The patient was transferred to a tertiary Hospital, where underwent liver biopsy, whose result was compatible with autoimmune hepatitis. She started therapy with prednisolone and hyposaline diet, followed by azathioprine, with clinical and analytic improvement. Conclusion: Although a large group of patients present with thypical symptoms, sometimes the ones that bring them to the ER are not the most common. Therefore, the authors intend to demonstrate the importance of a thorough physical examination and high degree of clinical suspicion, for a good diagnostic orientation.",

Several antioxidant nutrients including carotenoids have been described to inversely correlate with asthma. The majority of studies quantify carotenoids in relation to the amount of food intake rather than direct measurement of tissue carotenoids. Objective: The study aims to assess carotenoids intake and skin carotenoids levels in asthmatic children compared to control group. Methods: A cross-sectional school-based study was conducted in 423 schoolchildren, aged 3.5-17.8 years, in one school at Ongkaluck district, a rural region in central Thailand. Asthmatic children were diagnosed accordingly to Health Interview for Asthma Control questionnaire. Skin carotenoids level was measured with Raman spectroscopy. Demographic data were obtained by directly interviewing children and their parents, whereas anthropometric parameters were measured by trained staff. The intakes of carotenoids were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. Pearson chi-squared test and Student's t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous variables between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children, respectively. Correlations between skin carotenoids level and carotenoids intake were measured by Pearson's correlation test. Results: Seventy three children (17.3%) had diagnosed asthma. There were no significant differences in term of anthropometric parameters, dietary intakes of \u03b1-carotene (904 vs 1,159 mcg/week; P=0.65), \u03b2carotene (5,232 vs 5,189 mcg/week; P=0.60), \u03b2-cryptoxanthin (1,028 vs 1,045 mcg/week; P=0.39), lycopene (4,417 vs 4,951 mcg/week; P=0.54), lutein and zeaxanthin (6,077 vs 6,098 mcg/week; P=0.54) between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. The mean skin carotenoids level was 12,295.6 RU in asthmatic children and 12,529.6 RU in control group (P=0.95). Skin carotenoids level significantly positive correlated with all carotenoids intake in a mild to moderate degrees (r= 0.20-0.42, P0.05). Conclusions: Carotenoids intakes and skin carotenoids levels were not associated with of the risk of asthma in Thai children. Skin carotenoids correlated with all carotenoids intake in a mild to moderate degrees. Raman spectroscopy was a useful tool to determine skin carotenoids level.",

Serum zinc levels increased from baseline to the end of study: the mean gain was 26.4 mg/dL (95%CI: 13.6 to 39.1 mg/dL) in the supplementation group and 14.4 mg/dL (95%CI: 7.4 to 21.3 mg/dL) in placebo group. Mean time of defervescence was not significant different between groups (29.2\u00b124.0 and 38.1\u00b131.5 hours; P-value=0.270). Hospital staying was shorter for children with zinc supplementation than for those with placebo (mean difference 22.2 hours, 95%CI: 5.5 to 38.5 hours; P-value= 0.010). No signs of severe DVI were observed in both groups. Zinc supplementation was well tolerated. Conclusion: Overcoming zinc deficiency among Thai children may reduce DF duration and limit the hospitalization, in addition to other advantages that normal serum zinc levels have on overall children health. Background: There are a lot of studies dedicated to anorexia nervosa in teens, but its general frequency isn't so high. Still, adolescents are risk group for development of imbalanced diet as well as body dysmorphic disorders and low body-esteem. However, nutritional pattern and bodyesteem in adolescents aren't so well established. The Aim: to evaluate dietary habits and body self-esteem in adolescents. Material and Methods: 36 own design questionnaires, filled in by adolescents by their own. The questioner includes 3 blocks of questions: own evaluation of body composition and weight, dietary habits and adherence to a specific diet. Results: After analyzing of data we received following results from 53%(19) boys and 47%(17) girls with mean age 14.75\u00b10.46 years. There were 10.8%(3) adolescents with underweight, 7.2%(2) with overweight and 82%(31) with normal weight. However, all children with underweight considered their weight as normal, 25%(9) teens with normal weight count their weight as an overweight, but not as obesity. The 83%(30) of children evaluated body weight of parents as normal. Parents prepared food to all respondents. The 58%(21) teens consumed food 3-4 times, 25%(9) 2 times and 8%(3) 1 time daily. Consuming food without hunger was noted by 58%(21) of adolescents and eating in front of a TV was found in 75% (27) cases. There were 66.7%(24) ordered fast food at least 1 time weekly, 92%(33) drank soda or sweet beverages daily. However, 92%(33) and 83%(30) of children ate fruits and vegetables respectively every day. There were 18(50%) teens, which follow hypocaloric diet on purpose of weight reduction. We did not have respondents practiced vegetarian or vegan, or other specific diet. Conclusions: survey showed features of misinterpretation of own weight and body composure, simultaneously with suboptimal dietary habits and adherence to hypocaloric diet in adolescents. ",

            "text": "Background: Acute gastroenteritis is the sudden onset of diarrhoea with passage of 3 or more loose stools in a 24 hour period, or the passage of 1 or more bloody stools in the presence or absence of abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting. Acute gastroenteritis is self-limiting lasting 2 weeks or less, however, it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current primary treatment is restoration of the acid-base balance, correction of electrolyte disturbances, and oral rehydration. The treatment helps to decrease morbidity and mortality, however, it seldom impacts the duration and symptoms of the infection. Probiotics may help reduce both the duration and severity of symptoms of gastroenteritis, however strain specific efficacy and inter-strain comparison has yet to be established. Objective: This systematic review examines original research and the different strains of probiotics used to determine the efficacy of probiotics in treating acute gastroenteritis in the paediatric population. Methods: An Embase search was carried out and the articles were screend by two reviewers. All reviewer conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Data was extracted from the included articles to determine correlation and effects of probiotics. Results: 581 results obtained from the search. 11 studies were included for data extraction after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Majority of the studies showed probiotics reduced duration of diarrhoea (8 of 11 studies), and duration of hospitalisation (6 of 11 studies). 2 papers reported adverse effects, such as fungaemia, in immunocompromised and ICU patients. The different strains of probiotics that were examined in the selected papers include Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Conclusion; Probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea symptoms and hospitalization. Usage of probiotics was however accompanied by minimal side effects but not indicated in immunocompromised patients with gastroenteritis. Further research needs to be conducted to determine the strain specific efficacy and dosage requirements for treatment of gastroenteritis using large scale double blinded RCTs. Background: The last two decades rapidly risen in the incidence and prevalence of childhood-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has demanded many research debates. Both developed and developing countries are facing the burden of early onset IBD, although previously it was considered to be rare in children.",

Methods: We identified children diagnosed with IBD using the database of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Clinical Emergency Hospital, a tertiary unit, from Bucharest, the capital of Romania. Results: The total number of IBD paediatric cases investigated in our Department over a 10 years period is 74. In this interval, 62 patients (20 males/42 females= 0.477) were diagnosed with UC and 12 subjects had CD (7 males/ 5 females=1.4). The sex difference was not significant for neither CD nor UC (p0.05). The median age in years was 11.4\u00b14.83 for IBD, 11.32\u00b14.86 for UC, 11.81\u00b14.87 for CD. The median age at diagnosis did not differ between CD and UC (p\u02c20.005), and evaluation regarding sex showed no significant differences between the age at onset in boys and girls (p\u02c20.005). The mean duration of time between age at first symptoms and diagnosis was 5.02\u00b17.96, 4.96\u00b18.33 and 5.33\u00b16.00 months for IBD, UC and CD respectively. We report 17.6% patients with very early onset IBD, while the previous data from 2004 to 2015 showed 33% being diagnosed before the age of 6. In the last 3 years we identified 40 newly diagnosed IBD cases with mean age at diagnosis of 13.61\u00b13.07 years. Conclusion: Future studies should investigate the epigenetic factors, such as antibiotics use in the first years of life, feeding patterns and infections, among our paediatric IBD cohort, considering its increasing incidence and changing patterns over time.",

Methods: Data on breastfeeding, early feeding patterns, individual anthropometric measurements and social characteristics were collected in a population-based prospective cohort study among 382 children. Of the original sample, only 113 (29.5%) subjects participated in the 5-year follow-up. Results: The distribution according to BMI in terms of underweight, normal weight, overweight/obese children were 11.5% (13), 74.3% (84) and 14.2% (16) respectively, at 12 months old, while the proportions were 3.5% (4), 73.5% (83), and 23% (26) respectively, at the age of 6. The BMI evolution for 1 year underweight children was to normal weight in 76.92% cases and to overweight/obesity in 15.38% subjects, while 1 individual remained underweight. Sixty two per cent (62.5%) of the 1 year obese infants were still obese after 5 years. Univariate predictors of BMI in subjects aged 6 were identified as: 12 months BMI (r=0.36, p=000), duration of breastfeeding (r=-0.45, p=0.000), timing of complementary feeding (r=-0.54, p=0.000), amount of meat during weaning (r=0.63, p=0.000), while living area, family income, maternal age or education had no impact. Conclusion: Timing of introduction of solid foods and breastfeeding duration were associated with child obesity at 6 years in our sample. Since reducing obesity is a difficult task once it appeared, preventing interventions should be implemented in the first years of life. Background : Intestinal invagination usually presents accutely in infants under 2years after gastro-intestinal tract infection, when it occurs in older children or with chronic symptomatology , secondary causes must be ruled out such as polips, tumours or rarely, coeliac disease. Objective: We present here an atypical case of recurrent invagination in a 9 years old girl wih malnutrition. Methods: Clinical report of a case, clinical and laboratory data have been collected. Results: 9 years old girl who lived in Morocco with her mother with low socioeconomic status. She used to have pica, failure to thrive and episodes of acute abdominal pain wih distension and vomits. She had no access to healthcare. She was transfered to emergency department in Spain hospital because of abdominal pain, vomiting and bloody diarrhea with ultrasound diagnosis of invagination. During surgery enlarged intestinal lymph nodes were seen and removed for biopsy and the invagination was reducted. Several malnutrition was noticed, with body mass index , Waterlow and Shukla index very low for his age; she presented with no eyelashes and eyebrows thinning (Picture1). In blood test, iron deficiency, low leves of vitamine A, E, B12, zinc and folic acid were measured, and very high levels of anti-transglutaminase antiboides IgA (128 U/ml). Duodenal biopsy was carried out and resulted in marked atrophy of villi and increased criptes (Marsh IIIb). After gluten-free diet the patient did not have invagination any more and gained weight. Conclusion: Although coeliac disease is well-known and easily diagnosed in developed-countries, atypical and severe manifestations can occur when there is no access to medical services in non-developed countries. Background: Iron deficiency can have several clinical consequences such as anemia or short and long-term developmental delay in children. Iron deficiency anemia is multifactorial. It can occur due to problems of intestinal absorption, including excessive intake of dairy products, which interfere with the absorption of iron from other food. Objective: Remind severe possible drawbacks of excess dairy food in pediatric age. Methods: Report of a clinical case from a suburban hospital in Portugal. Clinical Report: Male, two years and eight months old, ex premature with delayed psychomotor development. Gypsy ethnicity, consanguineous parents, family history of Favism. Artificial milk-based feeding since birth due to poor adaptation to breastfeeding and food diversification since eight months of age. Sent to an appointment due to failure to thrive, with all parameters inferior to percentile three according to WHO curves. Prostration and extremely pale mucosa were observed, being decided hospital admission for investigation. Analytical evaluation: Hemoglobin 4.8g/dl (normal 11,5-13,5g/dl), Hematocrit 20.3% (normal 34-40%), Iron 19ug/dl (normal 60-170 \u03bcg/dl), Ferritin1ng/mL (normal 15-300ng/ml); transferrin saturation 4% (normal 20-50%); Total capacity fixing iron 503ug/dl (normal 250-400 \u03bcg/dl). Peripheral blood with marked microcytosis and hypochromia, elliptocytes and dacryocytes. Abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable. Blood transfusion was performed and iron therapy was initiated with an improvement of all analytical parameters. During hospitalization, health professionals verified continuous intake of milk, instigated by parents, with detriment and refusal of other food by the child. Parents later admitted that infant feeding is milkbased at all meals. Conclusion: Excessive milk ingestion is a common cause of iron deficiency in preschool age children. After six months of age, it is necessary to supply iron with complementary food and limit milk intake. Reinforcing this information and stimulating its practice to parents is extremely important for the prevention of anemia and its consequences in childhood.",

It is important to obtain the array of demographic, co-morbidities, and health outcomes of children with Down Syndrome (DS) in the UAE, Down Syndrome Gulf Registry Methods: After IRB approval, a 3-year retrospective chart review of health data for 178 patients presenting to the DS Clinic were collected and analyzed using SPSS software. Systems-based medical comorbidities associated with Down syndrome and 20 demographic, socio-economic, educational, and maternal age indicators were documented. A Standardized template of their care plan was incorporated into an EHR system using 2011 AAP DS Health supervision guidelines in a UAE Down Syndrome Clinic. The children with DS were enrolled in the DS registry preventative health and complex care coordination was provided. Results: DS in the UAE is starkly 2-2.5 times greater as global incidence of DS. Conclusions: Children with Down syndrome living in the UAE share similar characteristics with other populations. However, there are some interesting differences in both demographics and co-morbidity patterns. High rates of parental consanguinity, no prenatal screening, and increasing maternal age maybe a factor in increased incidence. Genitourinary anomalies occur frequently, as do the other commonly described medical co-morbidities. Similar cardiac malformations occur, but AVC is not the most common. Higher co-morbidity rates and surgical are noted in the DS clinics of a tertiary hospitals. Select cases with severe compromise highlight the need to follow medical guidelines to optimize outcomes. Further development of the registry to improve outcomes in sleep apnea monitoring, obesity, and other long-term progressive conditions needs to occur Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), an inherited connective tissue disorder of remarkable clinical variability, is caused by a quantitative or qualitative defect in collagen synthesis and is characterised by bone fragility.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta was present in 56% and blue or gray sclera was found in 94.5%. All our patients were treated with pamidronate at age-appropriate doses. During the follow-up we found clinical and radiological improvement with a decrease in the fracture rate in all of our patients. Genetic counseling for parents was done. Conclusion: This study suggests that treatment with pamidronate improves mobility in children with moderate to severe osteogenesis imperfecta and decreases the frequency of fractures. Background: Approximately 1 in 17 people is affected by a rare disease in the UK, many of which are genetic in origin. Using DNA sequencing, these and many other conditions will soon be diagnosed antenatally or early in life, having major implications on paediatrics in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Many European governments are investing in Genomic Medicine and paediatricians are well placed to recognise these new opportunities and integrate them into their practice. Objective: In 2017 the Welsh Government introduced the Genomics for Precision Medicine Strategy, aimed at developing genetics and genomics to improve health and healthcare provision in Wales. To help fulfil this strategy, Swansea University launched an MSc in Genomic Medicine in May 2018, the first University in Wales to provide this opportunity to multi-disciplinary health care professionals, imparting the skills and knowledge necessary to interpret genomic data and understand its impact on patient care. Methods: Based on the indicative curriculum of Health Education England and Genomics England, this 2 year part-time Masters course integrates lectures, workshops, tutorials, interactive group learning and guest lectures, while encouraging and facilitating workplace learning. Modules include bioinformatics, genomics of common and rare inherited diseases, ethics, techniques and optional modules such as pharmacogenomics. Module assessments are summative and students must complete a dissertation describing an applied genomics project, research, or literature review. Results: Eight students completed their first year of study in January 2019. A variety of healthcare professionals enrolled (e.g. laboratorybased microbiologists, geneticists, pathologists, oncologists and paediatricians) which fostered collaborative work and learning. The formal and informal feedback to all modules has been excellent, with students ranking all aspects as \"highly satisfactory\". Conclusion: The MSc in Genomic Medicine plays a vital role in educating healthcare professionals seeking knowledge and skills in this emerging discipline.",

The most common features of 49XXXXY syndrome include: learning difficulties, speech difficulties, hypotonia, underdeveloped sex organs and infertility. The diagnosis can be made by karyotyping in cell samples taken from placental tissue by chorionic villus sampling, or from amniocentesis. CGH array is another method for diagnosis of 49XXXXY. Case Summary: T.O. is an 11 months old male infant born at 36+1 weeks`gestation by elective C/S for severe IUGR, prematurity and breech. His mother is a 26 years old Irish lady, and she had no antenatal issues. His birth weight was 2.28kg. He was admitted to NICU after delivery for mild respiratory distress. On examination he was hypotonic and had micropenis. On day of life (DOL) 2 his sodium level was found to be 147, and continued to be raised until DOL 3 with high serum osmolality. He had a cranial USS on DOL 3 which showed several subependymal cysts in the frontal lobe suspicious for a congenital cyst formation. He also had a renal USS which was normal. At 4 weeks of age he had an MRI Brain which showed connatal cysts adjacent to the frontal horns of both lateral ventricles. He was discharged on DOL 16 from the NICU. He had 4 monthly pediatric outpatients follow up as well as physiotherapy follow up. T.O. had recurrent chest infections requiring admission. On his admission at 8 months of age he had genetic and metabolic work up, and a diagnosis of 49XXXXY was reached. An early intervention referral was made for his persistent central/peripheral hypotonia and his developmental delay. Conclusion: Rare diagnosis like 49XXXXY can often be missed or diagnosed late due to lack of specific features. Features such as underdeveloped genitalia and hypotonia should always raise concerns of underlying cause. Pending results of parental lipid screening and genetic study in both patients. In both cases, secondary causes of hypolipemic were excluded. Conclusion: LDL low cholesterol forces you to rule out secondary causes of hypolipemia. FHBL is due to mutations in the gene apoB or with less frequency of PCSK9 although in 50% of the cases does not become affiliated with any mutation. Diagnosis is important to prevent the emergence of homozygous FHBL in future generations, which is associated with degenerative neuromuscular diseases and retinal problems. Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder with an estimated incidence of 1/1000-2500 live births. Owing to multiple organ involvement, a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs may occur in this syndrome as well as a high variable expressivity. We present two cases of NS with different presentations. 4-year-old boy, with prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygroma, pleural effusion and bilateral hydronephrosis. Amniocentesis was performed at 21 weeks for extended genetic and infectious study including Noonan Syndrome and Noonan spectrum mutation panel, which was negative. Admitted at birth due to prematurity of 32 weeks. During hospitalization, craniofacial dysmorphisms (CD) suggestive of NS were observed as well as multiple organ involvement hence he performed genetic study detecting a pathogenic heterozygosity variant c.1391GT (p.G464V) exon 11 in the BRAF gene. He is currently medicated with propanolol for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

            "text": "16-year-old girl, referred to hospital consultation at 3 years of age due to CD. Performed a metabolic study, karyotype, muscle biopsy and mitochondrial DNA study that were normal. Subsequently she abandoned follow-up and was referral again at age 13 due to pubertal delay and short stature. She presented CD, unilateral mammary bud, very scarce pubic hair, pulmonary stenosis, syndactyly, interventricular comunication, pielic ectasia and intellectual disability. NS was suspected and confirmed by the finding of a heterozygosity variant c.4AG(pSer2Gly) in the SHOC2 gene. The severity of NS varies widely, from presentations that are lethal prenatally to mildly affected individuals. Because presentation can be mild and the typical facial features recede with age, the diagnosis might be overlooked, while in severe cases the diagnosis is made sooner and multidisciplinary approach is often needed to address the medical and developmental complications. Background: Stickler syndrome (SS) is a connective tissue disorder affecting the normal collagen production. Majority of cases present an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Clinical presentation is characterized by ocular (myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration and retinal detachment), skeletal (premature osteoarthritis, mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and joint hypermobility) and orofacial findings (midfacial underdevelopment, cleft palate and micro/retrognathia), along with neurosensorial hearing loss. Case Report: A 5-years-old female child was born from a supervised gestation in which a mandibular hypoplasia was suspected in the echography screening of the 2 nd trimester (16 weeks). For this reason, she underwent prenatal testing which showed a normal karyotype (46XX) with no further abnormalities. Her father had a previous diagnosis of SS (molecularly confirmed) displaying ocular and osteoarticular manifestations. More recently a patient's brother was also diagnosed with SS in a prenatal genetic screening. Our patient was born from a full-term pregnancy with an Apgar index of 8/9/10. On examination, she presented a Pierre Robin sequence and conventional mechanical ventilation was needed during the first 72 hours due to airway obstruction. The patient was hospitalized during 24 days for feeding support. At 12 months of age she was submitted to a surgical correction of cleft palate with a favourable clinical outcome. Subsequent ophthalmological examination depicted a high-grade myopia. Taking into consideration the presence of a Pierre Robin sequence, highgrade myopia, joint hypermobility (Beighton score of 8/9) and positive first-degree SS family history, the diagnosis of SS was established and posteriorly confirmed with a genetic study. The patient is currently under a multidisciplinary follow-up including speech therapy and psychology. Conclusion: SS diagnosis is clinically based, encompassing variable phenotypic expressions depending on the inheritance pattern. In the presence of a Pierre Robin sequence a high index of suspicious is needed for the diagnosis of SS, which requires a multidisciplinary management and follow-up. Background: Cri du Chat or cat cry syndrome is a rare disorder resulting from a deletion, of variable size, on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-). The incidence is estimated between 1:15.000 and 1:50.000 live-born infants. Literature data report 10% of mortality, 75% of which occurs within the first year. The most important clinical features are the high-pitched cat-like cry early on life (apparently related to vocal cord abnormalities) as well as low birth weight, microcephaly, round face, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, micrognathia and psychomotor delay and intellectual disability. Moreover, other malformations, although not very frequent, may be present: cardiac, neurological and renal abnormalities. With advancing age, the clinical manifestations could become less striking, making diagnosis more difficult. Clinical Case: A female infant, of 8 months, institutionalized, with unknown parents, present from the birth high-pitched cat-like cry, broad nasal bridge, and microcephaly, being followed in consults of neonatology. According to clinical records, it was a single term pregnancy, with normal evolution and eutotic delivery with Apgar Index 9/10. Given the suspicion of Cri du chat syndrome, a genetic study (FISH) was done that was negative for 5p. Then, the chromosomal array study (aCGH) was performed, which revealed deletion in the terminal region 5p, confirming the possibility of the etiology of the patient`s phenotype. Conclusion: Although there is no specific therapy for this syndrome, this case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis for effective educational and rehabilitation interventions, encouraging the performance of the genetic study, namely the chromosomal array study. Moreover demonstrates that make a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging and thus the valuation of the clinical findings is very important. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent, life limiting, genetic disease in Caucasians, caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The incidence varies in different geographical areas and ethnic groups. The last two decades newborn screening (NBS) for CF has been implemented in the majority of countries where CF is common as a wellestablished public health strategy. Objective: In May 2018, NBS for CF was introduced in R.N.Macedonia as a pilot study (in 13out of 30 maternities), included in National program for mothers and children's care of the Ministry of Health. Methods: Two steps IRT-IRT algorithm were performed, and then a sweat test for confirmation/exclusion of the CF diagnosis when IRT values were both over the cut off. In cases of positive or borderline sweat tests, mutation analysis of CFTR gene were performed (snapshot reaction for 11 most common regional CFTR mutations or extended gene analysis). Results: During the period of 6 months 9332 newborns were screened for CF. For IRT1 the cut-off level of 70 ng/ml was established (99.5th percentile) and for IRT2 a fixed cut off was used at 40ng/ml. Out of 11 screening positive cases, diagnosis of C F w a s c o n f i r m e d i n 5 ( s w e a t t e s t r e s u l t s : 9 0 . 102..101..106..102mmol/L). All diagnosed cases at the end of the first month of life, already had symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of CF. The patient`s genotypes were: F508del/ F508del (3), F508del/G1349D and F508del/G542X. In the same period, two symptomatic cases were diagnosed (mean age of diagnosis 4.5 months), born in maternities where the pilot study was not conducted (genotypes: F508del/R1158X and F508del/ CFTRdel2,3). Conclusion: The pilot study showed a high incidence of CF in our region of 1:1860 live births. From 2019, NBS for CF will be implemented on the whole newborn population in the country, since early diagnosis of CF through NBS and the appropriate preventive and curative care management of affected children has a proven benefits with respect to clinical outcomes and health economics. Background.There is now well documented that environmental agents can modify health by disruption of the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems. During early postnatal life the brain exhibits high plasticity which allows environmental signals to alter the trajectories of rapidly developing circuits. Adversity in early life is able to shape the experience-dependent maturation of stress-regulating pathways such as the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Objective. Present study was performed to make clear the influence of early maternal deprivation on formation the emotional status in later childhood; To understand the effect of early deprivation on the regulatory mechanisms of HPA axis. Methods. The blood neurotransmitters (Norepinephrine NE, Dopamine DA, Serotonin SE) levels were investigated in healthy institutionalized children at age 6 to 36 months from Tbilisi Infant's Orphanage. Emotional status was assessed in institutionalized children at age 3 to 6 years by Leusher's Color Test. Control group formed the same age healthy children from Tbilisi mother-child shelters. Results. Elevation in blood NE and low levels of DA and SE levels were established in the institutionalized infants to compare with control group. The higher was the percentage of children with anxiety and behavioral disorders in the group of orphan children, than in children with family care. Conclusion. In this study early life stress has been shown to be a strong predictor of impaired inhibitory feedback regulation of the HPA axis. Thus we have proposed that conditions of early life environment can evoke changes in DNA methylation facilitating epigenetic programming of critical genes involved in regulating stress responsivity that may in turn manifest with neuroendocrine and behavioral symptoms in later childhood periods. So, it is recommended to support alternative ways of abandoned children`s care against children`s institutions, such as biological mothers' financial support or foster care.",

            "text": "Wolfram Syndrome (WS1) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, hearing loss and neurodegeneration. WS1 may be caused by variants in the WFS1 gene that encodes a protein called wolframin. A 10-year-old boy presented to the emergency department for dysuria, polyuria and polydipsia with four days duration. Recent changes in appetite or weight were denied. He had a history of syncope episodes and progressive vision loss since the age of 7 and was recently diagnosed with bilateral optic nerve atrophy. His physical exam was normal and he had a Tanner stage I. Capillary blood glucose measurement was 388 mg/dL and urine test strip presented glycosuria without ketonuria. His blood pH was 7.38, potassium level was 3.7 mEq/L and bicarbonate level was 27.2 mmol/L. He had a normal lipid profile and thyroid function, negative antithyroid antibodies, negative screening for celiac disease and negative anti-islet cell and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. Considering the combination of optic nerve atrophy and diabetes mellitus, a genetic study for Wolfram Syndrome was performed and revealed 3 variants: 2 of uncertain clinical significance and one probably pathogenic variant. He had a normal tympanogram and audiogram and abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any abnormalities. A multiple dose insulin injection therapy was started and he was referred to diabetes and genetics consultation. WS1 has poor prognosis and currently there is no effective therapy for this syndrome. Regular audiologic evaluation will be essential to early identify hearing loss. Therefore, a timely recognition and diagnosis is essential in order to minimize the complications and reduce morbidity and mortality. Background: Rhabdomyolysis is a muscular necrosis with release of its constituents into the circulation. It can be a manifestation of multiple disorders of different origins. A thorough clinical history and laboratorial investigation, with a high index of suspicion are of paramount importance to an accurate diagnosis. Case: A 6 year old female was admitted to the emergency department (ED) with fever and odynophagia. She had a previous history of intermittent toe-walking and creatine kinase (CK) elevation. A blood test in the ED revealed mild anemia, elevated CK, and serology compatible with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. During follow-up, a past history of myalgia and exercise intolerance was found. The patient also presented gastrocnemius hypertrophy, negative Gowers sign and an otherwise normal neurological examination. Continued elevation of CK was detected, so she did baseline metabolic studies and Pompe disease screening with no alterations. A muscle biopsy revealed glycogen deposits and an absence of myofosforilasis, suggestive of McArdle disease, confirmed by the presence of c.148CT (p.Arg50*) and c.40delA (p.Ile14Serfs*12) variants in PYGM gene. Patient was started on a carbohydrate enriched diet and light to moderate aerobic exercise regimen, and information on rhabdomyolysis was given. A progressive normalization of CK levels and physical activity were observed. Conclusion: McArdle disease, or type V glycogen storage disease is a rare, recessive autossomic pathology caused by a mutation on the PYGM gene, resulting in a myofosforilasis deficiency. Only 4% of the cases are diagnosed before the age of 10. Its clinical presentation and severity is highly variable, ranging from severe hypotony, gait abnormalities, exercise intolerance, myalgia and muscle fatigue. Patients usually present with elevated CK levels and episodic rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria and acute renal failure. This case highlights the importance of investigating rhabdomyolysis' possible etiologies, in order to prevent or allow an early detection of acute decompensations. Background: Down syndrome(DS) is the genetic leading cause of intellectual disability. Its worldwide incidence is 1:700-800 pregnancies, with 10000-12000 estimated cases in Portugal. The main characteristics include physical features, specific medical conditions and neurodevelopmental disorders. Objective and Methods: Retrospective and descriptive study, with the aim of analyzing patients with DS in a Neurodevelopment Unit of a Level III Hospital in 31/01/2019. Results: 29 patients with DS were included, 3(10,3%) with prenatal diagnosis; median maternal age of 29 years; 18(62,1%) male gender, between 1-18 years-old (mean and median 7 years). The first neurodevelopment consultation occurred between 1 month-14 years old. 21(72,4%) patients had cardiopathy, 17(58,6%) endocrine, 16 (55,2%) respiratory, 7(24,1%) gastrointestinal, 2(6,9%) neurologic and 2(6,9%) haematological disorders. Regarding neurodevelopmental assessment, all patients had communication disorders, 5(17,2%) presenting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD) under methylphenidate and 1(3,4%) Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD). Concerning interventions applied, 28(96,6%) attended speech therapy, 25(86,9%) occupational therapy and 9(31,0%) physiotherapy. The adopted strategies were based on the learn to read to learn to talk program, phonomimic method (Teles P, Portugal) and Dolman Method in 2 patients each and Makaton method in 1 patient. In the remaining the intervention method was not specified. 18 patients(62,1%) were schoolers (median 8,5 years), benefitting from inclusive education.Conclusion: This review presents a holistic understanding of DS. In our sample the referral to Neurodevelopmental consultation was late, when it should occur precociously with the remaining specialties. Diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders in DS patients is challenging, since their learning disabilities, maturity delay and the syndrome itself. Therefore, an ASD diagnosis is often late, which worsens the outcome. Besides, most demonstrate attention deficit, restlessness and impulsivity, with ADHD in only 17,2% of our sample. The prognosis is influenced by the onset, type and frequency of the intervention. The ideal method should be multi-modal, flexible and focused on the subject, family and community. The authors report a 15-year-old Caucasian male, with a history of learning/intellectual disability (very low verbal and full-scale IQ (<70)), combined type attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), an unusual happy appearance, overweight, mild tricuspid valve regurgitation and facial pilosity asymmetry. Karyotype XY, 46 and PCR revealed a FMR1 allele of normal size. Through microarray analysis, he was identified with a copy number variation -a 537Kb deletion between BP1 and BP2 on 15q11.2, involving various genes, including CYFIP1, TUBGCP5, NIPA1 and NIPA2. Patients with 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion (termed Burnside-Butler) syndrome, according to recent literature, can present with developmental delay (speech delay, writing and reading difficulties, verbal IQ \u226475) and neurobehavioral abnormalities including ADHD and unusual happy expression; less commonly, patients present mild dysmorphic features and congenital heart defects. These features are present in our patient. However, overweight or obesity have not been directly associated. Specific involvement of facial pilosity or tricuspid valve defects have not been previously described in this emerging cytogenetic syndrome, whose phenotypic features are still in expansion. The authors aim to further the awareness of this etiologic entity, believing that achieving a diagnosis offers a basis on which to delineate the approach both to the patient and to their families, who in this case were oriented to Medical Genetics evaluation. Rationale: Collaborative practice happens when healthcare professionals work together with patients and families to deliver the highest quality of care. This is the optimal model for paediatric care, with children and families included as partners within the healthcare team. Interprofessional education (IPE) is seen as a necessary step towards collaborative practice. We sought to explore how best to prepare our students for paediatric collaborative practice, harnessing the unique interprofessional learning opportunities in paediatric care. This also required navigating logistical IPE challenges such as asynchronous curricula, unequal class sizes and delivery across international campuses. Methods: We collaborated with a parent in creating case-based online IPE. Videos of the parent/child in consultations with a paediatrician, pharmacist, physiotherapist and speech and language therapist were recorded and embedded into an interactive Articulate Storyline\u00ae package. Pre-post MCQs and key teaching points covered a range of issues including developmental stages, medication administration and complex communication.",

Background: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an auditory-pigmentary syndrome caused by absence of melanocytes. Melanin contributes to skin, hair, and eye color and it plays an essential role in the normal function of the inner ear. Based on the phenotypic or genotypic characteristics, WS is clasificated in four types. The prevalence of WS is estimated to be 1/42,000 and it is responsible for 1% to 3% of cases of profound congenital deafness. Objective: Describing a clinical case of WS type I with de novo mutation of PAX3 gene that associates other malformations that are not included in this syndrome. Method: A 2 years old boy with WS type I who associates small ventricular septal defect, epispadias and congenital scoliosis with two hemivertebra. These two last defects are not described in WS clinical features. He has three mayor WS criteria (dystopia cantorum, congenital sensorineural hearing loss, white forelock) and two minor criteria (synofrys and broad and high nasal root with narrow nose), also bilateral blue iris. He has a profound bilateral hearing loss so he wears headphones with bilateral ventilation tubes pending of cochlear implant. Nowadays he is also pending of correction surgery of epispadias. Our patient has a healthy 5 years old brother and parents without WS features. The genetic study of parents was normal so his mutation has arisen de novo in heterozygosis c.667CT (p.Arg222Ter) in PAX3 gene.",

            "text": "Conclusions: All patients with white forelock, hyperthelorism, iris heterocromia or distopia cantorum should be investigated for hearing loss. Patients with any malformation should be widely studied to rule out other associated malformations. The remarkable finding is that this patient associates abnormalities that we have not found associated with WS in the current literature. Backgound: Vitamin-D-dependent rickets 1A (VDDR-1A) is an extremely rare, autosomic recessive genetic form of rickets caused by a defect in vitamin D 1\u03b1-hydroxylase enzyme which leads to low levels of 1,25-(OH) vitamin D. Herein, we report two Moroccan sisters R.E. and N.E. (respectively 3 and 15 months old), born from consanguineous parents, who presented with psychomotor retardation and failure to thrive. Methods: Biochemical analyses in serum and urine were conducted using the automatic analyzer Cobas immediately after collection. Serum intact PTH was measured by chemiluminescence assay. 25-OH vitamin D and 1,25-(OH) vitamin D levels were measured by enzyme immunoassays. The entire coding region of CYP27B1, CYP2R1 and VDR genes were sequenced through NGS technology. Relevant genetic variations were resequenced through Sanger technology. The in silico prediction models used were Polyphen2, SIFT, MutationTaster, PHRED, MutationAssssor. Results: Both sisters showed typical laboratory findings of VDDR-1A including hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated ALP and PTH. Further assesments demonstrated normalelevated levels of 25-OH vitamin D with low 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D. Radiological workup revealed osteopenia, widened and irregular epiphyseal plates and in the older sister rachitic rosary. We therefore sequenced the entire coding region of genes that has been associated to this clinical condition. Both sisters showed the homozigotic mutation p.Leu169Pro (c.596TC) of CYP27B1 gene that has never been described before. All prediction models consider this mutation harmful. Both sisters immediately started 1,25-(OH) Vitamin D supplementation (N.E. took a galenic formulation of Calcium too). They both showed an adequate but incomplete treatment response with psychomotor retardation improvement, weight gain, normalization of serum Ca and P levels and a significant decrease of PTH and ALP levels. Conclusion: We report a novel pathogenic mutation of CYP27B1 that leads to VDDR-1A. An early diagnosis is necessary to prevent serious complications of rickets that are only partially reversible. Introduction: Piebaldism is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the C-KIT gene located on chromosome 4q12-13. In the presence of this mutation, a defect occurs in the migration and subsequent proliferation of melanoblasts in some body areas during the embryonic development, causing acromy due to the absence of melanin production. The most suggestive clinical finding is a triangular acromic area in frontal region associated with hair depigmentation (poliosis), present in 80-90% of the cases. Other areas such as limbs, chest and abdominal region may also be affected. Skin changes are present from birth and remain stable over time. The differential diagnosis is made with other cutaneous pigmentation disorders, such as vitiligo, total albinism, Tietz Syndrome and Waardenburg Syndrome. Case Presentation: A female newborn presented at birth with an acromic macula at the frontal region with associated local hair depigmentation and macular hypochromic lesions in previvial regions, forearms, and abdomen. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. She was born of an uneventful first gestation of 39 weeks, had good adaptation to extrauterine life and appropriate to gestational age somatometry at birth. Familial history was positive for piebaldism (mother and maternal aunt). Ophthalmological and auditory evaluation were normal. Currently she is 5 months-old and has adequate psychomotor and statoponderal development.",

            "text": "In the case described, the presence of circumscribed poliosis associated with areas of depigmentation in the limbs and abdomen since birth, the stable course and positive family history, helped in the diagnosis and differentiation from vitiligo. The remaining entities are excluded, taking into account the objective examination and auditory and ophthalmologic evaluations performed. Conclusion: The conjugation of the clinical history, genealogical tree and objective examination is crucial to the diagnosis of this pathology, obviating the need for complementary tests. Introduction: Gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, expressed by excessive accumulation of gangliosides in central nervous system and reticulo-histiocytar tissue, caused by lysosomal hydrolysis deficiency. Objectives: Gangliosidosis is a pathology that affects both neurologic and physical development with progressing regression, involving severe complication and unfavorable prognosis, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration for management and therapeutic attitude. Case report: We present the case of a male patient aged 18 months, admitted to the Pediatric Neurology Clinic \"Alexandru Obregia \"for global developmental delay including cognitive and motor regression. He had multiple intercurrent respiratory infections during the first months of life, and at the age of 5 months was admitted in \"Grigore Alexandrescu Children`s Emergency Hospital\", and at abdominal examination hepatomegaly was reported. After excluding other causes, giving the evidence of the medical history, the lysosomal enzyme activity was measured, highlighting the low value of betagalactosidase. After discharge of the hospital, the child had multiple admissions for respiratory intercurrences, presenting also cognitive and motor regression. Upon admission to the neurology clinic, the child was athrepsic, with dysmorphic features, generalized telengiectasis, proeminent abdomen, hepatomegaly, severe developmental disorder, generalized hypotonia, development level below 3 months of age. The ophthalmologic examination revealed the appearance of cherry red-spot. Cardiac ultrasound has not shown any changes at that time. Repeating enzyme dosing revealed low activity of betagalactosidase, which associated with clinical and paraclinic signs confirmed suspected gangliosidosis -most likely type I. In the following month the child presented cardiomyopathy requiring admission in teritorrial unit. Conclusion: Gangliosidosis is one of the rare causes of global development disorder with regression in the first two years of life. Diagnosis is a challenge, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration. Prognosis is unfavorable because of the associated complications, with no curative treatment so far, life expectancy usually is only two years in type I gangliosidosis.

            "text": "Background: Bloch Sulzberger Syndrome (incontinentia pigmenti) is hereditary X-linked disease with skin lesion and generalized ectodermal and mesodermal dysplasia. The disease affects 1:91,000 children. It is caused by NEMO/IKK-gamma gene mutation, which is located on chromosome Xq28, however, the implication of mutation in Xp11 and Xq21 segments is not excluded in case with other phenotypes of that syndrome. In the clinical course of the disease, 4 stages can be singled out: bullous or vesicular, hypertrophic, pigmental and atrophic. Extracutaneous changes are found in 50% of patients. The most common are: dental anomaly (dentin deficiency or absence of a teeth row); visual organs disorders (cataract, vascular anomalies and profound changes of retina epithelium); CNS injury (spastic paralysis, convulsive disorder, mental retardation). Congenital heart disease, anomalies of skull, anomalies of kidneys, nail dystrophy, etc. occur less frequently. Case Report: Eight-month-old girl was admitted in allergology department with numerous erythematic-pigmental and papularbullous linear rash forming along Blaschko lines. Some bullous elements were covered with hard crust (photo 1). Clinical blood and urine analysis, biochemical blood test and immunogram showed no abnormality. Neurosonography, ultrasonic diagnosis and echocardiography did not find any pathology. The patient was initially diagnosed with multiforme bullous erythema. Differential diagnosis was made with herpes zoster, bullous impetigo, bullous mastocytosis. According to anamnesis, the first symptoms occurred in the maternity department, where the child was diagnosed and treated for herpes. Genetic confirmation is not available in Ukraine. However, classic clinical criteria confirm the diagnosis. Today, the girl is 3 years old. CNS injury and visual organs disorders were not discovered. Bullous rash occasionally recur associated with respiratory condition. Pigmentation areas are present on skin along Blaschko lines (photo 2,3), as well as atrophic skin changes. There are areas of cicatrix alopecia on the skin of the head. Conclusion: Although Bloch Sulzberger Syndrome is a rare disease, classic symptomatology is indicative of the right diagnosis. These children require case follow-up for early detection of optic nerve disorder and CNS injury. Objective: To report 4 cases of mild-moderate AED in four sisters, whose father also suffers from AED with the complete phenotype. Methods: Clinical data were collected from a family with this disease. Results: We report 4 cases of AED in four sisters. The genetical test revealed X-linked mutation of AED gen in all of them. Case 1: 1 year old girl, she has had 2 bacterial pneumonias, recurrent wheezing and recurrent episodes of high grade fever. She has sparse hair, hypotricosis and small and pointed teeth. She is able to sweat. Case 2: 2 years old girl, she has had 4 bacterial pneumonias, recurrent wheezing and recurrent episodes os high-grade fever. She has sparse hair, hypotricosis (image 1)and small and pointed teeth (image 2). She has very dry skin and she is not able to sweat, so it is very difficult to treat fever. Case 3 : 3 years old girl, asimptomatyc. Case 4 : 4 years old gir, she never had pneumonias but she has pointed teeth (picture 3) and sparse hair (picture 4) Conclusion: the same genetic mutation presents with different grades of phenotypic alterations in the same family. It is important to suspect AED in children with rare teeth and sparse hair and freqent fever episodes. The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of enzymes required for the stepwise breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). MPS is a rare condition, with an estimated total incidence of approximately 1 in 20000 live births. MPS type II or Hunter syndrome is a hereditary genetic disease linked to the X chromosome and is caused by the enzymatic deficiency of iduronate-2sulfatase. A 28-month-old boy, was admitted in paediatric with language difficulties. He has no relevant obstetric and family history. Normal growth with cephalic perimeter always in P95. Bilateral inguinal hernia surgery at 15 months. Chronical nasal obstruction with adenoid hypertrophy. Normal motor development with small delay in expressive language. We observed macrocephaly, rough facial features (including a broad nose, thick lips and enlarged mouth and tongue), excessive body hair growth and hepatomegaly. The abdominal echography revealed hepatomegaly without splenomegaly or other alterations. Electrical and echocardiogram were normal. Without hearing loss or cornea opacity. The analytical study showed normal hemogram, lipid panel, hepatic and thyroid function. From the remaining investigation is important to emphasize the increased levels of GAG's in urine excretion. He was sent to Metabolic Unit, where was confirmed and diagnosed the enzymatic deficiency of iduronate-2sulfatase, MPS type II. He began enzyme replacement therapy at 32 months with regression of hepatomegaly and improved facial features. The MPS is a lysosomal disease with large spectrum of presentation with severe types manifested in first year or attenuated forms with diagnostic in adult. There for it is necessary a high suspicion to do the diagnosis. In the present case, the early diagnosis was possible due to a detailed clinical history and a meticulous objective examination. The early enzyme replacement therapy leads to a better quality of life whereas after the establishment of the sequels these are not reversible. Aim: To develop a prognostic score predictive of persistent thrombocytopenia in acute primary immune thrombocytopenic (PIT) in children. Methods: Two retrospective cohorts of PIT collected from two pediatric departments over a similar period of 25-year. One cohort served for the derivation of the score and the second served for the external validation. Inclusion criteria were: PIT age between 2 months and 14 years and persistent thrombocytopenia less than 100,000 / mm3 after 6 months of follow-up. The data was analyzed using statistical software SPAD version 5.5. The predictive index was done through a discriminant analysis. Results: 219 cases were collected in the two studies, respectively: 149 cases (mean age = 5.7 years, sex ratio M / F = 1.48) from the derivation population and 70 cases from the validation population (mean age = 5.4 years, sex ratio M/F = 1.5). The developed score had 6 parameters: beginning onset, failure of the first line treatment, the presence of a triggering factor, age, platelet rate at 1 month and platelet rate at 3 months. The sum of the different coefficients for each patient provides a result convertible to probability of persistence of thrombocytopenia after 6 months. The ROC curve (Receiver operating characteristic) showed a good specificity (93%) and a good sensitivity of (90%) for a threshold of 35. The external validation study showed a good specificity e (100%) and good sensitivity (83.3%). Conclusion: This prognostic clinical score validated by an external study requires further prospective studies to improve validation level and to explore its practical utility.",

            "text": "Background: Lymphadenopathy in children is common and generally benign and self-limited. Specific accompanying systemic symptoms can call for attention for a manifestation of serious underlying disease. Case description: A 16-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with a two-month history of a rapidly progressing nontender unilateral cervical mass, with no fever or other complaints. On thorough history, there was an objective weight loss of 8 percent of body weight and increased night sweats over the last few weeks. There were no complaints of pruritus and no past medical history of previous infections, exposures to toxins or evidence of underlying immune deficiencies or familial cancer. On physical examination a localized bulky, firm, rubbery, nontender lymphadenopathy in the lower cervical and supraclavicular region was found. There was no facial edema, dysphagia or dyspnea. He had a clear oropharynx and no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or skin lesions. His blood tests revealed leukocytosis (22600/uL) with elevated C-reative protein (9,45mg/dL) and sedimentation rate (42mm/h). A CT scan revealed cervical lymphadenopathy in relation with a large mediastinal mass surrounding the aorta, causing complete obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and significant compression of the trachea (axis 5mm). He underwent an excisional biopsy of the lymph node, diagnosing classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). He was referred to Hematology to initiate treatment. Conclusion: HL is the most common childhood cancer in the 15-to 19year-old age group. Most patients present with only painless lymphadenopathy, usually cervical or supraclavicular. Seventy-five percent have a mediastinal mass at the time of presentation with risk of SVC syndrome. Nonspecific systemic symptoms including night sweats and weight loss, classified as \"B\" symptoms, are important indicators of malignant disease and warrant a detailed history and complete physical examination for early detection. Background: In our previous study, fetal exposure to ovalbumin caused Th2-skewed immunity.

One month later, recipient mice were assessed for their T-cell activation by IL-2 release and T-cell polarization by IL-4, IL-5 and IFN\u03b3 secretion in the culture system under HPV E7 stimulation using ELISA. Lymphocyte proliferation was also measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Recipients were further evaluated for their resistance to TC-1 tumor cell challenge by monitoring tumor growth and recipient survival following subcutaneous inoculation of 10 5 TC-1 cells. Results: After adoptive transfer of HPV E7-loaded fetal macrophages,recipient lymphocytes exhibited the activity of lymphocyte activation and proliferation specifically in response to HPV E7 stimulation as evidenced by significant IL2 secretion and tritium incorporation. Recipient lymphocytes displayed a Th1-skewed phenotype as evidenced by significant secretion of IFN\u03b3 rather than IL-4 and IL-5 under HPV E7 stimulation. Adoptive transfer of HPV E7-loaded fetal macrophages sufficed to protect the recipients from TC-1 tumorigenesis with tumor-free survivals of 70% at 2-month follow-up, but failed to completely eliminate pre-existing TC-1 cells despite perceptible attenuation of local TC-1 tumor growth. Conclusion: Following endocytosis of tumor antigens, fetal macrophages could trigger tumor antigen-specific T-cell immunity to preclude tumorigenesis. It shed light on the crucial role of fetal macrophages in tumor immune surveillance, thereby eliminating transformed cells egressing during embryogenesis. Background: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect and has a wide variety of clinical manifestations. The highest frequencies are seen in Africa, Asia and Mediterranean region, but with world globalization it`s becoming prevalent worldwide. Objective: Characterization of a pediatric G6PDH deficient cohort followed in a suburban area of an European capital. Methods: Retrospective study of children with G6PD deficiency in a Pediatric Hematology consultation (2013 to 2018). Record data: demographic, clinical and laboratory information. Results: 34 children were included, most of them male (82%) and with African ancestry (74%). The median age at diagnosis was 1.1 years (IQR 28days-7.8years). Diagnosis was made after: acute hemolytic anemia episode (n=13;38%), neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (n=10;29%), family screening (n=6;18%), neonatal anemia (n=3;9%) or investigation of anemia (n=2;6%). Median enzymatic activity was 1.3U/gHb (range 0.3-4.8U/gHb; reference 5U/gHb) and there was no difference between gender. Concomitantly, 3 patients had alpha-thalassemia, 2 sickle-cell disease and 2 hemoglobin Hope. 76% had neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, 75% of these with phototherapy criterion and 1 needed exchange-transfusion; 35% had neonatal anemia and 41% had at least one episode of acute hemolytic anemia, 50% trigged by ingestion of fava beans and 43% by infection. At the acute hemolytic episode, mean minimum hemoglobin was 6.4\u00b12.7g/dL and 50% needed blood transfusion.",

Since 2015 our unit has been providing paediatric surgical support services to a developing tropical nation, and we have also noted an incidence of approximately 1/10,000. Objective: To review the incidence and details of our series of Pacific Island SCT. Methods: Retrospective review of SCT cases 2015-April 2019 inclusive was performed, including patient demographics, diagnosis, operation performed, and histopathology (where available). Incidence was calculated using World Bank population data. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata\u00a9. Results: In total 8 patients presented with SCT in the study period. Mean age was 1 year (range 0-4). Five (62.5%) were female. Four (50%) were type 1 SCT, with two Type 2, and two Type 3. All eight were surgically typical of SCT, and were treated with primary excision. One is lost to follow-up. Of the eight operated on, three have been brought to Australia, and five had their operations at home. Available pathology showed benign mature SCT in all. One report has been lost, and one is awaited. Given a local birth rate of 28.7 per 1000/year, the approximate incidence of SCT regionally was 1 per 9840 births. Conclusion: SCT remains a rare tumour, but local real incidence may be higher. Given that our observed incidence fits with the higher recently published incidences, we ask whether there has been a real worldwide increase in incidence of SCT over recent decades, or whether there is significant regional variability in incidence. We incidentally note the benefits of links between rich and poor world health services. Background: Acute leukemia represents the main cause of neoplastic disease in pediatric age. The most frequent clinical presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, fever, anorexia, weight loss, asthenia and sweating. Although other forms of extramedullary involvement may exist, initial parotid infiltration is very rare. Clinical Case: A previously healthy nine-year-old boy was admitted to the emergency department due to progressive bilateral preauricular swelling over the last 10 days, with no other associated systemic symptomatology. Bilateral exuberant and painless parotid swelling was observed, with hard consistency and adhesion to the deep planes, as well as submandibular adenopathy, the larger with 3cm, hard and painless, without other changes on clinical examination. Blood tests showed 27810/uL leukocytes [normal (N) 5000-15000/uL], 18080/uL lymphocytes (N 1500-7000/uL), hemoglobin 9,9g/dL (N 11,5-15,5g/dL), mean globular volume 80,2fL (N 72-84fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 26,9pg (N 25-33pg), platelets 111000/uL (N 150000-500000/uL), peripheral blood smear with atypical lymphocytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 9,2mm/h (N 0-10mm/h), LDH 567 IU/L (N Conclusion: Bilateral parotid swelling constitutes a rare initial presentation form of acute leukemia. The present case underlines the importance of clinical suspicion of neoplastic disease in the presence of parotid swelling with atypical evolution and in the absence of associated inflammatory signs. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) accounts for approximately seven percent of childhood malignancy. It should be suspected in a child with lymphadenopathy, systemic complaints and mediastinal mass. Differential diagnosis includes other malignant, infectious and inflammatory diseases. A 12-year-old female, with a six-month background of 15 percent weight loss, night sweats and fatigue and a recent diagnosis of microcytic hypochromic anaemia (Hgb 8.2 g/dL), presented at our emergency department due to aggravated anaemia (Hgb 7.9 g/dL) after a 30-day trial of iron therapy. Respiratory, gastrointestinal and bleeding symptoms were denied. Dietary restrictions, sick contacts and family history of autoimmune diseases were excluded. On examination, she presented fever, pallor and no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Initial laboratory results confirmed microcytic hypochromic anaemia refractory to iron therapy. Blast cells were not seen on blood film, nor other morphologic abnormalities except microcytosis and atypical lymphocytes. It was also apparent an increase of acute-phase reactants (ferritin 515.3ng/mL, ESR 118 mm/hour), without elevated faecal calprotectin. Abdominal ultrasound was normal, however chest radiography revealed a subtle mediastinal widening. CT scan displayed an anterior mediastinal conglomerate of lymph nodes (8.7 x 6.5 x 9 cm) and mild splenomegaly (12.6 cm). She was transferred to an oncology center and excisional biopsy revealed a classical HL. Bone marrow involvement was excluded on aspiration and biopsy and FDG-PET scan confirmed supradiaphragmatic nodal involvement. About three-quarters of paediatric HL cases display a mediastinal mass on chest radiograph at the time of presentation. Mediastinal widening should never be overlooked particularly in the setting of classic B symptoms (fever, night sweats and \u226510 percent loss within six months before diagnosis). It should also be noted that malignant diseases as HL can produce microcytic anaemia, which may be misinterpreted as iron deficiency. Prompt referral to an oncology center is mandatory for diagnosis, staging and management. Introduction: We present the case of a 5 months old baby with severe hemolytic anemia. Case presentation: The infant was admitted through transfer from another hospital with the diagnosis of severe anemia (Hemoglobin (Hb) = 3.6 g/dl) -apparently with sudden onset, no infections or treatments administered within the last 7 days. The clinical examination revealed a baby in poor clinical condition with intense pale skin, scleral icterus, tachycardia (150 -170 b/min), systolic murmur of 2/6 in the V-th parasternal left space, hepatosplenomegaly. The blood analysis indicate severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Hb = 3.6 g/dl, with high reticulocyte count, hyperbilirubinemia, hypersideremia , positive Coombs test). The blood transfusion was postponed (due to the presence of several classes of autoantibodies -IgG 3+; IgM 2+; C3c+/-; C3d3+) and treatment with corticoids was started (first intravenously with Methylprednisolone 30 mg/day, slowly tapered and then orally with Prednisone). Under the treatment, the evolution was favourable -from both clinic (good general condition, normal skin colour, no jaundice or hepatosplenomegaly) and biologic point of view (with progressive increase of the hemoglobin until the normal value for the age, negative direct Coombs test and normal values of sideremia and bilirubinemia). Conclusion: It is essential that patients with severe anemia be admitted in a department were they can be completely investigated in order to get the appropriate treatment. Background: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, however its location on the ear or temporal bone is quite rare. We present a case report of an uncommon clinical presentation of this disease. Clinical Case: Male child, 6 years old, healthy, presenting right ear otalgy, homolateral face oedema and lip commissure asymmetry. A suggestive examination prompted an initial diagnose of an Acute Media Otitis complicated with facial palsy. Oral treatment was started, initially with amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/day and prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day, after which, due to lack of improvement, with cefuroxime 40 mg/kg/day, and a new course of prednisolone. Because of progressive worsening symptoms, a hospital admission was proposed for intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day + Clindamycin 20 mg/kg/day) and corticotherapy (prednisolone 2 mg/kg/ day) and further investigation. Urgent Computerized Tomography of the ear showed a right erosive media and external otitis, with total opacification of the ear, and mastoid osteitis on various locations, and Magnetic Resonance revealed a bulky tumefactive lesion, involving the right temporal bone. An exploratory tympanomastoidectomy was proposed, revealing a bulky obliterative polypoid lesion, that was partially removed, with pericortical, cortical, tegmen tympani and mastoid invasion from a polypoid-like neoformation submitted to biopsy. A n a t o m o p a t h o l o g i c a l e x a m i n a t i o n , r e v e a l e d a Rhabdomyosarcoma of the ear. Chemotherapy was started, with clinical improvement. Conclusion: Rhabdomyosarcoma presentation symptoms can often mimic Chronic Suppurative Acute Media Otitis, making it a challenging, but important differential, as an early diagnosis can dramatically influence the overall survival rates. Introduction: Methotrexate is an essential drug in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia diseases. In this population, neurotoxicity has a prevalence range between 2.3-15% and can be characterized by a broad range of signs and symptoms (from headache to strokelike symptoms). Case Report: We present a young girl (11-year-old) with lymphoblastic lymphoma (in phase IIA) who as a history of leukoencephalopathy, which mimicked stroke (a transient episode of mild right central facial paresis, right hemiparesis with flexion of the finger and ataxia) one week after treatment with high doses intravenous methotrexate. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed \"probable hyperacute ischemic lesion in the territory of perforating arteries of the left middle cerebral artery\"; cervical eco-doppler and Bubber test were normal; thrombophilia study at the beginning of treatment of oncologic was normal. The patient`s symptoms completely improve within two days without sequels and was medicated with antiplatelet agent. Ten days after a new administration of methotrexate, she presented with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. Again with full resolution. The patient was discharged home without neurological symptoms and continued to the maintenance phase under prophylaxis with destometrophan (20 mg, 3 times daily) without intercurrences. Conclusions: Neurotoxicity associated with methotrexate is transient and most patients continue to receive this therapy without intercurrences. Symptoms can be treated previously by administration of destometrophan and it is important that healthcare professionals recognize this entity. Introduction: Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is a rare primary immunodeficiency belonging to the subgroup of immune dysregulation diseases. It's a disorder of lymphocytic apoptosis' mediators, with subsequent generalized chronic non-malignant and noninfectious lymphoproliferation, and expansion of an unusual population of T lymphocytes (double-negative T cells). Chronic lymphadenomegaly and/or splenomegaly and autoimmune cytopenias are common characteristics. Clinical Case: Four-year-old male, without personal relevant background, observed in paediatric consultation, due to cervical lymphadenopathy detected by two years of age, exacerbated in infectious contexts and in the last six months. Splenomegaly noticed during an acute febrile episode. Without constitutional symptoms. Maternal family history: autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. At physical examination, he had elastic and mobile cervical bilateral adenopathy conglomerates and splenomegaly. Complementary diagnostic tests (in fasting and without disease): Cervical echography: multiple ganglionic formations probably of reactive nature. Abdominal ultrasonography: globous liver and splenomegaly, with multiple ganglionic formations adjacent to splenic thread and pancreas. Blood test: Haemoglobin 12,3 g/dL, Total leucocytes 6,4x10 9 /L, Platelets 144x10 9 /L (150-450), Peripheral blood smear \"reactive lymphocytes and slight anisocytosis\", C-reactive protein 0,46 mg/dL, Cholesterol HDL 18 mg/dL (45), Triglycerides 207 mg/dL (\u226490), IgA 197 mg/dL, IgG 2150 mg/dL (350-1620), IgM 20 mg/dL (30 -265).Considering the diagnosis of ALPS, he was sent to a Tertiary Hospital's primary immunodeficiency consultation. The subsequent study reveals: B12 8124 pg/mL (295-1769); Immunophenotyping 10% lymphocytes \u03b1/\u03b2CD3+CD4-CD8-; Genetic study: Fas deficit heterozygosity for mutation c.817CA (p.Q273K). He completed two prednisolone cycles. Currently (7 years old), under sirolimus, with frank improvement in lymphadenopathy dimensions and hepatosplenomegaly.",

            "text": "Conclusion: This clinical case illustrates the importance of the high level of clinical suspicion regarding generalized chronic lymphadenopathies and/or splenomegaly. Despite ALPS's non-malignant nature, the diagnosis may be quite challenging and requires long-term clinical surveillance, particularly because of the increased risk of malignancy. Background: Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations, which may affect multiple organs. Symptoms develop over time and are more likely to appear in adulthood. Case Presentation: Ten-year-old girl with a medical history of atopic dermatitis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura at 3 years of age and positive Phadiatop test for inhalant allergens. Her mother, uncle and maternal grandmother had Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. At the age of 8 presented frequent spontaneous epistaxis, several times a week, even while sleeping, without seasonal predominance. There were no visible telangiectasias and no anemia was detected. Right anterior rhinoscopy showed vascular ectasia. It was decided in Genetics appointment to perform molecular study, which confirmed the presence of the family mutation of the gene ACVRL1 C. 1232G A p.arg411Gln, at 9 years old. The results of abdominal and vesical ultrasound, electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. She had menarche at the age of 10 years. At 10 years old she was evaluated because of easy fatigability, mainly at afternoon. Bilateral vascular ectasias throughout septal mucosa were detected at anterior rhinoscopy. Blood tests indicated an iron deficiency anemia (Hb 10.1 g/dl, with presence of target cells in peripheral blood smear and ferritin 3 ng/ml). She started iron oral supplementation 6 mg/Kg/ day. One month later control hemogram indicated an hemoglobin rise to 13.3 g/dl and ferritin 16 ng/mL. Actually she is waiting for a contrast echocardiogram, brain angio-magnetic resonance imaging and new abdominal ultrasonography for arteriovenous malformations screening. Discussion: Epistaxis is the most common symptom of the disease. If it appears in pediatric age, it is typically after 10 years old, and rarely requires invasive interventions to control bleeding. This child presents an exuberant phenotype, and therapeutic experience is scarce in the approach of the pathology at such an early age. Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in infants and children, Neuroblastoma tends to behave quite differently in infants as compared to children over 12-18 months. We present a rare case of neuroblastoma presenting with skin rash as a preliminary finding.",

            "text": "A 39-day-old male patient with no medical history was admitted to our hospital with yellow bullous rash that started on the face and spread throughout the body in 15 days. The patient was born at term by caesarean section. His neurologic development is appropriate for his age. There is no family history and his parents are not related. On physical examination, he had yellow bullous rash all around his body , inspiratory stridor was auscultated and respiratory distress was seen. The patient was consulted to dermatology clinic for his bullous rash and skin biopsy was performed. Bullous pemfigoid was detected pathologically, which is rare condition in infancy. Because the patient had inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress chest X-Ray was performed and reported normal. For further evaluation the patient was consulted to pediatric pulmonary specialist and with their suggestion thorax CT was performed. A solid mass that was suspected to be a neuroblastoma was found. So we performed abdominal MRI, and taken tru cut biopsy and determined neuroblastoma. \u0130mmunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte subgroups were analyzed and found normal due to suspicion of immune deficiency. Conclusion: Rashes are extremely common in infancy. Most of them are innocent and transient. However, serious infectious, congenital skin diseases and sometimes malignant tumors should be kept in mind when dealing with a rash in infancy. We recommend that every infant with a skin rash and respiratory distress should be investigated for a infancy neuroblastoma. The clinician should keep in mind that skin rash may be the first clinical finding of neuroblastoma. Study of the dental disease prevalence in children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Objective: to study the prevalence of caries in children with type iron deficiency anemia Materials and Methods: A study of 1,500 people of children and adolescents in rural areas of Karaganda region aged from 3 to 17 years with IDA and dental diseases was conducted. 765 (51%) of them are boys and 735 (49%) are girls. Total number of children with IDA was 812 (54% of the total number surveyed). Mild IDA was in 288 (35.5%) children, moderate -in 181 (22.3%), severe -in 51 (6.4%). Results: The prevalence of caries was 69.4% in patients with anemia, the prevalence of periodontal disease was 39%, dental-anomalies occurred most of all in children with anemia -96,1%. The highest prevalence of caries in children with anemia was observed in preschool (73.9%) and younger school age (77.2%). In IDA, a mildly chronice form of caries was found in 54.3% of cases, the subacute form of caries was 9.51%, and the acute form -in 0.84%. With moderate IDA 39.1%, 14.8% and 12.2% respectively. When severe IDA -32.4%, 32.4% and 19.1%, respectively. With an increase in the severity of IDA, a dynamic increase in caries was observed, indicating a direct correlation. Conclusions: The prevalence of caries in 3-6 year old children on the background of IDA is 75.6% and without IDA -71.3% (p 0.001), in 7-11 year old children 79.2% and 74.9% (p 0.001), in 12-17 year old children -52.6% and 52.6% (p 0.001), respectively. Background: Orofacial infections of odontogenic origin are a common and important health concern in the pediatric population. Incorrect or late treatment may lead to serious and possibly life threatening complications. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the data on pediatric hospitalizations due to odontogenic infections and to isolate parameters predicting prolonged length of stay (LOS). Methods: Data was collected from the records of patients (age 15 years) who were hospitalized due to odontogenic infections in Pediatric/ Oral and maxillofacial surgery department in Baruch Padeh Poriya Medical Center-Israel between 1/2010-12/2015. Facial infections of other origin was excluded. Results: A total of 411 patients were included. 58.7% of them were males, 66.9% of non-Jewish ethnicity. Roughly half were discharged after one day of hospitalization. 42.8% of patients were not previously treated with antibiotics. 79.8% of patients did not present 38\u00b0body temperature at admission and 98.8% of them were treated by drainage with or without extraction of the involved tooth. 91% of patients received antibiotics after discharge and 4.6% were admitted for rehospitalization. The calculated OR for odontogenic infections in patients from Arab background was 2.5 significantly higher (p0.0001) than their Jewish counterparts. The mean age in the study was 6.53\u00b12.59 years. There was significantly higher (P0.05) values of White Blood Cells (WBC) and platelets in patients with 3 days LOS, patients with 3 days LOS were significantly older (8.36 vs 6.28) and OR for a prolonged LOS in Arab patients was 2.55 comparing to Jewish patients (p=0.01). Conclusion: Risk factors for prolonged LOS were: older age, Arab ethnicity and higher WBC count and platelets values at admission. Background : Community acquired pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality globally, although the etiology of CAP varies by age, viruses remain the most etiologic agent and may lead to sever disease especially in children with co-morbidities. Data on community acquired pneumonia in children were found to be limited in Qatar.",

            "text": "Objectives: This study aimed to determine common virus associated with CAP in hospitalized children and to identify risk factor for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. Methods: A cross-sectional single institutional retrospective descriptive study was performed at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary and academic medical center in the State of Qatar. The study included children admitted with communityacquired pneumonia from Dec 2017-June 2018, details of demographic and respiratory viral as detected by molecular assays were analyzed Results: Total of 59 hospitalized children with diagnose of CAP between 3 months-14 years were included,mean age at diagnosis 3 years.43 patients (73%)had positive PCR nasal swab,single virus isolated in 31case,multiple viruses in 12 cases. The most isolated virus was Rhinovirus(21%),Human Meta-pneumovirus(17%),Boca virus(15%),H1N1influenza virus(8%),Respiratory Syncytial Virus and corona viruses were the least common with(7%) each. Nearly 20/ 59(33%)of children admitted to PICU,15(25%) had positive viruses in which the most frequent were H1N1influnza and Rhinovirus with longer PICU stay (median 10 days). Common risk factor associated with PICU hospitalization;prematurity and bronchial asthma. Conclusions: Our study revealed that Rhinovirus and HMP Virus were the most common causative agents in hospitalized children with CAP. This finding in contrasts with a previous report from WHO in which RSV was the most frequently isolated virus. H1N1influanza virus play a major role in PICU admission, we need to increase public and healthcare providers knowledge to annual vaccine. Background: Vaccines are the most effective public health interventions against many vaccine-preventable diseases. In recent years, the number of parents refusing recommended childhood vaccination increased significantly. The concept of increasing vaccine refusal has emerged in the world in the 1990s and in Turkey in the beginning of 2010. Here, we report a clinical case of an infant with severe pertussis with vaccinerefusing parents. Case Presentation: A 13 months-old girl was admitted to emergency department with a 10-day history of cough, which was gradually progressive. She was diagnosed with viral upper respiratory tract infection in another hospital. On examination, body temperature was 38.2 c , oropharynx was hyperemic and bilateral crackles were detected by lung auscultation. The remaining findings on her physical examinations were normal. Laboratory investigations showed the following results: WBC: 66.900/mm3 (80% lymphocyte), CRP negative, ESR 19mm/h, blood biochemistry, liver and kidney function tests were normal. Bilateral infiltrations were seen on chest radiography. Patient was diagnosed with pneumonia, and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. Pertussis was suspected because of the infant`s persistent cyanotic cough and apnea, intravenous clarithromycin was added to antibiotherapy. Two days later, her WBC count had increased to 79.800/mm3 (85% lymphocyte). No tumor cells was detected in peripheral blood smear. She was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit with, generalized tonic seizure after coughing. Brain computed tomography examinations and EEG were normal. The culture of nasopharyngeal secretions and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were both positive for B. Pertussis. During his follow-ups, on 14th day of hospitalization, her WBC count gradually dropped, physical examination was normal and she was discharged from the hospital. The patient had been given all the missing vaccinations in the follow-up after discharge of the baby as a convinced family vaccination after discussing her illness with her parents and explaining all the facts of the event. Conclusion: Children of parents who refuse immunizations are at increased risk of in for vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccine refusal also increases the risk for the whole community. All parents should be informed about the benefits of vaccination and risk of severe infection deseases. Background/Objective: Spondylodiscitis is a rare entity in pediatrics. The low specificity of symptoms and laboratory data, the scarcity of physical examination findings and the late radiographic changes justify the usually late diagnosis. Methods: 15-month-old boy with irrelevant personal and family history. Presented to our emergency department with notion of pain in the previous 15 days, characterized by periods of polypnea and irritability. Progressive worsening in the previous week, with nocturnal awakening, improvement with ibuprofen, and antalgic position in dorsal decubitus or lumbar hyperextension, with gait refusal in the last days. History of diarrhea 2 weeks before admission. He looked prostrate, complaining while sitting but had no pain in passive mobilization of the lower limbs or in palpation/percussion of the spine. He started fever at the hospital that persisted for 2 days. The blood panel showed ESR 55mm and ALP 1076 U/L and no increase in CRP or leukocytosis. CT showed vertebral irregularity of D9-D10 with possible relation to bone destruction secondary to spondylodiscitis. He was transferred to a tertiary hospital, where the MRI confirmed the diagnosis. Serologies for Brucella, Bartonella and Coxiella, blood culture, IGRA and PCR for bacterial DNA were negative. After 8 days of intravenous ceftriaxone IV he was asymptomatic and was discharged with oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for 5 weeks. Conclusion: Spondylodiscitis usually has an insidious onset of symptoms. Although children may report low back and walking pain, infants may initially only show nonspecific signs such as irritability. Therefore, it is important to remember this illness, especially as it may have serious complications. MRI is the key standard for an early diagnosis and followup of disease progression. Results: A total of 32 patients were included in the study (brain abscess 31%, subdural empyema 31%, brain + subdural 6%, epidural abscess 25%). Age range was 1,5 months to 16 years (median 6 years). Male/female ratio was 2:1. Predisposing factors were identified in all patients. Most important predisposing factors were mastoiditis and sinusitis (56%), complex congenital cardiopathy (16%) and bacterial meningitis (13%). Etiologic agents were identified in 18 patients (Staphylococcus aureus 28%; Streptococcus pneumoniae 28%; Streptococcus intermedius 22%; gram-negative bacilli 17%). Fever, headache, earache, vomits and seizures (41%) were the signs and symptoms most often described. Half of patients underwent surgery of the CNS abscess (brain abscess 75%, epidural abscess 25%). Two main initial antibiotic schemes were used, cefotaxima-vancomycinmetronidazole (42%) and meropenem-vancomycin (48%). More frequently used oral antibiotics were quinolones, metronidazole and linezolid. Median of duration of antibiotic treatment (intravenous + oral) was 69 days (range 40-120). One patient died and seven had permanent sequels. Conclusions: Congenital heart diseases and otorhinolaryngological infections were the main underlying disorders. Antibiotic therapy was enough to resolve small epidural abscesses and small subdural empyema. But most patients with brain abscesses and big subdural empyema also required surgical treatment. Background: Treatment of brain abscesses and other intracranial infections requires long lasting antibiotics, glucocorticoids and antiepileptic therapy. Antibiotics with good diffusion to CNS and inside abscesses are the preferred ones. Medicaments related adverse events are frequent in these patients. Generally, they force to change the planned treatment. Objective: To describe drugs related adverse events during treatment of pediatric patients with CNS abscesses. Methods: Retrospective single-center study of pediatric patients treated for CNS abscesses. Results: A total of 32 patients were included in the study (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) . Presented with brain abscess 31%, subdural empyema 31%, brain abscess + subdural empyema 6% and epidural abscess 25%. Age range was 1,5 months to 16 years (median 6 years). Male/female ratio was 2:1.",

            "text": "Usually, these patients received sequential intravenous and oral treatment. Median of duration of antibiotic treatment (intravenous + oral) was 69 days (range 40-120). Intravenous treatment median was 28 days (range 7-90 days). Received glucocorticoids 47% and antiepileptic drugs 62%. Three patients developed neutropenia (related to linezolid and cotrimoxazole). Four patients developed exanthems. Three patients developed DRESS syndrome (one due to phenytoin and two related to antibiotics). Two patients had knee arthritis related to fluoroquinolones. One patient developed linezolid related peripheric neuropathy. Cushing syndrome was related to prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. Conclusions: Patients treated for CNS pyogenic infections frequently develop drug related adverse events. Careful monitoring of blood counts, liver and renal function and skin disorders is mandatory. Introduction: TORCH congenital infections have a substantial burden of disease, leading to non-genetic, preventable long-term sequelae. Effective interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of TORCH infections are not implemented in Romania. Furthermore, there is a lack of national protocols and guidelines regarding screening and diagnosis of TORCH congenital infections. Methods: The current project was carried out as a collaboration between medical experts from Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy and an information technology team from Stefan S Nicolau National Institute of Virology. The project was supported from UEFISCDI Bridge Grant: PN-III-P2.1-BG-2016-0384 and performed during 2016-2018. Results: We have developed an intelligent system for pregnant women and medical staff, gathering information about the infections tests in TORCH panel and enclosing algorithms for correct screening and diagnosis of TORCH infections in order to reduce the risk of congenital infections. Using practical and non-invasive electronic resources widely available such as smartphones, the authors have created a website portal (https://www.torch.ro/) and an application for mobile phones (MAMI) which allows women to have quick access to correct information about TORCH infections and tests and more important, to obtain an individualized answer regarding TORCH screening and diagnosis which can contribute to further planning and case management carried out by the physician. Conclusion: TORCH-IT portal and MAMI app for smartphone, developed to reduce the risk of congenital infections while helping to obtain a correct diagnosis and management, are expected to become valuable resources for both the patient and the physician, as they are unique in Romania. Background: Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection of an area of skin that is no longer intact. Other causes may include human or animal bites, or injuries that occur in water. Aim of Paper: To demonstrate that there are weird causes that lead to a cellulitis and the importance of a exhaustive differential diagnosis. Matherial and Method: We present the case of a 5 years old girl who arrived to Emergency Room with scalp cellulitis. Six days before, the parents noticed the presence of a wart in the girl\u00b4s scalp that during later days associated pain and redness in the area, accompanied by fever. The girl was attended in Primary Care and was in treatment with Azitromicin. The girl did not had history of trauma or other event.The physical exam revealed a healthy child with a painfull, red scalp area about 5 cm, covered by a crust. We asked for urgent blood tests which revealed elevated acute phase reactants. It has been iniciated intravenous treatment with Augmentine. 2 days later, after scratching, expels a tick. We asked for complete serology tests for Rickettsia and Borrelia, that luckily were negative. The microbiology test informed us about the infection of the bite area with Pantoea agglomerans. The patient had a favorable evolution. After 2 months the ulcer has healed completely but with the persistence of a central scarring alopecia. Disscusion: As we previous comment, there were no history of trauma or other event. The presence of a tick was a surprise for everybody (the tick was previously interpreted as a wart). The luck was that by scratching it fell into bed, and also that all the serology tests were negative. Conclusion: We must always think of all the possible etiologies, no matter how weird it would seem to us.",

Kerion is a severe manifestation of tinea capitis developing from an intense immune response to the infection, which is less common than the non-inflammatory variants. It can often mimic other conditions, leading to inaccurate diagnosis and delay in treatment with scarring alopecia. Objective: Our goal is to report a case of atypical presentation of tinea capitis and highlight the importance of a careful clinical history and examination and timely diagnosis. Methods: We analyzed the atypical presentation of a tinea capitis scalp infection and reviewed the literature. Results: A three-year-old girl presented with a painful, soft plaque in the scalp, 3 cm of larger diameter, with thick crusting, pustules, dark spots, broken hair strands and some drainage areas, evolving for two weeks. She had no other skin lesions nor fever. There had been no trauma, contact with animals nor contacts with similar lesions. After inspection of the lesion, our hypothesis was a kerion. Empirical treatment with oral fluconazole and topic cetoconazol was begun. There were not any lasting lesions nor scarring, after four weeks of treatment. Conclusion: Kerion is often misdiagnosed. Our choice of antibiotic was fluconazole and cetoconazol, as griseofulvin is not available in our country and terbinafine is not available as oral solution. Timely diagnosis and treatment led to recovery without scarring or residual alopecia.",

Laboratory confirmation of disease was available in 31.0% patients; of these, influenza viruses were found in 60.7% samples (influenza A/H1N1 -48.8%, A/H3N2 -16.3%, influenza A subtype-10.6%, influenza B -in 24.3%, other respiratory viruses -39.7%). Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on therapy. Antivirals were not administered to patients in the 1th group. 2th group of patients was treated with umifenovir from the first 24-48 hours after symptom onset. Patients in subgroups 1b (n = 155) and 2b (n = 628) had risk factors (children younger than 2 years old and adults over 65, pregnant women, people with chronic somatic diseases and obesity). Results: Duration of fever and frequency of complications in patients without risk factors were significantly lower in 2a group versus 1a group: 2.86 \u00b1 1.57 days and 3.76 \u00b1 2.83 days, 13.1 \u00b1 1.3% and 20.0 \u00b1 3.2%, accordingly. Duration of fever and frequency of complications in patients with risk factors were significantly lower in 2b group versus 1b group: 3.0 \u00b1 1.48 days and 4.1 \u00b1 2.2 days, 9.9 \u00b1 1.2% and 42.6 \u00b1 3.6%, accordingly. Conclusion: The efficacy of antiviral therapy was higher in patients with risk factors than in patients who are not at risk. In patients treated with umifenovir the duration of fever and frequency of complications were lower than in patients who did not receive antiviral therapy. Methods: The investigators retrospectively analyzed randomly selected medical records of inpatients with influenza and other ARVI in 88 hospitals from 50 regions of the Russian Federation: those of 5287 patients, respectively, by applying parametric and nonparametric statistical methods. Results: Single-factor analysis of variance revealed factors influencing the course of flu-like syndrome and identified risk groups: children younger than 3 years old and adults over 65, pregnant women, and people with chronic somatic diseases and obesity. The high-risk groups exhibited a more severe course of flu-like syndrome than did the patients outside the risk groups. The incidence of complications was higher, especially in the under 2-year-year-old children and in patients with endocrine, metabolic, or respiratory diseases, with a large proportion of complications being pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral therapy (umifenovir) was higher in patients with chronic diseases than in patients not at risk. The duration of fever and frequency of complications proved to be lower than those in patients who did not receive antiviral therapy. Conclusion:The RFs for influenza and ARVI complications are patient`s age (children under 3 years of age and adults older than 65 years), the presence of chronic somatic diseases, and pregnancy. Patients with endocrine, eating, metabolic (including obesity), circulatory, and respiratory disorders are at high risk for influenza and ARVI complications. Umifenovir therapy substantially reduces the duration of fever and risk of complications, especially in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is one of the most common vasculitis of childhood and remains the main cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. It most commonly (90%) affects children before 5 years of age and less frequently (10%) before 6 months of age. The pathophysiology is still unknown, but immunologic factors appear to play an important role. Objective: We present a case that highlights the importance of clinical suspicion of KD, even in the small infant. Methodscase report: A four-month-old female infant was admitted for fever and irritability for 5 days. Vaccination with Meningococcal Group B Vaccine had been instituted 2 days before the show of symptoms. On admission, there were no remarkable physical findings. Laboratory evaluation showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C Reactive Protein (CRP), urinalysis was normal. Blood and urine cultures were obtained and intravenous Ceftriaxone was started. On the 4th day of admission the patient was afebrile, but because of maintained irritability and tympanic temperatures constantly above 37.5\u00b0C, laboratory evaluation was repeated. WBC and CRP values remained elevated, now with associated thrombocytosis and elevated liver enzyme values. Cultures showed no bacterial growth. On the 8 th day, due to the maintained clinical status, laboratory evaluation was once again repeated, and continued to show a rise of the inflammatory markers. KD was considered and echocardiographic evaluation was performed, showing diffuse ectasia of the right coronary arteries (3mm). Treatment with IV immunoglobulin and acetylsalicylic acid was started, with clinical improvement. Conclusion: KD remains an infrequent illness before 4 months of age and its aetiology a cause of debate. This case report highlights the importance of clinical suspicion of KD, even when fever is the only positive diagnostic criteria. Introduction: Haemophilus influenza is a nasopharynx colonizer in children, responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and rarely causes invasive disease, namely meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis or bacteremia. Before routine immunization against Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) was included in National Vaccination Program (NVP) in 1994, this was the main responsible for invasive disease. Afterwards, non-capsulated (NC) strains have been the most frequently implicated.",

Results: Seven cases were identified: three Hib and four NC strains. There were five boys and two girls and a mean age was 18 months (3 m -11 y). Hib vaccination was complete in all children except for one, who wasn`t vaccinated. Major risk factors were prematurity (2), asthma (1), psychomotor development retardation (1), recurrent acute otitis (1), recent tonsillectomy (1) and IgA deficiency (2). Two vaccine failures occurred, a girl with a recent tonsillectomy and a boy with IgA deficiency. Diagnosis was confirmed by isolation of Haemophilus from blood (6), cerebrospinal fluid (3) and pleural fluid (1) . Clinical presentations were meningitis (4), three of them with septicemia, pneumonia (2) and occult bacteremia (1) . Of the Hib infection cases, two presented with meningitis and one with occult bacteremia. One patient with Hib meningitis developed permanent neurosensorial hear loss and ataxia. Three patients were admitted to Intensive Care Unit for a medium of four days. Third generation cephalosporins (5) and ampicillin (2) were the chosen antibiotics. Ampicillin resistance mediated by beta-lactamases was identified in one patient. Discussion: Haemophilus influenza invasive disease represents a potential serious condition. Although NC strains are the most prevalent, Hib is still present and responsible for some cases National epidemiological surveillance is of crucial importance and may help the development of new preventive strategies. Background: The incidence of multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR-PA) has increased in recent years. There is an association between antimicrobial resistance and the increased in mortality and prolonged hospitalization. Objective: To identify risk factors associated with the acquisition of bacteremia due to MDR-PA in pediatric patients Methods: We performed a retrospective case -control study from 2012 to 2018 in Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez in Mexico City. Cases: patients with positive cultures for MDR-PA. Controls: patients with cultures positive for P. aeruginosa susceptible to at least 3 groups of antibiotics. To assess for possible risk factors we perform crosstabs and calculation of odds ratio (OR). A multiple logistic regression model was conducted with significant variables. Results: We analyzed 130 subject (46 cases and 84 controls). Mean age 6.6 years. The Most frequent basal condition was oncologic (42%) and the most frequent diagnosis septic shock (53%). Cephalosporins (56%) was the previous antibiotic more frequently used before the event of bacteremia by MDR-PA. Meropenem was the antibiotic most used as empirical treatment (58.4%).: Previous use of broad spectrum antibiotics (OR 8.2, 95% CI 1.86 -36.65, p 0.01) and previous stay in PICU (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.21-20.39, p 0.01) were associated to bacteremia due to MDR-PA.. There were more cases of complication in the group of MDR-PA bacteremia: septic shock (97.8%, P 0.01) and admission to UTIP (63.3% Conclusion: In our population, risk factors for acquisition of bacteremia due to MDR-PA were previous use of antibiotics and previous stay in PICU. Mortality from bacteremia due to MDR-PA was high (51.8%).",

Alexander 1 1 Royal Hospital for Sick Children, UK Background: Infants under 3 months often present with nonspecific signs and symptoms making it a challenge to diagnose CNS infection in this population. Yet missing the diagnosis can result in significant mortality and morbidity. A recent large review showed low rates of bacterial meningitis (BM) in the under two month population, contributing to increased interest in whether low risk infants can be identified to reduce the need for invasive investigations. Objectives: To look at indications for and results of LP in the less than 3 months population presenting to our hospital and determine whether features exist to aid in stratifying infants as low risk of BM. Methods: Data was retrospectively collected on all infants under 3 months who had LP performed between September 2017 and September 2018. Using the hospital's electronic database we gathered demographic data, initial observations, presenting features and documented indication for LP alongside results from biochemical and bacteriological investigations. Results: 134 LP were performed, 43 in the less than 1 month group and 91 in the 1-3 months group. There were no positive bacteriology results with 26 (19.4%) confirmed cases of viral meningitis. 3 (0.02%) patients were treated for presumed BM (1 was clinically suspected with no LP performed, 1 had raised WCC with positive CSF microscopy and 1 was found to have meningeal thickening on cranial ultrasound scan).

Further research is required to better stratify this population and avoid unnecessary invasive investigation without missing the diagnosis in the small proportion of infants who do have BM possibly allowing a more individualised approach to febrile under 3 month old patients. Results: 40 children were included, the majority male (60%) and of African origin (63%) with mean age of 7.9\u00b15.4years. Lower limb was the most affected (75%), with predominance of femur (35%). Concomitant septic arthritis was present in 28%, being coxofemoral the most affected joint. Main symptoms at presentation were pain at mobilization (90%), spontaneous pain (85%), fever (60%) and local inflammatory signs (55%), with median duration before admission of 2.0days (IQR 1.0-6.0). 45% had leukocytosis, 3% leukopenia, 79% elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate(20mm/h) and 58% elevated Creactive protein(2mg/dL). 53% had risk factors: sickle-cell disease (43%), acute mastoiditis (5%), smallpox (2.5%) and preceding fracture (2.5%).

Methods: culture media (89%) and detection of bacterial DNA by PCR (11%). Magnetic resonance(MRI) was performed in 95%. In all, signs of OA were present. All were treated with antibiotics with median duration of 6.1weeks (IQR 6.0-8.6). Mycobacterium bovis infection was treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs and fungal infection with antibiotics and antifungal drugs. 35% needed surgery and 8% hyperbaric oxygen therapy. There were 11 complications: subperiosteal abscess (n=6;15%), deep soft tissue abscess (n=1;3%), venous thrombosis (n=4;10%). Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of african children and sickle-cell disease. In a child with fever and bone pain, especially if elevation of acute phase reactants, we should consider OA and perform a MRI.",

P r e -p r o t o c o l , 5 / 6 w e r e t r e a t e d w i t h Immunoglobulin (Ig) and 2/6 with corticosteroids; Post-protocol, all patients were treated with Ig; Two repeated Ig, due to clinical worsening. 9/10 had complete recovery and one abandoned the follow-up, with partial areflexia after three months. Conclusion: According to the protocol, corticosteroids are contraindicated and weren't used on any patient from the second group. With atypical symptoms, LP and EMG can be helpful. Almost all patients had total recovery of the symptoms, which is frequent in children. The protocol permits a more uniformized approach to GBS. Background: Cervical lymphadenopathies are a common occurrence among children. They are often associated with an infectious process and can be caused by multiple pathogens. Identifying an etiology can be challenging, as well as choosing the appropriate treatment. Case Report 1: 11-month-old girl with a 2 days complaint of limitation of neck movement, without fever or other symptoms. She presented with voluminous and hardened bilateral cervical tumefaction despite having a good general appearance. Blood tests showed leukocytosis and a high C-reactive protein. Cervical ultrasound revealed unspecific features and the neck CT exhibited numerous reactive adenomegalies, the largest one with necrotic center. She started antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, clindamycin and azithromycin. Even so, she developed fever that lasted 10 days. Case Report 2: 10-month-old girl with a 9 days history of left submandibular growing mass, with no history of fever or any other symptoms. Physical examination identified a palpable indurated left submandibular mass. Cervical ultrasound revealed findings consistent with bilateral adenitis. Blood work revealed leukocytosis and a high C-reactive protein.",

            "text": "She started amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithromycin. She developed fever from day 1 until day 3. Etiological investigation was negative for both patients, including EBV, CMV, Bartonella, Toxoplasmosis and tuberculosis, as well as blood cultures. After more than 15 days without clinical improvement, they underwent surgical drainage of the lymph node, and bacteriologic exam of pus identified a Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive for the antibiotics used empirically). Conclusion: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implied on lymphadenitis. Generally, there is a sudden onset of inflammatory signs, with appearance of poorly mobile cervical lymphadenopathies. About 30% of the infected nodes suppurate within two weeks. With these cases we pretend to emphasize that treatment of Staphylococcus aureus lymphadenitis can be difficult, even when appropriate antibiotics are used resulting in a n eed for surgical drainage. Introduction: Mastitis is uncommon in pediatrics and can be associated with breast abscess. In young nulliparous women there is a causal relationship with smoking habits, due to ductal and periductal inflammation. Disease severity and invasion is higher in the presence of risk factors such as cystic breast lesions. Clinical severity and treatment resistance results from poor penetration of antibiotics into breast tissue. Case report: 17-year-old adolescent, nulliparous, menarche at age 12, with regular menses and not on oral contraceptive medication. Denied tobacco or other consumptions but exposed to second-hand smoke since early childhood. History of breast asymmetry since puberty, with an epidermoid cyst in her right breast diagnosed at 16 years of age. The patient presented acutely to the emergency department in March 2018, with painless heat and swelling of the right breast. Physical examination revealed a firm and well-defined tumefaction of the right breast, painful on palpation. No axillary lymph nodes were palpable. Breast ultrasound was performed due to the adolescent's medical history and breast inflammatory signs, which revealed a 13mm epidermoid cyst with adjacent fat densification and fluid collection suggestive of mastitis. Started on oral flucloxacillin, the lesion presented a slow and gradual, however incomplete, reduction in size and inflammatory signs, with resolution only after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment and surgical drainage. Discussion: We present this case report as it is uncommon for a nulliparous adolescent to develop mastitis, thus considering the likely impact of second-hand smoke on its pathogenesis, as active smoking is considered a major risk factor for breast inflammatory lesions. In conclusion, we emphasize how tobacco exposure not only has a role on the development of comorbilities such as lung cancer and chronic pulmonary disease, but also other less frequent but equally severe pathological conditions in younger age groups, reinforcing smoke-free environments for children. Background: Recent studies indicate that HHV-6 and HHV-7 may trigger some neurological disorders. Methods: We detected HHV-6 and HHV-7 in 121 samples of clinical material (serum, peripheral blood cells, urine, saliva/buccal swabs, and CSF) from 31 patients with the following clinical diagnoses: encephalitis/meningoencephalitis, febrile seizures, epilepsy, children with unspecified febrile fever, psychotic disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome.Qualitative detection of HHV-6 DNAwas carried out by real-time PCR with a commercial kit, and HHV-7 primers and probe (Wada et al., 2009) were used for detection of HHV-7 DNA. Results: HHV-6 DNA was found in 6.45% patients (2 of 31): in saliva, cells and urine (n=1), in cells and serum (n=1). HHV-7 DNAwe detected in 12.9% patients (4 of 31): in CSF with blood (n=1), in saliva and urine (n=1), in cells and saliva (n=1), in cells and CSF (n=1). Both HHV-6 and HHV-7 were found in 25.8% patients (8 of 31): 3 of them had both viruses in saliva, 1in blood cells; in other 4 children roseoloviruses were detected in variants -HHV-6+ HHV-7 in saliva and HHV-7 in blood cells, HHV-6 in saliva and HHV-7 in cells, HHV-6 in urine and HHV-6+HHV-7 in buccal swabs, HHV-6+HHV-7 in saliva and HHV-7 in CSF and urine.The quantity of HHV-6 in urine was Conclusion: Roseoloviruses are often detected in the clinical material of patients with neurological disorders. This can't indicate its etiopathogenic role, since persistent carriage of latent roseoloviruses occurs in healthy controls. This requires further research. Introduction and Objectives: Brucellosis is a worldwide zoonosis which is currently in clear regression in Europe. In Spain, the incidence has been decreasing since 1990, although some human cases persist. The historical importance of this disease and the current lack of experience on its management, make us present this retrospective study. The objective of our study is to assess the clinical validation of diagnostic tests performed in pediatric patients with brucellosis. Methods: Retrospective study of 13 pediatric patients diagnosed from 1989 to 2018 (30 years), in two hospitals of Madrid province. The cases have been identified from the registries of Microbiology Services, hospital admissions and outpatient clinics. Results: Cases were diagnosed from 1992 to 2003. All patients except of one, recognized consumption of not pasteurized milk products. Twelve out of thirteen patients presented arthralgias and / or arthritis; the most frequent locations were hip and sacroiliac joints. The median duration was 20 days for joint symptoms and 18 days for fever (median maximum temperature 38.7\u00b0C). The diagnosis was initially carried out wtih Rose Bengal test in all patients (100% positive). Table 1 shows results of main diagnostic tests.",

Serological tests were positive in all cases. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein were near normal in most patients. Blood cultures and bone scintigraphy were useful diagnostic tools in half of the patients. Background and Aims: Streptococcus pyogenes is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia(CAP) in children, but it seems to have increased in the last years. It is associated with severe disease, including longer duration of fever and hospital stay, development of complications (nectrotizing pneumonia, bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome) and larger pleural effusions, with higher rates of bacterial isolation in pleural fluid, compared with other bacteria. The aim of this study is to review the clinical aspects of S. pyogenes-CAP diagnosed in in our hospital during the last two decades. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of pediatric inpatients with S. pyogenes-CAP in the period 2000-2019. Results: We included 21 patients (16 boys and 5 girls), median age [interquartile range-IQR] at diagnosis was 25 [20-43] months. Yearly distribution of cases is shown in Figure 1 . Median hospital stay [IQR] was 22 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] days. A total of 17 patients (80%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (median [IQR] stay 4 [2-8] days). All patients but two developed pleural effusion that required chest tube insertion. Sixteen patients (76%) required respiratory support. Pleural fluid culture was positive in 17/18 (94%). Blood cultures were positive in 6/20 (30%). Twelve patients out of 21 (57%) had positive viral detections in nasopharyngeal aspirates (identified by multiplex PCR), being influenza the most frequent one (5 cases). Regarding complications, 8 patients (38%) developed necrotizing pneumonia, 9 (43%) had hemodynamic instability and 5 (23%) toxic shock syndrome. All patients received intravenous antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics with complete resolution.",

            "text": "We have observed an increase in the number of cases of S. pyogenes-CAP in the last years. Most patients were preschoolers with severe pneumonia and pleural effusion. These infections require prolonged hospital stay and frequent Intensive Care Unit admission, as complications occur often. However, all patients achieved a full recovery. Background: Currently, Portugal presents low risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In 2014, the incidence of the disease reached the limit of low incidence (20/100,000 inhabitants) that remains until the present time. In 2016, BCG vaccination strategy was changed from a universal strategy to selective (risk groups). Objective: Case report of a 17-year-old adolescent with iron deficiency anaemia, who had been medicated for 3 months with oral iron, that went to urgency due to night-time holocranial headache that interfered with sleep associated with photophobia, phonophobia and night fever. He presented with anorexia, asthenia and weight loss of 8 Kg with 1 month of evolution. At admission, a decrease in the vesicular murmur in the right pulmonary base was identified. He did not present alterations in the neurological examination, namely meningeal signs. The blood count did not reveal changes and the inflammatory parameters were negative. A chest X-ray revealed small pleural effusion on the right. CT of the chest and molecular research of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in respiratory secretions were requested. He was hospitalized for an etiological study. An infectious context with risk contact was identified: the patient`s mother had a chronic cough with 1 year of evolution and a maternal uncle had recently been hospitalized for pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient under study would have been called for tuberculosis screening but did not attend. In day 5 of hospitalization, for maintenance of intense headache with little relapse to the therapy of relief, and appearance of stiffness of the neck, a lumbar puncture was performed that allowed identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by the DNA PCR technique. Conclusion: Tuberculosis meningitis is a rare disease with a challenging diagnosis due to its insidious evolution. Targeted treatment should be initialized as soon as possible. ",

Objective: To reveal the importance of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the diagnosis of bone tuberculosis. Methods: A case report of a teenager with bone tuberculosis Results: A 17-year-old Somalian boy without medical history was referred to our pediatric department with a 3-month history of fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dysphagia to solids and serious anorexia. Refugee, his BCG vaccination status was unknown. He appeared unwell with dyspnea class II NYHA, bilateral inguinal and cervical painless lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary auscultation found decreased breath sounds on right lung. The Creactive protein level was 57.4mg/L. The thoracic computed tomography (CT) found medium lobar consolidation with right-sided pleural nodules and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. An abdominopelvic CT scan confirmed a 6-centimeter abscess in the spinal canal (T11-T12) and a 2-centimeter cystic lesion in the left iliac crest. QuantiFERON was positive. Neither a tuberculin purified protein derivative test nor a chest XR were performed. Expectorated sputum and gastric catheterization showed no sign of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT). First bone biopsy under local anesthesia failed due to pain and lack of patient cooperation. Meanwhile symptoms worsened. Any movement of the left hip became unbearable especially at night and while exercising. Lumbar spine and pelvic MRI revealed spondylitis involving T12, cold epidural and paravertebral abscess with compression sign and a cystic lesion of the right-sided sacrum. As the neurological exam was normal, no surgical decompression was recommended. A second biopsy was scheduled under general anesthesia. PCR confirmed MT, sensitive to rifampin. The patient regained normal function within a month. Conclusion: PCR was very useful for the diagnosis of bone tuberculosis of a spinal lesion.",

            "text": "Background: Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation and fluid collection within the prepatellar bursa, typically due to trauma and less frequently related to infection, leading to septic bursitis. It is an extremely rare condition in the pediatric population. Case Report: An 11-year-old obese girl presented to the emergency department reporting fever and an erythematous, swollen, and painful right knee following a trauma four days earlier. Two days before, she had been evaluated by an orthopedist who diagnosed a post-traumatic prepatellar bursitis. On admission she had normal vital signs, difficulty in gait and a knee with signs of inflammation and tender to palpation. There were insect bites in the skin overlying the area. Blood tests revealed: white cell count 13,6x10 9 /L, neutrophils 66,3%, sedimentation rate 52mm/h and C-reactive protein 17,2mg/dL. There were an increased volume of the soft tissue anterior to the patella at the x-ray. She was hospitalized and 24 hours later spontaneously drained purulent and serohematic content through a blister with 7 cm in diameter and the wound was cleaned. The ultrasonography showed a superficial abscess with a fistula to the exterior, with no intra-articular extension. The culture of bursal fluid revealed a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. She completed 7 days of endovenous flucloxacillin at the hospital and another 7 days orally at home. She had a favorable evolution, with no long-term complications. Conclusion: If not treated correctly, septic bursitis can result in osteomyelitis with bone destruction. Early diagnosis with Gram staining and imaging is essential both to provide early adequate treatment and to exclude joint or bone involvement. Background: Typhoid fever inflicts a significant burden of disease in endemic areas. While generally manifesting at a later course, multiorgan complications may occur prematurely. Typhoid delirium state, also known as typhoid encephalopathy or typhoid toxemia, is the most common and yet, under-recognized neurological complication. Objective: To underline the challenges of diagnosing a severe typhoid fever with neurological complications in a limited resource setting. Methods: A case of severe typhoid fever with early-onset neurological manifestations, initially suspected of acute psychosis, in a local low-resource private hospital in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia is presented. A 15-year-old undernourished boy presented with incoherent speech, generalized weakness, and disorganized behavior since the preceding 4 days. Previously, he had had headache and fever, followed by a seizure. An unidentified medication was administered a day earlier. Previously, he had always been a normal kid. Upon examination, he appeared delirious, with unremarkable physical examination. Widal test discovered S. typhi O and H titres of 1:320 and 1:160 respectively, with normal results of other feasible blood tests. A diagnosis of severe typhoid fever with neurological manifestation was decided. As his consciousness had not improved by third day of admission despite adequate antibiotics, antipsychotic medication was administered. The next day he was completely alert and subsequently discharged. Follow-up at the clinic 2 weeks post-discharge revealed reemerging neurologic symptoms subsequent to discontinuation of antipsychotic medication for 8 days. Repeat Widal test showed S. typhi O titre of 1:320 and negative S.typhi H titre. He was then diagnosed with typhoid carrier with a sequelae of typhoid delirium state. Despite being completely alert, he suffered from mild cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Careful evaluation is needed in patients with altered mental status to discover underlying causes, including typhoid fever. Furthermore, typhoid fever's neurological complications may exhibit early, hence prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. Meningeal tuberculosis (MTB) is particularly frequent in children less than five years old and it is often overlooked due to non-specific symptoms. The Portuguese annual incidence of MTB in children aged under five years was less than 1:10.000.000 inhabitants (2011 -2016). An 18-month-old girl was admitted due to poor feeding and lethargy, with a four-month history of intermittent fever, enlarged cervical lymph nodes and weight loss. Primary care follow-up was maintained by different general practitioners. She had not been immunized with BCG vaccine. Cranial CT scan displayed normal ventricular size and lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis, p o l y m o r p h o n u c l e a r n e u t r o p h i l s p r e d o m i n a n c e a n d hypoglycorrhachia. Empirical treatment for CNS infection was initiated and she was transferred to our tertiary hospital. Due to clinical suspicion of MTB, tuberculostatic therapy (four-drug regimen) was initiated within 24 hours, as well as adjunctive therapy with glucocorticoids. Over the next 48 hours, she presented tonic-clonic seizures and progressive impaired consciousness. Repeated CT scan revealed hydrocephalus requiring admission in intensive care unit for external ventricular drain (EVD). Subsequent MRI revealed a large vessel vasculitis. Positive results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were obtained by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and by PCR in CSF, bronchoalveolar lavage and gastric aspirate specimens. Chest CT scan exhibited a miliary pattern. Prompt screening of household contacts identified the index-case (her father) in collaboration with public health department. Rapid progression of vasculitis lead to refractory intracranial hypertension with need of decompressive hemicraniectomy. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was necessary due to unsuccessful EVD removal. She maintained severe neurologic deficits on oneyear follow-up. In the reported case, stage of disease at presentation and complications (especially cerebral vasculitis) were possibly the major determinants of neuropsychomotor sequelae. It is of paramount importance recognizing early MTB stages for prompt management. Screening close contacts is vital, reinforcing the need of optimizing collaboration with public health departments.",

            "text": "Tick borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a spirochete infection and is characterized mainly by recurring episodes of fever. Our objective was to characterize pediatric TBRF in comparison to adult TBRF. Data from the medical records of all patients diagnosed with TBRF in the 3 largest hospitals in Jerusalem, Israel, between the years 2004-2018 were collected and analyzed. During the study period, 92 patients were diagnosed with TBRF of whom 21 (22.8%) were children. Children had longer periods of fever compared to adults: 15.6 (\u00b110.5) VS 7.9 (\u00b19.9) days (p0.01) and had 2.2 (\u00b11.3) VS 0.6 (\u00b10.8) relapses of fever at presentation. Children had a lower neutrophil count (4.8\u00b12.7 *10 9 /liter VS 7\u00b12.9 *10 9 / liter; P0.01) and lower C-reactive protein levels (8.1\u00b14.3 mg/dl VS 15.6 \u00b110.1 mg/dl; P0.01). In conclusion, children exhibited a distinctly different course of TBRF, characterized by more episodes of fever and lower levels of inflammatory markers. Objective: The aim of study is an early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic intervention of sepsis during the critical first hour of develop the clinical signs in paediatric patients , is crucial to stop progression into severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: We investigated 350 patiens with clinical signs suspected for sepsis in the Univetsity Children Hospital-Skopje. The new multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based rapid diagnostic test (BioFire FilmAray Blood Culture Identification (BCID) was used for early recognition of 27 targets of sepsis, 24 pathogenes and 3 antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, blaKPC, and Van A/VanB), associated with bloodstream infection sample 200ul from positive blood culture detected on BACT/ALERT 3D 60. The result report indicating the detected microorganism is obtained after 60 minutes. Results: We detected 51 positive blood culture, 30 were single blood culture isolate. Twenty eight of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which twenty five were methicillin resistant, two were Streptococcus pneumonia. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Twelve of the isolates were Gram negative bacteria, seven were Seratia marcescens, five were Enterobacteriae. Nine had two or three bacteria at the same time. Rapid diagnosis of the causing microorganism and relevant resistance determinants is important for early administration and modification of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as well as reduced antimicrobial resistance selection. Conclusion: FilmAray Blood Cell Identification quickly identifies the pathogen in the blood culture of pediatric patients with suspected sepsis, a short time to the results can be of added value to optimize the clinical management of patients, improves the outcome of the potential complications for severe sepsis and septic shock and reduces hospital treatment costs. Background: Kawasaki disease (KD), a vasculitis of unknown etiology, is an important cause of prolonged fever in childhood. Fever lasting more than five days and at least four signs of mucocutaneous inflammation characterize it. It's main complication are coronary artery aneurysms being the primary cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. Case-report: A 22-month-old girl is admitted to our hospital with a persistent fever for eight days accompanied by a generalized maculopapular exanthema that affected palms, to which bilateral cervical adenopathies are associated at the sixth day of disease. The serial investigational tests performed revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and a reactive-C protein maximum 26,5 mg/dL and she was medicated with amoxicillin for the suspicion of an occult bacteremia, without improvement. At admission she fulfilled three clinical criteria for KD and the remainder laboratory results supported the diagnosis: a normocytic normochromic anemia (minimum of 7,4 g/dL) and hypoalbuminemia (minimum of 2,8 g/dL). The urinary exam, chest radiography and blood cultures were negative. An echocardiogram was performed revealing a dilation of the anterior descendent coronary artery (Z-score +2,35). She was administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in a single dose of 2g/kg and initiated aspirin in an anti-inflammatory dosage. After the initial clinical improvement the fever reappeared in two days. She repeated the administration of IVIG without improvement. At the tenth day of hospitalization she initiated methylprednisolone pulses for three days, with resolution of the fever and progressive clinical improvement. She was discharged with an overlapping echocardiographic assessment and antiplatelet dosage aspirin. Conclusion: The diagnosis of incomplete KD may be a clinical challenge especially in the first 24 months of life. With this report we aim to alert to the differential diagnosis of a child with fever of unknown origin and the importance of the echocardiographic assessment in the diagnostic evaluation. Background: Among children under five years old, pneumonia is still one of the leading cause of mortality globally and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) is one of the most common causative agent for bacterial pneumonia. Locally, the Expanded Programme for Immunization included Hib vaccination given for free in health centers. Data on clinical outcome of pneumonia after widespread use of Hibvaccination is important to document its protective effect against pneumonia and in improving its management. Objective: To describe the prevalence of PCAP C and D among patients aged 6 months to 5 years admitted from June 2016 to June 2017, who had received Hib vaccinations. Materials and Methods: Retrospective, descriptive study done in a tertiary government hospital. Results: Among the children admitted for PCAP C and D from June 2016 to June 2017, 22% received at least one dose of Hib vaccination with majority (56.3%) aged 6 months -12 months, mostly male. As to the Hib immunization status, 10.4%, 19.4% and 70.1% received 1, 2, and 3 doses of Hib vaccination respectively and none received a booster dose.The mean length of hospital stay for the patients vary.Complications were notably decreased in those who received Hib vaccine. Conclusion: The prevalence of PCAP C and D among patients was comparable to other studies, with Hib vaccine providing a protective effect for PCAP C and D as the number of given dose increases. The mortality and complications in these group of populations were observed to be low. Background: Odontogenic infection is a polymicrobial infection with different degrees of clinical severity. It is the most common type of oral infection and its treatment involves up to 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions leading to important costs in public health, parents and school absenteeism, loss of quality of life and miss of dental pieces. The costs of this evitable health problem are high. Objective: The purposes of this study were to retrospectively assess characteristics of pediatric patients with odontogenic-based facial cellulitis that needed in-hospital treatment and describe management in a suburban Hospital in Portugal. Methods: Data from clinical records of 34 patients who were admitted for in-hospital treatment of orofacial infection at the pediatric department from January 2015 to May 2019. Medical records were reviewed for all patients with a discharge diagnosis of facial cellulitis and tooth decay or buccal cellulitis. Results: Thirty-four patient records were reviewed, 50% girls with a mean age of 11 years (4-17 years). The mean length of stay was six days. Thirteen of the patients had, at least, one parent with economic insufficiency. In 62% antibiotic treatment was started prior to admission. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics was needed in 94% of them, twothirds using two or more different antibiotics. Cooperation with other specialities was frequent, mainly Stomatology (22 out of 34). Conclusion: Tooth decay is a major public health problem and it's a target of health programs. Nevertheless, many children and adolescents do not use these programs maintaining high incidence of dental abscesses that motivate hospital admission. There is a need for more motivation and information for parents and children regarding this important public health issue.",

            "text": "Background: Herpetic whitlow is a rare cause of finger infection most commonly affecting children. It is a type 1 or 2 Herpes simplex virus infection characterized by significant pain and erythema with overlying non-purulent vesicles. Herpetic whitlow should be suspected based on clinical signs. It is caused by inoculation of the virus through a break in the skin barrier. Eczema and other skin lesions can increase the risk of its appearance. Case Presentation: We report a case of a previously healthy 16-year-old male adolescent admitted to the hospital with erythema and swelling of the fingers of his both hands. The right fifth finger was very painful and showed, in terminal phalanx, grouped vesicular lesions with clear fluid and surrounding erythema; along multiple other fingers of both hands he showed dyshidrotic eczema lesions. No treatment was applied in the right fifth finger as the diagnosis of herpetic whitlow was assumed. Dyshidrotic eczema finger lesions were treated with topical corticosteroids. At ten-day follow up all skin lesions resolved completely. There were no previously history of herpetic infection and there were no recurrences in the next ten months. Conclusion: We draw attention to the typical clinical signs and correct management of herpetic whitlow as it may go underdiagnosed and its appearance may mimic a bacterial infection. Treatment is usually symptomatic as lesions are self-limited and unnecessary surgical interventions should be avoided since they can exacerbate symptoms or lead to complications. Background: Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a common infectious disease, caused by Bartonella Henselae, typically characterized by self-limited regional lymphadenopathy. CSD rarely causes disseminated illness, like hepatosplenic disease. Hereditary spherocytosis' (HS) presentation can vary from mild to severe depending on the degree of haemolysis and complications. HS can remain undetected until challenge by an infectious illness. Case Report: A previously healthy 6-year-old boy, with family history of spherocytosis and exposure to cats, presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of fever, right cervical lymphadenomegaly, nonspecific rash, jaundice and choluria. He was previously medicated with amoxicillin/ clavulanate for adenitis and suspected streptococcal tonsillitis. Laboratory test revealed: haemoglobin 11.1 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume 88 fl; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 37.2 g/dL; reticulocytosis 0.21x10^6/uL; peripheral blood smear (PBS) with anisocytosis, toxic granulation and vacuolated neutrophils; C-reactive protein 1.17 mg/dL; hyperbilirubinemia (direct 3.21 mg/dL; indirect 5.28 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase 117 U/L; alanine aminotransferase 227 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase 578 U/L. Ultrasonography revealed mild splenomegaly and no parenchymal liver changes or structural cause of obstructive cholestasis. During hospital stay, there was an improvement in symptoms with supportive treatment followed by decreasing levels of aminotransferases and bilirubin. Serologic testing for putative infectious agents were negative. He was discharged four days later, asymptomatic. Post-discharge results were positive for Bartonella henselae IgM titers. No specific treatment was prescribed since the patient was asymptomatic by the time of results. Further studies on suspected spherocytosis were performed at a tertiary hospital. Discussion: We considered a diagnosis of acute hepatitis due to infection of Bartonella Henselae, according to laboratory results, lymphadenomegaly and exposure to cats. Although there were no red blood cell abnormalities in PBS, HS is suspected because of a positive family history, increased MCHC and hemolysis. Background: Childhood tuberculosis remains a common and often fatal vaccine preventable disease worldwide. At this point of time, there is limited data available on tuberculosis among Malaysian paediatrics population. The present study is designed to analyse the spectrum of the disease and demographic patterns of affected children. This is a retrospective study is conducted among paediatric population seen in University Malaya Medical Centre from 2008 -2017. Objectives: To describe the spectrum of paediatric tuberculous (TB) disease in UMMC. To describe the demographic characteristics of children diagnosed with tuberculosis. Methods: This is a retrospective, cross -sectional descriptive study on all paediatrics patients who were diagnosed with TB in UMMC over period of ten years from January 2008 until December 2017. All patients were identified through records obtained from attendance to DOTS clinic, Paediatric Infectious Disease clinic, and Ministry of Health CDCIS eNotifikasi website. Results: There were a total of 156 (75.4%) eligible candidates recruited into the study; 102 (65.4%) and 54 (34.6%) patients in the confirmed TB and clinical compatible TB groups respectively. The majority of affected patients predominantly were female (n=91; 58.3%). Paediatric population aged between 12 to 18 years of age contributed the higher number of patients (n=99). In terms of ethnic groups Malays (n=92) were predominantly affected followed by Indians (n=27) and Chinese (n=25). The pulmonary TB is the commonest form of the TB spectrum followed by extrapulmonary, and miliary / disseminated TB. Conclusion: Children and adolescents who were exposed to TB patients should be screened so that early detection and intervention could be carried out. Tuberculosis in paediatric population has specific characteristics that are important to understand for health personnel working in clinical medicine. Pulmonary TB is still the commonest form tuberculosis in children. Background: Group A streptococci (GAS) infections of the central nervous system are extremely rare in the antibiotic era, accounting for less than 1% of all childhood meningitis. However, in the last decades, recent reports suggest an increase in invasive SGA infections. Case Presentation Summary: The authors present a case of a 3-year-old boy admitted to the emergency room, with a history of high fever, cough, vomiting and lethargy. He had been diagnosed with varicella 5 days before and medicated with acyclovir. On examination, he presented paleness, positive Kernig`s and Brudzinski`s sign, and nuchal rigidity. He also had several crusted lesions spread across the whole body and some petechiae. Vital signs were normal. Laboratory tests results showed a white blood cell count of 17.1\u00d710^9/L (82% neutrophils, 11.4% lymphocytes and 6% monocytes) and a C-reactive protein of 212 mg/l. Lumbar puncture revealed a nucleated cell count of 27cel/mm 3 , a protein of 36.9mg/dL and a glucose of 80mg/dL. Therapy with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started. Twenty-four hours later, GAS was isolated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Antibiotics were switched to IV penicillin G and clindamycin. The patient was discharged after 16 days. He was asymptomatic, with no sequelae. Learning Points/Discussion: In paediatric patients, varicella is a welldocumented risk factor for invasive GAS, associated with approximately 15% to 30% of such infections. Post-varicella GAS meningitis has rarely been reported and it seems to be related to skin lesions. However the pathogenesis of GAS meningitis has not been entirely explained. Introduction: Deep cervical spaces infections are rare entities in pediatric age and may be associated with significant percentages of morbidity and mortality. Case Presentation Summary: We present the case of a four-yearold girl, previously healthy, admitted to our emergency room with a 3 days history of neck pain and fever. She had odynophagia and fever, two weeks before. Physical examination showed tenderness of the cervical region, without trismus, and bilateral cervical infracentimetric adenopathies. Otoscopy showed signs of acute otitis media on the right and serous otitis on the left, hyperemia and tonsillar hypertrophy with tonsillar exudate. On blood analysis presented leukocytosis, neutrophilia and Creactive protein 79 mg / L. She started intravenous (IV) antibiotics with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. During the hospitalization a cervical ultrasound revealed an increase in the echogenicity of the adipose planes of the right carotid space (RCS), a finding that led to a cervical CT scan, which showed a liquid collection at the level of the upper third of the RCS, with 25x15 mm compatible with abscess, with significant reduction of the right carotid artery diameter. Significant clinical improvement was observed after she started IV antibiotis, but due to the location of the abscess and the absence of improvement in the imaging tests, methylprednisolone IV was started and the patient was transferred to a Central Hospital. During hospitalization clindamycin was added to the therapeutic scheme, with progressive improvement and without the need for surgical drainage.",

It has a wide spectrum of manifestations including Kawasaki disease, erythema multiforme, Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae induced rash and mucositis (MIRM). The authors' objective was to illustrate two possible presentations of MIRM. Case description: Case 1: Female, 15-years-old, was admitted to the emergency room with diffuse ulcerations of the oral mucosa (lips, palate and gums) partially covered by hemorrhagic crusts, as well as conjunctiva's erythema. During the previous month, she presented nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and cough. No fever and no cutaneous involvement. Complementary exams included a chest X-ray consistent with an atypical pneumonia, negative DNA protein chain reaction but the serum enzyme immunoassay revealed a positive M. pneumoniae IgM. Case 2: Male 17-years-old, presented to the emergency room with a 7-days history of fever, cough and rhinorrhea. One day before to the admission, he developed edema and painful erosions of the oral mucosa, purulent bilateral conjunctivitis and minor urethral meatus erythema. Absence of cutaneous involvement. Chest Xray was consistent with an atypical pneumonia and the DNA protein chain reaction was positive for M. pneumoniae; the enzyme immunoassay is in progress. Both were treated with a 3-days azithromycin and supportive care and pain management. Following presented a noticeable clinical improvement and favorable prognosis. Discussion/Conclusion: The MIRM was described as a new entity with mucosal findings consistent with SJS, but without or sparse cutaneous involvement, preceded by a recognized M. pneumoniae infection. These cases evidence clinical and diagnostic features previously described in MIRM which include a predominance of two or more mucosal sites, relatively sparse cutaneous involvement and evidence of an atypical infection. An accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance for the correct management and prognosis.",

The clinical presentation in humans ranges from a mild flu-like illness to a severe illness with jaundice, meningitis, renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage. Epstein-Barr virus can induce complex humoral and cellmediated immune responses in humans, which impair liver function, we describe and adult girl with leptospirosis associated with active EBV infection. Case Report: A 14-year-old girl was admitted because of a 1-week history of general malaise. Lymphadenophaty no history of travel and had not taken any medicine in the previous weeks. The patient's body temperature was 39\u00b0C, blood pressure was 110/ 70mmHg normal HR and normal RR. his skin and sclera were icteric, cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Laboratory leukocytosis with high atypical lymphocytes, no anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme abnormality and cholestatic jaundice, normal renal function. Abdominal sonography showed mild splenomegaly without other specific findings. The patient was treated with parenteral ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Serum antibodies against hepatitis A and serum surface antigen of hepatitis B were negative. EBV serum immunoglobin IgG and IgM were positive. PCR in urine for leptospira was positive. Cystitis Cystica in Children In general, the diagnosis is initially based on clinical suspicion, and is confirmed later by laboratory results, usually by the detection of PCR IN URINE. The coinfection with EBV attributable to immunosuppression caused by active EBV infection, and increased the chance of hepatitis and another symptoms of liptospera. Introduction: Henoch-Schonlein-purpura is a systemic vasculitis, of small vessels, resulting in skin, joint, gastrointestinal and renal involvement. The pathogenesis of HSP t is postulated that an unknown chronic antigenic stimulus, In children the prognosis is good, as HSP typically resolves rapidly and without complication. Helicobacter pylori is of the most common bacterial infections may cause some extra intestinal manifestations some of which are dermatological conditions, including Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura. Case Report: A previously healthy 10year-child was admitted to our department , because of-week history of abdominal pain, and purpura on his lower extensor extremities. Physical examination revealed purpuric papules, on the legs, thighs, buttocks,. On admission, his temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, , and blood pressure 110/60 mmHg. showed a white blood cell count of 18200/mm 3 . The hemoglobin concentration was 11.8g/dL, the platelet count was 400000, while normal results for serum creatinine level Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and proteinuria 200 mg/24 hrs). Occult blood was found in the feces., breath test for H. pylori showed a positive result. the patient received a two-week treatment course consisting of omepradex+, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin without steroid treatment. After the treatment, the abdominal manifestations dramatically subsided within three days and the purpuric skin lesions resolve. Conclusion: H.pylori infection has been associated with certain extradigestive dermatological conditions, including chronic urticaria, systemic sclerosis, and atopic dermatitis The symptoms of HSP disappeared after H. Pylori eradication therapy, In conclusion, H. pylori may be an etiological factor in pathogenesis of HSP and breath test fo H. pylori examination should be considered. Summary: The results of the monitoring the child with contamination of tick bite during the spring-autumn of 2018 in Ternopil and Ternopil region were summarized, according to which the peak of such lesions occurred in May-June and August-September. It was found that the percentage of ticks infected with pathogens of infectious diseases, namely Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, was about 37%. There were cases where the ticks were infected with multiple pathogens (B. burgdorferi s.l. with A. Phagocytophilum, B. miyamotoi and A. rhagocytophilum) simultaneously. Regarding the importance of different stages of the tick Ixodes ricinus in the transmission of infectious agents, it has been shown that a greater number of vaccinated individuals were among females and nymphs. Although the role of males and larvae in this process can not be ruled out either. There were 47 females, 76 nymphs, 1 male and 4 larvae among 128 infectes ticks. Clinical trials of children affected by ticks have shown that the most common initial manifestation of Lime borreliosis is a typical skin disorders, known such as erythema migrans. The necessity of appointing preventive treatment of Lyme borreliosis in children who have been exposed to ticks has been proved.",

            "text": "The survey included all paediatric inpatients receiving an antimicrobial on the day of PPS. Data included details on antimicrobial agents, reasons and indications for treatment and a set of quality indicators. A web-based application was used for data-entry, validation and reporting as designed by the University of Antwerp, Belgium (www.global-pps.com). Because of the different hospitals included, merged results are presented. Results: In total 20 paediatric wards with 250 inpatients were surveyed of which 61.4% admitted to hospitals in Tbilisi. Overall antimicrobial prevalence was 84.6% with highest rates found in paediatric medical wards (63.1%) and neonatal intensive care units (20.0%). The most frequent indications for antimicrobial use were pneumonia (44.8%, 101 patients). In total 223 antibacterials for systemic use (ATC J01) were prescribed of which ceftriaxone accounted for 35.5%, followed by ampicillin/sulbactam (20.4%) and azithromycin (16.0%). Out of all patients treated for pneumonia, 14.8% got meropenem. Out of all patients on surgical prophylaxis for the gastrointestinal tract, 76.0% received ceftriaxone, 84% used more than 3 day. With respect to antimicrobial quality indicators, the reason in notes was documented in 81.7%; a stop review date in 18.2%. Guidelines were missing in 9.7% and overall compliance to antibiotic guidelines was 90.2%. Empiric therapy was most common (92.8%). In 88.4% of patients CRP was used for treatment decision making. Conclusions: The high prevalence of overall antibiotic use, particularly ceftriaxone and meropenem, the irrational antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery and the high rate of empirical therapy are worrisome findings. Application of CRP for decision making indicates an attempt of rational antibiotic use. It is reasonable to set up feasible antimicrobial stewardship interventions to enhance appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Background: Leukemoid reaction (white blood cells [WBC] of 30000/mL or more) is rare in children and adolescents. It is commonly associated with infections and may indicate serious conditions. There is a lack of data regarding the underlying causes and the necessary work-up. Objective: Investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of children and adolescents with leukemoid reaction. Methods: Retrospective study consulting the clinical files of children and adolescents (1 month to 17 years old) presenting with WBC of 30000/mL or more, in a second level hospital, in 2017. Demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed. Results: A total of 29 patients were included, aged between 3 months and 9.7 years (median 1.6 years), with equal gender distribution. The majority (65.5%) were previously healthy. Fever was present in 79.3% (31% on the first day; 17.2% on the second; 13.8% on the third) and vomiting in 41.1%. The WBC count ranged from 30000 to 56100/mL (mean 34628/mL; neutrophilia was predominant in 93.1%, lymphocytosis in 6.9%) and reactive-C protein ranged from 0.5 to 38.8 mg/dL (mean 10.3 mg/dL). The most common diagnosis were: pneumonia (17.2%), vomiting (17.2%), skin and soft tissue infection (13.8%), urinary tract infection (10.3%) and others (febrile conv u l s i o n , a c u t e o t i t i s m e d i a , a d e n o i d i t i s , t o n s i l l i t i s , mononucleosis-like illness, appendicitis). In seven cases, viral etiology was likely. Sixty-two percent were hospitalized, with a median hospitalization length of three days. Antibiotic therapy was performed in 65.5%. Four of the urine cultures were positive (4/15, mostly Escherichia coli). All the blood (n=18) and cerebrospinal fluid (n=2) cultures were sterile. There were no cases of hemato-oncological disease, glucocorticoid administrations or polyethylene glycol intoxications. Conclusion: Fever and/or vomiting were present in a significant number of leukemoid reactions. Almost two-thirds were hospitalized and treated with antibiotic. Leukemoid reactions in healthy children can be related to benign and common diseases as we find in our study. Background: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a significant issue in febrile young patients because it may cause harm irreversible complications in kidneys. Early detection of urinary tract infection is crucial. Urinary culture is a gold standard to diagnose UTI, but it takes time. Clinical predictors are needed to predict UTI. Objective: To find clinical predictors that can predict UTI. Methods: We analyzed the registry of pediatric febrile patients less than 24 months of age collected in two pediatric emergency departments from Aug. 2016 to Feb. 2018. UTI was defined as 5 X 10 4 in urine culture with bacteriuria or pyuria according to AAP criteria. Viral infection (VI) is defined as the case in which the bacterial infection is clearly not detected through the medical records and laboratory tests among the patients who were discharged with the diagnosis of viral infection. We analyzed the difference in demographic and clinical findings and performed a logistic regression analysis. Results: There were 1003 (74.2%) patients in VI group and 348 (25.8%) patients in UTI group. UTI group had more males, younger, had a history of renal diseases, and had fewer rashes. There was no significant difference on body temperature, but fever duration of UTI group was shorter than that of VI group (31.7 \u00b1 34.1 hours vs. 37.8 \u00b1 47.2 hours, p=0.03). The logistic regression revealed that the likelihood of UTI was greater in men, when less than 12 months of age, when the amount of food is reduced by 50% or more, and if a rash is present, it is unlikely to be a urinary tract infection. Conclusion: The likelihood of urinary tract infection increases with men, when less than 12 months, when the amount of food is reduced by 50% or more, and decreases when there is a rash ",

            "text": "We report a case of a 9-year old girl who presented with fever, recurrent gastrointestinal disturbances, and consequent dehydration, after a visit to Pakistan 3 months previously. From her blood culture, Salmonella Enterica serovar paratyphi A was isolated, carrying the CTX-m gene and demonstrating resistance to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, pipericillin+tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and tigecyclin. This is the first case of its kind in the UK, underlining a worrying trend both toward higher proportions of enteric fever caused by S. paratyphi (an organism for which no vaccine is available), and toward increasing loss of antimicrobial effectiveness against the organism in South Asia and elsewhere. This is the first organism of its kind in the UK to be found to be resistant to all cephalosporins and narrower-spectrum beta lactamases such as amoxicillin. Further typing revealed that production of cephalosporinases by this organism contributed to this. As geographical context typically provides the predicted bacterial sensitivities, which in turn permit our empiric antibiotic treatment (while we await lab-confirmed cultures), our empiric antibiotic selection in these cases must appropriately reflect these resistance patterns. Moreover, they starkly illustrate our vital need for appropriate antibiotic stewardship now and in the future, to preserve our ability to treat the potentially-fatal condition.",

            "text": "As an additional point of interest, we have identified in this case the coexistence of entamoeba histolytica species with this S. paratyphi, which we believe may be the first such finding documented in the literature. Further study is required to elucidate their pathophysiological relationship and its effects on the clinical picture. Background: Acute tonsillitis is one of the most common medical conditions for which children and young adults seek medical advice. Despite different methods of detection, all tests are based on GAS sampling using a throat swab. However, obtaining the swab can elicit vomiting and is often accompanied by fear and apprehension in children. The aim of this study was to find a non-invasive method for the detection of GAS pharyngitis. Methods: A classic throat swab was obtained for culture, and a saliva sample was taken by voluntary spitting from 100 subjects recruited from Hadassah Medical Center and a Meuhedet Health Care Organization clinic (HMO). Real time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect GAS dnaseB specific gene in the saliva samples. Throat swabs were sent for bacterial culture. Results: 56% of the throat cultures were positive for GAS and 48% of the PCR samples were positive. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the saliva PCR method was 79% and 91% respectively; NPV and PPV were 77% and 92% respectively. When excluding patients who presented on the first day of fever, sensitivity and specificity increased to 90% and 100% respectively. No other anamnestic or clinical findings increased the yield of the test. Conclusion: Saliva-based PCR amplification of GAS DNA method is effective in detection of GAS pharyngitis. Further studies are needed to achieve detection rates to replace the traditional throat swab-based approach. Pyomyositis is a rare infection of the striated muscle. Generally results from hematogenous spread of septic emboli. It is caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus. The clinical presentation is unspecific and the diagnosis is often difficult and delayed. We present the case of a previously healthy 14 years old boy, who was admitted at Emergency Department for localized pain in the left inguinal region for 2 days. No fever, urinary complaints and no history of trauma. He presented with left lower limb flexed and pain on the left iliac fossa and anterosuperior iliac spine. X-ray and ultrasound of the pelvis did not revealed any abnormal find. Analytically he had leukocytosis, with predominance of neutrophils, C-reactive protein 79.6mg/L and sedimentation velocity of 81mm in the first hour. He performed an abomino-pelvic computed tomography scan that was normal, however, he was admitted in our hospital for surveillance. In day 1 he developed fever and inflammatory signs in the left inguinal region, therefore empirical antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous Flucloxacillin and Clindamycin. Subsequently, he performed an magnetic resonance imaging that identified multiple abscesses adjacent to the left anterior-superior iliac spine and left oblique and iliac muscles. Drainage of the abscesses was performed but no etiological agent was identified. This patient completed 14 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy and was than discharged with indication to complete five weeks of antibiotic therapy. Of the cultural exams requested the patient presented three negative blood cultures and immunological study revealed to be normal. Early diagnosis of pyomyositis is crucial and requires a high level of suspicion. In this patient it was not possible to isolate the etiologic agent probably because the abscess drainage was already performed under antibiotic therapy. Its evolution was favorable, with no associated complications and no functional limitations at the time of discharge. Background: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is an important cause of morbidity in developed countries. Indications for coprocultures are restricted and symptomatic therapy is indicated in most cases. However, the knowledge of epidemiology is fundamental in guiding therapeutic decisions. The objective of this study is to know the evolution of the local epidemiology of acute intestinal bacterial infections of children observed in a level III hospital in the last 5 years. Objective and Methods: A total of 247 positive stool samples were obtained, between 2012 to 2017. The peak of positive tests occurred during Summer, most of them in preschool age. Campylobacter spp. was the most prevalent agent (55.1%), followed by Salmonella spp. (34.8%), Yersinia (4%) and Shigella sonnei (3.6%). Faeces with blood have been detected frequently in Campylobacter spp. and the duration of diarrhea were prolonged in Salmonella spp cases. Fever were present in 69.1%. Vomits were frequent (41.1%). Bacterial co-infections were in 2% of the cases and viral ones in 12.6%, mostly due to rotavirus. References of a familiar context of AGE were present in 51%. Dehydration was the main cause of complication. Hospital admissions (39%) were superior compared with other studies, mainly due to Salmonella spp infections. Antibiotics were given in 32 cases, with resistance profile pattern similar to other national studies. Conclusion: The aetiology of AGE has been changing, depending on the country. There is a lack of studies giving us a local pattern of bacterial AGE, allowing the possibility to initiate targeted preventive measures. It is also a concern to know the principal clinical features of bacterial AGE, in order to minimize unnecessary tests or treatments, once antibiotics are still used in a high percentage of cases. ",

            "text": "Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial disease which can affect people at any age, and which is significantly underdiagnosed. Its epidemiology has recently changed with a shift in distribution from infants and young children towards older age groups. Immunity from vaccination and from illness wanes over time, leaving adolescents and adults susceptible. These are the main source of infection in infants, in whom significant complications are most common. In order to improve individual and herd immunity and thus reduce transmission of infection to young infants, an adolescent pertussis booster vaccine is recommended. This review discusses recent findings in B. pertussis epidemiology and recent advances in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention, and vaccination recommendations for the ultimate elimination of pertussis disease. Introduction: A lung abscess is an uncommon pediatric problem, characterized by a thick-walled cavity (larger than 2 centimeters) in the pulmonary parenchyma that contains purulent material resulting from a pulmonary infection. The pathogenesis of lung abscess involves an area of initial pneumonitis that leads to necrosis, cavitation and abscess formation. It is classified as primary, or secondary, based upon the existence of pre-existing conditions. The diagnosis is usually made on chest radiography, however, the use of computed tomography scan may facilitate the distinction between a lung abscess and other conditions such as necrotizing pneumonia. Clinical Case: A 2-year-old boy, previously healthy, was admitted to the pediatric department following 10 days of fever and cough despite 7 days of treatment with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Examination revealed tympanic temperature 37,4\u00b0C, oxygen saturation 96% in ambient air, auscultation with soft crackles over the right chest. Examination of other systems was normal. The peripheral blood count showed a hemoglobin of 10,1g/dL, leukocytosis of 16,000/uL with a differential neutrophil count of 73,8% and a C-reactive protein of 247mg/L. Blood cultures were negative. The chest radiograph revealed a rounded cavity involving the left hemithorax and the possibility of lung abscess was considered. The computed tomography scan described a parenchymal consolidation of the left lower lobe with necrosis and parenchyma cavity with hydro aerial level. The clinical signs resolved within 24 hours of initiation of therapy with intravenous ampicillin 400 mg/kg/day and clindamycin 30 mg/kg/day. After 2 weeks of treatment, the chest radiograph showed a marked reduction of the abscess. This treatment was continued for 3 weeks, when it was changed to oral clindamycin for an additional week. Conclusion: In conclusion, lung abscess is infrequent in infants and children. The initial choice of treatment is conservative management and the prognosis is usually very good. Introduction: Obturator internus muscle abscess is an uncommon clinical entity and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in the child who presents with a painful hip. The clinical presentation can be similar to bacterial infection of the hip joint and it generally presents as fever, hip pain with decreased range of motion, and limp. Clinical Case: We report the case of a 10-year-old boy, previously healthy, that resorted to the emergency department because of right hip pain, limp and a three-day fever. In the physical examination, there was pain over the right thigh area which aggravated with hip flexion and rotation. He played football, but there was no history of recent trauma. In the laboratorial tests performed, there was an increase of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (ESR 23 mm/h, CRP 99,5 mg/L). Blood cultures were negative. Ultrasound of the soft tissues revealed hip joint effusion. On suspicion of septic arthritis, surgical drainage of the joint was performed, and this hypothesis was not confirmed. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis revealed an abscess of the right internal obturator muscle and acetabular osteitis. The child completed 6 weeks of cefuroxime antibiotic therapy with favorable clinical and analytical evolution. Six months after discharge, the patient is asymptomatic and without changes to the objective examination. Conclusion: The diagnosis of obturator internus muscle abscess is frequently late because of its rarity and is often mistaken for septic arthritis of the hip. Small collections may not be detected on ultrasound, especially when they affect the obturator internus muscle, because of its deep location. MRI is a very sensitive examination for the diagnosis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy initiated early is critical in the resolution of this pathology. Background: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (RHS) is characterized by peripheral facial palsy, periauricular pain, vesicular eruptions of the external canal and pinna and vestibulocochlear dysfunction. RHS is rare in children but it is the second most common cause of nontraumatic facial palsy in childhood. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and treatment is a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and acyclovir. Case Report: A 13-year-old boy was admitted in the emergency room due to aggravation of right earache in the last five days, without fever. Seven days before he started treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate for right acute media otitis. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus at 10 years of age and had varicella infection at 8 years old. The physical examination revealed: right auricular edema, pain at mastoid palpation and redness of ipsilateral eardrum at otoscopy. Few hours later, he developed a vesiculobullous rash on the right ear canal and on the right half of the palate in addition to a right peripheral facial palsy (House-Brackmann scale grade II) and vestibulocochlear symptoms (hearing loss and vertigo). The complete blood count, the inflammatory markers and the computed tomography scan were normal. Pure tone audiogram confirmed a mild sensorineural hearing loss on the right side. The patient was hospitalized and started intravenous acyclovir (30mg/Kg/day), ceftriaxone (50mg/Kg/ day) and prednisolone (60mg/day) for seven days. The prednisolone dose was tapered during the following two weeks. Facial physiotherapy and eye care were also prescribed. On discharge day, the audiogram was normal. The adolescent showed a complete recovery of facial nerve function within the 20 days after discharge. Discussion: The authors want to emphasize the importance of careful examination and early initiation of therapy in suspected cases of RHS, which improves the recovery rate of the facial nerve palsy and have a positive effect on disease prognosis. Background:A suppurative infection of the mastoid air cells, complication of acute otitis media, is defined as acute mastoiditis.With the introduction of pneumoccocal vaccination, the incidence of otitis media in pediatric population has dropped and new treatment guidelines have been introduced, but it remains unclear whether this decrease has been also seen in acute mastoiditis. Objective:To compare and evaluate the demographics and clinical characteristics ofchildrenwith acute mastoiditisin pre and post pneumoccocal vaccination and \"watchful-waiting\" era. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively medical charts of childrenaged 1 month to 16 years admitted at the University Hospital Quir\u00f3n Dexeus with acute mastoiditis from January 2014 to January 2019 and compared it with a group collected and published in a period from January 1998 to January 2002. Results:A total of twenty-two cases were collected, 14 (68%) males and 8 (32%) females, with the mean age of 5.4 years and 6 (27.3%) patients younger than 2 years. We found a statistically significant decrease in the incidence, use computerized tomography as a mean on diagnosis, less use of third generation cephalosporins and faster diagnosis compared with the previous group. Conclusions:After the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination, the incidence of acute mastoiditis in our population has been reduced, but this remains to be proven in larger studies. The more prudent use of antibiotics and the vaccination will prove to be rightful pathway to further reduce this potentially harmful complication.",

            "text": "Introduction: Miliary tuberculosis is a clinical disease resulting from hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Clinical manifestations are most likely subacute or chronic and are nonspecific. Risk factors may be absent. Diagnosis is confirmed through bacteriologic identification. Case Description: A 16-year-old healthy female was admitted at our hospital with a 10-day history of daily fever, cough, night sweats and 20% estimated weight loss. Her symptoms failed to improve with previous azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate treatment. Originating from Angola, she had a household positive history for bacilliferous pulmonary tuberculosis three months before symptoms onset. On physical exam she presented tachypnea, hypoxemia and crepitations throughout both lung fields. Chest radiograph showed a bilateral reticulonodular opacification pattern; laboratory tests revealed C-reactive protein of 7.92 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35mm/sec, with normal blood cell count. HIV serology was negative. Smear and culture of sputum were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Initial treatment included supportive measures, however within 72 hours she gradually developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring management at the pediatric intensive care unit through ventilatory support and higher oxygen supply. Treatment was iniciated with piperacilin-tazobactam, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and prednisolone. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified. Piperacilin-tazobactam was stopped with a favorable evolution. Fever and hypoxemia relapsed after prednisolone withdrawal and a more prolonged course with slow tapering was needed. Mycobacterial blood cultures were negative. No extrapulmonary disease was identified. Her overall outcome was good. Conclusion: We present an immunocompetent patient with miliary tuberculosis and a severe acute presentation. Tuberculosis must be considered in any patient with epidemiologic risk. A negative sputum smear may be expected in miliary tuberculosis. Since this is a potentially lifethreatening condition, prompt diagnosis and early intervention are keys to survival. Though controversial, steroid therapy may play an important role in patients with ARDS. Background: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) can be responsible for severe and life-threatening infections, such as epiglottitis. Since the introduction of Hib conjugate vaccine, it was observed a considerable reduction in Hib invasive disease and a decrease in community nasopharyngeal carriage. Case report: A healthy and fully immunized 5-year-old girl was admitted to the pediatric emergency department with sore throat, dyspnea, and stridor. Physical examination revealed respiratory distress and diminished vesicular sounds. The general condition worsened after nebulized Lepinephrine and dexamethasone, culminating in an ill-looking appearance. Epiglottitis was suspected and intubation material was being prepared when she went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Advanced pediatric life support maneuvers were carried out for 15 minutes, which included difficult intubation and neuroprotective measures. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and connected to mechanical ventilation. Laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis 31.46x10 9 /L, neutrophilia 29 x10 9 /L, C-reactive protein 7.88mg/dL and procalcitonin 46.7ng/mL. She was medicated with cefotaxime, clindamycin, and metronidazole. Multiplex PCR detected Haemophilus influenza and microbiologic analysis confirmed Hib. She also had myoclonic movements, after cardiopulmonary arrest, and cranioencephalic CT scan together with Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) showed cerebral edema. The electroencephalogram presented status epilepticus and as so phenobarbital, propofol, levetiracetam, and 3% sodium chloride were initiated. The patient was referred to a pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary hospital. She was evaluated by pediatric neurology and MRI exam revealed severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The neurologic exam showed a progressive deterioration, reporting an irreversible loss of brain function, including the brain stem. Electroencephalogram showed isoelectric trace and TCD demonstrated cerebral circulatory arrest, having been decided to withdraw life support. Conclusion: Despite the high efficacy of Hib vaccine, invasive Hib disease can occur and be fatal in an apparently immunocompetent and immunized child. Epiglottitis should continue to be considered in patients with dyspnea and stridor. Background: Influenza is a vaccine-preventable respiratory infection that results in substantial morbidity and mortality each year. Although infants below 6 months of age have the highest hospitalization rates for their increased risk of developing severe influenza, the existing influenza vaccines are not licensed for this group of age. Objectives: To analyze hospitalization episodes with an ICD-9 diagnosis code of influenza (codes 487 and 488) in any diagnostic position in infants up to 6 months of age from 2009 to 2015 in the Spanish hospital surveillance system. Methods: Retrospective survey by reviewing data of the National Surveillance System for Hospital Data including more than 98% of Spanish hospitals and 99.5% of the population in Spain. It contains data Actinomyces spp. are commensal gram-positive, non-sporulating, anaerobic bacteria which may cause infections in both immunocompetent patients and in patients with impaired host defenses. Actinomycosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rare manifestation affecting between 1-15% of cases with actinomycotic infection. We present a child with multiple brain abscess due to A. odontolyticus. Case: A 2 6/12 years-old male patient with neither previous history of hospitalization or trauma nor family history of early death or serious illness (except prematurity-32 gestation week and twin) was admitted (five and one day ago before admission to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)) with complaints of fatigue, vomiting and nasal discharge (no fever). At secondary admission, brain CT and MRI scan were performed because of weakness of the extremities on the left side revealing three brain abscesses in the right hemisphere and a shift to the left hemisphere. He was transferred to our PICU for further treatment. In addition to neurosurgical drainage of the abscess, vancomycin plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole intravenously were initiated. Also decompressive craniectomy was performed. Actinomyces odontolyticus was isolated from the pus obtained during surgery. Since he had lymphopenia (1300/mm 3 ) primary and secondary immunodeficiencies were searched. HIV serology was negative. Serum immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subset analysis, and dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test results were normal. The blood specimen for CH50 was sent, all exons analyzes were performed in terms of genetic defects. Conclusion: Antimicrobial treatment following neurosurgical evaluation of the CNS abscess resulted in complete neurofunctional recovery. The clinicians should keep in mind that A. odontolyticus may be a causal agent in brain abscesses even in healthy children. Background: In recent years there has been an increasing in number of tropical stays in children. They are related to tourism, migration and international adoption. Malaria in one of the main diseases that should be ruled out in this kind of patients. Children under 5 years old have an increased risk of severe illness. In fact, malaria is the fourth cause of children mortality worldwide. Therefore, we should study malaria and its treatment, specially its features in children and its severe form. Objective: The aim of the present study was to describe epidemiological, clinical, analytical, microbiological, radiological and treatment characteristics of patients with severe malaria in a tertiary Spanish hospital. Methods: We performed a case series study. It included 12 patients who suffered from severe malaria and were admitted from 2004 to 2018. Results: The average age of patients was 4 years old. Eight patients were female. Four patients were transferred from other hospitals and two by the airport sanitary services. All severe cases were caused by Plasmodium falciparum. All patients contracted the disease in west Africa. Seven of the them lived there and travelled to Spain. The other five patients travelled from Spain to visit relatives. Eight patients (75%) got malaria in Equatorial Guinea. Just one received prophylaxis with mefloquine. Fever and digestive symptoms were the most frequent. One patient, treated with intravenous quinine, suffered black water fever. Table shows main features. Five patients showed a parasitaemia equal or higher than 5%. The highest parasitaemia detected was 12%. Intravenous quinine plus clindamycin and intravenous artesunate were the most frequently used initial treatments. None of the patients presented sequelae related to malaria or died. Conclusion: Malaria should be suspected in every patient with fever traveling from endemic countries. Most children with severe malaria had parasitaemia under 10%. These patients present severe complications and must be initially treated in critical care settings. Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an invasive bacillus and a trigger of upper and lower respiratory infections. The invasive strain and the child's immune response are the focal factors to whether it will spread to a disease or will remain within the frame of a carriage status.",

            "text": "Aim: With the introduction of a vaccine that is not on a regular vaccine calendar, the number of children infected with rhinosinusitis, otitis and pneumonia, has dropped significantly. Methods and Investigations: A study of 325 children has been conducted in the period of 2015-2018, out of which, 191 males and 134 females, carriers of pneumococci in nasopharynx. 242 children attend kindergarten and 83 are taken care of at home. Depending on the clinical presentation, a symptomatic and antibiotic treatment has been provided. After receiving 1 to 2 doses of the vaccine, the number of paediatrician visits decreased dramatically. Also, outstanding effect has been detected to the sample who received 2 doses. Conclusion: Although the pneumococcal vaccine is not mandatory in the vaccine calendar, it delivers great benefits including reduced usage of antibiotics. It is my personal regret that it's not available yet in my country and the children remain unprotected, therefore, I appeal for its procurement since it's vital for the health of children between the age of 9 months and 3 years. Infections of the urinary tract are the second frequent among all bacterial infections in the pediatric population. Recurrent infections lead to chronic inflammatory changes. If the symptoms of cystitis last for more than 2-3 weeks or recurrences appear after a short period of remission, chronic cystitis may be assumed. The most common form of chronic inflammation in children is cystitis cystica, diagnosed in approximately 10% of patients with urinary tract infections, with a definite female predominance (80%). Macroscopically, in the endoscopic examination small cysts of pearl, pink, brown or yellow color are found. The lesions are usually located in the area of the bladder triangle, neck and around the ureteral mouth, but they can occupy the entire surface of the bladder, and are rarely described in the ureter and pelvis. The bladder wall trabeculation, swelling and congestion of the mucous membrane, incorrect location and widening of the the ureters orifices are often found. The pathogenesis of the disease is unclear. The most frequently isolated inflammatory agent is E.coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria: Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and others. According to some authors, cystitis cystica is considered a precancerous condition. Clinically, the inflammation may be asymptomatic or proceed in the form of active infection. Chronic inflammation can lead to urinary incontinence, urgency, pollakiuria, dysuria and even urinary retention. In urodynamic studies, a decrease in the volume of urine given per portion in relation to the expected values, irregular curves of tubular flows, their flatness, residual urine after micturition, are observed, which is the cause of subsequent infections. Treatment of cystitis cystitis is difficult and long-lasting. A multi-month alternation treatment with furazidine and trimethoprim with sulphamethoxazole administered orally and intravesical instillations of antibiotics (gentamicin) and corticosteroids (prednisone) are applied. The results of treatment depend on the severity of changes in the bladder, and full recovery is obtained only in the case of lesions of low and medium intensity. The authors present their own experience regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cystitis cystica.",

The worldwide resurgence of measles infection in recent years and its impact on the paediatric population of a small cosmopolitan city-state, with high volume of migrational traffic like Singapore is unknown. Our study aims to describe epidemiological trends of proven measles infection cases that presented to our emergency department and identify risk factors that can influence our emergency department isolation policies. Methods: This study is a retrospective observational cohort study, looking at laboratory-confirmed measles infection in patients. Patients admitted through our paediatric emergency department from January 2010 to December 2016 were included. Data was collected on demographics, clinical features at presentation, isolation precautions implementation, admission duration, and vaccination records. Results: A total of 277 patients were hospitalised for measles infection. Of these, 90 (32%) patients were isolated at triage at initial presentation. Eighty-one (29%) patients attended the emergency department more than once, prior to admission. Patients presented to the emergency department at an average of 4.3 day of illness at presentation. At initial presentation, 75 (27%) patients did not have rash. Out of all the admitted patients with measles, only 1 patient had completed 2-dose measles vaccination. Conclusions: Our study found that it is difficult to adequately identify and isolate all patients with measles infection, even with strict isolation strategies. As such, there is an urgent need for global healthcare systems to promote vaccination uptake to increase herd immunity and curb the spread of infection, especially to at-risk population groups. LGG have a moderate level of evidence and strong recommendation, Lactobacillus reuteri DSM-17938(L.reuteri) has a low level of evidence and weak recommendation. Objective: Compare the effectiveness of probiotics with a strong recommendation and moderate level of evidence (L.rhamnosus GG and S.boulardii) and probiotics with a low recommendation and low level of evidence (L reuteriDSM-17938) as adjuvant therapy for AGE caused by rotavirus in children under 5. Methods: 122 children under 5 with symptoms of AGE were examined. Determination of the antigen of the rotavirus was performed by ELISA. The children were divided into groups depending on which probiotic were used. The first group received a LGG or S.boulardii. The second group was treated with L. reuteri. The number of episodes of stools/day, the length of stay in a hospital and the total duration of diarrhea syndrome were estimated. Results: The first group was 59 children, in the second group-63 children. LGG and S.bullardi has better affect the reduction of stool frequency then L.reuteri, and thus ease the symptoms of the disease. 2. LGG,S.bullardi and L.reuteri have the same effect on the duration of the disease and hospitalization. Greek nationality had 17/23 (73.91 %). No siblings at home reported in 13.05% (3/23), two and three in 43.47% (10/23) and in 30.43% (7/23) respectively and four in 13.05% (3/23). Type A influenza virus identified in 21/23 (91%) and type B in 2/23 (9%). Fever 39.5 o C had 17/23 children (73.91%) and 39.5 o 6/23 (26.08%). Rhinitis with couphing had 86.95% (20/23) cases, vomiting 13.04% (3/23), diarhoea 8.69% (2/23) and limp walking 4.34% (1/23). Main complications were pneumonia (4/23, 17.39%), the remaining being myositis, dehydration, neutropenia in one case respectively. Conclusions: One out of three children hospitalized with febrile RTI during influenza period were identified as influenza illness. Main virus type was A. Having none or two many siblings seemed to be a favorable protective factor. Background: The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in Lithuania is one of the highest in the European Union. According national legislation the BCG vaccine is given obligatory during first 3 days after the birth and tuberculin skin test (TST) carried out for all children of 7-years-old and higher TB risk children at different age (not vaccinated children, TB contacts, children from social risk families including migrants, etc.). Objective: The aim of the research was the assessment of the effectiveness of TST screening program of 7-year-old children and children of higher TB risk groups in Lithuania. Material and Methods: The retrospective descriptive analysis of the use of TST in Lithuania between 2013 and 2018 was conducted. The data are processed by SPSS 22.0 program, the difference between the compared groups is considered significant when p\u22640.05. Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disease under 6 years old is an indicator of recent transmission. Strategies to control TB are influenced by its incidence. Portugal became a low incidence country in 2014. In 2016, BCG vaccination switched from universal immunization to risk groups recommendation. Objectives: Characterization of TB cases in children under six years old in a Pediatric Department of a level II hospital in Lisbon metropolitan area, which serves a high percentage of immigrants from Portuguesespeaking African countries. Methods: Retrospective and descriptive study of TB disease in patients under six years old treated in our Department between January 2004 and December 2018 (15 years). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imagiologic and therapeutic data were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics 25. Results: 19 patients were included, nine (47%) were diagnosed between 2016 and 2018. Median age of 22 months (min: 0.3, max: 70), 57.9% female. 12 patients had immigrant families from countries with high TB incidence and another three were born in those countries. Seven out of nine patients not immunized with BCG had recommendation to do so. Although a close contact with TB was known in 12 patients at the time of referral to our center, three of those didn't start on chemoprophylaxis and two were not screened. At diagnosis: four patients had disseminated TB (three miliary TB and one congenital TB), 10 cases had microbiological confirmation by PCR or culture and one case had multirresistant TB. None had HIV infection. Four patients had sequelae (bronchiectasis in one, atelectasis in two, scoliosis in one).",

            "text": "The increase in TB cases under six years old in the last three years points to some pitfalls in TB surveillance and transmission prevention. Although living in a low incidence country, the migration flux must be taken into consideration regarding the prevention of TB. Acute mastoiditis (AM) is a suppurative infection of the mastoid air cells with symptoms of less than one month`s duration. The clinical spectrum of mastoiditis ranges from a lack of symptoms with spontaneous resolution to progressive disease with life-threatening complications. A 28-month-old girl, with updated immunization schedule and history of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), was evaluated in day (D1) of fever, rhinorrhea and frontal headache and treated symptomatically for upper airway infection. In D4, for persistence of fever, was re-evaluated and diagnosed with bilateral AOM. Started treatment with oral cefuroxime and betamethasone, with apyrexia since D6. In D7 noticed left retro-auricular inflammatory signs and poor feeding. She was admitted with the diagnosis of left AM and started intravenous ceftriaxone, nasal and topical corticosteroids. In D9 restarted fever and in D11 worsened left retro-auricular inflammatory signs with significant swelling and fluctuation. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial computed tomography with intravenous contrast revealed bilateral mastoiditis, left subperiosteal abscess, left temporal extra-axial empyema and suspicion of ipsilateral partial thrombosis, all findings confirmed by cranial magnetic resonance. She was submitted to left mastoidectomy and myringotomy, without isolation of agent in the exudate. Ceftriaxone dose was increased to meningeal doses and started on intravenous metronidazole and dexamethasone and subcutaneous enoxaparin. She had progressive clinical, analytical and imaging improvement. Completed 4 weeks of antibiotic and enoxaparin treatment and 10 days of dexamethasone and was discharged with oral hypocoagulation. Currently, after four months of multidisciplinary follow-up, she had no complications or sequels and keeps a normal psychomotor development. Complications of mastoiditis, although rare, may be serious with significant morbidity and mortality. An unfavorable clinical course of AM should raise the suspicion of complications and the need of imaging evaluation. Introduction: Antifungal Lock Therapy (AfLT) in patients with fungemia and valuable long-term CVCs is an acceptable treatment with catheter salvage about 75%. The common approach locks the catheter with an antifungal agent of a proper solution, at least for 12h/24h, in conjunction with systemic antifungal therapy. Ethanol 70% lock is an alternative approach which could augment the success rate. The aim of the current case report is to present the successful eradication of Candida parapsilosis fungemia and Hickman catheter salvage with Dual AfLT in a pediatric PICU patient. Patient presentation: A 7mo, 8kg infant (F) was admitted in PICU with severe bronchiolitis. Due to prolonged PICU stay and mechanical complications of prior CVCs (DVT on both femoral veins), a two lumen, 7F, Hickman catheter was inserted on 40 th day. On the 50 th day a Candida parapsilosis fungemia was developed in a screening blood culture (BC) followed by 3 more positive BC till the 54 th day. Peripheral veins were inserted and systemic Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) therapy was started in parallel with AfLT (2mg/ml, 4 ml/each lumen, changed/12h). One day later, to enhance results, ethatol 70% was added (2 ml/each lumen) interchangeably (12h L-AMB/12h ethanol), plus systemic voriconazole. Results: BC became negative on 2 th treatment day and therapy was continued for additional 14 days. No serious adverse effect was recorded. The patient was discharged with a tracheostomy, spontaneously breathing on 98 th day and remains infection free. Conclusions: Given the integral role of long-term CVC and the limited venous access in PICU pts, dual AfLT appears to be a promising strategy as an adjunctive therapy for fungemia treatment and catheter salvage. Background: In 2017 in the UK, there were 2,206 asylum applications from unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC). Our local population had the third highest numbers of asylum seekers in the region. They are at an increased risk of health complications including blood borne viruses and tuberculosis. Objective: The aim of this audit was to compare the current practice of infection screening of UASC in our department with the screening advice set out in the migrant health guide by Public Health England. Methods: The 'looked after children assessment' reports of all UASC in 2018 were retrospectively analysed. The recommendations regarding screening for blood borne viruses and TB were noted. A search was conducted on the trust's pathology system to confirm what testing the patient had received and what the results were. The patient's country of origin was then referenced with the recommended screening set out by Public Health England. Results: Out of 23 children, more than half had screening recommendations that were incorrect. This included both under and over-testing. Most frequently, testing was requested when it not necessary. Infrequently it was not requested when it was required. 7 of the 23 patients who were recommended to have screening for blood borne viruses did not have the necessary tests. 16 of the 23 patients did not have TB screening despite it being recommended. Conclusion: The infection risk for asylum seeking children varies greatly by country and so the screening advice needs to reflect this. Over testing can have negative impacts to a child by subjecting them to unnecessary blood tests, and has cost implications. It is equally important that patients at a higher risk are screened appropriately. Improvement interventions have included follow up letters for missed tests and addressing the referral process for TB screening. Background: In the Philippines, approximately 14 per 100,000 become affected with leptospirosis. A spike of 60% in leptospirosis case in the National Capital Region during January 2018 to July 2018 alone. Worldwide, it was estimated that 500,000 severe cases of Leptospirosis occur yearly. Health prevention is an inexpensive way to prevent diseases, and in such, the health sectors tapped the community workers in aiding in information dissemination. There have been many health workers and even including the young population worldwide. In the Philippines, the term \"Bulilit\" means child, hence the name Bulilit health workers . Most studies done on evaluation of health education in prevention of diseases focused on other diseases. Data with the use of KAP tool in Leptospirosis and more so on younger population are scarce, hence this study. Objective: To assess health education as a tool in improving the knowledge, attitude and practices among bulilit health workers on leptospirosis. Design: A prospective cross-sectional analytical study was used. Settings: The study was done in a public grade school in Manila Participants: Bulilit Health Workers of a public school in Manila were the participants of the study Interventions: A PowerPoint lecture regarding leptospirosis was given. Main Outcome Measures: Pretest questionnaire was given followed by the lecture, after which, a post-test questionnaire was done. Statistical method used was paired t-test. Results: Participants were ages 7-11 years, with almost equal distribution between male and female. Majority go to school by riding a vehicle. The television is the most common source of information. There was an increase in the mean scores comparing the baseline to the post test scores (p=0.0001). The total mean score for knowledge regarding leptospirosis is 86.36% for the pretest and 95.45% to post-test; for attitude 71.33% and 78.67%; and 82.9% and 88.33% for practices. Conclusions: There is a significant improvement in knowledge, attitude and practices for leptospirosis after an informative lecture among the Bulilit Health Workers. Therefore, health education even on younger subjects can improve knowledge, attitude and practices towards Leptospirosis. Aim: Acute bacterial gastroenteritis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the developing countries. We examined the incidence, clinical features and outcomes in the first week of life. Methods: This was a retrospective study of culture-proven bacterial gastroenteritis in newborn infants that were diagnosed between January 2011 and September 2018 in a tertiary centre in Israel. Results: There were 10 cases of culture-proven bacterial gastroenteritis, detected out of 91 stool cultures. All infants were born vaginally and nine were full-term infants. The annual incidence was 0.096 per 1000 live births. The responsible pathogen was Campylobacter in six patients, Salmonella in two and Shigella sonnei in two. The mean age of disease onset was two days of life. Antibiotics were given to five patients, but were inappropriate in two cases. Only one patient with the Shigella sonnei infection required respiratory support. All patients fully recovered. Conclusion: One in ten newborn infants with bloody stools had bacterial gastroenteritis, contradicting the low rates found in other studies and indicating the importance of considering this diagnosis. Antimicrobials active against Salmonella or Shigella should be given to newborn infants who have bloody stools and look ill. Introduction: Tongue-tie (TT), also known as ankyloglossia, is diagnosed when the lingual frenum is short and restricts the mobility of the tongue and can be an isolated finding in upto 5% of infants. It can have an adverse effect on oromuscular function, breast feeding (BF) and speech later on. While the existence of tongue-tie has never been doubted, there have been sporadic reports of familial TT that are non syndromic. Methods: We performed a retrospective analyses of infants treated or followed for TT at a large pediatric private practice in Phoenix and its suburbs in AZ to look for patterns of inheritance of this condition. Results: We followed 6982 patients with TT over a 13 year period from 2006 to 2019. An analyses of the patients attending the clinic over 1 year period (2018-19) was done. We identified multiple families with several members affected by TT. The patterns of inheritance included Autosomal Dominant (n=5), Autosomal Recessive (n=23) and X linked (n=1). Both males and females were equally affected. A significant number of patients had symptoms of dysfunctional BF, diastema or speech problems (in older children / adults). Conclusion: TT can be a very common and often underdiagnosed problem in infants. Untreated TT can cause significant problems in post natal period that can lead to failure of BF. A family history should be taken to assess and identify additional family members with TT Background: There are numerous advantages of breastfeeding (BF) for both the mother and the newborn and every effort should be made to prevent its failure. Nipple trauma and latching problems, often seen in infants with tongue tie (TT) can contribute to development of poor intraoral vacuum pressure and lead to BF failure. This dysfunctional BF could be to quantitatively assessed by measuring the inter-oral cavity vacuum pressure. Methods: We developed a simple and portable oral manometer for measuring intra-oral vacuum pressures using off the shelf components and without the need for a complex setup or operator skills. Results: The working manometer prototype has 3 main components: 1) pressure transducer, 2) tubing assembly, 3) a laptop computer.Further details are as follows: The pressure transducer: This is the main component and uses an absolute pressure transducer with DAQ system (National Instruments) and is connected to the tubing assembly on one end and a computer on the other. Tubing assembly: It consists of disposable Silicone Rubber Tubing (5F); Blunt Tip Dispensing Needle with Luer Lock and has an in line hydrophobic Filter (PTFE 13mm)that acts as barrier to fluids's entry into the transducer assembly. Computer: A laptop with a dedicated software developed utilizing NI LabVIEW for data acquisition Preliminary testing: It was performed on a full-term healthy infant and a adult volunteer. In infant the sucking process was characterized by a burst-pause sucking pattern where a bursts occurring at a typical frequency of~1 Hz, separated by pauses of~2 s. This pattern manifested in three stages: continuous, intermittent and paused. Conclusion: We report the development of oral manometer for quatitative assessment of BF. It needs futher studies and validation and can be potentially used for assessement of BF in infants with and with out TT and other cranio-facial malformations.",

            "text": "We found heart murmur in 52 babies over a period of 12 months (2017-2018) during routine baby check at postnatal ward at University Hospital Lewisham. Following thorough physical examination of all babies with neonatal heart murmur, we checked femoral pulses, pre and post ductal oxygen saturations and 4 limbs blood pressure as part of their assessment for heart murmur. All babies with normal saturation and femoral pulses were assessed again at neonatal follow up clinic after 4 weeks. Babies who had still heart murmur were referred to paediatric cardiology clinic for further assessment including echocardiography. Results: The incidence of heart murmur in babies was 1.3%. All babies had normal pre and postductal saturation and femoral pulses. Almost in 50% of babies' upper limb mean blood pressure (MBP) was higher than lower limb MBP. Almost all babies with heart murmur had a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Only 1 patient had aortic regurgitation on echocardiography. Conclusion: Measuring 4 limb blood pressure in babies with heart murmur who have normal oxygen saturation and normal femoral pulses does not add any additive value in assessment of babies with heart murmur. Background: Inherited ichthyoses are a group of genetic disorders characterized by generalized dry skin, scaling and hyperkeratosis, and often associated with erythroderma. These manifestations are due to mutations in genes mostly involved in skin barrier formation, particularly in keratinization. Multiple causes have been associated with ichthyosis that may or may not be related to genetic syndromes. Case Report: A newborn female of inbreeding Roma parents was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit due to prematurity (33w+6d) and low birth weight (895g). Intrauterine growth restriction was detected at 21 th weeks of gestation and an emergent caesarean section was performed at 33 weeks as fetal bradycardia was seen in continuos cardiotocography. At birth, she presented with dysmorphic facial features, general dermatosis and global alopecia with cutaneous fragility and erythema spots. Humeral fracture was diagnosed immediately after delivery. Since the first 24 hours of life she suffered from hydroelectrolyte imbalances with hypernatremic dehydration (maximum 167mmol/L) and hypokalemia (minimum 2.2mmol/L) associated with polyuria and later, hypomagnesemia (minimum 1.06mmol/L), hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Simultaneously there was weight loss (23.5% of birth weight). Due to the long-lasting polyuria together with the electrolyte changes she needed high fluid intakes and ion supplemented. She also had recurrent Staphylococcus aureus sepsis with multiple prolonged antibiotic courses. It was requested Dermatology, Primary Immunodeficiency and Genetics collaboration and the genetic tests are still in course. We compared this case to a previous similar case back in 2017 presented with ichthyosis and severe hydroelectrolyte imbalances (including hypomagnesemia) born to consanguineous Roma parents, which is associated to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) homozygous pathogenic mutation. Background: Unexpected term admission, a proxy indicator of harm occurring along the maternity-neonatal pathway form the largest proportion of admissions to neonatal units. On our unit, they account for just under 50% of admissions, leading indications being respiratory conditions and hypothermia. Skin to skin (STS) immediately after birth is known to enhance the natural bonding process and facilitate smooth postnatal adaptation. We describe our experience of reducing term admissions from respiratory condition (TARC) through implementation of in-theatre skin to skin (ITSTS) and NEWTT escalation pathway bundle. Methods: Primary target was mothers presenting for elective Caesarean Sections (EL-CS) at term. Change process involved using Improvement methodology including process maps and cause and effect diagrams. Review of background term admission data (Badger-Net database) detailing leading admission indications, CS type, admission duration, type/length of respiratory support and whether ITSTS was offered and received was undertaken. Parental education on benefits of STS, staff training on providing ITSTS and offering ITSTS to mothers presenting for EL-CS. In theatre, monitoring leads were placed on mother's back, blood pressure cuff on non-dominant arm and operating table placed at a slight head-up tilt to increase comfort. Once cord was cut, baby was dried, immediately placed in direct contact with mother's chest and covered with pre-warmed blankets. STS continued for at least an hour. A NEWTT escalation pathway codesigned with staff was introduced to guide management of term babies with respiratory conditions following CS. Results: 48% reduction in TARC following EL-CS 77% of babies who would otherwise have been separated remained with their mothers. 19% reduction in total term admission/1000 deliveries. 85% of EL-CS mums offered ITSTS and 85 % achieved it. Conclusion: ITSTS and NEWTT escalation pathway has significantly decreased TARC, decreased separation of mothers and babies, increased parent satisfaction and fostered collaborative working. Requires ongoing QI work to sustain and spread. Results: 38 (0.3% of live births) were identified as HIE: grade 1-34%; grade 2 -37%; grade 3 -29%. 53% were cooled. 47% had seizures. 3 infants with grade 3 died. For grade 2 babies, 90% of the 10 cases where babies were cooled had normal MRI's. 50% of the 4 babies not cooled had MRI changes and developmental delay. The most common developmental concern in Grade 2 HIE was speech delay (15%). 1 patient with grade 2 had poor cord gases, but AGPARS 7 5, 9 10 and was initially neurologically intact so was not cooled, but developed seizures at 8 hours. MRI changes and mild developmental delay was observed at 2 years. 26% of HIE patients followed, including 1 with grade 1 HIE, had developmental delay. 18% of all grade 3 babies had profound delay, but 36% had a normal Baileys assessment at 2 years following cooling. Conclusion: Developmental follow up is very important in HIE, particularly grades 2 and 3. Grades 1 and 2 have good outcomes for survival and neurodevelopment. Cooling should be carefully considered in grade 2 babies. Neurology should be observed closely in patients with poor gases, ensuring the window of opportunity is not missed. Objective: To assess the intra-and inter-observer variability in PDA internal diameter measured on TTE on the same examination in babies born at \u226430 weeks' gestation. Methods: We included 56 babies born \u226430 weeks gestation that had clinically indicated TTEs. TTEs were performed by a neonatologist (AK) certified in echocardiography. PDAs were visualised on high parasternal views, and cineloops were stored without measurement annotations. PDAs were measured at the narrowest diameter on 2-Dimensional (2D) and Colour Doppler echocardiography. A second certified neonatologist (DD) measured the internal diameter of PDA on the same cineloops. They were blinded to each other's measurements. AK repeated measurements at a later date, blinded to his original measurements. Results: Table 1 shows results for inter-observer comparisons. Fig  1 and 2 show intra-observer measurement comparisons. Comparison of all measurements showed colour measurements a mean of 0.29 mm higher than 2D. Table 1 . Bland-Altman Analysis of inter-observer measurement comparisons. Conclusion: The poor repeatability coefficients and repeatability indices lead us to conclude that there is significant inter-and intra-observer variability in 2D and Colour echocardiography measurements of PDA diameter, even on the same cineloops.Thresholds and timing of treatment for PDA remain controversial. We advise caution when using diameter as a surrogate marker for degree of shunting. Preterm neonates represent a vulnerable population with a high sensitivity to their environment. While hospitalized in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), they can possibly be exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) due to the increased number of devices using wireless communications (mobile phones, DECT, WIFI). Strikingly, data on RF-EMF levels in NICU are currently not available in the literature. The aim of the present study was to quantify the RF-EMF levels in a NICU by performing a mapping of environmental RF-EMF levels and by measuring spot emissions from medical devices. Measurements of RF-EMF levels were performed in a tertiary NICU including 34 beds using three-axis dosimeters. A first set of 24h measurements aimed at evaluating the RF-EMF levels in the general environment and in children's rooms. A second set of measurements, in faradised chamber, assessed RF-EMF emitted by medical devices commonly used in the NICU and identified as potential sources of exposure. For a total of 102 measurement points were analysed. Mean RF-EMF levels were significantly higher in the staff environment than in children's rooms (p0.0011), and were also significantly higher during the day than during the night (p0.001). The highest RF-EMF levels (above the mean value \u00b1 2SD) represented 3.5% of the measurement duration. Very high peak values above 6 V/m were also detected. The measurements with isolated NICU medical devices showed that they do not emit RF fields. Globally, mean RF-EMF levels in the NICU were low. The detection of RF-EMF levels was more probably related to the parents and staff activities rather than to medical devices. A chronic exposure combined with high peak values in this specifically vulnerable population should require particular attention. Decreasing the preterm neonates' exposure to RF-EMF would include parental and staff intervention to reduce the wireless communication and others devices in the NICU. Introduction: Adaptive physiological changes during pregnancy lead to an increase of pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress that occurs when antioxidant mechanisms are overcome and exerts a negative effect on fetal growth and development. Seleno-compounds such as glutathione-peroxidase and thioredoxin-reductase, are endogenous antioxidants that play a key role in defence against oxidative stress. Aim of the Study: The aim of the study was to identify a correlation between the serum and urinary selenium levels and the neonatal mechanisms of response to intrauterine hypoxia and subsequent oxidative stress. Materials and Methods: A prospective case-control study was conducted over a 3 month period (1 st of January -31 st of March 2017 ), at the Clinic of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Neonatology of the Emergency County Hospital Timisoara. The study group consisting of 32 SGA neonates was matched 1:1 for gestational age with AGA newborns, representing the control group. After obtaining the written consent from the caregivers, venous blood samples of 2 mL were collected at birth from the umbilical cord and 5 mL of urine were collected using sterile urine collecting bags in all neonates included in the study. The selenium concentration was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results and Discussions: Mean serum selenium concentrations were lower in SGA neonates compared to the control group ( 29.44 \u03bcg/L versus 43.26 \u03bcg/L). Neonates from the study group also had significantly lower levels of urinary selenium compared to controls ( 18.88 \u03bcg/L and 29.15 \u03bcg/L respectively).",

Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). HRV constitutes a relevant noninvasive tool to assess the autonomic nervous system (ANS) function especially in preterm infants nearby their term corrected age. HRV would be a rational way to assess cardiovascular system maturation in this population. A stable and mature cardiovascular condition is essential before discharge of preterm infants.

The complex form of gastroschisis (involvement of other intestinal annomalies, ischemia, and perforations) was associated with a longer hospital lenght of stay and septicaemia was the commonest cause of death but the outcome of our patients had an obvious improvement during the studied period. As the result, the care of these patients must involve specific antenatal ultrasound exams, an efficient multidisciplinary team and suitable surgical and nutritional protocols in order to improve neonatal survival. The incidence of jaundice is about 80% in preterm newborns, and Phototherapy (PT) is considered the first-line treatment. The efficacy of PT depends not only on the device characteristics but also on the modalities of use such as the distance between the infant and the device, the light source, the body surface area exposed, and the duration of exposure. However, risks such as hyperthermia also exist during PT, and the evaluation of the parameters that influence PT efficiency and the overheating risk is not easy in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of overheating during PT. A thermal mannequin representing a preterm newborn was used to simulate heat exchange and to propose a new optimal air temperature setpoint during PT in various clinical situations. We evaluated the impact of 3 different incubator models, the distance between the PT device and the preterm newborn(incubator roof or 5cm above), and the time required to reach thermal equilibrium during PT. Preliminary data point out that there is a risk of hyperthermia related to decreased heat loss in the premature newborn during PT. Introduction: Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to preterm infants and are known to disrupt microbial balance. Our objective was to determine the impact of different empiric antibiotics use in the first week of life on microbial colonization and diversity in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. Methods: Breast fed VLBW infants were divided into two groups, including those who received 3 d of combination treatment of ampicillin and gentamicin (AG group), and those received 7 d of ampicillin and cefotaxime (AC group). Infants with any antibiotics use after age of 7d and infants on exclusive formula feeding were excluded. Stool samples were collected at age of 7d, 14d, and 30d. The 16s ribosomal DNA community profiling was used to compare the microbiota between two groups. Results: Twenty-four infants were enrolled in our study (AG group =10, AC group =14 Background: Endotracheal intubation remains a complex procedure in neonatal care as a malposition may lead to pulmonary complications. To confirm correct endotracheal tube (ETT) position, chest X-Ray (CX) is the reference investigation. However it is often delayed and exposes to ionizing radiations. Bedside ultrasonography (US) is a faster non-invasive technique which might supply CX. Objective: To compare US and CX in order to confirm an endotracheal intubation and evaluate the appropriate ETT position. Methods: All neonates admitted in our level III neonatal ward and intubated were included. Immediately after intubation, the radiology unit was called for a CX as well as the neonatologist to perform a bedside tracheal US which consisted in two views: -a coronal view with direct visualization of the trachea to confirm the tracheal intubation -a parasternal view to determine the distance between the tip of the tube and the aortic arch. A distance between 0.5 and 1 centimeter was considered as optimal. On X-ray, ETT was in good position if visualized in relation to the body of the first thoracic vertebra. Number of bradycardia and desaturations were recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of US to determine the same position of ETT as CX were calculated. Results: Twenty five infants were included with a mean corrected gestational age of 32.3 weeks +/-6.2 and mean birth weight of 1796g +/-676. Endotracheal intubation was confirmed for all the patients by CX and US. The positive predictive value to confirm the intratracheal position of the tube was 100%. Sensitivity of US to detect the same ETT position as CX was 77%, specificity 29%. No adverse effects were recorded during the US. Conclusion: Tracheal US, performed by neonatologists, is a fast investigation to confirm the tracheal intubation and appears feasible to evaluate ETT position. Results: There were a total of 1346 births, 4,9% (n=66) of them corresponding to macrosomic newborns, with male predominance (74%). Regarding maternal factors: maternal mean age was 30,2 \u00b1 6,2 years; 1,6% presented pre-eclampsia; 10,9% had diabetes (1/7 pre-gestational and 6/7 gestational diabetes); 9,4% were obese; 4,7% smokers and 31,3% had a previous macrosomic newborn. In relation to newborn factors: 15,6% had a prenatal diagnosis of macrosomia; the mean gestational age was 39,9 \u00b1 1 weeks; mean birth weight of 4356,7 \u00b1 304,4 grams with 41% large for gestational age (P90). At least one complication was present in 81% of the newborns (hyperbilirubinemia in 28,1%, neonatal hypoglycemia in 23,4%, shoulder dystocia in 10,9%, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in 10,9%, brachial plexus palsy in 4,7%, clavicle fracture in 3,1%, weight loss greater than 10% in 3,1%,) and 6% needed hospitalization in a neonatal care unit. Maternal postpartum hemorrhage occurred in 1,6% and 56,3% (n=48) had perineal laceration.",

Objective: To examine the risk factors for late-onset sepsis (LOS) and the outcomes in extremely preterm neonates. Also, to evaluate any association between LOS and the brain MRI findings at term equivalent age. Background: Congenital knee dislocation (CKD) is a rare anomaly, with an incidence of about 1%, that mostly affects female sex (ratio 10:3). In CKD there is a variable anterior displacement of the tibia under the femur, frequently associated with other musculoskeletal abnormalities (hip developmental dysplasia, equine varus foot) or syndromes (Larsen syndrome). Fibrosis and shortening of the quadriceps muscle with supra-patellar hypoplasia is a pathognomonic characteristic of CKD.

Maternal serologies were negative and prenatal ultrasound scans did not detect any anomalies. Eutocic delivery, anthropometry was appropriate to gestational age, with Apgar Index 9/10. Physical examination at birth detected an abnormal position of the knees and legs, with no other associated anomalies. Those findings were interpreted as a congenital knee dislocation and the newborn was evaluated by orthopedics, confirming the diagnosis. The treatment of choice was conservative and, therefore, a plaster cast was applied. Control radiography was performed and the patient was discharged, with neonatal and orthopedic referral in order to guarantee an adequate follow-up. Conclusion: The conservative approach, with immediate reduction of the dislocation within the first hours of life, is in agreement with most of the literature. The detection of other associated orthopedic anomalies on physical examination is still of primary importance. This case highlights the role of the pediatrician in the identification, diagnosis and early intervention of these situations. Background: Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) occurs when the mother forms antiplatelet antibodies against fetal platelets. Clinical findings depend on the severity of thrombocytopenia, including petechiae, bruising and bleeding, in mostly otherwise well-appearing newborns. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of maternal antihuman platelet antibody. Case Report: Full-term newborn routinely examined on the first day of life. First pregnancy, without complications. Routine serologic testing and prenatal ultrasounds without alterations. Vacuum-assisted delivery, Apgar score of 9/10/10 and anthropometric measuring at the 10-50 percentile. During observation, the newborn appeared well. Multiple petechiae were detected on the axillary, inguinal and popliteal folds and inferior area of the abdomen, with no other physical examination findings, including signs of bleeding or mucosal affection. A blood test was performed, revealing thrombocytopenia of 28000/ul, with normal remaining blood cell lines and negative C Reactive Protein. A dose of intravenous immunoglobulin was administered given the hypothesis of NAIT. Control blood test showed a minimum platelet count of 25000/ul 9h after immunoglobulin, increasing to 44000/ul after 18h. A second dose was administered after 24 hours. Platelet count then progressively increased, with 176000/ul by the 7th day. Diagnosis confirmation was possible by the 5th day. Parents' study revealed antiplatelet anti-HPA-1a alloantibodies in the mother. Parents' platelet compatibility test had a strong positive (4+) result. Platelet HPA-1 genotypes of mother, father and newborn were 1b1b, 1a1a and 1a1b, respectively. Presently, the infant is 2 months old, is clinically well with a platelet count of 415000/ul. Conclusion: An exhaustive physical examination of the newborn is essential, as some serious conditions may manifest with subtle alterations. In the differential diagnosis of isolated petechiae of the newborn, NAIT must be considered. The serologic and genetic testing are important to confirm diagnosis and to properly provide genetic counselling to the couple. Neonatology",

There also remains a large proportion of well babies who receive antibiotics and remain in hospital unnecessarily. Background: The homozygous EGFR mutation is associated with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease type 2. So far only a hand few of cases have been reported. Case Report: Preterm female infant, born at 28 weeks of gestation via emergency cesarean due to non-reassuring fetal status, weighing 650 grams. Her Apgar score was 4/7/7. She was intubated in the delivery room and transferred to the NICU. On physical examination she had several malformations (sparse scalp hair, craniofacial abnormalities, thin and long limbs, arachnodactyly, absence of subcutaneous fat, arthrogryposis) and a very fragile skin with extensive erythema. While in the NICU she required continuous mechanical ventilation due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. She presented with recurrent infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia requiring multiple courses of antibiotics and transfusions. Echocardiography revealed a severe congenital heart disease with ventricular disproportion with hypoplastic left ventricle, severe aortic arch hypoplasia, complete atrioventricular septal defect and a patent ductus arteriosus. She developed persistent hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and severe hypomagnesemia requiring frequent replacement therapy. Cranial ultrasounds showed tetraventricular hydrocephalus with severe periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions, cerebellum atrophy and a mega cisterna magna. Genetic testing identified the c.1283G-A, p.(Gly428Asp) mutation in homozygosity, in exon 11 of the EGFR gene. At 3 months of post-menstrual age the infant died of progressive cardiac failure, despite optimization of medical therapy. Conclusion: Homozygous EGFR mutation is associated with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease type 2 which presents with a complex and severe phenotype and overall bad prognosis, with no reports of successful therapy. The inheritance of this disease seems to be autosomal recessive, and thus consanguinity is a high risk factor. With this case we expect to help characterizing this extremely rare syndrome.",

Serological markers were negative. Five fetal ultrasounds were carried out. On the ultrasound performed at 30 1/7 weeks an opacity of the lens was identified raising the possibility of congenital cataract. This image was not present at last ultrasound (35 4/7 weeks). Delivery occurred at 41 weeks. APGAR 10/9/10. Measures at birth: weight 3680g (P85); length 51 cm (P50-85); head circumference 34 cm (P50). Physical examination was normal with the exception to the absence of red reflex in the left eye in D1 of life. An Ophthalmological evaluation as carried including echography that revealed left eye microphthalmia (15.9 mm) and poor and irregular dilatation, thus confirming the pre-natal diagnosis. At 2 months of age, she maintains follow up visit in Neonatology and Ophthalmology. At the last visit, a total cataract with vascularized membrane was identified. Currently active surveillance is maintained and surgical intervention is delayed. Discussion: Congenital cataracts, although rare, should be considered. A careful prenatal ultrasound study, complemented by the objective examination, namely with the evaluation of the red reflex, can lead to an early diagnosis. A possible association between maternal hypothyroidism, medicated during pregnancy and the occurrence of congenital cataract should be further clarified. Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) prevalence has increased over time. Different studies indicate folic acid (FA) importance in improving childhood behavioral outcomes and underline its role as a modifiable risk factor for ASDs. Modulations dependent reduced folate uptake and auto-antibodies against folate receptor alpha (FRAA) were associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Objective: A systematic review was conducted in both animal and human clinical studies to determine the association of FA with ASDs. Methods: Different keywords in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase databases were used to identify and select the eligible studies without language and date limitation. Two authors independently screened potentially eligible articles and extracted relevant data. Results: 43 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 8 were conducted in animals. 14 clinical trials investigated the association between maternal vitamin supplementation and the risk of ASDs in offspring; 10 studies investigated the role of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism in ASDs risk; 9 studies observed the clinical benefits after folate supplementation in ASDs diagnosed children; 2 studies investigated the frequency of serum FRAA in ASDs children. All of them associated maternal FA use to a significant reduction risk of the ASDs in offspring, particularly when assumed at least from 4 weeks before the start of pregnancy. Serum FRAA were present in 77.5% (31/40) of children with ASDs compared with 54.8% (23/42) of neurotypical development children in a 2018 cohort study. MTHFR 677T-allele frequency was found to be significantly higher in ASDs cases compared with nonautistic children. A recent study concluded that maternal FA supplementation (600\u03bcg) during first month of pregnancy may reduce ASDs recurrence in families with ASDs children.

Measurements: Lactation nurses completed daily audit for breast pump. Audited mandatory lactation consults, physician prescriptions, referral to clinic and any use of breastmilk at discharge for all infants discharged from the NICU. Results: Breast pump initiation improved from a baseline of 33% to 89% with PDSA cycles. Lactation consult including hand expression reached 100%.

Any Breast milk within 24 hours of discharge improved from 52.84 to 62.84%. Discussion: Improvements were driven through nursing education during the first PDSA cycle and through lactation audits in subsequent PDSA cycles. Lactation support for hand expression, education, and facilitating physician`s referrals to breastfeeding support clinic led to significant improvements in use of breastmilk at discharge. Regular audits, staff education and teamwork were the key drivers to success. Next Steps: Our future goals include monitoring of colostrum usage, lactation follow-up survey, and implementing donor human breastmilk.

            "text": "Background: Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts. Probiotics affect the intestinal ecosystem by impacting mucosal immune mechanisms. Enteral probiotics are commonly used in premature neonates with antibiotic associated diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolitis. Saccharomyces boulardii, a subtype of S. cerevisiae, is widely used as a biotherapeutic agent. However, fungemia with Saccharomyces cerevisiae can occur in weak and immunocompromised patients. We present the case of a premature infant in neonatal intensive care unit who was treated with probiotics and developed S. cerevisiae fungemia. Case presentation: A Korean female infant with a birth weight of 1,560g was born at 29+3 weeks of gestation via cesarean section delivery. The patient had feeding intolerance and abdominal distension, requiring parenteral nutrition by a peripherally inserted central catheter. At the age of 37 days, we started on the infant twice-daily treatment with probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii). After 14 days of receiving probiotics, the patient developed sepsis, and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated in peripheral blood cultures. We removed the contaminated central venous catheter and used a Fluconazole 10mg/kg/day. After antifungal treatment (fluconazole), the blood cultures were negative and the patient recovered clinically. Conclusion: Probiotics containing S. boulardii are commonly used to treat many diseases. In neonates, we should be cautious about the indication of their use, preparation, and administration, particularly if a central intravenous catheter has been inserted. Background: Cerebral abscesses in neonates are a rare clinical condition, with high morbidity and mortality rates, and usually arise in the setting of neonatal sepsis or meningitis. Case: Preterm male, delivered by caesarian section at 35 weeks of gestation due to intra-uterine growth restriction. He weighed 1515g, and the Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 min of life, respectively. On the 6 th day, the clinical status deteriorated and laboratory tests showed thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. The patient started an antibiotic regimen (cefotaxime, amikacin and vancomycin), even though the cerebroespinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal. A Serratia Marcescens was isolated in hemoculture. In 48 hours the patient developed hypertonia and irritability. The lumbar punction was repeated: CSF analysis confirmed the diagnosis of meningitis but cultures remained negative. Antibiotics were modified accordingly (amikacin and meropenem). A transfontanellar ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic circular lesions in the periventricular regions. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple supratentorial abscesses, evolving to cavitation accompanied by incipient porencephalic dilation of the left ventricle and diffuse cerebral edema (image 1). The neurosurgical council suggested conservative treatment with antibiotics (10 weeks) and follow-up MRI every two weeks. The final MRI showed cavitation areas (previous abscesses) and a Rhatke's pouch cyst. The baby was discharged at the 81st day of life with a normal neurologic examination. At 12 months, the patient has a mild psychomotor and staturo-ponderal retardation; the brain MRI shows chronic cavitary lesions. Conclusion: Serratia marcescens is a known cause of sepsis in neonatal intensive care units, frequently involving preterm patients with low birth weight. When there is neurological involvement by the infection, the prognosis is usually poor. The diagnosis and treatment of cerebral abscesses is a challenge for any neonatologist, given the absence of guidelines for the duration of treatment on this subject.",

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital in New Taipei city, Taiwan using data collected from January 2012 to December 2016.We enrolled newborn infants who were intubated in the delivery room or neonatal intensive care unit and who had a body weight of \u22641000 g at birth. The following data were retrieved from medical records: gestational age, birth body weight, body length (crownheel length), head and chest circumferences, and final ETT depth. Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 20.0 software. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between each variable and the ETT placement depth. Results were considered to be statistically significant if the P value was 0.05. Results: A total of 52 candidates were enrolled. The mean (range) gestational age was 25.1 weeks (22 to 32 weeks) and mean body weight (range) was 724.5 g (400\u25001000 g). There were 8 (15%), 22 (42.5%), and 22 (42.5%) patients with body weights of 500 g or less, 501\u2500750 g, and 751 g\u25001000 g, respectively. In linear regression, the relationships of ETT depth to gestational age, body weight, head circumference, chest circumference, and body length were all significant (P 0.001). Regarding the coefficient of determination (r2), body weight ranked first (0.497) and body length second (0.458), and all other parameters fell below 0.4. Conclusion: In ELBW infants, linear associations were observed between ETT insertion depth and assessed variables that are typically available at birth, including gestational age, body weight, body length, and head and chest circumferences. Although body weight is the most accurate parameter for predicting ETT insertion depth, body length is an equally useful alternative that is preferable during delivery room resuscitation.",

Introduction: Horner syndrome is a classic neurological syndrome which signs usually include miosis, ptosis and anhidrosis. It can be caused by a lesion anywhere along the sympathetic pathway that supplies the head, eye and neck. A congenital Horner syndrome should be suspected when anisocoria is associated with heterochromia. Scimitar syndrome is a congenital cardiovascular anomaly in which part or even the entire right lung is drained by right pulmonary veins that connect anomalously to the inferior vena cava. Case Report: A full-term male newborn presented with left palpebral ptosis, anisocoria and heterochromia. Cleft palate and a heart murmur were also present. During pregnancy, no complications occurred until the third trimester, when a dilated cardiac sinus was detected in a routine fetal ultrasound. Within the first three months of life cleft palate was surgically corrected and an echocardiogram was performed, revealing an interauricular communication with left-to-right shunt. Congenital Horner syndrome was suspected and, in order to rule out neuroblastoma, several exams were performed. Cerebral CT scan, karyotype and urinary levels of vanillylmandelic and homovanillic acids were normal. Thoracoabdominal CT scan revealed an alveolar infiltrate in the upper lobe of the right lung with evidence of anomalous drainage of most of the right lung to the inferior vena cava, suggesting Scimitar syndrome. Also, right cardiac chambers were found prominent, associated with a significant left-to-right shunt. The child is currently 21 months old and has reached every developmental milestone so far, with an adequate growth. A multidisciplinary team is currently following the case.",

Despite its high prevalence in the immediate post childbirth, high abandonment rates have been registered early in life. World Health Organization (WHO) and The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend six-first months' exclusive breast feeding and have been promoting the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) since 1992, already counting on fifteen accredited Hospitals. Objective and Methods: \"Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga\" (CHBV) has been intending to take part in BFHI since 2012. Therefore, we aim to analyse and compare newborns' feeding practices since birth till maternity leave from 2012 to 2018, using a retrospective study based on surveys completed during maternity stay. Our sample consisted in a variable number of surveys between 1307 and 1474 per year, of approximately 1700 annual live births. Results: We verified oscillatory exclusive breast feeding rates, maximum in 2015 (80%). Partial breast feeding rates have been increasing since 2015, maximum of 31% in 2018, while exclusive formula feeding rates remained steady around 1%. In what concerns first-hour breast feeding, the rate prowled 85%. Conclusion: Although several efforts in order to fulfil the criteria, CHBV is not an accredited institution yet. We have been facing many difficulties in achieving optimal long-term exclusive breast feeding rates, despite initial high levels of contact with breast milk. In fact, breast feeding duration depends on several multifactorial determinants, only some of which are modifiable, such as the availability of pre-birth training. Furthermore, it is mandatory some investment in mothers' formation about lactation and its technical difficulties, as well as optimization of health care professionals' training. It is also important to understand the main reasons for breast feeding abandonment and develop strategies to provide support within reach for every mother. Background: Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) occurs when maternal-fetal platelet incompatibility leads to formation of maternal antibodies and results in fetal and neonatal thrombocytopenia. Despite being a rare condition, it is the most common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia in the healthy newborn. Most cases have a mild presentation, but some can present with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Objective: To characterize NAIT cases in a level II hospital. Methods: Retrospective review of the cases of NAIT between 2014 and 2018. Data analysis was performed using SPSS\u00ae.",

Background: Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are skin lesions characterized by abnormal proliferation of endotelial cells and aberrant blood vessel architecture. They represent the most common tumors in childhood, affecting 5% of general population. Risk factors include low birth weight, caucasian race or female gender. In most cases, IHs are diagnosed based on disease history and physical exam. Manifestations are usually present before 4 weeks of age and growth is completed by 5 -8 months of age (proliferative phase). Then it starts to involute until it disappears, frequently by the age of 4 years (involution phase). It might occur ulceration and pain, and due to localization on or near vital structures may cause functional impairment or permanent disfigurement. Imaging is not usually necessary, but when performed, ultrasound is generally the preferred modality for diagnosis, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is requested to assess the extent of lesion. Although the majority of IH's resolves spontaneously, ulcerated IHs or near vital structures require early consultation with a dermatologist.",

Twenty-five children were diagnosed with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). These infants' mothers had a significantly higher serum Mg (p=0.035). This was not confirmed when corrected to gestational age (Wald p value = 0.783). No difference or correlation in newborn or mother Mg levels were found when analysing further adverse effects, ventilation days, parenteral nutrition dependency, NICU stay, or other outcomes.",

Previous reports and meta-reviews document positive outcomes in the avoidance of mechanical ventilation as well as reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia [2, 3] . During the last few years video laryngoscopes have become available for neonatal practice. The use of video assisted visualisation of the vocal cords makes application of surfactant via LISA easy and safe. Objective: We report 15 babies who received surfactant using LISA in combination with video laryngoscopy in a District General Hospital in the UK between March and December 2018. Methods: Babies had a mean gestational age of 34 weeks, with a range of 31 to 39 weeks. Indication for the administration of surfactant was increasing oxygen requirement, clinical impression of respiratory distress and rising capillary CO2 levels. All babies tolerated the procedure well with improvement in oxygen requirement, clinical assessment of respiratory distress and capillary CO2. There were no significant adverse effects. 3 babies were given atropine following procedure induced mild bradycardia. None of the babies were sedated. Conclusion: Our experience with delivering surfactant using LISA assisted by video laryngoscopy has been very positive. The use of a video laryngoscope allows less experienced operators to visualise the vocal cords safely under supervision [4] . This has a positive impact on the team as well as a valuable learning benefit. 6 out of 7 doctors performing the procedure felt that the video laryngoscope had improved their confidence and allowed the procedure to be performed less invasive compared to routine laryngoscopy techniques.",

Admission temperatures below 36\u00b0C are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Objective: To increase compliance of preterm infants' 32 weeks gestation having admission temperatures 36.5C-37.5C, as per NNAP standard, by preventing heat loss in the immediate postnatal period. Prior to this project our Unit's compliance was 59%. Initially we targeted compliance of 75%. Methods: We used the rapid-cycle Plan-Do-Study-Act method. Preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation who were born at a Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (University College Hospital -UCH, London, England) were enrolled. Our intervention involved a new education programme and standardising the management at delivery with a thermoregulation guideline (including use of transwarmer, plastic bag and hat). Importantly a major change involved increasing the ambient temperature in theatres to 26C (previously 23C) for those born in obstetric theatres.

Of the 3 that did not, all were hypothermic (36.5C), and in each case the theatre temperature was not increased to 26C (only 23-24C), although the rest of our guideline was followed. Conclusion: We reduced hypothermia in 32w gestation infants using a standardised guideline, and educating and involving the whole multidisciplinary team. Increasing ambient temperature in operating theatres is vital to avoid hypothermia. The PDSA cycles and weekly audits allowed for real time feedback helping to sustain the improvement.

Radiological study confirmed the diagnosis of congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle, showed an interruption in the medial region of the clavicle with rounded edges and no evidence of bone callus formation. The patient follow-up is in Children`s Orthopaedics outpatient. No more cases of clavicular pseudarthrosis were identified in 2018. Conclusion: Differential diagnosis, especially in neonates, mainly includes the clavicle fracture due to birth trauma. However, when the clinical findings are contradictory, this condition should be considered, with radiology being an important auxiliary. In most situations, an expectant attitude is adopted. Surgical treatment is recommended when there are functional limitations, progressive pain, onset thoracic outlet syndrome or unacceptable cosmetic deformity.

On P7 and P14, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from the rat pups. To assess alveolar development, four random, non-overlapping fields per animal in two distal lung sections were studied at 100X magnification. Results: Early postnatal LPS administration significantly increased neutrophil counts in BALF and PB and disrupted alveolar development, whereas prenatal LPS alone did not. The CXCR2 antagonist significantly attenuated neutrophil increases in BALF and PB and restored alveolar development in the rat pups exposed to early ponstnatal LPS. Hypoxic-ischemic encefalopathy (HIE) due to birth asphyxia occurs when there is an acute hypoxic-ischemic event that causes various sings and symptoms. The treatment of choice for this condition is therapeutic hypothermia, accompanied by supportive management. It has been available in Portugal since 2009 and currently there are 4 hypothemia centres. This restrospective study intends to characterize the patients with this pathology (HIE) in an ultra peripheral hospital. Since this hospital doesn't have the ability to treat with induced hypothermia, our eligible newborns were transferred to a central hypothermia centre. Clinical charts from 2011 to 2018 were analysed. The first patient submitted to hypothermia was in 2012. Of the newborns admitted to this Neonatology unit, 17 were diagnosed with HIE, 47% were male. 8 were transferred while 9 remained and received supportive management. From the newborns submitted to hypothermia treatment, 2 developed Cerebral Palsy (CP) while the rest are considered to have a normal psychomotor development. In the group that remained, 3 developed CP. 82% of patients with HIE suffered acute fetal distress, being late decelerations and sustained bradycardia the most common causes. 82% had neonatal seizures and were treated with phenobarbital. Head MRI or aEEG are not available, to the pediatric population, at our hospital, making it difficult to assess severity which may lead to unnecessary transfers. Risk factors were present in some patients: 1 uterine rupture; 1 cord prolapse and 1 case of HIE due to Fetomaternal Transfusion. This study intends to demonstrate how important it is to be able to diagnose this condition early to arrange tranportation that isn't always available in the small window we have to start treatment. Background: Newborn jaundice is one of the most common conditions for preterm infants. Phototherapy is the treatment of choice to reduce bilirubin levels.

Improvements can be much simpler to action when unit-based IRs are utilized. On the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, IRs were written but with varying quality as there was no formal structure; they consisted of freehand text on paper. Informal discussions with nursing staff revealed that they had reservations about completing IRs due to concerns of repercussions. These concerns are common in nurses who report incidents and are sometimes well founded. Excellence reporting was not utilised but has been recognised as another tool to aid patient safety.",

Polysubstance use was observed in 4 women. The psychotropic substances consumed were opioids (7), cannabis (5), cocaine (4), alcohol (1) . Three women were treated with benzodiazepines and could not step-down the treatment by the time of birth. Nine women confirmed tobacco consumption. Only 2 women did not present social risk factors. Of the 17 neonates, 8 were male, 3 were preterm, 11 were small for gestational age.

Since then, according to WHO, there are about 8.000.000 children born with IVF. In 1984 for the first time it was possible to transfer frozen embryos and in 1991 it was the first successful intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to treat mainly male infertility problems. ICSI is now used in more that 80% of couples treated with IVF. Data for neurodevelopmental outcome of children born with IVF are obscure and inconclusive mainly due to research methodology problems and to factors that can affect outcome such as IVF technique per se, ICSI, culture medium used, transfer of frozen of fresh embryos, the infertility problems and perinatal co factors such as prematurity, multiple birth, parental age. Literature data show a possible link with increased Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) incidence, ADHD, Specific Learning Difficulties (SLDs) and Behavioral problems such as internalizing and externalizing behavior especially with ICSI technique.

Nevertheless literature studies are of weak methodology mainly due to diagnostic criteria for ASD. In our population we studied medical records of 133 children with IVF history. Boys 61%, girls 39%. The educational level of mother and father was in the middle and upper range in 83 and 86% respectively. Mean paternal and mean maternal age at conception was 37 and 38 years respectively. ASD of any severity was detected in 9.02% of cases and of high severity in 1.5%. The relation between boys and girls in ASD cases was 2:1. ADHD detected in 8.2%, internalizing and externalizing behavior in 33.08% and SLDs in 26.3% Discussion: In our population we recorded increased ASD incidence amongst children with IVF history (9.02%). Nevertheless the incidence of severe cases were close to the general population (1.5%). In our IVF population there was weaker association between ASD and male sex compared to the general population (2:1 vs 4:1). Literature data need further evaluation regarding entry criteria, methodology and ASD diagnostic criteria in order to come in a clear conclusion between IVF and ASD. Background: Neonates are in high risk of developing blood stream infections because of their immature immune system. This is more in case of low birth weight and preterms who are at a higher risk than full term newborns. It is common practice amongst pediatricians to administer antibiotics to at risk neonates without evidence of clinical or microbiologically proven sepsis which has led to resistance to antibiotics. Objectives: To manage low infection risk preterms without antibiotics and determine their outcome; to find out relation between maternal risk factors, gestational age & birth weight with regard to need for antibiotics. Methods: Inborn Preterm babies with low risk factors for infection were closely monitored without antibiotics. Babies were started on antibiotics only when sepsis was considered. Detailed maternal history with regard to obstetric risk factors was recorded. Gestational age and birth weight were correlated with need for antibiotics. Babies were followed up till discharge or death.",

There was statistically significant difference in mean birth weight (1.765+0.37kgs) between neonates who required antibiotics and those who did not. (p-value0.001). There was no significant association of gestational age with need for antibiotics. Maternal obstetric risk factors had significant association with need for antibiotics in the babies (p-val-ue= 0.025). Three babies (4%) who received antibiotics developed NEC as against none in the non-antibiotics group. Only 2(16.3%) out of the 12 babies in antibiotic group had positive blood cultures. Mortality was 4.1% Conclusion: Preterms with low risk factors can be managed without antibiotics. Need for antibiotics is strongly associated with maternal obstetric risk factors and low birth weight. Background: Neonatal jaundice is a common condition in babies. Treatment with phototherapy often means babies remain in hospital or require readmission. The provision of home phototherapy services would reduce hospitalisation. It is a service that Heartlands Hospital is keen to develop and between April and November 2018 they trialled home phototherapy on 14 babies. Objective: Ensure compliance with our local guideline and gain feedback of family's experiences of the service. Methods: Performed a retrospective audit of our local guidelines, along with assessment for each baby of required blood tests and days phototherapy.

We received 12 responses from the questionnaires. 11 families had only good comments about the service. 1 family had mixed comments, however the negatives given related to equipment. Everyone commented on how home phototherapy had allowed them to be together as a family and all families said they would chose to use the service again. Conclusions: Home phototherapy was a popular alternative to treatment in hospital for all the families who received it. We did not identify any major problems during the trial period.

Time of birth and transfer time to NNU did not influence the admission temperature. Conclusions: Following the QI, rates of normothermia at admission improved from 52% to 62%. QI highlighted importance of establishing normothermia before transfer to facilitate normothermia at admission and hence the importance of actively measuring the temperature early during stabilisation and adjusting accordingly. Monitoring theatre temperature will be part of our continuous QI project. Background: The rate of admission to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) has increased in the past few years. There also has been an improvement regarding the outcome of these NICUs which include a decreased infant mortality rate.

Aim: To present the range and results of the active immunization at newborns, as well as the passive immunization from infected mothers. Hepatitis-B is rarely transferred through the placenta. The infection mostly happens during childbirth (except when the birth is performed with S.C.). Material and method: The subject of this research are data from the Medical documentation and the results from implemented active immunization at the Clinical hospital in Shtip during 2017-2018. Engerix-B has been used for the active immunization process, while the passive immunization is induced by using Hepatitis-B Immunoglobulin. The comparative analysis method and observation by age is used to present the results. Results: The total number of deliveries in 2017 is 929, of which 8 newborns are not immunized with active immunization. The total number of deliveries in 2018 is 878, of which 5 newborns are not immunized with active immunization. The cause for delayed immunization is due to low birth weight and illness of the newborns while being admitted at the Neonatal department. The passive immunization has been conducted at 5 newborns, whose mothers were infected with Hepatitis-B. All 5 children were delivered with natural birth, as it was not indicated to deliver the child with S.C. as a prevention of transmission of Hepatitis-B to the newborn. Once the immunization has been applied, the children were not separated from the mothers and they were fed by breastfeeding. The immunization, both active and passive, caused no side effects. Conclusion: With complete immunization against Hepatitis-B (active and passive), it is expected to reduce the incidence of Hepatitis-B and to reduce the number of most frequent complicationschronical Hepatitis-B, cirrhosis and Hepatocellular carcinoma.

Many studies associate a high level of this marker with disease progression, inflammation processes and fibrosis formation. Objective: To determine the level of Galectin-3 as a marker of fibrosis formation in children of an early age with pyelonephritis. Patients and Methods: We examined 100 children of an early age suffering from pyelonephritis. The level of Galectin-3 was determined by immunoenzymatic method (ELIZA) using the kit \u00abHuman Galectin-3\u00bb Results: High levels of Galectin-3 were discovered in babies suffering from vesicoureteral reflux (8,59\u00b11,03ng/ml). The concentration of this marker was significantly lower in children of the comparative group (2,97\u00b10,94 ng/ml) as well as in almost healthy children who were examined (1,5\u00b10,19 ng/ml), \u04400,01. The highest level of Galectin-3 was recorded in children who were 2-3 years old (10,3\u00b11,34 ng/ml) which was reliably different from the level in children aged from 1 month to 1 year (5,0\u00b10,76 ng/ml), (\u04400,05). It was established that the longer the duration of inflammatory process in kidneys, the higher was the level of pro-fibrotic factor. Thus, the reliably highest level of Galectin-3 (12,46\u00b14,21 ng/ml) was in children who were suffering from the inflammatory process in kidneys for 6 months or longer. The children examined after three months of illness showed the level of Galectin-3 which was two times less (7,03\u00b13,28 ng/ml), (\u04400,05). The lowest level of Galectin-3 was found at the beginning of the disease (5,67 \u00b11,64 ng/ml), (\u04400,01).",

It was established that the longer was the duration of pyelonephritis the higher were the levels of pro-fibrotic factors. Background: In Portugal hypertension affects around 13% of all children. Essential hypertension is the commonest. Renovascular disease is an uncommon, but important cause of hypertension in children, which includes renal artery stenosis (RAS). Case-Report: A two-year-old girl with a complex cyanotic cardiopathy (type B Aortic branch interruption, subaortic stenosis and a nonrestrictive intraventricular communication) submitted to two correction surgeries is admitted with fever, cough, rhinorrhea and anorexia. At observation she had a good general condition, with cyanotic lips and nails and no signs of respiratory distress and she was hospitalized for surveillance. During the hospitalization serial BP measures revealed hypertensive peaks and she initiated antihypertensive therapy with captopril and furosemide, with poor BP control. An echocardiogram was performed excluding an aortic recoartation and a renal ultrasonography revealed a small right kidney with diminished corticomedullar differentiation. During hospitalization there was no significant decrease in BP raising suspicion of renovascular etiology. A magnetic resonance angiography was performed revealing a stenotic right renal artery and distal aorta in \"sack bottom\"consistent with important vascular malformation. Captopril was progressively stopped, a calcium channel blocker was initiated and later a betablocker was added to BP control. After discharge a percutaneous angiography was performed confirming the vascular malformation making it impossible to revascularize. The Tc 99m-MAG3 renal isotope scan was also performed and revealed a right kidney with 36% function. Currently she has a multidisciplinary follow-up and maintains antihypertensive therapy with propranolol and amlodipine, with therapeutic readjustments periodically needed. Conclusion: Secondary causes for pediatric hypertension are variable, and should be suspected in children with early-onset hypertension. In a child with a repaired aortic coarctation a recoartation must be excluded as the hypertension etiology. Refractoriness to appropriate medical therapy should raise suspicion for renovascular etiology and CT or MRI angiography reveal the diagnosis. Background: Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in small vessels in children.

We emphasize the initial good corticosteroid response in the majority of our patients, but high incidence of relapses, steroid dependent and resistant disease during follow-up. The authors present 2 cases of Pyelonephritis xantogranulomatosa treated in the Clinic. This is a very rare form of chronic kidney inflammation with an unclear cause. The literature shows the relationship of the disease with disorders in urinary outflow, urolithiasis, infections and prolonged antibiotic therapy. The first patient was found to have doubled kidney and deposits in the kalyxes changed by inflammation. Both patients in the period preceding the diagnosis were subjected to long-term antibiotic therapy due to recurrent respiratory infections and chronic urinary tract infection. Treatment of the first patient was one-stage due to the intensification of the inflammatory process at the time of diagnosis. In the second girl, the abscess was initially drained, and due to the non-characteristic intraoperative image, the suspicion of xantogranulomatosis was made and confirmed in computed tomography. In the next stage, due to the expansion of the process -nephrectomy was performed. Proteus mirabillis and Escherichia coli were found in the cultures, which are also reported in the literature as the most common pathogens. It is interesting that despite the generalized inflammatory reaction, only one kidney is involved in the process. The diagnosis of Pyelonephritis xantogranulomatosa is difficult. In imaging studies, the kidney is enlarged, with a preserved shape, contains deposits in the calyx and pelvic system and numerous hypoechogenic changes indicating abscesses. Urography and renoscintigraphy may show a weak or inactive organ function. The test of choice is computed tomography, which allows to assess the advancement of the process. In differential diagnosis in children, the Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, clear cell carcinoma, inflammatory process like pyelonephritis, kidney tuberculosis, kidney abscess should be considered. In both described cases, the diagnosis of xantogranulomatosis was confirmed in histopathological examination. Qualification for nephrectomy was based on imaging studies (CT) and persistent high exponents of infection. In the follow up no complications were noted, the remaining kidney in both cases is functioning properly.

Patients may have an erroneous perception of their body size or a distortion of the size and shape of the objects around them.

So, it is important to be aware of these associations so that an early and accurate diagnosis can be made, and proper treatment and follow-up be performed. Background: Tay-Sachs disease is a neurodegenerative lysosomal disorder with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern caused by HEXA gene mutations. Children with this disease appear healthy at birth and psychomotor development proceeds normally during the first months of life. Slow neurological and development decline starts around 6 months. Clinical Case: The authors present an eighteen-month old girl, of nonconsanguineous parents, born of a full term bi-chorionic, bi-amniotic twin pregnancy, adequate somatometry at birth, with development delay noticed at the age of 6 months. We saw her at 18 months at our referral clinic. We identified eating difficulties, motor delay (unable to stand alone), poor visual contact, poor social interaction, no verbal language and an abnormal acoustic-motor response (startle). Mother refers loss of previously acquired skills (hand clapping). On examination we also detected an abnormal posture with neck extension, hypotonia, ataxia, brisk reflexes, optic nerve atrophy and macular cherry red spot bilaterally. No other system anomalies detected. Cranial MRI and EEG were normal. A Gangliosidoses was suspected, so we requested lysosomal biochemical study and deficit of betahexosaminidase A was identified, compatible with GM2-Gangliosidoses -Tay-Sachs Disease. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion: Gangliosidoses are rare diseases, at this moment without specific treatment, but its diagnosis is important for genetic counselling. A high level of suspicion is essential. The presence of a startle response and /or a cherry red spot should alert for these diseases. Background: Sacral fractures are uncommon injuries resulting from high-energy trauma. They are frequently underdiagnosed and mistreated, and so are their complications.

He reported no leg pain nor irradiation, no lack of sphincter control or any sensitive deficits. The neurological examination was normal and there were no cutaneous stigmata of occult spinal dysraphism. However, when asked to stand up, he began biparietal headache, nausea and several vomiting episodes, which improved when laying down and worsened with head elevation. CT scan showed a sacral fracture of S3 and a meningocele, previously unknown. MRI scan of the head and spine revealed collections of CSF between the posterior arches of C1 and C2, between C7-D1, D1-D11 and along the anterior sacral surface. It confirmed a cystic intracanal lesion between S2-S4: a meningocele with probable spinal dysraphism associated and a recent fracture of S3 with potential laceration of the meningocele and opening of a CSF fistula. Our diagnosis was CSF hypotension, secondary to the fistula opening. The child was in bedrest for two weeks, under watchful waiting in neurosurgical care. Subsequent control MRI showed significant CSF absorption with meningocele refilling and the child started to ambulate gradually. Conclusion: The final diagnosis was challenging. The child presented with symptoms of CSF hypotension with no evident cause. The discovery of the meningocele led us to hypothesize a possible opening of a fistula, which is a rare diagnosis, later confirmed by MRI. children.

Her physical exam showed repetitive clonic movements affecting the right hemiface, including tongue and soft palate on the right, and orbicularis oculi muscle. Blood tests, lumbar puncture and the initial brain-MRI were normal. The first video-EEG revealed abundant focal paroxysmal activity in the left frontocentral region frequently associated to clonic movements in the right hemiface. She was started on antiepileptic drugs, but there was a progressive clinical and electrophysiolgical worsening, with almost continual paroxysmal activity, despite the several drugs used. Immunosupression was initiated with systemic corticotherapy and intravenous immunoglobulin infusions, with reasonable seizure control. Serial brain-MRI evaluation revealed signal changes in left cortical and sub-cortical areas in the precentral gyrus, as well as cortical atrophy. Clinical, neurophysiologic and brain imaging data suggest the diagnosis of RE. Conclusion: For the general pediatrician, the early recognition of an EPC is crucial, since it generally has a complex etiological diagnosis, whose functional prognosis can be very difficult. Even so, the early initiation of a targeted therapeutic intervention may help to address the potentially disabling effects of EPC. Background: Cortisol is a corticosteroid present in body fluids and controlled by the Hypothalamic-Hypophysis-Adrenal (HHA) axis, which under equilibrium conditions maintains the circadian rhythm, and is activated in stressful situations. Thus, measurement of salivary cortisol can provide important information about the functioning of the HHA axis under normal and stress conditions, as well as the involvement of cortisol in the mechanisms that determine activity and adaptation to environmental changes. Stress situations can cause cortisol to be produced in greater amounts than usual, and cortisol levels strongly influence brain function, with reports of decreased attention levels. Thus, it was hypothesized that the increase in salivary cortisol levels is correlated with the low test performance that evaluates the attention, in this study the sustained auditory attention.

We describe a 15 year-old female who came to the emergency department complaining of dizziness, unsteady gait, diplopia and pain in the hands and feet with a few hours of evolution. The patient reported vomiting and diarrhoea about two weeks before symptom onset. Her vital signs were normal. The neurological assessment revealed bilateral VI nerve palsy, ataxic broad-based gait, arreflexia and limb dysesthesia. Lower limb strength was slightly reduced. Routine blood tests were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid examination didn't show albuminocytologic dissociation (first day of disease) and was negative for the presence of oligoclonal bands, gram stain, culture and polymerase chain reaction for neurotropic viruses. Cranial and medullar magnetic resonance imaging was normal with no cranial nerve enhancement or thickening of the cauda equina. The serologic study revealed evidence of acute infection by Coxsackie virus. The electromyography was normal and serum anti-gangliosides and anti-neuronal antibodies were negative. The patient received intravenous immune globulin with clinical improvement noticed at day two of treatment. Complete recovery was achieved in four months. MFS is a rare, self-limiting condition and its diagnosis is based on the presence of the typical clinical triad. The albuminocytological dissociation is not present in a majority of cases in the first week of symptoms.

Methods -Case Report: A healthy five-year-old male, without antecedent illness or history of obvious trauma, presented with holo-cranial headaches, deviation of the right labial commissure, and left hemiparesis twelve hours before admission to the hospital. At admission, computed tomography (CT) was normal, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed recent stroke in the cortical region and deep distribution within the right middle cerebral artery. The child was initially treated with subcutaneous low weight heparin and oral acetylsalicylate acid. On the third day, he presented with a severe headache, including vomiting. Repeated CT revealed an increase of intralesional edema in the areas of subacute infarction without hemorrhagic transformation. On the fifth day, neck vessels Doppler ultrasound revealed signs of right internal CAD. After diagnosis of CAD, the patient started therapy with warfarin. During hospitalization, there was improvement in loss-of-strength and regression of the deviation of the labial commissure. There were no additional symptoms, and the patient was discharged after thirteen days of hospitalization.",

In addition, in igfbp3-null mice, a decrease in phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2 significantly reduced PSD-95 expression, and GAD65/ 67 expression was significantly decreased. Conclusion: These results indicate that IGFBP3 deficiency impairs neuronal structure and signaling. In behavioral studies, igfbp3-null mice were hyperactive, and a Y-maze alternation test revealed impaired spatial working memory, but no anxiety-like behavior.

No sphincter complaints. Family history of an uncle and grandfather with similar symptoms, but no definitive diagnosis. General physical examination was normal. He had normal cognitive development, but showed lower limb increased osteotendinous reflexes, and discrete cavus feet. Routine laboratory findings were normal. At this point, the adolescent was referred to a Neuropediatric center. Neurologic evaluation revealed a spastic paraplegia, lower limbs hyperreflexia with right ankle clonus and bilateral Babinski. Brain and medulla magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Further investigation included a hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG) genetic panel, which allowed the identification of a pathogenic gene mutation, on BSCL2 gene (SPG 17), which is associated with a dominant type of SPG. He is under physiotherapy treatment, and two years after diagnosis, he manages to walk independently. Discussion: Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a syndromic designation for a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders, in which the main neurological symptoms and signs are lower limb spasticity and weakness. In childhood, the most prevalent are SPG 3 and 4. Clinicians should be aware of this diagnosis, especially when combining both clinical symptoms/signs with similar familiar history. Despite the positive family history, this was the first case with a genetic diagnosis, allowing family genetic counseling.",

He was unconsciousness and had stiff neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, no abnormal findings. His blood gas was normal. (No lactic asidosis.) Results of brain MR and CT imaging showed a lesion in the left occipital lobe with long T1, T2 signals,left shift and edema. On follow up, brain edema treatment was started and was commenced on ceftriaxon and acyclovir. All viral serology that could be cause of encephalitis and autoimmune encephalitis panel came back negative. Although he received antibiotheraphy,IVIG and pulse steroid treatment, his clinical findings and swelling/herniation were worsening so he was undergone decompressive craniectomy. The brain biopsy was determined non-specific encephalitis findings. MR angiography/venography was normal. The blood genetic test suggested a mutation of mt.3243AT, so we got diagnosis of MELAS. After being treated with arginine and coenzyme Q10, the patient dramatically improved. Case Presentation: A previously healthy 26-month-old boy, brought to the emergency department due to imbalanced gait and muscle strength decrease, with two days of evolution.

Conclusion: Authors pretend to emphasize the challenges in the diagnosis and management of paediatric CIDP. Despite being a rare diagnosis, clinical suspicion, early recognition and investigation with prompt management can result in better outcomes of this potentially treatable neuropathy. We also highlight the importance of corticosteroids in this pathology, contrary to it role in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Conclusion: There is a significant finding of a low sodium blood levels in the first hour after the SFS.We strongly recommend oral electrolyte fluids during fever in children who experienced SFS. There is a significant result that the IDA is very common in children with SFS as preexisting condition. Consequently, iron is a better marker than hemoglobin.We strongly recommend iron+ vitamin supplementation and parental nutrition education.Further investigations are necessary to explain the possible role of the sodium blood levels in the etiology of SFS in predisposed children. Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a rare condition in children (0.6-7.9 / 100.000 year), more common in boys (~60%), associated with heart conditions, hematologic changes, vasculopathies, metabolic disorders and drugs. In infants, AIS typically presents with seizures and altered mental status, while older children present with focal deficits, hemiparesis, visual disturbance or cerebellar signs. Anamnesis and neuroimaging, CT-angiography or MRI, are essential for timely diagnosis and intervention. Further investigation includes blood tests, ECG, and echocardiography.",

Case Study: M.D.G., complained of ocular pain 2 days prior to admission and presented with headache and vomiting, followed by facial asymmetry and slowed speech. Past medical history of an AVM in left sub-scapular region. On examination a right hemiparesis with homolateral facial involvement, past pointing on the right, and ataxia. Full blood count, biochemistry screen and CSF results were normal. CT scan was normal but cranial MRI revealed a left anterolateral pons lesion, confirming early stage AIS. Echocardiogram was normal. Prothrombotic factors were not identified. LMW-heparin and acetylsalicylic acid were initiated promptly as well as a rehabilitation program. Cranial MRA revealed occlusion of the distal 1/3 of the basilar artery and no other evidence of a vasculopathy. On cervical MRA the vertebrobasilar circulation was not directly related to the AVM. Clinical and angiographic course were favorable. Discussion and Conclusion: Diagnosis of AIS in children is difficult and requires a high level of suspicion. In this age group etiological investigation is essential to identify treatable causes. In our patient we could not identify usual causes, nor syndromes associating AIS with AVM. We question if the AVM could be responsible for a \"steal\" syndrome resulting in AIS. Background: ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder.

We emphasize that leukocyte, lymphocyte, erythrocyte and platelet count are significantly higher in obese children related to inflammatory status in this condition. The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity in the world leads to more and more health problems throughout life. \"Interventions to prevent childhood obesity by changing dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviors have not proved to be very effective, and did not significantly improve BMI\" (Anderson, 2010) \"There is increasing evidence linking the stress response to obesity and the metabolic syndrome\u2026. A novel approach to preventing obesity is to help children develop healthy emotion regulation, controlling their physiologic and behavioral responses to emotions that arise from psychological stress\" (Anderson, 2011) The Emotional Feeding Model (EFM) is suggested as a novel approach to nurture the emotional well-being in early childhood and to prevent obesity and its outcomes, eating disorders, child neglect and abuse. Feeding and family mealtime`s experiences in early childhood nurture the emotional, social, as well as cognitive and motor development. The common daily situation of feeding and mealtimes serve as learning and & When caregivers feed the child mechanically or force feed him, it creates the toxic stress and unhealthy environment that might damage his brain development. This has far-reaching effects of his psychological, social and physical development. It is of great significance and in our responsibility to guide and train young parents, as well as professionals working with young children, in how to create an environment that nurtures the emotional well-being and prevents the toxic stress and its damaging outcomes. Introduction: Myopericarditis is a rare complication of Epstein-Barr infection, with nonspecific symptoms. Case description: A 9-year-old boy, with no relevant past medical history, was admitted to ER with a two week history of intermittent pleuritic chest pain, vomiting, nausea, anorexia and periumbilical pain. In the last ten days he also had productive cough and unilateral knee pain, but no inflammatory signs and in the last month he had high fever and nasal symptons for eight days. At the admission he was afebrile, with a normal physical examination. Blood tests revealed elevated biochemical markers of liver injury (AST 361U/L, ALT 604U/L, FA 214U/L and GGT 105U/L) with normal liver function, elevated serum creatine kinase (998U/L) and cardiac biomarkers (troponin I 19.1ng/ mL, CK-MB 122U/L). Chest radiography was normal. The electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5 and V6. Myopericarditis was the initial diagnosis and after Pediatric Cardiology evaluation AINE therapy was initiated. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Investigation revealed no active infection for hepatitis A, B and C, cytomegalovirus, herpes I and II and adenovirus. IgM and IgG antibodies to viral capsid Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) antigen and to nuclear EBV antigen were positive. Early antigen antibodies to EBV were negative. The positive EBV DNA pointed out a recent EBV infection with hepatitis and myopericarditis. Chest pain resolution was observed on day three and improvement in transaminases and cardiac biomarkers on day five; electrocardiogram showed flattened T waves on aVF, V5 and V6. He was discharged to Pediatric Cardiology follow-up consultation and he remains asymptomatic with normal ECG. Discussion: Myopericarditis is a rare disease, often caused by viral infections but exact etiology remains undetermined in most patients. This report highlights the importance of considering this diagnosis as a rare presentation of a common infection. Introduction: Kawasaki disease (KD) is one of the most common childhood vasculitis although its aetiology still remains unknown. It is a systemic inflammatory illness that particularly affects medium-sized arteries, especially the coronary arteries. The most feared complications include aneurysms and ischemic disease. Most cases occur in children younger than five years and rarely in those younger than six months. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of this clinical entity at the main University Hospital of Algarve. Methods: A retrospective study was performed through the analysis of epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic data of hospitalized KD cases between January 2004 and June 2019. Results: A total of 22 cases were obtained. The ages ranged from 3 months to 8 years, with a median of 22 months, and subjects were predominantly male. There was a higher incidence in the months of June and December. At presentation, the majority had exanthema, ocular and mucosal involvement. The time of fever prior to diagnosis ranged from 1 to 15 days, with an average of 6 days. All had an echocardiogram, 8 had echographic alterations, of which 6 had aneurysms. All patients started treatment with immunoglobulin until the 10th day of illness, except for three patients who had a late diagnosis. They also all started acetylsalicylic acid therapy. The length of hospitalization ranged from 2 to 21 days, with an average of 9 days. Half of the patients will continue to be followed by pediatric cardiologist, and there were no deaths. Three of the six cases of aneurisms still have some degree of coronary dilatation and one patient underwent cardiac catheterization.",

An early diagnosis is critical to achieve optimal treatment results and a better outcome. Congenital pericardial anomalies are very rare, and manifested as pericardial cyst, diverticulum and absence of pericardium. As an acquired and localized pericarditis manifested as a constrictive pericardial band causing strangulation and hourglass shaping of ventricles has been rarely reported in adolescents and adults, but this type of congenital pericardial anomaly has not been reported in neonates. We report a case of congenital pericardial fibrous band causing strangulation of both ventricles, diagnosed at fetal life and confirmed after birth. At 22 weeks of gestation, a fetal echocardiography showed an unusual ring-like constriction of both mid-ventricular cavities and multiple mass-like lesions in the both ventricular cavities, suggesting cardiac tumor. Both ventricular systolic and diastolic functions were within normal limits. After an uneventful pregnancy, the baby was born at 38 +3 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 3.3 kg. Echocardiography showed a pericardial fibrous band causing strangulation of both ventricles, extending from mid left ventricular (LV) lateral wall, diaphragmatic surface of both ventricles, lateral wall of right ventricle (RV) and into the RVoutflow track. A three-dimensional cardiac computed tomography also showed the same findings. There was no definite cardiac tumor. The baby was asymptomatic and discharged home 4 days after birth. At 6 months of age, the baby was still asymptomatic, but echocardiography showed a merged pattern of mitral inflow Doppler and mitral annular tissue Doppler imaging, along with mild dilatation of both atria, suggesting an early stage of ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Close follow up is needed to assess ventricular functions and to decide necessity of any surgical intervention timely.",

Material and Methods: The data is classified according to the age, heart auscultatory finding, echocardiography, pregnancy risk factors, gestational age . Results: 250 children were examined with diagnosis FO. According to heart auscultatory finding 225 (90%) had systolic murmor 1-2/ 6 degree precordial, 25 ( 10 %) did not have any murmors. By their age, the infants of 0-6 months were mostly affected, 150 (60%), then those of 6-12 months-80 babies (32%) and 20 (8%) were at the age of 12-14 months. Acording to the anamnestic data from the mothers, only 45 (18%) were with complications during the pregnancy and child complications after the birth. By gestational age, 177 (70,8%) children were delivered in term in 40 th gestational week (GW), and only 73 ( 29,2 %) were preterm births in 33-36 GW.Echocardiographic examination showed the folowing results: 174 (69,6 %) had only FO , 76 (30, 4 %) ,the rest had more complex congenital heart defects, such as: 30 (12%) with Ductus arteriosus persistens, 18 (7,2 %) with mild degree of pulmonary stenosis, 12 (4,8 %) with Defectus septi ventriculorum perimembranous , 10 (4 %) with Defectus septi ventriculorum muskulrum , 5 (2 %) with Tetralogy of Fallot and one child (0,4%) with dextrocardia. Conclusion: Parents of children with FO should know that their children are healthy without any physical disabilities. In 20% of the population with FO it persists in older age and can result in migraine and paradoxical embolism with a stroke and it is the reason for dual attitudes should the hole be closed in school age. (1.5-16.5 ) years, respectively. Median (range) cumulative Anthracycline dosage administered prior to HSCT was 318 mg/m 2 (135-604 mg/m 2 ). None had radiation therapy before HSCT. Echocardiographic systolic and diastolic functional parameters, especially using tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), within 1 month before, 6-month and 1-year after HSCT were analyzed. Results: Left ventricular ejection fraction, shortening fraction, mass and end-diastolic wall thickness did not change significantly after HSCT, but left ventricular end-diastolic dimension decreased significantly after HSCT. Mitral inflow Doppler indices did not change after HSCT. TDI S' velocity showed transient, but significant decreased at 6 month in mitral septal annulus. Mitral septal and lateral annulus TDI E' velocity decreased significantly at 6 month and 1 year after HSCT, but tricuspid TDI E' velocity did not change significantly. TDI myocardial performance index in the mitral septal and tricuspid lateral annulus increased at 6 month and 1 year after HSCT, and mitral lateral annulus TDI myocardial performance index showed transient increase at 6 months after HSCT. Conclusion: This study showed that significant changes, although subclinical, in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions occur after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients. Close follow-up study is mandatory in this population to elucidate the long term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on cardiac functions. Background and aim: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis with an acute and self-limited course. The incidence of KD is differs widely among ethnic groups and countries which may reflect both a genuine increase in disease burden and increased disease recognition . Limited patient series have been reported from countries in the Middle East our aim of this study is to describe the demographic ,clinical presentation, echocardiographic data , treatment options and complication of children's diagnosed with Kawasaki diseases over two years duration from (2013) (2014) (2015) in state of Qatar Methods and material: A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted at main tertiary hospital in Qatar , Children hospitalized in our pediatric department with KD from January 2013-December 2015 were included. it include details of demographic, clinical presentation of Kawasaki disease, echocardiogram finding and treatment option offered for the patients Result: There were 133 KD cases, with typical KD in 111 (84%) and Atypical in 21(16%).Male to female ratio was 1.3:1 and median age was 30 months. presenting symptoms frequency were as follow :Fever were in 100% of the patients from which 32% were diagnosed on day 5 of fever and 65% on day 7 and by 2 weeks 94% were diagnosed .Conjunctivitis and lymphadenopathy were reported as common as 66% of the total patient followed by skin rash in 63% and Strawberry tongue 59% .Irritability was common also in 57 % of the patients. Desquamation was the least frequent symptoms in 33% of the total patients. Echocardiographic (ECHO ) done for 51% of the patients in the first week of the illness and 96% by the end on 2nd week , reported normal in 75% and abnormal in 25% . Nearly 98% of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin. Conclusions: The epidemiology and cardiovascular outcomes in our study are similar to other predominantly international European-Caucasian populations. Management decisions in our center is following the standard evidence based medicine treatment . our study showed a good numbers of cases diagnosed with Atypical KD , further description looking into possible risk factor and cardiac outcome is required",

Neonatal arrhythmias can causes life-threatening conditions. Objective: To clarify the mechanisms of development of heart rhythm disorders in newborns by assessing the state of autonomic regulation of cardiac activity. Materials and Methods: Holter ECG, analysis of heart rate variability (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN indices, rMSSD, pNN50), statistical analysis. Results: The study involved 187 newborns with cardiac rhythm disturbances at auscultation of the heart. All the newborns were administered Holter ECG, following which they were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 126) -newborns with heart rate and conduction impairment, Group 2 (n = 61) -newborns with no rhythm and conduction disorders. Taking into account the gestational period, Group 1 and 2 newborns were divided into subgroups of full-term and pre-term infants: Group 1a -full-term with arrhythmia (n = 34), Group 1b -pre-term with arrhythmia (n = 92), Group 2a -full-term without arrhythmia (n = 24), Group 2b -pre-term without arrhythmia (n = 37). SDNN and SDANN factors, SDNN and pNN50 indices were higher in the subgroups of full-term newborns (46,5 [33,0; 64,0] and 46,0 [31,0; 54,0]; 28,5 [19,0; 35,0] and 27,0 [20,5; 36,0]; 34,0 [21,0; 53,0] and 34,5 [21,5; 39,5] ; 1,01 [0,33; 5,66] and 0,8 [0,31; 2,73] ). The rMSSD values were higher in the 1a subgroup (16,5 [11,0; 40,0] ), which indicated a higher activity of the parasympathetic link of the autonomic nervous system in full-term infants with arrhythmias. Conclusions: Assessment of heart rate variability in newborns is an important component of the characteristics of the heart rate; gestational immaturity of the vegetative centers and imbalance of the vegetative regulation are arrhythmogenic factors. Background: The most common causes of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are congenital abnormalities in individuals 0 to 13 years of age, presumed primary arrhythmia in those 14 to 24 years of age, and coronary artery disease in individuals 25 to 35 years of age. Coronary artery aneurysms are extremely rare in paediatric population and mainly due to the sequelae of Kawasaki Disease. Objective: We herein report a case of undiagnosed giant coronary aneurysms leading to SCA in 15-year-old previously well male patient. Methods: A 15-year-old Caucasian male presented with sudden out of hospital cardiac arrest during a moderate exercise activity. He was successfully resuscitated and received one direct cardioversion by AED. AED recorded ventricular fibrillation. His past medical and family history were negative for cardiovascular disease as well as Kawasaki disease. Results: His physical examination and the 15-lead ECG were unremarkable. Initial echocardiogram demonstrated dilated left ventricle with reduced systolic function. 24-hour ECG recording showed frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopics. Exercise testing demonstrated ST depression in the inferior leads. The CMRI study was diagnostic showing several small subendocardial areas of infarction and giant aneurisms with thrombi involving proximal left anterior descending and mid left circumflex coronary arteries. The patient was commenced on anticoagulation therapy and he had an S-ICD implanted. He was discharged home on beta blockers, ACEI and Warfarin. He remains under follow up. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the importance of comprehensive evaluation and diagnostic workup in survivors of SCA. Coronary pathology although rare should be considered as possible aetiology of SCA in childhood, even in case of no clear history of Kawasaki disease. Our case illustrates the usefulness of advanced imaging modalities such as CMRI to identify a rare cause of cardiac arrest. In patients not previously identified as high risk, secondary prevention is as important as primary prevention. Introduction: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common arrhythmia in children. SVT may manifest as self-limited paroxysm, or on the contrary as a prolonged dysrhythmia with the subsequent development of cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and multiple organ failure. Cardiac disease associated with an inborn metabolic disorder (IEM) can present as an immediate life-threatening pathology with symptoms affecting growth and development, or as a \"silent\" disease with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Case Presentation: We report two cases of children who were initially admitted for supraventricular tachycardia, but who have been later diagnosed with an IEM. Our first patient, a four months old infant, presented in the emergency department with irritability, inappetence and tachypnea. He was diagnosed with SVT and found to be hemodinamically unstable, so he required electrical conversion to sinus rhythm. The initial clinical and biological evaluation pointed towards cardiogenic shock and multiple organ failure. Echocardiography revealed the presence of eccentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Acylcarnitine profile was also evaluated, indicating a low free carnitine level. Treatment with oral carnitine led to normal carnitine values at following visits and a good cardiologic outcome, without other SVTepisodes. Our second patient, of one year and two months, presented two episodes of SVT, at two months interval, both occurring during an infectious episode. Both episodes responded promptly to adenosine therapy. Echocardiography indicated a dilated left ventricle, with preserved systolic and diastolic functions. Shortly after the second episode, the patient presented another infectious episode with fever, vomiting and many loose stools, without cardiac rhythm disturbances associated. He presented in the emergency room, where the biological evaluation uncovered severe metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap, which does not respond to classical rehydration therapy, revealing also ketonemia and increased ammoniemia. A spectroscopic MRI examination of his urine sample indicated high levels oh methyl-malonic acid, establishing the diagnosis of methyl-malonic acidemia, However, the patient died 44 hours after admission.",

Background: Syntomatic Esptein-Barr virus (EBV) acute infection is more common in adolescents and young adults, classically manifesting as infectious mononucleosis. Although this is a common disease, complications are rare. Objective: to report rare complications of EBV infection in one child. Methods: We present the case of a 10 years old child admitted for persisting fever (medicated with amoxicillin PO for a tonsillitis a week earlier), associated with vomiting and abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium. The blood count revealed: WBC 13700 (N 68%), CRP 5,3mg/dL, ALT 31U/L and AST 240U/L and the abdominal ultrassound showed an acute acalculous cholecystitis. She was medicated with cefuroxime and metronidazol ev. After 2 days, she suddenly began chest pain, hemoptysis, respiratory distress, hypoxemia, paleness, tachycardia, hypotension, pulmonary crackles and hepatomegaly. Biochemistry revealed WBC 16900 (N 78,4%), ESR 45mm/h, AST 224U/L, ALT 79U/L, CK 1361U/L, CK-MB 211U/L, LDH 1377U/L, CRP 18.38mg/dL, D-dimers 6536ng/ml, Troponin 8184ng/L, NT-proBNP 33530pg/mL. EBV serology was positive. Cardiac monitorization showed ST segment elevation. Thoracic-CT revealed ARDS and right pleural effusion and the showed biventricular dysfunction and pericardiac effusion, compatible with cardiogenic shock. Inotropic therapy was started and she was transferred to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, under mechanical ventilation. On admission, the patient was hemodynamically unstable with an episode of ventricular tachycardia and was treated with amiodarone, adrenaline and dobutamine. She was discharged under treatment by carvedilol, linisopril, ivabradine, espironolactone and furosemide, but kept a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Conclusion: The initial clinical presentation suggesting mononucleosis and the positive serology for EBV were essential to establish the diagnosis of acute myocarditis, a rare complication of EBV infection. Kawasaki disease (KD) combined with pericardial and hemorrhagic pleural effusion is very rare. We report the case of refractory atypical KD in 10months-old infant who was initially manifested in fever, nonsuppurative conjunctival injection, red fissured lip, BCG site injection, respiratory failure and gastrointestinal symptoms. She was noted pericardial and pleural effusion in echocardiogram, so we did pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis, and exudate pericardial and hemorrhagic pleural effusion were revealed. Treatment with infliximab after the failure of high dose methylprednisolone and repeated intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, resolved KD symptoms and pleural effusion. Echocardiogram showed normal coronary arteries during and after the entire treatment period. This case would help clinicians recognize initial presentation of atypical KD with pericardial and hemorrhagic pleural effusion. Background: In recent years the number of children travelling abroad has substantially increased. The possibility of enteric fever should be considered if a patient presents with fever after visiting an endemic area. Case Description: We present a case of an eight-year-old girl and her tenyear-old brother, both previously healthy, whom were admitted to the emergency department with a febrile disease six weeks after returning from Malawi. They had not taken a pre-travel appointment and therefore didn\u00b4t receive any additional vaccinations or malaria chemoprophylaxis. After being initially diagnosed with a respiratory infection and treated with Azithromycin they returned, after four days, due to persistent fever, nausea, intermittent vomiting, abdominal pain and constipation. Routine laboratory tests showed an elevated C-reactive protein and elevated transaminase enzymes. Malaria tests results, viral serologies and stool cultures were negative. Our female patient had a positive Widal test which motivated a presumptive diagnosis of enteric fever. Salmonella typhi was isolated from a blood culture obtained from her brother. Both patients were treated with intravenous Ceftriaxone for 14 days with complete resolution of symptoms. Approximately four weeks after discharge our female patient was readmitted with high fever and anorexia. Widal test was positive and Salmonella typhi was identified in a new blood culture. The patient was initially treated at home with azithromycin but given the persistence of fever she was readmitted to the hospital and started intravenous Ceftriaxone. After eight days of Cetriaxone she reinitiated fever and knee pain. An ultrasound was performed and identified bursitis. She completed 14 days of Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Amikacin and was discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: This case draws attention to a disease that remains a major health problem in many developing countries. Early recognition of the syndrome and possible relapses is critical to the institution of appropriate therapy.",

The commonest cause of diarrhoea in children is rotavirus. In the tropics, more cases of diarrhoea occur during the dry season (between Oct-April) and this also corresponds to the peak seasonality period of the rota virus infection. Rotavirus vaccine is yet to become one of the free vaccines in Nigeria hence, children here still suffer from severe form of the rota virus infection. Objectives: The study's aim was to determine the prevalence and other associated factors of diarrhoea during the disease peak period at a tertiary hospital in South East Nigeria. Method: Data of children who had diarrhoea and presented to the Children Emergency Room between October 2018-March 2019 was extracted from their records. Data was analysed using the SPSS version 22. Results: A total of 1,167 children were seen at the Children emergency room during the period under study and of this 377 children had diarrhoea giving a prevalence of 32.3%. Males accounted for 56.6% of these cases. 82.8% of the children had severe to moderate dehydration with 1.6% of them having hypovolemic shock. The commonest age affected was the 12month old (13.3%) however the mean age of affected children was 20months. A total of 8 (2.4%) children died and the average duration of hospital stay was 2 days. Conclusion: The study shows that diarrhoea is still here with us and more work needs to be done in making sure that our children don't die from the disease. More health education to care givers and more advocacy is needed so as to ensure that the rotavirus vaccine is free. ",

It creates negative impact in many aspects: disruption in continuity of patient care, long waiting times for new patients, waste of clinic and hospital resources. Our aim was to explore why patients may not show for their appointments and to make potential recommendations to decrease the non-attendance rate Methods: Prospective study of patients referred to general pediatrics out patients' clinics at Sidra Medicine-the newly opening tertiary children hospital in Qatar from June 2018-sept 2018, phone interview-based survey conducted and were performed by the unit clerk of clinics. Survey included details from patients exploring different reasons of not attending clinics although previously patients' families confirmed attendance by phone call reminders. Result: 2036 patients were schedules to general pediatric clinics. 883 they attended the clinics, 899 they canceled /re-schedules the appointments and 254 were no-show. The phone interview included 254 out of 1140 of all patients confirmed initially attending clinics in phone call reminder. The main reasons identified of no show up were: no answer of the call back 143/ 256(55%), the time of clinics is not suitable with parents 44(17%),parents forget the appointment 26(10%), family work issues(5%)patients/parents were sick (4%), patients clinically improved(3% ), no available transportation (3 %). Discussion and conclusion: The international benchmark for primary care clinics of no-show is 10%. In our observation the no show rate were 20%. Identified multiple reasons of no show it is similar to the international ones. Initiating new strategies to decrease no-show in the clinics like revisiting cancelation policy, modifying working hours, appointment reminders via sending telephone massage with option of choice of appointments will decrease patients waiting, reduce health care cost and maintain full capacity scheduling of the clinics. Background: Sports Related Concussion (SRC) is a traumatic brain injury that has been defined as a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces with several common features that help define its nature.

A physical examination was performed and a CT was requested. Serious intracranial injury was excluded by neuroimaging, the diagnosis of concussion has been established and the child was discharged, with surveillance of the alarm signals. A brief period of physical and cognitive rest was advised followed by a gradual program, which included 10 steps with 3 medical evaluations. A return to play was achieved with no complications. Objective: Encourage paediatric care providers to follow-up after an SRC to monitor recovery and help with return to school. Ensure the importance of spreading the SRC prevention and management for teachers, staff, students and parents. Methods: The literature on paediatric concussion was reviewed. A case report of a 7 years old child was detailed. A graduated return to school and sport was designed. Conclusion; Although most concussions solve without complications, they may occur, especially when concussions are not recognized or are sustained multiple times, which include post concussion symptoms, second impact syndrome, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The applicability of implemented tools like Child SCAT5 baseline testing can be a key for better interpreting post-injury test scores. Continued efforts to train and educate practicing and future physicians about concussion diagnosis and management should be promoted to better serve patients. Background: A cutaneous horn consists of a keratotic projection that resembles a spicule or cone. Cutaneous horns of the eyelid are uncommon and even rarer in paediatric age. Typically, they grow in elder people with light skins and on sun-exposed areas. A variety of histopathological findings can be associated with this lesion. Clinical Case: A 4-year old girl presented to the urgency room with an upper eyelid lesion of the right eye. This lesion had 4 months of evolution. At examination she had no complains but pain with localized pressure. A minor haemorrhage happened the day before and motivated her consultation. This lesion had already been seen both at primary care center and general paediatric urgency before. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids have been applied with no improvement. At this point, a referral was made to Ophthalmology. The clinical diagnosis of a cutaneous horn was made and she was sent to the ambulatory clinic for further investigation and excision biopsy.",

Even though most of these lesions in children are benign, a careful management should be followed due to the possibility of a premalignant or malignant transformation at the lesion's base. Objective: the present study aims to analyze the body composition, through the children's arm anthropometry at the beginning of school age. Method: this is a cross-sectional study using a database of a cohort of elementary school students from municipal and state schools in Florianopolis, aged between 7 and 8 years. Measurements were obtained from the arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) and Arm Muscle Area (AMA), Arm Fat Area (AFA) e Arm Total Area (ATA) were calculated. There were obtained mean, median and standard deviation and rated the percentiles of the indices according to Frisancho's referential. Correlations of AMA, AFA, ATA e TSF between boys and girls were analyzed. Results: there was no statistically significant linear correlation of the Arm Muscle Area (AMA) between boys and girls, there was a statistically significant correlation of the Arm Fat Area (AFA) between boys and girls, and there was a strong linear correlation of Arm Total Area (ATA) between boys and girls. There was a statistically significant negative linear correlation of Triceps Skinfold Thicknesses (TSF) between boys and girls.",

            "text": "Regarding the year of publication, articles from 2005 to 2018 were used. Results: The results showed that for an adequate measure of BP in children, a quiet environment, an appropriate cuff, and technical knowledge are important. In addition, guidelines have shown that for diagnosis of target organ damage and concomitant clinical diseases, a BP measurement, medical history, including family history, physical examination, laboratory investigations, and other diagnostic tests is required. Conclusion: It is difficult to use screening to predict which children and adolescents will have high blood pressure as adults, there is limited information on blood pressure cuff accuracy in the diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents, and evidence of inappropriate use, incorrect calibration, or lack of this material in outpatient clinics. Background: The surveillance of AEFI is important to improve the vaccine safety and also to build public confidence in immunization's effects. The lack of confidence in immunization`s benefits and the fear of possible side effects are the main reasons why there is a refusal to vaccination. Objective: To analyze the adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in 0-16 year old children and to quantify the rates and severity of these events. Methods: This prospective study was conducted in 3 family medicine offices between the 1st of January 2017 and the 31st of December 2017 (2445 vaccine doses administered).During appointments for vaccination, parents were given information concerning possible AEFI and were advised on how to act, should these reactions appear, including reaching out to the family doctor by telephone or e-mail. There were records of adverse reactions being noticed by parents and by medical personnel and recorded following the methodology of the National Center of Control for Infectious Diseases. Results: There were records of 283 minor AEFI in the first 2 to 10 days following vaccine administration, which consisted of 11,57% of the total vaccine doses administered. The adverse reactions were: moderate or low grade fever, food intake behavior disorder, sleep behavior disorder and mild local reactions. There was no need of emergency care treatment or clinical admission. Conclusion: The evaluation and analysis of AEFI confirms the low rates of occurrence and the lack of severity compared to risk of the vaccine preventable disease. The active involvement and counseling of parents in reporting possible AEFI gives them responsibility, lowers the unease about possible reactions and heightens vaccination acceptance rates 284 Primary Care Utilization of Medical Facilities by Children in Japan at Night and During Holidays Akira Ehara 1 1 Faculty of Health Services Management, Hiroshima International University, Japan Background: Population of children under 6 years in Japan is decreasing from 6,761 thousands in 2005 to 6,031 thousands in 2015. Compared with the past, today`s parents are raising fewer children. It is probable that they do not have an enough experience with treating children`s illness and that they bring their children even with a mild illness to medical facilities not only in daytime but also at night and holidays. (Table 1) . Table 1 . The number of the fee charged for a patient`s first visit. (First visit/1000 person-months) Hospitalization of infants and toddlers was also growing from 0.48% in 2007 to 0.86% in 2017, and the rate was highest at midnight (from 3.55% in 2007 to 7.59% in 2017, Table 2 ). Table 2 . Hospitalization rate of infants and toddler at first visit Conclusion: Most of parents bring their children to medical facilities in daytime, and they tend to refrain from utilizing medical facilities at night and during holidays when their children have a mild illness. Introduction: Spending time outdoors is an essential part of an active and healthy lifestyle. On average, the first 18 years of age account for 25% of an individual`s total sun exposure. However, the time in the sun without adequate sun protection is responsible for 50-80% of the deleterious effects of accumulated exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), particularly for its carcinogenic action. Objectives: To assess the level of knowledge and to understand the children/adolescents and their caregiver's habits regarding sun protection, in outpatient, our Pediatric emergency department, Hospital level II, and in the child health consultation of a local USF. Methods: Cross-sectional study in which was applied a questionnaire about knowledge and habits concerning sun protection. Frequency tables and chi-square tests were applied, statistically significant p 0.05. Results: Sample totaled 295, 63.7% caregivers and 36.3% young people under 18 years. The period of the day of greatest exposure to sunlight was after 4:00pm (78.3%). They use sunscreen, 93% of children/adolescents and 90.6% of caregivers, however, the majority of the population only use it on the beach (61%) (p0.05). As for the frequency of renewal of sunscreen, 40.2% of the children/adolescents renewed two times, and 52.6% of the caregivers only once (p0.05). It is the female who responds to use more umbrella (76%) (p0.05) and more girls use SPF 30+ (59%) and 50+ (73.7%) while more boys use SPF Conclusion: The present study's data point to the need for a wider dissemination of adequate knowledge, both by the media and by physicians, to nurture healthy practices regarding exposure to the sun. The multidisciplinarity between primary health care and Pediatrician becomes crucial. (1) In Romania, 24.5% of children aged 5 to 19 years are obese (2016, NIS) Aims: Introduction of Intrafamilial Predictive Model (MIP) -Preventive interventional mechanism applicable to the child with the role of reducing the risk of major chronic diseases in the future adult Method: Between 10.2017-04.2018, we developed a prospective observational interventional cohort study, including two groups of 36 children (study group-control group) aged 6-18 years old, sex ratio girls: boys 2: 1, average BMI(body mass index) 27, coming from families struggling with chronic diseases: HBP(high blood pressure), dyslipidemia, diabetes. Clinical parameters were recorded: 3 visits for every patient over a period of 6 months: Weight, Height, BP(blood pressure), PA(abdominal perimeter), BMI (2, 3, 4). Based on these data, a MIP has been prepared and a schedule of recommendations for the child and the his /her family has been developed and applied (5). Results: After 6 months: -10% weight loss in children -Reduction of Systolic BP values averaged by 15mmHg in girls and 10mmHg in boys -Daily sports activity -average 60 min -Professional orientation for children with static vertebral disorders -30 min every day-spending quality time with family (sport, dinner) Conclusions: Obesity remains the main common, identified major risk factor (MRF) in the studied patient. MPI allows the early identification and evaluation of MRF in childhood with a possible role in the etiology of chronic diseases in adulthood. MPI allows the development and implementation of a personalized, cost-effective program, based on education for health. Future study is needed for a larger group of children to allow correlations between RF(risk factors) and chronical diseases occurrence. Pediatric department, LCC\"ISIDA-IVF\", Ukraine Background and aims: As in vitro fertilization (IVF) are increasingly used to overcome infertility, there is concern about the health of the children conceived via IVF. It is important to follow up these children and evaluate whether they have elevated health risks compared to naturally conceived children. Inspite of big amount of researches, it is still not enough information to make an accurate assessment of health of children, born via IVF technologies. Methods: We monitored 81 children born in 2016 -2018 years via IVF and 102 naturally conceived children. We assessed the morbidity during the first year of life in children conceived naturally or via IVF. Results: Children conceived with use of IVF were more likely to have anemia (OR 1.21 95%CI 0.47 to 3.13), diseases of gastrointestinal (OR 1.84 95%CI 0.70 to 4.83) and genitourinary systems (OR 2.55 95%CI 0.22 to 28.71), also they are at higher risk of the skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases (OR 1.17 95%CI 0.57 to 2.39). We observed that children in research group have significantly lower risk of acute respiratory infection (OR 0.88 95%CI 0.49 to 1.58), neonatal diseases (OR 0.81 95%CI 0.41 to 1.83), eye (OR 0.30 95%CI 0.03 to 2.79) and ear diseases(OR 0.41 95%CI 0.01 to 10.32). Conclusion: Children conceived by IVF were at significantly increased risk of anemia, diseases of gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems, also they are at higher risk of the skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases, when compared to those conceived by spontaneous conception. We think that further large scale research should be undertaken with long-term follow-up to assess the morbidity of IVF conceived children. Background: According to the data of numerous researches, in the recent years the situation, with respect of children's health is unfavorable: number of absolutely healthy children has reduced, frequency of functional disorders has increased, 68% of the pre-school children has multiple functional disorders, 13.5% has physical development anomalies and 17% of them has chronic diseases. Structure of chronic pathologies has changed; share of the digestive organs, locomotion and nervous systems has increased. There are many cases of body posture anomalies, myopia, impairment of the functional capabilities of cardio-respiratory system and this plays significant role in organism resistance reduction and high morbidity. Objective: Goal of the research was complex evaluation of the health status of the primary-school aged children residing in various regions (urban, rural) of Adjara. Methods: Cross-section, one-stage research was conducted in the City of Batumi and village Tsikhisdziri. In the process of survey health status of children of 4 public schools, from 6 to 9 years old was studied. Public schools' selection was provided by cluster randomization method. Observations covered up to 800 school children in total. Screening included consultations of the multidisciplinary group of specialists, additional laboratory and instrumental studies intended for the purpose of accurate diagnostics. Results: Performed studies showed that 28.3% of the studied population was actually healthy, 55% had functional disorders and 16.7% -chronic diseases. Prevalence of both, functional disorders and chronic diseases was tow times greater in the 6-7 years' group, compared with the group of 8-9 years-old children. Conclusion: Negative trends in health status of primary school aged children, given the regional characteristics, evidences necessity of timely identification of the key causes of morbidity and adequate diseases' management and this is of great importance, with respect of reduction of the children's morbidity burden. Background: A 2 year old girl presented to hospital with severe lethargy, pallor and increased work of breathing on a background of regression of motor and cognitive skills; having previously been able to walk she was now unable to weight bear. The girl was drinking up to 2 litres of cow's milk daily and eating little solid food. Blood tests revealed a haemoglobin of 11.7g/L (94-130) MCV 63f/L (87-103) and ferritin of 12ug/L (15-150). She was stabilised with a blood transfusion. Echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular dysfunction alongside a pericardial effusion. MRI brain revealed generalised volume loss with prominent sulci, subarachnoid spaces and ventricles (see figure  1 ). After investigations into potential haematological, metabolic or malabsorptive causes, a diagnosis of severe iron deficiency anaemia was made. Objective: Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common mineral deficiency of childhood (WHO 2017) and is known to be associated with cognitive impairment and developmental delay (Lozoff 2006) . Iron is essential for brain development and iron deficiency has been demonstrated to produce structural brain changes on MRI in animal models (Mudd 2018). We wondered if there were any previous studies finding structural brain changes in children as a result of iron deficiency anaemia. Methods: Systematic literature review Results: We found no evidence of any previous studies reporting structural MRI changes. One case series (Munot 2011) reported on 4 children aged 14 months to 4 years with ischemic stroke as a result of IDA. Conclusion: While it has been shown that iron deficiency produces developmental impairment, it has yet to be elucidated how the deficiency directly affects the brain in children. This case shows a severe case of Iron deficiency anaemia with associated widespread volume loss. Further neuroimaging studies are required to characterize the effect of iron deficiency anaemia on the brain in childhood. In the Philippines a law that ensure that cases and instances of abuse are closely monitored at school level. However in 2015 Department of Education reports an increasing trend in bullying. This study aims to determine the socio-demographic profile of bullying among grade 6 students enrolled in a Public school in Manila. This is a Cross-sectional Study. Grade 6 students were chosen by cluster sampling and 3 classes were included. Participants were asked to answer a questionnaire. Data were arranged in tables expressed percentages. Chi-square test was done to determine the association of variables.Results showed that 84% said they were bullied by other children, 77.2% bully other children. Verbal bullying was the most commonly experienced type by victims and done by perpetrators. Frequency of bullying for both bullies and victims happened less than once a week (61%). Retaliation (53%) is the most common reason of bullies and for the victims they are bullied just for fun(43%).Majority of the bullies felt guilty after they have bullied other kids(40%), while most of the victims felt nothing after they were bullied(23%). Majority of the students (81%) reported that the most common reaction of teachers to bullying incidence they have witnessed was stopping the act immediately and resolving the matter right there and then. Those who are bullied others have higher incidence of being bullies (83.9%) than those who were not bullied (47.1%). There is no significant association between sex and being bullies or being bullied by other students. In conclusion, there is a high percentage of bullying in a public elementary school in Manila despite an existing law against bullying. Programs which may increase bullying awareness must be done in schools. The Department of Education together with the national and local government leaders and the whole community should work hand in hand to be able to lessen if not eradicate bullying in our country. ",

            "text": "Backgrounds: Varicella is a highly contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus. Most commonly, virus is affecting children, teens and young adults. Incubation period is usually 14 days. Varicella-zoster virus enters in the body through the respiratory system. Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by measles virus. Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7-10 days. Measles virus spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of infected people. Varicella and measles are important infectious diseases because they can cause severe complication even death in young children under one year. Methods: A 4 year old girl came on exam four weeks after the onset of the varicella rash. She came with high fever over 40C, caught, vomitus and decreased appetite. Physical examination shown signs of pharyngitis. Blood test showed normal leucocytes and high elevated CRP. After 5 days of antibiotic therapy, she came on exam, still febrile over 39-40C, with drowsiness and decreased appetite. Second laboratory findings revealed normal leucocytes and reduced value of CRP. Two days after, she was hospitalised, still febrile, dehydrated, with drowsiness and presence of red maculopapular rash in the body, starting from the head through the corps. Girl wasn`t immunised with MMR vaccine. Results: First laboratory findings revealed leucocytes 5,4x109/l (Ne69%,Ly24%), CRP 96mg/d (6). Second laboratory findings revealed leucocytes 4,0x109/l (Ne58%,Ly35%), CRP 24mg/dl (6). Test for Measles (IgM positive) confirmed the disease. Conclusions: Varicella and measles are highly contagious infectious diseases. They are diseases that cause a big decline in immune system and can cause severe complications. Also, they are diseases that can be prevented by a vaccine. Therefore, it is recommended regular immunisation per calendar to prevent the occurrence of the diseases as well as to reduce the complications and mortality from these diseases, especially from the measles. Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the leading causes of genital cancer in both genders. The HPV vaccine is recommended by the CDC for children 14 years and above. Still, many countries do not include the HPV vaccine in their immunization schedule. Awareness of the families about the virus itself in addition to the availability of the vaccine is essential to prevent cancer-related viruses in the future. Objective: To explore the HPV vaccine in Qatar, a rapidly developing country that does not include the HPV vaccine in its immunization schedule. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire conducted in SIDRA medicine, the only tertiary pediatric hospital in the state of Qatar. Results: 232 questioners were completed (response rate from parents is 94 %). Almost 60% of participating parents were between 30 and 39 years of age. 60% of the parents were not aware that human papillomavirus could cause cancer. More than 75% of the parents felt confident about the idea of giving their children the HPV vaccine to prevent genital cancer. Unfortunately, 90% of the parents stated that their primary care physician has never mentioned HPV vaccine. When asked about their idea for the suitable time for HPV vaccination, 41% of the parents stated that it should be before a child is mature, while 22% stated it should be given before marriage. 12% of the parents stated that the decision about the HPV vaccine should be left to the children when they become adults. 25% of parents do not have an opinion. Conclusion: A large proportion of parents residing in Qatar have a positive perception regarding the HPV vaccine. We will share the result of our study with the ministry of public health in Qatar with a goal to incorporate the HPV vaccine in the national immunization schedule.",

The experts' recommendations are: no screen time below 18 months, for children 2-5 years limited screen time to one hour/day, for children \u22656 years there should be limits on the time spent using media and the types of media. Objective: The authors aimed to evaluate how much screen time the children are exposed to during the day. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study in February 2019 assessing the time children spend in front of a screen. This is a pilot study. The patients were enrolled in the Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Children's Hospital. Parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire containing screen time, type of screen, behavior related to screens. Results: Fifty one patients were enrolled in one week. Mean age was 7 years 3 months, sex ratio M/F=1.04/1, 78.4% came from urban areas. The parents declared the children started using screens at an average age of 3 years (minimum 6 months). 9.8% of children were exposed to screens below the age of one. The devices used were smartphones, tablets, TV, laptop, gameboard in 74.5%, 41.1%, 35.2%, 27.4% and 19.6% respectively. Children used screens alone on average 3 hours/day, 5.4 days/week and alongside their parents on average 2.2 hours/day, 5.2 days/week. In half the cases, a device was used during meal time. 25.4% of parents declared they use screen time as reward and 47% felt taking the child's device to be an effective punishment. 11.7% of children were falling asleep with the TV on. Conclusions: Screen time for children is progressively increasing as the age of exposure decreases. The most frequently used device is by far the smartphone. The screen related behavior is \"educated\" in the family. Background: ulcer (LU) is an uncommon disease characterized by vulvar ulcerations with sudden onset in nonsexually active girls or young women. It has a diagnosis of exclusion, discarding sexually transmitted ulcers, autoimmune diseases or trauma lesions. Most cases are idiopathic but several viral and bacterial infections have been envolved. Objective: We report a case of acute onset of vulvodynia presented in emergency department (ED). Methods: Case report Results: A 13 years old female presented to pediatric ED reporting acute vulvar pain and dysuria for the last 24 hours. Fever, mialgias, rhinorrhea, astenia and odynophagia had begun three days before. Genital examination showed two ulcers with red border and a central gray-black eschar one in left labia minor and the other in vulvar haipin. Blood test showed discrete leucocitosis and C-reactive protein 30 mg/L. Influenza A/B test, urianalysis and throat swab test for Group A Streptococcus were negative. The ulcer swab culture was also negative. We started oral and topic analgesia (lidocaine 2%) and warm stiz baths. Two days later, she reconsulted at primary care associating cough and otalgia with diseminated wheezings and right acute otitis media at physical examination. She started inhaled bronchodilators and based on the suspicion of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae (MP) infection, oral macrolide was prescribed. Two days after she was afebrile with better general conditions. Serological tests showed EBV, CMV, HSV negatives and IgM MP positive in 1/256. The ulcer complete healed in about two weeks with no scarring.",

Background and Objectives: Vaccination has made an enormous contribution to the population growth and mortality rate decrease. The Portuguese National Vaccination Program includes 8 vaccines against 12 target diseases. Although some vaccines are not yet present in the program, they are considered safe and effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate opinion amongst primary healthcare workers about vaccines not included in the National Immunization Schedule (NIS). Methods: An observational and descriptive study using a questionnaire to primary health care professionals about vaccines not include in NIS. The study had two phases (2017 and 2018), separated with clinical sessions and pamphlets distribution. Results: 58 health professionals participated in the survey in 2017, of which 66% were nurses and 34% doctors. In the second questionnaire (2018), 83 health professionals were interviewed (53% nurses and 47% doctors). An average of 12 and 15 years of professional activity was observed in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Of the study participants, 54 (91%) in 2017 and 82 (97.6%) in 2018 addressed the topic in primary health care appointment. The most recommended vaccines were against rotavirus and Neisseria meningitidis B. Approximately 19% in 2017 refer that they did not feel comfortable discussing these issues with parents, a value that decreases to 2.4% after clinical sessions. The main reasons for the lack of initiative to recommend were monetary value and lack of knowledge. Considering the professional category, it was observed a difference in the recommendation of rotavirus (p-value 0.004), hepatitis A (p-value 0.036) and human papillomavirus virus (p-value 0.035) vaccines in 2017 questionnaire. Most participants agreed with human papillomavirus virus in the male genre, but only 22.4% and 51.2% recommend it. Conclusion: This study allows to recognize motivators and barriers that are important for identifying intervention points for improving the approach of this topic with parents. ",

It is administration of pathogens or their parts in order to improve an individual`s immunity to a particular disease. The aim of mandatory National immunization programme is to achieve and maintain 95% immunization coverage of the entire population. Children should be vaccinated according to the National immunization schedule. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunization coverage of children born from 1997. till 2008. year according to the National immunization programme in Indjija, Srem District, Republic of Serbia and to determine the reasons for their incomplete vaccination at the time of conducting the cross-section.

Results: There have been 3366 medical records of schoolchildren, born from 1997. till 2008. year. Vaccination coverage was above 95% in all volumes, except in one (1998. year of birth), it was 94.8%. The total immunization coverage was 96.6%. Parents refused vaccination for 35/ 3366 children, 1.03%. Incompletely immunized were 77/3366 children, 2.28%. Medical reasons for incomplete vaccination had 11/77 children, 14.3%. Between nonmedical reasons for incomplete vaccination vaccine deficiency 11/77 (14.3 %) and family removal 26/77 (33.7%) were the most common. Conclusion: Immunization coverage according to the National immunization program in the schoolchildren in Indjija was in accordance with the recommendations(95%). It is necessary to point out the importance of organizational measures and parental education about the necessity of vaccines to reduce the percentage of refused and incomplete vaccination. Introduction: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals #3 \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages\". Noncommunicable diseases are recognized as a major cause of illness and death globally. In this context, chronic and disabling (rare) conditions are receiving increased attention. To meet the challenge of sustainable healthcare, cooperation between all involved in child health should be supported. tools to improve health for all. Preventive child health, as well as management of chronic diseases, follow schemes that can be aligned with international semantic terminologies. How can person-centred care, contribute to healthy lives? Methods: Patient representatives of people with a rare condition designed a Unified Modelling Language (UML), as a graphical language software, to support personal health management: https://rarecare.world. A checklist based on preventive child health schemes was designed to identify recognizable features and diagnostic tests of rare conditions at primary care level. Characteristic symptoms were linked to international terminologies applicable in primary care; the International Classification of Primary Care, Human Phenotype Ontology and Standard for identifying health measurements, observations, and documents. Each symptom was associated with a disease using the International Classification of Diseases. Results: Rare and disabling conditions present in preventive child health with recognizable features where schemes include data on birth, family history, physical examination, development and growth. For each rare condition, an application programming could be provided to link the features to preventive schemes. Conclusions: Regardless of the chronic condition, the development of a generic set of skills and tools will allow individuals to manage their own illnesses and improve health outcomes. Different rare conditions have served as examples of a promising model for early recognition and better care of the disabled child. ",

Methods: Case reports Results: A 7 years-old male consulted to us at primary care because of a purpuric rash that had started on the extremities 5 months prior to presentation. On physical examination the patient appeared as a well-developed healthy infant. He had a patchy, poorly demarcated light-purple to reddish hyperpigmentation over the trunk and the extremities. No associated disease, significant drug exposure, or contact allergens were found. Routine laboratory test including coagulation were all normal. Punch skin biopsy revealed perivascular mononuclear infiltrates with extravasated erythrocytes and few hemosiderin deposits in the upper dermis without apparent damage to vessel walls.

It's usually presented as a brownishblack, dirt-like plaques, in patients with normal hygiene. The lesions often affect the neck, ankles, trunk and face. This condition is most frequently seen in children and adolescents but doesn't have a predilection for any gender and is also unrelated to any known genetic condition or familial inheritance. Objective: Raise awareness amongst pediatricians for an early diagnosis of this condition, as it could save children from unnecessary investigations and treatments. Case Presentation: A 16-year-old adolescent girl with a personal history of type I tuberous sclerosis and epilepsy presented at her regular pediatric consultation for her annual follow-up with an asymptomatic brownish dirt-like lesion at the anterior region of the thorax with some weeks of evolution. Both the patient and her mother thought the lesion was dirt and tried to clean it by rubbing it with water and soap without success. There was no history of an inflammatory dermatosis in the area or other dermatologic conditions before this. There was also no history of bad hygiene habits. At the consultation, rubbing the lesion with an 70% isopropyl alcohol-soaked gauze pad and applying pressure resulted in complete disappearance of the lesion, therefore, the diagnosis of terra firma-forme dermatosis was confirmed. After this consultation the adolescent girl manifested frequent recurrences of the lesions, mostly in both her arms, which always disappear after she applies an alcohol-like solution. Conclusion: Both diagnosis and treatment of Terra firma-forme dermatosis consists in the application of 70% isopropyl alcohol. It's important to recognize this condition and not confuse this benign and easily treatable condition with other dermatologic disorders in order to avoid unnecessary exams and medications.",

The parents have noticed he had a dimple on both his shoulders which made them worried that was pathologic. There was no family history of these kind of dimples that was known to them. On physical examination deep dimples were present in the acromial region bilaterally and symmetrically, 10mm in diameter, about 5 to 10mm deep and without dermal or hypodermic atrophy. No other somatic abnormalities were found. There was also no restriction in range of movement of the shoulder joints. Conclusion: Bi-acromial dimples may be considered an anatomic curiosity. However, it is important that pediatricians are aware of this entity in order to reassure parents of its benign nature. It is of special interest to look for this abnormality in several generations, but familial observations are not necessarily associated with a genetic syndrome. In this case biacromial dimples were an isolated anatomical peculiarity, with no known familial occurrences. Skin dimples were discovered incidentally and are most probably underdiagnosed. Background: The non-qualitative provision of health services is a certainty in Greece and concerning the difficult economic situation in the country, the problems are constantly increasing. Despite advances in science, the successive meetings of responsible in Health Care Services, specialization in the management of Health Care, it is clear the inability of a concerted effort to improve quality. At international level, a comprehensive reorganization effort is being undertaken to identify weaknesses, find appropriate solutions and establish quality assessment systems. Objectives: To highlight the need to create a National Agency for Quality in Health and to develop quality assessment systems. We identify shortcomings in terms of both quality and security and present possible proposals at the level of structures, processes and outcomes for the efficient management of the above weaknesses. Methods: A bibliographic research was made using papers and online literature to identify and review relevant articles. Results: Electronic prescribing, automation of regular outpatient appointments, adopting international treatment protocols on daily and serious medical issues, the \"thirst\" of younger doctors to further specialize in their subject of interest, the plethora of research work at university departments and the attempt to gradually renew more and more departments in Public Institutions, show change. Conclusions: With the proper management, specialized administration in the field of Health Units, rehabilitation and prioritization, a new road opens up with the ultimate goal of the sustainable development of Quality and Safety Systems in the field of Health. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar. Results: 302 questionnaires were completed by caregivers of children with special needs (response rate 92%). 70% of children had developmental delay,20% had musculoskeletal disabilities, remaining had respiratory compromise(on non-invasive ventilation),learning,visual and hearing disabilities.92% of the children had multiple comorbidities Regarding their children's dental problems,45 % stated multiple problems(pain, cavities, halitosis, broken teeth, and teeth discoloration),whereas 10% complained only of cavities. Upon inquiring about oral hygiene habits care of their children, around 70% reported daily use of toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash. However 8% of them performed no oral hygiene routine. 70% of children didn't have a routine dentist visit in last year due to reasons such as long appointment time(25%),difficulty in c h i l d`s m o b i l i t y ( 1 7 % ) , p e r c e p t i o n t h a t d e n t a l c a r e i s expensive(9%),lack of dentist's experience in dealing with children with special needs (5%), and combination of the above factors(25%). When asked of what factors will encourage caregivers to acquire a dental home for their children, 63 % mentioned quick appointments , followed by dentists specialized in children with special needs (51%), child friendly atmosphere(21%),low cost(26.6%), close to home (20%),and others (6%). Majority of parents(75%) believed that the primary pediatrician of their child should initiate the dental home process. Conclusion: Children with special needs lack proper oral health care, and it could be attributed to the lack of a dental home. The primary pediatrician's role is crucial in initiating the process of acquiring a dental home for this special population. We will share our results with the ministry of public health of Qatar with a goal to provide awareness among primary care physicians to consider oral health as an important aspect of the overall wellbeing of such children and to create an easy referral system to obtain a dental home.",

Skin testing and specific IgE levels are useful diagnostic tools but predict probability, not necessarily the severity of allergic reactions. Children with early-onset severe AD have the greatest risk for positive IgE testing to foods. Objective: Aim was to analyze the association of AD and food allergies among infants with AD in our primary care setting. Methods: Retrospective analysis of our patients 1-12 month of age with AD and food allergy, in a period of 3 years (2015-2018). Descriptive statistical analysis was used. Results: Overall 70 children age 1-12 months had AD. 43 boys (61.4%) and 27 girls (38.6%). Median age for AD was 5 months. Associated food allergy was found in 23 children (32.8%), of which 19 (82.6%) had moderate to severe AD and 4 (17.4%) had mild AD. Most patients 17 (73.9%) had strong positive skin testing for egg and peanut, with elevated specific IgE levels (mostly class 4), 4 patients (17.4%) had positive skin testing for egg, cow's milk and soy, with specific IgE levels mostly class 3, and 2 patients (8.7%) had positive skin testing for wheat and soy, with specific IgE levels mostly class 3. All children were referred to pediatric dermatologist, elimination diet was introduced only to infants with confirmed food allergy. Most infants 20 (86.9%) with AD and food allergy were breastfed. Conclusion: Among foods that have been implicated in refractory, moderate to severe AD, egg and peanut are the most common triggers, only 5% of all our infants with AD had a clinically relevant milk allergy. Testing should be considered when infants have severe AD refractory to standard treatments, and a history of a reaction to food. Background: Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma. It is occasionally associated with pleural effusion and empyema, but rarely is complicated with pneumothorax. We present a case of a previously healthy child with a pneumonia complicated with pneumothorax. Objective: To report a rare complication of pneumonia and our approach. Case Report: A previously healthy 2-year-old child was admitted due to a four day history of cough and high fever. On the day of admission he presented with difficulty breathing and pleuritic pain. He had completed pneumococcal vaccination. On admission, the child was afebrile, with no signs of respiratory distress, oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Pulmonary auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side. Chest radiograph presented with a condensation of the right medial lobe. He was admitted with the diagnosis of pneumonia and started treatment with ampicillin. After eighteen hours his clinical state deteriorated with worsening tachypnea and desaturation. Chest radiograph (Figure 1 ) revealed right pneumothorax and a chest drain was placed. He developed subcutaneous emphysema, which extended to the neck, thorax and abdomen. There was a good clinical evolution until the 4 th day of hospitalization when he presented with respiratory distress, worsening of the emphysema and increased oxygen needs. A second right hypertensive pneumothorax was diagnosed ( Figure 2 ) and repositioning of the chest drain was accomplished. At this time we changed the antibiotics to vancomycin and ceftriaxone. A thoracic CT revealed evidence of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient had an uneventful recovery, being discharged after fifteen days of iv antibiotics. Blood cultures were negative and further investigations showed no evidence of other underlying pulmonary disease. Conclusions: Pneumonia is a frequent diagnosis in the ED. This case demonstrates a rare and potentially life-threatening complication if not approached quickly and efficiently. It can happen on healthy children, but further investigation should be considered. Respiratory",

Interventions should target priority geographic areas where the problem is more prevalent. Objective: To estimate the overall prevalence, the prevalence by region and area of residence, of indoor air pollution by cooking fuel in children in Peru; and to study the association of indoor air pollution by cooking fuel with of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children. Methodology: We used data from the 2013-Demographic and Health Survey, with nationwide representativeness. We included children under 5 years of age. Air pollution was present if the child lived in a house that used coal, charcoal, wood, straw, bush, grass, crops or livestock dung as a fuel for cooking. We used logistic regression models to study the independent association of air pollution by cooking fuel and ARI, controlling for potential confounders. Results: We studied 8,616 children; overall prevalence of indoor air pollution was 37.4% (95%CI: 36.4-38.4%). Among those exposed to cooking fuel, in 24.4% (95%CI: 23.5-25.3%) of the houses there were no chimney. The ARI prevalence was 13.0% (95%CI:12.3-13.7%). ARI was associated to indoor air pollution in urban and rural areas, and a dose response pattern was observed (p0.05). By region the association remained but was statistically significant only in the Forest region. Conclusion: Prevalence of indoor air pollution caused by cooking fuel in children was high in Peru and ARI was independently associated to it. Interventions to reduce this source of pollution need to be implemented in Peru, and the Forest should be a priority region for any implementation. Background: Pneumonia is a common infection but it can be the first presentation of an underlying disease, such as tumors. Case Summary Presentation: An 11 year-old boy, with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and asthma, presents to the emergency department with a 2 day history of thoracic pain accompanied with shortness of breath. Physical exam reveals fever and normal oxyhemoglobin saturation (95%-100%) on room air. On auscultation he has absent sounds in the right hemithorax but normal breath sounds on the left. A chest radiograph reveals a round area of consolidative opacity in the right hemithorax and a pleural effusion, confirmed by chest ultrasonography, with 14 mm. Blood tests show a leucocyte count of 16.600/mL with 78.3% of neutrophils, and an elevated C-reactive protein level of 17.59 mg/dL. He is admitted to the hospital and starts intravenous ampicillin. At day 2 after admission, the chest ultrasonography reveals a pleural effusion of 21.6 mm at the right hemithorax and images compatible with an empyema. He is submitted to a Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) and drains about 100 mL of non-pure pleural fluid. The antibiotic therapy is changed to intravenous ceftriaxone. All cultural exams were negative. After 8 days, clinically improved, he is discharged and continues ceftriaxone until completing 14 days. One month later he repeats the chest radiograph which continues to reveal the same round area of opacity. The CT scan and the MRI show a round, encapsulated and cystic mass located in the anterior mediastinum compatible with a teratoma. He was submitted to excision of the tumor and pathologic evaluation revealed a mature teratoma. Subsequently, he is clinically improved and asymptomatic. genotype was determined in 53.8% of the examined children with acute bronchitis, the heterozygous genotype Tyr/His was determined in 42.6%, and the homozygous genotype His/His was determined in 3.7%. The gene polymorphism analysis revealed that children with wheezing syndrome 2.2 times more often had the genotype Tyr/Tyr, in the children of the comparison group (p = 0.023). It has been established that children with a \"weakened\" genotype Tyr/His and His/His disease have more favorable course. Conclusion. The EPOX1 gene may be a candidate for the detection of a predisposition to the development of wheezing in children. The obtained data confirm the facts of the genetic determination of the propensity to character of the course of bronchopulmonary diseases in children. The authors report a 15-year-old Caucasian female, presenting with a oneyear history of bilateral fusiform swelling of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. No other joints were involved, no other clinical symptoms described. The swelling was initially painless, but after two months she started to develop transient episodes of increased swelling of the PIP joints, with limitation of finger mobility, tenderness and pain associated with finger movements, without an identifiable trigger. During these exacerbation episodes, symptomatic therapy using NSAID's had little effect. The past medical history of the patient included a traumatic fracture of the proximal phalanx base of the right hand, three years prior to the initial symptoms. The patient has four siblings, one of which has been described with similar PIP joint swelling, but because our patient is adopted, further details are absent. Blood tests were normal (including markers of acute inflammation C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody); radiography revealed soft-tissue enlargement of the PIP joints, without irregularities of the phalangeal epiphyses. The clinical features and positive family history point to the diagnosis of Thiemann's disease -a rare familial juvenile osteochondrosis of the phalangeal epiphyses, a form of idiopathic avascular necrosis, transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. Diagnostic features include onset before the age of twenty-five and swelling of PIP joints, with normal laboratory tests; radiographs aid diagnosis if typical changes are present. Role of trauma is undetermined. Clinicians should be aware of this rare disorder which might be evocative of other forms of arthritis, not only for greater clinical recognition but also avoidance of unnecessary treatments -this disease has a benign course, most patients are asymptomatic after growth-plate closure.",

The positive TST was more common in TB contacts than in 7-year-old children (\u03c7 2 = 6220.5; p 0.001). The detection of positive TST is more often in contacts than in group of 7year-old children (risk ratio -3.71; 95 perc. CI 3.59, 3.83). Positive TST was detected in 9593 (7.7 perc.) of 7-year-old children and 4029 (28.7 perc.) of TB contact children. The same trend was observed when calculating positive TST of children from social risk families. It was found more often positive TST in social risk group children (\u03c7 2 = 484.2; p 0.001; risk ratio -1.67; 95 perc. CI1.60, 1.75), if compare with the group of 7-year-old children.Conclusions: The obligatory national TST screening for tuberculosis infection in the group of 7-year-old children is not cost effective and clinically relevant.

They are commonly caused by gram negative bacteria. In urinary infections nonspecific symptoms occur such as: vomiting, fever and anxiety. After the third year of life as more frequent are the abdominal pain, frequent and painful micturition and difficulties when urinating. Every vague febrile condition should be considered as a possible urinary infection. Goal: With timely diagnosis and treatment of urinary infections impairment of the renal (kidney) function is prevented. Materials and methods: Data from 590 children aged 0 to 18 years suspected of urinary infection or febrile for a period of 3 years (2017-2019) had been processed. Analytical and descriptive method had been used for processing. Results: Out of 290 children with taken urine -culture, 105 showed positive results (36,20%",

A minority (6.5%) believe that the practice of physical exercise is contraindicated in asthmatics. As for treatment, 87.0% know that includes medication control and crisis and 33.0% believes that inhaled therapy is responsible for gaining weight. In the opinion of 80.4% of individuals preventive measures may be implemented in schools which aim to prevent exacerbations in asthmatics. Conclusion: Despite the therapeutic evolution, the asthma control is a challenge and this pathology is a frequent cause of hospitalization. The results express many doubts and myths about asthma so the focus on training is essential, taking into account the time spent by the child/adolescent in school. The training allows you to establish preventive measures and act correctly in case of crisis, promoting a better quality of life for asthmatics.

Super antigen (SAg) is suspected to be responsible of Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome (KDSS) which is an aggressive complication of Kawasaki Disease (KD). We hypothesize that KDSS is associated with the activation of TCRV\u03b22 and TCRV\u03b28 lymphocytes through the presence of SAg from bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Objective. To compare the expression of TCRV\u03b22 and V\u03b28 receptor variants in lymphocytes of the KDSS and KD groups. Methods. A case-control study was performed in patients admitted in the National Institute of Pediatrics between January 2018 and July 2019. Case group (n=8), patients with KDSS; control group (n=56), patients with KD without shock. The percentage (%) of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing TCRV\u03b22 and TCRV\u03b28 as well the activated lymphocytes CD25+ were determined in blood samples by flow cytofluorometry. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was used to compare both groups.Results. The expression of variants CD3+CD4+TCRV\u03b22+ and CD3+ CD8+TCRV\u03b28+CD25+ was significantly higher in the KDSS group, in comparison to non-shock KD group with a median [Q1, Q3]: 27.Conclusion. These preliminary data suggests that a SAg is triggering the excessive response observed in patients with KDSS.

Acute appendicitis (AA) is the main etiology of surgical abdominal pain in children. Objectives: Our aim is to describe and analyze the clinical characteristics of our patients who have undergone surgery on suspicion of AA. Secondly, to describe AA evolution according to some prognosis factors. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive and analytical study through review of electronic clinical records. Patients from 0 to 14 years old who have undergone surgery for suspicion of AA, are included. Study period: 8 months. Setting: tertiary hospital. Results: Sample size = 96. Median age = 10`8 years. Male sex: 64.6%. The most frequent symptoms in our study are: pain in low right quadrant (79.2%), nausea/vomiting (72.9%), fever (32.3%) and hyporexia (22.9%). Preferred diagnostic method is ultrasound (performed in 91.6%). Most common intraoperative findings are: phlegmonous AA (37.5%), gangrenous AA (40.6%), plastron (10.4%). 37.5% appendices are retrocecal. We have analyzed the incidence of complications (days of total admission, admission to pediatric intensive care, need for a central catheter or parenteral nutrition, need of surgical reintervention) in children under 4 years of age, in gangrenous AA, in those with ultrasonography data suggesting complicated AA, and those with increased CRP. Conclusions: Acute appendicitis is the main surgical diagnosis of abdominal pain in pediatric age. According to literature, some factors are known to be related to worse prognosis, such as: age under 4 years old, gangrenous or perforate AA and CRP increase. However, we have not found a statistically significant association in this respect.The Role of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support in Malignant Infantile Pertussis Francisca Calheiros-Trigo 1 , Lurdes Lisboa 2 , Marta Jo\u00e3o Silva 2 , Roberto Roncon-Albuquerque Jr 3 , Augusto Ribeiro 2 Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de Braga, Portugal Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio de S.

CXRs (Chest Xrays) are used either to support clinical decision making and result in therapeutic changes or are used to confirm adequacy of current interventions and remain unchanged. This is a retrospective study aimed at evaluating the number of CXRs our patients receive and how the management of patients is influenced by such CXR. Methods: All patients admitted during Oct-Nov 2017 on Paediatric Critical Care Unit at Royal London Hospital who have undergone at least one CXR per admission in the PCCU. Patients who have received only other XRayssuch as abdominal, neck, pelvis, etc. will not be included in the study.

Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of ADHD patients followed in a level two Pediatric Center. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with ADHD followed in a level two Pediatric Center during a 2.5 year period. Results: 2007 children attended the Neurodevelopment Consultation in the study period and 516 (25.7%) met ADHD diagnostic criteria. 71% were male. Median age at first consultation was 7 years. 48% were sent by their Primary Care Physician and learning disabilities and hyperactivity/ inattention were the main causes for referral. The most frequent associated comorbid disorders were specific learning disorders and intellectual developmental disorder. 52% of patients required specific school adequacies. At the last appointment, 68% of patients were under treatment with methylphenidate and 2% with atomoxetine, with good outcomes. Conclusion: ADHD was the most frequent diagnosis among pediatric patients attending our Neurodevelopment Consultation, with a significant male predominance, often as a comorbid diagnosis.

However, the predictive factors for RFS are unknown. Objective: To determine the possibility of predicting RFS based on the clinical data at the emergency department. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective study in Atsugi City Hospital in Japan, conducted betweenDecember 1, 2018 and February  28, 2019. FS are defined as the seizures accompanied by body temperature \u2265 38.0\u00b0C without central nervous system infection, occurring in children between 6-60 months of age. Exclusion criteria were multiple seizures before visiting the emergency department, diazepam administration before visiting the emergency department or when going home, seizures lasting 15 minutes, underlying diseases (i.e. epilepsy, gastroenteritis, etc.), and no laboratory test at the emergency department. The primary outcome was RFS. Results: Fifty-one patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The incidence of RFS was 17.6% (9/51) and all except one patient reported the recurrence of a seizure within 24 hours from the first seizure. The group with RFS showed significant prevalence in males (P=0.043) and a comparatively lower body temperature (P=0.013). After adjustment for possible confounding factors, RFS showed significant associations with males (odds ratio, 18.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-278.81; P=0.04) and body temperature (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.75; P=0.02). In this cohort, body temperature cut-off value \u2264 39.4\u00b0C and males showed specificity and negative predictive values of 78.6% and 86.8%, respectively. Conclusion: The incidence of RFS was 17.6%. In this study, RFS was strongly related to a body temperature \u2264 39.4\u00b0C and a prevalence in males. In future, a prospective and large-sized sample study will be needed to determine the predictive factors for RFS.Institute of Child Development, Dana Children's Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, Israel Pediatric Neurology Unit,, Dana Children's Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, IsraelObjective: ADHD & Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have recently been discussed as sharing etiology and symptomatolgy, to such an extent that 60% of children with ASD show symptoms of ADHD, and some 30% of ADHD children have difficulties in social communication. The overlap or similarity of these two neurodevelopment disorders requires further studies, to understand their common denominator. Method: We examined the performance of 25 ASD children (no ADHD) (6years) and 25 ADHD (no ASD) children matched for age, gender and socioeconomic status on a computerized performance test (MOXO-CPT which incorporates visual and auditory stimuli serving as environmental distracters), commonly used as one of the tools in the clinical diagnosis of ADHD. Results: We found that children with ASD performed better (borderline significance) on 3\\4 test items (Attention, Timing, Hyperactivity), while Impulsivity was the same in both groups. Both groups were affected by visual and auditory distracters built-in the MOXO paradigm, but ASD children were significantly less distracted, and showed better performance consistency over time than the ADHD group. Conclusion: On our computerized test battery MOXO, children with ASD showed better performance than ADHD children on most test items, challenging previous studies on this issue. Computerized Performance Test might provide a \"protected\" environment for ASD children that does not unravel their attention difficulties under naturalistic conditions.Worn-out Tip Shoes as a Clue for a Family Genetic Diagnosis Sara Mosca 1 , Jos\u00e9 Fontoura Matias 2 , Diana Alba 3 , Mafalda Moreira 3 , Leonilde Machado 3 , Teresa Temudo 4 , Joana Martins 4 1 Pediatric Department, Centro Materno-Infantil do Norte, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio do Porto, Portugal 2 Pediatric Department, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Portugal Pediatric Department, Centro Hospitalar T\u00e2mega e Sousa, Penafiel, Portugal, Portugal Neuropediatrics Unit, Pediatric Department, Centro Materno-Infantil do Norte, Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio do Porto, Portugal",

            "text": "Genotype-phenotype Association In A Boy With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Sara Teixeira 1 , Helena Santos 1 , Marta Vila Real 1 , F\u00e1tima Santos 1 Unit of Neurosciences of Childhood and Adolescence, Pediatric Service, Centro Hospitalar Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho, Portugal Introduction: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), is the most common form of Neurofibromatosis. Clinical characteristics include: caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, inguinal and axillary ephelides, multiple neurofibromas and Lisch nodules. Is an autosomal dominant disorder, with extreme clinical variability. The gene complexity and the diversity of mutations in NF1 gene make the genotype-phenotype correlations very difficult.Case Presentation: We describe a case of a 9-years-old boy, first child of a healthy and unrelated couple, who had dismorphic facial features, multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, and delayed psychomotor development since first year of life. At eight months of age, neurofibroma was detected, and molecular study was requested confirming the presence of mutation in the NF1 gene. During follow-up, there was an increase in the number of cutaneous neurofibromas and development of numerous neurofibromas in nerve pathways, including intercostal, pelvic nerve plexus, thigh roots, as well as plexiform neurofibroma affecting the upper limb. He also presented intellectual impairment and Lisch nodule in the left eye. Cerebral magnetic resonance showed small hamartomas in the pale globes, thalamus, peri-aquedutal region, splenius of the corpus callosum on the right side and at the ipsilateral deep slope of the cerebellar hemisphere and protuberance, with no mass effect. The abdominal study revealed the presence of a retroperitoneal mass, measuring 95x68 mm, involving the large visceral vessels, but without occluding them and exerting mass effect on the adjacent structures. This mass still`s under study. Array-CGH analysis revealed microdeletion of 1.29 Mb in the long arm of chromosome 17 (band 17q11.2). Conclusion: Although many different mutations associated with neurofibromatosis, have been described, information about genotype-phenotype correlations are still limited. Authors pretend to emphasize the association of deletions involving NF1 gene and a more severe phenotype, as can be seen in our patient.Extensive Cerebral Venous Thrombosis as a Manifestation of anUncommon Disease Mariana Portela 1 , Ana Lu\u00edsa Carvalho 1 , Andreia Lopes 2 , Teresa Pontes 1 , Ana Paula Barbosa 4 , Carla Ferreira 3 , Arnaldo Cerqueira 3 , Ricardo Mar\u00e9 5 , \u00c2ngela Oliveira 3 Paediatrics, Hospital de Braga, Portugal Paediatrics, Hospital Senhora da Oliveira, Portugal Paediatric Intermediate Care Unit, Hospital de Braga, Portugal Immunotherapy, Hospital de Braga, Portugal Neurology, Hospital de Braga, PortugalBackground: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has a wide range of manifestations and could be challenging to diagnose. Headache is the first and most frequent sign. Intracranial hypertension, encephalopathy, focal neurologic alterations or seizures could be associated. Thus, in presentations concerning CVT, urgent neuroimaging is necessary. Objective and Methods: A 15 years old female, previously healthy, started a 5 day course of headache and vomiting, associated with left otitis media three days after the onset. Firstly observed in her hospital nearby, she started analgesia and antibiotics. Due the lack of improvement two days later, decreased muscle strength and paresthesias in the left upper limb, as well as left hypovision she resorted again. Normal neurological exam was described, except nuchal rigidity. No fever. A Computed Tomography angiography was performed, showing sagittal, recto and tranverse sinus thrombosis and cerebral edema. She was then transferred to our hospital and admitted in pediatric intermediate care unit. She started intravenous heparin, which was changed to warfarin and enoxaparin at the 13th day. In the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), extensive venous thrombosis was observed, with findings suggesting acute leukoencephalopathy and optic nerve compromise. Bilateral papilledema was observed. She initiated acetazolamide. The clinical outcome was good, with resolution of the complaints. MRI was repeated 15 days later, with some reduction in the venous congestion. The prothrombotic tests were negative, except elevated levels of homocysteine in urine suggesting classic homocystinuria, which was then confirmed with the mutation in CBS gene. She was discharged, keeping a close multidisciplinary follow up.Conclusion: Classic homocystinuria is an autossomic recessive disease, related to the metionine metabolism and associated with prothrombotic events, so this patients must be monitored at regular intervals. Further investigations should be made in order to make a correlation with the abnormal extensive alterations in white matter and homocystinuria1062 NeurologyDetermining the Quality of Life of Children Living with Epilepsy in Kenya: a Cross-Sectional Study Using the CHEQOL-25 Tool Syeda Ra'ana Hussain 1 , James Orwa 1 , Caroline Mbuba Kathomi 1 , Dilraj Sokhi 1 , Osman Miyanji 1,2 , Hussein Dossajee 3 , Pauline Samia 1 Background: Children with epilepsy (CWE) in low/lower-middle income countries are likely to experience lower health-related quality of life (HrQoL) due to poverty and stigma, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Few studies have measured this reliably, as most tools capture caregiver rather than child responses; the CHEQOL-25 tool, however, collects both child and caregiver perspectives across five domains: 'interpersonal/social', 'present concerns', 'intrapersonal/emotional', 'secrecy', and 'normality'. Objective: To measure HrQoL in CWE using CHEQOL-25 at paediatric outpatient settings in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study, enrolling CWE aged 7-15 years and their caregivers. Good HrQoL was defined as CHEQOL-25 score 60 and 50 for CWE and caregiver respectively. CWE-caregiver corroboration was assessed using Kappa statistic; multivariate linear regression analysis elucidated factors affecting HrQoL.Results: We surveyed 177 CWE-caregiver couples [CWE median age 11 years (range 8-13); 53.1% (94/177) male]. The commonest seizure type [66.7% (118/177)] was tonic-clonic [median onset age 5(2-8) years; 41.8% (74/177) on one anti-epileptic]. 75.3% (133/177) of CWE visited clinic more than twice in the preceding six months due to uncontrolled seizures. 60.5% (107/177) of CWE and 56.5% (100/177) of caregivers reported good HrQoL (CHEQOL-25 scores 60.6/100 and 60.4/100 respectively), with significant CWE-caregiver response corroboration in the 'interpersonal/social' and 'intrapersonal/emotional' domains (p0.005). Good HrQoL was significantly less likely for CWE with: (i) male caregivers [odds ratio (OR)=0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.81; p=0.001]; and (ii) caregivers with less than full primary education [OR=0.41(0.17-0.980; p=0.04]. 55.3% (98/177) of CWE had a closeknit (n\u22644 members) circle of friends, with increasing friend numbers being positively associated with good HrQoL [OR=1.09(1.01-1.17)].Conclusion: HrQoL was good in the majority of our cohortas reported by both CWE and their caregiversespecially if the child had a bigger friends circle, but HrQoL was not good if the caregiver was male or uneducated.Pediatric department, Hospital Dr N\u00e9lio Mendon\u00e7a, PortugalIntroduction: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is the most frequent glomerular disease of childhood, reaching about 2-7: 100,000 children. This may be associated with thromboembolic complications, mostly with venous origin. The diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis is difficult, since the clinic may be non-specific. In the acute phase recommended treatment is low molecular weight heparin for 5 to 7 days. Case report: A 3-year-old female child, previously healthy presented to the pediatric emergency department with two days of irritability, prostration and periorbital edema. Physical examination showed peri-orbital edema and blood preassure was normal. Laboratory workup revealed nephrotic proteinuria, megaloblastic anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and hypoalbuminemia (15.3 mg / dL), and elevated sedimentation rate. Under the diagnosis of Nephrotic Syndrome, she was admitted on steroid therapy. Remission occurred on the 8th day of therapy, being discharged on the 12th under steroid therapy with Pediatric Nephrology follow-up. Five days after discharge she started headache with photophobia, nocturnal awakening and morning vomiting. On general observation she was complaining, slightly dehydrated, normotensive, with normal cardiopulmonary evaluation. Neurologic examination was normal without fundoscopic alterations. Due to this the clinical manifestations and concomitant risk factors angiotomography was performed, showing an extensive venous thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus with an apparent extension to the transverse sinus and started antithrombotic therapy. Progressive improvement of headache episodes was observed, being asymptomatic after 3 days of antithrombotic therapy (Enoxaparine). She remained clinically stable throughout the hospitalization period and was discharged on the 15th day taking prednisolone, enoxaparin and enalapril, with pediatric nephrology and neuropediatrics follow-up. Hereditary thrombophilia and dysfibrinogenemias were studied. She remains clinically well without neurologic symptons. Conclusion: Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare yet a important complication of NS. The hypercoagulant state contributes to this phenomenon due to its multifactorial etiology. The high clinical suspicion with contrast-enhanced CT allowed the early institution of therapy, thus preventing the occurrence of post-thrombotic complications. In the absence of major intracranial hemorrhage anticoagulation is the gold standard of treatment. There is no consensus for prophylactic treatment.Vomit as an Alert in a Rare Pathology Mariana Santos 1 , Ricardo Mar\u00e9 2 , Maria Jo\u00e3o Nogueira 1 , Margarida Reis Morais 1 , Susana Carvalho 1 , S\u00f3nia Figueiroa 3 , Teresa Pontes 1 Paediatric Neurology, Centro Materno Infantil do Norte, PortugalBackground: Vomits are a frequent symptom in paediatric ages and can be related to severe diseases, like neuromyelitis optica (NMO), characterized by imuno-mediated demyelination and axonal destruction, involving particularly the optic nerve and spinal cord. Anti-aquaporin antibodies (AbAQ4) are involved in the pathogenesis and distinguishes it from multiple sclerosis. Case Description: Ten year-old boy with irrelevant medical history, with 10 days of recurrent vomiting, food refusal and belching, not responsive to symptomatic treatment. The blood tests and abdominal ultrasound were normal. The upper digestive endoscopy revealed esophagitis, and he started domperidone and pantoprazole, with slight improvement. Seven days after admission he started feeling less active, with frontal headache. The brain MRI showed a lesion at the posterior side of rachidian bulb (postrema area), probably with an inflammatory origin. The CSF revealed pleocytosis (8 cells) with negative virologic, microbiologic and oligoclonal bands. The immunologic study was normal. Vomiting ceased after 5 days of methylprednisolone. Once he stopped the treatment, the vomiting and headache re-emerged, associated with somnolence, dysarthria, blurred vision, vertical nystagmus, unbalance and right hypoesthesia. He restarted corthycoterapy at growing doses. The neuroaxis MRI revealed a new lesion at C3, of inflammatory nature and anti-MOG and AbAQ4 were requested. The patient was transferred to a clinic center with Neuropediatrics, where he initiated plasmapheresis and a course of IV immunoglobulins after the positive result of AbAQ4, with significant improvement. He was readmitted one month later with relapse suspicion, medicated with rituximab. Currently he is under corthycoterapy, asymptomatic and with negative AbAQ4. Conclusion: The postrema area syndrome is relativity common within NMO and precedes the involvement of the optic nerve or spinal cord, which can be considered an important warning sign. Early recognition and treatment can prevent the occurrence of outbreaks of optic nevritis or transverse myelitis.Pediatric, PHI Clinical hospital, MacedoniaBackground: Simple febrile seizures (SFS) are generalized tonic clonic seizures, with a duration less than 15 minutes, no recurrence within the next 24 hours, no underlying neurological illness, no focal features during or after and presented during fever in children between 6 months and 5 years of age. Sodium, has a well established role in the function of the neurons, by being a part of the sodium potassium ATPase complex and transitions trough voltage gated channels. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world.Available data suggest significant association between SFS and IDA. Objective: 78 hospitalized children with SFS in a 3 year period (2016-2018) were included. Sodium blood levels were measured in the first hour after the seizure and hemoglobin and iron values were evaluated after appropriate hydration. Methods: Sodium and iron blood levels were measured with the assay method of Architect 4000 device and hemoglobin values with the Humacount device. Reference ranges :sodium 136-145 mmol/L, iron 10-30 \u03bcmol/L, Hemoglobin 95-150 g/L ( ranges by age considered) Results: Sodium levels & 49 children (62,8%) lower than 136 mmo/L. & 20 children(25,6%) higher than 136 mmol/L.",

These children encounter different forms of exclusion and are affected by them to varying degrees. Local data on these children are not available and therefore we undertook this descriptive study with the following objectives. Objectives: To identify children with disabilities in a rural area, categorise the disability according to the type and to assess the current services they received. Design, setting and method: A cross sectional study was undertaken in the area of Rikillagaskada. The Public Health Midwives were given a basic training to detect such children in the community and invited them to a special clinic conducted at the hospital. All children underwent a physical examination including a neurological assessment to arrive at a diagnosis by a medical officer. Data were collected on pre tested questionnaires. Results: Fifty five (n=55) (M:F=28:27) children were identified. Their age ranged from 10 months-12 years. Their disabilities were categorized as: physical (60%), sensory (visual and hearing) (12%), intellectual (20%), and mixed (7%). 49% were confirmed to have cerebral palsy on neurological examination. A cause for the disability could be identified in 72%. Only 31% were attending rehabilitation. None of the children with Down Syndrome received follow up. 64% of 6-12 years children received education. Majority (69%) of children did not attend rehabilitation due to the distance to travel. 96% of families did not receive any funds (53/55). Conclusions: 50% disabilities were due to Cerebral Palsy. A significant proportion of children were not getting followed up mainly due to the lack of local rehabilitation facilities. Community support and provision of funds for the families were negligible.Cases of Neurological Impairment in PICUElpis Chochliourou 1 , Eleni Volakli 1 , Asimina Violaki 1 , Peristera-Elena Matzafleri 1 , Menelaos Svirkos 1 , Anastasia Anastasiou 1 , Maria Sdougka 1 1 Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Hippokration General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece Background: Cases with neurological impairment, due to a variety of pathology seem to be frequent symptomatology of patients in a PICU. The above incidences were studied in a period of 3 years, while sex, age, clinical status in entrance, total stay in PICU and final outcome were retrospectively reviewed. Objectives: The properties of the pathology determine the extent of the damage with sometimes mild symptoms and sometimes a rapid development that may end up in death. Hospital stay maybe long. Methods: 56 cases were described with affected neurological image. 16 cases in 2016, 15 cases in 2017 and 25 cases in 2018. The neurological image varied with coma, convulsions, status epilepticus, or symptoms due to encephalitis or meningitis. 1 incident with known Dravet syndrome, 1 with metabolic edema and 1 case with surgical hematoma. Results: The incidences concerned status epilepticus were 18had brain death (2/3 boys). Mean average of hospital stay14,4 days. The ages of the hospitalized children variety from 42 days to 13 years old.Conclusions: A lot of incidences need the helpful treatment of PICUmechanical or non mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic stabilization, combination of anticonvulsant drugs, antibiotic therapy-while a percentage of these are very serious with a long hospital stay.

Metabolic syndrome (Mets) is a group of risk factors which include abdominal obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance and hypertension. Mets is diagnosed from the age of 10 years old according to IDF criteria if there are three and more criteria listed above are present. The high waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) (\u22650.5) is associated with the increased risk of Mets. Leptin, like other neuropeptides, is a possible link between obesity and the development of hypertension. Objective: The aim of this work is to compare the leptin resistance in children with Mets associated with hypertension and without one. Methods. A cross-sectional study was accomplished in a group of 78 children (10-17 years old) with Mets. Patients were classified into main group (38 patients with Mets and hypertension) and comparison group (40 children with Mets without hypertension). In addition to the criteria for metabolic syndrome for the patients the waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), serum leptin level were determined and leptin resistance was calculated. The statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 22.0. Results: According to the results of the examination at the main group average values of serum leptin level were significantly higher (p 0.05) than in the comparison group (29.9\u00b10.74 and 20.0\u00b10.52). Leptin resistance were determined in 57.9% of patients with arterial hypertension and only 25% in the group without it (p 0.05). There was a positive correlation between leptin and WtHR\u22650.5 r= 0.575. Conclusion. Leptin resistance and WtHR\u22650.5 are associated with the increase of cardiovascular risks of Mets in children.Nutritional Profile of Children of Public Schools of Southern BrazilJane Cardoso 1 , Mayara Maria De Jesus Rozante 1Medicine, Center of University of Maringa, BrazilObjective: Describe the nutritional and epidemiologic profile of children in public schools in an urban area in Southern Brazil.

Evaluation of the roles of universities in practicing physical exercise. Material and Methods: Observational analytical study, using data collected by means of a questionnaire on physical exercise. 818 students participated -428 from Yasar University in Ismir, Turkey, and 390 from University of Coimbra, Portugal. The data were collected during the 1 st Semester of the 2018/2019 academic year. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 22 (p0.5). Results: 818 students were included -428 from Yasar University in Ismir, Turkey (162 males and 266 females) and 390 from University of Coimbra, Portugal (136 males and 254 females). The average age of the students was 21-22 years old. Half of the students practiced physical exercise (Yasar 46.3% / Coimbra 50%). Half practiced physical exercise less than 3 times a year (Yasar 47.6% and 52% in Coimbra). Most of the students had practiced physical exercise prior to going to university. The university was considered a decisive factor for the practice of physical exercise by 56.7% at Coimbra vs. 39.7% at Izmir (p0.001). A minority recognised the role of the universities in practicing physical exercise -2.1% at Coimbra and 0.9% at Izmir. Only 3.1% of the Coimbra students who practice physical exercise do so at the university, in comparison to 28.5% of the students at Izmir (p0.001). The reasons cited were: lack of knowledge by 23.9% of the Coimbra students and 7.8% of the students at Yasar (p0.001) and lack of time by 54.8% of the students at Yasar and 46.9% of the Coimbra students (p0.001). Most of the students who practice physical activity have a normal BMI.Conclusions/ DiscussionHalf of the students practice physical exercise. The role of physical activity for having a healthy life is recognised by students. Most university students have an adequate body mass index. The majority of the students who practice physical exercise do so out of the university. Students at Yasar recognise the positive role of the university for practicing exercise. Universities will have to reflect and take measures to encourage physical activity.The Role of Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet to Lymphocyte Ration in Children's Obesity Cristina Oana M\u0103rginean 1 , Lorena Elena Meli\u021b 1 , Dana Valentina Ghica 2 , Claudiu M\u0103rginean 3 , Maria Oana M\u0103rginean 4 Pediatrics, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology, Romania 2 Medical Informatics and Biostatistics, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology, Romania Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology, Romania Pediatric Cardiology, University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology, Romania",

Research in the past two decades has focused on determining correlations between obesity and sleeping disorders. Many authors suggest that sleep duration and multiple aspects of sleep patterns, including sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD), are in close association with weight problems in children of all ages. Objective: The authors aimed to evaluate how overweight/obese children sleep. Methods: We conducted a prospective study from November 2018 until January 2019 that included overweight (BMI 85 th -95 th percentile) or obese (BMI \u226595 th percentile) 3-18 years old children. The patients were enrolled in the Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Children's Hospital, where they were admitted for unrelated pathology. Parents were asked to fill in a SRBD scale. The obese/overweight children were scored on this scale; scores\u22650.33 were considered positive and suggestive of high risk for pediatric sleep-related breathing disorder. The length of the children's sleep during the day and overnight were also recorded. Results: Forty five patients were enrolled (53.3% obese). Mean age was 11 years 4 months, sex ratio M/F=1.25/1, 62.2% came from urban areas. The parents declared an average 8.3 hours of night sleep. 60% of the children did not take naps during the day. 6.66% of parents declared their children to have difficulty breathing during sleep, 15.5% perceived periods of apnea during their child's sleep and 26.6% felt the child was tired in the morning. A significant proportion of patients (26.6%) were scored positive for SRBD, percentages being slightly higher for obese vs overweight children (29 vs.23.8%).Conclusions: A quarter of the obese/overweight children evaluated were at high risk of sleep related breathing disorder. Addressing obesity from a young age should be expected to improve the quality of life on many levels, including sleep quality and consequently daytime activity.What Children Eat and what Parents Say or Think they Eat Teresa Pinheiro 1 , Teresa Caldeira 1 1 Neonatology/Pediatric Department, Centro Hospitalar de Entre-o-Douro e Vouga, PortugalChild obesity is a public health problem. Children learn about nutrition at school and parents are constantly reminded of the importance of healthy eating but doubt remains whether they are aware of what their children eat, as they spend most of their days at school, some of them with pocket money to spend on food. Our goal was to compare what children say about their meals and what parents know about it. We applied a food survey to children in three schools in the region of Porto and asked their parents to answer the same inquiry. It involved questions about frequency of meals, consumption of various foods and use of the cafeteria. The results were analyzed using SPSS Statistics\u00ae. The survey was applied to 201 children, mean age of 8,4 years (min 6, max 12, SD+-1,5) and 53% male. 48% reported having 5 meals/day. 42% reported eating 3 or more fruits/day. 80% reported eating meat 3 or more times/week and 52% reported the same frequency of fish. 50% consumed dairy 3 or more times/week. 14% reported drinking soft drinks and 12% eating candy every day. The parents' survey reported a 4% and 5% consumption of soft drinks and candy every day, but the results were not statistically different between groups. 71% of the children reported using the cafeteria, 41% to buy candy, 66% bread and pastry and 19% soft drinks. Food surveys may not be the best test to evaluate food consumption. Children' memory may not be accurate and parents' answers may be biased by what they know is healthy. Our sample shows high frequency of soft drinks and candy consumption, that was not reported by the parents, although with no statistical significance. These results and the low frequency of fish consumption demonstrates the need for more educational programs regarding healthy nutrition, aimed at children and their parents. Also, schools should be aware and accountable for foods they have available.Emotional Feeding Model (EFM) in Early Childhood to Prevent Obesity, Eating Disorders, Child Neglect and Abuse Shlomith Samish 1 , Pnina Hertz 2 , Nurit Samish 3 School of Nutritional Scinces, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel Feeding Clinic, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel 3 Education, Educational Psychology Services, Israel",

The scoring was compared for CMC & an equal number of non-CMC pediatric patients admitted during the same study period using Excel Statistical program. For CMC patients, the complexity index scores are 2.5-2.6 times higher & LOS also increases by 2.1. Twenty percent of patients of admitted are of high complexity. Validated risk stratification tools applied to CMC patients demonstrate increased LOS & RR that are more than twice that of the non-CMC patients. A highrisk index can lead to inefficient health care utilization, unaccountable patient/family cost, & poor outcomes.

            "text": "Background: Post-Infectious Glomerulonephritis (PIG) is the most common cause of acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) in children and manifests clinically as nephritic syndrome. Pneumonia is rarely associated with the occurrence of AGN. PIG prognosis is usually benign, with complete recovery occurring in most cases. Hypocomplementemia is associated with a more severe disease course, namely, azotaemia and nephritic syndrome. Proteinuria persistency, even residual, might be a long-term predictive factor for chronic kidney disease. Case Report: Four-year-old previously healthy girl with national immunization program up to date, was admitted to our paediatrics unit with right-lobe pneumonia complicated with acute renal injury. The urinalysis revealed haematuria (5-10 erit/uL), proteinuria (protein/creatine ratio 2,4 mg/mg) and leukocyturia. There was no acid-base imbalance. C3 levels were low (11,3 mg/dL, range 81-167), with normal C4 levels. After 24h of standard antibiotic therapy, hypertension, generalized oedema, oliguria and inspiratory bibasal crackles appeared. IV furosemide was initiated, with progressive clinical and analytical improvement, blood pressure and diuresis normalized in 48 hours. Five weeks after discharge, under no medication, she was asymptomatic and normotensive, without other abnormalities on physical examination. Renal function and inflammatory parameters were normal, and C3 levels improved (58,8 mg/dL, range 81-167 mg/dL). Microscopic haematuria and mild proteinuria (protein/creatinine ratio 0,33 mg/mg) were still present. Six months after this episode, there was no haematuria, C3 levels and the protein/creatinine ratio were normalised, but microalbuminuria, though residual, persisted (22,7 mg/g creatinine). One year after the acute episode, microalbuminuria returned to the normal range (10 mg/g creatinine).Conclusions: With this case presentation, the authors highlight the concomitant renal impairment associated with respiratory infection, namely pneumococcal pneumonia, an increasingly diagnosed form of infectious glomerulonephritis. It is important to reinforce the significance of followup to identify possible complications and prevent functional deterioration, even when the PIG has an overall favourable prognosis. Introduction: Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MDK) is a rare congenital anomaly of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). The disease is characterized with multiple non-communicating cysts without functional renal parenchyma; nowadays the diagnosis is established with prenatal ultrasound screening of the kidneys and urinary tract. The aim of this work is the presentation of rare association of multicystic dysplastic kidney with posterior urethral valves. Case report: A healthy male newborn baby was referred for nephrourological work up due to prenatal diagnosis of multicystic kidney which resolved completely before delivery. The first postnatal ultrasound scan revealed normal morphology of the right kidney and the bladder. At the age of two months the parents complained that the baby had poor urinary stream. Voiding urethrocystography revealed posterior urethral valves and the baby underwent successful valve resection. Discussion and conclusion: We present a rare association of multicystic dysplastic kidney with posterior urethral valves. This association is very rare and was described in few reports. In the series of Mathiot et al. (J Radiol. 2002) among 54 neonates with diagnosed MDK three had posterior urethral valves. Pooled data from 67 studies including 2159 patients in whom VCUG was performed showed association with posterior urethral valves only in 9 cases (0.42%) (Schreuder MF et al, Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2009 ). Clinician should suspect urethral valves in infants with poor stream even in the case of normal kidney/bladder ultrasound. Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the clinical features, biochemical parameters, genetic findings and outcome in Macedonian children with primary hyperroxaluria. Methods: PH was defined if the urinary oxalate levels were 1.0 mmol/1.73m 2 /d. Secondary causes were excluded on the basis of dietary history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Urinary excretion of glycolate and glycerate was determined within the same samples. 24-hour urine samples were collected for testing pyridoxine sensitivity while in anuric patients plasma oxalate concentration were measured before and after pyridoxine challenge. Mutational analysis of the respective PH1/2/3 genes was performed. Results: In the period 1995-2018 there were 10 patients with PH (In 6 confirmed with mutational analysis of the AGXT gene). There were no patients with PH2/3. The youngest patient at diagnosis was 4 months old and the oldest 18 years. Four patients progressed to ESKD and one died. Three patients were sensitive to pyridoxine. One patient had nephrolithiasis which was initially considered as a consequence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, but metabolic investigation revealed hyperoxaluria, hyperlglycolaturia and normalization of urinary oxalate excretion under pyridoxine treatment. Conclusions: Macedonian PH children were diagnosed late in the course of the disease when progressive kidney damage ensued. There were no cases of PH2 and PH3. It seems that yet unidentified genes are responsible for PH in Macedonian children. One should implement mandatory urinary oxalate screening in all children with urolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis in order to initiate early and aggressive conservative management to prevent systemic oxalosis. Background: A great diagnostic value in the genesis of hematuria in children with nephropathy is the change in cell membranes of the Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by episodes of demyelination in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Pediatric MS is increasingly recognized, mostly in females, usually presenting as an isolated syndrome (eg. optic neuritis). Diagnosis usually involves Brain Magnetic Ressonance (MRI), Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and McDonald criteria for dissemination in space and time. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is used in acute attacks. Relapsingremitting MS (RRMS) is the initial form in 97-99% and the recommended treatment is disease-modifying therapy (injectable or oral). Objective: Describe a MS case in pediatric age, emphasizing the need for greater awareness of this entity. Case Report/Results: A 12 year-old girl, previously healthy, complains of sudden onset of paresthesias, right upper limb paresis with inability to write. Symptoms started 5 days before, after her dog death. Examination showed altered fine mobility, right dysmetria and asymmetric gait. Normal Computed Tomography. MRI revealed several areas of hyperintensity in T2-sequences, the major on left pons, suggesting active MS lesions. She was admitted to a Neuropediatric Department and received a methylprednisolone pulse. CSF showed oligoclonal bands and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM. Two months later, Interferon beta-1a was initiated. Meanwhile, she had another relapse with headache, dysarthria, right paretic gait and limb paresthesias correlating with two Background: Seizures are a common manifestation of several childhood pathologies, often requiring hospitalization due to associated morbidity and mortality. Objective: Characterize the population admitted in a pediatric hospital service with seizures, detailed by age groups. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all admissions from January 1st 2011 to December 31st 2018. Inclusion criteria: seizures as motive of hospital admission and age between 0 and 17 years and 365 days; children with seizures occurring only after hospitalization were excluded. The studied variables were clinical presentation, etiology, gender, age, comorbidities, origin and destination after discharge. Results: A total of 146 patients were admitted for seizures, with predominance in male gender (61,4%) and in children under 4 years old (53,4%). It was the first episode in 46,6%, of which 26,5% had comorbidities. Presence of fever was commoner among 1-4 years old (48,3%). Generalized tonicclonic were the most common type of crisis in every age group (41,1%); 7,5% presented in status epilepticus. The most common causes were epilepsy (33,6%) (prevailing in those older than 4 years old); complex febrile seizures (20,6%) (uppermost in those under 4 years old) and structural brain injury associated epilepsy (11,6%). Only 5 (3,4%) were due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS). There was 1 death (0,7%). There were abnormalities in 65,7% of the children who performed EEG (73,9%) and in 55.2% of those who underwent neuroimaging (19,9%). Conclusion: The causes of seizures requiring hospitalization varies by age: complex febrile seizures in younger and epilepsy in older children. In this study, there were few episodes of CNS infection manifesting with seizures. Comorbidities may be an important predictor in first episode. A detailed medical history is crucial. Seizures require long-term surveillance: they can occur even when underlying pathology is identified and medicated and may require hospitalization for clinical stabilization. Background: The first 1000 days of life, i.e. from conception to age 2 years, could be a critical period in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Carotid-intima media thickness (CIMT) is a surrogate marker of CVD. Although early-life risk factors, such as low birth weight or premature birth, are associated with increased CIMT in adults, it is unclear whether the relationship is present at younger ages. Objective: Our objective was to assess the relationship between exposures or interventions in the first 1000 days of life and CIMT in children through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were performed. Experimental and observational studies investigating the association between ultrasound CIMT and exposures or interventions at the child, familial, or environmental level, which occurred in the first 1000 days of life, were included. Data will be synthesized descriptively and, when appropriate, random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted. Funding: SNSF 32003B-163240. Results: A total of 5,561 publications were screened and 38 full-text publications, from 26 observational and 2 experimental studies, were retained. Observational studies comprised a total of 5,610 participants (0 to 18 years) and reported a wide range of exposures, from abnormal fetal growth to maternal dysglycemia or air pollution. Experimental studies comprised a total of 788 participants (5 to 8 years) and focused on nutritional interventions. Most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries, with 18 in Europe and only 2 in North America. Data analysis is ongoing and further results will be available by September 2019. Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate that the relationship between multiple early-life exposures or interventions and CIMT was evaluated across various populations and in different pediatric age groups. This systematic review will improve the knowledge on the mechanisms underpinning the developmental origins of CVD. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that complicated pneumonia should always be followed up until complete resolution of symptoms and radiologic findings, and that a round consolidation should always be suspicious. Background: Acute Bronchiolitis (AB) is a fairly common cause of hospitalization in children. In 2012, Portuguese national guidelines regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AB were issued, aiming to prevent doctors from requesting unnecessary diagnostic tests or using unhelpful drugs. The aim of this study is to determine if the guidelines were useful in changing the medical approach to children hospitalized with AB, in a second-level hospital. Methods: Inclusion criteria: every child with a first episode of AB below the age of 23 months that was hospitalized in Centro Hospitalar do M\u00e9dio Ave between October 2005 and March 2006 (Group A) and between October 2015 and March 2016 (Group B). Chi-square tests were performed, with a confidence interval of 95%. Results: A total of 84 children were included, 45 in group A (51.1% male) and 39 in group B (56.4% male). Median age was 4 months and 2 months, respectively. 100% of the children in group A got a chest X-ray and 93.3% got their blood tested, whereas in group B the frequency of chest x-rays and blood tests was 74.4% in both categories. Comparing both groups, we have a significant reduction regarding the use of both tests (p Conclusion: After the guidelines were published, there was a significant shift both in the use of diagnostic tests and therapeutic measures, however, there's still room for improvement.",

His chest radiograph showed bulky mediastinum so was referred to respiratory team. He was treated for atypical infection and echocardiography and abdominal USS were done and were unremarkable. CT chest showed mediastinal lymph node enlargement. The case was discussed with oncology/ radiology teams and agreed on treating as atypical infection. Serial chest radiographs revealed gradual improvement, then was lost for follow up for 10 months. When he was seen in clinic, a chest X-ray showed that the hilar prominence is still there, but was asymptomatic, and later on, in 2 months the changes were persistent, so he went on to have a thoracic MRI that revealed a mediastinal mass likely lymphadenopathy with a splenic lesion and an abnormal marrow signal along the spine. Splenic and bone marrow biopsies both showed no malignant cells. A PET scan revealed activity consistent with lymphoma that was later confirmed on axillary lymph node biopsy and the boy was subsequently started on chemotherapy.Conclusions and learning points: This case shows that it can be difficult to interpret mediastinal opacities on plain radiographs and in this case the CT scan has not changed the management significantly. PET scan helped guide further investigations. Biopsy of an appropriate site is the gold standard (as two biopsies from spleen and bone marrow were negative), and in this particular case, would have saved much effort and time. A 14 years old girl, known to have autism and eczema, was referred to general paediatrics by her GP with history of right lower chest pain for 2 years. Pain has worsened recently, became more central, was aggravated by exercise and with no relieving factors. Her clinical examination was normal. Chest X-ray was unremarkable, the pain was thought to be of musculoskeletal origin. A trial of salbutamol inhaler and antacid did not help her symptoms and she was referred to physiotherapy. She was assessed by the physiotherapist who referred her to the respiratory clinic to rule out exercise induced laryngeal obstruction. She was seen in clinic 2 months later, where the chest radiograph was repeated and revealed mediastinal enlargement. Her echocardiography and spirometry were normal. She went on to have a CT chest that confirmed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A thoracoscopic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. She completed the treatment protocol and subsequent work up showed no residual disease; she is currently asymptomatic under regular follow up.Conclusions and learning points This case presented with shortness of breath on exertion which was thought to be due to dysfunctional breathing, which is an unusual presentation of a mediastinal mass. A normal radiograph at the first presentation should not cause hesitation in repeating it especially with persistent symptoms. Tissue biopsy is the gold standard investigation in such cases. Introduction: Tuberculosis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Diagnosing the pulmonary tuberculosis can be challenging in infants and young children since clinical and radiological signs can be non-specific. Purpose: The main purpose of this case report is to highlight the challenge of diagnosing tuberculosis in young children. Materials and Methods: We present the case of a 3 months baby, admitted in Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Hospital in October 2018 for rhinorrhea and fever. Case Description: A previously healthy 3-months-old male was brought to the emergency department due to rhinorrhea in the previous 10 days and fever in the admission day. At the clinical examination, he had a good general appearance, rhinorrhea, spastic cough and symmetric breathing sounds in the pulmonary auscultation. The blood analysis revealed elevated platelets count and C-reactive protein with anemia. The chest radiography showed a density in the left upper lobe. Given this workup, the patient was diagnosed with Pneumonia, admitted and treated with Ceftriaxone. Fever persisted during the first 10 days of hospital stay. At the insistent resumption of the anamnesis, we found out that the father was hospitalized about 2 years ago for Tuberculous Pleurisy. A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing stricture in the area of left upper bronchus. The lung computer tomography confirmed the upper left atelectasis and several hilar and mediastinal adenopathies that amputated the left main bronchus. The baby and his mother started anti-tuberculosis treatment with good clinical evolution. Conclusion: Primary pulmonary tuberculosis in childhood is a difficult diagnose to make. Radiographic features, even if it may compress the trachea or main bronchus causing external stenosis, can be misleading. Rethinking the case and inclusion of the anamnestic data can lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, therefore avoiding disastrous consequences. Objective. Identify relationship of indoor aerosol pollution and morbidity in primary school children.Materials and methods. Indoor aerosol pollution was measured in 7 schools in Vilnius (Lithuania) in 2017-2018. Retrospective analysis of 6-11 years old patients health history (number of upper and lower respiratory infections) from records of outpatient clinics was performed. 953 pupils from primary schools were involved. Total aerosol particle number concentration (PNC) in the size range of 0.01 -1.00 \u03bcm was estimated using a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC, TSI model 3007). Particle number and mass concentrations in the size range of 0.3 -10 \u03bcm were measured using an Optical Particle Seizer (OPS, TSI model 3330).Background: There was no standardised process for providing repeat prescriptions for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) attending our department. Risks of poor patient compliance with medications and medication error were identified. Aim: Using the SMARTacronym (Specific, Measurable, Applicable, Realistic, Timely) the aim was to increase the number of repeat prescriptions written after review appointment, from a baseline of 0% to 100%, for patients with CF. Methods: Current practice in our department is that parents contact the CF team as needed for repeat prescriptions. Using the fishbone diagram and process map, we identified variation within the system. After meeting with the CF multidisciplinary team (consultants, registrars, nurses and pharmacist) we identified change ideas. The first Plan/Do/ Study/Act (PDSA) cycle was to write classic repeat prescriptions during each clinic visit. Then we applied PDSA for both classic and electronic high-tech prescriptions. A final cycle then included preparing and processing all prescriptions after clinic. Results: There are 100 patients with CF attending our tertiary referral CF centre. Number of repeat prescriptions written at the end of the clinic (primary outcome measure) increased to 100% from 0%. There are 4-12 patients per clinic and every patient requires prescription medication. All prescriptions are checked by the CF pharmacist. Previously we received approximately 5 parental requests per day, each taking typically 20 minutes to process (balancing measures). By improving the primary outcome, we improved balancing measures and reduced the time spent daily on repeat prescriptions.Conclusion: By improving the prescribing process, we minimised the waste within the department and for the patients. We transferred the responsibility for the repeat prescriptions from the patients to medical team, we improved medication safety and reduced patient risk. Background: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of ventricular myocardial repolarization characterized by a prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) that can lead to ventricular arrythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. LQTS may be congenital or acquired. The gold standard therapy is b-blockers, usually propranolol or nadolol. In patients with LQTS, b 2 agonist therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events. Case presentation summary: An 1-month old boy, with personal history of congenital LQTS, family history of congenital LQTS type 2 and pending genetic study, with prescribed propranolol but failure to adherence (his mother decided no to follow the prescription), was admitted to the pediatric department due to acute bronchiolitis. On his second day of hospitalization there was a clinical worsening, with respiratory effort, prostration and feeding difficulties. He presented with type 1 respiratory failure and signs of dehydration. Promptly initiate oxygen therapy but he maintained signs of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Due LQTS, it was not possible to prescribe nebulized salbutamol or adrenaline, so it was decided transfer to the Intensive Neonatal Unit Care to high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy. There was favourable clinical outcome: he required HFNC during four days, maximum flow of 7L/min and humidified O 2 concentration of 30%, general condition improved and appetite increased. He remained hemodynamically stable, without any cardiac event.There was a positive rapid test for respiratory syncytial virus. Learning Points/Conclusion: Bronchiolitis is one of the most common infection during the first two years of life. The general management include, in mild to severe forms, bronchodilators as salbutamol or adrenaline. In this case, due to LQTS, those drugs are not recommended and there are very limited therapeutic options. In resume, we would like to highlight the challenging in the management of a mild bronchiolitis in case of infants with LQTS. Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon entity in pediatric practice, with a peak of incidence during adolescence, particularly affecting tall, thin males. It is defined as free air within the mediastinum and its etiology is multifactorial, spontaneous or idiopathic. The most common symptom of spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is chest pain; however, most patients are asymptomatic. The pain is characteristically pleuritic, retrosternal and intensified by movement, breathing, and position changes. Other common symptoms are dyspnea, cough, neck pain, odynophagia and dysphagia. We report a case of a previously healthy, 15-year-old male adolescent, high performance athlete, who was admitted to the hospital with three days evolution chest pain, which began a few hours after an intensive sports practice. The pain irradiated to the neck and was intensified by deep breathing. No shortness of breath, weakness, heart palpitations or other heart symptoms were associated. There was no history of respiratory infections, invasive procedures or trauma in the previous days. On physical examination he had palpable subcutaneous neck emphysema and a crunching sound in cardiac auscultation, synchronous with the heartbeat. Chest and neck radiography confirmed ectopic air in the mediastinum and subcutaneous neck emphysema. The treatment consisted in rest and avoidance of maneuvers that could increase pulmonary pressure. Clinical symptoms resolved after 5 days and there were no radiologic findings at a 7 day follow up. Hamman`s sign, Hammond`s sign or Hammond`s crunch is a rare but pathognomonic sign characterized by a crunching, rasping sound, synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium. This sound is produced by the heart beating against air-filled tissues. SPM diagnosis can be made by physical examination and chest radiography or computed tomography may be helpful to document the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of physical examination in SPM diagnosis, especially in the presence of the pathognomonic Hamman's sign. Background: Pleuropneumonia takes a prominent place in childhood morbidity. Very often in children it can be manifested with atypical clinical presentation. Objective: To present atypical case of Pleuropneumonia in a seven year old boy. Methods: Seven year old boy with acute onset headache, abdominal pain, vomiting and febrile. On physical examination conscious, febrile (39 C), pale, dehydrated, pharynx hyperemic, abdominal distension and pain on abdominal palpation. Blood test with leucocytosis (Le= 31), elevated infalamotory markers (CRP=221mg/l), abdominal ultrasound with normal findings. Abdominal x ray -Mesohypogastric righ with distended intestinal viscera and with hydroaeric levels in formation. Due to suspicion of an acute abdomen, the child was transferred to the surgical department. After 12 hours of obsrevation still febrile, dehydrated, but with acute appearance of tachidispnea and chest pain on the left hemitorax. On examination febrile 40 C, tachidispnoic. Lung auscultation -vesicular breathing weakened to the left in the middle and basal parts. Chest x ray -Paracardiac basal left with larger zone of non-homogeneous shading in addition to inflammatory consolidation, right with peribronchitic infiltrates and sings of pleural effussion -Left dome of the diaphragm isn't followed and left frenicocostal sinus is shaded. Pleural ultrasound showed pleural effusion in left frenicocostal sinus.",

Control chest x ray and pleural ultrasound with complete regression of inflammatory consolidation and pleural effusion. Conclusion: Very often pleuropneumonia in children can be manifested with atypical clinical picture and it's a diagnostic and therapeutic problem because it's often not recognized and not thought of. Background: Several evidence-based clinical guidelines for bronchiolitis discourage the use of antibiotics. It was identified that our center was using non-recommended evidence-based care for the treatment of bronchiolitis. Objective: We aimed to gather and analyze data from our center on the trends of bronchiolitis management and on the factors that prompts physicians to prescribed antibiotics. Methods: Retrospective observational study accomplished by reviewing charts of children less than 2 years with a discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis from September 2018 to March 2019. The study included 76 infants and children between the age 0-24 months with discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Patients were divided into two groups. Both groups were treated with inhaled bronchodilators. Group A did not receive any antibiotics and patients in Group B received antibiotics. Group A included 34 patients with mean age of 5.5 months. Group B included 42 patients, 8 patients were excluded due to documented diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Mean age of patients in group B 11.8 months.Results: No statistical significant difference was observed in the length of hospital stay in two groups. (Group A, mean 3.18 Group B mean 3.68, p= 0.38).There was no significant difference between the two groups on the percentage of RSV/flu positive cases (Group A 14% vs Group B 12%) and percentage of CXR abnormalities (Group A 62.5% vs Group A 61.1%).There was a statistically significant difference between CRP values in two Groups (Group A CRP mean 8.39, Group B CRP mean 19.63 p=0.012). Conclusions: Antibiotics do not change the clinical course in bronchiolitis.We plan to implement new evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for our center for the upcoming RSV season.CPR levels need to be interpreted with caution when treating children with bronchiolitis and not to be used alone as a predictor for a concomitant bacterial infection. Background: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is the presence of air in the mediastinum in the absence of traumatic or iatrogenic causes. It is rare in pediatric age and several precipitating factors are described. It is usually benign and self-limited, and treatment is supportive. Case Report: A 17-year-old male, with a previous right spontaneous pneumothorax submitted to thoracentesis 14 months before, immunizations updated, presented to our emergency department with sudden suprasternal thoracic pain throughout a handball training, which worsened with inspiration and cervical mobilization, in the last 24 hours. He also had an history of odynophagia and sporadic coughing and an upper respiratory infection two weeks ago. He denied fever, trauma, medications or drug use. He was hemodynamically stable, oxygen saturation 100%. His weight was 55 kg (10th centile) and height 170 cm (15-50th centile). On physical examination he had suprasternal subcutaneous crepitations and tonsilar erythema. The chest radiograph revealed linear air leaks along the mediastinal borders, without pneumothorax, and the lateral radiograph showed paratracheal air and suprasternal subcutaneous emphysema. Pharingeal Group A Streptococcus test and C-reactive protein were negative and blood count was normal. IgM antibody Mycoplasma pneumoniae was positive. He presented sinus bradycardia in the electrocardiogram. Treatment included supplemental oxygen and azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day for five days. He had no need of analgesia. At the second day of hospitalization he was asymptomatic. The chest and lateral radiograph 4 days after admission showed almost complete resolution of the pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. IgM antibody Mycoplasma pneumoniae remained positive one month after episode. Discussion: In this case, physical activity, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection with cough and longilineus habit could be the triggering factors. The autors pretend to alert to the occurrence of this pathology with nonspecific symptoms, requiring a high level of suspicion for a correct diagnosis. Background: Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare cause of alveolar hemorrhage characterized by iron deficiency anemia, hemoptysis and pulmonary infiltrates. The diagnosis implicates the exclusion of other disorders causing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Treatment is not well established and consists on glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressant agents. Case Report: Nine-year-old child with type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed by the age of three and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis diagnosed at five. At diagnosis, he presented with severe anemia (Hb 4.9 g/dL) and after exclusion of infectious, gastrointestinal and hemolytic causes, the study revealed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy revealed hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Other causes of pulmonary hemosiderosis were excluded. Autoimmune study was negative. Initially treated with intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, monthly pulses), prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine. After three months, a pulmonary computerized scan revealed no evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage. He completed six methylprednisolone pulses, eight months of prednisolone and 13 months of hydroxychloroquine. Two months later, he had a relapse of pulmonary hemorrhage and reinitiated corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. He repeated methylprednisolone pulses, maintained prednisolone for 20 months and maintained hydroxychloroquine until nowadays. Eight months after suspending prednisolone, and while on treatment with hydroxychloroquine, he had a new relapse of pulmonary hemorrhage, reinitiating prednisolone. While on corticosteroids, glycemic control required insulin adjustment. Conclusions: The treatment of this condition on a child with type 1 diabetes mellitus is challenging, since glycemic control is very difficult and demands high insulin doses. The coexistence of type 1 diabetes mellitus rises questions on the idiopathic etiology, since autoimmunity is one of the etiologies proposed for this disorder. During follow-up, we understood that the suspension of corticosteroids, even maintaining hydroxychloroquine, lead to the relapse of pulmonary hemorrhage. It is important to manage the balance between pulmonary hemorrhage control and glycemic control in order to minimize the sequels from both disorders.",

The formation of wheezing is determined by the anatomical organism's features, as well as the nature and severity of the inflammatory process of the bronchial tree which is the result of the interaction of genetic, medical, biological, social factors. Objective: To determine the informativity of the study of polymorphism of the gene of microsomal epidergylysis (EPOX1) to predict the development of wheezing in acute bronchitis in children.Methods. The checkup was conducted on 54 children aged from 3 to 5 years with acute bronchitis. The group of 28 children (51.9%) with the acute form of bronchitis with wheezing manifestations was the most observed. The comparison group 26 children (48.1%) with acute bronchitis without wheezing.Determination of the genetic polymorphism of Tyr113His in the EPOX1 gene was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction.Results. The diffusion of the single-nucleotide replacement genetic polymorphism of Tyr113His in the EPOX1 gene in children with acute bronchitis has been studied. It was established that the homozygous Tyr/Tyr Results: 495 hospitalizations due to respiratory causes were evaluated, totalizing 30,3% of the total of 1.632 general hospitalizations. The majority occurred in patients younger than 1 year old. The most prevalent diagnosis was pneumonia, 67%, followed by bronquiolitis, 19,5%, and the existence of both, 13,5%. Males were the most affected with 63%. There were more hospitalizations in the fall of 2018. 4,4% of patients were in the intensive care unit due to these respiratory infections and 8,4% were readmissions. Conclusion: There was an increase in the number of hospitalizations for respiratory infections in the fall and winter periods. It is empirical that the means of prevention of lower respiratory infections be improved in order to reduce the number of cases observed. Goals: To analyze clinical and demographic variables possibly associated with the prescriptions of non-recommended but routinely used therapies for infants with acute viral bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "A cross-sectional study included hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus. Those with other associated infections and/or morbidities were excluded. The data were collected from medical records. Results: Among 120 cases, 90% used inhaled beta agonists, 72.5% corticosteroids, 40% antibiotics and 66.7% inhaled hypertonic saline solution. The use of bronchodilators did not present an independent association with another variable. More frequent use of corticosteroids was associated with low oximetry, longer hospitalization time and age3 months. Antibiotic therapy was associated with the presence of fever, longer hospitalization and age3 months. Inhaled hypertonic saline solution was associated with longer hospitalization time.Conclusions: Non-recommended prescriptions were frequent. Corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy were associated with signs of severity, as expected, but interestingly, they were more frequently used in infants above 3m, which suggested less safety in the diagnosis of viral bronchiolitis in these patients. The use of bronchodilators was even more worrying since they were indiscriminately used, without association with another variable related to the severity or characteristics of the host. The use of inhaled hypertonic solution, although not associated with severity, seems to have implied a longer hospitalization time. The identification of these conditions of greater vulnerability to the prescription of inappropriate therapies contributes to the implantation of protocols for the bronchiolitis treatment, for continuing education and for analysis of the effectiveness of the strategies employed. Background: Pertussis is a disease caused by Bordetella pertussis (BP), being more frequent and severe in infants less than 1 year old. Respiratory viruses (RV) may mimic pertussis in infants. Methods: A prospective cohort study with children under 1 year of age hospitalized with suspected clinical pertussis between 2014 and 2016 and submitted to etiological research to identify BP (nasopharynx swab for culture and/or PCR) and RV (nasopharyngeal aspirate for indirect immunofluorescence). Clinical, demographic and follow up data were collected. Results: During the study period, 59 infants were analyzed. In 30.5% there was identification of BP, in 39% of some respiratory virus. In four (7%), there was BP detection and some RV. In the bivariate analysis they presented a greater chance of BP infection: lower age, no fever, not being vaccinated, leukocytosis 20,000/mm 3 , lymphocytosis 10,000/mm 3 and RV infection: wheezing. After adjustment for confounders, the largest predictors for BP independently were: no wheezing (OR = 5.7) and leukocytosis 20,000/mm 3 (OR = 5.38). The number of patients with codetection did not allow the comparative analysis of severity with those with single agent. Conclusion: Clinical/laboratory characteristics suggest, but are not pathognomonic, of the etiologies, which corroborates the need for VR and BP research in this clinical situation. Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute inflammatory vasculitis defined by clinical criteria. Coronary artery (CA) aneurysms may occur, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Young infants are at increased risk, as prevalent incomplete forms pose diagnostic difficulties that often delay timely treatment.Objective: This work aims to raise awareness to incomplete KD trough a clinical case, highlighting its complexities. Clinical Case: Previously healthy 6 month-old female admitted with high fever, rhinorrhea, cough and irritability for 4 days. Besides bilateral ocular hyperaemia, the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, C-reative protein 128 mg/L, mild normocytic normochromic anaemia and significant leukocyturia. Lumbar puncture revealed limpid liquor with pleocytosis (414/uL) and normal biochemistry. Ceftriaxone was initiated. During hospitalization, intermittent polymorphous exanthema, hands and feet oedema were observed. Persistent fever, fluctuant after day 5, and irritability accounted for progressive therapeutic escalation with vancomycin and meropenem whilst awainting for a positive result of liquor bacterial DNA; after confirmed contamination, anphotericin B was started. Repeated and extensive blood, urine, liquor and respiratory secretions studies showed no evidence of causative infectious agent. Electroencephalogram was normal. Other analytic findings: thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and sedimentation rate 111mm/h. At day 16 after admission, an echocardiogram revealed left and right coronary ectasia, and KD was confirmed. She received intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, high-dose oral acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 60mg/kg/day, with further favourable clinical and analytic evolution. Periungual desquamation was noticed during 3 rd week. She was discharged for ambulatory follow-up after 28 days, with oral ASA (low dose). Conclusion: Incomplete KD is a clinical challenge, especially in infants. Heterogeneous laboratory findings and unspecific clinical features may be misleading. A high index suspicion is fundamental, as correct diagnosis might rest upon detection of CA abnormalities. Prompt adequate treatment has a potential prognosis impact, besides limiting further futile therapeutic interventions. Juvenile localized Scleroderma is one of the pediatric rheumatological disorders that primarily affect the skin and subcutaneous tissue beside the other type which is systemic sclerosis as it is rare in pediatric population . Management of such diseases is really crucial as its significantly effects the health and the life quality of the children. Data shows the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in association with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active JLS especially in progressive linear scleroderma and generalized or pansclerotic morphoea. If MTX is ineffective or the disease relapses after a period of clinical remission or in the case of MTX-intolerance mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may be used despite the lack of good evidence in the literature. Few studies shows that using of tocilizumab is safe, well tolerated and may have therapeutic benefit in the cases with severe and refractory JLS. In this case which is first time reported in Saudi Arabia describing the response and the efficacy of Intereuken-6 Antagonist in JLS . Recurrent fevers are a diagnostic challenge in Pediatrics which requires a systematic structured approach since differential diagnosis is vast. The authors present the case of a 14 year-old caucasian girl, with no relevant family history. She presented with recurrent fevers since the first year of life, with a duration of 3-7 days at variable intervals (1-6 months). Accompanying symptoms included oral ulcers, cervical lymphadenopathies and arthralgia. She was assyntompatic between attacks, with normal growth and development. After excluding infectious, neoplastic and autoimmune causes, a PFAPA diagnosis was assumed. The patient was treated with a 1-2 day course of prednisolone with favorable response.At age 12 she presented with genital ulcers during a febrile episode and was referred to our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit. During our evaluation, she complained also of macular rash and abdominal pain with ocasional diarrhea during the episodes. Investigations during attacks revealed increased inflammatory markers (IM), IgA, IgD and urinary mevalonic acid. Between attacks IM are normal, with mild anemia. Genetics identified MVK variants c.79-2AG and c.1129GA in heterozygosity, which confirmed HyperIgD syndrome (HIDS) diagnosis. She\u00b4s receiving NSAIDs and rare short courses of steroids during attacks with adequate control.Her 9 year-old brother was then brought to our attention with a history of recurrent fevers and rash since the first year of life. Currently, he presents with 6-7 episodes/year, 5-6 days duration, associated with painful cervical lymphadenopathies and occasional diarrhea and artralgia. His genetic study identified the same MVK variants, confirming a HIDS diagnosis. HIDS is an autosomal recessive autoinflamatory syndrome caused by mutations in the MVK gene. Its presentation is very variable but usually early onset, and can be confused with PFAPA. Diagnosis is paramount for its therapeutic implications, monitoring for secondary amyloidosis and to detect other cases within the same family, such as in this case. Background: Enuresis is a common problem that affects approximately 15% of children and adolescents. Although it can resolve spontaneously, in most cases it can lead to low self-esteem and dysfunctional family and social relationships, especially among pairs. Meticulous approach, identification of comorbidities and behavioral/pharmacologic treatment are for that reason fundamental. Objective: To alert pediatric community regarding association of enuresis and hypermobility syndromes. Methods: Case report from suburban hospital in Portugal. Results: We report the case of a ten year old boy, with family history of spina bifida with enuresis (mother) and primary enuresis (brother) but no relevant personal history. He was first referred to Pediatric consultation for primary nonmonosymptomatic enuresis. No previous response to behavioral measures or desmopressin. Physical examination revealed skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility of the shoulders and the 1 st phalangeal-metacarpal joint of both hands, with subluxation. The score of Beighton was 4, foot/height relation 0,15 and upper segment/lower segment relation 0,89, with no other marfanoid habitus characteristics. Behavioral measures were reinforced and it was associsted oxybutynin to the ongoing treatment with a decrease of 50% of enuresis episodes. Genetic study confirmed Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Conclusion: Enuresis is a multifactorial dysfunction with known association with hypermobility syndromes. Dysautonomia had probably a central role in the etiology of enuresis in this case report, do to scarcity of autonomic nerves associated with mutation of collagen, which leads to structural changes of bladder. Kawasaki disease (KD) is a disease of unknown cause whose main symptom is systemic vasculitis due to immune reaction frequently seen in children. The patients rarely develop fatal episodes, coronary artery aneurysm even after established IVIg treatment. Useful biomarkers are required for accurate treatment. From January 2013 to March 2015, all patients with Kawasaki Disease admitted to Pediatrics at Aichi Medical University Hospital were requested consents and obtained plasma was saved before IVIG administration. We examined the correlation between plasma values of PTX3, sCD24-ST (Presepsin) and NT-proBNP and acute coronary artery lesion (CAL) and coronary sequelae in KD. We also examined the IVIG dose number correlated with the severity to measure the predictive ability of the test value. Total 97 cases were registered. 22 case of incomplete KD were excluded from PTX3 analysis. 75 case of complete KD were concluded for statistical analyses. Of the 75 patients with KD, three had CAL and the rest 72 cases did not have (non-CAL group). These were confirmed by echocardiography. Statistically significant difference was seen only in PTX3 among the correlation with coronary lesion acute phase disorder, coronary artery sequelae. 1) When the cutoff value was set at 19.1 ng/ml of PTX3, the specificity was 63.03, and the sensitivity was 72.73, and the likelihood ratio was 19.1 in acute phase CAL. When the cutoff value was set at 68.85 ng/ml of PTX3, specificity 98.21, sensitivity 100, and its likelihood ratio was 56 in coronary artery sequelae. 2) The statistical correlation with PTX only IVIg doses was observed. The r values (correlation coefficients) of PTX3, P r e s e p s i n , a n d NT-p r o B N P w e r e 0 . 5 3 9 8 , 0 . 0 1 8 9 3 , a n d 0.05664,respectively.In this cohort, Kobayashi's Score (KS) was also checked. ROC of IVIG response and KS AUC 0.5188 95%, confidence interval [0.3288 to 0.7088], P value 0.8366 IVIG response and PTX3 AUC 0.907995%, confidence interval [0.8275 to 0.9883], P value",
