Evidence evaluating the association between NOAF and patient-important outcomes in this population is conflicting. Furthermore, little is known regarding the association between NOAF and resource use or hospital costs. Methods: Retrospective analysis (2011-2016) of a prospectively collected registry from two Canadian hospitals of consecutive ICU patients aged \u2265 18 years. We excluded patients with a known history of AF prior to hospital admission. Any occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was prospectively recorded by bedside nurses. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate contributors to total cost. Results: We included 15,014 patients, and 1541 (10.3%) had NOAF during their ICU admission. While NOAF was not associated with increased odds of hospital death among the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.08]), an interaction was noted between NOAF and sepsis, and the presence of both was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09-1.36]) than either alone. Patients with NOAF had higher total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02-1.20]). Among patients with NOAF, treatment with a rhythmcontrol strategy was associated with higher costs (CR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07-1.40]).

Most importantly, our database lacks the granularity to investigate other potential factors that may influence outcome from NOAF, such as underlying cardiac function, pulmonary artery catheterization, rate of AF, timing of AF (particularly in relation to onset of critical illness), use of anticoagulation, and incidence of other arrhythmias. Some outcome data, such as incidence of stroke, were not available. We additionally excluded patients with existing AF on the basis of known or documented AF, but it is possible that patients may have had pre-existing AF and not known, due to absence of symptoms [39] . Overall, this lack of granularity represents an important limitation in our study. Second, patients were included on the basis of prospective identification by nursing staff. While similar methods have been used at other institutions [40] , it is possible that cases of NOAF were missed using this methodology, particularly if AF was brief and transiently", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 273, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1173, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Lifetime risk for development of atrial fibrillation: the Framingham Heart Study", "authors": [{"first": "Lloyd-Jones Dm", "middle": [], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Leip", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Larson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Levy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Vasan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["S"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "&apos;agostino", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Massaro", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Beiser", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Wolf", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["A"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Circulation", "volume": "110", "issn": "9", "pages": "1042--1048", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Impact of atrial fibrillation on the risk of death: the Framingham Heart Study", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Benjamin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Wolf", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "&apos;agostino", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Silbershatz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Kannel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Levy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1998, "venue": "Circulation", "volume": "98", "issn": "10", "pages": "946--52", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Atrial fibrillation in the ICU", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Bosch", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Cimini", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Walkey", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2018, "venue": "Chest", "volume": "154", "issn": "6", "pages": "1424--1458", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "New-onset atrial fibrillation in adult critically ill patients: a scoping review", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Wetterslev", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Haase", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Hassager", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Belley-Cote", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Mcintyre", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "An", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Shen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Cavalcanti", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Zampieri", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Guimaraes", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2019, "venue": "Intensive Care Med", "volume": "45", "issn": "7", "pages": "928--966", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Incidence and prognosis of sustained arrhythmias in critically ill patients", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Annane", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": [], "last": "Sebille", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Duboc", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Le", "middle": [], "last": "Heuzey", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Sadoul", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Bouvier", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Bellissant", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "volume": "178", "issn": "1", "pages": "20--25", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Epidemiology and management of atrial fibrillation in medical and noncardiac surgical adult intensive care unit patients", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Kanji", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Williamson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Yaghchi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Albert", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Mcintyre", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "J Crit Care", "volume": "27", "issn": "3", "pages": "326--321", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in critically ill patients with sepsis.
