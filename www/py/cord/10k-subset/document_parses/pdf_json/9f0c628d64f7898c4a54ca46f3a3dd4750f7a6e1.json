Using E. coli (genome size, 4.6 X 10 6 base pairs) as standard, which by the same procedure had a Cot Y2 of 6, it was possible to convert the rate constants to base sequence complexity expressed as number of base pairs. The base sequence complexity can be viewed as an index of divergence between repeated sequences and the nine species classified in two groups, A and B ( kinetic complexity for the middle repetitive sequences of 0.52 x 10 6 base pairs.

The species were not selected other than for the availability of their seed. Their range of total DNA was 22.4 picograms. If the difference in amounts of DNA between species is 3.90 picograms, then the 21 species should fall into six or seven groups. The mean nuclear DNA amounts plotted against the total chromosome volume in Figure Table 2 . An analysis of variance of the amounts of DNA shows significant differences between the species within the groups but by far the greater amount of variation, 98% in the component analysis, is due to the differences between groups which are highly significant when tested against the within-group variation. The average interval between group DNA means is 3.72 picograms. A more rigorous classification of 12 of the 21 species was made using multivariate analysis.

The exceptionally large intra-cluster divergence of group D (215.0) suggests a large measure of divergence between the two species L. tingitanus and L. hirsutus for one or more characters. A comparison of the component D2's (square of the difference between the transformed uncorrelated means for each character) showed that 88.2% of the total divergence between L. tingitanus and L. hirsutus was accounted for by changes in amounts of DNA in heterochromatin. In Figure 3 , C-banded chromosome complements of L. hirsutus and L. tingitanus are compared. Whereas the banding pattern for L. hirsutus is typical for most of the Lathyrus species, the constitutive heterochromatin being confined to the centromeric regions in all chromosomes, chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 of L. tingitanus have additional intercalary bands on their short and long arms. 34.2% of the total chromosome volume in L. tingitanus is made up of constitutive heterochromatin, which is 10.72% higher than in L. hirsutus.

The rank totals for the 12 characters, obtained from all possible pairwise combinations of species, give information about the order of priority of the 12 characters in divergence, the inference being that the character with the smallest rank total has made the most contribution to cluster divergence, while characters with increasing rank totals have made correspondingly less. The component D2'S were summed over all combinations for each of the 12 characters and the D values calculated from the totals. These, as well as rank totals, are given in Table 7 , which shows that the order of priority of the characters in their contributions to cluster divergence was DNA in heterochromatin, non-repetitive DNA, total DNA, DNA in euchromatin, repetitive DNA and chromosome volume. Among the 12 characters, DNA in heterochromatin has contributed the maximum (57.42% of the total D2>s) to inter-cluster divergence followed by non-re- petitive DNA (23.4%), total DNA (7.00%), repetitive DNA (2.6%), and DNA in euchromatin (2.46%). 7.48% of the total D 2 was accounted for by the sum of component D2'S from seven chromosomes. Table 7 shows that the sum of the component D values for the seven chromosomes is consistently small when compared with the other characters. The table also shows that, with the minor exception of chroo mosome number 3, they have closely similar D values (mean 94.36). Chromosome 3 has a lower D value of 61.12. The close similarity between D values (and their rank totals) implies that the total chromosome variation among the 12 species is distributed at random among chromosomes within each complement. Total chromosome volume is directly correlated with nuclear DNA amount in Lathyrus species, hence a direct comparison of the DNA contained in individual chromosomes would tell us about the DNA distribution within each chromosome complement and a comparison between species would also give us information about its changes during evolution. The chromosomes of four Lathyrus species were C-banded using giemsa stain and the volume of heterochromatin and euchromatin were mea- sured separately for each chromosome. Using spot microdensitometry, it was established that heterochromatin is on average 1.6 times denser than euchromatin in the interphase nuclei of Lathyrus species from which it was possible to calculate the DNA content of each chromosome. The four species used in this analysis represented a two-fold variation in their nuclear DNA amounts. In Figure 4 the DNA amounts of the seven chromosomes, ranked according to DNA amounts of each species, are plotted against the mean amounts of all four species. The regression analysis shows that the slopes are strikingly similar for the four species, but as expected from the significant DNA variation between species, the differences between the means are highly significant. These results suggest that the quantitative DNA changes associated with speciation have affected all chromosomes within the Lathyrus complements. If we make the assumption that chromosomes which are assigned identical serial numbers in dif- Mean DNA. pq ferent species are homeologous to each other, then the joint regression would imply that the DNA changes were of the same magnitude in all chromosomes. No cytological evidence from interspecific hybrids is available at present to establish the homeologous relationship between different chromosomes, but the inference that quantitative DNA changes are accounted for by all chromosomes within each complement is supported by the results of molecular hybridization experiments (unpubl. results).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 732, "end": 739, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1309, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 2664, "end": 2672, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "4) Relative Role of Nuclear Characters in Species"}, {"text": "The experiment in brief was as follows.

The three satellite components together represented less than 7% of the total tingitanus DNA and could not be isolated from L. hirsutus included in group D. The low base sequence complexity of the satellite sequences and their relative absence in L. hirsutus would suggest that these sequences were amplified recently during the evolution of the genus. The satellite DNA retrieved using actinomycin-D was then transcribed into H3 labelled C-RNA using the method of Jones (1973) . The labelled C-RNA was hybridized in situ with the DNA in the metaphase chromosomes (Pardue and Gall, 1969) of L. tingitanus. The hybridization was repeated using six other Lathyrus species which contained less DNA in their genome than L. tingitanus. Autoradiographs showed that the satellite sequences are in the heterochromatin at, or near, their centromere in all chromosomes of L. tingitanus (Fig. 5) whereas they are smaller and occur only in some of the chromosomes in each of the other species.

Therefore, the arrangement in Table 7 may be the evolutionary progression within this genus. A comparison of the base sequence divergence among Lathyrus species was used to assess the evolutionary divergence between them. The middle repetitive and non-repetitive fractions of Lathyrus hirsutus DNA were isolated, radioactively labelled and then cross reassociated with the total DNA of six other species (L. tingitanus, L. odoratus, L. sphaericus, L. clymenum, L. articulatus and L. angulatus) which showed a wide range of variation in their nuclear DNA amounts.

If we assume eukaryotic organisms on average contain 55,000 structural genes, this would correspond approximately to 55 x 10 6 base pairs, which in turn amount to less than 0.06 picograms. This comprises a mere 0.09% of the total genome of L. miniatis which has the smallest genome size. This would imply that more than 99% of the total Lathyrus DNA carries no obvious genetic function. The remarkable stringency with which the C values of plant species are conserved over countless cycles of cell divisions, on the other hand, shows that specificity in DNA amounts, apart from its genetic information content, is vital to the organization and stability of the genome. Base sequence amplifications and deletions together with interspersion and divergence are essential for the evolution of plant genomes and these are reflected in the changes in nuclear fractions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The divergence and evolution in Lathyrus is accompanied by increase in both repetitive and non-repetitive components. Moreover the ratio between the two components is remarkably constant through the evolution of the genus . As in Lathyrus, many other plant and animal genera show consistently reg-ular ratios between repetitive and non-repetitive fractions in the extra DNA contributing to the DNA variation (Hutchinson et al., 1980) . The increase in the repetitive component can be readily conceived as due to the proliferation of repetitive sequences. We cannot, however, account for large increases in the non-repetitive DNA by extensive amplification of base sequences because by this means they would become repetitive. A possible explanation would be that the DNA increase was initially restricted to repetitive fraction followed by the generation of single copy sequences by mutations, deletions, insertions and base sequence rearrangements. The large scale base sequence divergence observed among families of repetitive sequences is a proof of such events taking place during the evolution of higher organisms. Thompson and Murray (1980) have also demonstrated a consistently regular quantitative relationship between single copy DNA and the total genome size in eukaryotes. In a comparison of the mung bean and pea genomes they have shown that most single copy sequences are in fact short interspersed elements from ancient repetitive families which have now diverged so that they no longer reassociate with one another under standard experimental conditions. However, some of the families could be detected by reassociation under low stringency conditions which tolerated more base pair mismatches. In their experiments almost all single copy DNA has reassociated with the kinetics expected for sequences present in one or two copies. Thermal denaturation profiles have also shown substantial amounts of base pair mismatches in the reassociated duplexes consistent with the assumption that they are obtained from divergent repeats. Watson (1965) has given the estimate that the replication error at the nucleotide level is of the order of 10-9 \u2022 From the frequency of hemoglobin variants in man the mutation rate per nucleotide per generation is estimated to be 4.4 x 10-8 , which is close to Watson's estimate (Nei, 1975) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 433, "text": "(Hutchinson et al., 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1146, "text": "Thompson and Murray (1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2056, "text": "Watson (1965)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2333, "text": "(Nei, 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "If we assume that the overall base sequence divergence took place at a constant rate during evolution, the constant ratio between repetitive and non-repetitive sequences in the extra DNA would imply that the DNA increase in Lathyrus also took place at a constant rate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The distribution of DNA within this genus, however, is not continuous.

An independent classification of nine Lathyrus species, which included species in B 1 and B 2 , based on the average kinetic complexity of their middle repetitive sequences, has shown that species in B 1 are different from those in B 2 ( Table 1 ). The average kinetic complexity is a theoretical estimate for base sequence divergence which restricts in vitro reassociation of denatured DNA. In broad and general terms the observed differences in the average kinetic complexity would suggest that the middle repetitive DNA for species in B 2 results from the rapid turnover of a relatively smaller variety of repetitive sequences repeated to a greater degree.

In the genus Clarkia, Lewis (1962) suggested that catastrophic selection followed by inbreeding, extensive chromosome breakage and rearrangements, with or without numerical chromosome changes, have played a very prominent role in the evolution of this genus. A survey of the DNA variation within this genus has shown that the 26 species measured for their DNA amounts clustered into four distinct groups. The DNA differences between groups are similar, the average being 2.1 picograms. The genus Nieotiana comprises 62 recognized species. Geographical barriers, amphidiploidization and karyotype rearrangements have promoted rapid speciation within this genus and there is a large variation in their chromosome numbers among diploid species (Goodspeed, 1954) . DNA measurements were made on 41 diploid and 10 amphidiploid species, falling into seven DNA groups. The DNA interval between groups is approximately 2 picograms, as in Clarkia. The DNA groups in Clarkia and Nieotiana can be shown to correspond broadly with their taxonomical classification by Lewis and Lewis (1955) and Goodspeed (1954) . Twenty-four Allium species (20 diploid and 4 polyploid) formed six DNA groups with an average interval of 4.2 picograms which is closely similar to that of Lathyrus. What is remarkable with Clarkia, Nieotiana and Allium is that the discontinuous changes show no correlation with numerical chromosome changes or with levels of polyploidy. While each species can be assigned to its DNA group, polyploid and diploid species with different basic chromosome numbers also occurred in the same DNA group (Narayan and Durrant, unpubl.).
