Poor public health and poor health in larger segments of society is an indicator of state failure. A lack of health care and human rights-on the other hand-can cause a country's failure. For the USA's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 113 cases of state failure over 38 years in countries with over half a million inhabitants were analysed and three aspects could be isolated with predictive power for incumbent state failure: high infant mortality, low democratization and low openness for international trade (State Failure Task Force 1999). The Council of Foreign Relations of the USA together with the Milbank Memorial Fund concluded: \"The United States can gain significant domestic and international advantages by placing health squarely on its foreign policy agenda. Supporting public health worldwide will enhance U.S. national security, increase prosperity at home and abroad, and promote democracy in developing countries and those in transition\" (Kassalow 2001) .

This was one of the strong political issues in favour of health, which still holds true. But only a few countries support the idea-and realize it-that health and education shall be guaranteed by law and law enforcement for everyone in society. Germany still is that old fashioned with its nearly universal coverage of a social health insurance and the inclusion of nearly complete services for nearly all complaints. It is an offspring of a social market economy, which intends to cover basic needs for all, based on solidarity and subsidiarity. Solidarity is incorporated, for example, in the income-based premiums for about 90% of the German population. Subsidiarity is shown in the fact that public legal corporations run the business and that these corporations are democratically elected. Sustainability, nevertheless, will require a strengthening of the subsidiarity principle in the sense that people must take basic health (care) into their own hands. Health is not only the state's responsibility, but also a responsibility that rests on the people. Thus, such a patterning of health affairs is based on values and principles-the health sector in Germany is a very interesting policy area with structural implications and messages for other sectors. Solidarity and subsidiarity could pattern other policies, as well. This could support a global structural policy that creates, stabilizes and protects the very preconditions for a healthy and stable global society.",

As many as 1.2 billion people are extremely poor with less than U.S. $1 daily and altogether 2.8 billion people live on less than U.S. $2 a day. Poverty attacks health and produces disease. The vicious circle between poverty, infection, and malnutrition still exists on a large scale. This is the so-called unfinished agenda in international health. About 200 million life years are lost yearly because of malnutrition and 85 million life years resulting from poor water and sanitation (World Bank 1997). Many other diseases are directly linked to poverty. Poor countries have difficulties in tackling these diseases: 11% of global health spending goes for 93% of the global disease burden (Gwatkin 2000) . Private and public poverty coincide in a context of tremendous income inequalities.",

Simply increasing income would not suffice, because of widespread lack of empowerment and because of the many life shocks that the poor experience, which quite often absorb any additional income. On behalf of the World Bank, more than 60,000 poor in more than 60 countries were interviewed in an attempt to understand poverty. The book series Voices of the poor is a very remarkable background document of the millennium declarations (Narayan 1999 (Narayan , 2000 . Analysing carefully its content, it turns out that severe illness or accidents of family members can drain away any savings intended to be used for small entrepreneurial activities or for other emergencies. Solidarity within larger family networks absorbs any additional income. In India, for example, 25% of hospitalized patients' families fall into poverty from medical costs (Peters et al. 2002) . High private expenditures of some hospitalizations even throw middle class families into poverty if there is no social security net for health care. Good health insurance and hospital coverage for the poor are the preconditions necessary to develop and support family subsistence initiatives and small scale enterprises, which are needed urgently in view of increasing unemployment and underemployment in times of globalisation and resulting shrinking labour markets. A social security system for families' health risks reduces population growth considerably. The higher the mortality risks for children are, the exponentially higher the fertility rates will be to ensure that some of the surviving children will provide a safety net for their parents in old age. Having larger families is a form of private insurance, but it is insurance with a low efficiency. \"Societies with high rates of infant mortality (deaths under 1 year of age) and child mortality (deaths under 5 years of age) have higher rates of fertility, in part to compensate for the frequent deaths of children. Large numbers of children, in turn, reduce the ability of poor families to invest heavily in the health and education of each child, a process described by Gary Becker and colleagues as the 'quality-quantity tradeoff' in child rearing\" . Larger families are considered to be a result of and a risk factor for poverty. The smaller the families are the higher their human capital is. The vicious circle of poverty, ignorance and disease can be turned into a beneficial link between education, health and wealth, at the microeconomic level of families and at the macroeconomic levels of regions and countries.",

This traditional wisdom was challenged recently by a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, established by the World Health Organization to reassess the relationship between health and economic development. The commission and its many working groups assessed the available evidence on health and production and concluded that investments in health bring incredible economic returns. Scaling up essential health interventions in low-income countries with U.S. $66 billion would bring a return of U.S. $360 billion per year and possibly much more by the years 2015-2020 .

Investments in education, housing and other social arrangements added to this health-led development. -Many case studies from developing and transition economies after economic crises hint at the important pre-investments in health and education for subsequent economic growth; Sweden, Kerala and Costa Rica benefited from health-driven developments, whereas economy-driven developments such as in Brazil, India and Pakistan did not substantially benefit the poorest. -The African American population in the USA enjoys relatively high income levels and-as compared to much poorer populations in China and Kerala-low survival prospects. \"It turns out that Chinese men and those in Kerala in India decisively outlive American black men in terms of surviving to older age groups\" ). -Macroeconomic shocks in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and especially in Central Asia had very negative impacts on health because of lacking pre-investments in health and education. The excess mortality in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine between 1990 and 2000 was at 4 million people (Cornia 2001 ). -Finally, many econometric studies show that health is a long-term driver for economic growth.

But this is certainly not enough; it is just the continuation of good but old-fashioned recipes.

It requires alliances with the education sectors. And it requires commitment (Schwefel 2001) . Little money can save many lives and alleviate widespread suffering-a job for Sisyphus and not for large funds. In and between rich countries an exchange of experiences is on the agenda. In Europe we could learn much from so many other European countries, not just from those that are being represented predominantly in English-speaking journals.

Social marketing is needed to promote the basic idea that health and education need empowerment and security to create economic, social, cultural and democratic opportunities. The increasing globalization of civil pressure groups and their partnerships with other public-minded institutions of a global civil society should strengthen and empower the advocates of public goods and public health. Professional public health groups and associations and societies will be the main partners of this endeavour of globalizing information and ideas and trying to convert them into power. Cross-national and cross-institutional alliances are needed to promote the concept of brains and bodies as the backbone of development strategies. The globalization of the civil society \"contribute to our freedoms\", as Amartya Sen concludes . Globalization is not just a threat, it is an opportunity to grasp.",

These are traits of human beings and not of institutions. Excellent examples of personal stewardship exist at all levels of any society. The ethics of professionalism is a very important asset, indeed. Public health is not a fashionable label but a reminder of responsibility, for all its supporters and not just for those paid with tax money. Solicited or unsolicited, the representatives of governments and public institutions have to be checked by civil society alliances, to ensure they act in the public interest and according to the principles of the moral imperative: don't do to others what shouldn't be done to you.",
