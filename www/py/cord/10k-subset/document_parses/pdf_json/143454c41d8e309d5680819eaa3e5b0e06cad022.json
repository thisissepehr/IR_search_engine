A concentration of 40 ~zg DEAE-D/ml provided maximal enhancement of infection as determined by the time of onset of cytopaChic effect (CPE), the percentage of cells infected by the inocutum, and the amount of virus produced. When DEAE-D was used in the inoculum, the CPE appeared a day earlier, the percentage of cells infected by the inocnlum, as determined by the fluorescent antibody test, was increased 11 times, and the viral titer was increased 2 times as compared to results obtained without DEAE-D. Bovine respiratory syncy~ial virus-infected cultures contained much cell-associated virus which could be liberated by sonication to increase the titer of virus stocks. The use of BRSVinfected cells rather than supernates from BRSV-infected cells increased the rate at which a cytopathic effect developed, although it did not substantially increase the titer of virus which was harvested. The use of DEAE-D in the inoculum and the passage of BRSV-infected cells instead of virM suspensions was found to be the quickest and most effective method of consistently obtaining BRSV with a titer of about 105.5 TCIDs0/ml. 15 Arch.

Cultures were washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) to remove unattached virus and replaced with M E N containing 5 per cent FBS. At appropriate times the supernate was removed and centrifuged to remove unattached ceils and a sample of supernate was used for titration.

To compare titers of infectious virus obtained from the i) supernate, ii) cells, and iii) a mixture of supernate and sonicated cells, the procedure was varied so that after suspending the cells, they were centrifuged, suspended in a small volume of supernate, sonicated, and resuspended in the entire volume of supernate for titration.

The effect of different concentrations of DEAE-D on the infectivity of BRSV for B E L cells was evaluated by several criteria: number of cells infected by the inoculum, degree of CPE, and amount of infectious virus produced. Because of the ease of counting cells in semiconfluent cultures compared to the difficulty of counting ceils in a confluent culture, semi-coD_fluent cultures were used in FA tests to determine the number of cells infected with BRSV.

This effect occurred over a large range of concentrations of BRSV (Tables 2 and 3 ). The principal object of determining the capacity of DEAE-D to enhance dilute solutions of BRSV was to evaluate the feasibility of using DEAE-D in isolating BRSV from the respiratory tract of cattle. In both naturally and experimentally infected cattle, the isolation of BRSV has posed problems in that a CPE has not been identified until after subculture, and/or because of the short period of time over which the virus was recoverable (6, 1t, 13, 21) . Difficulties have been reported in the isolation of RSV from humans (4), which to some extent have been due to the loss of infectivity which occurs on freezing and thawing of the samples. However, even when nasal washings and nasal swabs are placed directly on susceptible cultures, BRSV has been difficult to isolate (Rossi and Kiesel, unpublished observations) . Using confluent cultures, DEAE-D enhanced infection with BRSV to the extent that the amount of virus harvested was about twice the amount harvested when DEAE-D was not used ( Table 3 ). The reason for the greater amount of virus harvested with DEAE-D in the inocutum ~han when it was not present probably reflects the greater infectivity of the inoculum. Since virus is produced more quickly with higher than with lower concentrations of BRSV, the sooner the virus can be harvested, the greater is the probability that the virus will not be inactivated.",

            "text": "The use of polyions, especially DEAE-D, to enhance infection has been investigated with a variety of viruses, including RSV (10, 12, 16, 22) . Although the mechanism of action of DEAE-D in enhancing BRSV infection was not investigated, work with laryngotracheitis virus (LTV), an avian herpesvirus, is probably applicable in explaining enhancement of other viruses with DEAE-D. Studies with LTV have conclusively shown that enhancement of infection with DEAE-D is due to increasing the attachment of virus to cells by the action of DEAE-D on cells, and that DEAE-D has no effect on virus particles themselves (16, 17) . Furthermore, work with LTV has shown that there is not a subpopulation of virus particles which lacks the capacity to attach to cells, but that the entire population is deficient in its ability to attach to cells. This by no means rules this out as a possibility for BRSV. The efficacy of using DEAE-D in the inoculum of :BI%SV in order to experimentally infect cattle is open to question, since DEAE-D probably has little affinity for the virus and might be diluted to insignificant concentrations in the respiratory tract of cattle. One should note, however, that in mice its use with eucephalomyocarditis virus has been shown to have a considerable enhancing effect (3).",

Sonication of BRSV.infected cells was found to be an effective method for liberating BRSV from infected cells in order to obtain higher titered virus stocks ( Table 5 ). The use of virus-infected cells was found to be more efficient in infecting cells than viral suspensions. Viral suspensions are limited in their infectivity by the capacity of one virus particle to infect only one cell, and by the fact that the percentage of virus absorbed from a large inoculum is much less than that absorbed from a small inoeulum (2) . As a consequence of the latter hmitation, increasing the volume of inoculum is not especially effective in increasing infection. However, virusinfected cells all settle to the monolayer and are probably capable of infecting more than one celI.",

Virus taken from the freezer is mixed with DEAE-D to a final concentration of 40 ~g/ml. When a 3~-CPE has been reached, cells from the supernate and those attached to the glass are used to inoculate a culture of BEL cells which cover u/4 the surface of the flask. When the CPE again reaches a 3 ~-CPE, the procedure is repeated until a sufficient number of flasks have been inoculated. Passage of cells is made at a 1 : 1 ratio to begin with and at a 1 : 2 ratio thereafter. When a sufficient number of flasks have been inoculated and the CPE reaches 3 + on the second to third day, the supernate is harvested and the cells sonieated in a small volume of supernate. This type preparation has been found to give the most consistently high titers of 105.3 to 105.9 TCID~0, although it is considerably lower than titers of 107.9 which we have obtained with RSV on ttEp-2 cells. However, the amount of BRSV produced can be estimated to be at least ll-fold greater than that determined in microtiter assays, or in any assay in which DEAE-D is not used in the inoculum. Since DEAE-D enhances RSV-infection, titers of RSV can also be considered to be low estimates of the infectivity which might be obtained under different conditions. It is possible that further studies using Bl%SV-infected cells as inoeula on BEL cells will reveal methods of obtaining higher titers of BRSV than have been achieved to date.",
