            "text": "Current treatments for ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced acute lung injury are limited. Mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (CM) has been reported to attenuate lung injury. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), a type of multipotent stem cells, are more easily obtained than mesenchymal stem cells. We hypothesize that NCSC-CM has anti-inflammatory properties that could protect against IR-induced lung injury in rats. In this study, NCSC-CM was derived from rat NCSCs. Typical acute lung injury was induced by 30-min ischemia followed by 90-min reperfusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected to analyze the degree of lung injury after the experiment. NCSC-CM was administered before ischemia and after reperfusion. NCSC-CM treatment significantly attenuated IR-induced lung edema, as indicated by decreases in pulmonary vascular permeability, lung weight gain, wet to dry weight ratio, lung weight to body weight ratio, pulmonary arterial pressure, and protein level in BALF. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 in the BALF were also significantly decreased. Additionally, NCSC-CM improved lung pathology and neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissue, and significantly suppressed nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activity and I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation in the lung. However, heating NCSC-CM eliminated these protective effects. Our experiment demonstrates that NCSC-CM treatment decreases IR-induced acute lung injury and that the protective mechanism may be attributable to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and the inflammatory response. Therefore, NCSC-CM may be a novel approach for treating IR-induced lung injury.",

Thus, it is imperative to discover innovative therapies to improve the treatment of this severe illness [1] . Recent experimental studies have suggested that allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have therapeutic potential in multiple preclinical injury models, such as myocardial infarction, diabetes, sepsis, graft-versus-host disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic failure, and acute renal failure [2] . Furthermore, MSC therapy has been investigated in various animal models of ALI/ARDS. These studies have shown the beneficial effects of MSCs in ALI/ARDS induced by bleomycin, ischemia-reperfusion (IR), live Escherichia coli bacteria, ventilator, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and cecal ligation and puncture [2] [3] [4] . Based on these preclinical studies, MSCs were suggested to reduce the severity of lung injury as well as enhance repair.",

            "text": "Originally, the protective mechanisms of MSCs were thought to occur through cell engraftment in the lung, which would repair the endothelial/epithelial cells or result in MSC differentiation into specific lung cell types. However, many subsequent in vivo studies demonstrated low engraftment rates (<1%) in lung injury models [2] . Additionally, the protective effect of MSCs was found to be comparable to MSC-conditioned medium (CM) alone [5] . Therefore, the beneficial effects of MSCs appear to be a result of the release of various paracrine factors with immunomodulatory properties. The use of MSC-CM has several advantages: MSC-CM can be easily generated, frozen, and transported, does not contain live cells, and cannot be rejected by the host immune system. Thus, the administration of MSC-CM may offer a new approach for the treatment of ALI/ARDS.",

The downregulation of proinflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) and the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2) have been shown to be the major factors in treating diseases, such as acute kidney and liver injury, acute stroke, and sepsis [2] . In these disease models, MSCs reduced the levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the BALF and plasma, which blocked the influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils into the injured tissue and prevented further damage [2] . Our study demonstrated that NCSC-CM decreased the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the BALF and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissue, similar to these previous reports.",

IL-6 also coordinates the anti-inflammatory activities essential for the resolution of inflammation [25] ; however, these effects are context dependent [25] . Investigations showed that IL-6 limited influenza virus-induced inflammation and protected against hyperoxic acute lung injury in animal models [26, 27] . Further, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in LPS-induced ALI were IL-6 mediated [28] . In contrast in ARDS patients, higher IL-6 levels in plasma and BALF were associated with poor outcomes [29] . Dental pulp-derived stem cell CM also reduced cardiac IL-6 mRNA levels following IR cardiac injury [30] . Further, ASC-CM decreased IL-6 production in air pouch exudates in the zymosan-induced mouse air pouch model and serum IL-6 levels in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury [31, 32] . These findings are comparable with our results.",

NF-\u03baB activation involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, which allows NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of inflammatory genes such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [33, 34] . Previous and current studies have revealed that IR-induced lung injury decreases I\u03baB-\u03b1 levels and induces NF-\u03baB signaling activation. The activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway triggered the Fig. 2 . Effect of NCSC-CM on pulmonary artery pressure (\u0394PAP).

In this study, we showed that NCSC-CM suppressed the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in IR lung injury by inhibiting the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. Consequently, NCSC-CM reduced the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 after IR injury to the lung. These results were similar to those of previous experiments showing that MSCs suppressed NF-\u03baB activation in reporter cells following incubation with LPS-inflamed serum and in IR lung injury in rats [35, 36] .",
