The impact of postoperative infection on patient's renal function has been widely accepted [5, 17] . From the perspective of pathophysiology, serious infection can result in systemic arterial vasodilation and intra-renal vasoconstriction, and it is also conducive to other kidney injuries [18, 19] . In addition, blood loss during the surgical procedure can lead to hemodynamic instability and hypotension after graft reperfusion [20, 21] , so blood loss was considered another risk factor related to ARF [5] . As the current analysis found, these two factors were also associated with the occurrence of postoperative ARF. Preoperative renal dysfunction has been evaluated as a potential strong predictor of postoperative ARF [22, 23] . To minimize the influence on the results, we excluded patients with preoperative Scr levels greater than 133 mmol/l from the analysis. Moreover, the total volume of cryoprecipitate transfusion was affected by the severity of end-stage liver disease and the etiology, so Child-Pugh grade and etiology were also adjusted in the analysis. After adjusting for these potential confounders, we still found a significant correlation between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and the occurrence of ARF following OLT. Because the definition of ARF in the current study was stringent, it might also have skewed the results because of the relatively small group of patients examined. We also compared the postoperative Scr level between the groups with and without cryoprecipitate transfusion after ruling out all patients with ARF. The results indicated that the Scr level in patients receiving cryoprecipitate transfusion was significantly higher than in those who did not receive it.

Patients with end-stage liver disease are characterized by reduced levels of coagulation factors, easily leading to coagulation disorders [26] . It is commonly thought that cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT can effectively provide fibrinogen and other coagulation factors to improve the function of blood coagulation and control intraoperative bleeding. This procedure is therefore widely applied in OLT centers. In our center, 40.4 % of patients had been transfused with cryoprecipitate at a mean volume of 12.8 U. Unfortunately, our study indicated that cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT is associated with the occurrence of postoperative ARF. More importantly, the data further revealed that the risk of ARF increased with the increase of cryoprecipitate transfusion until the critical point (16 U) had been reached.

Since there are some difficulties in real-time monitoring of the fibrinogen concentration during liver transplantation, blood test results play a lesser role in guiding the use of cryoprecipitate because of their time lag. Usually we can only determine the turnaround time for stopping the transfusion according to the surgeon's experience and the results of other tests, such as thrombelastography. Since the blood coagulation system is maintained in a state of low-level balance in patients with end-stage liver disease [31] , this protocol to guide cryoprecipitate use may easily cause a coagulation imbalance.
