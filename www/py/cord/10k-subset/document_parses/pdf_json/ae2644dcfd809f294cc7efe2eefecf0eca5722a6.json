In this report, we have summarized the long-term toxicities associated with the procedure as well as the outcome after a median follow-up of 11.7 years. Among the 90 patients who were evaluable, 27 (30%) were alive and well between 6.4 and 15.5 years after ABMT. Many other authors have reported comparable rates of EFS and survival among patients with AML. It has been reported that ABMT in the second and third CR has achieved results similar to those obtained with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 10, 12, 15, 28 The results of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study and of the EORTC indicated that the outcome of ABMT in first CR rivalled that of allogeneic BMT. 10, 17 Long-term disease-free survival after ABMT in AML might be better than conventional-dose post-remission therapy. 10, 12 Present evidence suggests that maintenance chemotherapy after early consolidation without ABMT does not prolong survival in AML patients. 29 In the report of the European Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the probability of long-term disease-free survival (DFS) was about 40% for patients autografted for acute leukemia in first complete remission (CR1) and 30%, if treated in CR2. 8, 9, 11 Our study confirms that the probability of long-term DFS for patients autografted in first CR is significantly better than that of patients transplanted in second or higher CR (EFS, P \u03ed 0.018; OS, P \u03ed 0.013), with 46.1% overall survival. In our hands, ABMT has therefore achieved a CCR rate that is more favorable than the rates accomplished with conventional chemotherapy. The very long-term outcome after transplantation was similar to that reported in the literature. 10, 12, 30, 31 Criticism could be raised that this was not a randomized trial and that we could not exclude selection of patients. The uncontrolled design of this retrospective study may have favored the selection of low-risk young patients. Furthermore, the significantly better prognosis of younger patients \u03fd40 years (DFS, P \u03ed 0.023; OS, P \u03ed 0.013) is an obvious bias. However, the influence of age should not be overestimated, as indicated by other authors. 32, 33 In the study period between 1983 and 1989, cytogenetic analysis was not generally available.

According to the standards at the time of transplantation, all four patients had an adequate amount of TNC (median 0.7 \u03eb 10 8 /kg; range, 0.39-1.1 \u03eb 10 8 /kg) in the autografts. One patient developed additionally secondary AML and died shortly thereafter. The other three patients all ultimately died of the consequences of MDS. In addition, seven patients had persistent thrombocytopenia more than 100 days after ABMT. Without the benefits of the initial cytogenetic finding or other genetic markers, the origin of the MDS cell clone remains speculative. Although there are extensive reports on the incidence of MDS after ABMT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] no data on the incidence of MDS in AML patients after ABMT are available.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1035, "end": 1039, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1044, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1064, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Long-term cardiac toxicity occurred in four patients (4.4%), one of whom also died as a result of cardiac complications.

The incidence of cataract formation after conditioning regimens containing TBI with ABMT in our study was 44%, compared to 50% in the reports of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. 44 It is of note that a lower incidence of fatal late events was observed among long-term survivors transplanted in CR1 (1/18) as opposed to those transplanted in CR2 or CR3 (3/9).

Applying a multivariate analysis to our patient population, patients with a cell dose of \u03fe1.0 \u03eb 10 8 TNC/kg experienced a significantly reduced 100-day mortality compared to those transplanted with a cell dose of \u03fd1.0 \u03eb 10 8 TNC/kg after adjusting for disease status and patient age at transplant. There was, however, no statistically significant difference in long-term EFS or overall survival between the two groups (P \u03ed 0.37, P \u03ed 0.49, respectively). Although a correlation between the dose of TNC/kg and engraftment with a peripheral blood granulocyte count of \u03fe0.5 \u03eb 10 9 was found (P \u03ed 0.01), no such relationship with platelet recovery could be established. Thus, in contrast to the report of Gorin et al 46 we could not find any relationship between cell dose and long-term outcome.
