            "text": "Recent experimental evidence suggests that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by increasing blood-brain barrier permeability and exacerbating posttraumatic edema. MMPs are zinc-dependent and cell surface-associated endopeptidases that cleave all extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen, laminin, and proteoglycans. The MMPs and their potential deleterious effects are tightly regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels through proform activation and by MMP tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) Two members of this family have a very specific and marked activity against gelatin and are termed gelatinases. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the secretion of gelatinases is significantly increased in cortical cultures when mechanical injury is simulated. In human TBI, data about the presence of gelatinases in the brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and their temporal profile, both in plasma and ECF, are still lacking. Sahuquillo's group [1] examined the acute profile of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the plasma of patients with moderate or severe TBI and, more interestingly, in the brain extracellular fluid (ECF). High levels of gelatinases were found in plasma and brain ECF in the early phase of TBI, indicating that both local and systemic trauma-induced upregulation of gelatinases in the acute phase might play an important role in the pathophysiology of TBI and could be a future therapeutic target.",

Mauritz [3] described ICP use in a sample of 1,856 severe TBI from a registry of patients admitted to Austrian ICUs between 1998 and 2004. Mauritz aimed to investigate reasons why patients did or did not receive ICP monitoring and to describe factors influencing hospital mortality after severe TBI. The ad hoc created statistical model explains only 37% of the variance of the use of ICP monitoring, but clearly showed that severity and age are importantly associated with ICP monitoring. The more severe, as the less injured, cases were less likely to be submitted to ICP. That is likely to reflect a clinical judgment concerning who can benefit from invasive monitoring. An evaluation of potential salvageability is part of the decisional analysis. Interestingly, no clear, standardized definition of ''salvageability'' is available. Older patients are less often monitored. The second aim of the paper was to analyze the impact of several predictors, including ICP monitoring, on mortality at hospital discharge. The study confirms a clear association between the number of cases treated by center per year and better outcome. This supports the benefit of centralization, as shown in TBI and other neurological non-traumatic pathologies. Finally, an additional result was that the subgroup with the highest rate of ICP monitoring had the lowest mortality suggesting a utility of monitoring and treating high ICP.",

Between others, the relationship between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP in neurocritical care patients has been explored [4] . A significant relationship between ONSD and ICP was recorded. Changes in ICP were strongly correlated with changes in ONSD. Enlarged ONSD was a suitable predictor of elevated ICP. Even if the studied cohort was limited, non-invasive measurements were correlated with invasive ICP. This method, once validated in a wider number of patients, could be used as a screening test when raised ICP is suspected.",

In this TBI subset more aggressive therapies, as profound hyperventilation, barbiturates, decompressive craniectomy, are currently used. HICP is frequent; 153 patients had at least 1 day of ICP [20 mmHg . Early surgery was necessary for 221 cases, and standard medical therapy [sedation, mannitol, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) withdrawal, PaCO 2 [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] was used in 135 patients. Reinforced treatment (PaCO 2 25-29 mmHg, induced arterial hypertension, muscle relaxants) was used in 179 cases (44%), and second-tier therapies in 80 (20%). Surgical decompression and/or barbiturates were used in 28 of 407 cases (7%). Six-month outcome was favorable (good recovery or moderate disability) in 195 cases (53%). HICP was associated with worse outcome. Outcome for cases who had received second-tier therapies was significantly worse (43% favorable at 6 months, P = 0.03). Therefore, HICP is frequent and is associated with worse outcome. The indications for surgical decompression and/or barbiturates seem restricted to less than 10% of severe TBI.",

During forced hyperventilation simultaneous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation was used in only 9%. Overall adherence to current guidelines seems common, but early prophylactic hyperventilation and the use of additional cerebral oxygenation monitoring during forced hyperventilation are not followed exposing the patient to potential iatrogenic complications.",

In all patients a microdialysis catheter was inserted. Cerebral low-glucose episodes and high-glucose episodes occurred independently of blood glucose levels. During high-glucose episodes cerebral microdialysate levels were normal, while cerebral low glucose, occurring more frequently in symptomatic patients, was associated with severe cellular distress, i.e., increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio, glutamate, glycerol and with unfavorable outcome. Cerebral low glucose was associated with severe metabolic distress and may present a target for therapy to improve clinical outcome.

The results suggest, in the absence of a control group, that the ratio increases after etomidate administration and is associated with a diminished rise in circulating cortisol upon ACTH.

However, they often clot prematurely which impairs azotemic control and has also effects on costs and nursing workload. Antithrombin (AT) deficiency has been associated with hemofilter thrombosis (HT) in patients with sepsis. Lanquetot et al. [28] investigated whether there was an association between AT level activity and HT occurrence during early continuous hemofiltration. They included 48 consecutive patients following cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects were grouped according to the appearance of one or more episodes of hemofilter thrombosis. Morbidity and mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. The authors found initial AT activity to be low in both groups. On the following days AT activity was lower in the HT group but was not found to be a predictor of HT in multivariate analysis. The authors concluded that the potential interest of monitoring AT levels to adapt anticoagulant strategy needs to be analyzed in larger series of patients.",

[29] reported in a prospective observational study that early tight glucose control, within 48 h from ICU admission, was associated with a better outcome in terms of mortality, ventilator free days, and length of stay. Also after the use of stepwise regression analysis, the differences between the two groups remained associated with the timing of the tight glucose control. The result calls for a prospective randomized trial to address the timing of tight glucose control. Two studies report of the advantages of a computerized algorithm to facilitate and to increase success rate of tight glucose control. Pachler et al. [30] evaluated their algorithm in a small randomized study. They found a mean blood glucose value within the target range and a lower hyperglycemic index in the group using a computerized algorithm, but also a shorter sampling interval. Safety was evaluated by hypoglycemia, which was inconclusive, with overall only one hypoglycemic event in the 25 ? 25 patients. In a questionnaire, nurses were in favor of the computerized algorithm. Vogelzang et al. [31] report from a large observational study that the hypoglycemia rate was low (0.85%) and that target level was reached faster and with fewer samples when the computerized algorithm was used. Lapichino et al. [32] investigated if tight glucose control affected NO-metabolism as reflected by the circulating levels of asymmetricdimethylarginine. In a prospective study of 72 patients in septic shock they found no difference attributable to tight glucose control in clinical outcome parameters or in asymmetric-dimethylarginine. Mean blood glucose were 110 versus 163 mg/dl, respectively, in the two groups.",

The authors used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 h of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7-10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filling pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure [ or =65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7-9 g/dl (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive endexpiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose \\150 mg/dl after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B). The authors concluded that evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",

The investigators demonstrated that circulating osteopontin could be used as a marker of IL-6 release and of sepsis (vs. SIRS), even though the levels were elevated in SIRS (vs. control) as well. Osteopontin appeared capable of increasing IL-6 secretion by macrophages in vitro. It is unclear how specific the findings were for microbial infection, however. Dulhunty et al. [43] reported on a multi-center study (n = 3,543 patients) done in Australia and New Zealand to answer the question whether severe non-infectious SIRS differs from severe sepsis in the ICU, regarding epidemiological issues. Even though mortality rates were similar, severe non-septic SIRS was more common and more often associated with neurological abnormalities and causes of death, than severe sepsis.

In multivariate logistic regression models of predictors of death including age, sex, APACHE II, and blood creatinine, MR-proANP levels on the day of diagnosis of VAP and on day 4 turned out to be the only parameters that remained as independent predictors.",

This hypothesis was confirmed in a small pilot study performed by Berbee et al. [50] . Upon hospitalization, apoCI levels were approximately 5 times lower than normal values in 16 septic patients.

The first was, what is the current probability that activated protein C is not better than the control? and, if the current probability is not small, then the second question was, how many patients will be needed for the activated protein C confirmatory trial? To give an adequate response to these questions, the authors used a Bayesian statistical approach. The P value commonly used in frequentist statistical methods only tell us how likely we will observe the reported data when the null hypothesis is true, but does not tell us the actual probability of treatment effect. Bayesian methodology, however, can provide this actual (or current) probability. To do this, all available data is selected for the prior probability. The prior distributions were defined as severe skeptic, moderate skeptic, mild skeptic and enthusiastic. The authors found that, except for the enthusiastic analysis, the current probabilities that activated protein C is not better than the control are not small (range, 0.14-0.48). The number of patients needed for a confirmatory trial ranged between 0 and 8,350. The authors concluded that a confirmatory trial with about 600 patients with severe sepsis and high risk of death can provide a convincing answer for moderate and mild skeptic physicians regarding the efficacy of the drug.",

Almost 2,200 patients hospitalized for more than 2 days during a 2-year observation period were studied: 845 did not acquire IAI, 306 of whom had infection on admission (IOA); 346 did acquire IAI, 125 of whom had IOA.

However, the systemic use of this antibiotic class is limited by its toxicity and poor penetration into the lung. Aerosol administration offers the theoretical advantage of achieving high antibiotic concentrations at the infection site and low systemic absorption, thereby avoiding renal toxicity. However, some uncertainties persist regarding the real usefulness of such a mode of administration, since during mechanical ventilation (MV), high amounts of the particles dispersed by conventional nebulizers remain in the ventilatory circuits and the tracheobronchial tree before reaching the distal lung. In a study carried out in subjects with healthy lungs, Ehrmann et al. [73] showed that, using an optimized nebulization technique with a vertical spacer placed underneath a vibrating mesh nebulizer, doses of 60 mg/kg amikacin were associated with serum concentrations equal to or less than those obtained after intravenous infusion of 15 mg/kg amikacin. Because amikacin systemic pharmacokinetics reflect deposition of the nebulized drug in the distal pulmonary parenchyma, these data strongly support the hypothesis that optimized nebulization of antimicrobial agents may permit to obtain very high lung parenchyma concentrations during a sufficiently long period of time for achieving bactericidal activity.",

One of the major predisposing factors is insufficient target-site concentration of antibiotics used for prophylaxis. Because ventilation/perfusion mismatch due to atelectasis may also influence antibiotic distribution to lung tissue, hence increasing the risk of post-operative pneumonia, Hutschala et al. compared the penetration of levofloxacin into the lung of two groups of patients, using microdialysis probes to sequentially determine in vivo lung tissue levels. The first group consisted of five patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (atelectasis model), and the second one, of five patients operated with the offpump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB)-technique [74] . In the OPCAB-group, the median of the maximum concentration of levofloxacin in lung tissue was significantly higher compared with the CPB-group, establishing that atelectasis formations lead to critically lower lung tissue concentrations of levofloxacin in nondependent parts of lung tissue. Such data emphasizes the necessity of direct interstitial antibiotic measurement to re-evaluate commonly accepted prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotic dosages in various clinical settings and pulmonary diseases associated with the formation of atelectasis.",

In patients at risk for infection with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens, the clinician has to resort to broad-spectrum antimicrobials, which are themselves linked with the emergence of multi-drug resistance. The potential value of systematic endotracheal tracheal surveillance cultures as a tool to predict involvement of MDR microorganisms in VAP was studied by two independent groups of investigators [75, 76] Bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract frequently persists, even when a patient receives antimicrobial treatment, and even though the colonizing bacteria are, in vitro, susceptible to the antibiotics. To test the hypothesis that antibiotics with presumed efficacy, based on in vitro susceptibility testing, reduce the likelihood of persistence of respiratory tract colonization, compared to antibiotics presumed to be ineffective or when no antibiotics were administered at all, Visscher et al. [78] analyzed endotracheal aspirate cultures performed during ICU stay in a large cohort of 715 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Systemic antibiotics were administered on 7,102 (61%) of patient days. Antibiotic use was associated with non-persistence for all pathogens, except Acinetobacter species and P. aeruginosa. Relative risks for non-persistence (as compared to ineffective or no antibiotics) ranged from 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.6) for H. influenzae to 0.5 (0.3-1.0) for Acinetobacter species. Pathogen-specific characteristics, such as the ability of biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa, or patient-specific characteristics, such as the severity of underlying disease or immune paralysis, could both be involved, but further studies are needed to elucidate this matter.",

In patients with complicated and critical conditions, such as those admitted to ICU, the clinical significance of NTM in respiratory specimens and the prognostic impact of NTM pulmonary infection are even more difficult to understand than in stable patients. Therefore, Shu et al. conducted a retrospective study including all medical ICU patients with NTM being isolated from respiratory specimens within a period of 8.5 years to evaluate the clinical significance of the presence of NTM and compare the demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, and outcome in patients with NTM pulmonary infection with those with NTM colonization and control subjects whose respiratory samples were culture-negative for mycobacteria [79] . Among the 5,378 patients admitted to medical ICUs, NTM were isolated from 169 (5.8%) patients. Of them, 47 (28%) were considered NTM pulmonary infection. Within 100 days after ICU admission, significantly more patients with NTM infection died than those with NTM colonization and control subjects (47 vs. 8 vs. 14%, P \\ 0.001). Therefore, keeping a high suspicion when NTM is isolated and using careful consideration when starting anti-NTM treatment should be emphasized.",

In an attempt to raise diagnostic accuracy, Luyt et al. [80] assesses the predictive capacity for the diagnosis of VAP of serum procalcitonin levels before and on the day it is suspected. Among the 73 suspected episodes VAP was confirmed by quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage cultures in 32 and refuted in 41. On day 1 a 0.5 ng/ml procalcitonin threshold had 72% sensitivity but only 24% specificity for diagnosing VAP. Between ''before'' and day 1, procalcitonin increased in 41 and 15% of patients with and without VAP, respectively. Thus, crude values and procalcitonin rise had poor diagnostic value for VAP in this particular setting and should not be used to initiate antibiotics when VAP is clinically suspected.",

However, it is commonly assumed that prior antimicrobial therapy can dramatically decrease its sensitivity. In order to re-assess the influence of antibiotics on the value of various BAL cytological parameters in diagnosing VAP, Linssen et al. [82] studied 335 episodes of clinically suspected VAP in 282 patients. There was no difference in areas under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic curves between patients with and without antibiotic therapy for any parameter studied. The most prominent AUCs were: total cell count, 0.65; percentage polymorphonuclear neutrophils, 0.71; and percentage infected cells, 0.90. Based on these data, it appears that the percentage of infected cells in BALF can be reliably used for diagnosing VAP in patients receiving antibiotic therapy, provided that the introduction of the new antibiotics was recent (less than 72 h). Prevention VAP remains a major problem in intensive care units and effective preventive measures are eagerly searched for. The presence of an endotracheal tube (ETT) not only compromises the natural barrier between the oropharynx and trachea, but also provides a protected environment for pathogens since a biofilm develops on its inner and outer surfaces. In an attempt to prevent bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract in patients requiring mechanical ventilation, Berra et al. [83] developed a polyurethane ETT coated with silver sulfadiazine. In a second study, the same group of investigators randomized 46 adult patients to be intubated with a standard non-coated ETT, or with a silver sulfadiazine-coated ETT [84] . Coating with silver sulfadiazine prevented bacterial colonization of the ETT and was associated with a thinner mucus layer. Although preliminary, these data support the hypothesis that an endotracheal tube coated externally and internally with a potent antiseptic product such as silver could exert a sustained antimicrobial effect within the proximal airways and block biofilm formation at its surface.",

In the first study, Depuydt et al. were able to document that a 3-weekly tracheal aspirate protocol in intubated patients had a sensitivity to predict MDR pathogens of 69% with a specificity of 96%. Appropriate antibiotic coverage within 24 and 48 h following MDR VAP was 77 and 89%, respectively. A carbapenem-based empirical scheme would have been equally appropriate (83 vs. 77% at 24 h; 83 vs. 89% at 48 h), but a beta-lactam-fluoroquinolone empirical therapy would have been less (59 vs. 77% at 24 h; 59 vs. 89% at 48 h) as would have been beta-lactam-aminoglycoside therapy (68 vs. 77% at 24 h; 68 vs. 89% at 48 h). Very similar results were obtained by Papadomichelakis et al. in a retrospective cohort study of patients who had developed VAP or bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by a MDR pathogen, and in whom tracheal aspirates were obtained twice weekly and rectal swabs once weekly. Knowledge of previous colonization improved the rate of adequate empiric antimicrobial treatment (91 vs. 40% in VAP and 86 vs. 50% in BSI cases, P \\ 0.05), confirming that colonization surveillance for resistant gram-negative microorganisms is predictive of subsequent infection etiology and can improve empiric antimicrobial treatment adequacy in a critical care setting.International guidelines recommend screening patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on admission, although consensus on sites required for optimum detection has not been reached. To determine whether throat and rectal swabs identified a significant number of additional MRSA-colonized patients not captured by swabbing at keratinized skin carriage sites (anterior nares, perineum and axillae), Batra et al.[77] evaluated 1,470 consecutive ICU patients. One hundred and five (7%) patients were admitted with MRSA, of which only 63 (60%) were detected by a pooled keratinized skin swab. A further 36 (34%) patients were detected only by throat or rectal swabs. Indeed, throat and rectal swabs combined had a higher sensitivity than pooled keratinised skin swabs (76 vs. 60% P = 0.03). Thus, a complete identification of patients colonized by MRSA may need sampling of the throat and rectum, and not only the anterior nares, axillae, and peritoneum.",
