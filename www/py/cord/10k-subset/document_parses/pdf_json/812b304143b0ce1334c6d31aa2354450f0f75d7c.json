The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 2 . This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease 3 . This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptorbinding specificity for human-like a2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 164, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 364, "end": 365, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 507, "end": 508, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infections in humans have been reported in eight contiguous provinces in eastern China (Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong and Zhejiang), two municipalities (Beijing and Shanghai) and Taiwan to date 4 .

Unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses, which exhibit lethality in poultry and cause severe human disease, low pathogenic (LPAI) H7N9 viruses seem to be asymptomatic or cause mild disease in poultry and wild bird populations, possibly due to the presence of a single amino acid in the haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of this virus 2, 5 . Similar to H5N1 viruses, human cases with H7N9 virus seem to result from direct contact with infected poultry, yet .20% of confirmed H7N9 cases have reported no exposure to live animals 6 . Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not been observed with this virus to date, reports of family clusters of A(H7N9) infection suggest the potential for virus spread between close contacts 6 . Understanding the properties of A(H7N9) viruses which contribute to human disease and their capacity for human-to-human transmission is a critical requirement for guidance of public health responses.

Virus was added to cells apically in serum-free medium at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for one hour before washing. Plates were incubated at either 37 uC or 33 uC for the duration of the experiment as indicated. Aliquots of culture supernatant taken p.i. were immediately frozen at 280 uC until titration. All samples collected for replication kinetics were titrated for the presence of infectious virus by standard plaque assay in MDCK cells. Serology. HI assays were performed with ferret sera collected 16-20 days after inoculation or exposure to infected animals using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes against homologous virus 28 . Cytokine and chemokine quantification. Clarified mouse lung tissue homogenates were analysed with the BioPlex protein array system (Bio-Rad), according to manufacturer's instructions. A minimum of three independent samples were collected and tested in duplicate for each condition. Glycan microarray analysis. Microarray printing and influenza virus analyses have been described previously 11 . A/Anhui/1/2013 virus was analysed at a HA titre of 512 while A/Shanghai/1/2013 was analysed at an HA titre of 256. Specific details on the glycans analysed in these studies are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . Statistics. Statistical significance (P , 0.05) for murine and ferret studies was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni posttest. Statistical significance for in vitro studies was determined using the Mann-Whitney and Student's t tests. All in vitro studies were conducted with sufficient sample size for statistical analyses performed; indicated tests were chosen as appropriate for each data set to be analysed and all data meet the assumptions of the tests.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 258, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 580, "end": 582, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1377, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1772, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1964, "end": 1985, "text": "Supplementary Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "METHODS SUMMARY"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "WHO.
