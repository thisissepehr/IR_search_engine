We plotted the weekly acute respiratory disease (ARD) counts and influenza epidemics against AMI and chronic IHD deaths. There were 11 892 subjects dying of AMI and 23 000 subjects dying of chronic IHD. Median age was 75 for women and 65 for men. In every year, a peak of AMI and chronic IHD deaths were present and coincided with the influenza epidemic and peak ARD activity. A similar pattern was seen for each subgroup of men, women, subjects 50 years or older, and subjects 70 years or older. When comparing the average influenza epidemic weeks to average off-season weeks, the odds for AMI and chronic IHD death increased by 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.56) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97-1.26), respectively. Conclusion Influenza epidemics are associated with a rise in autopsy-confirmed coronary deaths. Influenza vaccination should be advocated for patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] From our own observational study, and a closer examination of published trials, we estimated that influenza causes up to 92 000 deaths per year in US only through triggering of fatal myocardial infarctions. 3 The influenza attack rate in a typical year is 10-20% and, given the high burden of symptomatic and asymptomatic coronary artery disease, many of these cases occur in subjects with coronary heart disease (CHD). 9 This attack rate (and in many cases, the severity of the subsequent disease) will be even higher during epidemics and pandemics. Accordingly, it has been noted that during influenza epidemics and pandemics (except for 1918 Spanish flu pandemic), roughly twice as many subjects die of cardiac causes rather than from influenza pneumonia. 10 Here, we report our investigation of the impact of influenza epidemics on CHD deaths in St Petersburg, Russia, over a span of 8 years. Unlike the previous studies which relied mainly on death certificates, we selected fatal cases with autopsy-proven CHD as the cause of death. Moreover, by studying a population in which at the time of study only a minority were receiving influenza vaccine and statin drugs, we were able to study the natural history.",

In our cross-correlation analysis, for any peak ARD activity, we found peak coronary event correlations at near time zero, within an approximately 2 week peak window on either side. The correlation between ARD and CHD death decreased steadily to zero in about 10 weeks. Therefore, while in clinical studies influenza activity precedes AMI by about a week, in population studies, they may be coincident in time or the relation may even reverse (raising the question of whether AMI patients become more susceptible to influenza, or whether there is a common trigger such as cold, stress, crowding, or pollution); however, these two activities are almost always seen in a slim (1-2 weeks) window of time. The major source for the variation of the relation in large population studies seems to be the variances in reporting methods. These include delays in reporting culture data or death certificates and other variations in the sources of data which are even more different among countries.",

            "text": "Our study, unlike the previous ones, relied on autopsy data; this minimizes bias due to misclassification of the disease. We selected St Petersburg, Russia, because of its very high autopsy rate (close to 70%) and the low rate of vaccine use at the time of study (,3%). Low use of influenza vaccine and statins (,3%) at the time of our study minimizes the potential therapeutic biases and makes our study closer to a natural history. In contrast, these biases would be much more common in studies conducted in the past 5-10 years in the US where a substantial portion of the population at risk would have been receiving influenza vaccine and several cardioprotective drugs; unless one focuses on the less-treated groups (the poor, urban, and minorities). Our study had several limitations. We did not have access to person-specific data on medications, risk factors, or autopsy diagnoses of pneumonia-influenza. We did not have the meteorological data to assess their impact on influenza activity and cardiac mortality and it was out of the scope of this study. However, other groups have shown that even after considering all such parameters, influenza remains a major determinant of winter excess mortality. 27 ",

In the majority of influenza epidemics and pandemics (except for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic), cardiovascular death surpassed other causes of mortality, including superimposed pneumonia. 21 During influenza pandemics, patients with CHD may be considered among the priority groups for receipt of vaccine. Meticulous use of plaque-stabilizing agents such as statins, beta-blockers, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should offer additional protection during an influenza outbreak. 21 Also, a substantial number of myocardial infarctions (especially in women) present with atypical symptoms and the diagnosis can easily be missed in the setting of acute influenza and pneumonia. For example, one case series report of SARS patients showed that 40% of victims in that study died of AMI. 31 ",

            "text": "Influenza epidemics are associated with increases in cardiac death due to CHD. Recognition of influenza as a trigger for acute coronary events calls for more intensive efforts to increase the vaccination rate in subjects at risk of CHD. This may be especially important in an influenza pandemic when a high mortality may be observed in the elderly and those affected with CHD or multiple coronary risk factors. 10 Vigorous use of cardioprotective medications such as statins during pandemics may prevent many deaths, as CHD is the major cause of death in a substantial proportion of influenza victims. The role of influenza in cardiovascular disease is neglected in the cardiology textbooks and the mainstream literature. A search in PubMed with keywords of influenza and myocardial infarction at the time of preparing this manuscript yielded only a small number of papers while there were thousands of papers on traditional CHD risk factors. The benefit of influenza vaccination for cardiovascular patients was recently recognized by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology. 32 We suggest that, based on the available data, the European Society of Cardiology adopts a similar policy and recommends influenza vaccine for European patients with CHD. The vaccine may be even more beneficial for the underprivileged subjects who are not taking all the recommended cardioprotective medications due to their high cost (unlike influenza vaccine) or lack of access to proper medical care.",
