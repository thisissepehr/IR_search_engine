            "text": "Segmental genomes (i.e., genomes in which the genetic information is dispersed between two or more discrete molecules) are abundant in RNA viruses, but virtually absent in DNA viruses. It has been suggested that the division of information in RNA viruses expands the pool of variation available to natural selection by providing for the reassortment of modular RNAs from different genetic sources. This explanation is based on the apparent inability of related RNA molecules to undergo the kinds of physical recombination that generate variation among related DNA molecules. In this paper we propose a radically different hypothesis. Self-replicating RNA genomes have an error rate of about 10-3-10 -4 substitutions per base per generation, whereas for DNA genomes the corresponding figure is 10-9-10 -11. Thus the level of noise in the RNA copier process is five to eight orders of magnitude higher than that in the DNA process. Since a small module of information has a higher chance of passing undamaged through a noisy channel than does a large one, the division of RNA viral information among separate small units increases its overall chances of survival. The selective advantage ofgenome segmentation is most easily modelled for modular RNAs wrapped up in separate viral coats. If modular RNAs are brought together in a common viral coat, segmentation is advantageous only when interactions among the modular RNAs are selective enough to provide some degree of discrimination against miscopied sequences. This requirement is most clearly met by the reoviruses.",

            "text": "Divided genomes, in which the genetic information is dispersed among two or more physically separate molecules, occur in over 17 groups of RNA viruses (Matthews 1979) . By contrast, only one group of DNA viruses appears to have a divided genome structure (Haber et al. 1981) . Perhaps the most popular explanation for the existence of divided genomes is that they allow modular RNAs from related but different clones to exchange sequences by reassortment (Jaspers 1974; Joklik 1974; Nahmias and Reanney 1977; Reijnders 1978; Lane 1979) . According to this view divided genomes have been selected for during evolution because they expand the pool of variation in interbreeding populations. The expanded variation model is widely favoured because reassortment has been documented convincingly in many groups of viruses with divided genomes, e.g., the influenza group (Webster and Granoff 1974; Palese and Young 1982) , the reoviruses (Ahmed and Fields 1981; Joklik 1981) and the rotaviruses (Greenberg et al. 1982) . Mixed infection experiments also support the concept that related viruses can exchange RNA segments: The RNA-3 of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus can substitute for the RNA-3 ofbrome mosaic virus (Bancroft 1972) , and the Q strain of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and the V strain of tomato aspermy virus (TAV) form a vigorous hybrid that contains RNA-3 of CMV and RNA-1 and RNA-2 of TAV (Habili and Francki 1974) .",

For one thing this explanation is strongly 'group selectionist', and the group-selection argument is now invoked only as a last resort by biologists (see Maynard-Smith 1978; Rose and Doolittle 1983) . Perhaps more to the point, the rate of mutation in RNA viruses such as the Qf3 is so high that each viable viral genome in a clonally derived population differs from the 'average' sequence of the parental population in one or two positions (Domingo et al. 1978 ). This appears to be true of all RNA viruses (Holland et al. 1982; Reanney 1984) . Thus the identity of any RNA virus genome in nature is only maintained because selection continually removes the unacceptable variants that are continually generated by the error-prone copier mechanism. In a situation in which the pool of preexisting genetic variation is so high that 'only 14% of the population consists of\"wild-type\" phage' (i.e., virus) (Domingo et al. 1978 ) the need for additional variation to be generated by reassortment is not obvious. Other explanations may therefore be sought.",

By contrast, RNA molecules replicate asymmetrically from single strands even if the copying process uses a double-helical template (as in reoviruses).

This is because known error-correcting mechanisms always use the information specified by one intact strand of a duplex molecule to guide restorative processes on the damaged complementary strand (see Loeb and Kunkel 1982) . Because RNA lacks the editing and proofreading functions of DNA, the frequency of mutation in RNA copier systems is between 100,000 and 100,000,000 times greater than that in DNA copier systems (see Kornberg 1980; Holland et al. 1982) .",

However, measurements of mutation frequency are of dubious value unless the temperature at which replication occurs is taken into account, since error rates in RNA replication increase with temperature (Reanney and Pressing 1983) . In the absence of repair, errors will accumulate in the genome. An RNA virus that replicates at 37~ may thus transmit considerably more errors to its progeny than one that replicates at 15~ Nondividing RNA molecules also can accumulate errors from a variety of sources. Physical agents may damage RNA by deaminating cytosine to uracil (heat) or inducing pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine dimers (ultraviolet radiation), while a chemical agent such as hydrogen peroxide may generate a variety of changes due to its oxidative capacity. Since these premutational lesions cannot be repaired in an RNA system, they may cause a significant, long-term deterioration in the quality of the genetic information encoded in RNA molecules.

Second, the expression for K may be shown to achieve its maximum value when both numbers and sizes of modules are equally distributed. This is shown mathematically in Appendix 1. The prediction of equal size distribution is well supported by existing data on multicompartment viruses (Table 1) , considering that other biochemical factors are bound to influence the distribution to some degree.

Point (a) is certainly true of natural viruses and point (b) is probably true of viruses that have insect vectors or that infect hosts (e.g. plants) that are grouped closely together in a common habitat (Nahmias and Reanney 1977) . However, this kind of arrangement has the disadvantage that two or more particles must jointly infect a common cell if infection is to be successful. This limits the number of modular RNAs to two or three (Table 1 and Fig. 2 ). The sizes of the modular RNAs are also curtailed by this requirement, as the chances of successful coinfection are proportional to the number of available progeny viruses, which is in turn a function of genome lengths (the smaller the composite genome, the larger the number of RNAs that can be generated from a fixed pool of precursor elements). Thus, it is not surprising that multicompartment viruses in general have relatively small aggregate genome sizes. The problems associated with a multihit infection process may also explain why many RNA viruses have not adopted the divided genome strategy.",

Jaspers (1974) has suggested that the replicative strategies of most groups of RNA viruses can be rationalised by assuming that they represent attempts to accommodate polycistronic RNAs to a biochemical environment tailored to process only monocistronic mRNAs (for a discussion see Reanney 1982) . On this basis segmentation has the striking advantage that it divides RNA viral information into small units that closely resemble cellular mRNAs. There is no doubt, in our view, that this argument is correct, as far as it goes. However, it cannot be put forward as a general or unitary explanation of the divided genome phenomenon because other strategies open to and adopted by RNA viruses also enable RNA genomes to survive in na-144 ture. Thus, some RNA viruses, e.g., the polio group, overcome the problem of translation by translating their polycistronic genomes into long polyproteins which are then cleaved into specific, functional peptides. Other viruses, e.g., the influenza group, generate monocistronic RNAs by transcription from continuous, negative-strand genomes using discrete initiation and termination signals. Yet another mechanism has been adopted by the coronaviruses, and so on (for a discussion of these various points, see Reanney 1982) .",

In the context of a bacterial cell the segmental RNA genomes of the eystoviruses (see Matthews 1979 ) seem very much out of place, suggesting that, at least in this instance, a different explanation of the divided genome phenomenon must be sought.",

Although factors such as the need to adapt eukaryotic RNA viral genomes to the unit-message character of higher cells may have played a part in the tendency of RNA genomes to split into separate modules, any explanation that does not recognise the critical importance of genetic noise for the divided genome phenomenon is at best only a partial answer, and at worst, a misleading one. We suggest that the current theories be revised to accommodate the model presented in this paper. so that the activation energy for this reaction is E + mst, where ms is the mean number of errors in B*. The reaction constant for this second reaction is then Ce-~ + mrS, r, which by comparison with Eq. (lb) yields O.I~ = e mt'~T (4) and similarly for o.^.",

This gives a rather complex set of relations between the Li, Ni and q. An additional set may be obtained by setting ~K = 0 for variations in the N~. However, the biology of the situation allows an appropriate simplification. Any real virus system must cope with a range of values of q, since daily or seasonal temperature changes may affect q considerably, as may factors such as changing levels of ultraviolet radiation. The most generally valid solution to Eq. (4) will then be one that treats q as an independent variable and sets all individual coefficients ofq t, identically equal to zero, since the q~ are independent functions (unless the L~ are equal, which then gives our final result immediately).The only terms of the form qt, for i r j,k come from the righthand side of Eq. (4), and their coefficients can only be zero if Nj = Nk, i.e., Ni = N/n for all i. In this case all ~,i are equal, and there is no solution for the coefficients of qt~ and qt, unless Lj L, = L/n, as the reader may readily verify. (1 d) dt where k is the basic reaction constant and the as indicate mean reductions of reaction rate for copies with errors. We have assumed second-order kinetics.In addition, there are four equations of material conservation: It is possible to provide a straightforward interpretation of the as as follows. The rate constant k of Eq. (l a) may be assumed to follow an Arrhenius-type equation k = Ce -~T(3) where C is a constant and E is the activation energy of the reaction A + B ~ AB. Consider now the reaction A + B* ~ AB*. Let the presence of each error in B* increase the activation energy by ~,",
