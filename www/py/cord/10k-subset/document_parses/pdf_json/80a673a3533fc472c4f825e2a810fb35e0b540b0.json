            "text": "Aims: The chronic consumption of alcohol is known to result in neurodegeneration and impairment of cognitive function. Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. Methods: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks coexposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. Results: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. Conclusion: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.",

A considerable amount of research demonstrates that alcohol has a degenerative effect on the brain with chronic consumption ultimately leading to alcoholrelated brain damage (ARBD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive function including decreased working memory and problem solving ability (Brust, 2010) . Early pathological studies of alcoholics found that brain volume reduction was largely due to loss of white matter (WM) (Sutherland et al., 2014; Harper and Kril, 1985; De la Monte, 1988) . Neurodegenerative effects are also seen but, in alcoholics without concomitant thiamine deficiency, these tend to be restricted to the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997) . These findings have been confirmed by neuroimaging studies with the changes being, at least partially, reversible with abstinence (Buhler and Mann, 2011; Pfefferbaum et al., 2014) .",

However, unlike ARBD, there is no consensus on the effects on brain atrophy with previous studies reporting increased temporal (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) and cingulate WM volumes (Yu et al., 2011) , or no significant change in WM volume (Durazzo et al., 2007; Gallinat et al., 2006; Paul, 2008 #7360) . However, decreased WM integrity has been consistently reported (Paul et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011) . Furthermore, it is unclear what component(s) of tobacco smoke might be responsible. There are more than 4000 toxic compounds in tobacco smoke including carbon monoxide, aldehydes and dihydroxybenzenes. There are also several kinds of tobacco specific nitrosamines, of which 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3pyridyl)-1-butanone (also known as nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK)) is the most studied. Most studies have focused on NNK's carcinogenic effects but sub-mutagenic doses (2 mg/kg), that are known to be hepatotoxic (Zabala et al., 2015) , may also have neurodegenerative effects, as seen with other nitrosamines such as streptozotocin (Lester-Coll et al., 2006) .",

De La Monte and colleagues have developed a rat model of chronic/binge alcohol and NNK consumption (Zabala et al., 2015) . They have recently used this model to show that oligodendroglial gene and protein expression is perturbed by coexposure and that this likely leads to impaired myelin synthesis (Tong et al., 2015b) . Here, we extend this work by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate whether myelin ultrastructure is affected in these rats and the relative effects of alcohol versus NNK.",

To ensure equivalent caloric intake, the volumes of liquid diet supplied were balanced based on inter-group differences in the amounts consumed, although both groups consumed all of the food supplied each day. From Week 3 until Week 8, rats in each group (n = 9 or 10) were administered intraperitoneal NNK (2 mg/kg) or saline on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. In Weeks 7 and 8, ethanol-treated rats were binged with 2 g/kg ethanol (100 \u00b5l, intraperitoneal) on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays or saline for the controls. Binge administration of ethanol increased the blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) by 2-to 4-fold (mean 70 mg dl \u22121 chronic to 240, albeit this was slightly lower with NNK + ethanol treatment (200 mg dl \u22121 ) (Zabala et al., 2015) ). The rats were euthanized with isofluorane and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Their frontal lobes were dissected out and a representative WM tissue block removed and fixed by immersion in modified Karnovsky's fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for TEM. Tissue samples were washed and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ), dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin for sectioning. Three ultrathin sections (70 nm) were obtained from each block and placed on copper mesh grids. Sections were subsequently stained with dilute uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All sections were examined on a JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at 120 kV at Sydney Microscopy and Microanalysis, University of Sydney. All TEM images were captured using a highresolution Gatan digital CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, United States) and imported into open source GIMP (version 2.9.1, www.gimp.org) for adjustment of contrast and Image J (version 150b, wsr@nih.gov) for quantitation. TEM images were obtained in a random but systematic fashion.

In this model, BAC increased 4-fold from a mean of 70-240 mg dl \u22121 following binge doses, although maximum BAC was slightly lower with combined NNK treatment (200 mg dl \u22121 ) (Zabala et al., 2015) .

Notwithstanding there was less sampling of unmyelinated fibres in the study, it does appear that ethanol, but not NNK, is directly neurotoxic. These results are consistent with the widespread WM loss seen in ARBD (de la Monte, 1988; Kril et al., 1997; Sutherland et al., 2014) . In the absence of TEM studies on ARBD the effect of ethanol on unmyelinated fibres appears consistent with the moderate but localized GM atrophy and neuronal loss seen in areas such as the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997) .",

A MRI study by Gazdzinski et al. (2005) found significant GM losses in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes in alcoholics (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) . When this group re-analysed their results they found that these reductions were largely found in smoking alcoholics compared rather than non-smoking alcoholics (Durazzo et al., 2007) . These findings, along with greater WM loss also in smoking alcoholics, have since been replicated (Luhar et al., 2013; Durazzo et al., 2014) . In terms of a sparing effect of smoking on neuronal damage, our own work using autopsy tissue suggested trends towards increased volume in smokers in two GM regions (the supramarginal and sensory cortex) but there was no correlation to smoking pack-years (McCorkindale et al., 2016) .",

Tong et al. did observe a greater effect of ethanol on myelin sheath thickness than observed here. They also showed that the combined exposures decreased the expression proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, proteolipid protein 1 and myelin basic protein in mature oligodendrocytes. Whereas there was increased expression of immature oligodendroglial genes such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide. Interestingly, ethanol blocked these inhibitory effects.

There were interactions between alcohol and thiamine deficiency but the latter was largely responsible for WM damage seen. He et al. suggested that a selective loss or shrinkage of large fibres was responsible for the increase in myelinated fibre density. The more subtle alcohol effects reported by He et al. may reflect the chronic, intermittent exposure over 12 months, the strain and the age of the rats. Interestingly, a previous TEM study in human postmortem tissue of chronic alcoholics also failed to show a difference in WM volume or myelinated fibre diameter (Tang et al., 2004) . However, Tang et al. did note a non-significant reduction (9%) subcortical WM in alcoholics, similar to the 11% reduction in total WM seen in a previous volumetric study by their group (Jensen and Pakkenberg, 1993) and the 12% reduction in total WM reported recently by our group (McCorkindale et al., 2016) .",
