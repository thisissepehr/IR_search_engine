However, this has not been established in individuals who are infected with HIV-1. Here, we document increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8 + T cell responses in the peripheral blood of all nine study participants who were infected with HIV-1 with suppressed blood viremia, while receiving bNAb therapy during ART interruption 4 . Increased CD4 + T cell responses were detected in eight individuals. The increased T cell responses were due both to newly detectable reactivity to HIV-1 Gag epitopes and the expansion of pre-existing measurable responses. These data demonstrate that bNAb therapy during ART interruption is associated with enhanced HIV-1-specific T cell responses. Whether these augmented T cell responses can contribute to bNAb-mediated viral control remains to be determined.",

Nevertheless, enhanced CD8 + and/or CD4 + T cell responses to these HIV-1 proteins were noted in several individuals at week 12 compared to week \u22122, including against gp120 and gp41 (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) . Specifically, the two individuals with controlled viremia beyond 30 weeks showed increased CD8 + and CD4 + responses to nearly all HIV-1 antigens tested at week 12 (Extended Data Fig. 7a -c, participants 9254 and 9255). This was not seen in individuals who rebounded before week 26 after ATI (Extended Data Fig. 7a -c, participants 9241, 9242, 9243, 9244, 9246, 9247 and 9252). However, the association between prolonged control and breadth in these two individuals is anecdotal. Larger studies will be required to understand the precise relationship between prolonged control, bNAb therapy and enhanced breadth of T cell immunity.",

IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses were detectable for six study participants ( Fig. 4a- Fig. 8f ). Overall, 41% (9 of 22) of the detectable responses in these six individuals at week 12 were directed against Gag epitopes that did not induce a detectable response at baseline (new responses: red dots and section, Fig. 4e ,f). In contrast, none of the Gag responses detected at baseline were lost by week 12. Finally, several individuals with detectable responses at week 12 had IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses against the major homology region (peptide 69-76, Gag285-304; Fig. 4g ), a highly conserved motif in the gag gene of all retroviruses 21 .

The increased T cell responses in individual 9245 are consistent with these observations (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). In contrast, our results demonstrate increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cell immunity in bNAb + ATI individuals at a time when bNAbs maintained viral suppression. At least two mechanisms could account for the association of bNAb treatment with increased T cell responses. One possibility is that ART interruption in the presence of antibodies results in production of bNAb-HIV-1 immune complexes that activate antigen-presenting dendritic cells and enhance their antigen-presenting and cross-presenting capabilities to produce a vaccinal effect 3, 26 . A second nonexclusive possibility is that the augmented CD8 + T cell response is driven by increased low-grade viral replication and antigen availability in tissues that we have not been able to assay during overt viremia suppression by bNAbs. While the underlying mechanism of the observed increased T cell immunity remains to be determined, a potentially important advantage of bNAb + ATI treatment compared to ATI alone, standard ART or T cell vaccination is that the immune system is stimulated with the individual's own virus while circulating viremia is suppressed. Whether the same effects will be seen in individuals who receive bNAbs during ART and whether the increased T cell responses are sufficient to help control infection remains to be determined.",

ART was interrupted at day 2 after the first antibody infusion 4 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02825797). Viral load was assessed every 1-2 weeks and ART was reinitiated when two consecutive measurements showed viral load of >200 copies per ml. All individuals were infected with clade B HIV-1 (ref. 4 Activation-induced marker assay. PBMCs were thawed, washed and cultured in 24-well plates at a concentration of 10 \u00d7 10 6 cells per ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with HEPES, penicillin and streptomycin and 10% human serum (Sigma).

Nine of the 15 study participants who fulfilled the study eligibility criteria harbored latent reservoir that was sensitive to both bNAbs (10-1074 and 3BNC117) and maintained viral suppression for 15 to >30 weeks after ART discontinuation. We analyzed all available study participants (n=9) with prolonged viral suppression for this manuscript.In addition, two study participants who harbored latent reservoir that was resistant to one of the two bNAbs and who rebounded early after ATI (week 5 or 7) were analyzed (Extended Data Figure 5 ).The number of individuals included in the historical comparison group of people on continuous ART (n=13) was chosen to approximately match the number of participants enrolled into the Phase Ib trial.Data exclusions No participant fulfilling the criteria mentioned above was excluded from the analyses.",
