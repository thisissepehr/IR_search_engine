We have previously show that the plant natural product (-)-hopeaphenol blocks the type iii secretion system (T3SS) in the Gram-negative pathogens Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (-)-Hopeaphenol is a resveratrol tetramer and in the present study we explore various resveratrol dimers, including partial structures of (-)-hopeaphenol, as T3SS inhibitors. To allow rapid and efficient assessment of T3SS inhibition in P. aeruginosa, we developed a new screening method by using a green fluorescent protein reporter under the control of the ExoS promoter. Using a panel of assays we showed that compounds with a benzofuran core structure i.e. viniferifuran, dehydroampelopsin B, anigopreissin A, dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin and resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid displayed significant to moderate activities towards the T3SS in Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In this study, we investigated the biological effects of selected natural benzofuran resveratrol dimers and analogues on the T3SS in comparison to (-)-hopeaphenol.

In addition, inhibition of bacterial growth was measured to allow identification of T3SS selective inhibitors with little or no effect on bacterial viability. The results are compiled in Table 1 . The direct half of (-)-hopeaphenol (1) i.e. ampelopsin A (2) and B (3) as well as dehydroampelopsin B (4) , which all contain a central 7-membered ring structure, showed no or modest inhibition of the T3SS. Similar data was obtained for the related opened form compounds \u03b5-viniferin (5) and \u03c9-viniferin (7) (IC 50 > 50 \u03bcM, yopE). The related benzofuran based viniferifuran (8) , on the other hand, showed good inhibition of the T3SS (Fig. 1) with an IC 50 of 10 \u03bcM (yopE) and 4 \u03bcM (YopH), without any effect on bacterial growth, i.e. the inhibition profile is similar to that of the original lead (-)-hopeaphenol. The fact that the inhibition profile of the resveratrol tetramer (-)-hopeaphenol is maintained by the resveratrol dimer viniferifuran is encouraging since it has a simplified structure that can be prepared in gram quantities in only four steps 11 . The resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid (10) that differs from viniferifuran in its hydroxylation pattern has a similar inhibition profile as viniferifuran in vitro. \u03b4-Viniferin (9) with the stilbene substitution at position 6 displayed a moderate activity (IC 50 = 29 \u03bcM, yopE) and the corresponding benzofuran analog dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin (10) was found to be equally potent as viniferifuran. Anigopreissin A (11) , with the stilbene group in position 7, inhibits the T3SS, but its detrimental effect on bacterial growth indicates that the inhibition is non-selective (Fig. S1 , Table 1 ).

A reporter-gene was constructed where the promoter of the P. aeruginosa T3S-toxin, ExoS, was transcriptionally fused to the GFP reporter gene. The gene construct was then cloned into the high copy plasmid pUCP18, together with orf1, coding the chaperon of ExoS 15 . To be able to select for the plasmid, the gene coding for gentamicin resistant was inserted into the plasmid, creating plasmid pCS500 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (Supporting information). The resulting plasmid was inserted into wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PAK and the T3SS activator mutant PAKexsA, resulting in strains that expresses the GFP when the ExoS promoter is activated. The T3SS is induced by incubating the bacteria in calcium depleted medium at 37 \u00b0C. The wild-type PAK and the PAKexsA strains with the reporter plasmid were grown under induced conditions and the compounds were added to the growth medium at different concentrations. After 16 h of incubation the GFP signal was measured in a plate reader (Biotek Synergy) and the inhibition of ExoS expression was calculated. The PAK(pCS500) control (no compound added) showed a high GFP level corresponding to a high expression of exoS, while the PAKexsA(pCS500) control strain showed a low level of GFP corresponding to a low level of exoS expression. The level of GFP seen by the PAKexsA(pCS500) strain was equal to a full inhibition of exoS by a fully active compound ( Figure S3 ).

Development of new antibiotics based on new synthetic scaffolds have proved to be challenging and this holds true also for identification of chemical entities that block virulence systems by mechanisms distinct from conventional antibiotics e.g. attenuation of T3SS in Gram-negative pathogens. A substantial number of synthetic T3SS inhibitors have been identified by predominantly phenotypic screening, and a selection of compounds have entered medicinal chemistry programs as summarized in recent review articles 18, 19 . Several studies indicate that natural sources also have the potential to provide T3SS inhibitors for further exploration. Screening of marine invertebrate extracts led to the identification of the glycolipid caminoside A as an inhibitor of T3SS in (8), dehydro-\u03b4-viniferin (10), anigopreissin A (11) and resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid (12) .

Recently it was reported that aurodox inhibited EPEC T3SS-mediated hemolysis and protected mice infected with a lethal dose of Citrobacter rodentium 24 . The mechanism for its T3SS inhibition has however not been established. Pseudoceramines A-D and spermatinamine produced by the marine sponge Pseudoceratina spp. were identified as putative inhibitors of T3SS in Y. pseudotuberculosis, but the compounds also exhibited a detrimental effect on bacterial growth, indicating general antibacterial properties 25 . Phenolic compounds involved in plant defense signaling have been reported to block the T3SS in P. aeruginosa via the GacS-GacA two-component signal transduction system 26 . Cytosporone B, a fungal metabolite, and analogues selectively block the secretion of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-associated effector proteins, without significant toxicity against bacteria 27 and similar effects have been reported for prenylated plant flavonoids, of which licoflavonol proved to be the most promising compound 28 . It was recently reported that the T3SS of Y. pseudotuberculosis is effectively blocked by piericidin A1, a metabolite produced by a marine actinobacterium 29 . The compound was identified by screening of a library composed of marine-derived extracts and its virulence blocking activity is not attributed to general toxicity towards the bacteria. Based on our finding that the plant derived complex resveratrol tetramer (-)-hopeaphenol (1) is an irreversible T3SS inhibitor we tested a series of resveratrol dimers that can be obtained by biomimetic or total synthesis. We identified the resveratrol dimer viniferifuran (8) and analogues as inhibitors of T3SS that target both Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa. Since we could observe inhibition of T3SS-toxins in both Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa it is not likely that the resveratrol dimers act on the toxins per se, since they are different between the bacterial species. The compounds rather act on a homologous function of the T3SS as the needle like structure or tip-proteins on the bacterial surface or some common regulatory system. Viniferifuran was found to irreversibly block the T3SS, indicating that (-)-hopeaphenol and viniferifuran might act by the same mechanism, although the chemical structures are substantially different.
