The grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, is one of the most devastating pests of cereals worldwide. In this study, we performed the transcriptome analysis of salivary glands of S. avenae. A total of 33,079 assembled unigenes were identified in the salivary glands of aphids. Of the all obtained unigenes, 15,833(47.86%) and 10,829(32.73%) unigenes showed high similarity to known proteins in Nr and Swiss-Prot databases respectively. 526 unigenes were predicted to encode secretory proteins, including some digestive and detoxifying enzymes and potential effectors. The RT-PCR and RT-qPCR results showed that all of the 15 most highly expressed putative secretory proteins specifically expressed in salivary glands. Interestingly, 11 of the 15 most highly expressed putative secretory proteins were still not matched to function-known proteins. We also detected the expression of 9 interested putative secretory proteins in aphid different tissues, including some digestive and detoxifying enzymes, effectors and Ca 2+ binding proteins. The results showed that only glutathione-S-transferase 1 was specifically expressed in salivary glands. These findings provide a further insight into the identification of potential effectors involving in aphid-cereals interactions.",

During probing and feeding, aphids secrete two types of saliva: gelling saliva, which solidifies into a tube-like sheath to protect the stylet from mechanical damage and chemical attack, and watery saliva, which is secreted into plant cells, intercellular spaces and phloem [8] [9] [10] . The feeding process of aphids is similar to the infection process of plant pathogens, with an interplay between aphid and host plants that follows the plant-pathogen model proposed by Jones and Dangl 11, 12 . Pathogens deliver effectors into the host to modulate plant immunity using a specific secretion system 13, 14 . Aphids are also thought to secrete some salivary proteins as effectors into their host plants to alter cell metabolic processes and modulate plant defense responses 15, 16 .",

The essential roles of salivary protein C002 in the successful feeding of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphone pisum, on fava bean have been demonstrated using RNA interference 19 . Overexpression of M.persicae effector MpC002, potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae effectors Me10 and Me23 in Nicotiana benthamiana increased aphid fecundity, suggesting their ability to suppress plant defenses, however, in planta expression of Mp10 and Mp42 reduced aphid fecundity and Mp10 induced obvious chlorosis response in N. benthamiana, suggested these effectors involved in the activation of plant defense response [20] [21] [22] .",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are involved in signaling pathways to activate plant defense responses and resistance to aphid. For example, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide at aphid feeding sites indicated reactive oxygen species are involved in early signaling of A. thaliana after infestation by the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae 54 . High levels of H 2 O 2 accumulated in a resistant near-isogenic wheat line but not in a susceptible line after infestation by the D. noxia 55 . A sudden rise in oxygen concentration in sieve elements might result in protein coagulation in cucurbit phloem sap 56 . Additionally, high H 2 O 2 levels in plants could be toxic to aphids.

Phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids, which take part in lipid synthesis, lipid-derived signaling pathway and plant stress responses. It is assumed that phospholipases D (PLD) and its products, phosphatidic acid, are involved in plant signal transduction cascades and the lipid metabolic pathway to influence plant stress responses. Gene expression and enzyme activity of PLD increased rapidly after exposure to various stresses, such as mechanical wounding, frost and pathogen infestation [65] [66] [67] . Increases in the PLD transcripts and accumulation of PLD along the plasma membrane were observed after rice leaves were infected with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 68 . Also, PLD participates in the production of plant defense response signaling molecules (ABA, ET, NADPH oxidase) 66 .

The function of ACEs were studied in various insects such as locust Locusta migratoria 74 , cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis 75 and buffalo fly Haematobia irritans exigua 76 . Three ACE genes, ACE1, ACE2 and ACE3, were identified in the genome of A. pisum 77 , and the ACE proteins were also detected in the saliva of A. pisum 29, 72 . ACE1 and ACE2 are highly expressed in the salivary glands, and compared with aphid survival rate on artificial diets, the survival rate of aphids with simultaneous knockdown of ACE1 and ACE2 decreased significantly after aphids fed on plants. These results indicated that ACE1 and ACE2 can function as effectors to modulate plant physiological processes to benefit aphid infestation 77 .",

Although the level of trehalose is very low in plants, many studies have demonstrated that it plays a regulatory role in sugar metabolism, growth, development and stress responses of plants 79 . Overexpressing trehalose biosynthetic genes of microbial and plant origin or receive exogenous trehalose, stress tolerance increased in several plants, such as tobacco, potato and rice 80, 81 . We identified trehalase (c11521_g1, c13987_g1, c14644_g1), which degrades trehalose, in the salivary glands of S. avenae, and it has also been found in salivary glands of B. tabaci and the saliva of M. dirhodum and S. avenae 24, 34 . Trehalase activity in A.thaliana increased before trehalose accumulated when infested with the trehalose-producing pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae, suggesting that trehalase may be a part of the plant defense responses and prevent excess accumulation of trehalose in plant cells 82 . Aphid-secreted trehalase may also play a role in interrupting trehalose accumulation to repress plant defense responses. However, a study showed that exogenous trehalose suppressed the transcript levels of some genes encoding enzymes related to plant defense, wound response, or pathogenesis, such as peroxidase-2 (PRXR2), basic endochitinase (ChiB), endo-1,3-b-d-glucanase (BGL1), lipoxygenase-2 (LOX2), and a chitinase-like protein 1 (CTL1) 83 .

Transcripts of OBPs and CSPs have also been found in salivary glands of N. lugens, M.persicae, M.cerasi and bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi 25, 84 . Insect OBPs and CSPs involved in olfaction and gustation are thought to be crucial for insect behaviors such as locating food and ovipository sites, as well as intraspecific communication 85 , and are mainly specifically expressed in chemosensory organs such as antennae and mouthparts and predicted to function in chemoperception [86] [87] [88] . However, some insect OBPs and CSPs are found in other tissues such as legs, heads, bodies and salivary glands 86 with functions in insect development 89 , leg regeneration 90 , immune responses, and even interactions with the host. For example, Dengue virus (DENV) infection increased transcripts expression of OBP10 and OBP22 in the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti and silencing of the OBP10 or OBP22 genes resulted in a low efficiency of mosquito blood-feeding 91 . OBPs were found in the salivary glands of Anopheles gambiae and predicted to be secreted into host cells to manipulate host physiology by scavenging host amines 92 . Also, CSPs were identified using mass spectrometry as the most abundant proteins in the mandibular glands of larvae of the butterfly Vanessa gonerilla and speculated to play important roles in detecting microorganisms on plant surfaces, recognizing host plants and communicating with conspecifics 93 . CSP4 in cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera and oriental tobacco budworm Helicoverpa assulta possess unique functions that act as surfactants to reduce water surface tension and, consequently, pressure during sucking 94 , suggesting CSPs are involved in insect feeding. Among the CSPs identified in S. avenae, unigene c18419_g1 had high similarity to Mp10 known to be an effector in M. persicae. Mp10, a chemosensory protein was detected in the heads, salivary glands and whole bodies of M. persicae. Functional assays showed that overexpression of Mp10 in N. benthamiana suppressed bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flg22-induced defense responses, but induced chlorosis and local cell death in N. benthamiana, resulting in a decrease of M. persicae fecundity 20, 22 . Thus, OBPs and CSPs secreted by salivary glands of S. avenae may play important roles in aphid-host interactions and warrant further functional study.",

Unigene c13074_g1 and c29740_g1 were annotated as MLH and TPR, respectively. MLH is a DNA binding protein and involved in plant salt tolerance mechanisms.

Schematic drawing of potential roles of secretory proteins from aphid saliva in aphid-plant interactions. During probing and feeding, the aphid secretes saliva into the cytoplasm of the plant cell. Digestive and detoxification enzymes ( ) in salivary proteins facilitate probing and feeding because these enzymes are involved in the breaking down cell walls and membranes, metabolizing sugars and amino acids, and detoxifying secondary metabolites in plant tissues. Some digestive enzymes and degradative products also can induce plant defense responses as potential effectors. Some effectors ( ) in saliva can be recognized by plant transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), resulting in the induction of plant basal defenses (pattern-triggered immunity, PTI). Aphid also secretes other effectors ( ) to suppress plant defenses to promote infestation, resulting in effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS). However, in resistant interactions, an effector ( ) can be specifically recognized by plant resistance proteins (R proteins) according to the gene for gene hypothesis, resulting in a stronger defense responses, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) such as induced cell death. Penetration of plant cell membranes by aphids causes an increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ), resulting in sieve pore occlusion and calcium signaling for defense responses such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Ca 2+ -binding proteins ( ) injected with saliva can bind Ca 2+ , thereby preventing sieve pore blockage and calcium signaling pathways. Also, the hole in the membrane created by the aphid can be sealed after the secreted gelling saliva solidifies into a sheath, minimizing the influx of Ca 2+ and downstream plant defense responses. However, few effectors have been identified, and details of the mechanisms involved in aphid-plant interaction are still unknown.
