The cohorts were further classified into categories, taken as surrogates of age at infection according to the number of years elapsed between year of birth and 1 January of the first year with a DMWCE. This measurement would correspond to a minimum average age at first possible, i.e. post-birth, pertussis infection (PI). A considerable shortcoming of the age at first DMWCE measurement in this ecological approach-particularly if the WCE started in the early months of the birth year-is its low validity as a proxy of age at PI for cohorts born in years with DMWCE. This is because many individual members of such cohorts could have been born after the epidemic had affected the population in the residential area of their mothers, and so conceivably remained uninfected during such an epidemic. In fact, the minimum possible age at PI for this proportion-non-existent in cohorts born in periods free of WCE-would be much higher than a few months since, at the very least, they ought to have become infected after the immediate interepidemic interval.

Details regarding spread were sparse in some cases, particularly for the early epidemics with onset in 1871 and 1880, for which a lack of reported cases from some counties was observed. At that time, physicians were scarce, their reporting habits varied and they might have been absent from some places just when the resident population was affected. The 1871-1872 epidemic affected the capital and, subsequently, the southern regions-where most infants aged below one year died -reaching western and northern Iceland the following year. The 1880-1882 outbreak traced a similar pattern, with deaths reported solely in 1881.

The effect of such a misclassification appears to be particularly relevant for age at first DMWCE in cohorts born five or more years prior to DMWCE. This would give rise to underestimation of the magnitude of an underlying association for this exposure category and of the linear trend. The expected magnitude of the association in studies based on individual age at infection would be higher too because, whereas the ecological measurements here computed correspond to 8 1 -year categories of age at WCE, actual age at exposure for individuals ranged from 0 to at least 14 years in Iceland, 23 despite neonates and very young infants being highly susceptible to the disease. 24 The distribution of 138 incident cases of parkinsonism in Rochester, Minnesota for the period 1967-1979 was: 85.5% IP, 1.4% AP, 7.2% drug-induced and 5.8% parkinsonism-plus syndromes (PPS). 25 Some PPS cases might have been classified as IP by K R A Gudmundsson or, despite poor response to LD recorded for some PPS variants, 26 have been on LD by 1990-1991, hence accounting for the notchy pattern in both data sets. However, since the variability in age at PI is determined by endemicity, closely related to demography 23 -27 (population size and concentration), geographical isolation, and duration of the interepidemic intervals (particularly long in Iceland, 22 -23 ' 29 )and population density was proposed 8 years ago as a major common determinant of LD use and PD, 14 this pattern could be attributable to a phenomenon in which PD is implicated. An inverse relationship between population concentration/density and PD was suggested from a recent reanalysis of PD incidence in Europe (where most such surveys have been conducted), because incidence at ages below 70 years was lowest, in the Netherlands, and significantly higher in southwest Finland and, above all, in Iceland. 16 With regard to risk factors for PD, while multiple interpretations have been given to the well-established, modest, negative association with smoking, 14 ' 28~30 this and other, 9 ' 31 \" 41 (sometimes inconsistent) 31 ' 32 associations such as those with residence in rural environment 9 ' 31 \" 36 (particularly in the first decades of life), 9 ' 33 well-water drinking, 9 ' 33 ' 35 \" 37 neoplasm incidence 38 and mortality, 39 plus a trend with age at measles infection, 40 could all be interpreted as confounding by effects of population density, such as age at PI, since they may merely constitute population-density-associated factors linked to modernization. l4>16 ' 41 In addition, results of a similar pilot analysis conducted in December 1992 in the Azores (San Miguel Island) suggest that, a hypothesis positing a causal link between PD aetiology and age at PI would also apply outside Iceland. 16 This interpretation of our results would imply some reasonable assumptions, namely that: 1) there is an absence of a protective effect or early-in-life PI, as suggested by the historically high lethality of WC in infants; 2442 2) the high PD incidences present in Iceland are not due to high inbreeding rates, relevant for diseases (dissimilar to PD) 10 which display a recessive pattern; 43 and 3) PD behaves in populations and calendar time following a Unitarian pattern. 4 It has been argued that the geographically widespread PD distribution calls for a non-toxic aetiology and alternative hypotheses. 44 However, information available at the present time allows for an eclectic view and synthesis of different proposals.

PT, perhaps the most studied of these, is an ADP-ribosyltransferase capable of inactivating many eukaryotic G proteins involved in cellular metabolism, and determines virulence and immunogenicity, 51 Over the last 7 years, evidence of the short-term effects of PT in striatal dopaminergic function has been accumulated from approximately 100 laboratory reports (because PT has been routinely used to study said neuronal function) but the long-term effects are not known. PT interacts in vivo with the Ni regulatory protein coupled with the striatal D2-dopamine receptor, involved in the receptoradenyl cyclase system. 52 Age-related changes in the dopamine receptor-GPT-binding protein-adenylate cyclase system have been identified using PT, and differences were shown between adult and infant rats in which the striatal function of said system is low. 53 Latencies of considerable duration for exposure-related effects are not uncommon in developmental neurotoxicology. 54 PT injected intracerebrally into mice induced a durable motor neurological abnormality after a log period of one week. 55 However, this could be due to a non-specific effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 83, "end": 85, "text": "50", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 531, "end": 533, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 952, "end": 954, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1189, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1305, "end": 1307, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1429, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "1 -methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) selective nigral neuronal toxicity in laboratory animals is highest for the older rats and macaca, 56 ' 57 and, in the mouse, can be inhibited pretreatment by specific enzymatic action or with a nerve growth factor, BDNF. 58>59 Age-related changes in melanin content or metabolic impairment of SN neurons, 6061 BDNF growth factor availability, or individual variations in cytochrome P450 expression\"\" 13 might constitute individual conditions determining a neuronal substrate sensitization for PT, potentially resulting, in the long run, in a dying-back SN degenerative process.
