In the clinical setting with limited resources, high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose cardiac involvement including myocarditis. Although myocarditis is not reported as a common complication due to lack of diagnostic facilities, there are evidence to support myocarditis is more prevalent in post mortem studies of patients died due to leptospirosis. We present a case series of severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement observed during a period of one month at Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. Case presentation: We report here five patients with severe leptospirosis complicated with cardiac involvement, admitted to a single medical ward, Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka during a one-month period. Out of six suspected leptospirosis patients admitted during that period, five in a raw developed severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement. In this case series, four patients were confirmed serologically or quantitative PCR and one patient had possible leptospirosis. All patients developed shock during their course of illness. Two patients developed rapid atrial fibrillation. One patient had dynamic T wave changes in ECG and the other two had sinus tachycardia. Two patients had evidence of myocarditis in 2D echocardiogram, whereas other two patients had nonspecific findings and one patient had normal 2D echocardiogram. All five patients had elevated cardiac troponin I titre and it was normalized with the recovery. All five patients developed acute kidney injury. Four patients needed inotropic/vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure and one patient recovered from shock with fluid resuscitation. All patients were recovered from their illness and repeat 2D echocardiograms after recovery did not show residual complications. One patient had serologically proven dengue co-infection with leptospirosis. Conclusions: Myocarditis and cardiac involvement in leptospirosis may be overlooked due to non-specific clinical findings and co-existing multi-organ dysfunction. Atypical presentation of this case series may be due to microgeographic variation and unusual outbreak of leptospirosis. Co-infection of dengue with leptospirosis should be considered in managing patients especially in endemic areas.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Leptospirosis is a well-known zoonosis which causes outbreaks particularly in tropical countries. The causative organism is a spirochete of the genus Leptospira. History of leptospirosis is likely to extend to ancient times which is evident by Chinese texts describing \"rice field jaundice\" [1] . In 1886, Adolph Weil describes a syndrome consists of jaundice, splenomegaly, renal dysfunction, conjunctivitis, and skin rash [2] and few years later, Inada described the causative organism of Spirochetosis icterohaemorrhegica [3] now known as leptospirosis. The classical untreated disease is described as a biphasic illness with initial acute leptospireamic phase followed by immune phase. Most cases are self-limited, but some patients develop fatal complications with severe disease. Jaundice and renal failure (\"Weil's disease\"), pulmonary hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), uveitis, optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis are well known complications [4] . After the resolution of febrile phase with the clearance of leptospiremia, the immune phase can occur in less than 10% of patients. However, atypical presentations are reported more frequently in the recent history [5] . In Sri Lanka, these differences of clinical presentations has been observed and attributed to micro-geographic changes [6] . There are more than 250 serovars of Leptospira which have been classified in to more than 31 serogroups and the different clinical manifestations are partially attributed to specific serovars. Understanding and identifying the varying clinical presentations of leptospirosis mimicking other diseases is important in clinical practice for early treatment and management. In this case series, we describe a series of male patients with severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement, presented to a single medical ward during a period of one month. Here we define cardiac involvement as positivity of at least one of following criteria. They are, 1) transient echocardiogram abnormalities during the illness 2) elevated troponin I titer which came down with the recovery of illness, 3) transient electrocardiogram changes during the illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 424, "end": 427, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 525, "end": 528, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1011, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1232, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1357, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "We present five patients who were treated for leptospirosis with complications.
