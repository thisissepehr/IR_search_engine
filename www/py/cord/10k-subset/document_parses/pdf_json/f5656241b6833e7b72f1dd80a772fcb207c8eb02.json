In the present study, progressively deleted lengths of the 5 H noncoding region of segment A were constructed in pGL3 vectors having SV40 enhancer or promoter, and a luciferase (LUC) reporter gene. Transient transfections of the constructs made in a promoter-less pGL3-Enhancer vector when transfected in Vero cells and the lysates assayed for LUC expression, allowed the localization of maximal activity to the 32nucleotide stretch (precursor polyprotein ORF positions \u00c0131 to \u00c0100), which is highly conserved at the 5 H end of both genome segments. This fragment, when evaluated in parallel in an enhancer-less pGL3-Promoter vector demonstrated no activity. To determine if this region is recognized by IBDV replicative proteins, we engineered modi\u00aecations in an enhancer-less pGL3-Promoter vector where the terminal 32-bp fragment, the full-length noncoding region, or the noncodig region with the 32-bp fragment deleted was positioned in either the plus-sense or the minus-sense orientation immediately downstream of the SV40 promoter and upstream of the LUC gene. Transfections of these constructs in IBDV-infected and uninfected Vero cells resulted in the endogenous generation of recombinant viral-LUC RNAs containing the 5 H terminal viral RNA sequences in either the plus-sense or the minus-sense orientation. LUC assays of the infected cell lysates showed up-regulated expression of LUC only with constructs containing the 32-bp fragment in the minus-sense orientation. Deletion of this 32-bp fragment abolished such LUC expression. We therefore conclude that the 5 H -terminal 32 base pairs of genomic segment A contain a major promoter element in IBDV. In addition, our results show that IBDV replicative proteins recognize and transcribe single-stranded RNA in vivo.",

            "text": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a member of the genus Avibirnavirus of the family Birnaviridae. Members of this family are characterized by a double-stranded (ds)RNA genome consisting of two segments, A and B, within a non-enveloped single-shelled icosahedral capsid of 60\u00b165 nm diameter [7] . The genome segments A (approx. 3 300 bp) and B (approx. 2 820 bp) have the putative viral RNA polymerase attached to their 5 H ends through a phosphodiester bond between a guanine residue and a serine [4] , forming a genome linked protein, VPg [5, 24] . This viral protein, which is encoded by segment B [23] , also occurs in virions as a 90 kDa polypeptide (VP1) linked to short stretches of viral RNA [14] . VP1 of IBDV has sequence similarity with known RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of other dsRNA and positive singlestranded (ss) RNA viruses [8] . Segment A encodes \u00aeve viral proteins from two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF): VP5 (16.5\u00b117 kDa) from the small ORF [16, 17] and a 109-kDa precursor polyprotein from the larger ORF, that is processed into structural proteins VP2 (40\u00b145 kDa), VP3 (32\u00b134 kDa) and VP4 (28\u00b130.5 kDa) [3, 12, 15, 17] . VP4 is also a viral protease [1] . The function of VP5 is not known.",

            "text": "All dsRNA viruses require the introduction of a virion-associated polymerase complex into the host cell and its subsequent activation to initiate the viral replication cycle. The biochemical processes underlying this activation of transcription have been studied in several dsRNA viruses [13, 21, 33, 34] . In birnaviruses, transcription is initiated when the virus penetrates the host cell without the need for uncoating or degradation of the capsid, and the precusor molecules gain access to the viral polymerase-template complex by passing through the capsid [33] . Recent experiments with infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and IBDV indicate that virion-associated VP1 also catalyzes a guanylylation reaction which serves to prime viral RNA synthesis; apparently, only the plus strands of the two genome segments are synthesized in vitro, which remain base-paired to their minus strand templates [6] . However, the regulatory sequences involved in IBDV RNA synthesis have received no experimental attention.",

In the North American strains of IBDV, the last 5 nucleotides at the 3 H end of the plus strands are also identical between the genome segments [18] . In this investigation, we use transient transfections in Vero cells with a series of pGL3-Promoter and -Enhancer vector constructs of progressively deleted lengths of the viral noncoding regions ligated to a luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (Promega) to map the cis-acting regulatory sequences of IBDV. To determine if the 5 H noncoding region is recognized by the IBDV replicative proteins, transient transfections were performed in Vero cells infected with IBDV. For this, modi\u00aeed pGL3-Promoter recombinant constructs were used where the terminal 32-bp fragment, the full-length noncoding region, and the noncoding region with the 32-bp fragment deleted were inserted either in plus-sense or minus-sense orientation,\u00afanked upstream by the SV40 promoter and immediately downstream by a LUC reporter gene.

These constructs, upon transfection in IBDV-infected Vero cells, allowed the generation of endogenous plus-sense LUC RNAs by cellular RNA polymerase from the SV40 promoter. This RNA contained immediately upstream of the LUC initiation codon the minus-sense or the plus-sense respective viral RNAs. Figure 4 shows nearly 3 and 7-fold up-regulated LUC expression levels by the minus-sense full-length (pUMS131) and terminal 32bp fragment (pUMS32) constructs, respectively, over those of the corresponding constructs with plus-sense orientation (pUPS131 and pUPS32). Such ampli\u00aeed expression levels exhibited by pUMS131 and pUMS32 constructs were in marked contrast to those of the two constructs where the terminal 32-bp fragment was deleted (pUPS\u00c132 and pUMS\u00c132) which showed no increase in Fig. 3 .

The luciferase activity levels of pGL3-Promoter constructs pPA131, pPA\u00c132, and pPds-oligo32 are represented here arbitrarily relative to that of pGL3-Control vector LUC expression in IBDV-infected cells. These data showed that IBDV replicative proteins in the IBDV-infected Vero cells recognized the regulatory regions in the 5 H noncoding region resulting in modulation of the LUC expression. In uninfected cells, slightly increased LUC activity was detected only with constructs containing the full-length noncoding region (pUPS131 and pUMS131) and the noncoding region with the 32-bp fragment deleted (pUPS\u00c132 and pUMS\u00c132), which was attributed to the presence of enhancer-like sequences in the noncoding region. Constructs containing only the terminal 32-bp fragment (pUPS32 and pUMS32) showed no such increase in LUC activity when transfected in uninfected cells, in agreement with data from the transfection experiments with the pPds-oligo32 construct (Fig. 3) . The transfected pGL3-Promoter (pGL3-P) vector in Fig. 4 shows slightly higher LUC activity over some of the other constructs used in infected and uninfected cells because the viral cDNA inserts were ligated at the Nco I site immediately upstream of the LUC initiation codon instead of the polylinker site as in pGL3-Promoter GeneLight vector (Promega). This resulted in relatively lower translation ef\u00aeciency for all the modi\u00aeed constructs (Fig. 1D) , due to displacement of the Kozak consensus sequence 5 H of the LUC gene of pGL3-Promoter GeneLight vector (Promega).",

Plus-sense RNA transcripts synthesized in vivo are either sequestered by ribosomes for translation, or are packaged into empty procapsids, where they serve as templates for minus strand synthesis similar to what has been reported for other dsRNA viruses [10, 27] . We present here for the \u00aerst time, data that demonstrates that the initial 32-bp stretch of sequence at the 5 H end of genome segment A (precursor polyprotein ORF positions \u00c0131 to \u00c0100) is a major promoter element of IBDV.",

The promoter and enhancer activities of the these constructs in uninfected Vero cells were unexpected as there is no report of sequence identity between IBDV VP1 and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, since Vero cells are permissive to IBDV replication, it is possible that the viral cDNA inserts in the constructs were recognized by cellular transcription factors thereby modulating LUC expression in uninfected Vero cells.",

            "text": "To further determine whether the apparent promoter activity of the terminal 32-bp fragment could be recognized by IBDV replicative proteins, selected regions of IBDV segment A terminal RNA sequences were generated endogenously in vivo. For this, transiently transfected modi\u00aeed pGL3-Promoter constructs were made in which in vivo transcription initiated by cellular RNA polymerase II recognizing the SV40 promoter positioned upstream of the viral terminal cDNA sequences that were\u00afanked downstream by the luciferase coding region (Fig. 1D ) would generate recombinant viral-LUC RNAs when transfected in Vero cells. This strategy is analogous to that previously used in the mutational analysis of in\u00afuenza virus promoter elements in vivo [26] , where cellular RNA polymerase I was used for in vivo transcription of transfected constructs containing recombinant viral terminal cDNA sequences with CAT reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 4 , virtually all the up-regulated LUC activity in infected cells could be attributed to the endogenous generation of viral minussense RNA of the terminal 32 bp upstream of the LUC AUG codon resulting from the transcription by cellular RNA polymerase II recognizing the SV40 Fig. 4 . Comparison of the promoter strength of the 5 H noncoding region of segment A of IBDV in virus-infected and uninfected Vero cells. The values represent the results of at least three independent experiments in which the constructs pUMS32, pUPS32, pUMS131, pUPS131, pUMS\u00c132 and pUPS\u00c132 were tested in parallel with that of pGL3-Promoter vector. The values of the constructs in A are represented arbitrarily relative to that of pUMS32 and those in B, relative to that of pUMS\u00c132. The standard error of the mean was less than 11% in all cases promoter in constructs pUMS32 and pUMS131 (Fig. 1D) . Like other viral RNAs with speci\u00aec cis-acting signals that serve to promote speci\u00aec viral RNA synthesis [28] , the presence of the conserved 32-nucleotide stretch recognized by IBDV replicative proteins would preclude cellular mRNA from entering into the RNA replication of the virus. Figure 5 depicts the possible sequence of transcription events in the upregulation of LUC expression in IBDV-infected Vero cells. Upon transfection, plasmid DNA constructs were transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II recognizing the SV40 promoter. The resulting transcripts were either translated into LUC or served as templates for transcription by the viral RNA polymerase provided in trans in IBDV-infected Vero cells. Since transfections with pUMS32 and pUMS131 constructs alone resulted in up-regulated LUC expression (Fig. 4) , only the cellular RNA polymerase II transcripts containing the 5 H -terminal viral RNA sequence in the minus-sense orientation were initially recognized by the viral RNA polymerase. It also follows that the viral RNA polymerase was able to utilize ssRNA as template for RNA synthesis, and that upon recognition of the promoter sequence in the terminal viral RNA, transcription could proceed in either direction. Probably 5 H \u00b13 H interactions of viral RNA strands are important in determining the direction of transcription. Because of ampli\u00aecation in LUC expression in pUMS32 and pUMS131, the LUC transcripts used for translation must have been at least the second generation transcripts of the viral RNA polymerase. This implies that the viral RNA polymerase was also able to use its own plus-sense transcripts as templates for transcription. Since the plus-sense transcripts of cellular RNA polymerase II (in 5 H \u00b13 H orientation) were apparently not used as templates for transcription, it is possible that the plus-sense transcripts of the viral RNA polymerase (in 3 H \u00b15 H orientation) were somehow modi\u00aeed. It is not known whether the difference in orientation of the plus-sense transcripts was suf\u00aecient to allow the viral RNA polymerase to utilize its own plus-sense transcripts as templates for RNA synthesis. However, the results clearly indicate that while the viral terminal sequences of both negative and positive polarities served as templates for transcription by the viral RNA polymerase, the plus-sense templates were transcribed only if they were transcription products of the viral RNA polymerase (Fig. 5) . This would account for the differences in LUC expression in IBDV-infected cells transfected with constructs in minus-sense and plus-sense orientations (Fig. 4) . It is possible that the regions analyzed for regulatory functions in the present study might have exerted differential translation ef\u00aeciencies on the in vivo generated recombinant viral-LUC RNA transcripts. However, the absence of higher levels of expression in the constructs lacking the viral terminal 32-bp fragment (pUPS\u00c132 and pUMS\u00c132) in transfected infected cells in contrast to the strong stimulation by constructs with the 32-bp fragment (pUMS32 and pUMS131) (Fig. 4 ) indicates that such differential translation ef\u00aeciencies were not a factor in the up-regulation of LUC expression, and that IBDV-speci\u00aec ampli\u00aecation indeed took place rendering endogenously generated terminal viral RNA sequences from these constructs biologically active. Moreover, the LUC assays of the uninfected cells transfected with the same pGL3-Promoter recombinant constructs (Fig. 4) when ran in close parallel with those of the initial transfections (Fig. 3) ruled out any enhancer activity in the viral terminal 32-bp fragment. Additional evidence consistent with our interpretation that the 5 H -terminal 32-nucleotide stretch of genome segment A contains a major promoter region of IBDV are: (i) this minimal region is highly conserved between the two genome segments [18] , suggesting it has functional signi\u00aecance common to the two segments; (ii) this region had maximal promoter strength with no detectable enhancer activity, of the \u00aeve constructs containing viral noncoding sequences transfected in uninfected cells, and the six promoter vector constructs transfected in IBDV-infected and uninfected cells; and (iii) this sequence at the 3 H end of the minus strands for both genome segments A and B has considerable sequence identity with sequences at the alphavirus initiation site for subgenomic RNA synthesis [20] , the polymerase recognition core of rotavirus gene 8 mRNA [28] and the unique consensus intergenic sequences of mouse hepatitis virus [21, 32] (Fig. 6) , which have been suggested to play an essential role in transcription. Any nucleotide differences between IBDV segments A and B within the 32-bp conserved region (Fig. 6 ) may represent positions of lesser importance of recognition by the viral RNA polymerase. By the same token, sequence differences between viruses in the promoter sequences aligned in Fig. 6 may be a re\u00afection of differences in speci\u00aecities of the various viral RNA polymerases.",
