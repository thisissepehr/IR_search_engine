First, the effects of various immunization schemes are studied and compared. When the number of immune is same, the research result shows that the immune effect of the two-step high-risk immunization strategy is not the best nor the worst. However, the practicability is better compare with others. Furthermore, by changing the proportional of immunization the optimal immune effect can be achieved in the two-step high-risk immunization. Computation results verify that the two-step high-risk immunization is effective, and it is economic and feasible in practice.",

In this paper, the SIRS model was selected as our study object.

            "text": "The purpose of immune strategy is protecting the part of network nodes would not be infected by cutting off the propagation path of virus. It is one of effec-tive methods to prevent the virus from spreading on the population. In fact, an efficient immunization strategy can not only be applied to the computer network, but also have an important significance to the diseases spread and control in the human social networks. Currently, various immunization strategies have been proposed, for example: In 2000, Callway proposed a random immunization [25] which the nodes to be vaccinate are selected randomly, while in order to control the spread of the disease we almost vaccinate to all individuals. Obviously, it is not practical. Lately, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani proposed targeted immunization schemes [26] , which immune the large degree nodes firstly. Although there are good effects, but it needs to obtain the whole network topology structure information. In response to this issue, Cohen designs an efficient immunization strategy named \"acquaintance immunization\" [27] . In this scheme, first randomly select some nodes, then randomly immune one of the nodes from their acquaintances. It is evident that the nodes with large degree have more chance to be vaccinated. In recent years, some other immune strategies have been proposed. For example: J. G\u00f3mez-Gardenes put forward on top of real communication networks the immune strategy [28] based on covering algorithm, the effect is basically consistent with the targeted immunization strategy. Madar and Kalisky also proposed the double acquaintance immunization [29] that first randomly selected some nodes, and then randomly immune their two acquaintances. The double acquaintance immunization shows a higher fraction of endemic states than the targeted, but its fraction of infected individuals is still lower than that obtained with the acquaintance immunization strategy. And we proposed a high-risk immunization strategy [30] , which the individuals with infected neighbors were looked as highrisk groups, and by immunizing the high-risk groups to controls the spread of the disease. However, the neighbor's neighbors were not considered in our last work. In this paper, the two-step high-risk immunization strategy was designed based on high-risk immunization. In this scheme, not only the high-risk neighbors were immunized, but also the indirect neighbors of infected individual were immunized too.",

When the probability of k , \u03b4, and is fixed, we can obtain the diffident non-zero epidemic threshold by change the immune proportion of neighbors and indirect neighbors. Then we can achieve the optimal immune effect. Based on the analysis, the corresponding experiments are performed to further verify it. Our simulations are implemented at fixed N = 2, 000, k = 4, and the rewiring rate is 0.1. Initially, 10 % of the susceptible nodes in the network are infected. Suppose that the chance of being infected by its neighbor is equal for all nodes. In other words, in each iteration, the probability of being infected by its neighbor is the same. Simulations were computed averaging over 30 different starting configurations, performed on 20 different realizations of the network.

Figure 5a is the comparison of the immune effect when we change the immune proportion of direct neighbors and indirect numbers in the two-step highrisk immunization. In Fig. 5a , when the proportion of immune direct neighbor nodes from 0.1 to 0.9 increased, and the proportion of immune indirect neighbor nodes from 0.9 to 0.1 decreased, the epidemic threshold \u03bb decreases at begin and then increases. Figure 5b is changing of total number of immune nodes with p and q. Form Fig. 5b , we can see that the total numbers change from 400 to 1,000 when the immune proportion is changed as above. This phenomenon is mainly determined by the characteristics of scale-free network itself. In the construction of scale-free networks there are two important features which are the growth and preferential attachment, so some degree of nodes is relatively large. This leads to a rapidly increase in the number of direct neighbors and indirect neighbors we looked for, which affect the immune quantity. So if a smaller proportion of direct neighbors and a larger proportion of indirect neighbors ( p = 0.1, q = 0.9) are vaccinated, it means that almost all the points are vaccinated in the network, at this time the propagation threshold is large. On the contrary when a larger proportion of direct neighbors and a smaller proportion of indirect neighbors ( p = 0.9, q = 0.1) are vaccinated, the number of immune nodes is relatively small, but the virus transmission route be cut off from the root, and the propagation threshold is large too; once the virus break through the first layer of immune defense, the spread of the virus will unbridle. This is also the reason why the infection density sudden increases when p = 0.9, q = 0.1 in Fig. 5a .",

In Fig. 5b the total number of immune nodes is so large difference, while in practical application, the immune effect is expected to compare in similarity immune nodes. So immune number controlled as is shown in Fig. 6 . Figure 6a shows the variation of infection density with propagation probability when the proportion of immune direct neighbor nodes from 0.1 to 0.7 increased and the proportion of immune indirect neighbor nodes from 0.55 to 0.25 decreased. From Fig. 6b we can see that the total number changes from 500 to 600 generally not big fluctuations when the immune proportion is changed as above. Figure 6 indicates the immune effect when the number of vaccinated nodes is same or similar. In Fig. 6 , for the stronger infectious virus, more indirect neighbors can be immunized to active the optimal immune effect ( p = 0.1, q = 0.55); for not strong infectious virus, more direct neighbors can be immunized to control the spread of disease effectively ( p = 0.7, q = 0.25).",
