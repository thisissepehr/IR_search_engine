They were witness to, and/or themselves victims of, child maltreatment and neglect, domestic violence, or emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. It is estimated that up to 78% of children and adolescents cared for by the youth welfare system had been exposed to traumatic events and 58% had experienced multiple traumatic events [1] . Youths with a trauma history, particularly those living in residential care, have an elevated risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, externalising disorders, substance abuse, or risk-taking behaviour [2, 3] . Moreover, these traumatic experiences can have long-lasting effects on the young person's concept of self, cognitive control mechanisms and problem solving, relationships with others, and attachment to caregivers [4] [5] [6] . In order to account for the maltreatment experiences and trauma-related needs of this highrisk population, efforts have been made to implement trauma-informed care (TIC) practices in various psychosocial settings, especially youth welfare settings [7] [8] [9] . But TIC concepts should not be limited to residential group homes and youth welfare institutions [10] . They are relevant for all psychosocial settings, such as juvenile justice institutions [11, 12] , special needs schools, child and adolescent, as well as, adult psychiatric settings [13] , paediatric health care networks [14] , shelters for the homeless, refugee centres (9) , rehabilitation and detox centres [15] etc. A systematic review [16] of TIC literature on concepts with staff training reported 23 implementation and evaluation studies. The conclusion is, that TIC may improve clinical practice and can reduce trauma symptoms and the psychopathology of clients. Due to the high prevalence of traumatic life events in young people living in out of home placement and the need of placement continuity, some countries have realized countrywide implementation processes [17] [18] [19] . The challenge for youth welfare, juvenile justice, mental health institutions regarding the implementation process of TIC is that lies in the process of organization development which includes fundamental changes in attitudes and key processes and scrutinizes established institutional practice and structures [20, 21] . However, overall the implementation of TIC is associated with higher staff satisfaction [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 652, "end": 654, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 870, "end": 873, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 874, "end": 877, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 878, "end": 881, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1135, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1139, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1143, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1341, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1345, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1436, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1475, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1524, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1564, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1594, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2029, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2034, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2039, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2360, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2455, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Branson [11] describes, in his systematic review, different key variables of TIC.

TIC conceptualises, and reframes, problem behaviour in the context of an individual's traumatic experience(s), and involves anticipating and avoiding institutional and individual practices that could increase the risk of traumatic re-enactment [25] . Besides addressing the needs of traumatised individuals, TIC further aims to promote the self-efficacy and work related resilience of youth welfare staff, by guiding them to a better understanding of their countertransference and personal stress symptoms and by promoting their self-care [23, [26] [27] [28] . Continuous selfawareness and self-care may reduce stress and distress among social-service professionals, thereby enhancing work satisfaction and quality of care in the institution [29, 30] . The ability of staff members, who interact with severely traumatised children, to cope with stress and apply self-efficacy, are key factors for alternative correctional experiences, the reorganisation of trustful relationships and positive attachment representations (f. ex.

Furthermore, traumatic experiences of the children and adolescents may increase the risk of escalating interactions and physical violence against youth welfare staff [34, 35] . Much of the abundant literature on the association between traumatic experiences and auto-aggression has come to the conclusion that traumatic experiences in childhood are a prominent risk factor for aggressive behaviour and conduct problems throughout the course of a survivors' life [12, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . The close correlation could be explained, for example, by the misinterpretation of specific social interactions [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , model learning, deficits in implicit and explicit emotion regulation [49] , especially the selfregulation of aggressive impulses, deficits in the ability to mentalise and be empathic [50] . Since adverse childhood experiences are associated with an impaired ability to regulate or tolerate negative emotions, as well as externalising types of behaviour, affected youths may find themselves relying on counterproductive and detrimental coping strategies, such as opposition, aggression or delinquency when confronted with challenging emotions and situations (e.g., trauma triggers) [36] [37] [38] [39] . Therefore, it is not surprising that frequent exposure to client aggression is a common reality in the professional life of social workers [34, 35, 51] . Alink et al. [34] found that 81% of youth residential care staff experienced client aggression, and about half of them reported physical aggression, within the last year. Another study reported that 91% of youth welfare staff experienced at least one type of verbal and physical aggression, with 53% reporting verbal threats and 24% experiencing physical violence in the past three months [35] . A central aim of TIC is to ensure internal and external safety for both social workers and their clients, including the prospective prevention of violent behaviour [35] . However, the question whether implementation of TIC is associated with a reduction in physical violence against youth welfare staff has barely been investigated. A review on effective strategies for implementing TIC in youth psychiatric and residential treatment settings concluded that TIC might lead to a decrease in client and staff injury rates [8] .

Implementation of TIC practices in youth welfare institutions TIC aims to transform an entire system of care by embedding an understanding of the dynamics and impact of trauma on youths and by creating a safe environment and culture of care, trust, choice, and collaboration [58, 59] . In order to create such an atmosphere, it is crucial to address the security and self-efficacy of the residential staff as well as reorganise some key institutional processes. It is necessary that professionals on all levels of the organisation, including Management, are committed to changing their existing attitudes and practices. Therefore, the management staff and counsellors underwent a specific training in organisational development, supervision skills, and burnout prevention. Implementation of TIC requires a long-lasting commitment of the institutions to allocate resources and building capacity, to fully train the staff with respect to values and principles of TIC, e.g., knowledge of neurobiological and behavioural sequelae of trauma, awareness of trauma triggers, intervening in a trauma-sensitive way, and attention to selfcare in response to working with traumatised clients [23, 57] . Apart from intensive training, the uptake of TIC practices requires ongoing supervision as well as sufficient time for the transfer of knowledge and the consolidation of new strategies into institutional practice.

Our study is the first to show a decrease in Table 3 Prevalence of client physical aggression towards youth welfare staff in the intervention and control groups physiological stress among participants working in institutions with a TIC approach. One reason for the stress decrease might be the focus of TIC on establishing emotional safety by promoting self-care on a personal and institutional level [23, 25] . For instance, traumainformed institutions may provide structures that allow their employees to institute support groups after critical incidents or difficult interactions, with the possibility to reflect on one's own feelings and motives in order to foster and maintain mental hygiene, coherence, mindfulness, and resilience of the staff [52, 60] . We found rates of physical aggression towards youth welfare staff comparable to those reported in the literature, which illustrates that client aggression is a pressing concern that needs to be addressed [34, 35] . However, it is noteworthy that at the last measurement time point, participants in the IG experienced significantly less client physical aggression than those in the CG. Russell et al. [67] showed that TIC is associated with a decline in staff injury rates. Exposure to client aggression is associated with impaired physiological and emotional well-being and may have implications for work satisfaction and quality of care [46, 68, 69] . Of course, this is a bidirectional association, which could lead to either a positive or a vicious circle: boundary violations against staff lead to insecurity and low self-efficacy, this induces reduced pedagogic presence and positive interactions, which can, in turn, enhance the risk of new boundary-violations [70] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 567, "end": 571, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 572, "end": 575, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 921, "end": 924, "text": "60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1135, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1139, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1331, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1569, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1573, "text": "68,", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1577, "text": "69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 218, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Therefore, it is crucial to establish prevention and intervention standards to ensure the physical safety of employees. Furthermore, from a perspective that regards aggression as a failure to regulate emotions in the face of threatening or frustrating situations [60, 71] and through a trauma-sensitive lens, it might be helpful to create an atmosphere of shared decision-making with youths and thus promote their self-regulation and coping skills [72] . The staff's ability to regulate and contain their own emotions in highly stressful interactions is of equal importance in order to recognise and adapt to the young people's needs [73] . As noted above, client physical aggression is highly prevalent in residential youth welfare institutions and may be seen as an innate and unavoidable occupational hazard [35, 73] . Therefore, the staff should work within the framework of institutional structures that encourage communication and the sharing of Note.

The general mental health needs of children and adolescents cared for by the youth welfare system have been extensively studied [1] [2] [3] , whereas knowledge about the professionals' experiences and psychological impact of this challenging area of work is limited. McElvaney and Tatlow-Golden [75] report that professionals working in the care and youth justice system describe themselves as feeling helpless, frustrated and incompetent in the face of the complex mental health needs of their clients. The authors conclude that the staffs own psychological response mirrors the traumatic response of their clients thus, the staff members feel traumatised themselves, thereby possibly contributing to further client traumatisation.
