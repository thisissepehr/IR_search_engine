            "text": "Surfactant protein A (SP-A) increases the resistance of surfactant to inhibition by plasma and other proteins. In a previous study we found that a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody (R 5) increased the sensitivity of surfactant to inhibition by fibrinogen in vivo and in vitro. SP-A has been shown to stimulate microbial phagocytosis and killing by alveolar macrophages. We hypothesized that using R 5 to inactivate SP-A in an animal model mimicking congenital group B streptococcal (GBS) pneumonia might result in increased bacterial proliferation and a deterioration in lung function. Newborn near term rabbits were delivered by Cesarean section, anesthetized, tracheotomized, and ventilated for 5 h in a plethysmograph system allowing measurement of dynamic lung-thorax compliance. Postnatally the animals received one intratracheal injection (5 ml/kg) of R 5, nonspecific IgG, or normal saline. At 30 min all animals received a standard dose of an encapsulated GBS strain by intratracheal injection. The number of bacteria (mean log 10 CFU/g lung \u00b1 S.D.; CFU \u202b\u05e1\u202c colony forming unit) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Histologic lung sections were judged by light microscopy. Bacterial proliferation was similar in rabbits treated with the monoclonal antibody (9.33 \u00b1 0.39; n \u202b\u05e1\u202c 14) and in control animals receiving saline (9.16 \u00b1 0.35; n \u202b\u05e1\u202c 14) or nonspecific IgG (9.26 \u00b1 0.31; n \u202b\u05e1\u202c 11). No significant differences were noted on the histologic analysis or in measurements of lung function. We conclude that intratracheal instillation of a monoclonal anti-SP-A antibody did not increase bacterial proliferation Offprint requests to: Lung (1998) 176:123-131 \u00a9 Springer-Verlag New York Inc. 1998",

New targets for surfactant replacement therapy are currently being identified. Possible new indications include meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, early chronic lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children and adults. In these conditions unlike neonatal RDS there is no primary surfactant deficiency caused by immaturity of the surfactant system [for review, see Ref. 27] . Substances present in the airways under pathologic conditions (like free fatty acids in meconium aspiration syndrome) or endogenous proteins (e.g. fibrinogen or albumin entering the airspaces because of capillary leakage in ARDS) may cause secondary surfactant dysfunction via inhibitory mechanisms [3, 12, 17] .",

Term gestation for rabbits is 30-31 days. At 29.5 days the animals have mature lung function [22] . Antibody R 5 rat monoclonal antibody to rabbit SP-A was generated and purified as reported elsewhere [19, 21] . The final product contained >99% IgG as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No cross-reactivity of this antibody with SP-D or other proteins has been detected to date. The antibody was dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 15 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at \u221270\u00b0C until use. The binding of R 5 to a 30-kDa protein, consistent with SP-A in a natural rabbit surfactant preparation, was demonstrated by Western blotting [see Ref. 20] . In vitro measurements of surface activity of a ''complete,'' SP-A containing natural rabbit surfactant preparation (produced by lavage and sucrose gradient centrifugation [30] ) in the pulsating bubble surfactometer demonstrated a significant increase in surface tension after the addition of R 5 anti-SP-A antibody [20] . We estimated the pool size of endogenous SP-A in term newborn rabbits to be 0.5 g/g body weight, based on the data of Stevens and colleagues [18] . In a fetus weighing 40 g, this corresponds to 20 g. If all of the SP-A were in monomeric form, an equimolar amount of antibody would thus be 100 g. If SP-A is in its natural 18-mer form, 100 g of the antibody is a very large molar excess.",

The peak inspiratory pressure was recorded with a pressure transducer (EMT 34) and adjusted individually for each animal to obtain a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg of body weight. Tidal volume was recorded with a specially designed ''Fleisch-tube,'' a differential pressure transducer (EMT 31), an integrator (EMT 32), an amplifier (EMT 41) and a recording system (Mingograf 81; all equipment, Siemens-Elema, Solna, Sweden).

In theory a surfactant suitable for treatment of RDS in a premature infant may not be optimal for treating a patient with ARDS caused by infectious lung disease. It has been shown that the surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C are of prime importance for the physiologic function of the surfactant system [9] . Inactivation of SP-B by monoclonal antibodies results in immediate respiratory distress and destruction of a functioning surfactant film [15] . SP-B deficiency as a disease (congenital alveolar proteinosis) or as an experimental model (SP-B knockout mice) is a lethal condition. However, after lung transplantation in children with congenital alveolar proteinosis, anti-SP-B antibodies were detectable without impairment in lung function [6] .",

Therefore, these types of studies may not be extrapolated to conclusions regarding ''rough'' (unencapsulated) GBS strains or other bacteria. To induce reproducible pneumonia within a time span of 5 h of ventilation an infectious dose of 10 9 bacteria was applied intratracheally. This is undoubtedly somewhat different from the normal natural time course of an ascending infection. However, such an overwhelming infection is a well described feature of neonatal GBS infections. Despite antibiotic treatment and neonatal intensive care, mortality rates of up to 80% are described in premature babies with GBS infection [28] . Applying a lower infectious bacterial in-oculum to spontaneously breathing animals might result in a localized pulmonary infection.
