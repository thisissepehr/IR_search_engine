Con- sequentl y. eradication of group A rotaviruses is not likely. and exposure to these viruses is inevitable [37] . Effective active or passive (or both) immune prevention methods are therefore essential to reduce the morbidity of rota viral diarrhea. Development of live. attenuated HRV vaccine continues to offer significant hope for providing this protection. but extensive efforts to date have not resulted in an acceptable vaccine [38] , Passive immune protection methods may prove to be useful for at-risk populations. providing the needed margin of safety against rotaviral diarrhea. Reports of successful passive antibody immunoprophylaxis in hospitalized patients [16. 18] suggests that this supportive procedure may significantly reduce the incidence of nosocomial HRV infection. As described by Davidson et al. [18] . the value of such an antibody preparation is broad. with potential for use in hospi- tal nurseries, in day care centers, and at home. Other at-risk populations, including the elderly and immunosuppressed, might also benefit from such a prevention strategy. Ofcritical importance, however, is the need for controlled dosing studies to identify effective and consistent levels of antirotavirus antibody administration. The gnotobiotic piglet represents a useful model for understanding these dose-response relationships. Gnotobiotic piglets are susceptible to challenge by HRV serotypes I (Wa) [21] and 3 (M strain) (unpublished data), yielding diarrhea by a similar mechanism and with similar kinetics to that shown in the human disease. This model represents a considerable advantage, as it is possible to test prototype HRV-specific antibody materials by challenging with HRV strains. Piglet gut physiology (e.g., lack ofpermeability to intact antibody) and diarrheal response are also similar to that of the human infant [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 35, "end": 39, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 40, "end": 44, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 89, "end": 93, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 175, "end": 179, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 293, "end": 297, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 620, "end": 624, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 857, "end": 865, "text": "[16. 18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2040, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Results of studies reported here show the dose-dependent, passive antibody protection from infectious HRV challenge (viral shedding and diarrhea) in piglets fed bovine IgG concentrates from immunized cows.

Because of the variability in antibody titer observed in colostrum and milk immunoglobulin preparations, the conversion to specific activity (VNU per milligram of IgG 1) provided a convenient means of standardizing antibody potency.

Determination of 50% of protective dose (PD so ) for human rotavirus (HRV)-immune bovine immunoglobulin concentrates in HRV strain Wa-challenged gnotobiotic piglets (16 feeding groups, total n = 62). The prevalence of viral shedding (A) or diarrhea (B), observed from days 1-6 (percentage of days), are plotted for each daily antibody dose level tested. PD so levels of 15.8 (range, 10.5-21.1) and 19.5 (range, 14.6-24.4) X 10 6 virus-neutralizing (VN) units fed/day were determined for diarrhea and viral shedding, respectively. End points for each range were determined from the 95% confidence limits of the response regressions at VN antibody dose = PD so . Each linear model was fitomitting the response at VN antibody dose = 89.3 X 10 6 VN units. Significance levels were P = .000 I for both models.
