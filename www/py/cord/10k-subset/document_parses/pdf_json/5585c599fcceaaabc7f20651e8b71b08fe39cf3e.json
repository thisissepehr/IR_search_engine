Its main features included a biotin-streptavidin amplification step and a solid phase consisting of a microporous membrane. Cell samples in the form of suspensions were applied to nitrocellulose or ion exchange membranes immobilized in commerciallyavailable microtiter, multiwell manifolds. The blocking buffer contained 1% purified a-casein. The primary antibodies were monoclonal and the polyclonal secondary antibody was biotinylated. The enzyme utilized was streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The substrate-dye complex consisted of either 4-chloro-l-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide or ortho phenylene diamine (OPD) and hydrogen peroxide. The presence of homologous antiserum in the reaction sequence gave clearly visible, colored reactions on the membrane when 50 ul with approximately 10 ~ or more cfu/ml were present. This new biotin-avidin microporous membrane {BAMM-ELISA) test can be used both to detect mycoplasmas and to speciate them. The BAMM-ELISA is simple, rapid, sensitive, specific and economical. As such, it has potential for aiding in the control of mycoplasma contamination in cell culture, and could prove useful in clinical diagnostic applications as well.",

Incubation was for 10 minutes at 22 ~ C using 4-CN and 30 minutes with OPD, in the dark. The reaction was stopped with distilled water and the wells were decanted. Membranes were removed and air-dried. Each test always included multiple sets of wells of negative controls, to include medium blank without cells and heterologous antisera and/or an ascites control when monoclonal antibodies were used. The degree of reactivity of coloration in these wells were used to establish the background.

While the test is more rapid and sensitive than the metabolic/growth inhibition assay, the fluorescent antisera are very expensive, and a UV fluorescence microscope is required. The response is difficult to quantitate and hence the results are subjective. In addition, some agar and many colonies autofluoresce and cause interference on the interpretation of a positive response.

Biotin and avidin are two naturally occurring biological compounds with a remarkably strong affinity for binding to each other. The phenomenon was originally discovered when animals which were fed large quantities of egg white (containing avidin) developed a vitamin H, or biotin, deficiency. Unique features of the association include the fact that avidin is a 68 000 mol. wt. protein with 4 separate binding sites for biotin {mol. wt. 274). The small size of biotin allows many molecules of it to be bound to proteins without any reduction in biological activity, and each biotin can react with a separate avidin molecule. Even more significant is the nature of the binding. The affinity constant is approximately 10 's M -1, that is, a thousand to a million times stronger than the typical antigen-antibody reaction.",

The multiple steps for biotin binding give an amplification of the reaction, which becomes even further enhanced by using an enzyme as the marker. Steric hindrance as seen with large fluorescein molecules is non-existent, and no special fluorescence optical equipment is required to detect a positive response since it is detectable visually. Background fluorescence is eliminated, and non-speclfic binding is minimal if one begins the reaction sequence by blocking any nonspecific binding sites with excess protein such as the purified casein used here, and uses antibody molecules specific for the antigen in question. The original ELISA system developed for microtiter plates and used as the basis in our test has already given rise to numerous permutations on the immunoenzyme theme. For example, the solid substrate can be in gels (DIG-ELISA, 3), on polystyrene beads (11), polyethylene sticks (39), nitrocellulose disks {29), cuvettes {46) or plastic Terasaki plates {33). Each has both advantages and disadvantages. In the standard ELISA assay in tubes or microtiter plates, or even dot-blot or immunospot assays {29) in which reactant is simply dropped onto sheets of absorptive material, there is an element of risk in the numerous rinsing steps since antigen and/or antibody may be lost. In the BAMM-ELISA described here, the combined use of manifold wells, microporous membrane, and vacuum precludes this danger. Any par-ticulate antigen larger than the pores in the membrane will be retained on the upper, visible surface. This configuration also permits one to add several successive applications d initial reactant, and in effect, concentrate antigen in situ from dilute samples.",
