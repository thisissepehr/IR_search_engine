Cultures of blood, urine, and stool were performed for all patients in the study, and all patients underwent endoscopy/biopsy of the esophagus for detection of Candida. Smears and/or scrapings of oropharyngeal and esophageal lesions were examined for hyphae and/or pseudohyphae and were also cultured for yeasts. During the study period, 1,627 patients were hospitalized in the ICU, 57% for primary medical reasons and 43% for surgical reasons. After application of the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 patients with candidemia (9 IC and 15 NIC) were analyzed. Total parenteral nutrition was more common in IC than in NIC patients (9/9 [100%] vs 8/ 15 [53%], p = 0.02). Oropharyngeal candidiasis was detected in 5 of 9 (55.5%) IC patients and in 1 of 15 (6.5%) NIC patients (p=0.015). Esophageal candidiasis was also more common in IC than in NIC patients (4/9 [44%] vs 0/15 [0%], p=0.012).

We would like to emphasize that oral candidiasis that presents as erythematous candidiasis (in the absence of other specific symptoms and signs) could be difficult to diagnose in critically ill patients and might be occasionally misleading because (a) tubes and other devices placed in the oral cavity are themselves able to produce mild inflammatory lesions, and (b) the increased respiratory secretions and, often, the regurgitated enteral nutrition content may cause inflammation of the oral mucosa.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 138, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 139, "end": 143, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 144, "end": 148, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The clinical characteristics of the eligible NIC and IC patients of the study were well balanced between the groups, except for the more frequent use of parenteral alimentation and the higher Apache II scores in the IC patients.

Additionally, we focused on a subset of patients with ICU-acquired candidemia without prior systemic fungal infection who had not been exposed to prophylactic antifungal drugs. Since, by definition, the term \"ICU-acquired candidemia\" means that the fungal infection is acquired in the ICU, we excluded from our study those patients with previous invasive fungal infection . We should acknowledge that our study has several limitations. First, we were unable to pinpoint the exact time of onset of the esophageal candidiasis, especially since oral thrush was already present before admission to the ICU. Due to obvious ethical reasons, we evaluated our patients for esophageal candidiasis with endoscopy only once. Thus, we do not know if the esophagus was involved before or after the ICU admission. Second, it is unclear if the esophageal candidiasis resulted from hematogenous spread of the fungi in the esophagus, or if the bloodstream involvement was directly related to the oral thrush or the esophageal candidiasis. Third, we did not focus on the treatment administered to patients with candidemia, although we did report that patients with C. albicans and non-albicans candidemia received fluconazole and liposomal amphotericin B intravenously, respectively. Fourth, we do not have readily available data on the length of stay of all patients who received care in the ICU or the total number of cases of candidemia in the ICU, including those excluded, to know how common candidemia is among ICU patients. Fifth, there are no readily available data regarding the type of therapy and the removal of CVCs and the influence of either factor on outcome in the two patient groups studied. Sixth, the sample of our study population is relatively small (study population from a single center) and thus does not permit a powerful statistical analysis; unfortunately, various practical reasons prevented us from incorporating data from other large ICUs into our study. Finally, we do not have readily available data on MICs because the laboratory usually reported the results for an isolate as either \"susceptible\" or \"not susceptible\" to fluconazole.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 525, "end": 526, "text": ".", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we compared various characteristics, including risk factors, manifestations, and outcome of IC and NIC ICU patients with candidemia.
