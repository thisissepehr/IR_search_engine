First, the microbiological specimens were obtained late in the course of the illness after the development of necrotizing pneumonia or empyema, such that these isolates may have represented superinfection with anaerobic organisms. Second, the tracheal sampling was contaminated with oropharyngeal flora of less virulent anaerobic bacteria rather than true pulmonary pathogens. [3] [4] [5] More recent studies using protected specimen brushes to avoid oropharyngeal flora contamination found no anaerobic organisms, 6, 7 suggesting that anaerobic antibiotic agents might be dispensable in the absence of severe periodontal disease, putrid sputum, necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscess formation. Moreover, the role of anaerobic bacteria in aspiration syndrome has been overemphasized in clinical practice. 8 According to current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, anaerobic coverage for communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) is indicated only in those patients with gingivitis and a risk for loss of consciousness as seen with seizure disorders, alcohol abuse or", "cite_spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 95, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 237, "end": 238, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 375, "end": 376, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 818, "end": 821, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 822, "end": 825, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 826, "end": 829, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 956, "end": 958, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 959, "end": 960, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1247, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "For patients with pneumonia, current guidelines recommend narrow criteria as justification for prescribing anaerobic antibiotics.

Our data suggest that the severity of illness was an independent predictor of the choice to prescribe these antibiotics, even when there was no clear indication to do so. There was a twofold increase in inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use in those with a predicted mortality score above the 75th percentile. The relationship between antibiotic prescription and severity of illness has been reported by others. Children with respiratory infections were more likely to be prescribed an antibiotic if the clinician perceived the child to be moderately to severely unwell. 15 Williams et al. found that the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score was a significant factor affecting the number of antibiotics prescribed in patients. 16 One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the clinician may add antibiotics if they perceive that the patient is more ill even if there is no justification for their use. We surmise that this effect may be more pronounced when covering for presumed anaerobic bacteria, because these microbes are rarely isolated in the hospital laboratory. Not surprisingly, the diagnosis of Asp was strongly associated with the use of anaerobic antibiotics, despite the fact that most patients with this diagnosis did not have clear criteria for receiving them. Thus, a major reason for using anaerobic antibiotics inappropriately was the initial diagnosis of Asp. Chart review did not reveal clear reasoning for this diagnosis in patients without a clear indication. Indeed, oftentimes, a clear rationale was not documented in the notes as to how the diagnosis of CAP, HCAP or Asp was determined. Surveys were not done in our study, which may have revealed possible reasons for choosing the diagnosis of pneumonia type. One potential reason was that the choice of antibiotics (and the initial diagnosis of pneumonia type) was initially made by the resident and fellow, rather than the more experienced attending staff.

The criteria used to measure inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use (witnessed aspiration, evidence of periodontal disease or have a co-morbidity with a high risk for aspiration) was in part based on the GI, which rates gingival disease on a scale of 0-3. There is no consensus regarding the definition of poor dentition in medical literature, so a GI score \u22652 was arbitrarily selected as an indicator of poor periodontal condition. It is conceivable that this cut-off score underestimated those patients who received anaerobic antibiotics. Nonetheless, outside of the above risk factors for Asp, there is little evidence to support the use of anaerobic antibiotics. 21 In conclusion, for patients with pneumonia, there was a high rate of inappropriate use of anaerobic antibiotics that was associated with an increased ICU LOS.
