Using curved scissors remove the top of the shell, lift the embryo out by the wing, and place it in a 150-mm Petri dish. 4. Sever the spinal cord just below the back of the head and discard the egg and yolk sac (see Note 5). 5. Position the embryo on its back and, using small forceps and scissors, cut the skin the full length of the body, ending under the beak. Care must be taken not to damage the underlying structures. 6. Locate the trachea and, using small scissors and forceps, dissect it away from the surrounding tissues (see Note 6). 7. Cut the trachea at the levels of the carina and larynx and remove it from the embryo, placing the tissue in a Bijou bottle containing culture medium (see Note 7). 8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all available embryos. 9. Place one trachea at a time on a disc of filter paper and, using two pairs of fine forceps, gently remove as much fat as possible (see Note 8). 10 . Place the cleaned tracheas in a 100-mm Petri dish containing culture medium. 11. Swab the McIlwain tissue chopper with 70% IMS. 12. Place two filter paper discs on top of the PVC cutting table disc and slide the assembled discs under the cutting table clips on the tissue chopper. 13. Raise the chopping arm of the tissue chopper and attach the razor blade. 14. Position the arm over the center of the cutting table (see Note 9). 15. Place tracheas on to the filter paper under, and perpendicular to, the raised blade (see Note 10). 16. Adjust the machine to cut sections 0.5-1.0 mm thick and activate the chopping arm. 17. Once the arm has stopped moving, discard the first few rings from each end of the cut tracheas; then, with a scalpel, scrape the remaining rings into a 150-mm Petri dish containing culture medium. 18. With a large-bore glass Pasteur pipette gently aspirate the medium to disperse the cut tissue into individual rings. 19. Repeat steps 12-18 until all the tracheas have been sectioned (see Note 11).",

The trachea can be identified by the presence of transverse ridges seen down its length owing to the underlying rings of cartilage. 7. The carina and larynx can be identified by the increased diameter at the ends of the trachea. 8. To avoid damage to the trachea hold it as close to one end as possible with the first pair of forceps and use the second pair to strip away the fatty tissue. 9. At this stage gently lower the arm onto the cutting area disc, loosen the screw holding the blade slightly, check that the blade is aligned correctly (the full length of the blade must be in contact with cutting area), tighten the screw again, and raise the arm. 10. A maximum of five tracheas can be laid side by side on the cutting bed at any one time. Gently stretch each trachea as it is placed on the cutting area, and when all five are in the correct position, wet them with a few drops of culture medium. 11.

A simplification of the method of Cook et al. (1976) , used for many years by Cavanagh and colleagues, is to add 0.5 ml of diluted virus per TOC tube without prior removal of the medium already in the tube. TOCs are scored as positive for virus when ciliary activity is completely abrogated. If a virus is poorly ciliostatic, its presence can be demonstrated using indirect immunofluorescence, with the TOCs conveniently not fixed (8).",
