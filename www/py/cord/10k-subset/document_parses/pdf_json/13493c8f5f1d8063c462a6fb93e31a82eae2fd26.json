Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful crossspecies transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs 4 . However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries 5-7 . Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range-which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance.

Not surprisingly, research effort had the strongest effect on the total number of viruses per host, explaining 31.9% of the total deviance for this model (Extended Data Table 1 ). The remaining 17.3% can be explained by biological factors, a value greater than or comparable to studies examining much narrower groups of mammal hosts 10, 12, 15 (Supplementary Discussion). Mammal sympatry was the second most important predictor of total viral richness (Fig. 2d) . Our model selection consistently identified mammal sympatry calculated at a \u2265 20% area overlap over other thresholds explored (Methods), providing insight into the minimum geographic overlap needed to facilitate viral sharing between hosts. Host geographic range was also significantly associated with increasing total viral richness, although the strength of this effect was low (Fig. 2c) . Several Letter reSeArCH mammalian orders, Chiroptera (bats), Rodentia (rodents), Primates, Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) listed here in order of relative deviance explained, had a significantly greater mean viral richness than predicted by the other variables (Fig. 2e ). This finding highlights these taxa as important targets for global viral discovery in wildlife 4 , and suggests that traits not captured in our analysis (for example, immunological function, social structure, and other life-history variables) may underlie their capacity to harbour a greater number of viral species.

A large fraction of the deviance explained is driven by the observed total viral richness per host, supporting the biological assumption that the number of viruses that infect humans scales positively with the size of the potential 'zoonotic pool' 19 in each reservoir host. Removing this contribution by including observed total viral richness per host as an offset, the model explains 33% of the total deviance in the proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (Methods), with 30% of total deviance explained by biological factors (Fig. 2f -i). Some mammalian orders had a significant positive (bats) or negative (two ungulate orders) effect on the proportion of zoonotic viruses (Fig. 2i) . A number of previous studies have proposed that bats are special among mammals as reservoir hosts of a large number of recently emerging high-profile zoonoses (for example, SARS, Ebola virus, MERS) 12, 13, 20 . Our study tests this hypothesis in the context of all known mammalian viruses and hosts.

The proportion of zoonotic viruses shows some upward drift for mammals that are very phylogenetically distant from humans ( Fig. 2g ) that may represent an artefact of preferentially screening marsupials for human viruses. While primate species largely drive the phylogenetic effect, our best-fit model excluded the effect of the order Primates as a discrete variable (Fig. 2i) , suggesting that continuous variation in phylogenetic distance across primate species is more important, and is significant even when all mammals are included.

The response curve for urban to rural population suggests that increasing urbanization raises the risk of zoonotic spillover (Fig. 2h) , as does increasing human population density and the change in urban to rural population ratio over time. A single global metric of human-wildlife ecological contact did not emerge across models. However, the alternate inclusion of these related variables points to the importance of human-animal contact in defining per-species spillover risk globally, and the need for controlled field experiments and human behavioural risk studies to uncover the mechanisms underlying this risk.

To inform their scale and scope we calculate the expected number of as-yet undiscovered viruses and zoonoses per host species using our best-fit GAMs and a scenario of increased research effort (Methods, Supplementary Table 4 ). We then project these 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' geographically ( Fig. 3 , Extended Data Figs 3-8) to identify regions of the world where targeted, future surveillance to find new viruses and zoonoses will be most effective. In the process of translating our non-spatial, species-level predictions to geographic space, we identified several regions where our model predictions of the number of total and zoonotic viruses were systematically biased (hatched regions in Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs 3-8; Methods). Local factors contributing to this bias may include geographic variation in the detection probability of human and/or wildlife viruses, indicating areas where additional research and capacity strengthening for viral detection are most needed. Our model predictions were not systematically biased or clustered across host phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 9 ). Geographic hotspots of 'missing zoonoses' vary by host taxonomic order, with foci for carnivores and even-toed ungulates in eastern and southern Africa, bats in South and Central America and parts of Asia, primates in specific tropical regions in Central America, Africa, and southeast Asia; and rodents in pockets of North and South America and Central Africa. Areas where 'missing zoonoses' predictions were systematically biased varied by taxonomic order, but included large parts of Africa for the all-mammal dataset (Fig. 3a , Extended Data Figs 3-8f). By contrast, the distribution of bias in predicting the 'missing viruses' for all mammals was limited to patches of northeastern Asia, Greenland, peninsular Malaysia, and scattered grid cells in western Asia and Patagonia (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). We also identify geographic regions with large numbers of mammal species currently lacking any information regarding their viral diversity (Extended Data Figs 3i-8i).

We used the body mass recorded in the PanTHERIA database 36 for 709 species. For 3 species, we used the second choice option, body mass recorded in the AnAge database 37 . For 11 species, we used the third choice option of the extrapolated body mass recorded in PanTHERIA, which is based on body length or forearm length, depending on species. For 36 species, we used the average body mass for members of the genus that had a recorded body mass. We explored other life-history variables related to longevity 38 , reproductive success, and basal metabolic rate but these were ultimately excluded owing to the high number of missing records. Phylogenetic signal. We address the issue of non-independence of host species traits owing to shared ancestry 39 in our analyses by first quantifying the phylogenetic signal for each variable in our model using Blomberg's K 40 . Blomberg's K measures phylogenetic signal in a given trait by quantifying trait variance relative to an expectation under a Brownian motion null model of evolution using a phylogenetic tree with varying branch lengths. Blomberg's K-values are scaled from 0 to infinity, with a value of 0 equal to no phylogenetic signal and values greater than 1 equal to strong phylogenetic signal for closely related species that share more similar trait values. While there is no clearly defined K value cutoff in which to apply phylogenetic comparative methods, non-significant value of < 1, or more conservatively < 0.5, are typical for traits that are phylogenetically independent. The only host variables we examined with significant K values > 0.5 were host body mass, and our direct measure of phylogenetic distance to humans. While there are several tools available to control for phylogeny in multivariate analyses, for example, using phylogenetic generalized least square models (for example, PGLS) 41 , there is currently no modelling approach to control for phylogeny using GAMs. More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans versus other host traits including measures of human-wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than 1. We controlled for the significant effect of shared evolutionary history using a phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) 42,43 on body mass. The PVR approach allowed us to remove phylogenetic signal for any phylogenetically non-independent variables and then include the corrected values back in our GAMs, while retaining predictor variables like phylogenetic distance to humans as unmodified. We calculated PVR for body mass using the R package PVR and our custom-build maximum likelihood host phylogeny using cytochrome b sequences constrained to the order-level topology of the mammalian supertree 28, 44 . Our new variable for body mass that controls for phylogenetic signal (PVRcytb_resid) removed most of the phylogenetic signal, with K = 3.5 unadjusted, and K < 0.5 after PVR correction. Our new metric of body mass scales in the same way, with larger values equal to Letter reSeArCH species with larger body mass. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models. Host phylogenetic analysis and phylogenetic host breadth. We used two different mammal phylogenetic trees in our analyses and used a model selection framework to determine which best explained our observed association with zoonotic viral richness. First the mammal supertree was pruned in R (package ape, function drop. tips) to include only synonymous species for the 753 species in our database 28, 45 . We synonymized all host species names between the mammal supertree and the host associations in our database using the IUCN Red List 33 . If the species was listed as 'cattle' it was assumed to be Bos taurus, all other records were excluded if there was ambiguity as to the scientific name for the host species.

Our use of GAMs, an incorporation of smooth spline predictor functions into the generalized linear model (GLM) framework, allowed us to examine the functional form of our predictor variables (for example , Figs 2 and 4) . Categorical and binary variables (for example, host order, IUCN status of hunted or not, and certain viral traits) were fit as random effects of each variable level. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing 52 to eliminate variables from the models. This method removes variables with little to no predictive power and has been shown to be comparable or superior to comparing alternate models with and without variables. We did use the model comparison method for domestic animals, where the sample size was not sufficient for fitting all variables.

We opted not to include these random effects in our final GAMs in favour of keeping only variables interpretable in the context of our host trait-specific framework.

In order to visualize the geographic biases of our non-spatial model predictions in our maps (see above regarding zoogeographic cross-validation), we demarcate regions with significant bias with hatching. Hatched regions represent areas where model predictions of total or zoonotic viral richness deviate systematically for the collection of species in that grid cell. For each grid cell we calculated whether the bias exceeded that expected from a random sampling of hosts. This was accomplished by summing the residuals from 100,000 random draws of species in our dataset that was equal to the number of species present in that grid cell, then identifying grid cells where the observed bias was outside the middle 95% of the randomly drawn distribution. We calculated this for all mammals, and separately for each order across all grid cells. Areas with observed bias (outside of 95% of the randomly drawn distribution) are shown with hatched regions on each missing virus and missing zoonoses map. Letter reSeArCH Data availability.

Variables listed with 'or' under each GAM covaried and were provided as competing terms in model selection, and those in bold were included in the best-fit model using all host-virus associations. Significant variables from each best-fit GAM are noted with an asterisk. Zoonotic viral spillover first depends on the underlying total viral richness in mammal populations and the ecological, taxonomic, and life-history traits that govern this diversity (GAM 1). Second, host-and virus-specific factors may facilitate viral spillover. We examine the relative importance of host phylogenetic distance to humans, ecological opportunity for contact, or other species-specific life-history and taxonomic traits (GAM 2), and identify viral traits associated with a higher likelihood of an observed virus being zoonotic (GAM 3). We estimate the total and zoonotic viral richness per host species using GAMs 1 and 2, and calculate the missing viruses and missing zoonoses under a scenario of increased research effort (b, Methods). Owing to imperfect surveillance in both humans and wildlife and biases in viral detection, there may be uncertainty in the exact proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (b, light grey), and also between the actual, or true, viral richness (dotted lines) and the predicted maximum viral richness per host (dashed line). 49 9  8  10  21  8  1  3  3  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  2  8  2  2  2  4  3  5  5  21  13   22  9  15  6  0  2  2  0  1  1  1  1  1  0  2  1  1  3  3  11  7  6  7  12  6  10  7  10  15   6  1  3  7  1  5  4  1  4  1  1  1  1  0  0  1  0  0  2  3  0  1  1  7  6  12  12  13  23   20  18  4  7  1  0  3  1 extended data table 1 | Summary of best-fit GAMs for total and zoonotic viral richness per wild mammal species, and probability of a virus being zoonotic Models were selected separately using the entire dataset and a stringent dataset that excluded host-virus associations detected by serology.

Species included have at least one described virus association and available genetic data. Wildlife species names and terminal branches are colour-coded by the residuals (predicted minus observed) from the best-fit GAM to predict the number of zoonotic viruses using all data. Species with residual values between \u2212 1 and 1 (black) are accurately predicted within one virus. Warm colours represent species with positive residuals (orange > 1 to 3; red > 3). Cool colours represent species with negative residuals (green < \u2212 1 to \u2212 3; blue < \u2212 3). Marine mammals, domestic animals, and species with missing data and not included in the best-fit models are shown in grey.
