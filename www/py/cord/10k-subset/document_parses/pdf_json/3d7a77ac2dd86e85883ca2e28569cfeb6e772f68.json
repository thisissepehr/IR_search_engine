            "text": "We administered an adenoviral vector, Onyx-015, into the hepatic artery of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer involving the liver. Thirty-five patients enrolled in this multi-institutional phase I/II trial received up to eight arterial infusions of up to 2 \u00c2 10 12 viral particles. Hepatic toxicity was the primary dose-limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models. However, nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity. Therefore, we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function. Seventeen patients were treated at our institution, providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus. No changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of Onyx-015 among these patients. Transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment. These changes occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. In addition, viremia was observed starting 3-5 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient, but was not associated with hepatic toxicity. To further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors, we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver. We found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes. In addition, we found that CAR is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow. CAR is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells. Spatial restriction of CAR to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with Onyx-015.",

            "text": "The survival of patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer is poor. Despite the recent introduction of new cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies, less than 10% of patients are alive at 5 years. [1] [2] [3] New approaches are needed to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncolytic viruses have been engineered to exploit mutations in malignant cells and can destroy tumors by cytolytic and immune-based mechanisms that are distinct from the cytotoxic mechanisms of chemotherapeutic agents. [4] [5] [6] Onyx-015 is the prototype for this class of therapeutic agents. In this viral vector, the E1b-55K gene, which is essential for efficient viral replication, has been deleted. 5, 7, 8 The E1b-55K gene product binds and inac-tivates p53, thereby overcoming p53-mediated checkpoint arrest and apoptosis that would limit viral replication. As E1b-55K binds and inactivates p53, it was hypothesized that this gene would be unnecessary for efficient viral replication in tumor cells with inactivating mutations in p53 or the p53 pathway. 7, 8 The tumor selectivity of this oncolytic strategy is based on the premise that viral replication and lysis of cells would occur in cells with aberrant p53 but not in cells with wild-type p53. Whereas the mechanism of tumor-selective viral replication is controversial, Onyx-015 has shown promise in Phases I and II clinical trials. [9] [10] [11] [12] Viral replication was observed in the tumor cells from patients with head and neck cancer and necrosis of the tumor was demonstrated following direct intratumoral injection. [13] [14] [15] Based on encouraging results from the head and neck cancer trials, we treated 35 patients with advanced GI malignancies on a phase I/II protocol using hepatic artery infusion of Onyx-015. 12, 16 Dose escalation proceeded from 2 \u00c2 10 8 to 2 \u00c2 10 12 particles and no dose-limiting toxicities, including hepatic toxicities, were observed. 16 Adverse events included flu-like symptoms that were observed in 490% of the patients and transient grade I/II hepatic toxicities were observed in about 20% of the patients. As in the head and neck studies, there was evidence of viral replication, tumor necrosis and clinical benefit. 12 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the blood was performed following administration of Onyx-015 and the input virus became undetectable within 6 h after the infusion. Nevertheless, half of the patients treated at doses of X2 \u00c2 10 11 particles had a secondary peak of detectable virus in the blood starting 3-5 days post-infusion that lasted for up to 10 days after the infusion. 12 Despite evidence of ongoing replication of Onyx-015, there were no clinical symptoms of infection of normal tissues such as cough, conjunctivitis or diarrhea; however, necrosis of tumor masses was demonstrated radiographically. 12, 17 Taken together, these findings are consistent with tumor-selective replication of Onyx-015.",

[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Although the objective response rate was encouraging, standard radiographic response criteria may not have captured important clinical responses with this biologically active agent. 12, 17, 23 Forty-six percent of the patients in the phase II study demonstrated transient enlargement of the tumor masses 3 weeks after administration of Onyx-015 followed by regression of the tumors starting 2-3 months after initiation of therapy. 17 Transient enlargement is consistent with inflammation of the tumor masses and this effect, coupled with extensive necrosis and slow resolution of the tumor, may have obscured the actual response rate in this study. Because of the biphasic response curve, patients with clinical benefit as shown by prolonged survival, were not classified as responders by standard radiographic response criteria. By radiographic response criteria, the transient enlargement in many patients would be considered progressive disease. In fact, in the early period of the trial patients were removed for presumed disease progression before the transient nature of the tumor enlargement was appreciated. Partial responses are defined radiographically as 450% reduction in the greatest diameter of the tumor. However, because of extensive necrosis and delayed resolution of these masses, partial responses were not achieved during the period of the study among patients that nevertheless benefited from treatment. The median survival of patients with transient enlargement of the tumors was 19 months. In contrast, the median survival for patients not demonstrating this response was only 6 months and was consistent with the expected survival of 4-6 months for patients who have failed one or more prior therapies. Based on the clinical benefit observed among the patients on this study, additional clinical trials of oncolytic adenoviral vectors are warranted.",

            "text": "The potential toxicity of oncolytic adenoviral vectors has been studied in experimental systems. These systems rely primarily on human tumor xenograft models in immunodeficient mice. In these rodent models, adenovirus constructs were rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation primarily by the liver and spleen, 25 and liver toxicity was the predominant dose-limiting toxicity. 26, 27 The cause of hepatic toxicity includes both direct viral effects and immune-mediated effects. The direct cyctotoxic effects of adenovirus are due to viral replication, inhibition of host protein synthesis, expression of the adenoviral death protein (ADP) and ultimately lysis of the infected cell. [28] [29] [30] [31] Immune-mediated mechanisms of hepatic toxicity include the induction of inflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which can cause transient increases in transaminase levels. Some adenoviral proteins are also highly immunogenic, resulting in immune-mediated destruction of infected cells. However, genes encoded in the adenoviral E3 region prevent T-cell recognition and block TNF-mediated killing of infected cells. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Injection of mice with adenoviral vectors with deletions of the E3 region permitted immune recognition of infected cells but limited the expression of transgenes and increased immunemediated hepatoxicity. 37 Hepatic toxicities resulting from exposure to adenovirus can have different times of onset, degree of hepatic damage and duration depending on the mechanism causing the toxicity. For example, induction of high levels of inflammatory cytokines can cause increases in serum levels of hepatic transaminases. Induction of inflammatory cytokines including TNF, interferon, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 was observed within 12-24 h after exposure to Onyx-015 and became more prominent with repeated viral exposure. 12 Delayed hepatic toxicity could occur following treatment with replication competent viruses, as viral replication proceeds for 72-96 h post infection before cell lysis. Immune-mediated hepatitis would be expected to result in increased hepatic toxicity after repeated viral exposures. Finally, in patients with cancer, we demonstrated that transient enlargement of tumor masses occurs in the first few weeks after treatment with Onyx-015. 17, 23 Enlargement of the tumor masses could cause increased intrahepatic pressure resulting in bile duct obstruction and a rise in blood levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. We reviewed the data from the Onyx-015 hepatic artery infusion study to determine if repeated infusions of adenovirus into the hepatic artery of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer caused increased or idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity.",

These results demonstrate that We have previously reported that the half-life of Onyx-015 in the serum is 12 min and that viral genomes become undetectable by PCR by 6 h following the infusion. 12, 16 About half of the patients demonstrated secondary peaks of viral genomes in the blood that occurred 3-4 days following the infusion of the vector. These secondary peaks are consistent with the time required for viral replication, lysis and release of the viral particles from infected cells. All patients had normal transaminase level 3-4 days following the viral infusion when cell lysis would be expected to occur. Despite viremia with 10 000-100 000 viral genomes/ml, the hepatic enzyme levels were normal in these patients during the period of viremia.",

We have also found that AST and ALT levels are significantly increased in mice plasma following systemic delivery of even low doses of adenovirus (data not shown). However, only limited hepatic toxicity was observed in a small subset of the patients on this trial following intrahepatic viral delivery. These results suggest that the metabolism of adenovirus may differ between mice and humans. Therefore, the replication of adenovirus was evaluated in both normal and malignant To further evaluate the basis for the limited hepatic toxicity observed in these patients, we evaluated the expression and localization of the adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver by immunohistochemistry (Figure 7a ). We found that CAR is expressed at cell junctions between hepatocytes, in particular surrounding the bile canaliculi, a known location of tight junctions that are preventing bile leaks. In contrast, no CAR expression was detected at the surface of hepatocytes that is bordering the space of Disse, suggesting that CAR is not accessible to adenovirus particles in the blood. In addition, we found that CAR is expressed in the tumor cells but is low or absent in the vasculature of the tumor (Figure 7b ). Together, these results indicate that limited access to the CAR receptor and poor viral replication in normal human hepatocytes may limit liver toxicity following delivery of oncolytic adenovirus in human subjects but may permit infection of tumor cells.",

Nearly 200 infusions were administered to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. As hepatic toxicity was dose limiting in preclinical models, we undertook this review to determine if there was evidence for increased hepatic toxicity due to repeated exposure of the patients to Onyx-015. In addition, as hepatic toxicity could arise from several different mechanisms with different patterns of clinical presentation, an analysis of the time of onset, extent and duration of any hepatic abnormalities would provide important information to help guide the safe administration of adenoviral vectors in future clinical trials. This analysis is restricted to the 17 patients treated at the Palo Alto Veteran's Health Care System where we had access to all results of hepatic function tests obtained during the entire course of the study. No significant changes in serum level of hepatic enzymes were observed following the initial treatment with Onyx-015 in these patients. This finding indicates that the administration of this adenoviral vector at doses of up to 2 \u00c2 10 12 particles has minimal hepatic toxicity. One patient developed transient increases in serum levels of AST and ALT starting with the second treatment. These changes were observed by 18 h after the treatment and resolved by 48-72 h after treatment. Not only was the duration of this increase in transaminase levels brief, but the peak transaminase levels were less than 10% of the peak levels commonly seen during other causes of reversible hepatic toxicity including viral hepatitis, chemical toxicity or infusion of chemotherapy into the hepatic artery. The transient rise in AST and ALT levels observed in this single patient with the second and subsequent infusions, occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. The rapid onset and resolution of these mild increases in AST and ALT levels are consistent with a cytokine-mediated effect.",

In contrast, 500-2500 adenoviral particles per cell were produced in the malignant hepatocytes, colorectal carcinoma and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. These findings indicate that adenovirus does not effectively infect or replicate in hepatocytes.

Spatial restriction of CAR could explain the minimal hepatic toxicity observed among these patients. We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression and localization of CAR in normal liver. We found that CAR is localized at sites of hepatocellular junctions, surrounding the bile canaliculi, which are sealed off from their surroundings by tight junctions. This is in agreement with CAR's physiological function as a cell-adhesion molecule that participates in the formation of tight junctions where it physically interacts with the tight-junction protein ZO-1. 47 No CAR was detected at the hepatocyte surface facing the space of Disse or the hepatic sinusoids. Thus, CAR appears not to be accessible for circulating adenoviral particles passing through the liver. We further found that CAR is not expressed on the endothelium of tumor cells but is expressed on tumor cells. Therefore, the limited hepatic toxicity observed among the patients treated in this study may be related to spatial restriction of CAR in the liver. In addition, hepatic toxicity may be limited by the inability of Onyx-015 to replicate in normal hepatocytes. Taken together, these results indicate that tumor cells metastatic to the liver may be selectively susceptible to infection with adenovirus. Therefore, it is possible that CAR expression on tumor cells may predict response to treatment with oncolytic adenoviral vectors.",

Consequently, hepatic toxicity may have been observed among the patients if higher doses of Onyx-015 were administered. However, direct comparisons between rodents and humans are difficult especially with regard to the impact of hepatic artery infusion of adenovirus. The hepatic artery in rodents is very difficult to canulate. Consequently, hepatic toxicity has been evaluated after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of adenovirus in mice. 48 Dilution of the virus into the systemic circulation and uptake of virus in the spleen and other organs after intravenous or intraperitoneal administration will reduce the amount of virus delivered to the liver making Minimal hepatic toxicity of Onyx-015 T Au et al comparison between human and rodent data difficult. However, a dose-limiting toxicity in humans was reached in a related trial using hepatic artery infusion of an adenovirus expressing p53. 49 Dose-limiting cardiac output suppression rather than hepatic toxicity was observed following hepatic artery infusion of 7.5 \u00c2 10 13 particles of an adenoviral vector expressing p53. Accounting for the difficulties in comparing human and rodent systems, similar if not higher doses of adenovirus have been administered to the hepatic artery of humans without the hepatic toxicity observed in rodents. In addition, as human adenovirus does not replicate in mouse tissues, the potential hepatic toxicity of replication competent viruses cannot be assessed in the rodent model but was not observed in the human trials. Unlike preclinical models, patients present with metastatic cancer in the context of a variety of associated comorbidies that may significantly alter the toxicity profile for these viral vectors. Variability was observed between patients and even within the same patient with repeated dosing, emphasizing the importance of careful evaluation and close monitoring of these patients. Further study of the immune response to adenoviral vectors is essential, especially if repetitive treatment is needed. Although thousands of patients have been safely treated with adenoviral vectors on various gene-therapy protocols and millions of people experience adenoviral infections each year without overt symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, idiosyncratic toxicities have occurred. Adenoviral vectors can be used to deliver unique and targeted therapies and can be a useful tool for the treatment of disease. Although additional research is needed to unravel the molecular basis for these idiosyncratic toxicities, it is likely that these toxicities can be avoided or effectively managed and that adenoviral vectors can be used with an acceptable level of risk, particularly among patients with incurable malignancies. With respect to the design of further clinical trials using adenoviral vectors, this study demonstrates that Onyx-015 can be delivered into the hepatic artery with minimal hepatic toxicity at doses where tumor responses were observed.",
