This is to prevent evaporative loss of the amplification mixture and cross-contamination, which may occur among fluidically connected reactors. In most high-throughput nucleic-acid amplification devices, reactor sealing is achieved by microvalves. Additionally, these devices require micropumps to distribute amplification mixture into an array of reactors, thereby increasing the device cost, and adding complexity to the chip fabrication and operation processes. To overcome these limitations, we report microfluidic devices harboring open (unsealed) reactors in conjunction with a single-step capillary based flow scheme for sequential distribution of amplification mixture into an array of reactors. Concern about evaporative loss in unsealed reactors have been addressed by optimized reactor design, smooth internal reactor surfaces, and incorporation of a localized heating scheme for the reactors, in which isothermal, real-time helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) was performed.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Ligase chain reaction (LCR) are examples of methods under this category; and (2) methods that involve co-ordinated catalytic activity of multiple enzymes with/without accessory proteins, at a single temperature (isothermal) (Guatelli et al. 1990 ). Widely used isothermal DNA amplification methods include Strand displacement amplification (SDA), Qb replicase system, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), transcription-mediation amplification (TMA), signal mediated amplification of RNA technology (SMART), isothermal multiple displacement amplification (IMDA), single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA), Rolling circle amplification (RCA), Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), SMart-Amplification Process (SMAP), Helicase dependent amplification (HDA) and circular helicase dependent amplification (cHDA). PCR was the first reported in vitro DNA amplification method (Saiki et al. 1988) . Although PCR is a wellestablished and widely used method for DNA amplification, the need for a specialized high-powered thermal cycling instrument limits the use of PCR in low-powered, hand-held DNA diagnostic devices. Alternatively, isothermal nucleic-acid amplification methods are being developed, as they are ideal for low-powered DNA diagnostic devices, since these methods do not require thermal cycling (Chow et al. 2008 ).",

            "text": "The various isothermal nucleic-acid amplification methods have their own advantages and limitations. SDA is not a true isothermal amplification method, because prior to addition of enzymes, the SDA reaction mixture is incubated at 95\u00b0C to denature the double-stranded DNA followed by 37\u00b0C to anneal primers (Walker et al. 1992) . Becton Dickinson (Sparks, USA) uses SDA technology for their commercial clinical diagnostic assays for detection of Chlamydia and Mycobacteria. In transcription-based amplification system (TAS), three enzymes: reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and T7 RNA polymerase, produces multiple copies of RNA using a double-stranded DNA intermediate (Guatelli et al. 1990 ). The TAS can either produce sense or antisense amplified RNA product from a RNA sense strand (Mueller et al. 1997) . Variations of TAS [also known as self-sustained sequence replication (3SR) system] include nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (Compton 1991 ) and transcription-mediation amplification (TMA) (Pasternack et al. 1997) . Addition of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and optimization of reaction conditions to elevate the reaction temperature to 41\u00b0C improved the specificity of NASBA, when compared to the original 3SR system (Fahy et al. 1991) . Biom\u00e9rieux (Durham, USA) uses NASBA for detection of HIV-1 and CMV. Transcription mediated amplification uses two enzymes: RNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase to amplify RNA or DNA with the help of two primers. Due to enhanced RNase activity of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT), a separate RNase H enzyme is not required. Gen-Probe (San Diego, USA) supplies a commercial system based on TMA for detection of M. tuberculosis.",

LAMP technology uses four primers that recognize six distinct sequences on the target DNA to generate 10 9 copies in less than 60 min (Notomi et al. 2000) . Although LAMP is highly sensitive, primer designing is arduous and requires dedicated software (PrimerExplorer V4). Another isothermal DNA amplification method, SMAP, which is similar to LAMP was reported (Mitani et al. 2007) . In this method, a single tube DNA amplification and SNP characterization was demonstrated by Mitani et al., by developing a new mismatch-suppression technology. In 2004, mesophilic HDA (mHDA), a true isothermal DNA amplification technology, which does not require initial denaturation of double-stranded DNA was reported (Vincent et al. 2004 ). Subsequently, a thermophilic HDA (tHDA) platform was reported . Although SDA, NASBA, TMA, LAMP, tHDA have been successfully commercialized, use of these methods in conventional instruments are limited by their capability to analyze multitude of genes in parallel. Hence, it is desirable to develop microfluidic devices as a high-throughput platform for isothermal nucleic-acid amplification methods.",

Among the isothermal methods, LAMP, tHDA and SMAP are performed at 65, 64 and 60\u00b0C, respectively, while SDA, Qb replicase system, RCA, NASBA, TMA, SPIA are performed at 37, 37, 31, 41, 42, and 48\u00b0C, respectively. tHDA is advantageous when compared to other isothermal methods, since it requires two target specific oligos, similar to PCR, and uses two enzymes: DNA helicase and polymerase. Real-time isothermal DNA amplification methods are desired for the same applications as that of real-time PCR.

            "text": "The microchip with incorporated reactors, inlet and outlet bridge channels, loading and waste channels was fabricated on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) material by soft-lithography techniques (Whitesides et al. 2001) , and then adhesively bonded to a glass substrate (0.1 mm thick). The latter was pre-loaded with different primer pairs for simultaneous amplification at multiple loci of a nucleic-acid test sample. The use of glass substrate facilitates rapid heat transfer from the thermoelectric cooler (TEC) surface to the amplification mixture inside the microreactors [glass has a higher thermal conductivity than PDMS (Lagally et al. 2004) ], and provides favorable hydrophilic surface conditions for capillary based microfluidics. The schematic layout of the microreactors and channels on the chip is shown in Fig. 1a . The loading channel is used for delivering the amplification mixture into an array of microreactors. During the loading step, the amplification mixture flows into the reactors and resuspends the dried primer pair, and in the process the air inside the microreactor is purged out through the air venting port. In order to prevent primer cross-contamination, all the microreactors were isolated from each other by autonomous removal of excess amplification mixture from the loading channel by an absorbent pad through a waste channel. The microreactors on our chip are not sealed during the amplification process, and the amplification mixture evaporative loss in these unsealed reactors was well controlled by reactor design, smooth internal surfaces and a localized heating region of the reactor. The amplification mixture inside the reactors was locally heated on a TEC surface, while a part of the amplification mixture inside the bridge channels does not experience reaction temperature provided by the TEC surface ( Fig. 1a) . A photograph of the PDMS-glass array chip, comprising four reactors, is shown in Fig. 1c . However, for our experiments we used a chip with five reactors. The microreactor, inlet and outlet bridge channels, loading and waste channels are 350 lm high. The inlet and outlet bridge channels are 200 lm wide and 10 mm long, and the microreactor is 1 mm wide and 10 mm long with a surface-to-volume ratio (SVR) of 9.7 mm -1 , and holds a volume of *5 ll. To replicate the PDMS layer of the array chip, a silicon wafer was patterned with photo resist (AZ9260) by UV photolithography using a Karl Suss mask aligner. The wafer was then dry etched by an ICP deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) Si etching system with Bosch technology (STS) (Kuo-Shen et al. 2002) . After the DRIE process, the residual photo resist on the wafer was cleaned with acetone, followed by isopropanol and water. The wafer was then treated with O 2 plasma for 5 min to remove any organic contaminants. Finally, a thin layer of CF 2 polymer was coated on the Si surface using C 4 F 8 plasma, for ease in release of the cured PDMS layer. Figure 2 schematically illustrates the fabrication process of the PDMS-glass hybrid chip. Firstly, PDMS prepolymer (Sylgard Silicone Elastomer 184; Dow Corning Corporation Midland, MI, USA) was mixed homogenously on a magnetic stirrer. The prepolymer PDMS mixture was poured onto the fabricated silicon master, degassed in a vacuum chamber for 20 min and then cured at 150\u00b0C for 30 min. After curing, the PDMS replica containing the microchannels and reactors was peeled off from the silicon master ( Fig. 2a) , and a smooth internal reactor surface was achieved by using PDMS prepolymer. For successful amplification of nucleic-acid in our chip, a smooth inner surface of the microreactors is imperative, so as to prevent bubble generation, which may cause purging of amplification mixture from the reactors, during the reaction incubation temperature. Secondly, the 0.1 mm thick glass substrate (Herenz Medizinalbedarf, Hamburg, Germany) was cleaned (acid-washed) using hot piranha solution (30% H 2 O 2 in H 2 SO 4 ) at 120\u00b0C for 60 min, and then rinsed with deionized water, and dried in nitrogen gas (Huber et al. 2005) . For our array chip, the primer pairs were preloaded on the glass substrate in the desired position. To guide the primer liquor (mixture of forward and reverse primer) loading in the microreactors, a hydrophobic pattern of PDMS precursor (uncured) was fabricated on the acidwashed glass substrate using a PDMS stamp with structure similar to the PDMS layer of the array chip (Fig. 2b) . Thirdly, the primer liquor was then loaded onto the acidwashed glass substrate and dried at 80\u00b0C for 10 min (Fig. 2c) .",

Addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent to HDA mixture significantly reduced the contact angle of HDA mixture on the PDMS layer. The presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 in HDA mixture is essential for capillary based microfluidics in our array chip. Furthermore, Triton X-100 is present in some commercial PCR buffers to enhance the Taq polymerase activity and it is also thought to suppress the formation of secondary structure of nucleic-acid template (Bachmann et al. 1990 ). We also used dynamic coating of BSA at a concentration of 1 lg/ll to avoid any possible inhibition of HDA or PCR (Liu et al. 2006) . The use of additives such as Triton X-100 and BSA is advantageous for most of the template-primer system, including our template system. However, it should be noted that this may not be a general case for other primer-template systems. Figure 3 illustrates the microfluidic operation process, which consists of two steps: (1) Amplification mixture loading; and (2) Isolation of microreactors by removal of excess amplification mixture, in order to prevent crosscontamination of primer pairs. For flow visualization of amplification mixture by capillary action, we added 0.1% Xylene Cyanole FF (Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore) blue dye to the liquid sample. The amplification mixture loading step is shown in Fig. 3b . The amplification mixture filled the microreactors in a sequential manner by capillary action. After filling the microreactor, the DNA amplification mixture enters the outlet bridge channel and stops at the air venting port. The excess amplification mixture in the loading channel was removed by an absorbent pad (GF/D; Whatmann filter paper) through the waste channel (Fig. 3c ).",

The manufactures of the tHDA kit suggest titration of MgSO 4 concentration from 3 to 4.5 mM. We titrated the MgSO 4 concentration (3, 4 and 5 mM) to study the effect of MgSO 4 concentration on HDA yield. For our template-primer system, the optimal reaction condition was determined to be 3 mM. The IsoAmp tHDA kit did not contain BSA, Triton X-100 and fluorescent dye, which we externally added to the HDA reaction in our chip. We externally added BSA, Triton X-100 and fluorescent dye for surface passivation of the chip, capillary microfluidics and real-time amplification monitoring, respectively. For real-time monitoring of DNA amplification product accumulation, we tested the performance (in terms of inhibition) of two DNA-intercalating fluorescent dyes, SYBR Green I (Cambrex Biosciences, Maine, USA) and EvaGreen (Biotium Inc, Hayward, CA, USA). EvaGreen is a DNA-intercalating fluorescent dye, which shows much lower PCR inhibition than SYBR Green I (Mao et al. 2007 ). The absorption and emission spectra of EvaGreen are similar to SYBR Green I. The thermophilic helicase dependent amplification (tHDA) kit from New England Biolabs contains thermostable UvrD helicase (Tte-UvrD), According to the manufacturer's protocol, the IsoAmp tHDA kit can amplify a short DNA sequence from 70 to 120 bp and this limitation is attributed to the limited speed and processivity of UvrD helicase . For isothermal amplification, the HDA reaction mixture was prepared and loaded in the sample port (Fig. 1c) . The distribution of the amplification mixture among the reactors and isolation of the reactors was autonomously achieved by capillary microfluidics. Following this, the PDMS-glass hybrid chip was incubated on the in-house real-time quantitative nucleic-acid amplification instrument (refer to Sect. 2.6) at 62\u00b0C for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity (FI) values of the EvaGreen dye was measured every 1 min.",

The measured temperature is used as an input (feedback) to the proportional-integralderivative (PID) algorithm, which controls the power output to the TEC surface (Qinghui et al. 2003) . Rapid cooling of the TEC was achieved by forced cooling using a fan, and the optics of our real-time nucleic-acid amplification instrument was designed to measure the fluorescence of EvaGreen/SYBR Green I, both are DNA intercalating dyes. The fluorophore was excited using an array of blue LED (Marl International Ltd, Cumbria, UK) centered at 480 nm and fixed at an angle of 45\u00b0to the plane of the PDMS-glass chip surface to prevent interference of the excitation light on the light path of the detection unit.

Although, HDA was successful for reactions with circular plasmid DNA, we linearized the plasmid DNA using BamH1 (Promega, Madison, USA) restriction enzyme at 146 bp upstream of forward primer annealing region, in order to study the effect of plasmid linearization on (1) ability to amplify regions with size outside the specified range (70-120 bp), (2) ability to amplify low concentration of plasmid DNA template, and (3) amplicon yield. We found that the yields of HDA with circular and linearized primer were comparable. Even for reactions with linearized plasmid DNA, the HDA technology failed to amplify region with size of 189 bp (beyond the manufacturer's specified range), and reactions with low concentration of plasmid DNA. We performed all our HDA experiments with DNA template at a concentration of 0.01 ng/ll (3 9 10 7 copies/ll). For our template-primer system, addition of NaCl partially inhibited the HDA reaction, which was evident from our yield data.

Each PDMS chip was loaded with HDA mixture, and incubated at 62\u00b0C for 30 min on the inhouse real-time nucleic-acid amplification instrument. We successfully amplified BNI-1 fragment of SARS cDNA using HDA technology in real-time format. Figure 4a displays the sigmoidal curve for the HDA reaction (*5 ll) in our chip. The characteristic sigmoidal curves were baseline subtracted and smoothed using a three point moving average method (Larionov et al. 2005) . In addition to our PDMS-glass hybrid chip (SVR: 9.7 mm -1 ), we successfully performed HDA in a borosilicate glass capillary (Microcaps, Drummond Scientific Co., USA; ID: 0.63 mm; SVR: 6.3 mm -1 ) in 5 ll reaction volumes. Since the SVR of the glass capillary was low (6.3 mm -1 ), we successfully performed HDA in glass capillary without BSA. The surface effects of microstructures with low SVR on the yield of the amplification reaction are negligible (Krishnan et al. 2004 ). Addition of BSA at concentrations 1 or 2 lg/ll did not increase the yield of HDA reaction in borosilicate glass capillaries. Our results indicate that the coordinated catalytic activity of two enzymes (UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I) still persist on PDMS-glass and borosilicate chip surfaces. To compare and evaluate the performance of HDA in our PDMS-chip, we performed HDA in 5 ll volumes in a commercial real-time nucleic-acid amplification instrument. Since the presence of EvaGreen at 19 concentration partially inhibited HDA, we performed HDA without fluorescent dye and post-amplification analysis was performed by adding EvaGreen (1X), to determine the melting temperature (T m ) of amplicon. The T m values of amplicon and primer-dimer determined by a commercial nucleic-acid amplification instrument are 83.7 and 79.5\u00b0C, respectively. The T m of amplicon product and primer-dimer of HDA performed in our chip are *83 and 79\u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 4b) .

Each PDMS microreactor was loaded with PCR mixture (described in section 2.5) and sealed using semi-cured PDMS prepolymer (precured at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in an oven). Strong sealing of the microreactors is achieved by curing the sealant at 72\u00b0C for 10 min before thermal cycling. The curing temperature of PDMS prepolymer (72\u00b0C for 10 min) did not produce any significant deleterious effect on PCR, since we used a hot-start Taq polymerase (activated at 95\u00b0C, which is higher than the sealant curing temperature). The consistent yield data from our PCR chip, when compared to PCR from a commercial PCR instrument, demonstrate a negligible effect of sealant curing temperature on PCR (Liu et al. 2007 ). The amplification plots for no-template control (NTC) reaction and positive control (PC) of PCR in five microreactors from a chip in microliter (5 ll) and nanoliter (192 nl) volume range are presented in Fig. 5a and c, respectively.

Concerns about PCR failure due to evaporation have been addressed by Burns et al. They found that for reactors having bridge channel volumes of less than 10% of the total reaction volume, the overall PCR efficiency in unsealed reactors, was not significantly affected (Wang et al. 2008) . For our array chip, we controlled evaporative loss of amplification mixture by implementing optimized reactor design geometry, smooth internal reactor surfaces, external heater, selective heating zone, suitable chip substrate based on thermal conductivity and reaction volume. We evaluated the evaporative loss in our unsealed reactor with different bridge channel lengths (L) with isothermal incubation for HDA, and compared the evaporative loss in unsealed reactors for PCR. For HDA, we monitored the evaporative loss at 62\u00b0C incubation for 40 min, while thermal cycling profile as mentioned in Sect. 2.5 was followed for evaporative loss analysis due to PCR. To approximately quantify the evaporative loss during the amplification process we performed a crude method, in which reactors were loaded with amplification mixture and subjected to thermal cycling (PCR)/incubation (tHDA). The reactors were aligned against a length scale and evaporative losses of the amplification mixture at different cycles were enumerated by monitoring the receding front in the bridge channels against the length scale. For reactors with no bridge channel (L = 0), both PCR and HDA failed, due to evaporative loss of 100 and 44%, respectively (Fig. 7) . For reactors with L = 5 mm, performance of HDA and PCR were comparable, since after 40 cycles/min, evaporative loss was *10% for both HDA and PCR. A small difference in evaporative loss due to PCR and HDA method was observed for reactors with L = 10 mm. This difference can be attributed to lower amplification mixture-air interfacial temperature, which is one of the driving forces for evaporation. Based on the result from Fig. 7 , we designed our reactors with bridge channel length of 10 mm.",

Evaporative loss in unsealed reactor for HDA was compared to reactors experiencing PCR thermal cycling amplification. We demonstrated the potential of our array chip by using helicase-dependent amplification method. The combination of our array chip described here, with the sensitive and specific HDA method can be used at resource-limited settings, where expensive instruments are not available. In addition, the amplification mixture distribution among an array of reactors and isolation of reactors are achieved by capillary microfluidics without the need of a sophisticated liquid-handling instrument. In this paper, we reported a scaleable platform and the upper limit of the microreactor density on our chip is not restricted by the microfabrication process, rather it depends on the improvement of the chip operating parameters, such as, parameters to control primer crosscontamination in closely spaced reactors, ability to perform efficient HDA in high surface-to-volume ratio (SVR) microstructures in nanoliter and picoliter ranges. We noticed that increasing the concentration of BSA in nanoliter HDA did not reduce the variability in the threshold cycle. The HDA reaction in nanoliter range can be improved by reducing the number of enzymes without loosing their functions, since in microstructures with high SVR, the probability of two proteins adsorbing onto the surface is high. In other words, a fusion DNA polymerase enzyme with functional domain of helicase might improve the HDA reaction in the nanoliter range.",
