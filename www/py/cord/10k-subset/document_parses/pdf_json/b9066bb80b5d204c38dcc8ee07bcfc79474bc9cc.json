Genetic and antigenic analysis from our laboratories demonstrated that this group of U.S. Type 1 PRRSV has features that distinguish it from typical European Type 1 PRRSV. 1, 2 In order to further characterize this group of U.S. Type 1 PRRSV and provide an essential tool for the future construction of a new generation of genetically engineered PRRSV vaccines for both Type 1 and Type 2 PRRSV, we constructed a full-length cDNA infectious clone of a U.S. Type 1 PRRSV. This is the first Type 1 infectious clone shown to replicate well in MARC-145 cells and represents the second infectious clone of Type 1 PRRSV. In addition, this infectious clone represents a recent member of this genotype, differentiating itself from the Lelystad infectious clone 3 derived from a 15-year-old strain of PRRSV.",

Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were examined by IFA using nucleocapsid (N) protein specific MAb SDOW17 (Fig. 1A) . Results showed that about 5% of cells transfected with pSD 01-08 RNA expressed the N protein. Supernatants from the transfected cells were passaged to na\u00efve MARC-145 cells. After 48 hours postinfection, MARC-145 cells were tested using Type 1 PRRSV specific, anti-Nsp2 MAb ES2 36-19 (Fig. 1B) , and a MAb recognizing both genotypes, SDOW 17 (Fig. 1C) . A Type 2 PRRSV specific, anti-N MAb MR39 (Fig. 1D ) was used as a negative control. The results showed that both Nsp2 and N proteins were detected in MARC-145 cells inoculated with supernatant from transfected BHK-21 cells. Upon further passage in MARC-145 cells (passage 2 on MARC-145 cells), cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within 48 to 72 hours postinfection. These results indicate that viable and infectious PRRSV was rescued from the cells transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA. The cloned virus from the second MARC-145 cell passage was also passaged on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM). IFA results confirmed the presence of virus replication in PAM (Fig. 1E and 1F) , which indicates that cloned virus possessed the ability, as its parental virus, to replicate not only in MARC-145 cells but also in PAM.",

These fragments were assembled into the low copy number plasmid, pACYC177, by restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, and transformation. The 5' and 3' ends of the genome were determined using a GeneRacer kit (Ambion) and assembled into pACYC177 vector. To rescue infectious virus, capped RNA was transcribed in vitro from the pACYC177 clone and transfected into BHK-21C cells using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen).

Growth kinetics was examined by infecting MARC-145 cells with cloned virus and parental virus at a MOI of 0.1. Infected cells were collected at various times postinfection, and the virus titers were determined by IFA on MARC-145 cells and expressed as fluorescent focus units per ml (FFU/ml).
