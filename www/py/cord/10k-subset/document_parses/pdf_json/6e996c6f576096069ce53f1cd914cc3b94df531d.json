Catastrophic biological events such as a lethal pandemic can and do result in a massive loss of human and animal lives and billions (potentially trillions) of dollars in affected nations and regions. Even though infectious diseases have killed more humans and animals throughout history than all wars in human history combined, pandemic threats are rarely among the top concerns of nation-states, which usually focus on nuclear and to a much lesser extent, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction that include weaponized biological organisms. While our ability to detect these pathogens is ever closer to real time, the increased species and environmental interactions that drive pathogen evolution are occurring much faster than our global patchwork of infectious disease surveillance efforts can detect them. By considering emerging pathogens less of a threat to national security than those poised by relatively complex human-engineered weapons systems (like nuclear weapons), we risk nothing less than our ability to survive as viable and sovereign nation-states.",

The second is through a change in the disease \"ecosystem.\" The disease ecosystem refers to the environmental and species interactions that either directly or indirectly lead to the emergence of infectious diseases in one or several species. Examples of this include the zoonotic transfer of pathogens through bushmeat consumption, or by human migrations into previously undeveloped areas, leading to increased interactions with and consumption of wildlife that can and do often harbor pathogens harmful to humans or livestock. The One Health Initiative is a multidisciplinary approach to study the interaction between humans, pathogens, livestock, wildlife, and the environment, and how they can ultimately lead to the emergence of disease.",

            "text": "Research into infectious disease emergence can generally fall within two different strategic approaches. The first strategic approach is to study a specific or model disease system to try and understand the ecology of the disease and how is transmitted and propagated through the environment and different hosts than to extrapolate that disease system knowledge to related pathogens. This type of research is usually designed to be done at one (or a few locations), longitudinally, collecting a plethora of data types in an attempt to understand as much as possible about the disease ecosystem and what leads to the emergence in humans or animals. It is a \"deep dive\" to understand how humans, wildlife, weather, agricultural animals, plants or anything else might impact or play a role in the continued spread of a disease or ecology of its transmission and movement. It is important to note that phylogenetics of genetic changes in a pathogen will likely play a vital role in this last strategy. The data collected for the second strategy can span between the genomic to the geography and climate. The other strategic approach follows the genomics and phylogenetics of pathogens tracking how pathogens are evolving and changing at the amino acid level. The latter is presently the most common line of research, particularly for understanding both seasonal influenza and trying to predict potential pandemic influenza. This strategy is also to look for and catalog new viruses and bacteria in different hosts and environments to understand the overall biodiversity of microbes and pathogenic strains in an effort akin to creating a global genomic database of pathogens and where they originate. The goal is to understand and map pathogens to be more aware of where they might be lurking and display them in the form of heatmaps, with areas of high emergence deemed emerging infectious disease hotspots.",

            "text": "The use of genomic monitoring and pathogen cataloging, rarely leads to the identification of the spillover event or its cause, either at a macro-or micro-level. Of note, however, recent advances in field portable sequencing technologies have led to a more real-time analysis of strain-specific pathogen transmission in humans and animals and have aided in identifying transmission chains and index cases in several outbreaks. In order for us to prevent infectious disease emergence (or re-emergence) into humans, animals, and livestock, it is crucial to know how the pathogen first emerges and transmitted into humans or animals. It is also crucial to understand how the disease may manifest differently depending on the individual host. Not every animal exposed is a host and not every host reacts in the same way, leading to different disease manifestations and outcomes in many cases. If we further understand how a disease is transmitted or the overall ecosystem of the pathogen, we can develop both high-and low-tech interventions to break the chain of transmission. Historically, the most successful interventions in limiting the spread of deadly infectious diseases were developed by observing and developing a keen understanding of the complete lifecycle of the pathogen or its ecosystem. This tenet is particularly true for zoonotic diseases that have emerged or re-emerged into humans. Moreover, most of the aforementioned disease hotspots are in regions of the developing world, where high technology platforms most often fail and cannot be sustained.",

Commonly displayed in the form of heat maps, such infectious disease hotspot maps have indicated for many years that West Africa was consistently at higher risk than average for a large-scale epidemic. However, the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014 proved that subjective/ qualitative knowledge of an area prone to disease is not sufficient to prevent an epidemic. Interventions to protect humans from the emergence of viral diseases in hotspots are possible but only with early and high-resolution visibility into the ecology of viral emergence along with a new set of tools to suppress pathogens before they result in epidemics. The USAID PREDICT Program collected samples from four key animal taxa (and others) thought or suspected to carry those pathogens known to spillover in humans. They equipped many disease hotspot nations with US University-developed plasmid-based standard PCR assays for different viral pathogens that are used to broadly screen animal samples collected by USAID-funded surveillance activities in those countries. Samples are collected, nucleic acids extracted, and collection and any available metadata entered into databases. Samples are shipped back to the USA and sequenced at US academic partner laboratories, all of whom use different techniques and bioinformatics approaches. This process allows for diagnosis of disease but cannot distinguish between viral quasi-species as of yet and relies upon sequencing cores based in the USA and the months of protocols and procedures that require to facilitate full genomic analysis.

In 2011, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundations joined forces to create a specific research call entitled Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID). While a successful program from the start, this program has become increasingly more competitive over the years, with more and more applicants and fewer dollars allocated to each study. While there is no data to support the assertion, researchers have reported being told for any project that seemed to investigate the ecology of infectious disease, the investigators should submit to EEID instead.

That is not to say that these programs do not offer great value to microbiology and science; they without question do. However, to categorize them as a means to either predict or respond to lethal infectious epidemics is somewhat misleading. In more than ten years of dedicated programming and hundreds of millions of dollars, no lethal epidemics have been predicted or prevented. The advances in genomics and sequencing technologies are increasingly being incorporated into outbreak response and have provided invaluable insights into disease transmission chains. These technologies are predicted to become even more robust and standardized in the coming years and will continue to play essential roles in molecular epidemiology and disease transmission chain identification. Viral and pathogen cataloging is essential to science, but if our aim is to protect humans, animals, and livestock, this approach will have minimal return on investment and should arguably remain in the category of \"museum\" science where we continue to catalog and under the biodiversity of life on this planet, both in the present and those that existed before the emergence of humankind.",

            "text": "History has taught us that certain types of diseases and syndromes lend themselves to emerging into highly lethal and catastrophic epidemics and pandemics. Some are seasonal and ever-present, like influenza and Lassa fever, while others are still at the stage of individual spillover events, like SARS and MERS. Still, other diseases that were previously considered no longer threats to humankind are re-emerging as threats to human lives due to the societal shifts toward anti-vaccination attitudes and behaviors. By studying model disease ecosystems in each of the categories that we know can and have killed millions in the past, we can prepare ourselves to respond to both known and novel threats that will continue to emerge as increased pressures on the environment change the earth's ecosystem dynamics. If we have learned anything from history, it is that we need to be nimble, flexible, and ready to respond to these diseases as they emerge. In the future, it may indeed be possible to predict disease emergence using a combination of technology, social awareness, and continual surveillance for pathogens and other epidemic indicators. However, at the time of this writing, more than a decade of disease prediction and pathogen cataloging efforts at enormous costs to the public has had a measurably low return on investments, as evidenced in the major epidemics that have occurred during that time. To safeguard our future, we have to understand the ecosystems of lethal pathogens, and from that knowledge, be able to extrapolate and adapt as new threats emerge.",
