However, our data suggest that bacterial adherence and patterns of bacterial colonization of the neonatal gut play a pivotal role in the development of NEC. In this context, factors that change or modify the innate pattern of microbial colonization should be given serious consideration in the management of preterm infants. To begin with, infants under aseptic NICU care have very limited exposure to microorganisms. Use of broadspectrum antibiotics in the management of respiratory and other associated conditions in these group of infants could further damage the existing microflora. Endogenous antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and cryptdins, have an increased antibacterial property on Gram-positive organisms compared with Gramnegative bacteria (38, 39) . Elimination of or decrease in the population of such Gram-positive organisms may have a profound effect in circumstances in which the infant's intestine is colonized with only two to three species of bacteria.
