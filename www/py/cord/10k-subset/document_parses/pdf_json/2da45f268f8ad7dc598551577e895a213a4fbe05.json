Because neuroendocrine mechanisms may mediate these effects, we measured the effect of FR on the messenger ribonucleicacids (mRNAs) encoding all of the tropic hormones of the anterior pituitary (AP). Slot blot and solution hybridization were conducted on AP ribonucleicacid (RNA) samples obtained at 0500 h (AM) and 1500 h (PM) from 3-month-old male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum (AL) or FR (60% ofAL calories) since 6 weeks of age. Poly A RNA/fig total RNA was similar in AL and FR rats, indicating that there was no overall effect ofFR on mRNA levels. The level of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was not reduced by FR when expressed per fig of RNA or as total AP content. By contrast, the total AP content of the mRNAs encoding LH$, FSH% TSH$, GH, and PRL was markedly reduced by FR. When expressed per fig of RNA, however, only GH (AM and PM), FSH$ (AM), TSH$ (PM), and PRL (PM) were reduced by FR. These results reveal that FR differentially affects pituitary tropic hormone mRNA levels within weeks after onset of FR, and are consistent with a role for neuroendocrine alterations in the initiation of adaptive cellular responses to FR.",

Although the greatest extension of life span is achieved when FR is initiated early and sustained throughout life, an increase in longevity has even been observed when rats are foodrestricted for only a few months during early adulthood (2) . These data indicate that anti-aging effects begin shortly after the onset of FR and are cumulative. This concept is important theoretically as well as practically, since it indicates that insight into the anti-aging mechanisms induced by FR may be obtained by studying young FR animals.",

The absence of a difference in metabolic rate (per unit body mass) indicates that the characteristics rather than the magnitude of fuel utilization are altered in ways that retard aging. Evidence that fuel is utilized differently by FR animals includes the fact that their reproductive processes are often attenuated (4), protein synthesis and turnover are enhanced (5) , and metabolic pathways are qualitatively altered (6) . Many of these changes have occurred by 6 weeks after the onset of FR. Although the mechanisms whereby FR prolongs life are not established, growing evidence suggests that even after a few months of FR, animals exhibit enhanced resistance to carcinogenic insult (7), greater detoxification capacity (8) , and more rapid recovery from inflammatory processes (9) . Thus, in addition to changes in metabolic processes, candidate mechanisms for the anti-aging actions of FR are also activated shortly after the onset of FR.",

This result, along with the fact that FR animals exhibit elevated plasma corticosterone levels in the afternoon, indicated that at least one endocrine system regulated through the pituitary was not suppressed by FR. This study was designed to complete the assessment of the effect of FR on pituitary tropic hormone mRNAs in young rats as an initial step in determining the extent of modulation of AP hormone biosynthesis by FR. The focus on young rats that had been under FR for only 6 weeks was designed to gain insight into the initial neuroendocrine effects of FR that might play a role in the induction of the anti-aging effect of FR.",

In this article, mRNA levels are expressed in two ways: (a) total amount in the pituitary and (b) normalized to |ug of total RNA. The former measure provides an index of the effect of FR on the total pool of substrate available to the animal for translation. The latter provides a measure of specificity of the effect of FR on a given mRNA species beyond any general effect of FR, because polyA RNA levels normalized to total RNA were unaffected by FR (see Figure 1 ). Thus, any differences between FR and AL animals in levels of mRNA/ug total RNA reflect effects not generally observed across mRNA species.",

            "text": "Polyadenylated RNA.-Anterior pituitary (AP) polyadenylated (polyA) RNA was measured to determine the influence of food restriction on overall mRNA levels. When expressed per ug of RNA, the polyA RNA of AL and FR rats did not differ in the early morning (p = .30, t test) or afternoon (p = .37, t test) ( Figure 1A) . However, the total amount of RNA in the AP of FR rats was about half that of AL rats (diet main effect, p = .0001, Figure IB) . Thus, the AP content of polyA RNA was significantly reduced in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0001, Figure 1C ). Figure 2 shows the effect of FR on the levels of POMC mRNA in the AP. The data in Figure 2 were published previously, but are presented because they enable a direct comparison to the mRNAs encoding the other pituitary hormones, which were measured from the same animals. POMC mRNA levels in a separate cohort of FR and AL rats confirmed the results shown in Figure 2 (data not shown). When expressed per ug of RNA, POMC mRNA was significantly increased in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0015, Figure 2A ; diet main effect, p = .014, with the separate cohort). The increases were about 80% in the morning and 40% in the afternoon (Figure 2A ). However, because the total amount of RNA in the AP of FR rats was about half ( Figure IB ) that of AL rats, the AP content of POMC mRNA of AL and FR rats did not differ ( Figure 2B ). Figure 3 shows the effect of FR on the levels of the gonadotropic hormone (3 subunit mRNAs. Expressed per ug of RNA, LHpi mRNA was significantly increased (-15-20%) in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0078, Figure 3A ). Time of day had no effect on LH(3 mRNA expression (time main effect, p = .46). However, in contrast to POMC mRNA, the AP content of LH(3 mRNA was significantly reduced in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0016, Figure 3B ). Figure 3C shows the level of FSHp mRNA per ug of AP RNA. Although there were no significant differences between the two dietary groups (diet main effect, p = .33) and between the morning and afternoon values (time main effect, p = .15), there was a significant interaction effect (p = .036). In the morning, but not in the afternoon, FSH0 mRNA/ug RNA in the FR group was lower than that of the AL group (p = .0058, t test). Also, in contrast to AL rats, morning FSHfJ mRNA levels in FR rats were less than afternoon values (p = .017, t test). FSHfi mRNA content was markedly reduced in FR rats compared to AL rats (diet main effect, p = .0001, Figure 3D ). Thus, FR had different effects on the two gonadotropic hormone P subunit mRNAs. A major difference in the effect of FR on the gonadotropic subunit mRNAs from its effect on POMC mRNA was the marked reductions in total AP content of both LHp and FSHp mRNAs in FR animals. Figure 4 shows the effect of FR on the levels of TSHp mRNA, GH mRNA, and PRL mRNA in the AP. Figure 4A shows the level of TSHp mRNA per |ig of AP RNA, which differed significantly between the two dietary groups (diet main effect, p = .0032). In addition, there was a significant interaction effect of diet group and time of day on this variable (p -.040) although there was no time main effect (p = .17). This interaction effect was reflected in a lack of dietary effect on TSHpJ mRNA/ug RNA in the morning but a significant reduction of this variable in FR rats in the afternoon (p = .0045, t test). The AP content of TSHp mRNA was markedly reduced in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0001) B326 HANETAL. ( Figure 4B ). Also, there was a diurnal variation of TSHp mRNA, expressed per ug of AP RNA (p -.013, t test), in AL but not FR rats. Figure 4C shows the levels of GH mRNA per jug of RNA. FR significantly decreased GH mRNA/^g RNA (diet main effect, p = .0001). The AP content of GH mRNA was dramatically decreased in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0001, Figure 4D ). PRL mRNA per jug RNA was significantly reduced in FR compared to AL rats (diet main effect, p = .036, Figure 4E ). AP content of PRL mRNA ( Figure 4F ) was markedly reduced in FR rats (diet main effect, p = .0001). DISCUSSION This study demonstrates that 6 weeks of food restriction in young rats has marked and differential effects on steady state levels of the mRNAs encoding the major tropic hormones in the anterior pituitary gland. Whether all of these changes persist throughout the life span of FR rats remains to be determined. However, these changes are of potential importance to the initiation as well as maintenance of the altered state of the FR animal and to the anti-aging mechanisms of FR, because even short periods of FR can reduce reproductive activity (4), enhance cytoprotective actions (7) (8) (9) , and prolong life span (2) . Rats that have been restricted for 6 weeks exhibit altered metabolic and hormonal characteristics that persist in many cases into old age. For example, blood glucose and insulin levels are lowered by 3 months and remain lowered throughout the life span (3). Plasma concentrations of triiodothyronine are similarly lowered throughout the life span of FR rats (11) . Diurnal levels of plasma total corticosterone levels are elevated by FR in young and middle-aged rats, but not in older rats (12) , although plasma free corticosterone levels appear to be maintained at an elevated level by FR throughout the life span (12) . Moreover, enhanced cytoprotective mechanisms are seen in young FR animals (7) (8) (9) , suggesting that the altered physiological status of FR that may contribute to the anti-aging effects of FR is present in young FR animals. Thus, the changes that have been observed in this study may be important to the altered metabolic and cytoprotective state that contributes to the extended life span of FR animals. Changes that are sustained throughout the life span of FR rats are most likely to play important roles in the anti-aging actions of FR, however, and it will ultimately be important to assess which of the changes observed in the present study are sustained into old age by FR.",

POMC mRNA content was not downregulated by FR, whereas mRNA contents of all the other hormones were reduced 40-80% by FR. POMC mRNA levels, whether expressed as total pituitary content or normalized to RNA, were maintained by FR at higher levels relative to those of the other tropic hormone mRNAs. It is debatable which of the two ways of normalizing the data-as content or per (ig of RNA-is biologically more meaningful. Regardless of the normalization mode, POMC mRNA levels were uniquely affected by FR. Although LH|3 mRNA, when expressed per (ig RNA, was also elevated by FR, its elevation was modest. POMC mRNA was elevated two-to fourfold more than was LHp mRNA.",

            "text": "Why is POMC mRNA uniquely affected by FR? One possibility is that there is a relationship between POMC and the hyperadrenocortical status of the FR animal (15) . The diurnal peak of plasma corticosterone is elevated by FR in rats (12) and mice (9) , whereas all of the other major hormones appear to be reduced by FR (10, 11, 32) . One might postulate, therefore, that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates corticosterone release, would be elevated by FR and, accordingly, so would its precursor mRNA, POMC. However, our earlier observation that diurnal plasma ACTH concentrations are not increased by FR (15) indicates that the relationship between POMC mRNA and ACTH secretion in FR rats is not straightforward. There appears to be drive to stimulate POMC mRNA levels in the FR animal which is blocked distally (i.e., at the level of translation or secretion) such that circulating levels of ACTH are not concomitantly elevated. It is tempting to speculate that the unique elevation of POMC mRNA provides an enhanced substrate reserve to the FR animal that enables greater production of glucocorticoid-stimulating ACTH, in the event that an unusual stressor may present itself to the FR animal.",

With the exception of LH(3, the mRNA levels of these hormones normalized to total RNA were also reduced at one or both of the sampling times. These results indicate that FR suppresses steady-state levels of these mRNAs at one or both sampling times beyond the overall suppression of total RNA content. Whether this repression involves transcription, RNA processing or degradation remains to be determined. These findings, however, are consistent with previous reports of FR effects on circulating levels of the cognate hormones. For example, blood levels of TSH and GH have been reported to be repressed by chronic FR (10). Sonntag et al. (35) suggested that acute and chronic restriction differ in their effects on GH; FR decreases GH pulse amplitude early in life but chronic FR increases GH pulse amplitude. In a study involving short-term FR, TSH levels were unaffected (32) . Although the linkages between mRNA level, intercellular synthesis, and secretion of peptide in the circulation do not necessarily correlate and can be affected by multiple intervening processes, these results provide a plausible explanation for the reduction in circulating levels of TSH in the chronically food-restricted rat. Branson and Heideman (32) reported that the blood levels of luteinizing hormone, GH, and prolactin were suppressed by short-term FR. In their study, circulating levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and TSH were unaffected by short-term FR. Other studies (12, 36, 37) , however, reported reduced thyroid hormone levels in chronically FR rats.",
