PaO 2 /FIO 2 was significantly higher in the NIV group than in the control group at 2 h after inclusion, and this trend remained for the first 72 h, similar to previous studies [13, 19] . However, despite an initial improvement of arterial hypoxemia, the use of NIV did not result in changes of the intubation rate nor outcome variables in our study. In a recent large trial of immunocompromised patients admitted to the ICU with hARF, early NIV also did not reduce the incidence of intubation or mortality compared with oxygen therapy alone [20] . However, the median duration of NIV in this study was 8 h within the first 24 h, 6 h on day 2, and 5 h on day 3. This negative study therefore may represent insufficient support time for NIV therapy. In our study, average NIV duration was more than 16 h per day. Despite this support time dose, we did not show a positive effect on avoidance of intubation. Finally, the management of continue NIV in the NIV group or crossover to NIV in the control group after the patients met the intubation criteria may influence the final outcome such as mortality, length of ICU or hospital stay, or complications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 419, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 855, "end": 859, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 860, "end": 863, "text": "19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1224, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Such a long period of NIV support through a facial mask may affect the patient comfort.

A recent clinical trial suggests that NIV administered to patients with severe lung injury could increase ventilator-induced lung injury by generating tidal volumes that exceeded 9 mL per kilogram predicted body weight [24, 25] . However, the VT/PBW was between 7.7 and 9.4 mL/kg in the present study. A low expired tidal volume is almost impossible to achieve in the majority of patients receiving NIV for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The high tidal volume resulting from the high respiratory drive in these patients may lead to lung injury and NIV failure [26] . High tidal volume and minute ventilation were also found in NIV patients in LUNG SAFE study [10] . And in FLORALI study, NIV did not result in significantly different intubation rates compared to standard oxygen in patients with non-hypercapnic hARF, and the intubation rate in NIV was even higher than standard oxygen. This study suggests that high flow humidified nasal cannula (HFNC) may be more beneficial than NIV or standard oxygen [24] . This may also be explained by lung injury caused by high driving pressure during NIV. Based on our data, the parameter of MV should be monitored for a limitation of less than 11 L/ min in early mild ARDS. The differences in PaO 2 /FIO 2 and minute ventilation between NIV failure and success patients, shown after 12 to 48 h of NIV application, are similar to a failure time of 1 to 48 h after NIV initiation reported by Ozyilmaz et al. [27] . In the NIV group of our study, mean delay between inclusion and failure was almost 5 days, and longer than 2.6 days in the control group. At the intubation time point, the NIV group has a worse state than the control group with lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 (120 mmHg vs. 147 mmHg) and higher RR, which may suggest a delay in intubation by use of NIV. Furthermore, we noticed that, during the first 2 to 12 h after inclusion, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio did not improve, and with a high MV trend for patients in the NIV failure group compared to the success group. This may be an early predictor for NIV failure for the pneumonia-induced mild ARDS. And recently, a HACOR score was proposed for patients with NIV failure in hypoxic patients [28] . HACOR score improves in patients with NIV success and remains unaltered in patients with NIV failure, which also emphasized the trend of the five predictors from the score is important for predicting NIV failure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 324, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 325, "end": 328, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 667, "end": 671, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 766, "end": 770, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1116, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1560, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2287, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Severe pneumonia is frequently of acute onset, demonstrates bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, and causes severe acute respiratory failure not due to cardiac failure.

The recruitment rate was also slower than expected because of a strict enrollment and exclusion criteria, potentially leading to time bias over the course of the study.
