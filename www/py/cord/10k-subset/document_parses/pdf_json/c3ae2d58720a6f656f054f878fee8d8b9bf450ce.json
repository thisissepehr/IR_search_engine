Background: Lung cancer has been the most prevalent and the most deadly malignant cancer globally, which is still incurable disease in essence. Immunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 represents a breakthrough in the treatment of lung cancer. Nevertheless, the response rate of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy remains unsatisfactory, due to tumor resistance and complexity of immune microenvironment. To enable more patients to benefit from immunotherapy, a thorough understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 expression will be pivotal for novel combinational immunotherapies. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a critical player of glycolysis, conducing to tumor progression and immune response. However, the correlation and clinical significance of PKM2 and PD-L1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remain not entirely explored.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 170, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Germline Mutated Malignant Mesotheliomas: Are These Morphologically Different from Sporadic Malignant Mesotheliomas?"}, {"text": "Design: Expression of PKM2 and PD-L1 were detected by immunohistochemistry in 74 cases of LUAD and the corresponding noncancerous tissues.

High expression of PKM2 in tumor cells (TCs) was significantly related to lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. Moreover, PKM2 expression in TCs was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in TCs. High expression of PKM2, PD-L1, as well as both PKM2 and PD-L1 in TCs and immune cells predicted high mortality rate and worse survival, respectively.

Background: Identification of ROS1 rearrangements in advanced lung cancer carries therapeutic implications, given the available ROS1targeted therapy, but can be technically challenging. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ROS1 show expression in ROS1-rearranged tumors, but staining may be weak in some cases and seen in reactive pneumocytes.

Background: Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), is a non-invasive method which allows 3-dimensional morphometric analysis of tissues in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks without any sectioning or loss of sample. Lung adenocarcinoma has a major five tissue patterns according to the 2015 WHO classification (lepidic, acinar, papillary, solid and micropapillary).

Background: Quantification of PD-L1/PD-1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not always predictive of efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and response to these agents remains limited to a minority of patients. Human Leukocyte Antigen 1 (HLA-1) participates in presentation of aberrant peptide antigens, enabling cytotoxic T cells to recognize and destroy tumor cells. Correspondingly, loss of HLA-1 expression precludes immune recognition, and this loss is one proposed mechanism of treatment failure of immunotherapy.

HLA-1 was scored as intact, partial (clonal) loss, or complete loss with total absence of staining. Conclusions: HLA-1 loss is common in NSCLC and can readily be assessed by immunohistochemical methods. In this study, there is no association between PD-L1 expression and HLA-1 expression. Given that HLA-1 expression may be a determinant of response to immunotherapeutic agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, it may be considered as an adjunct immunohistochemical marker prior to initiation of immune checkpoint therapy or in instances of treatment failure.

Other histologic findings were variable, e.g. nonnecrotizing granulomas and upper lobe predominance are noted in 50% of the patients. Pulmonary hypertension was seen in all of the patients except one who had a very early disease. Conclusions: STS associated lung disease frequently shows UIP with additional findings including inflammatory (lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate) and hypersensitivity pneumonia-like (granulomas and upper lobe predominance) features. Consideration should be given to testing for STS in patients with UIP with these histologic findings. It is important to identify this cohort of patients because these patients may have a more rapid progression of their ILD and an increased toxicity from immunosuppressive drugs especially in post-transplant setting.

This study reports PD-L1 expression level in a large patient population of NSCLC in Canada.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 268, "text": "-1978", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 269, "end": 285, "text": "- Figure 2 -1978", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 254, "end": 262, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Design: PD-L1 testing of NSCLC was performed for patients from the whole province of British Columbia, Canada in a centralized provincial pathology laboratory at BC Cancer, Vancouver Centre.

PD-L1 expression level in adenocarcinoma was similar to that in squamous cell carcinoma (p>0.05), but was significantly higher than in NSCLC, NOS (p<0.05, Table 1 ). The overall percentage of high PD-L1expression (TPS\u00b350%) was 39%. The high PD-L1 expression (TPS\u00b350%) was found in 42% distant metastases, 45% mediastinal lymph nodes, and 35% lung primary tumors. The differences in the distribution of high PD-L1 expression among distant metastatic sites, mediastinal lymph nodes metastases and primary sites had statistical significance (c2=11.8, p<0.01). Conclusions: Using FDA approved Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 phamaDx assay, we found that adenocarcinoma had a similar PD-L1 expression level to squamous cell carcinoma but significant higher expression than NSCLC, NOS. The percentage of high PD-L1 expression (TPS\u00b350%) was significantly higher in mediastinal lymph nodes and distant metastatic sites than in primary sites, which suggests that PD-L1 testing of metastatic NSCLC could identify more patients eligible for immunotherapy. Figure 1 -1980 - Figure 2 -1980 Conclusions: The correlations among FS, FSC, and RT are low. FS STAS+ cases remain STAS+ only in 60% of FSC and 48% of RT.

The 2016 Banff study confirmed capillary inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), and endothelialitis as morphologic features in lung allograft biopsies that correlate with the presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). Alveolar septal widening (ASW) is another AMR feature recently described in a multicenter pilot study. We performed a retrospective study to review the histologic features in surveillance transbronchial biopsies and determine the statistical significance with the presence of DSAs.Design: Surveillance biopsies of patients with available serologic data between June 2018-19 were retrieved from departmental archives. A total of 30 biopsies were available, of which 15 were with DSAs and 15 with no antibodies (NABs).

PDL1 is now a standard biomarker along with molecular testing for therapy selection. Checkpoint therapy is given front-line for patients with high PDL1 and no actionable mutations or fusions, or after progression with any PDL1 expression. Studies comparing PDL1 status in the context of actionable mutations or fusions in NSCLC are sparse.Design: All patients undergoing molecular testing for a next-generation sequencing (NGS) lung cancer panel at our institution in a 7 month period were reviewed. This included an NGS DNA panel for actionable/driver genes: EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, K/NRAS, PIK3CA, and IDH1/2; and a NGS RNA fusion panel for ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK1/3, NRG1, and MET e14 skipping. PDL1 expression by IHC was scored for tumor proportion score (TPS). Statistical comparison was performed using Fisher's exact test.Results: 184 patients with NSCLC were included (138 adenocarcinoma, 29 squamous/adenosquamous, 14 poorly differentiated, and 3 NSCLC-NOS); 140 of those had concurrent PDL1 IHC.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is characterized by frequent genetic alterations in several genes including NF2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)/p16 (found in the 9p21 locus), and BRCA1 associated protein (BAP1). Recent studies using fluorescence in situ hybridization for NF2 (NF2 FISH) have identified hemizygous loss (chromosome 22 monosomy or hemizygous deletion) as the most common molecular alteration of NF2. However, the effectiveness of NF2 FISH for differentiating MPM from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RMH) or reactive mesothelial cells (RMC) is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether NF2 FISH, either alone or in a combination with other diagnostic assays [9p21 FISH, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) immunohistochemistry (IHC), and BAP1 IHC], is effective for distinguishing MPM from RMH or RMC in tissue specimens and cell blocks obtained from pleural effusions.Design:We examined tissues from 53 MPM and 27 RMH cases and cell blocks from 22 MPM and 20 RMC cases. We used FISH to examine the deletion status of NF2 and 9p21 and IHC to determine the expression of MTAP and BAP1.Results:Histologically, hemizygous NF2 loss as detected by FISH showed 49.1 % sensitivity and 100% specificity in differentiating MPM from RMH. A combination of NF2 FISH, 9p21 FISH, and BAP1 IHC yielded greater sensitivity (98.1%) than that detected for either assay alone (75.4% for 9p21 FISH, 67.9% for MTAP IHC, or 52.8% for BAP1 IHC). In cytological analysis, FISH detection of hemizygous NF2 loss showed 50.0 % sensitivity and 100% specificity in differentiating MPM from RMC. A combination of NF2 FISH, 9p21 FISH, and BAP1 IHC yielded greater sensitivity (100%) than that detected for either assay alone (59.1% for 9p21 FISH, 54.5% for MTAP IHC, or 83.3% for BAP1 IHC).

While intra-operative assessment of STAS in frozen section (FS) has been advocated by thoracic surgeons to guide management, information on the reproducibility and accuracy of FS for diagnosing STAS is limited to date.Design:We evaluated 73 T1 lung ADC resections previously assessed by intra-operative consultation (IC) and with ample non-neoplastic lung parenchyma in FS slides. Five pulmonary pathologists blinded to clinicopathologic data independently and separately reviewed paired FS and FS permanent (FP) slides in each case evaluating for STAS (presence, absence, or equivocal) and processing artifacts per published criteria(Kadota et al. JTO 2015). Separately, a consensus panel of 3 pathologists reviewed all the slides in permanents to reach a final integrated assessment for STAS on each case and recorded additional parameters, including the number of tumor clusters identified as STAS. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by comparing the most prevalent diagnosis achieved by >3 observers with the final integrated diagnosis. Performance characteristics including interobserver agreement (IOA), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined.Results: STAS was identified by the consensus panel in 11% of 28 low-grade, 32% of 19 intermediate-grade and 89% of 26 high-grade tumors. The Fleiss kappa value for the STAS diagnosis among the 5 observers in FS slides(0.30\u00b10.03[\u03ba\u00b1SE]) was lower than that in FP slides(0.41\u00b10.03), but both increased to 0.63\u00b10.05 and 0.82\u00b10.05, after removal of cases considered as equivocal by any observer. Detecting STAS by FS showed high specificity (95%) and PPV (88%), but low sensitivity (46%) and NPV (70%). Processing artifacts were frequently noted by most observers, present in 82% of STAS-positive, 87.5% of equivocal, and 46% of STAS-negative FS slides. IOA in FS was higher in low-grade tumors (p=0.008), STAS-negative cases (p<0.001), those without artifacts (p=0.03), and STAS-positive FS slides with >10 STAS clusters (p=0.04).Conclusions: FS is highly specific but not sensitive for the diagnosis of STAS in Stage I lung ADC. IOA on STAS is only fair in FS, partly due to concurrent artifacts, raising concern on implementation of IC for STAS assessment.

There is limited information about Ki67% values in pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC). The 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) describes Ki67% as 40%-80% in LCNEC but provides no specific references.Design: Sections from 77 consecutively resected LCNEC diagnosed by WHO criteria were stained with Ki67 antibody (Ventana Inc, Tucson AZ). Ki67% was measured using Aperio ScanScope AT Turbo, eSlide Manager and ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems, Vista CA) as previously reported. Cases were stratified into 6 classes by 10% Ki67 increments. Using the Kaplan-Meier method and SAS version 9.4 software (Cary, NC), overall (OS) and disease-free survivals (DFS) were compared by AJCC (8 th ed) stage, by 6 Ki67% classes, and with Ki67% cut-points at 20% and 40%.Results:The 42 males and 35 females ranged from 46 to 87 years of age at diagnosis. The tumors ranged from 0.9 cm to 11.5 cm. AJCC (8 th ed) stage groups included IA (n=33), IB (n=7), IIA (n-2), IIB (n=16), IIIA (n=16), and IIIB (n=3). 32 (41.6%) LCNEC had a combined adenocarcinoma component. Ki67% was measured only in the NEC component. The system measured Ki67% positivity using 4072 to 44533 tumor nuclei per case (mean 16610 \u00b18039). Ki67% ranged from 1% to 64% (mean 26%; median 26%). Surprisingly, only 16 (21%) tumors had Ki67% \u2265 40%. OS ranged from 1 to 298 months (median 25 mos).

Tumor clonal relationships were assessed by comparing somatic alterations between the separate tumor sites.Results: Twenty-one patients with genomically-profiled IMAs involving contralateral (n=19) or ipsilateral different lobes (n=2) were identified. In most patients (n=14), tumors had discrete nodular presentation. Second IMA presented metachronously in 11 patients with a mean latency of 4.2 years. Notably, in 3 patients, contralateral spread manifested \u22658 years (up to 11 years) after initial tumor resection.

A subset of patients presented with solitary large tumors. While primary pulmonary melanomas (PPM) is a category included in the thoracic WHO classification, given the absence of normal melanocytes in the lung its existence has been questioned. Herein we investigate genomic profiles of melanomas of unknown primary origin involving the lung. In particular, we sought to determine whether UV genomic signature -a characteristic feature of most cutaneous melanomas -is present in such tumors.Design: Cases of melanomas involving the lung with no known primary elsewhere were identified retrospectively. The clinicopathologic characteristics of each case were annotated. All cases included in the study underwent targeted DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) interrogating up to 468 cancer genes. Genomic signatures were analyzed based on a method described by Alexandrov LB et al. (Nature 2013; 500:415-421) .Results: Ten NGS-profiled melanomas involving the lung were identified. Five patients had solitary lung lesions with the median size of 5.2 cm (range 2.6 to 10.1 cm). Of those, 3 tumors were endo/peri-bronchial, thus meeting the suggested criteria for PPM. Hilar nodes were involved in 2 patients, and 8 tumors had epithelioid morphology resembling non-small cell carcinoma. No evidence of primary melanomas was found for any patients on clinical follow-up (median 28 months; range 5 to 42 months). Genomic testing revealed the following driver mutations commonly found in melanomas: BRAF (n=6), NRAS (n=1) and KIT (n=1). Genomic signature analysis was feasible for 8 cases harboring >20 mutations required for reliable analysis, including 4 patients with solitary masses. This revealed the presence of a dominant UV signature in all cases.

Clinical presentation as solitary large (reaching >10 cm) masses occasionally with hilar adenopathy and epithelioid morphology may closely mimic primary lung carcinomas both clinicoradiologically and pathologically, representing a major potential diagnostic pitfall. Background: Pulmonary invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) commonly presents as a multifocal disease. It is widely recognized that diffuse 'pneumonic-type' IMA represents aerogenous spread of a single tumor. However, IMAs may also present as discrete nodules in different lobes, raising the possibility of separate primary tumors. Here, we explored the clonal relationship of IMAs involving different lobes using comparative molecular profiling.Conclusions: Molecular profiling supports that multifocal IMAs involving different lobes represent intrapulmonary spread of a single tumor rather than separate primary tumors, including tumors presenting contralaterally after a remarkably long latency (>8 years). Overall, these findings reinforce the unique biology and clinical behavior of IMAs, and draw a sharp distinction with multifocal non-mucinous lung adenocarcinomas, which recent molecular studies confirm to represent predominantly separate primary tumors.
