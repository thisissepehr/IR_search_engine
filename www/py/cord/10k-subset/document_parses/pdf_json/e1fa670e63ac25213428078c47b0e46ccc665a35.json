Therefore, viral infection is defined as a presence of an identifiable viral organism with inflammatory symptoms.

Viruses live in the host cells, and the presence of some viruses (cytomegalovirus [CMV], BKV) may be suspected by characteristic changes on urine cytology [11] . Otherwise, a virus has to be grown in culture, and the type of virus is determined based on characteristic cytopathologic changes of cell culture inoculated with the specimen. This diagnostic method is cumbersome and prone to false-negative results. Not all viruses can be cultured. AdV, CMV, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza, mumps, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and varicella-zoster virus can be cultured, but this technology is not applicable for detection of Coxsackie A viruses, hepatitis viruses, arbovirus, parvovirus, human papillomavirus, reovirus, measles virus, and gastrointestinal viruses. To increase detection, 1 mL of body fluids or tissues have to be placed in a special transportation medium (eg, M4) as soon as possible and placed at 4\u00b0C until they reach the laboratory. Medium can not be frozen and most laboratories will not accept specimen obtained on a bacterial transportation swab. Because each of the viruses requires specific cell line, media, and method of detection, it is especially important to provide adequate clinical information and to be specific about the type of virus to be detected. Unlike bacterial specimens, one can not order a general \"viral culture.\" Because of the cost and time required for diagnosis using culture, most laboratories have shifted to other techniques, which can be generally divided into methods detecting the presence of pathogen (antigen), such as direct immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); methods detecting genetic material (DNA or RNA), which is a specific finger print of the virus; and methods detecting antibodies in the serum or central nervous system, such as ELISA or competitive ELISA.

The darker the color in the well, the more antigens (viral particles) present in the specimen. In competitive ELISA, the tracer antigen competes with the specimen antigen for a set number of binding sites. In this assay, the lighter color after developing reaction means that there is a higher concentration of virus in the patient's sample. ELISA is also used in the detection of antibodies. In this assay, the antibody is an antigen. ELISA is a relatively simple and fast technique that is often used in automatic assays; however, small changes in volumes of sandwich antibodies or developer will affect the results (pipetting error). In automatic instrumentation, the chemicals are dispensed from prefilled containers, and \"carry-over\" contamina-tion between different runs of assay can easily occur.

Because developments of antibodies against a virus take time and use of immunosuppressants may modulate immune response, lack or presence of antibodies may not exclude or confirm current infection. This is especially true in viruses, such as HSV, CMV, and BKV, with a high prevalence (17%, > 60%, and > 90%, respectively) among an immunocompetent population in the United States [15, 16] . HSV and BKV are especially important in urology. To find out if a patient was ever exposed to HSV, one can measure immunoglobulin G against HSV levels, which should be elevated. During acute or recent infection, the immunoglobulin M titer allows for differentiation of new viral infection versus history of exposure in the past. Immunoglobulin M increases within 2 weeks of exposure. The results for antibodies are reported as titers, and increasing titers make it more likely that the patient has current infection. Because of some nonspecific binding of a patient's antibodies to the antigen, good quality laboratories stratify their titers into negative, undetermined, and positive. Undetermined titers can be a result of nonspecific binding or of current infection when the host has not yet produced enough antibodies to be detected. If levels of antibodies are within an undetermined level, the assay should be repeated in 2 to 4 weeks, or direct method of detection should be used.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 466, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 467, "end": 470, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnosis of Viral UTI"}, {"text": "Because of problems with detection of antibodies and poor correlation between the viral load and the ELISA, as well as the fact that many viruses are present in immunocompetent hosts, the current state-of-the-art detection techniques are based on molecular techniques [17] .

Because the genome of most of the clinically important viruses is known, it is relatively easily to amplify viral DNA or RNA and to detect amplicon by gel electrophoresis, chromatography, or real-time PCR. Real-time PCR allows for relative or absolute quantification of viral load. The results are reported as number of virions per mL or number of units per mL of specimen.

The genome of some viruses is not stable, and one needs to choose the most stable \"conserved\" sequence that can identify the virus of interest with high specificity. Even a single change in the nucleotide sequence can affect the binding of primers, and if the annealing temperature is high, the presence of a virus may not be detected (false-negative result). The viruses also occur in multiple genotypes (example HPV or AdV); thus, often one assay is not able to detect all genotypes. Because the PCR reaction produces millions of copies of viral DNA \"amplicon,\" it is easy to obtain falsepositive results from airborne amplicon contamination. Therefore, in many laboratories, the preparatory and analytic areas are physically separated, and high-performance flow hoods are used when amplified samples are handled. The real-time PCR, which eliminates transferring of amplified product to the gel, avoids many of the contamination problems and has become a method of choice for molecular detection of clinically important viruses.

Generally, viruses are divided based on type of nuclei acid that they are made from (DNA or RNA), and subsequently, they are divided into groups based on replication properties such as single-or double-strand. The most commonly used classification is called the Baltimore classification (coined for its creator, American biologist and Nobel laureate, Dr. David Baltimore), and it divides viruses into seven groups. Clinically, viruses are often group-based on clinical picture, though viruses with different biochemical properties can lead to a similar pathology ( Table 2 ).

BKV has a significant homology to a neurotropic virus, causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or JCV. BKV was first identified in the urine of a renal transplantation recipient with the initials B.K. (by Dr. Sylvia D. Gardner in 1971). The BKV virus has a urotheliotropic nature and can be identified in the collecting system epithelium and transitional epithelium. The typical cytopathologic changes of BKV are often found in a healthy person, and it is believed to represent transient shedding of virions in urine, most likely secondary to stress or decreased immune response. The patient's cytopathologic changes resolve within 3 months, and there seems to be no clinically significant sequelae of BKV-positive cytology in immunocompetent people [20] . High-grade transitional cell carcinoma can be difficult to distinguish from BKV on cytology, and follow-up cytology may be considered in patients with risk factors for transitional cell carcinoma [21] . Up to 0.3% of the healthy population and 3% of pregnant women will have BKV-positive urine cytology [22] . The interest in BKV paralleled development in potent immunosuppressants and the discovery of an association between reactivation of BKV in patients with renal transplantation and progressive nephropathy and allograft loss-polyomavirus-induced nephropathy [23] . The BKV is commonly found in the urine of patients with hemorrhagic cystitis and ureteral strictures, especially after bone marrow and solid organ transplantations [6, 24] .

Recipients of renal transplantation may also have associated graft dysfunction, and renal biopsy may show typical interstitial nephritis with characteristic changes in tubules. The presence of BKV in renal parenchyma may be detected by commercially available antibodies. Because of the high prevalence of positive antibodies in the serum and lack of a reliable viral cell culture, the diagnosis of BKV lower UTIs requires molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time PCR, which allows for the detection of BKV and an estimation of the number of viral copies per mL of urine or blood [25] .
