Deficient numbers of HLA-DR positive epidermal Langerhans cells have also been described in AIDS.\"* Our two patients had lymphopenia, decreased T-helper cells, inverted ratios of T-helper to T-suppressor cells, depressed natural killer activity, diminished proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens, and in the one patient tested, cutaneous anergy. It seems reasonable to assume that the severe poxvirus infections in our two patients were somehow related to their immune deficiency. Although healthy individuals, particularly sexually active homosexual men, may develop molluscum contagiosum, the striking progression of lesions in Case i has not been observed in healthy adults. In addition, the distribution of lesions in these cases was reminiscent of childhood molluscum contagiosum, in contrast to the usual anogenital distribution of lesions in adult cases related to sexual transmission.^\"'^^ Previous reports have described severe molluscum contagiosum in patients receiving chemo-therapy^^ or corticosteroids,''''^^ and in patients with sarcoidosis,^** or with eczema.^^'^'^\"^\u00c2 uthors of these reports have suggested that immune defects were involved, ^f\".28,30.31 i^^, ^^m ethods used for quantifying immune function were not extensive. The incidence of molluscum contagiosum in AIDS is not known, but since the appearance of our brief report describing the first patient,' we have become aware of other cases.\"'^\"^^^ This virus thus joins the list of opportunistic DNA viruses that may cause significant morbidity in patients with AIDS. Whether the apparent predilection of AIDS patients to illness from double-stranded DNA-containing viruses is due to the tendency of these organisms to persist in a latent phase, to a specific impairment of cellular immunity to these agents, or to a selective advantage in intracellular replication by these viruses requires further study. Physicians should consider the possibility of an underlying immunodeficiency in patients presenting with severe molluscum contagiosum.",

Other lymphocyte phenotypes were identified with murine monoclonal antibodies (Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, U.S.A.) and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Cooper Biomedical, Malvern, PA, U.S.A.). OKIai recognizes the human DR antigen complex expressed on B cells and activated T cells, OKT3 is a pan-T cell marker, OKT4 recognizes the helper/inducer subset and OKT8 recognizes the suppressor/cytotoxic subset. Cell populations were enumerated using an EPICS V fiow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL, U.S.A.). Lymphocyte blastogenic responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (05 f.iglm\\) (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle, NC, U.S.A.), and to the antigens Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) (100 /ig/ml) (Burroughs Wellcome), tetanus toxoid (1:1000 dilution) (Lederle, Pearl River, NY, U.S.A.), and streptolysin (1:200 dilution) (Fisher Diagnostics, Orangeburg, NY, U.S.A.) were assessed by measurement of ^H-thymidine incorporation. Natural killer cell activity was assayed by measuring release of ^' Cr from labelled K562 tumour targets at a 30: i mononuclear cell to tumour cell ratio. These methods have been described in detail previously.\"^ Control values were normal laboratory ranges (mean + 2 standard deviations, or in the case of blastogenic responses, lowest to highest values) obtained from healthy individuals.
