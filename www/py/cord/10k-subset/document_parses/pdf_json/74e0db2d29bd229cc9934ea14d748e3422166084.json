It is composed of a highly conserved N-terminal region, which is homological to group-1 cystatin, and a repetitive peptide at the C-terminus. The purified recombinant proteins of tarocystatin, such as full-length (FL), N-terminus (Nt) and C-terminus (Ct) peptides, were produced and their inhibitory activities against papain as well as their antifungal effects were investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that FL peptide exhibited mixed type inhibition (K ia = 0.098 lm and K ib = 0.252 lm) and Nt peptide showed competitive inhibition (K i = 0.057 lm), whereas Ct peptide possessed weak papain activation properties. A shift in the inhibitory pattern from competitive inhibition of Nt peptide alone to mixed type inhibition of FL peptide implied that the Ct peptide has an regulatory effect on the function of FL peptide. Based on the inhibitory kinetics of FL (group-2) and Nt (group-1) peptides on papain activity, an inhibitory mechanism of group-2 phytocystatins and a regulatory mechanism of extended Ct peptide have each been proposed. By contrast, the antifungal activity of Nt peptide appeared to be greater than that of FL peptide, and the Ct peptide showed no effect on antifungal activity, indicating that the antifungal effect is not related to proteinase inhibitory activity. The results are valid for most phytocystatins with respect to the inhibitory mechanism against cysteine proteinase. they are usually 12-16 kDa in size and show high homology with chicken egg white cystatin [4] . The group-2 phytocystatins are approximately or greater than 23 kDa, such as those found in cabbage [5] , soybean [6] , taro [7] , sesame [8] and strawberry [9] . They have a highly conserved N-terminal region, which is similar to that in group-1, and are tailed by a repetitive peptide at the C-terminus, in which variation is possibly caused by gene duplication [10] . The third group of phytocystatins, group-3, is found in potato [11] and tomato [12] , and includes an 80 kDa multi-cystatin with eight cystatin domains. Phytocystatins show variable expression patterns during plant development and defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses [13] [14] [15] .

This crop, especially Kaohsiung No. 1, is popular for its high productivity and lower susceptibility to pathogens. It might be expected that such taro corms display the characteristic mechanisms regulating protein turnover, as well as defense barriers towards pathogens. In a preliminary survey of proteinase inhibitors from taro tuber, copious amount of a cysteine proteinase inhibitor were discovered [7] . Recently, we isolated a group-2 phytocystatin from taro corms, named CeCPI, and demonstrated its anti-papain activity as well as anti-fungal activity [7] . In the alignment data, we also found that the group-2 phytocystatin is like a group-1 phytocystatin with the addition of a C-terminal extension. Moreover, the C-terminal region of the group-2 phytocystatin shares a high consensus sequence among the discovered species [7] . The C-terminal part is probably responsible for regulating inhibitory activity and target specificity. To obtain a better understanding of the structure and biochemical function of tarocystatin CeCPI, we amplified separately the intact full length (FL), N-terminal region (Nt) and C-terminal region (Ct) peptides by PCR and studied their relationship by in-gel anti-papain activity, inhibitory patterns and anti-fungal activity. Based on a comparative study of group-1 (Nt peptide) and group-2 (FL peptide), we discuss the inhibitory mechanism of group-2 phytocystatins and their evolutionary significance.

K ia is described as the dissociation of inhibitor from enzyme, whereas K ib is for that between the inhibitor and enzyme-substrate complex. A prominent characteristic of mixed inhibition compared to competitive inhibition is that the mixed inhibitors bind to enzymes as well as enzyme-substrate complexes, but competitive inhibitors bind only enzymes. Thus, the Ct peptide of tarocystatin may be able to dock onto the papain structure when the active site is occupied by a substrate. Furthermore, the occurrence of the K ib value is always tailed with an unknown regulatory effect, indicating that the Ct peptide functions to alter the target protein conformation and prevent product formation. The Nt peptide functions like the entire OC-I and confers tarocystatin with an affinity for the competing active site. The 3D structural model of tarocystatin was predicted to infer the interaction between group-2 tarocystatin and papain. The Ct peptide sequence shares 48% identity and 68% similarity with taro Nt (1-97 amino acids), as solved by NMR spectroscopy [22] . Although there was no established template for Ct peptide 3D structure prediction, it shares 13% identity and 38% similarity to group-1 OC-I (Fig. 5 ). Therefore, the Ct peptide structure was predicted using secondary structure estimation and a folding pattern simulation program with pseudo-energy minimization. Subsequently, the entire tarocystatin 3D structure was obtained by combining the structures of two segments. Its conformation resembled an earphone comprising two solid masses and a linear structure (Fig. 6) . A highly structural similarity between the Nt and Ct peptides was found and, presumably, the Ct peptide compete with the Nt peptide for binding to the active site (Fig. 6) . However, the assay using varied concentrations in the range 0-10 000 lm of Ct peptide to compete with the Nt peptide at a concentration of 62.5 lm did not demonstrate that the Ct peptide reduced the inhibitory capacity of the Nt peptide (Fig. 7A) .

Moreover, the Ct peptide of the group-2 phytocystatin shares a high consensus sequence among the discovered species [7] . Both the FL and Nt peptides exhibit a good inhibitory property on papain activity, whereas the Ct peptide exhibited papain activation that was also evident in an in-gel inhibitory assay (Fig. 1C) . The inhibition constant demonstrated that the FL peptide exhibited mixed inhibition, and the Nt peptide exhibited competitive inhibition, suggesting a canonical binding mode as with many other group-1 phytocystatin species previously reported ( Table 2 ). The enhancement of the proteinase activity by 18% (Table 1) implicates that the interaction between papain and the Ct peptide possesses refolding in the conformation change of the papain protein. The mixed type inhibition against papain by the FL peptide might be due to the presence of the Ct peptide, which plays an activation role on papain when used alone. Therefore, the mechanism of the Ct peptide with respect to enhancing papain activity presumably involves allosterically binding adjacent to the active \u2044 substrate binding site and altering the papain conformation to be more accessible for the substrate, which is defined as the 'noncanonical' binding mode, where these inhibitory characteristics are quite different from the 'canonical' binding mode of group-1 phytocystatins, as noted previously [23] . This change may also shift the orientation of the Nt peptide to bind with competitive inhibition and result in blocking the substrate from the approaching catalytic site. When the Ct peptide was bound to papain and linked with the Nt peptide, substrates still had the chance to bind to the active cleft. Nevertheless, the Nt peptide was so close to active cleft that allows Nt peptide binding prior to any approaching substrates. Thus, the enhancing effect of the Ct peptide was followed by an immediate binding of the Nt peptide. In this case, substrates still could reach the active cleft and be trapped by some inner pulling force, but could not be fixed in the catalytic site that the Nt peptide blocked. This mechanism was like a noncompetitive inhibition, where substrates could bind to the enzyme-inhibitor complex but not to be turned to products. However, if the Nt peptide bound to papain before the Ct peptide, tarocystatin would simply exhibit competitive inhibition. The alternative binding pattern strongly supports the idea that tarocystatin is a mixed type inhibitor, and provides evidence for the difference between group-1 and group-2 phytocystatins. Phytocystatin has been known for its defense function against attack by insects and pathogens. These proteins have received much attention from researchers due to their potential utilization as bioinsectides in agrobiotechnology [3, 4] . To extend our previous study on antifungal activity [7] , a bioassay on mycelial growth of S. rolfsii was performed, and revealed that the FL and Nt peptides exhibited apparent antifungal activity at a concentration above 3.4 nm, but no significant antifungal activity was observed for the Ct peptide ( Fig. 2A,B) . Microscopic observations indicated that the Nt peptide appeared to be stronger than FL peptide (Fig. 2B) . Because the Ct peptide alone does not show any antifungal effect, this implies that the antifungal activity might be connected to the Nt peptide conformation. A reduction of antifungal activity in vitro by FL peptide may be due to a molecular mass difference. It has been speculated that the FL peptide is larger than the Nt peptide, making it more inefficient to diffuse inside hyphal cells. The true mechanism responsible for the antifungal activity of tarocystatin still requires further investigation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1575, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2976, "end": 2979, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2982, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3037, "end": 3040, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 495, "end": 504, "text": "(Fig. 1C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 752, "end": 759, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 813, "end": 822, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3288, "end": 3298, "text": "Fig. 2A,B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3396, "end": 3405, "text": "(Fig. 2B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To date, the physiological significance of the Ct peptide remains unknown.

Our findings focused on the Ct peptide on cysteine protease, which may function with three roles: (a) to endow the N-terminal domain with more specificity and inhibition to papain; (b) to prevent the N-terminal domain from rapid digestion by endogenous or exogenous peptidase; and (c) to enrich its molecular size as an ideal storage protein.

The band brightness is proportioned to papain activity Samples containing FL or Nt peptides reduce the brightness on the gel, indicating their inhibitory capacity. By contrast, the Ct peptide showed an enhancing capacity. (D) In-gel inhibitory activity assay for varied concentrations of the Ct peptide. The brightness of the band increased with increasing Ct peptide concentration, confirming its enhancing capacity.
