In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver-kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. Methods: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. Results: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver-kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14. 0% (27/194) ]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. Conclusions: Liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the INTRODUCTION Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are rare inborn errors of metabolism presenting in infancy with episodes of metabolic acidosis that can lead to early mortality and significant morbidity [1] [2] [3] .

In general, liver transplantation is deemed to be a suitable treatment option for patients with PA and those patients with MMA but without renal impairment. In contrast, combined liver-kidney transplantation is considered more suitable in those patients with MMA and renal impairment. In addition, it is important to recognise the indications and contraindications for the use of transplantation in PA/MMA. Traditionally, transplants have been reserved for the most 'brittle' patient, in whom it is difficult to achieve reasonable metabolic control or that their dietary restriction is very severe and still not achieving metabolic control. More recently, there has been a tendency to transplant at an earlier stage, regardless of the level of metabolic control. One reason behind this approach is the increased availability of transplant units.

Current Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines for the management of PA and MMA recommend that liver and/or kidney transplantation should be considered in patients with frequent metabolic decompensations where the clinical condition is difficult to stabilise with dietary/pharmacological treatment [1] .

However, the small amount of enzyme activity gained by kidney transplantation appears sufficient to improve the metabolic balance in patients with MMA [1] .

For example, high-level expertise of the transplant team and transplant centre has the potential to reduce post-operative mortality and an experienced team would also recognise that patients with PA/MMA undergoing transplantation would need careful and prolonged management following surgery. As such, the transplant team should aim to work closely with the metabolic team to support the optimal peri-and post-operative management of the patient's primary metabolic disorder, be it PA or MMA.

Extra-hepatic risks remain following surgery in patients with PA and MMA, with transplantation simply aiming to provide a milder and more manageable phenotype of the disease. Patients will therefore be required to remain on a protein-restricted diet, albeit a less stringent one.

However, any benefits of transplantation must always be weighed against the risks associated with organ transplantation along with the need for long-term immunosuppression [1, 36] . Toxicity associated with the use of post-transplantation immunosuppressive agents does occur, e.g. cyclosporine A and tacrolimus-induced leukoencephalopathy is a significant complication which may occur at therapeutic levels [53] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 375, "end": 378, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The findings from the current narrative review are in line with preliminary findings from a recent systematic review of the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA.

The search strategy used for this review identified 70 suitable references comprising both abstracts and full papers, although the available level of patient information, assessed clinical parameters, and clinical outcomes varied between them. All references were crosschecked to avoid any possible duplication of data between abstracts and full papers, although this was limited by the lack of patient information and clinical data provided in some of the abstracts meaning that the total number of transplants performed was actually lower than that reported. A number of these references were pooled studies of metabolic disease wherein only a few patients had PA or MMA. In addition, duration of follow-up varied substantially between studies, with some studies not providing timings of follow-up or complications, and some clinical outcomes of baseline parameters were not reported. For deaths related to transplantation, some references, particularly abstracts, failed to provide full details of the cause of these deaths, which was typically compounded by a lack of specific patient information. Likewise, for complications of transplantation surgery, some studies specifically defined and assessed complications, while others failed to do so, or failed to provide specific patient details, leaving the reader to subjectively interpret any issues related to the transplantation procedure. For this reason, the overall data included in this review should simply be used as a guide to the current issues related to transplantation in patients with PA and MMA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, while the use of liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, this approach does not provide a metabolic cure and patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantationrelated complications. Any transplantation procedure also has an associated mortality risk. Thus, all treatment avenues should ideally be exhausted for PA/MMA before selecting transplantation.
