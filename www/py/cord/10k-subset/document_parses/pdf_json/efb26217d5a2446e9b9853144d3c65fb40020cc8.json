In this chapter we focus on a specific classofviral subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure ofvirus particles and thus preserves the native antigenic conformation ofthe immunogenic proteins. Thesevirus-likeparticles (VLPs) have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses, and have unique advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches.

Thus the vaccine stimulates the body's natural defensesagainst disease through use of a benign 'decoy' that mimics the virulent pathogen. The more similar a vaccine is to the natural disease, the better the immune response to the pathogen on subsequent exposure. In general, resistance to virus infection depends on the development ofan immune response to antigens present on the surface ofvirions or virus-infected cells. Therefore identification ofprotective antigens is the first step in the development ofeffectiveviral vaccines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Currently many successfulviral vaccines have been developed and are in use. These vaccines are predominantly based on live attenuated or inactivated viruses. The live attenuated vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, smallpox, varicella and yellow fever are a weakened form ofthe \"wild\" viruses. These attenuated virus vaccines rely on limited replication ofthe virus in the host following vaccination. Immune responses induced are similar to those from natural infections and often these vaccines are effective after a single dose. However, such vaccines may cause severe reactions in some patients, which are ofien the result ofthe limited replication ofthe att enuated virus following vaccination. In contrast to attenuated live virus vaccines, inactivated (or killed) vaccines can not replicate, as their genetic material or overall structure are purposefully destroyed. These vaccines are safer than live vaccines but generally not as effective, Thesevaccines are madeaswhole cellvaccines (suchasInfluenza,polio,rabiesand hepatitisA) or asfractionalor subunit vaccines such ashepatitisB. Subunit vaccines are basedon the delivery of only a limited number of viral proteins,often the major protein in the capsidor envelope that is sufficient to conferprotectiveimmunity. Thesevaccines arean incrementalstep saferthan inactivated vaccines becausesubunit vaccines can be prepared independent to the culture of replicating virus. Indeed, any remaining possibilityof incomplete inactivation or batch to batch variation in the safetyof the vaccineis eliminated. However, subunit vaccines havetraditionally suffered from one important drawback; often singleproteins when expressed and purified in the absence ofother viral componentsare less immunogenicthan those that areincorporated into infectious virus.Thisisprobablybecause a proportion of this protein ispresentin a misfoldedconformation relative to the nativeprotein. Thus, more doseswith higher amounts of antigen are required to achievethe samelevel ofprotection. A majoradvance in subunit immunogenproduction hasbeen assembly ofproteinsasvirus-like particles (VLPs) usingprotein expression technologyin yeast, insect or mammalian cells. VLPs are a highly effective type of subunit vaccines that mimic the overallstructure of virus particles without any requirement that they contain infectiousgeneticmaterial.

However, an important point remains that the structure of the target virion is not limiting to the successofVLP production. Although various expression systems have been employed for VLP production, this chapter will mainly focus on insect cell culture produced VLPs that are being developed as candidate vaccines.
