One of these developed a papular rash, which may have been drug related, as symptoms disappeared after the withdrawal of medication. Otherwise dichloroflavan treatment seemed to be completely without side-effects. Eight hours after an oral dose of 1 mg/kg, the mean plasma concentration of dichlorofIavan was still more than 4 times the ICs0 for HI, V9 as determined by plaque reduction assay (1) , and the ICs0 for Ht~V9 was exceeded in the plasma of 25 of the 26 volunteers taking drug. Previous pharmacokinetic studies in human volunteers indicated that plasma concentrations well in excess of the IC50 would have been present for most of the dosing period (3). However, when the quantitative clinical and laboratory data from volunteers taking diehloroflavan were compared with those from a placebo group, which had a similar susceptibility to the challenge virus, no beneficial effect of the drug could be demonstrated. Dichloroflavan could not be detected in respiratory secretions after oral dosing, which suggests that adequate concentrations of compound do not become available at the site of virus replication, the eiliated epithelium of the nose. However, the possibility that dichloroflavan might be present in inhibitory quantities in respiratory epithelial tissues but not be secreted remains.

Therefore, reproducible but lesser reductions in these variables could have been missed. However, in the conditions under which it was tested, diehloroflavan failed to produce a consistent reduction in any of the quantitative indices of rhinovirus infection. This finding, combined with the lack of a negative correlation between any of these quantitative indices and plasma concentrations of drug leads us to conclude that the formulation of diehtoroflavan tested is of no value in the treatment of human rhinovirus infection. However, the effectiveness of other formulations and routes of administration remains to be tested. In particular, intranasal administration may prove effective.",
