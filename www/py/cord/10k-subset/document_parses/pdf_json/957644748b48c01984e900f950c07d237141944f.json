The spread of these diseases depends on a vector that transmits a parasite to humans, and in some cases, to animals. The vector is an infected female mosquito. The dynamics of the human-vector interaction can be summarized as follows. An infected vector, whose saliva contains the parasite, transmits the latter to a human host through a bite. Once in the host, the parasite passes through several stages, until it migrates to the red blood cells. A vector can become infected upon biting an infected host. Within the vector, the parasite also undergoes several phases and finally migrates to the salivary glands, repeating the cycle.",

The critical parameter k c separates the two possible steady states the system can reach asymptotically, namely a disease-free or absorbing state and a surviving epidemic or active state, in which the stationary density of infected individuals, q, is nonzero. It turns out that k c marks a continuous phase transition. Because q is zero in one phase and is greater than zero in the other, it can be identified as the order parameter of the transition, just as the magnetization is the order parameter for a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition. At a continuous phase transition the order parameter increases continuously from zero as the infection parameter is increased beyond its critical value.

Thus if there are N 1 infected sites, the total transition rate is r \u00bc N 1 \u00f01 \u00fe k\u00de, which means that the time s to the next event is an exponentially distributed random variable, p\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc re \u00c0rs . In many cases, we simply replace the random variable s by its mean, 1=r, and advance the time counter by this amount at each step. 22 To decide where the event will take place, we choose one of the N 1 currently infected sites at random, say j, by randomly generating an integer uniformly distributed between 1 and N 1 . To choose the type of event, we note that a given event is recovery with probability p d \u00bc 1=\u00f01 \u00fe k\u00de and is an infection attempt with the complementary probability, 1 \u00c0 p d . Thus, we generate a uniform random number y in the interval [0,1) and recover the chosen site j if y < p d . If y ! p d , we choose one of the z j nearest neighbors of site j and infect this site if it is currently uninfected. (If the chosen neighbor is already infected, no changes are made to the configuration at this step.) Whenever the configuration changes, the list of infected sites must be updated. Despite a small overhead associated with maintaining the list, this algorithm provides a highly efficient method for simulating the contact process.",

Although the continuous-time algorithm is more faithful to the original Markov process, the discrete time implementation is more efficient computationally. The results of the two approaches agree qualitatively but differ somewhat in details. Because there is usually significant uncertainty regarding the true values of the parameters (transition rates) used in the model, the differences between predictions furnished by the two simulation strategies may not be important. Therefore qualitative results on, say, how to reduce the likelihood of a large epidemic may be of more utility than precise numerical predictions.",

Compare the values obtained for the survival probability P(t) at different times with the reference values shown in Table I . (2) Suppose that due to changes in topography or settlement density, the distance between human host habitations varies in space. We will represent each habitation by a lattice site and represent this situation by a positiondependent diffusion rate, with larger separations corresponding to smaller rates. Adapt the algorithms we have described to the case of a site-dependent diffusion rate D i . To model heavily and sparsely populated regions, for example, D i could take two values, generating clumps of sites with the same value. Determine in which regions the epidemic is more likely to persist, and where the density of infected hosts and vectors is greatest. (3) The algorithms we have described require that a new realization be started each time the absorbing state is reached. A useful alternative, especially in the vicinity of the critical point, is quasistationary simulation, in which the absorbing state is effectively removed from the state space. The method is described in detail in Ref. 25 . Here, we simply provide a recipe, which runs as follows. We maintain a collection of N s saved configurations, starting from the initial one (which might have all hosts and vectors infected). In the initial phase of the simulation, we save the current configuration to the list at each time step.",

(The replacement probability p r is determined by the condition that the residence time, N s =p r of a configuration on the list be long compared to the mean lifetime of the process, yet short compared to the duration of the simulation.) The evolution of the process proceeds as before, except when an absorbing configuration is reached. In this case, the latter is exchanged for one of the saved configurations, which, by construction, is active. Following an initial transient, this modified process attains the quasistationary distribution; that is, the probability distribution conditioned on not having visited the absorbing state. Averages over this distribution correspond to asymptotic long-time properties of the active process and may be used to infer the critical properties. Use quasistationary simulations to determine the infected host and vector densities as a function of one of the parameters. Convenient values for the quasistationary scheme are N s \u00bc 1000 and p r \u00bc 0:001.",
