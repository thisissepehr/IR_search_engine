We investigated the influence of exogenous NO on airway responsiveness to acetylcholine aerosols (ACH) in normal and in hyperresponsive rabbits. White New Zealand rabbits were anesthetized, intubated, and breathed room air spontaneously. Responses of respiratory parameters in ACH challenge tests were measured. In group A the influence of NO on ACH infusioninduced airway constriction was measured. Airway responses to aerosols from 0.25 to 8.0% ACH solutions in saline were measured with 150 and 300 ppm NO inhalation (groups B and C) and compared with the same animals' responses without NO. Moreover, we examined the influence of NO synthase inhibition on airway responsiveness (group D) and the modulatory effect of NO in hyperresponsive animals (group E). 300 ppm NO inhalation significantly decreased the bronchoconstrictor response to intravenously administered ACH (group A). However, the baseline value of dynamic elastance (E dyn ) was only marginally lower under the influence of 300 ppm NO. During inhalation of 150 or 300 ppm NO, responses to nebulized 2.0% and less ACH solutions remained nearly unaltered. Responses to aerosols of 4.0 and 8.0% diminished significantly (groups B and C). Following 40 min of aerosolized N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) solution (a NO synthase inhibitor, 1.2 mM) inhalation, the response of E dyn to ACH increased significantly in group D. In group E, animals inhaled 500 mg/m 3 ammonium persulfate (APS), an oxidant with various industrial applications, after the first ACH challenge test (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0% ACH).

NO has many clinical applications including the normalization of pulmonary vascular pressure in newborns with severe persistent hypertension [10, 20] and in the treatment of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6, 18, 22, 23] . In addition, it serves as vasodilator in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [21] . Current data suggest that inhalation of nitric oxide by patients with mild asthma during methacholine-induced bronchospasm results in a minor but significant relaxation of airway tone [9] . NO is produced in different cell types during the NO synthase-catalyzed conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase, and the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate causes a relaxation of smooth muscles. Applying an inhibitor of NO synthase, N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME), blocks NO production [1] .",

[7] demonstrated the contribution of a NO deficiency in the respiratory epithelium in the development of virus-induced AHR. Using our rabbit model for occupational lung diseases [11, 12] , we investigated the influence of exogenous NO on bronchoconstrictor responses to acetylcholine (ACH). We then examined the influence of NO synthase inhibition (L-NAME) on AR to ACH. Finally, the influence of NO inhalation on the constrictor response to ACH in hyperresponsive animals was tested. AHR was induced by exposure to ammonium persulfate (APS), a potent oxidant used in numerous industrial bleaching processes and in the hair cosmetic industry as a component of hair bleach powders. The substance is suspected to cause lung diseases after exposure in the workplace [2, 5] . Indeed, APS in a concentration of 50 mg/m 3 in the air caused AHR after an exposure of 4 h in our rabbit model for occupational lung diseases [13] [14] [15] .",

            "text": "Our experiments confirm the protective effects of 300 and 150 ppm NO on ACHinduced bronchoconstrictions. However, the problem of NO toxicity cannot be ignored. The development of nitrates and peroxynitrites resulting in methemoglobinemia or nitrogen dioxide having a toxic effect on lung tissue may explain the toxic effect of higher NO concentrations [1, 3, 16] . For this reason, the application of higher NO concentrations should be limited to therapeutic use and only applied over short periods of time. Additionally, many studies demonstrate an effective therapeutic use of NO in lower concentrations [9, 10, 27] , avoiding the toxic effects. For this reason, future experiments should clarify in detail whether low and thus less toxic NO concentrations can be used effectively in the prevention or treatment of acute airway constrictions.",

After inhibiting the NOS by using the potent NOS inhibitor L-NAME, constrictor airway responses to ACH increased significantly. Moreover, the constrictor responses to ACH in hyperresponsive rabbits decreased under the influence of exogenous NO. The present investigation confirms the modulating influence of NO on AR, especially after induction of AHR by exposure to an occupational irritant.",
