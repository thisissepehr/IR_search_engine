The bets effect was not attenuated by Study 4's instructions to think about what would be purchased with bet winnings. Task results combined with free-response coding supported the notion that highly numerate participants have a systematic and persistent inclination for doing simple and complex number operations that drive their judgments (even after controlling for nonnumeric intelligence).

KEYWORDS cognitive operations, judgment, individual differences, objective numeracy, preference construction 1 | INTRODUCTION It is often assumed that human beings \"have\" preferences for objects and attributes and their choices reflect these preferences. Psychologists, however, have convincingly demonstrated that preferences are not always stable and, instead, are \"constructed\" from information available in the judgment or decision context (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 2006 ). In a classic example, participants shown two gambles, one with a higher probability to win and the other with a higher amount to win, tended to choose the higher probability gamble but were willing to pay more for the gamble with the higher winning amount (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 1971 ). In the present paper, we examined another gamble task in which decision makers judge the attractiveness of a single gamble, either with or without a small loss, but otherwise identical. The bet with the small loss is objectively worse but judged as more attractive on average (hereafter called the \"bets effect\"). However, only some judges (the highly numerate) demonstrate this puzzling effect, which we propose as evidence for a systematic information processing inclination that is revealed in the judgment process. This inclination produces more preference construction among those with fewer cognitive constraints, contrary to prior thinking about preference construction being more likely with more constraints.",

The results were anomalous from the perspective of economic theory as mean ratings of the superior No-Loss and inferior Loss gambles were, respectively, 9.4 and 14.9, that is, the \"bets effect.\" The effect cannot be explained by averaging (i.e., a choice option may be evaluated as the average of its components) because averaging predicts that adding a 5\u00a2 loss to an option with positive payoffs would make it less attractive (Anderson, 1974; Troutman & Shanteau, 1976) . Instead, the effect appeared due to feelings about the $9 that emerged from judges comparing the $9 with the 5\u00a2 loss in the Loss condition and deriving more positive affect to the $9; no such comparison was available in the No-Loss condition.",

In multiple studies, they replicated the bets effect and the small loss's impact on affect to the $9. They also demonstrated that probabilities were easier to evaluate than monetary outcomes for simple gambles such as that in the No-Loss condition. In particular, they suggested that probabilities carry a more precise impression and are weighted more in judgments than monetary payoffs because probabilities are on a bounded scale that allows them to be evaluated as good versus bad without other context whereas a payoff such as $9 is relatively abstract and difficult to evaluate (to feel how good or bad it is) in the absence of a comparison.

In addition, preference construction generally happens more among individuals who lack experience or familiarity with attributes or options (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 2006; Payne et al., 1999) . Instead, not only did the effect occur more in populations with fewer cognitive constraints (the highly numerate, Studies 1-4) but it occurred as much or more among highly numerate accountants and actuaries (Studies 1-2) who averaged many years of experience in their respective fields (32.5 and 16.6 years, respectively) and therefore with the monetary outcomes and probabilities critical to the judgment. The accountants, and especially the actuaries, have extensive experience with similar \"bets\" in the real world.

These results point towards the existence and importance of a more general number operation inclination among the highly numerate that is critical to the bet's attractiveness and is consistent with prior research (Cokely & Kelley, 2009; Peters & Bjalkebring, 2015) . Study 4 results demonstrated that the highly numerate's number comparison inclination was persistent in the face of instructions to consider an alternative comparison (i.e., instructions to consider what they would do with the $9). Thus, the bets effect generalized beyond a college student population (generalizability is often questioned in psychological studies; Peterson, 2001 ) and appears to be caused by a persistent inclination to compare numbers associated with greater numeric abilities (Studies 1-4) and instruction (Study 3).",

More and less objectively numerate women responded similarly as if all individuals had compared the two numbers. Such lack of a numeracy effect could be due to these probabilities being easier to evaluate (similar to the ease of processing probabilities in the bets task). We think it more likely that health motivation played a role and that all women were powerfully motivated to understand their personal risk. Findings such as these may help researchers to identify boundary conditions so that we can better understand the conditions under which more and less numerate individuals compare versus do not compare numbers. In the present bets task, the highly numerate were more likely to; the less numerate, however, could when instructed in Study 3. Identifying boundary conditions for information processing is important, both theoretically and practically. It seems likely that differentiation by numeracy will occur more often when motivation is low, comparisons are not salient, and attentional resources are limited (Gilbert, Pelham, & Krull, 1988) . Additional research in the present bets task and other tasks should examine these issues further.",

            "text": "Numeracy research has sometimes been described within a dual-process theory framework (Peters, 2012; Reyna et al., 2009) . Not all dual-process models are identical, however, and they make some different predictions, particularly with respect to two questions important to the present bets effect. First, the theories differ in terms of which process is thought to produce superior decisions. Popular default-interventionist theories (also called serial-interventionist models) assume that the intuitive System 1 process provides generally reasonable default responses that guide behavior; the deliberative System 2 then may detect an error and override the intuition, replacing it with a better, reflective response (e.g., Kahneman, 2003; Stanovich, 2009; Stanovich & West, 2000) . Thus, the deliberative process produces superior judgments and decisions. Because numeracy is considered a deliberative process and greater numeracy is associated with a greater nonnormative bets effect, default-interventionist theories are inconsistent with these findings. The effect, however, is consistent with fuzzy trace theory (FTT; Reyna, Lloyd, & Brainerd, 2003; Reyna et al., 2009 ) as well as interactive dual-process theories (cognitive-experiential self-theory, Epstein, 1994 Epstein, , 2000 affect heuristic, Slovic et al., 2002; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004 ) that have sometimes been grouped incorrectly with default-interventionist theories (e.g., Reyna et al., 2009) . Both types of dual-process theories allow for better or worse decisions to emerge from either process. Epstein (2000) , for example, states \"This is not meant to suggest that the [deliberative] mind is always superior. The inferential, [deliberative] mind and the learning, experiential mind each has its advantages and disadvantages\" (p. 671).",

Descriptively, examination of Table 2 reveals that the actuaries rated both Loss and No-Loss bets as more attractive than Peters et al.'s (2006) highly numerate undergraduates and showed a mean bets effect that was larger than the undergraduates (about a 5-point difference for the actuaries vs. a 3-point difference among highly numerate undergraduates). Similar to prior results with highly numerate undergraduates, the loss's presence caused the affective meaning of the $9 to change, even among highly experienced actuaries; the $9 win felt better in the presence versus absence of the loss, mean affect = 1.68 and 0.53, respectively, t(77) = 3.98, p < .001. 1",

The results with actuaries and accountants clearly indicated otherwise. Their substantially greater expertise with monetary outcomes and probabilities (as compared with prior samples), however, did not protect them from demonstrating the bets effect. We conclude that both actuaries and accountants have a stable inclination, based on their high numeric abilities, to do number operations such as the hypothesized comparison process of the present bets effect. Nonetheless, some questions remain. The actuaries' free responses did not point directly to the hypothesized number comparison process (although their more positive affect to the $9 in the presence versus absence of the loss was consistent with it). Also unclear was whether less numerate populations cannot show the bets effect due to their lower ability, or whether they can be encouraged to attend to and/or compare the monetary outcomes and thereby show the bets effect.",

Instead, the evidence is consistent with the highly numerate comparing outcomes, which leads to the inferior judgment (although it could be argued that the small loss allowed the highly numerate to recognize the goodness of this positive expected value bet).6.1 | Implications of a number comparison inclination beyond the bets taskAlthough deliberating more with numbers is generally thought to help the highly numerate make better choices and experience better outcomes, the highly numerate also may \"overuse\" number operations and show results that appear less rational. Besides the present bets effect, inKleber, Dickert, Peters, and Florack's (2013) Study 2, participants read about five children at risk of starvation and asked how much they would be willing to donate to help them. In three between-subjects conditions, the researchers manipulated the reference group size (no reference group, out of 10 children, out of 1000 children). More numerate individuals (but not the less numerate) were willing to donate more in response to the smaller reference group (and greater proportional help) as if they had calculated donation effectiveness (i.e., I could help 50% [or 0.5%] of the children at risk) despite the fact that their donation would always help exactly five children.",

The less numerate were not affected by the small loss and were never more likely than the highly numerate in Study 3 to give any coded response. They may have found the bet more attractive with Study 4's instruction to consider what they would do with their winnings; however, although the interaction of instruction with numeracy was significant, the effect on the less numerate (based on a median split) was marginal and the interaction effect was nonsignificant after controlling for shared variance between numeracy and vocabulary, nonnumeric reasoning, and NFC. Past literature points towards the less numerate relying more on simpler and often nonnumeric information in judgments (e.g., incidental emotions) whereas the more numerate use concurrently presented numbers instead(Traczyk & Fulawka, 2016). In the present task, the less numerate may have formed their attractiveness ratings by thinking about what they might purchase with their winnings, current mood states, or reliance on single attributes such as the possibility of winning or a priori preferences for gambling in general.",
