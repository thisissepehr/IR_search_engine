Symptoms are nonspecific and may affect multiple organs, including the central nervous system. Neuroimaging findings have been described in case reports and small series; body imaging findings have not been described extensively. Objective: To summarize findings of the most frequently performed imaging studies of the brain, chest and abdomen in patients with HLH. Materials and methods: Retrospective review of chest radiographs and CT, abdominal ultrasound and CT, brain CT and MRI, skeletal surveys, and autopsy data. Results: Twentyfive patients were diagnosed and treated for HLH at our institution over an 11-year period; 15 patients (60%) died. Common chest radiograph findings included alveolarinterstitial opacities with pleural effusions, often with rapid evolution and resolution. Hepatosplenomegaly, gallbladder wall thickening, hyperechoic kidneys and ascites were common abdominal findings, which resolved after therapy in some cases. Brain-imaging studies revealed nonspecific periventricular white-matter abnormalities, brain-volume loss and enlargement of extra-axial fluid spaces. Three infant cases, one with intracranial hemorrhage, one with multiple pathologic rib fractures and one with diaphyseal periosteal reaction involving multiple long bones on skeletal survey, raised suspicion of child abuse at presentation. Abuse was not substantiated in any case. Conclusions: Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the radiographic manifestations of HLH, which are nonspecific and overlap with infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Findings in the chest (similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome) and abdomen may progress rapidly and then regress with institution of appropriate anti-HLH therapy. CNS findings may be progressive. In some infants, initial imaging findings may mimic nonaccidental trauma.",

Both primary (familial) and secondary forms of the disease exist [2] . The familial form is autosomal recessive or X-linked in origin and generally occurs in infancy, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 50,000 live births [3] . Secondary HLH has been associated with infection (viral, particularly herpesviruses EBV and CMV; bacterial, fungal, tuberculosis), T-cell type maligancies and prolonged immunosuppression [3, 4, 5] . A classification of the histiocytosis syndromes is included in Table 1 [6] .",

Eleven (44%) of the patients were Hispanic, eight (32%) were Caucasian and three (12%) each were of African-American or Asian descent. Cases were considered familial if there was a history of parental consanguinuity or diagnosis of a sibling with HLH. Five cases were familial in origin (one also with parainfluenza-3); a preceding immunologic abnormality or infectious etiology (four EBV, two adenovirus, one rotavirus and one Kawasaki disease) could be identified in eight secondary cases. Twenty-one patients received the HLH-94 protocol (or equivalent) chemotherapy; one required splenectomy for massive splenic enlargement. Eight patients underwent bonemarrow transplantation (six matched unrelated donor, one matched related donor, one autologous).",

A case of hepatosplenomegly, interstitial pulmonary infiltrates and skin lesions in an infant was described, in which reactive hemophagocytic syndrome developed and congenital tuberculosis was the inciting agent [15] . Gauvin et al [16] have described two cases of reactive hemophagocytic syndrome as a component of multipleorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), characterized by acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, liver dysfunction and septic shock, with pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone-marrow aspirate. Several proinflammatory cytokines are com-mon to both MODS and reactive hemophagocytosis. High levels of cytokines have been identified in serum and pleural fluid of patients with viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome [17] . In our population, the usual progression of radiographic findings began with low lung volumes and central peribronchial interstitial thickening, followed by pulmonary edema and development of airspace disease and pleural effusions, similar to ARDS. An infectious cause was confirmed in a minority of our cases. Pulmonary hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis were frequent findings at autopsy.",

A neuropathology staging system has been developed. No abnormality is evident in stage 0. Stage I findings included focal infiltration of meninges with lymphocytes and histiocytes, with occasional perivascular infiltrate. Perivascular infiltration and meningeal infiltration is more pronounced in stage II, sometimes involving underlying cortex. The most severe findings (stage III) include diffuse infiltration of brain paren-chyma, astrogliosis, white-matter and cortical necrosis, and occasional calcifications [26] .",

The patient with stage-I autopsy findings and one patient with stage-III findings were not imaged. In one patient with stage-III findings at autopsy, ventricular Fig. 6 Chest radiograph in a 3-month-old girl in respiratory distress. Multiple healing rib fractures (6-8 on the left, 6-9 on the right) initially raised concern for nonaccidental trauma. Osteopenia and lucent metaphyses were evident on skeletal survey (patient 16 in Table 2 ) enlargement was present without periventricular whitematter abnormalities on CT 5 weeks prior and MRI 4 weeks prior to death. The remaining patients with stage-III histopathology findings had abnormalities of periventricular white matter on imaging studies. The patient with multiple enhancing hemispheric and posterior fossa lesions on CT and MRI had findings of extensive mononuclear infiltrates and white-matter necrosis at autopsy (stage III) without evidence of tumor or infection. The patient with stage-II pathologic findings had a normal brain CT 1 week prior to death, suggesting rapid progression of HLH. Findings of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy in a 10-yearold girl who survived may reflect the effects of HLH or of cyclosporine, a known cause of this CNS finding [27] . Unlike Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, osseous involvement in HLH has not been described. In the case of the infant with multiple rib fractures, these were likely pathologic because of prolonged hepatic insufficiency; however, diffuse marrow involvement by HLH may represent an additional consideration. At autopsy, a rib was described as normal; the patient had received a bonemarrow transplant. The rib studied at autopsy was not specified. It is customary at this institution to assay the anterior portion of a rib adjacent to the growth plate; fracture sites were at the lateral aspects of the ribs bilaterally. No autopsy was performed in the infant presenting with multiple nonspecific areas of long-bone periosteal reaction.",

Findings in the chest and abdomen may progress and regress rapidly and suggest a common pathway of tissue damage by cytokine overproduction, as found in multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. CNS findings may be progressive and are critical in patient outcome. In infants, initial imaging findings may occasionally mimic nonaccidental trauma. Early diagnosis is essential for institution of appropriate therapy, and understanding of the common findings of HLH may be helpful in this regard.",
