After infection, KO mice showed higher injurious scores in both lung and kidney, and decreased renal function than WT and hTG mice. hTG mice exhibited comparable lung injury but more severe kidney injury compared to WT mice. Increased renal tubular apoptosis, NF-\u03baB activation and proinflammatory cytokines in the kidney of KO mice were found when compared with WT and hTG mice. Furthermore, in vitro primary proximal tubular epithelial cells from KO mice showed more apoptosis with higher level of activated caspase-3 than those from WT mice after LPS treatment.

To determine the role of pulmonary SP-D in pneumonia-induced AKI, firstly we compared bacterial dynamic changes in the lungs of three types (WT, KO, and hTG) of mice at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 h after intratracheal infection of bioluminescent P. aeruginosa by in vivo image method (Fig. 3A) . The results showed that infected KO mice exhibited significantly higher level of bioluminescence than infected WT and hTG mice at 12 h after infection and beyond, but no significant difference was observed between infected WT and hTG mice (Fig. 3B ). Furthermore, a higher rate of mortality in infected KO mice was observed compared to infected WT, but no difference between infected hTG and WT mice (Fig. 3C) . As expected, alveolar macrophages were the predominant cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of all sham groups. SP-D KO mice demonstrate accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages and emphysema in 24-week-old aged mice 30 . Increased number and size of macrophages with occasional multinucleated macrophages as well in BALF of 8-12 weeks old KO sham mice were observed. hTG SP-D mice exhibited similar phenotypes of alveolar macrophages as WT mice, suggesting hSP-D protein expressed in the lung of hTG mice functions and rescues abnormal alveolar macrophages of KO mice (Fig. 4A) . P. aeruginosa infection causes predominant neutrophils in the BALF from three groups of infected mice (Fig. 4A ). The numbers of neutrophils ( Fig. 4B ) and macrophages (Fig. 4C) were higher in the BALF from infected KO mice compared to infected WT and hTG mice, but no significant difference was observed between infected WT and hTG mice (Fig. 4C) .",

Renal histological analysis demonstrated normal kidney architecture in all sham groups, indicating that renal SP-D deficiency did not cause spontaneous renal injury (Fig. 5C ). However, dramatic pathological changes were observed in the kidney from infected mice (Fig. 5C ). Infected KO and hTG mice exhibited more severe kidney damage, characterized by tubular degeneration, loss of brush border and tubular luminal cast formation when compared with infected WT mice (Fig. 5C ). Accordingly, histological analyses of kidney injury indicated more intensive damage with higher renal injury score in infected KO mice compared to infected WT and hTG mice (Fig. 5D) . Furthermore, infected hTG mice had higher renal injury score than infected WT mice (Fig. 5D ). These findings indicated mice lacking pulmonary and/or renal SP-D were more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia-induced AKI. SP-D deficiency increases renal tubular cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. To study the mechanisms underlying the protective role of SP-D in pneumonia/sepsis-induced AKI, we examined apoptotic cells in the kidney of infected and sham WT, KO and hTG mice. As shown in Fig. 6A , terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transsterase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis revealed considerable renal tubular cell apoptosis in infected mice at 48 hours after P. aeruginosa infection, but not in sham mice. Quantitative analysis of TUNEL-positive cells indicated that the numbers of apoptosis in infected KO and hTG mice were significantly larger than that in infected WT mice (Fig. 6B) . We further determined renal distribution and expression of cleaved caspase-3, an activated pro-apoptotic protein of caspase family, which plays a central role in the execution of cell apoptosis 31 . As shown in Fig. 6C , the results of immunohistochemical analysis showed increased levels of activated caspas-3 in renal proximal tubules in the kidneys of infected KO and hTG mice than infected WT mice. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated increased levels of activated caspase-3 protein (17 kDa) in infected KO and hTG mice compared to infected WT mice 48 hours after infection (Fig. 6D ).",

These in vitro data support the in vivo findings that renal SP-D protects from tubular epithelial cells against apoptosis upon LPS treatment. In addition, we examined the effect of exogenous SP-D protein to SP-D KO PTECs after LPS treatment. The results showed that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the conditioned media of LPS-treated KO PTECs in the presence of exogenous SP-D were significantly decreased compared to that in the absence of exogenous SP-D (i.e. IL-6: 335 \u00b1 36 pg/ml vs 421 \u00b1 45 pg/ml; TNF-\u03b1: 189 \u00b1 25 pg/ml vs 278 + 32 pg/ml, p < 0.05, respectively), suggesting that endogenous SP-D in PTECs may interact with LPS through extracellular molecular form.",

Until now there is only limited information about the mechanisms of ALI-induced AKI and the crosstalk between lung and kidney. Little is known about the mechanistic roles of innate immune molecule SP-D, which is expressed in both lung and kidney, in the pathogenesis of ALI-induced AKI. In the present study, we have generated and utilized hTG SP-D mice with lung-specific SP-D expression. With WT and SP-D KO and hTG SP-D mice we have explored the mechanisms underlying the role of pulmonary and renal SP-D in pneumonia-induced AKI. These findings from in vivo study demonstrated that lack of SP-D in lung and/or kidney promotes severe renal injury, tubular cell apoptosis, NF-\u03baB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which consequently results in aggravated lung-kidney crosstalk during pneumonia-induced AKI. Furthermore, in vitro study with isolated primary PTECs demonstrated that SP-D deficient PTECs increases cell sensitivity for apoptosis after treatment with LPS. To our knowledge, this study is the first report to demonstrate that both pulmonary and renal SP-D protects from pneumonia-induced AKI through modulating lung-kidney crosstalk and attenuating renal tubular apoptosis, NF-\u03baB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.",

Singbartl et al. 7 recently reported that the inhalation of P. aeruginosa only causes mild histological changes in the kidneys at 24 h, characterized by hyperemia and tubular edema.

Survival rate in KO mice after infection was accordingly significantly decreased compared to WT mice. However, endotoxemia-induced indirect lung injury showed increased pulmonary inflammation but with a paradoxical decrease in mortality in SP-D KO mice when compared with WT mice 17 . Distinct phenotypes in direct v.s. indirect ALI models may partly explain these different observations. Direct lung injury is characterized by more severe lung epithelial injury and less severe endothelial injury, while the opposite pattern was identified in indirect lung injury 40 . Interestingly, hTG mice had more deteriorated renal function and renal histopathological changes compared with infected WT mice even though they presented similar levels of lung injury, implying the role of renal SP-D itself in attenuating lung-kidney interaction. However, in contrast to the observation in the clinical patients that a modest rise in Scr was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death 41 , the attenuated AKI was not accompanied by significantly improved rate of mortality in infected WT mice than hTG mice, suggesting that other factors may also be involved in the morbidity and mortality of septic animals. In this work we tried to investigate the crosstalk between lung and kidney and the effect of organ-specific expressing SP-D using WT, SP-D KO and hTG SP-D mice in the pneumonia-induced sepsis. Primary injurious organ in this model is the lung due to intratracheal delivery of pathogenic bacteria. The secondary injurious organs, i.e. kidney injury, could be caused by the lack of SP-D expression but it may be influenced by the differential systemic inflammation because of differential lung injury. Renal cell apoptosis is a major pathogenic mechanism leading to acute renal failure in AKI induced by sepsis, renal ischemic injury and nephrotoxins 42 . The involvement of renal cell apoptosis is still controversial in the pathogenesis of lung-kidney crosstalk in response to injury. Distant kidney epithelial cell apoptosis has been found in a rabbit model of acid-aspiration lung injury followed by injurious ventilatory strategies 43 . However, in a two-hit model of AKI and ALI to study kidney-lung cross-talk, only very few and weak apoptotic changes in the kidney were detected after bacterial pneumonia 7 . In the present study, we observed that renal tubular epithelial cells are highly susceptible to undergo apoptotic cell death 48 h after lung infection by markedly increased tubular TUNEL positive cells and activated caspase-3 expression.",

Previous studies have shown that SP-D enhanced the uptake of apoptotic cells by mouse and human alveolar macrophages in vitro and in vivo 19 . SP-D KO mice have five-to tenfold higher level of apoptotic cells in their alveolar spaces and the treatment of these SP-D KO mice with an intratracheally administered human recombinant SP-D resulted in reduced levels of apoptotic cells. The pulmonary inflammation found in SP-D deficient mice might be owing to the fact that apoptotic cells cannot be cleared and they act as pro-inflammatory factors in the alveolar space 45 . In agreement with these reports in the lung, we observed that the frequency of apoptosis and expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the tubules of infected KO mice were significantly higher than those in hTG and WT mice. These findings are also consistent with our previous studies that SP-D played a protective role in sepsis-induced AKI 27 and acute pancreatic injury 46 by modulating renal and pancreatic apoptosis in CLP model. Therefore, these observations support the notion that SP-D deficiency in lung and/or kidney contributes to the aggravated renal tubular apoptosis, and thus causing more severe kidney injury after pulmonary infection. Recently, SP-D is found to suppress extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways of injurious T cells via reduction of caspase-8 activation 47, 48 . In line with this opinion, PTECs lacking SP-D exhibited increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activation and decreased cell viability following LPS treatment.",

Inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling in renal tubular epithelial lead to reduce tubular injury, apoptosis, necrosis, and accumulation of interstitial inflammatory cells, which consequently results in ameliorated kidney damage after ischemic AKI 51 . Lung-kidney crosstalk is related to NF-\u03baB dependent proinflammatory cytokines in the study of rats treated with intratracheal lipopolysaccharide instillation 32 . In this study, the significantly increased renal NF-\u03baB p65 and p-I-\u03baB \u03b1 expression together with elevated renal TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in infected mice have been observed compared to sham mice, which implicated the NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory response indeed involved in the lung-kidney interaction. In contrast, infected KO and hTG mice exhibited aggravated renal NF-\u03baB activation and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines release owing to the lack of lung and/or kidney SP-D expression. It seems to be explained by the 'head or tail hypothesis' presented by Gardai et al. 52 . In normal conditions when sufficient SP-D is available, SP-D binds to the signal inhibitory regulatory protein (SIRP\u03b1) of inflammatory cells via its CRD head to activate anti-inflammatory pathways. When infection occurs, the exposed collagenous tail of SP-D adheres to the calreticulin/CD91 receptor complex and initiates a pro-inflammatory response by stimulating p38 MAPK phyosphorylation and NF-\u03baB activation. A similar dual effect was observed in the promotion or inhibition of apoptosis 53 . Therefore, the lung and kidney SP-D still plays the role of inhibiting inflammation by blocking Toll-like receptor 4 through the CRD 54 to some extent even though they were dramatically reduced in infected WT mice, which resulted in the attenuated lung-kidney crosstalk than in KO or hTG mice.",

In brief, lung and kidney tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as well as aprotinin (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Illkirch, France). After centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were harvested for Western blot analysis. Total protein concentrations of lung and kidney sample were determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Thirty microgram of total proteins for each sample was resolved by reducing, electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The blot was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, and was subsequently incubated with a primary antibody against SP-D, or NF-\u03baB p65 (sc-109, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas), or phosphorylated I-\u03baB \u03b1 (sc-101713, Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, Texas), or cleaved caspase-3 (#9661, Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. A \u03b2-actin antibody (sc-130657, Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, Texas) was used as internal control. Thereafter the membranes were incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The blots were detected using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and exposed to X-ray film (Pierce Biochemicals, FL). The relative expression of protein was quantified by ImageJ software version 1.48 (Wayne Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, MA). For determination of SP-D, human BALF or proteins from lung tissue in sham mouse were used as positive control. In some experiments, blots were stripped to remove antibody by incubation in 2% SDS, 0.06M Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), and 0.72 M 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 \u00b0C, and then reprobed with a second primary antibody 63 .",

Original magnification 400\u00d7. Scale bars = 100 \u03bcm. (D) Quantitative analysis of TUNEL positive PTECs showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic cells/total number of cells per \u00d7400 field) was higher in the KO group than WT group after LPS treatment. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, t test (n = 6/group). Western blot analysis (E) and semi-quantitative analysis (F) of cleaved caspase-3 (17 Kda) expression in the PTECs showed increased expression of 17-KDa caspase-3 in the LPS treated cells with comparison of untreated cells, and the level of cleaved caspased-3 was higher in treated PTECs from KO mice vs. WT mice. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, One-way ANOVA, Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post hoc test (n = 6/group).Scientific RepORtS | (2018) 8:15393 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-33828-7",

The DNA fragment was consisted of a 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter, 1.2-kb human SP-D cDNA, and a 0.4-kb SV40 small t-intron poly(A) sequence. The basic 3.7-hSP-C/SV40 vector was kindly provided by Drs Stephan W. Glasser and Jeffrey A. Whitsett (Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH) 56 . It was demonstrated that the transgene was specifically expressed in the lung under control of the human SP-C promoter 56,57 . The hSP-D cDNA fragment was cloned into the basic 3.7-hSP-C/SV40 vector and the recombinant construct was confirmed Scientific RepORtS | (2018) 8:15393 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-33828-7",
