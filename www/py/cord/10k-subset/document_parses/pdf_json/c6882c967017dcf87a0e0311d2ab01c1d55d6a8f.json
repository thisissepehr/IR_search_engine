We utilized standardized epidemic curves, using 20% and 30% clinical attack rates in 1 wave of illnesses and different levels of clinical severity and assumed that the pandemic began with 100 persons initially infected [11] (Table 1) . For our model, we assumed that 2 doses of vaccine administered 3 weeks apart would be needed to be fully effective, based on data indicating that previous H5 and H7 influenza vaccines have low immunogenicity [15] [16] [17] . We further assumed that, during a pandemic with moderate or high mortality, demand for vaccine would be such that 80% of the US population would receive 2 doses of vaccine. We prioritized persons returning for their second dose of vaccine over persons who were receiving their first dose. We also assumed that vaccine was allocated in a pattern similar to the doses administered among 4 age groups (6 months-9 years, 10-19 years, 20-59 years, and \u226560 years) during the 2012-2013 influenza season [18] (Table 1) . Once 80% of an age group was fully vaccinated, we assumed vaccination would end in that age group. Remaining vaccine would then be allocated to other age groups until they reached 80% coverage. We allowed for a 2-week delay in protection against the virus after administration of the second dose of the vaccine [13] .",

For example, under the 30% clinical attack rate and 30 million doses per week scenario, a vaccination program starting 16 weeks before the start of the pandemic in the United States results in a 38% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. Delaying the start of vaccination to the same week as the pandemic starts in the United States drops the reductions to 18%. The number of vaccine doses administered each week is also very important. Decreasing the doses administered to 10 million per week causes the impact of vaccination in the above 2 scenarios to decline to 21% and 6% reductions, respectively. The assumptions related to VE of the first and second doses were relatively less important.",

We evaluated a wide range of vaccine program initiation times relative to disease introduction in the United States in this article. Although this information cannot be known in advance, beginning vaccination 16 weeks prior to the introduction of disease in the United States might be possible if the pandemic virus was identified, a stockpiled influenza vaccine were available and appropriate for use, officials were prepared to administer vaccine, and the decision to vaccinate was made at least 28 weeks before the establishment of the virus in the United States (based on current estimates of 12 weeks to fill and finish and begin distribution of stockpiled pandemic vaccine) [26] . This timeline is dependent on robust novel influenza virus surveillance that can identify influenza viruses with pandemic potential before widespread transmission has occurred. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, however, the first cases were identified in the United States after widespread transmission had already occurred, and no stockpiled vaccine or vaccine candidate seed viruses were available. In this example, the first doses of vaccine became available 26 weeks after identification of the first case in the United States and 8 weeks after the start of the main wave of pandemic illness in the fall of 2009 [27] . This situation is demonstrated by the scenarios beginning 8 or 16 weeks after the introduction of the virus into the United States [28] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Most important, because infections with influenza A(H7N9) so far have been rare [5] , the modeled number of pandemic-related hospitalizations and deaths, and the numbers of such that would be prevented by a vaccination program, can only be considered as illustrative and are not based on the current epidemiology of H7N9 or other novel influenza virus illnesses. These results, therefore, should not be interpreted as a prediction of the impact of a widespread outbreak of H7N9 or any other novel influenza A virus with pandemic potential. Additionally, we did not account for the effects of other interventions (eg, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as canceling mass gatherings or closing schools), the seasonality of when a novel virus might be introduced into the United States, or \"waves of illness,\" which are thought to have occurred in 3 modern pandemics [1, 2] . These factors could slow the course of the pandemic and thereby increase the amount of time to initiate and complete a vaccine program, increasing the number of hospitalizations and deaths averted. For ease of estimation, we also did not account for any adverse events associated with vaccination or for the indirect effects of vaccination (eg, herd immunity). Theoretically, accounting for indirect effects would likely increase the number of hospitalizations and deaths averted for those vaccination programs assumed to start before the pandemic; this effect would likely be lower for those programs assumed to start the same time as or after the pandemic. Another important assumption is that 80% of the population would want to be vaccinated. This is distinctly different from recent seasonal influenza coverage estimates of approximately 45% [14] . We do not know the precise correlation between severity of an influenza pandemic and public demand for vaccination, but 80% coverage may be an overestimate. Another potential limitation is that no data are available on the VE of a possible H7N9 vaccine. Thus, we based our estimates of VE of either an nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine, using data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, or a hypothetical vaccine with high VE based on data from adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine VE estimates. Limited data indicate that H7 vaccines have lower immunogenicity than seasonal influenza vaccines, which may result in lower VE [29, 30] . The population coverage or the effectiveness of a H7N9 or other future pandemic vaccine may be lower than what is assumed here, leading to a smaller number of averted outcomes.",
