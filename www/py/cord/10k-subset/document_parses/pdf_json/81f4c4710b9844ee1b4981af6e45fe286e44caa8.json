            "text": "A wide range of cancer immunotherapy approaches has been developed including non-specific immune-stimulants such as cytokines, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and adoptive T cell therapy. Among them, ICIs are the most commonly used and intensively studied. Since 2011, these drugs have received marketing authorisation for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal, and head and neck cancers, with remarkable and long-lasting treatment response in some patients. The novel mechanism of action of ICIs, with immune and T cell activation, leads to unusual patterns of response on imaging, with the advent of so-called pseudoprogression being more pronounced and frequently observed when compared to other anticancer therapies. Pseudoprogression, described in about 2-10% of patients treated with ICIs, corresponds to an increase of tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions due to infiltration by activated T cells before the disease responds to therapy. To overcome the limitation of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) to assess these specific changes, new imaging criteria-so-called immune-related response criteria and then immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)-were proposed. The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions into disease assessments and the need for a 4-week re-assessment to confirm or not confirm progression. The RECIST working group introduced the new concept of \"unconfirmed progression\", into the irRECIST. This paper reviews current immunotherapeutic approaches and summarises radiologic criteria to evaluate new patterns of response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, imaging features of immunotherapy-related adverse events and available predictive biomarkers of response are presented.",

As a result, T cells are exhausted and the anti-cancer functions of the immune system are weakened. ICIs remove these inhibitory signals, restore T cells from their exhausted status, and recover their cytotoxicity on tumour cells.

The mechanism behind pseudoprogression could be related to the infiltration of T cells into tumours, resulting initially in an apparent increase in tumour burden rather than true proliferation of tumour cells [17] . Associated inflammatory reaction, due to cytokine release, has been also observed in on-treatment biopsy samples performed after radiological progression in patients treated with ipilimumab [22] . Another explanation could be the time required to mount an adaptive immune response resulting in a continued tumour growth until a sufficient response develops [23] . Although pseudoprogression in patients treated with ICIs has been hotly debated, its incidence is actually low and differs depending on the tumour type (for example, less frequent in non-small cell lung cancer patients (< 5%) than in melanoma (< 10%)) ( Table 2) . As a consequence, an increase of tumour burden during ICI treatment is more likely to reflect true progression rather than pseudoprogression.",

It has been described after the onset of anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy with an incidence of about 10% [28] (Fig. 4) . To avoid misdiagnosing treatment-related disease hyperprogression with conventional progressive disease, it has been suggested to use the tumour growth rate to compare the growth rate before and after the initiation of treatment [29] . Using a definition of \u2265 2-fold increase of tumour growth rate before and after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, a hyperprogressive disease was found in 12 of 218 patients (9%) [29] . No association was found between hyperprogression and baseline tumour burden, the type of the and a 10-mm short-axis axillary lymph node (non-target lesion, lower panel, arrow). On a 3-month follow-up, both lesions enlarged with an increase of 38% of the target lesion leading to a progressive disease (PD) and a stop of treatment according to RECIST 1.1 and an unconfirmed PD with maintained treatment according to iRECIST criteria. On the two following CT examinations (March and June 2018), the lung metastasis decreased in size, but the axillary lymph node was stable (unconfirmed PD) but still significantly enlarged compared to the baseline (still unconfirmed PD according to iRECIST criteria). Finally, on August 2018, CT images showed a decrease in size of both lesions, confirming the pseudoprogression with a response assessed to be -70%, leading to a partial response according to iRECIST criteria immunotherapy, tumour histology, and number of previous lines of treatment. Nevertheless, hyperprogression was significantly correlated with patients' age and decreased overall survival. Notwithstanding these findings, the attribution of hyperprogression to immunotherapy remains controversial. In particular, hyperprogression has been observed in patients having received other therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy or even in the absence of treatment [30, 31] . Moreover, the mechanisms underlying hyperprogressive disease have not been elucidated yet.",

Due to the unidimensional measurement, partial response is now defined as \u2265 30% reduction in the sum of target lesions, stable disease as sum of target lesions < 20% increase and < 30% reduction, and a progressive disease as \u2265 20% increase of the sum of target lesions plus new measurable lesions from the nadir. More recently, the RECIST working group published the modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based therapy, socalled immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) [34] . Also using RECIST 1.1-based measurement, irRECIST introduced the new concept of \"unconfirmed progressive disease\" corresponding to progressive disease that remains to be confirmed on a 4-8-week follow-up imaging. If the patient condition is classified as unconfirmed progressive disease and is clinically stable, treatment should be continued. As opposed to other criteria developed for immunotherapy, a non-target lesion progression can define a progressive disease. Following irRECIST criteria, a partial response is defined as a \u2265 30% reduction in the sum of target lesions and unconfirmed progressive disease as \u2265 20% increase in the sum of target lesions from the nadir or non-target lesion progression or appearance of new lesion.",

            "text": "Although ICIs are safer compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy, they enhance the immune activity and may cause a dysregulation of immune homeostasis in normal tissues, which may lead to specific toxicities called \"immune-related adverse events\" (irAEs). They generally start the first few weeks after treatment; nevertheless, they can occur at any time, even after treatment discontinuation [37] [38] [39] . Their incidence and severity depend on the agent, with higher all-grade rates reported with anti-CTLA4 (up to 80%) compared to anti-PD1 (27%) and anti-PDL1 (17%) [39] [40] [41] [42] . Different tissues and organs may be affected and multisystem toxicities are common, with a spectrum of imaging manifestations in each organ [43] . Fatigue, cutaneous toxicities, colitis, and endocrine dysfunctions are the most frequent events, followed by hepatitis and pneumonitis [39] [40] [41] [42] . Other rare irAEs include nephrologic, neurologic, cardiologic, and haematologic toxicities [37, [40] [41] [42] . Although they are generally manageable mild toxicities, severe and lifethreatening events may occur in up to 7%, 3%, and 30% of patients receiving anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, and anti-CTLA4, respectively, reaching up to 55% with combined immunotherapy [39] [40] [41] [42] . IrAEs generally respond to immunotherapy holding and require corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment in more severe cases along with organ-specific treatment. Radiologic manifestations of irAEs can be found in up to 17% of patients receiving immunotherapy, and this may precede clinical manifestations [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . The knowledge of these peculiar toxicities is of utmost importance, because it ensures their early recognition while requiring the exclusion of differentials, mainly of infectious or tumoural nature.",

Diarrhoea is reported in up to 50% of patients; other presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody stools, and fever [49] . Complications include perforation, sepsis, frank bleeding, or dehydration [49] . At computed tomography (CT), ICI-induced colitis appears as a diffuse inflammatory pattern characterised by wall thickening, mucosal hyperenhancement, mesenteric hyperaemia, and air-fluid levels [47, 50, 51] . Segmental involvement has also been reported. At positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, colitis results in diffuse and intense 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG)-avidity along the entire bowel [47, 50] (Fig. 5) . These features may precede the onset of symptoms. Colonoscopy may show erythaema, ulceration, and mucosal friability, whereas neutrophilic, lymphocytic, or eosinophilic intraepithelial infiltrates and crypt invasion can be found on pathologic specimens [49, 50] . ICI-related hepatitis has been reported in up to 19% of patients receiving anti-CTLA4, whereas it is rarely reported when using anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 [40, 42] . Although it is usually limited to a mild elevation of transaminases, life-threatening liver dysfunction may occur [38, 39] . Imaging findings are shared with other causes of acute liver dysfunction, ranging from the absence of detectable abnormalities to hepatomegaly with parenchymal heterogeneity, periportal oedema, and perihepatic ascites [47, 50, 51] . While physiological 18 F-FDG uptake is usually not affected by diffuse liver diseases, a case of ICI-induced hepatitis showing an intense liver 18 F-FDG-uptake area at PET/CT has been reported [52] .",

Clinical and radiological features are similar to lymphocytic hypophysitis. Fatigue, headache, and hypopituitarismrelated symptoms are often reported. Hypophysitis can incidentally be detected by imaging in asymptomatic patients or before onset of symptoms. It presents as an enlarged hypophysis on brain CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or an 18 F-FDG-avid pituitary gland on PET/CT [46, 54, 55] . Any suspected hypophysitis requires an MRI of the pituitary gland to confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimickers such as metastasis and pituitary adenoma. On MRI, the pituitary gland is enlarged without mass effect on the optic chiasma, with a thickening of the infundibulum, and the hyperintensity of the posterior part of the gland is often missing [56, 57] . There is also a homogeneous or heterogeneous enhancement of the pituitary gland on contrast-enhanced images [56, 57] . Generally asymptomatic, ICI-induced thyroid dysfunction often presents as mild hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism on blood tests, with detectable anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies in most cases [58] . It is more frequently reported in patients receiving combined immunotherapy (20%) than in those with anti-PD1/antiPD-L1 (up to 10%) or anti-CTLA4 (around 5%) monotherapy [38, 39] . Ultrasound is the tool of choice in this setting. Thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous and hypoechoic parenchyma, often with a nodular or pseudonodular pattern, may be observed [55] . An increased vascularity at colour-Doppler evaluation may be also found. Nevertheless, it may be incidentally detected as diffuse hypermetabolic thyroid gland at restaging 18 F-FDG PET/CT [47, 55] .",

It includes patterns of organising pneumonia, the most commonly seen, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, or non-specified pneumonitis [64, 65] . Major elementary lesions are ground-glass opacities with a variable extent and location, reticulations, and alveolar consolidations, typically with a subpleural and peribronchovascular distribution in organising pneumonia pattern [61] (Fig. 6) . Progression of an organising pneumonia pattern to a non-specific groundglass opacity has been described. In addition, nodular aspect mimicking a tumour recurrence, as well as pembrolizumabassociated bronchiolitis, pleural effusions, or tracheitis, may be observed [45] . The diagnosis may be sensitive in case of underlying disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or previous radiotherapy. Moreover, if imaging appearances may suggest the diagnosis of immune-related pneumonitis, the establishment of the final diagnosis may remain challenging. The differential diagnosis must always be kept in mind, especially infectious disorders or tumour recurrence, this requiring a bronchoalveolar lavage in numerous cases of lung parenchymatous changes, if enabled by patient's conditions. Sarcoid-like reactions, including lymphadenopathy and pulmonary granulomatosis, have been reported in up to 5-7% of patients treated with ICIs [43, 47] . Typical imaging findings are symmetric mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement, which may appear hypermetabolic on PET/CT (Fig. 7) . Micronodules with perilymphatic distribution, especially in subpleural location, may also be seen [66] .",

Symptoms may vary, ranging from sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, to heart failure. Importantly, a normal electrocardiogram, biomarkers, or a preserved left ventricular function do not rule out ICI-associated myocarditis. There is an undeniable role of cardiac MRI that can show characteristic findings of acute myocarditis, including myocardial oedema and late gadolinium enhancement in the focal subepicardial lateral wall [67, 68] .

Thus, the threshold that separates a positive from negative PD-L1 expression remains debated and varies for each tumour type.

Currently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines encourage microsatellite instability testing for all patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, and for this population, ICIs are FDAapproved.

The percentage degree of TILs has been shown to correlate with a favourable prognosis in several tumours including melanoma and breast and ovarian cancers [77, 78] . The degree of TILs may be defined by both the extent and density of the TILs using an \"immunoscore\" based on the numeration of CD3+ and CD8+ T cell at the intratumoural region as well as at the invasive margin area [79] . Finally, three different immune profiles have been described: (1) the immune inflamed with dense CD8+ T cell infiltration within the tumour (highest probability of response), (2) the immune-excluded with abundant immune cells around the tumour but not penetrating inside the tumour (intermediate probability of response), and (3) the immune desert with few or no CD8+ T cells (lowest probability of response to immunotherapy). Fig. 8 A 75 -year-old woman with a low-differentiated primary cardiac sarcoma with microsatellite instability, treated with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1). Baseline contrast-enhanced MRI image shows a large retroatrial mass (arrow). Two months follow-up (FU) imaging shows a good reduction in the size of the mass assessed as -34% according to iRECIST criteria (partial response, arrow). One year FU imaging shows a complete response Only few imaging biomarkers have been studied for predicting response to immunotherapy. A radiomics approach was used to assess tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients included in phase 1 trials of PD-1 and PD-L1 monotherapy [80] . A radiomic signature of CD8+ T cells was developed using CT images and RNA sequencing data from 135 patients (training set) and validated on three different cohorts of patients including 137 patients treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 drugs. High baseline radiomics score was associated with higher proportion of patients with objective response at 3 and 6 months. Moreover, high radiomics score was significantly associated with improved outcomes with a median overall survival of 24.3 versus 11.5 months in high and low radiomics score, respectively.",

Familiarity with the specificity of response and immune-related side effects is essential for radiologists to accurately evaluate the response to treatment and help clinician for optimal patient management. Although pseudoprogression occurs only in few patients treated with ICIs, new criteria (irRC, irRE-CIST, iRECIST, and imRECIST) has been developed to address this issue in clinical trials. Their use in clinical routine should be prudent as data are still limited.
