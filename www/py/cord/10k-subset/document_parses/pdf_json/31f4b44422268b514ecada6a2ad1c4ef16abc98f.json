Becoming infected with each of the 3 strains of influenza does not confer long-lasting immunity; in contrast, becoming infected naturally with, for example, measles does confer long-lasting immunity.

The multiple RNA segments -there are 8 in all -predispose to the genetic instability of the influenza virus (table I, fig. 2 ). The nucleotide sequences in the RNA segments are inherently unstable, and when 2 different strains of the same subtype infect the same host the RNA segments can reassort, giving rise to progeny that are different from the 2 parents.",

In 10, the immune response was superior in young subjects; in 4, the elderly responded better, and in 16, no significant difference was noted between the young and old subjects; in this instance, the lack of differences may have been due to a type 2 error because the numbers studied were low. pointed out 3 methodological limitations. The studies included, firstly, subjects with illnesses or taking drugs, which affect the immune system; secondly, patients immunised previously with influenza vaccine; and finally, those with protective antibody levels before immunisation.

Protective levels are usually achieved in 70 to 90% of vaccine recipients. reviewed 17 papers on this subject published between 1968 and 1988. A total Drugs & Aging 1 (6) 1991 of 30 comparisons were available in the 17 papers. In 10, the immune response was superior in young subjects; in 4, the elderly responded better, and in 16, no significant difference was noted between the young and old subjects; in this instance, the lack of differences may have been due to a type 2 error because the numbers studied were low. pointed out 3 methodological limitations. The studies included, firstly, subjects with illnesses or taking drugs, which affect the immune system; secondly, patients immunised previously with influenza vaccine; and finally, those with protective antibody levels before immunisation. Inclusion of patients with any of these 3 factors would tend to underestimate the ability of elderly subjects to respond to immunisation.

The predominant virus strain is shown above the peak of mortality for each epidemic season. The epidemic threshold for the 1987-88 influenza season was estimated at 1.645 standard deviations above the values projected on the basis of a periodic regression model applied to observed pneumonia and influenza deaths for the previous 5-year period but excluding the observations during influenza outbreaks (reproduced with permission from Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 37: 502, 1988).",
