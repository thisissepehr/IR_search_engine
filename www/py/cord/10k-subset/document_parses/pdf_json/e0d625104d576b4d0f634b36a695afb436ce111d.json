In contrast, chronic moderate drinking (CMD) has been associated with improved cardiovascular health and immunity. These differential outcomes have been linked to alterations in both innate and adaptive branches of the immune system; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this question, we determined the impact of chronic drinking on the transcriptional and functional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from male rhesus macaques classified as CMD or CHD after 12 months of voluntary ethanol self-administration. Our analysis suggests that chronic alcohol drinking, regardless of dose alters resting transcriptomes of PBMC, with the largest impact seen in innate immune cells. These transcriptional changes are partially explained by alterations in microRNA profiles. Additionally, chronic alcohol drinking is associated with a dose dependent heightened inflammatory profiled at resting and following LPS stimulation. Moreover, we observed a dose-dependent shift in the kinetics of transcriptional responses to LPS. These findings may explain the dichotomy in clinical and immunological outcomes observed with moderate versus heavy alcohol drinking.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Observational studies in humans have reported strong associations between chronic heavy drinking (CHD) and significant organ damage as indicated by increased incidence of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) 1 , alcoholic liver disease (ALD) 2 , certain cancers 3-5 , cardiovascular diseases 6,7 , and sepsis 8 .

In both cases, these differences were observed in the absence of changes in frequencies of major circulating immune cells 43, 46 suggesting potential immune reprogramming with both CMD and CHD, most likely in innate immune cells.

However, these studies stimulated human PBMC or THP1/RAW cell lines with LPS for various durations in the presence of different amounts of ethanol and measured canonical LPS inducible cytokines as readouts.

These findings are in agreement with recent clinical studies that showed greater inflammatory mediator production by alveolar macrophages and PBMC obtained from human excessive/heavy alcohol consumers in response to LPS and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) 53 . While post-LPS production of cytokines ex vivo is a measure of immunocompetence, spontaneous production of cytokines has been previously linked to a state of in vivo activation 54 . Indeed, in line with this hypothesis, a recent report in humans suggested that the ethanol dose consumed positively correlated with serum markers of monocyte activation 55 , providing a potential explanation for heighted pro-inflammatory responses to LPS in CHD. Interestingly, our analysis revealed dose-associated drop in spontaneously produced RANTES and post LPS induction of MIP-1\u03b2.

To begin to address this question, we investigated the transcriptional response to LPS stimulation. RNA-Seq measurements in PBMC from control animals at 16 hours post stimulation indicate activation of canonical inflammatory pathways associated with an LPS response such as cytokine signaling and innate immune response; and regulatory mechanisms such as mRNA catabolism, translation, and apoptosis. In contrast, responses in CHD animals indicate down-regulation of several genes involved in leukocyte differentiation, wound healing, and cytokine signaling. These observations are suggestive of a resolution phase. This scenario is corroborated by up-regulation of IL10, essential for a strong anti-inflammatory response 59 , in CHD animals only (Fig. 5d ).
