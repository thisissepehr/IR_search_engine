The objective of this study was to determine frequency, risk factors, and outcome of ALI in patients with infectious pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with microbiologically positive pneumonia, hospitalized at two Mayo Clinic Rochester hospitals between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. In a subsequent nested case-control analysis, we evaluated the differences in prehospital and intrahospital exposures between patients with and without ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) matched by specific pathogen, isolation site, gender, and closest age in a 1:1 manner. Results: The study included 596 patients; 365 (61.2%) were men. The median age was 65 (IQR, 53 to 75) years. In total, 171 patients (28.7%) were diagnosed with ALI. The occurrence of ALI was less frequent in bacterial (n = 99 of 412, 24%) compared with viral (n = 19 of 55, 35%), fungal (n = 39 of 95, 41%), and mixed isolates pneumonias (n = 14 of 34, 41%; P = 0.002). After adjusting for baseline severity of illness and comorbidities, patients in whom ALI developed had a markedly increased risk of hospital death (OR adj 9.7; 95% CI, 6.0 to 15.9). In a nested case-control study, presence of shock (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 2.8 to 45.9), inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5), and transfusions (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 19.6) independently predicted ALI development.

If an appropriate control was not found for a specific pathogen, matching was for the same genus, family, and finally pathogen group (G-, G+, atypical bacteria, viruses, and fungi). Patients with coinfections were matched to appropriate controls in the same fashion (all pathogens were matched). Because preliminary data suggested increased risk of ALI among Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, these cases were matched to specific pathogen, regardless of coinfection. The matching was conservative to provide as perfect as possible matches. Among 171 cases of ALI, 118 were diagnosed with ALI more than 6 hours after pneumonia onset, of whom 112 were matched according these criteria. We extracted data from the preexisting hospital electronic database, which included integrated microbiologic and susceptibility results, vital signs as well as laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and use of medications. Risk factors were compared between patients who developed ALI and matched controls. For quality assurance, we performed random checks of electronic database entries. Standard definitions were used for shock [21] , inappropriate antimicrobial treatment [22] , and transfusions [23] . We used the Pneumonia severity index (PSI) [24] to assess baseline severity of illness and the Charlson score [25] as a measure of comorbidities.

ALI rates in our study were higher compared with a previous study of hospitalized patients with clinically defined pneumonia by Ferguson and colleagues (10%) [4] . This could be due to the inclusion, in our study, of only patients with a high clinical suspicion of pneumonia and identified isolates, which has been described in fewer than 50% of hospitalized patients with pneumonia [27] .

We observed a higher proportion of ALI occurrence in patients with less common infections due to fungal and viral respiratory pathogens. The higher rate of ALI among these pathogen groups likely relates to P. jiroveci, and specific endemic fungi, including Blastomyces species and viral infections (RSV, cytomegalovirus). Possible explanations for this higher risk include delayed antimicrobial treatment, as these pathogens are often not treated with initial empiric antimicrobial coverage, as well as baseline characteristics of the patients, because these infections more commonly occur in those who are immunocompromised. Progression to ALI is likely a result of a complex interaction of patient immune status and specific pathogen [29] . Conversely, when adjusted for a specific pathogen, immunosupression did not influence progression to ALI. However, these results must be interpreted with caution because matching by specific pathogen is similar to matching by immune status or other baseline risk factors for these pathogens, which precludes analyzing the significance of these risk factors for developing ALI. Unfortunately, our study design does not allow further assessment of independent effects of a pathogen on risk for ALI development. Although numerous reports exist of Legionella pneumoniainduced ARDS, our study failed to confirm an increased risk of ALI in these patients. It is possible that early initiation of empiric antimicrobial coverage for atypical bacteria, as proposed in current pneumonia guidelines, has reduced this devastating complication in patients with Legionella pneumonia.

In patients with pneumonia, inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment noticeably increases the risk of hospital death [41, 42] . The failure to provide adequate antibiotic treatments is more likely in HCAP and HAP, as Gram-negative bacteria and S. aureus are major pathogens in these patients [28] . In addition to antimicrobial resistance [41] , it seems that patients with HCAP are often not empirically treated for these organisms, resulting in suboptimal antibiotic therapy and increased mortality [43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 975, "end": 978, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1149, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1358, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although shock was clearly associated with ALI development, the association of delayed goal-directed resuscitation could not be examined because of a relatively low number of shock patients among controls. The observed association between transfusion and lung injury has been demonstrated in number of studies [40, 44, 45] . The observed association between the use of statins and the decreased risk of ALI is consistent with the recent report by O'Neal et al. [46] . Contrary to a previous report in a population-based cohort of nonselected patients at risk of ALI [47] , the use of antiplatelet agents in patients with infectious pneumonia was not associated with decreased risk of ALI. Severe pneumonia is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [48] [49] [50] [51] . The majority of these studies failed to account for ALI as well as its role in the course of pneumonia and patient outcomes. Our work demonstrated that the development of ALI is independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for baseline severity of illness and comorbidities. This is particularly important because multiple factors influence ALI development and are potential targets for preventing this devastating syndrome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 310, "end": 314, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 319, "end": 322, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 461, "end": 465, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 566, "end": 570, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 768, "end": 772, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 773, "end": 777, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 778, "end": 782, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has several limitations. First, enrollment was limited to microbiologically proven pneumonia. Because the majority of patients with pneumonia do not undergo any microbial testing, some patients with pneumonia were excluded and may have biased our study population to more severe cases that underwent such evaluation.

Because only semiquantitative analysis of lower respiratory secretions were available, differentiation between microbiologically definite and probable pneumonia was not possible in all patients. Conversely, because ALI/ARDS also has noninfectious etiologies (aspiration, organizing pneumonia, transfusion-induced lung injury (TRALI), acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and other interstitial lung diseases), we believe that isolation of a microbiologic agent strengthened the diagnosis of infectious pneumonia and prevented the inclusion of noninfectious lung diseases that might have been included by using only the clinical definition.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 509, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 547, "end": 551, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, because we matched by pathogen, we could not properly examine the influence of specific pathogen and immune status on ALI development.
