While standard production theory normally relates inputs to outputs, Santerre [30] recently argues that population and variety of services serve as reasonable proxies for the scale and breadth of output given that public health services are not directly observable and measurable. For example, a greater population likely means more restaurant inspections by public health officials.

In contrast, epidemiological/ environmental services include various epidemiology and surveillance activities, population-based primary prevention services (e.g., obesity or substance abuse), regulation, inspection and licensing services such as overseeing septic tank installation, public drinking water quality, or housing inspections, and other environmental health activities (e.g., hazardous waste disposal, pollution prevention, and land use planning).

This clinical function of some LHDs compares closely to those provided by community health centers. separate outputs in the DEA. Only the variety of different clinical and nonclinical services produced internally by each LHD is treated as outputs.

The five labor inputs are: the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) managers, nurses, sanitarians, clerical employees, and other employees. The percentage of employees with personal computers and the percentage with access to the internet represent the two measures of capital. Unfortunately, other measures of capital such as the market value of buildings and equipment are not provided by the data source. 8 For the DEA analysis we allow for variable returns to scale and use the Banker, Charnes, and Cooper [1] model for measuring the input-oriented technical efficiency of a LHD. The basic DEA model was initially developed by assuming that all values of inputs and outputs are strictly positive. But in some situations, the inputs and outputs could be zeros and negatives.

Zero outputs generally do not pose a problem in standard efficiency models because the output constraint corresponding to the zero output will always be feasible irrespective of the model orientation [35, p309] . 9 However, zero inputs introduce bias in DEA analysis because at least one unit with a zero input will always be VRS or CRS efficient regardless of the levels of its remaining inputs or outputs [35, p310] . In other words, when a DMU has a zero value of an input k, all peers of that DMU being assessed should also have a zero value on that input k. Thus, at least one DMU with zero value on input k will be a peer to the DMU being assessed and so will be Pareto-efficient irrespective of what values such a peer has on outputs or inputs other than k (even if they are using inefficiently large amounts of other inputs). This implies a restricted reference set for the units with zero inputs, since DMUs with zero values of an input will only be compared among themselves [35, p312] . Further, from a conceptual standpoint, health departments that can produce the given outputs with zero values of some inputs operate differently than those that require at least some amounts of those inputs to produce the same outputs. Hence, in a sense, these two groups do not face the same options of transforming inputs into outputs and so may face different technologies.

First, since population represents one of the outputs, variables describing the degree of population heterogeneity seem to be relevant. A more heterogeneous population likely requires more inputs relative to output because varied needs must be satisfied.

In fact, Santerre [29] argues that many local public health services act as density off-setting goods. That is, high neighborhood density generates increased negative externalities such as heightened antisocial behavior, faster spreading of communicable diseases, and more public health hazards due to improper sanitation. Consequently, a greater amount of resources may be needed relative to population in more congested areas.

However, the LHD may contract out for some services and some other public health services might be produced by higher levels of government or nongovernmental agencies. Therefore, to control for different levels of responsibility with respect to public health services across LHDs, the percentage of services provided externally is specified as an additional variable in the estimation equation. A direct relationship between the degree of external production and the DEA score might suggest that efficiency is improved through specialization. Oppositely, if economies of scope exist such that the same resources can produce a variety of services, an inverse relationship between the percentage of services provided externally and (internal) efficiency can be expected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Second stage analysis explaining efficiency differences among LHDs"}, {"text": "Fourth, some LHDs rely more on external funding from the state and federal governments than others.

Second, greater external funding may simply reflect that public health problems are more severe in those particular LHDs. More severe problems require additional inputs.

On the one hand, the Tiebout theory [36] argues that decentralization promotes efficiency. People shop for local public goods like public health by voting with their feet and this Tiebout-type competition forces public decision-makers to operate more efficiently. On the other hand, centralization could favor coordination and thereby enhance the efficiency of public health delivery.

The bootstrap procedure produced bias-corrected efficiency scores between, but excluding 0 and 1. After simulation, the number of facilities with high efficiency scores was reduced. Second, as the regression residuals have a truncated distribution because the dependent variable (the DEA efficiency scores) are naturally bounded between 0 and 1, a truncated regression with random effects was performed.

The degree of inefficiency faced by LHDs seems to be particularly high especially when compared to hospitals for which measured efficiency averages around 85% [17] . While perhaps not much of a problem now, the inefficiency may take on greater meaning if LHDs assume more social responsibilities in the future as many policymakers suspect. The paper also finds that several factors are associated with the degree of inefficiency. LHDs appear to be more efficient when they provide internally a greater variety of services and when they are spending their own money.

If the data ever become available it would be desirable to revisit this analysis with a panel data set. The panel data would help control for unobservable heterogeneity to some degree and also introduce a dynamic component into the analysis. Two, the analysis would be strengthened with expenditure data broken down by each type of service provided internally and externally. Third, data for other types of capital and non-labor inputs, more demographic and environmental data, and some measures of the quality of public health services for each LHD would add to the analysis. Indeed, measures of structural, process, and outcome quality are particularly important for the DEA given that less resources devoted to an activity, while potentially reflecting increased efficiency, may also reflect reduced levels of process quality or less \"quality time\" devoted to a particular activity. 17 At least, this paper will serve as a template for a more ambitious study when that data become available.

An efficient DMU will have \u03b8*=1, implying that no equi-proportionate reduction in inputs is possible, whereas an inefficient DMU will have \u03b8*<1. In model (1) above, the production process is allowed to exhibit variable returns to scale (VRS). In other words, we do not make the restrictive assumption of constant returns to scale (CRS). Rather, we allow the data to decide whether a particular health department operates under increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale. 17 See Nyman and Bricker [24] for a health care study that incorporates a quality measure in the second stage of the DEA and finds an inverse relationship between quality and efficiency with respect to the provision of nursing home care. More recently, Bates et al. [3] also find an inverse relationship between proxies for quality and efficiency in the context of hospital services in the second stage of the analysis. Zhang et al. [40] find that higher nurse staffing is inversely related to efficiency but not when controls are made for quality. Prior [25] also addresses quality in the context of the efficient production of health care services while Sherman and Zhu [31] make a strong case for quality-adjusted DEA (or Q-DEA). 16 Data users are required to provide NACCHO with a copy of any published articles.
