Loci (DXY21, DX232, DX233) shown to map to this region on the X chromosome and in some cases to be deleted in other patients with choroideremia are intact in the DNA from this patient. To our knowledge this is the first report of a translocation associated with choroideremia. One of the translocation chromosomes, derivative 13, free of the derivative X and normal X, has been isolated in a somatic cell hybrid. Because of the clinical association of the eye findings with chromosome interchange, we suggest that the breakpoint on the X is at or near the choroideremia locus. Further analysis of this translocation may be useful in cloning the choroideremia gene.",

In the first decade of life, affected males show night blindness and a progressive loss of peripheral vision. Blindness in most affected males eventually occurs by the third or fourth decade of life (McCulloch and McCulloch 1948; Sorsby et al. 1952 ). Female carriers are asymptomatic but can be diagnosed due to a characteristic patchy pigmentation of the optic fundus (McCulloch and McCulloch 1948) . At present, the biochemical basis of the defect is unknown (Rodrigues et al. 1984) .",

The oral contraceptive was taken for another 6 years. She began experiencing hot flashes and marked mood changes. Endocrine investigations revealed serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone at post-menopausal concentrations: 74mIU/m1, and 91mIU/ml, respectively. Serum prolactin level was normal. Cyclical treatment with conjugated estrogens (Premarin, Ayerst) 0.625 mg p.o. for 25 days followed by medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera, Upjohn) 10 mg p.o. for 5 days resulted in regression of symptoms.",

There was the occasional pigment cell in the vitreous. On indirect ophthalmoscopy, pigmentary mottling at the level of the retinal pigment epi-thelium (RPE) was noted. In the midperiphery scalloped areas of RPE and choriocapillaris loss were noted.There was one area of RPE hyperplasia but no areas of RPE migration into the retina. The optic disc and retina vessels appeared normal. In the subretinal space or deep retina near the optic disc, white calcific tumors were noted. Fluorescein angiography highlighted the RPE mottling and the RPE and choriocapillaris atrophy. The white calcific tumors stained late. On B scan ultrasonography the tumors demonstrated high reflectivity consistent with calcification. The electroretinogram and color vision (Fansworth-Munsell 100 Hue test) were normal. The electrooculargram was abnormal with reduced Arden ratios of 1.4 and 1.28 for the right and left eyes, respectively.

Briefly, washed cells were lysed with 1% SDS and the protein digested at 37 ~ overnight with 50 gg/ml proteinase K. After phenol-chloroform extraction, the DNA was dialyzed against several changes of dialysis buffer (10mM TRIS-HCI, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA) and digested with the indicated restriction endonuclease using the conditions described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). The restriction fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel in TAE [50mM TRIS (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS), 20 mM Na acetate, 2 mM ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0] and subjected to electrophoresis overnight at 40 V. The DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose paper by the method of Southern (1975) , baked in vacuo at 80 ~ and incubated at 42 ~ in 50% formamide, 5 \u2022 SSC (1 \u2022 SSC is 0.15M NaC1, 0.015 M Na citrate), 5 \u2022 Denhardt's solution (Denhardt 1968 ), 100gg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 300 gg/ml yeast RNA.

The observation that the DXYS1 locus (probe pDP34) was retained in the somatic cell hybrid containing the der (13) chromosome indicates that this locus is distal to the choroideremia gene. This agrees with recently published in-formation mapping several loci around the choroideremia gene (Cremers et al. 1989) . Since the hybrid cell containing the der (13) chromosome did not contain DNA sequences detectable by the JL68, and JL8 probes for the loci DXS232 and DXS233, respectively, this implies that either these loci are deleted in the patient's DNA or are located on the der (X) chromosome. Analysis of the patient's DNA suggests that both the DX232 and DX233 loci are intact. This implies that these loci are present on the der (X) chromosome, although this will require proof by isolating this chromosome from the der (13).",
