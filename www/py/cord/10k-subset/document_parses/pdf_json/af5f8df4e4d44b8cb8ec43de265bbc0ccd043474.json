The serial study of 12 healthy subjects suggested the involvement of 'small airways' (frequencydependence of dynamic compliance) 4-8 weeks after the start of the infection, with a return to normal after an additional four weeks. In a follow-up study of 18 healthy adults Cate et aP* recorded pulmonary function during 24 illness episodes caused by eight rhinovirus strains. While no consistent effects on ventilary function were found, these authors noticed a significant decrease in steady-state diffusing capacity-a finding attributed by them to ventilation inhomogeneity due to bronchiolitis. The study by Fridy et aP 5 included 52 subjects, 22 of whom returned for serial studies of pulmonary function during and after a mild viral respiratory illness. A complete battery of pulmonary function tests was used (static lung volumes, closing volume, air-and helium-flow-volume curves); the pulmonary function changes, suggesting peripheral airways obstruction, occurred only in smokers, and persisted for several weeks. Using experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy volunteers, Blair et aP 6 demonstrated the greater sensitivity of frequency-dependence of dynamic compliance which became abnormal when closing volume, maximal expiratory flows, specific conductance were unchanged. For Bush et aP 1 the most sensitive test was the volume of isoflow, and the methacholine response became positive in the three (out of seven) subjects developing lower airways and systemic symptoms. An increase in bronchia] reactivity is in agreement with clinical data 2 * showing that more than half of rhinovirus infection episodes are associated with wheezing in children and adults. Airway hyperreactivity may be the consequence of sensitization of airway epithelial receptors after mucosal cell damage, of a diminished adrenergic response of bronchial smooth muscle, or of histamine release secondary to virus infection. 29 The subject remains controversial, however, as negative results have also been recently reported. XM The only study of pulmonary function in normal children with upper respiratory infections was done in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, by Collier et al. 1 * A total of 55 children aged 2.5 to 11 years were followed for a mean duration of two years, yielding 617 'well' and 237 'illness' observations. Lung function tests comprised spirometry (including forced expiratory flows) and static lung volumes (helium dilution); the observed lung function values were adjusted (by sex) for height and clinical status (normal or upper respiratory illness). Adjusted mean values of FVC, FEV,, PEF, MMF, and FEF\u00bb* decreased during upper respiratory illness, the differences between the mean values of the 'illness' and 'well' observations were not significant in children over seven years of age. In younger children, FVC, FEV,, PEF and FEFjo* showed significant difference in girls, while only FVC and PEF did so in boys. TLC and the functional residual capacity did not differ in any sex-age group. In the present study, age, height and weight were not significantly different in children with and without ARI allowing the comparison of absolute values of lung function results. The presence of an ARI was significantly associated with male sex, and pulmonary function was impaired in boys but not in girls.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 13, "end": 14, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2028, "text": "29", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This finding suggests that male gender increases vulnerability for respiratory disease not only in adults, 32 but also in children. Most ventilatory function indices were decreased in boys with ARI. The differences between means ranged from 3-4% for FVC and FEV] to more than 10% for FEFJO* (p < 0.001). We were somewhat surprised to find a non-significant difference for FEF^*, as this index is in principle more sensitive to early airflow limitation. 33 Our results confirmed the lack of sensitivity of this index for detecting abnormality during ARI in children 14 -21 and adults; 3 this is attributable in part to the high coefficient of variation. In the children studied by us the differences in the whole group were exclusively due to impairment of lung function in boys. The sex difference observed was not due to statistical factors (lower inter-subject variability in boys) but to the absence of any effect of 33 A narrowing of airways is expected to have a greater effect on airway resistance or forced flows the smaller the baseline diameter is. Contrary to this prediction, and to the results of Collier et a/, 14 we found the differences in ventilatory function to be significant in older boys (Table 5) . Although we find no obvious explanation for this, it should be stressed that the comparison between this study and that of Collier et al is limited by several important differences. First, their study was a prospective longitudinal one, each child having several measurements done; they were able to statistically validate minimal differences in pulmonary function (eg 50 ml or 50 ml s~'). Second, their children were much younger than those studied by us (2.5 to 11 years old). Third, 66% of their children were black, and racial differences in the reaction to virus infection may exist. In our study, lung volumes and distribution of ventilation were less influenced by ARI, confirming the negative results of Collier et al. 14 There was one exception to this, however. In boys, a slight increase of the RV/TLC ratio accompanied a marginally significant increase of phase HI slope (Table 3) . Although minor, these changes are of interest because the same two variables were altered (borderline statistical significance) in a group of asymptomatic adults with a history of recent acute respiratory infection. 36 - 37 An increase in RV and in P III slope was reported by Coates et a/ 38 after experimental iv infusion of saline in man; this suggests that peripheral airway obstruction (revealed by hyperinflation and altered distribution of ventilation) accompanies minimal increases in interstitial lung fluid. Closing volume and closing capacity proved to be of no value in detecting abnormality, in agreement with a previous report on passive exposure to tobacco smoke. 39 The impairment of pulmonary function variables in children with ARI was not due to the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms, since the results were unchanged (with unavoidable loss of statistical significance) when the analysis was restricted to the 39 children without chronic symptoms (Table 6 ). Tobacco smoking did not interact with the influence of ARI since the exclusion of 18 children who smoked among the symptomatic group had no influence on the results. Atmospheric pollution is known to increase the incidence of respiratory infections in children;* this influ-ence was excluded in the present study as the children came from a non-polluted area. Other factors, which were not controlled in this analysis, are represented by parental respiratory symptoms, 41 parental smoking, 41 -42 socioeconomic and educational level 43 or housing conditions. 44 Can a mild ARI have consequences in the long term? In contrast to the severe infections due to aggressive viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) whose sequels are well known, 43 the reported regression of physiological disturbances over 3 to 6 weeks 13 -23 allows this question to be answered in the negative, at least for healthy subjects.
