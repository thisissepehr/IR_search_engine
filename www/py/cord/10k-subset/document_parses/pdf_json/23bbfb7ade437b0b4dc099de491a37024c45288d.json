            "text": "Epidemiological studies have observed that the seasonal peak incidence of influenza virus infection is sometimes separate from the peak incidence of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection, with the peak incidence of hRSV infection delayed. This is proposed to be due to viral interference, whereby infection with one virus prevents or delays infection with a different virus. We investigated viral interference between hRSV and 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) in the ferret model. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 prevented subsequent infection with hRSV. Infection with hRSV reduced morbidity attributed to infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 but not infection, even when an increased inoculum dose of hRSV was used. Notably, infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune mediators in the ferret than hRSV. Minimal cross-reactive serological responses or interferon \u03b3-expressing cells were induced by either virus \u226514 days after infection. These data indicate that antigen-independent mechanisms may drive viral interference between unrelated respiratory viruses that can limit subsequent infection or disease.",

Influenza A virus infections also interrupted peak incidences of hRSV infections in Japan during 2000-2002 [2] and in the Netherlands during 2003-2012 [3] . Negative associations between respiratory viruses have been reported when analyzing the proportion of coinfections with different respiratory viruses, using swab specimens from patients [6, 7, 17] . A(H1N1)pdm09 was least likely to be detected with any of the other respiratory viruses tested, including hRSV, in samples from all age groups [8, 18] . Taken together, these data suggest that interference may occur between A(H1N1)pdm09 and hRSV.",

Historically, the ferret has also been used to study hRSV infection [21] [22] [23] , with recent studies assessing the pathogenesis, immunity, and transmission of hRSV [24, 25] . Clinical symptoms are mild in ferrets infected with hRSV strains described to date [24, 25] . Previously, we used the ferret model to demonstrate that viral interference can occur following infection with human influenza A and B viruses and will prevent, delay, or limit subsequent infection with an influenza virus of a different type, subtype, or lineage [10, 11] . Notably, this effect depends on the virus combinations and the order and timing of sequential infections [10, 11, 26] . We have established complementary influenza viral dynamics models that explain these observations via the innate immune response [27] and cross-reactive adaptive immune responses [28] .",

Accordingly, samples were considered to be infectious for hRSV when the amount of viral RNA exceeded 10 3.8 copies/100 \u03bcL nasal wash and infectious for A(H1N1)pdm09 when viral RNA exceeded 10 6 copies/100 \u00b5L of nasal wash for at least 1 measurement. Clinical signs (ie, weight loss and fever) were assessed daily, and seroconversion was measured 14 days after challenge.",

There was significant increase in expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA 2 days after infection and of interleukin 1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNAs 6/7 days after infection in ferrets infected with hRSV as compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 ( Figure 5C, 5I, and 5J ). This suggests a localized inflammatory response was induced after hRSV infection, which coincided with the increase in hRSV virus replication ( Figure 5A ). To directly compare the magnitude of expression of cytokines and chemokines induced by both virus infections, we assessed mRNA expression on the day after infection at which the level of virus shedding was highest (ie, day 2 for A(H1N1) pdm09 and day 6 for hRSV). When assessed at these times, an equivalent fold change in mRNA expression was observed for RSV N and influenza virus M ( Figure 5A ). Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induced significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b2 (P = .00021; Figure 5D ), IL-6 (P = .0088; Figure 5I ), interleukin 12p40 (P = .0137; Figure 5L ), MCP-1 (P = .0018; Figure 5N ), and TNF-\u03b1 (P = .00078; Figure 5O ) mRNA expression in ferrets, compared with hRSV. These data suggests there is increased inflammation in nasal tissues of animals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 as compared to hRSV.

            "text": "Responses to concanavalin A were similar for all ferrets regardless of infection ( Figure 6B ). Moreover, there was limited serological cross-reactivity. Animals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 had high levels of influenza virus-specific neutralizing antibodies ( Figure 6C ), yet minimal total serum or neutralizing antibodies to hRSV ( Figure 6D and 6E) . Similarly, infection with hRSV induced total serum and neutralizing antibodies to hRSV but few antibodies that were reactive with A(H1N1)pdm09 ( Figure 6C-E) . DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 can prevent infection and replication of hRSV in a ferret model of human disease for up to 7 days. Infection with hRSV did not prevent subsequent infection with A(H1N1)pdm09; rather, animals were coinfected, albeit with reduced morbidity. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 leads to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the respiratory tract as compared to infection with hRSV. Overall, these data support the ecological observation that viral interference induced by A(H1N1)pdm09 infection delayed infection with hRSV in the winter of 2009-2010. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induced higher expression of MCP-1, IL-6, type I IFNs, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and granzyme A/B mRNAs as compared to hRSV infection. MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 regulate the migration of macrophages/monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells into the respiratory tract. Macrophages produce MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6; thus, upregulation of these genes suggests an influx of macrophages and NK cells into the respiratory tissues [34] . NK cells produce IFN-\u03b3, which activates macrophages and neutrophils and promotes T-cell proliferation and killing of virus-infected cells [34] . Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells also produce granzymes A/B, increased expression of IFN-\u03b3 and granzyme A/B mRNAs on day 6 after infection suggests recruitment/activation of these cells to the site of infection. IL-6 and type I IFNs are produced by respiratory epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells [34, 35] . IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine, whereas type I IFNs induce an antiviral state that may also limit replication and spread of hRSV [34, 35] It would be useful to explore the cellular infiltrate following A(H1N1)pdm09 and hRSV infections to gain further insight . Ferrets were infected with 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of hRSV strain Long or 10 3.5 50% tissue culture infectious doses of A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 4 ferrets/virus). Nasal wash specimens were collected after challenge from ferrets on days 2 and 6 after infection, and mRNA was assayed for the indicated genes, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. For each graph, qPCR data are expressed as fold changes relative to values for nasal wash specimens from uninfected animals and normalized to ATF4 and GAPDH housekeeping genes. In panel A, expression of N is shown for hRSV-infected ferrets, and expression of M is shown for influenza virus-infected ferrets. For statistical analyses, inflammatory mediators were compared between (1) hRSV-infected and A(H1N1)pdm09-infected animals sampled on day 2 after infection, (2) hRSV-infected and A(H1N1)pdm09-infected animals sampled on day 6/7 after infection, and (3) A(H1N1)pdm09-infected animals sampled on day 2 and hRSV-infected animals sampled on day 6 after infection. Fold changes were compared between viruses, using the Mann-Whitney U test. IFN, interferon; IL-1, interleukin 1; IL-6, interleukin 6; IL-8, interleukin 8; IL-10, interleukin 10; IL-12p40, interleukin 12p40; IL-17, interleukin 17; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .001, and ****P < .0001. into potential differences in the level and cellular composition present in local inflammation. Infection with A(H1N1) pdm09 induced a 7-fold higher cellular IFN-\u03b3 recall response as compared to infection with hRSV in our study. Because there was no significant difference in IFN-\u03b3 responses to concanavalin A between the groups, this observation was not due to a difference in overall T-cell numbers but, instead, was due to an increase in the reactivation of A(H1N1)pdm09-specific cells. Taken together, these data suggest that infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induces a robust cytokine and chemokine response that strongly stimulates the adaptive and memory immune responses. Conversely, infection with hRSV elicited a weaker and more limited cytokine and chemokine response that led to a reduced antigen-specific cellular response. However, it is possible that hRSV may not infect the ferret respiratory tract as efficiently as A(H1N1)pdm09 does, and this could result in reduced inflammatory responses. Yet, infected animals seroconverted at titers consistent for sterilizing immunity, indicating a productive infection (data not shown) [24] . Furthermore, increasing the inoculum of hRSV did not significantly affect the pattern or amount of virus shedding nor the expression of inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the hRSV level was already maximal in this ferret model. Notably, increased expression of inflammatory mediators following infection with influenza virus as compared to hRSV has been observed in studies assessing human clinical samples and in vitro airway epithelial cell cultures [36] [37] [38] [39] .",

The increased antiviral state and inflammation observed after A(H1N1)pdm09 infection has the potential to prevent subsequent infection or delay shedding of hRSV, as was observed here. Both viruses predominantly infect ciliated airway epithelial cells, and we have shown that A(H1N1)pdm09 and hRSV Long replicated in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of ferrets [24, 30] . Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 can also prevent infection with an influenza B/Yamagata virus [10] . There are minimal shared epitopes between influenza A and B viruses [40] , and we showed that minimal cross-reactive IFN-\u03b3-producing cells were induced between hRSV and influenza virus. These data suggest that short-lived mechanisms drive this effect, as no effect was detected in ferrets after one week or, as shown by others, in mice, when infections were separated by 35 days [41] . The timing of interference indicate that interactions between different viruses may also be important. It is possible that different mechanisms act on different virus combinations. Gene expression analysis of early markers of the immune response (ConA; B) . The number of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-producing cells was determined by an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. C-E, Sera were tested for antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09, by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (C); for total serum antibody binding to hRSV F protein, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; D); and for neutralizing serum antibody to hRSV Long or A2, by a ViroSpot microneutralization (MN) assay (E). Data were obtained from 2 ferrets per group.",

It is notable that infection with hRSV reduced morbidity induced by A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Although virus loads were not decreased in nasal wash specimens, virus shedding may be reduced in the lower respiratory tract, limiting clinical disease. IL-8 mRNA expression was elevated in nasal wash samples of ferrets infected with hRSV as compared to A(H1N1) pdm09. Increased IL-8 expression has been associated with milder disease in ferrets infected with pathogenic influenza virus strains, potentially mediated by rapid recruitment of neutrophils, which assist in clearing virus [42] . Analysis of the lung influenza virus loads in animals that have been infected with hRSV prior to challenge with A(H1N1)pdm09 would be of interest.",

Similarly, a delay of 2-4 weeks of the expected peak of hRSV was reported following an early influenza A season in the Netherlands. [3] . These population-level observations of viral interference arise from the interplay between (1) immunodynamics (ie, host-level viral interference), (2) heterogeneity between hosts (ie, differences in immunity to virus strains between individuals), and (3) transmission dynamics (ie, within or between different age groups) [43] . For influenza, these processes have been investigated in some detail. Others have demonstrated that a short period (ie, days rather than weeks) of viral interference at the host level may result in substantial separation between epidemic waves at the population level [43] . Our results provide the first hostlevel immunodynamic evidence in support of these processes driving the epidemiological interactions observed previously in Europe [1, 2] .",

Data are geometric mean titers (GMTs) and 95% confidence intervals from 4 ferrets. B, After undergoing primary infection with either A(H1N1)pdm09 or hRSV, ferrets were challenged 3, 7, or 11 days later with the alternate virus. Control animals in each experiment received only the challenge virus. Sera were collected 14 days after challenge, and neutralizing antibodies to the challenge virus were measured by the HI assay, for influenza virus, and by the VS MN assay, for hRSV. Primary and challenge infections are as follows: 10 3.5 TCID 50 of A(H1N1)pdm09 (primary infection) and 10 5 PFU of hRSV Long (challenge infection; Bi and Bii), 10 5 PFU of hRSV Long (primary infection) and 10 3.5 TCID 50 of A(H1N1)pdm09 (challenge infection; Biii and Biv), and 10 6 PFU of hRSV Long/A2 (primary infection) and 10 3.5 TCID 50 of A(H1N1)pdm09 (challenge infection; Bv and Bvi).
