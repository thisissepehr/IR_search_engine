Pattle was a physicist working at a Ministry of Defence laboratory at Porton Down when he noticed that nerve gases caused pulmonary edema foam in the rabbits he was studying. These bubbles remained stable for many hours. The usual antifoaming agents were ineffective and Pattle surmised that 'the air bubbles must be covered with a unique substance from the lining layers of the alveoli which made them so stable.' 3 He also speculated that 'absence of the lining substance may sometimes be one of the difficulties with which a premature baby has to contend.' At almost the same time John Clements ( Figure 2 ) working at the US Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Maryland was performing quantitative studies using a modified Wilhelmy balance. 4 Clements was a physiologist with no particular interest in the respiratory system until he was assigned the task of finding out how nerve gases damaged the lungs. In 1957, he published an article reporting the surface tension of films from the lungs of rats, cats and dogs. 5 Together with Chris Macklin, a pathologist working with phosgene in Canadian chemical warfare laboratories in 1954 6, 7 it is remarkable how they and Pattle came to the same conclusions independently and within a few months of each other.

Mel Avery was so impressed with Clements' 1957 article that she visited him in Edgewood to learn more about the surface film balance and adapt it to study extracts from the lungs of infants who had died soon after birth. In 1959, along with Jere Mead, she published a seminal article demonstrating that HMD, later known as RDS, was due to lack of surfactant. 8 The lungs of babies dying of HMD had a mean surface tension of about 30 dynes cm \u00c01 compared to about 8 dynes cm \u00c01 for those who died of other causes. Avery and Mead concluded 'hyaline membrane disease is associated with the absence or the late appearance of some substances which in the normal subject renders the internal surface capable of attaining a low surface tension when the lung volume is decreased.'

Soon after birth he was transferred to Boston Children's Hospital where he died 2 days later of HMD ( Figure 3 ). An obituary in the New York Times noted that at that time all that could be done 'for a victim of hyaline membrane disease is to monitor the infant's blood chemistry and to try to keep it near normal levels. Thus, the battle for the Kennedy baby was lost only because medical science has not yet advanced far enough to accomplish as quickly as necessary what the body could do by itself in its own time.' Patrick Kennedy's death from HMD increased public awareness of the disease and stimulated further research into its treatment. Within a few years two trials reporting the use of synthetic surfactants to treat RDS had been published. 9, 10 First synthetic surfactant trials Unfortunately, the results of these studies were largely negative; both had used nebulized dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and there were no discernible beneficial clinical effects. 9, 10 The results of the study by Jacqueline Chu et al., 10 conducted in Singapore, left the authors so disillusioned that they entitled their article 'Neonatal Pulmonary Ischemia' implying that the underlying cause of RDS was low pulmonary blood flow rather than a primary surfactant deficiency.

Together they produced a porcine surfactant that they named after themselvesFthe Curstedt-Robertson surfactant or Curosurf for short. This surfactant was unique in that, apart from being produced from pig lungs rather than cow lungs, it went through an additional preparation step of liquid gel chromatography, leaving only polar lipids and SP-B and SP-C with a phospholipid concentration of 80 mg ml \u00c01 . 15 Randomized trials with many surfactants The 1980s were the era of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) during which many different synthetic and natural surfactant preparations ( Figure 7 ) were assessed in treatment or prevention of RDS in preterm infants. 16 These surfactant preparations can be classified into one of five groups as follows: (1) old synthetic or protein free, (2) natural minced lung extracts, (3) natural lung lavage extracts, (4) natural amniotic fluid extract and (5) new synthetic protein analogues ( Figure 7 ). Human amniotic fluid-derived natural surfactant initially showed promising results 17 but had to be withdrawn from clinical use, without ever being licensed, when the risk of human immunodeficiency virus contamination became apparent. The old synthetic and the other natural surfactants were studied in many RCTs and both groups have been shown to reduce pulmonary air leaks and mortality. 18 The results have been summarized in three systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library by Roger Soll and his colleagues. [19] [20] [21] The Cochrane Library also contains systematic reviews demonstrating the benefits of multiple doses over a single dose, 22 early versus delayed selective treatment, 23 prophylaxis versus selective use 24 and natural versus old synthetic surfactant. 25 All of these interventions have survival benefits (Table 1 ) and help us to develop guidelines for surfactant treatment in preterm infants. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) to obtain one less death vary from 14 for multiple doses versus a single dose to 50 for natural surfactants versus synthetic surfactants ( Table 1 ). The technique of intubation to administer surfactant before extubation to CPAP known as INSURE also appears to have benefits over surfactant administration followed by continued mechanical ventilation although the reduction in mortality is not statistically significant. 26 Comparison of natural surfactants Natural surfactants differ from one another; all but one is bovine and some are derived from minced lung extracts and some from lung lavage extracts (Figure 7 ).

Five trials compared poractant alfa and beractant with Ramanathan et al. 27 reporting results of two different doses of poractant alfa (200 mg kg \u00c01 and 100 mg kg \u00c01 ), Bloom et al. 28, 29 reported three studies comparing calfactant and beractant, and in Europe there have been at least two studies comparing bovactant and beractant. 30, 31 The studies comparing poractant alfa and beractant were all of rescue treatment and used initial doses of either 200 mg kg \u00c01 or 100 mg kg \u00c01 in the poractant alfa arm compared to 100 mg kg \u00c01 in the beractant arms (Table 3 ). In the study by Ramanathan et al. 27 both doses of poractant alfa (100 mg kg \u00c01 and 200 mg kg \u00c01 ) were compared with one dose of beractant (100 mg kg \u00c01 ) and neonatal mortality was lowest in the higher dose poractant alfa group (3%) versus lower dose poractant alfa (6%) and beractant (8%). Similar reductions in mortality have been found in other trials that used a 200 mg kg \u00c01 initial dose 32, 33 (Table 3 ). If the Ramanathan et al. study is taken to report two separate trials, beractant versus two groups of poractant alfa-treated infants, then six comparative trials of these two natural surfactants can be considered with a total of 20 deaths in the poractant alfa group and 33 in the beractant group (Table 3) . A meta-analysis of these six comparisons using neonatal mortality as an outcome shows a reduction favoring poractant alfa (RR 0.57; 0.34 to 0.96) with NNT 20 (11 to 1000) 18 (Table 4) . When the three comparisons using an initial dose of poractant alfa of 200 mg kg \u00c01 are examined the RR is reduced to 0.29 (0.10 to 0.79) with NNT of 14 (8 to 50). However, when the 100 mg kg \u00c01 doses of each surfactant are compared the reduction in neonatal mortality is no longer significant (Table 4) . Babies treated with poractant alfa are more likely to need only one dose of surfactant, especially when the initial dose is 200 mg kg \u00c01 , which may have economic advantages. A recent study by Bhatia and colleagues assessed outcomes of surfactant-treated babies in the United States using the Premier's Perspective Clinical Database. 34 The three surfactants compared were poractant alfa, beractant and calfactant and the database of RDS-treated infants totalled just under 25 000 (Table 5) . For this cohort, the unadjusted mortality rates were 6.25, 8.15 and 8.31%, respectively. After adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, race, gender and transfer status odds ratios (ORs) for mortality of 1.28 for beractant and 1.47 for calfactant were obtained compared to poractant alfa. When a subset of over 10 000 infants with no missing data was evaluated the adjusted ORs for mortality increased to 1.52 for beractant and 1.60 for calfactant compared to poractant alfa. (Table 5 ) Also, these authors showed using the same database that lengths of hospital stay were reduced with poractant alfa compared to beractant and calfactant consistent with significant cost savings when the porcine surfactant is used to treat RDS. 34 In 2005, Bloom et al. 29 reported two prospective randomized clinical trials comparing calfactant and beractant. The prophylaxis trial enrolled 749 infants of 23 to 29 weeks' gestation, whereas the treatment trial enrolled 1361 infants weighing between 401 and 2000 g who needed mechanical ventilation with more than 40% oxygen for RDS within 36 h of birth. The primary outcome for both studies was survival to 36 weeks' corrected age without need for supplemental oxygen. The sample size estimates for both studies were about 2000 and an interim analysis was planned after 1000 babies had been enrolled in the treatment trial. 29 The reduction in inspired oxygen concentration was significantly faster for the calfactant-treated group compared to beractant during the first 24 h after treatment. Unfortunately, both trials were halted after 32 months because of poor enrollment. The primary outcome data were almost identical for both groups in both studies: 52% in both groups for prophylaxis and 57 and 59%, respectively, for calfactant and beractant in the treatment trial. The conclusions of the authors were clear and unambiguous: 'because of inadequate sample sizes, early trial closures prevent us from either accepting or rejecting our null hypotheses because of substantial risks of type-2 errors. Questions about relative safety and efficacy for surfactant preparations will remain unanswered until clinical investigators are willing to complete the difficult tasks involved in the participation of a large-scale, randomized, clinical trial'. 29 37 Curosurf versus Survanta 27 Baroutis et al. 38 Curosurf versus Survanta versus Alveofact 80 Ramanathan et al. 27 Curosurf (2) versus Survanta 293 Malloy et al. 33 Curosurf versus Survanta 58 Total 531 Bloom et al. 28 Infasurf versus Survanta 608 Infasurf versus Survanta (2) 2100 Van Overmeire et al. 30 Alveofact versus Survanta 131 Griese et al. 31 Alveofact versus Survanta 14 Comparison trials with a new synthetic surfactant Also in 2005, two trials comparing the new synthetic surfactant, lucinactant with other synthetic 35 and natural 36 surfactants were reported. Lucinactant was previously called KL4 surfactant and is a gel at both room and body temperature. In a prophylaxis trial, defined as treatment in the delivery suite within 30 min of birth, lucinactant was compared with colfosceril palmitate in a randomized trial conducted mainly in South America. 35 Over 1000 infants were enrolled in this comparison, which included a reference arm containing half the number of beractant-treated infants. The inclusion criteria were birth weight between 600 and 1250 g, successful intubation soon after birth and informed parental consent. The major primary outcome was RDS-related mortality through 14 days, which is an unusual endpoint for neonatal trials. The results for beractant and colfosceril palmitate were similar and significantly higher than for lucinactant (nearly 10% versus about 5%). 35 However, there were no significant differences among the three groups for mortality at 28 days, corrected age 36 weeks or survival to discharge; all more established endpoints for neonatal clinical trials. The second study compared lucinactant with poractant alfa and it was conducted largely in Europe with many babies recruited in Poland. 36 The entry criteria were as follows: estimated gestational age 24 to 28 weeks, rupture of the membranes for less than 2 weeks, birth weight between 600 and 1250 g, successful intubation at birth and signed informed parental consent. Randomization was after birth to either lucinactant or poractant alfa treatment and babies were stratified by both birth weight (600 to 1000 and 1001 to 1250 g) and center. The surfactants were given within 30 min of birth so it was not conventional prophylaxis (within 10 to 15 min of birth) but it was in the delivery suite. The initial dose of each surfactant was 175 mg kg \u00c01 , and this is also unusual, as poractant alfa has only been administered in doses of either 100 or 200 mg kg \u00c01 in previous studies. 27, 32, 33, 37, 38 The volumes of surfactant needed to deliver the doses of 175 mg kg \u00c01 were 5.8 and 2.2 ml kg \u00c01 , respectively, for lucinactant and poractant alfa. 36 In addition, lucinactant is a gel that needs to be warmed to 44 1C for 15 min in a water bath and later shaken to form a liquid before it can be instilled into the lungs. This would explain why it was not possible to administer this surfactant within 10 to 15 min of birth in these studies. 35, 36 The study design was also unusual in that it was a non-inferiority trial, 36 perhaps the first surfactant study to use this design. The primary outcome was survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days and to estimate a sample size a 20-year-old trial of treatment of severe RDS in babies using poractant alfa 39 was used. This older trial had a 50% mortality rate in the control arm and was probably an inappropriate comparator for this so-called prophylaxis study. 36 As a result the estimated sample size was only 496, much less than the 2000 estimated for the beractant versus calfactant trials. 29 The trial was designed to run for 12 months but had to be extended to 24 months because of slow recruitment. It was finally stopped early when less than half the estimated sample size had been attained; the results from 243 babies were presented in the article. 36 The reasons given for terminating the study were slow recruitment and lack of financial support in that resources were to be diverted to the South American trial. 35 For the primary outcome of survival without BPD at 28 days the figures were 37.8% in the lucinactant group and 33.1% in the poractant alfa group but at 36 weeks' corrected age the results were in the opposite direction with figures of 64.7% for lucinactant and 66.9% for poractant alfa. Nevertheless none of these differences was statistically significant. 36 The readers must decide if this study truly demonstrated equivalence or non-superiority of these two surfactant preparations as stated by the authors 36 or represented a substantial risk of a type-2 error as stated in the comparative trials of beractant and calfactant. 29 Basic science of the new synthetic surfactants Lucinactant is only one of many new synthetic surfactant preparations in various stages of development. 40 Lucinactant contains 2.7% KL4, DPPC/POPG in a ratio of 3:1 and 13.5% palmitic acid. It contains 30 mg phospholipids per ml and is suspended in buffer at pH 7.6 forming a gel until warmed to 44 1C. 35, 36 Another synthetic surfactant with SP-B fragments such as Mini-B has been tested in animal models but not yet studied in humans. 41 At least four different peptides have been shown to have clear effects both in vivo and in vitro but it is believed that a commercially produced surfactant is some time away. 42 To date it has not been possible to synthesize SP-B as it has a complex structure and although KL4 has been described as an SP-B mimic it seems to form a transmembrane a-helix making it more likely to function as an SP-C mimic. 40 SP-C itself is very hydrophobic and especially in pure form is structurally very unstable. 40 Recombinant SP-C has been used in a commercially produced surfactant called Venticute. 43 This has 2% rSP-C, DPPC/POPG in a ratio of 7:3 and 5% palmitic acid. It contains 50 mg phospholipids per ml and is a liquid suspension. 40 rSP-C surfactant has been studied in adults with ARDS 43 but not in neonatal RDS. Another surfactant containing SP-C33 is currently being studied in Stockholm but no clinical trials have yet been reported. 40 This synthetic surfactant contains 2% SP-C33, DPPC/POPG in a 7:3 ratio but no palmitic acid. It is a liquid suspension and can be concentrated to 80 mg phospholipids per ml. 40 In summary, it is possible to prepare physiologically active surfactants from mixtures of phospholipids and peptides but PEEP seems necessary for adequate alveolar stability in animal models of RDS and finally synthetic surfactant is probably not yet ready for the market. 40, 44 Methods of administration of surfactant Surfactants generally have been administered by intratracheal instillation. Colfosceril palmitate, one of the first synthetic surfactants approved for use, has been administered by both rapid instillation 45 and slow instillation through a side port adapter attached to the endotracheal tube. 46 However, clinical experience and the results of animal studies show that rapid instillation is more effective than slow instillation, at least for natural surfactants. Valls-i-Soler and colleagues showed that use of a dual lumen tube rather than disconnection from the ventilator led to fewer dosing problems. 47 To date, it has not been possible to demonstrate that surfactant can be successfully administered by nebulization, 48 although this remains an attractive route as it avoids intubation of the trachea. Four methods of administration that aim to reduce the duration of endotracheal intubation or avoid it altogether have been described. [49] [50] [51] [52] The INSURE method involves a short intubation to administer surfactant followed by extubation to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 49 Pharyngeal deposition of surfactant soon after birth has been reported by Kattwinkel and colleagues, 50 and in Italy Trevisanuto et al. 51 used a laryngeal mask to deliver surfactant, both with some success although the results of randomized trials are awaited. At a recent meeting in Ancona, Herting et al. presented a poster on surfactant administration in spontaneously breathing infants using a fine gastric tube. However, intubation for rapid instillation is still the method of choice for administration of surfactant. Early extubation to CPAP seems to be a plausible ideal but has not been adequately tested in clinical trials to date.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 154, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"},

RDS there are a number of other potential indications for surfactant therapy. Infants with meconium aspiration syndrome show some response to surfactant treatment but larger and more frequent doses are needed for these effects 52 and thus far no studies show improved survival. Similarly, infants with congenital pneumonia, especially those due to group B streptococcal infection, improve with surfactant treatment; however, the response is less marked than in infants with RDS. 53 Whether surfactant really alters the course of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia or not is still a question, 54 but infants with respiratory failure on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be decannulated earlier if treated with a natural surfactant. 55 To date, there have only been reports of relatively small case series of infants with acute respiratory distress syndrome RDS (ARDS), 56 early chronic lung disease (CLD) 57 and pulmonary hemorrhage 58 treated with surfactant. Some acute improvement in oxygenation usually occurs, but long-term benefits have not been reported to date. Recently Yeh et al. 59 from Taiwan reported, in a RCT of infants with RDS, delivery of budesonide to the lung by instilling it with beractant.

A meta-analysis of these prophylaxis versus rescue treatment trials was published by Egberts et al. 60 in 1997. Prophylaxis was defined as administration of surfactant in the delivery suite within 10 to 15 min of birth. Rescue treatment was generally undertaken when intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was needed with more than 40 to 50% oxygen. Prenatal steroid use was only about 20% and there were significant advantages for prophylaxis ( Table 6 ). The adjusted ORs demonstrate an approximate halving the odds of developing severe RDS, neonatal mortality and BPD in 28-day survivors favoring prophylaxis. In 2002 Walti and colleagues using the same database of three trials demonstrated significant reductions in intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the prophylaxis group 61 ( Table 6 ). The OR for all grades of IVH was 0.65 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.90) and for severe IVH this was 0.56 (0.35 to 0.89). For the subgroup of outborn infants the reduction in severe IVH was even more impressive (OR 0.11; 0.02 to 0.49). Three criteria can be used to help develop a protocol for surfactant treatment: type of surfactant, timing of treatment and the dose of phospholipids required. Current evidence favors the use of natural surfactants rather than the old protein-free synthetic surfactants, and it is too soon to say whether the new synthetic surfactants have a role to play and none is currently approved for treatment of the newborn. 40, 62 In regard to timing, the evidence favors prophylaxis for infants of less than 31 weeks' gestation and early treatment for others who develop signs of RDS. The dose of surfactant needed may depend upon timing, severity of illness and whether or not prenatal steroids were given. A recent study from the Vermont-Oxford Neonatal Network highlighted the advantages of early or prophylactic surfactant treatment for infants of 23 to 29 weeks' gestation. 63 This was a cluster randomized trial involving 114 neonatal intensive care units assessing the utility of a multifaceted intervention in promoting good practice as regards surfactant treatment. Neonatal units in the intervention group gave surfactant at a mean of 21 min after birth compared to 78 min in the control hospitals. Prophylactic surfactant use in the delivery suite increased from 18 to 55%. These researchers also found reductions in rates of IVHFall grades 33 to 28% and severe IVH 14 to 10%Fin the hospital group, giving surfactant earlier, 63 results in keeping with the meta-analysis of poractant alfa trials reported by Walti et al. 61 The suggested protocol for surfactant treatment is based upon early treatment and CPAP ( Figure 8 ). For gestational ages less than 27 or 28 weeks prophylaxis in the delivery suite would seem to be indicated based upon the currently available evidence. A dose of 100 mg kg \u00c01 is recommended (although this is not approved in the United States) as surfactant inactivation is unlikely at this time. For these immature infants an attempt to extubate to CPAP should be made soon after transfer to the neonatal unit and this is usually possible in infants with gestational ages over 24 weeks. For infants of 28 to 31 weeks' gestation early CPAP and surfactant treatmentFif intubation is needed for resuscitationFseem sensible recommendations. Early rescue treatment should be used with either 100 or 200 mg kg \u00c01 (only 200 mg kg \u00c01 is approved in the United States) when inspired oxygen concentrations are above 30%. The presence of chest X-ray appearances of RDS help to determine the need for early treatment. For infants of greater than 31 weeks' gestation initial observation and early CPAPFif respiratory distress appearsFseem sensible.
