While it is impossible to quantify the precise virus immunogenie dose to the mouse following contraction and recovery from a type 2 genital infection, it is probably less than is contained in two subcutaneous formaldehyde stabilised vaccinations each containing the antigenic content equivalent of 106 infected cells per mouse; indeed, it was quite clear that reduction of vaccine dosages by onehundredfold dramatically reduced protection levels (Tables 1 and 3, Figs. 1--6) . A second explanation merits speeulation, namely, that establishment of latent ganglionic virus involvement following a live type 2 genital infection inhibits further immunological response to challenge with the (particularly) homologous virus on the basis that \"familiarity breeds immunologicM contempt\".
