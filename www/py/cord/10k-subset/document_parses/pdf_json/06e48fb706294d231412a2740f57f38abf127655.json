In limited testing, and despite their H1-blocking activity, second-generation antihistamines have been ineffective in suppressing sneezing in patients with natural colds [15] [16] [17] [18] . These findings raise an interesting question about the mechanism of action of first-generation antihistamines in reducing sneezing in patients with colds and about the ineffectiveness of second-generation antihistamines in this setting. Also, natural cold studies have certain technical problems, such as difficulty in enrolling patients in the early stages of a cold, when treatment effects are most accurately measured [19] . Therefore, it would be desirable to confirm the results of the natural cold studies by testing a second-generation antihistamine in the rhinovirus challenge model, which provides more precision in the measurement of sneezing.

The sneeze reflex travels along peripheral nerves and through the medulla oblongata. The neuropharmacology of the sneeze involves H1, muscarinic, and nicotinic receptors. With colds, the sneeze reflex begins in the nose with the infection of nasal cells by a cold virus ( figure 4 ). There is no evidence that activation of basophils and mast cells with release of histamine occurs in colds; however, there is presumed stimulation of free nerve endings of the ethmoidal branch of the trigeminal nerve by inflammatory mediators known to be present, such as bradykinin [1] . The nerve impulse then travels along the afferent nerve fibers to the sensory trigeminal nucleus in the medulla oblongata and arrives at the adjacent sneeze center [26] [27] [28] . Via another synapse, the impulse then arrives at the parasympathetic superior salivary nucleus of the facial nerve. Here, it crosses a synapse and travels via the preganglionic fibers of the greater petrosal nerve to the sphenopalatine ganglion. Supporting this route of transmission in sneezing is the finding that injection of alcohol into the sphenopalatine ganglion blocks the sneeze reflex [29] . The impulse then travels across another synapse (mainly nicotinic, some muscarinic) and proceeds via postganglionic fibers to the synapses (muscarinic) of mucus glands and blood vessels, which are then stimulated. The resultant glandular secretion and vascular transudation restimulate the free nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve by which pathway the impulse is redirected to the trigeminal nucleus and, subsequently, to the sneeze center in the medulla. When the restimulation of the sneeze center is sufficient, the impulse is then directed by intramedullary fibers to the synapses of multiple respiratory centers in the reticular formation, and from there to the synapses of respiratory neurons of the vagus, phrenic, and intercostal nerves. Then, via nicotinic synapses, the nerve impulse stimulates the muscular contractions responsible for a sneeze.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 98, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 99, "end": 102, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 842, "end": 846, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 847, "end": 851, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 852, "end": 856, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1258, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 385, "text": "figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The nose is the first site at which histamine may be involved in the pathogenesis of sneezing and where an antihistamine might inhibit the sneeze reflex.

The anticholinergic activity of first-generation antihistamines would be expected to operate at these sites. This is supported by the welldocumented effect of first-generation antihistamines in reducing the volume of nasal fluid production during colds [3, 4] . The second afferent impulse to the medulla is again initiated by stimulation of the free nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve. Vascular transudation leads to release of kininogen with resultant generation of kinin [14] . This event provides a means for direct stimulation of free nerve endings by kinins as well as by histamine released from mast cells by kinin stimulation. This provides another possible target for the action of an antihistamine. Also, when the nerve impulse is redirected to the medulla, H1 and muscarinic synaptic sites may be blocked by first-generation antihistamines as described above. From that point on, when the motor neurons become involved, nerve transmission depends on nicotinergic receptors and thus would not be susceptible to the action of an antihistamine. This analysis suggests that an important site for the therapeutic effect of first-generation antihistamines on sneezing is in the medulla oblongata, where both H1 and muscarinic receptors may be involved. H1 receptors are known to be present in high concentrations in the hypothalamus, where histamine acts as a neurotransmitter to help regulate the level of wakefulness [14] . This accounts for the drowsiness associated with the use of first-generation antihistamines. Because of the dense concentration of H1 receptors in the hypothalamus, and because parasympathetic nerve fibers arise from and are activated by the hypothalamus, it is probable that histamine plays a role in signal transmission in this region.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 422, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 423, "end": 425, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1597, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "First-generation antihistamines are also known to be helpful in reducing the nausea associated with motion sickness [31] .

The antinausea effect of scopolamine depends partially on blocking of muscarinic receptors of the vestibular nuclei and the area postrema of the brain. Other nuclei in the brainstem may use the muscarinic receptor system as well, which supports the idea of muscarinic receptors in the CNS being part of the sneeze reflex. At present, information is not complete on the medullary synapses and neurotransmitters involved in the sneeze reflex, and further work is needed in this area; however, available information suggests that to be effective, a treatment for the sneezing of colds requires compounds that pass the blood-brain barrier and possess both H1 and muscarinic-blocking activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 120, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Clinical virology.
