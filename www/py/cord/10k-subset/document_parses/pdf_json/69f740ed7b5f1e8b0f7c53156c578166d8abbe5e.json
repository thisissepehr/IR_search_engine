Mathematically, the modelling of such systems is done on the level of stochastic master equations, giving likelihood functions for real live data [2] . We show in a case study of meningococcal disease, that the observed large fluctuations of outbreaks of disease among the human population can be explained by the theory of accidental pathogens, leading the system towards a critical state, characterized by power laws in outbreak distributions [3], [4]. In order to make the extremely difficult parameter estimation close to a critical state with absorbing boundary possible, we investigate new algorithms for simulation of the disease dynamics on the basis of winner takes all strategies [5] , and combine them with previously developed parameter estimation schemes [6] .",

            "text": "This scenario of accidental pathogens is best studied in cases where the disease is grave and the comensals omni-present, as in meningococcal disease. The accidental pathogen is found in large proportions of the host population, harmless carriage meningococci being as high as 20 to 30 percent in humans in certain age classes even in industrialized societies. Only rarely disease is caused, but then the symptoms are severe and often life threatening in meningitis and septicaemia caused by meningococci. The accepted clinical picture is that the bacteria live in the nasopharynx of their hosts without any noticable symptoms and are normally cleared off by the host's immune system after a short period of time. In order to escape the immune system the bacteria are highly mutable, especially in their membrane proteins, which are also responsible for attaching the bacteria to the nasal wall towards the blood stream. Here the mechanisms are highly disputed and subject to intensive research in medicine and microbiology (private communication, Martin Maiden). Clear again is the stage that when the meningococci have survived long enough in the host's blood stream or the meninges to release their metabolic by-products the host will suffer life threatening poisoning. The period between harmful acquisition of the bacteria (infection from other hosts) and the poisoning lasts only around a day. A model capturing especially the feature of mutation between harmless and potentially pathogenic infection shows that large outbreaks of disease (with power law distribution) occur when the pathogenicity (probability to cause a disease case) is small [2] ). The fact that a smaller probability to cause disease can lead to larger outbreaks is counter-intuitive when not taking the harmless carriage also into account, leading to near critical fluctuations.",

Because of the closeness to criticality, the outbreaks are highly variable, and hence difficult to estimate with standard procedures. In the literature, duration of carriage has been estimated between 11 months and a few weeks. The months estimates derive from carriage studies in schools, whereas outbreak data show seasonality and even short time adjustment to hosts' interactions (Stollenwerk, Maiden, Jansen (2004) [4] ).",

On the other hand, recent progress in obtaining rare events close to absorbing boundaries by artificially preventing absorbtion and subsequently reweighting of the realization, applied successfully to protein folding problems (e.g. Grassberger, Nadler, 2000, [7] ), provides a promissing a) way to speed up the parameter estimation also in situations such as described above in epidemiology.",
