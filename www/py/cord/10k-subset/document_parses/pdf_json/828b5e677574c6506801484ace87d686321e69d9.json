This overview will discuss a selection of technologies and provide an opinion about their utility, their pitfalls (summarized in table  1) , and their potential. Although the day when all diagnostic microbiology laboratories will routinely use molecular tools has not yet come [1, 2] , many clinicians believe that a plethora of such tests is readily available.

            "text": "Unknown extent of microbial DNA in \"normal\" host tissues Lack of necessary resources (human and economic) Reimbursement often not sufficient to cover costs today's infectious diseases trainees are still being trained in laboratories utilizing such resources. The new, younger laboratory workforce is not highly skilled in either the conventional or the high-tech environment, and microbiologists in general are in short supply. We are facing a knowledge and practice gap for the next 10-15 years, during which time molecular tools will gradually fulfill their promise. Even in those laboratories that are staffed with skilled microbiologists during the daytime, many critical test results are needed on the evening and night shifts, when the laboratories are staffed by nonspecialized laboratorians. As a result, physicians will have less trust in test results and will need to make a greater number of empirical decisions and use a greater number of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Another aspect of the dearth of experienced technologists is that testing has become more instrument based than discipline based. This is apparent in the migration of hepatitis and HIV serological testing from microbiology or virology departments to the immunochemistry laboratory, where generalists or chemistry technologists perform these tests along with tests for other serum factors, such as toxins and proteins. The testers are, in general, not knowledgeable about the agents for which they are testing, which could lead to interpretation errors or failure to recognize inappropriate results. It is difficult, at best, to validate test results (assuring the clinical utility, reliability, and reproducibility of results) using new technologies. Traditional culture-or antigen-based comparator methods often yield results that fail to correlate with the newer, more sensitive tests. Finding clinical criteria or alternate molecular targets to verify which result is correct can be tedious, expensive, and occasionally impossible. Obtaining adequate standards or positive patient samples to validate test results and to train performing technologists is also challenging. One example is PCR of CSF specimens for herpes simplex virus meningoencephalitis; this is considered to be the best diagnostic assay available, because cultures are insensitive, and brain biopsy is too invasive [4] . The difficulties in finding enough samples and in creating seeded samples with known viral loads for validation studies have prevented or delayed development of this and other tests in many laboratories [5, 6] . In fact, identical problems have impeded submission and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of commercial assays for herpes simplex virus. Some analyte-specific reagent test kits are available for both herpes simplex virus and enteroviruses, but they still require extensive in-house validation studies. The threat of an avian influenza pandemic may help spur the development of multiplex molecular assays for respiratory viruses [7] . The use of laboratory tests for diagnosis of enteroviral CNS disease was shown to be cost effective long ago [8] , but the availability of rapid molecular tests for this purpose has been long coming. In many circumstances, tests that infectious diseases physicians have heard about (e.g., at national meetings, such as that of the Infectious Diseases Society of America) will be available only as send-out tests to referral laboratories, accompanied by the attendant transportation problems and possible specimen degradation, delayed results, and costs. If an available molecular test is not performed in the local laboratory, one of the most important benefits-rapid results-is not realized, because the sample must be sent to a distant reference laboratory. Even after the newest generation of real-time molecular test systems, such as the GeneXpert test for group B streptococci (Cepheid), slated for FDA clearance as moderately complex, becomes available [9] , their initial cost may delay widespread implementation.",

Sample volume (which encompasses both original sample volume and number of nucleic acid sequences present in the final amplified sample portion), transport conditions, dilution factors, inhibitory factors, genome changes, instrument problems, and operator error all contribute to false-positive and false-negative test results [6, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Even closed systems at the detection end do not prevent cross-contamination from positive sample processing at the front end. For example, current FDA restrictions require that Papanicolaou smears be first performed when a single suspension of cervical cells is received in preservative, with requests for both cytology and for detection of human papillomavirus, Chlamydia species, and N. gonorrhoeae; this contributes to the common finding that insufficient sample size remains for the infectious diseases tests after the Papanicolaou sample has been removed [19] . Unfortunately, unlike direct visual examinations in which sample quality can be assessed, a negative result of such an assay includes no comment on the quality of the specimen. Although molecular tests that use whole blood samples for detection of the agents of sepsis are not yet available, several such assays are in development. Volume will be a factor in the sensitivity of these tests. The amount of bacteria in blood obtained from a patient with bacteremia is often !1 cfu/mL [20] , yet the volume used in most NAA reaction vials is !10 mL. Even if the sample is concentrated in some way, the chance that microbial genetic material will reach the reaction vial could be very small, resulting in false-negative results. In samples containing human neutrophils or erythrocytes-the very samples most likely to harbor the infectious agent-it is challenging to concentrate microbial DNA without also adding overwhelming amounts of human somatic DNA, and the available frontend methods (extraction and filtration columns, magnetic particle capture, and silica-based systems) still lack efficiency [21, 22] . Manufacturers are spending most of their energy on backend technology (detection and reporting). Front-end processing is urgently needed, ideally resulting in the development of a creative new method for concentrating cell-rich specimens (such as purulent fluid, blood, and sputum) from humans to allow for sensitive detection of microbial nucleic acids.",

Patients may have confounding signs and symptoms, the number of organisms in the CSF sample may be very low, and conventional tests are insensitive and/or slow. Direct acid-fast staining of CSF specimens has a sensitivity of \u223c52% [24] . The volume of CSF needed for adequate culture is at least 5 mL (preferably 10 mL), because Mycobacterium tuberculosis is extremely buoyant in CSF as a result of its waxy cell wall; thus, concentration by centrifugation is inefficient [25] . Smears for acid-fast bacilli made from the sediment must be layered and examined exhaustively-sometimes for 30 min-in the hope of detecting the rare M. tuberculosis rod [23] . NAA would seem to be the answer. Sadly, NAA tests display an overall sensitivity of 71% (range, 25%-100%) and a specificity of 95% (range, 92%-97%), as determined by a meta-analysis of 49 published studies, 35 of which used home-brewed (individual laboratorydeveloped and -validated) methods [26] . When results from the 14 laboratories that used commercially available assays were evaluated separately, the overall sensitivity decreased to 56% (range, 46%-66%). These are the assays that are likely to be available to most clinicians. The NAA results were equal to those for the acid-fast bacilli smear. Clinicians must realize that unwanted reliance on new technology may lead to diagnostic errors.",

Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, for example, are highly related and cannot be separated easily by standard sequencing methods [27] . Most clinicians realize that Escherichia coli and Shigella species are highly related [28] , but they have not considered the difficulty that this relatedness would pose if we relied on sequencing to identify these genera directly in patient samples.

It resembles the spherule of Coccidioides immitis, however, so it has long been considered an \"unculturable\" fungus. Recently, 18s rRNA sequencing placed the organism into a group of protozoan fish parasites [29] . We are constantly faced with new names for familiar organisms-and even with new organisms that may or may not be important in familiar syndromes. Before more-extensive testing was performed, the newly discovered Mycoplasma fermentans (originally called Mycoplasma incognitus) had been implicated in both Gulf War syndrome and HIV infection [30, 31] . It was later found to be quite common in humans [32] . After effective therapy, results of PCR of genital samples obtained from patients with C. trachomatis remain positive for 12 weeks [33] .

For example, the FDA has cleared a real-time PCR test for group B streptococcal vaginal/rectal colonization during labor [34] . Widespread use of this test could negate the need to perform cultures for pregnant women during weeks 35-37 of gestation, and it would solve the problems associated with treating women who present in labor without screening test results [35] . Currently, 25% of women receive prophylactic penicillin during labor [36] . This number would decrease if only women with PCR results positive for group B streptococci at labor were treated [36, 37] . The problem, however, is that current recommendations [38] have already reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease to less than the 2010 National Health Objective of 0.5 cases per 1000 live births, and additional improvement is not cost-effective [39] . Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital Johnson Center, a Stanford University Medical Center affiliate on the same campus, delivers \u223c1800 babies annually. To perform the PCR assay immediately after each sample is received (a necessity to assure that prophylaxis is administered for at least 4 h before delivery), we would have to staff 1 technologist at all times. Test performance takes \u223c15 min of hands-on time, and the test itself runs 45 min, so a technologist must perform continuous sample management. Twenty-four/seven staffing for 365 days per year would require 3.9 clinical laboratory scientists, at a labor and overhead cost of $316,875. The reagents-not counting the cost of the instrument itself-cost $46,800 annually, for a total yearly cost of $363,675. Stanford University Medical Center (Stanford, CA) patients have a colonization rate of 17% among women in labor, resulting in 306 babies at risk per year. To prevent 3 potential group B streptococcal infections using this test, the cost per infection avoided would be $121,225. This is a hard sell to hospital administrators who are focused on the bottom line. Potential laboratory staff labor savings with the use of random-access, moderately complex molecular systems, such as GeneXpert (mentioned above), may help to bring down costs.",

The spots of DNA or RNA on \"gene chips\" can be designed to be homologous with nucleic acid sequences in the sample, representing nucleic acids found in both the normal situation and the activated state of transcription or representing various genetic sequences unique to a vast array of microbes for detection of infectious agents [44] . Samples are treated to break down their DNA or RNA into small discrete sequences, for which an identical sequence exists on the chip. If the sample nucleic acid finds its match, it binds and emits an electronic signal [45] . Such a human-response chip can be used to determine a patient's response to potentially toxic antimicrobial treatments in advance of delivery. If the patient lacks enzymes to break down toxins or cannot metabolize a drug effectively, alternative therapies can be used to avoid dangerous adverse effects [46] . In another prospective microarray-based test, human leukocyte response to various infectious agents may be used to pinpoint the etiology before the agent itself can be detected [47] . Development of this sort of technology is on a fast track, to facilitate detection of bioterrorism agents before the symptomatic phase of disease renders widespread preventive measurements inadequate [48] . Proteomics is being used to fine-tune the development of new anti-infectives as well [49] . One aspect of microarray technol-ogy yet to be standardized and codified is the monumental problem of data analysis [50] . An entire new discipline of bioinformatics has developed for this purpose.

However, the shortcomings of these technologies must be recognized. Present dangers include failure to support the need for traditionally trained microbiologists, allowance of expertise to be moved to sites distant from patient care activities, inappropriate trust of new technology, and underestimation of the value of clinical diagnosis based on the acumen of experienced laboratorians and infectious diseases practitioners.",
