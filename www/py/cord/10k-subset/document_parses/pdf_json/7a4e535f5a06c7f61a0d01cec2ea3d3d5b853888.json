Artificial transcription factors are a potentially powerful molecular strategy for improving cellulase production in T. reesei. In this study, enhanced transcriptional activators XYR1VP, ACE2VP, and ACE1VP were constructed by linking the C terminus of XYR1, ACE2, or ACE1 with an activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein VP16. T. reesei transformants T XYR1VP , T ACE2VP , and T ACE1VP showed improved cellulase and/or xylanase production. T XYR1VP has a cellulase-free phenotype but with significantly elevated xylanase production. Xylanase I and xylanase II activities [U/(mg biomass)] increased by 51% and 80%, respectively, in T XYR1VP in comparison with parental strain RUT C30. The filter paper activity of T ACE2VP in the Avicel-based medium increased by 52% compared to that of RUT C30. In the Avicel-based medium, T ACE1VP manifested an 80% increase in FPase activity and a 50% increase in xylanase activity as compared to those of RUT C30. Additionally, when pretreated corn stover was hydrolyzed, crude enzymes produced from T ACE1VP yielded a greater glucose release than did the enzymes produced by parental strain RUT C30. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

Specific artificial transcriptional activators have been constructed to improve cellulase production in T. reesei (Su et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2016a Zhang et al. , 2017 Zhang et al. , 2018 ). An artificial transcriptional activator constructed by fusing the two DNA-binding domains of ACE1 and CRE1 with an effector domain of ACE2 can regulate the expression of cellulase genes (Su et al. 2009 ). T. reesei U3, a mutant strain with enhanced cellulase production, was identified via screening with construction of an artificial zinc finger protein library (Zhang et al. 2016a) . Similarly, transformant zxy-2 of an artificial transcriptional activator-containing the binding domain of CRE1 linked to the effector and binding domains of XYR1-yields constitutive cellulase production from glucose as the sole carbon source (Zhang et al. 2017) . A universal and simple pattern strategy for constructing a series of artificial transcriptional activators in T. reesei must be developed further. Recently, we improved cellulase production in T. reesei by substituting natural TFs with minimal transcriptional activators (Zhang et al. 2018 ) designed by linking one DNA-binding domain of ACE2 or CRE1 to the C-terminal 78 amino acid residues (aa) of herpes simplex virus protein VP16, which act as an activation domain that activates transcription of early viral genes (Sadowski et al. 1988; Triezenberg et al. 1988) .",

Three ETAs including XYR1VP, ACE2VP, and ACE1VP were designed by fusing the VP16 domain to the C terminus of XYR1, ACE2, and ACE1, respectively (Fig. 1) . The expression plasmids pXYR1VP, pACE2VP, and pACE1VP for the three ETAs were constructed by ligating the erasable hygromycin selection marker LML2.1 (Fig. 1) , which was eliminated by the product of a chimeric Cre recombinase gene (Zhang et al. 2016b ). The expression plasmids were introduced into the genome of the T. reesei hypercellulolytic mutant RUT C30 by Agrobacteriummediated transformation to replace natural TFs XYR1, ACE2, and ACE1 by homologous double exchange ( Fig. 1) , eliminating the risk of random insertion and unpredictable mutagenesis. The transformed strains with confirmed gene replacement were selected to eliminate the hygromycin selectable marker by xylose induction to obtain the final transformants. All the transformants were identified as correctly transformed ETA strains and harbored single-copy DNA integration (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Three randomly screened transformants T XYR1VP -1/-2/-3, T ACE2VP -1/-2/-3, and T ACE1VP -1/-2/-3 for each ETA were analyzed further.",

Regardless of the carbon sources, growth rates of transformants T ACE2VP and T ACE1VP were not significantly different from that of the control (Fig. 2a-c) . Thus, ACE2VP and ACE1VP had no effect on basic cellular metabolism. Similarly, the growth of T XYR1VP showed no significant differences from the control when cultured in glycerol (Fig. 2a) . Nevertheless, the growth rates of T XYR1VP on lactose and Avicel were much lower than the growth rate of the control, with growth on Avicel being particularly slow (Fig. 2b, c) , indicating that XYR1VP limits cellulase synthesis in T XYR1VP .",

T XYR1VP manifested nearly no filter paper activity (FPA) in the Avicel-or lactose-based medium (Fig. 3A) . Similarly, the p-nitrophenol-d-cellobioside hydrolase (pNPCase), the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose hydrolase (CMCase), and the 4-nitrophenyl-betad-galactopyranoside hydrolase (pNPGase) activities in T XYR1VP were nearly absent as compared to the control ( Fig. 3B-D) . Additionally, the transcript levels of cellulase-related genes cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2 were low compared to those in the control (Fig. 3E , F), suggesting that XYR1VP abrogated cellulase production. Consequently, the dramatically decreased growth rate of T XYR1VP on Avicel resulted from its cellulase-negative phenotype in the presence of inducing carbon sources (Avicel and lactose). A lack of cellulase hindered the growth of T XYR1VP in the Avicel-based medium. The , CMCase (C), and pNPGase (D) activities of RUT C30 and T XYR1VP after a switch from glycerol to 20 g/L Avicel or lactose. Enzymatic activities were measured at 2, 3, and 4 days after the transfer. Error bars show the respective standard deviations of three biological replicates; asterisks indicate significant differences (*P \u2264 0.05; **P \u2264 0.01; ***P \u2264 0.001; n.s. not significant) between the transformants and RUT C30, as assessed by Student's t test. Expression ratios of cellulase-related genes on 20 g/L Avicel (E) or lactose (F) for 12 and 24 h after the switch from glycerol. Data on T XYR1VP transformants were normalized to the corresponding gene expression levels at the same time points in RUT C30. Values represent the mean of three biological replicates, and the error bars denote standard deviations. Gene expression ratios greater than twofold or less than 0.5-fold are marked with \"a\" cellulase-free phenotype was observed not only in XYR1VP transformants but also in ACE3VP transformants, in which the strong transcriptional activation domain of VP16 was fused to the C terminus of ACE3 (data not shown).",

By contrast, overexpression of xyr1 has been found not only to markedly enhance xylanase activity but also to increase cellulase activity in transformants (Mach-Aigner et al. 2008; Uzbas et al. 2012) . Therefore, we hypothesized that the C-terminal fusion of XYR1 would alter the function of XYR1VP. Using COILS (Lupas et al. 1991; Lichius et al. 2015) predicted that the C terminus of XYR1 is a coiledcoil domain and likely mediates homodimerization of XYR1. Therefore, fusing the VP16 activation domain at the C terminus of XYR1 abrogated the expression of cellulase genes in T. reesei. It is very important to study the function of the C terminus of XYR1. Nonetheless, the positive effect on xylanase gene expression observed after fusion of the VP16 activation domain indicated distinct regulatory mechanisms between cellulase and xylanase genes in terms of transcription. The different responsiveness of XYR1 to cellulase and xylanase was also observed by Pucher et al. (2011) . Notably, the cellulolytic regulon of XYR1 is positively affected, whereas the xylanolytic regulon is affected negatively in a T. reesei QM9414 strain constitutively expressing xyr1 (Pucher et al. 2011 ). These different regulatory mechanisms for cellulase gene transcription are supported by in silico identification of XYR1-binding sites in promoter regions, which are reported to occur at dramatically different frequencies in the promoter region of cbh1 and xyn1: 14-fold for cbh1 and only 4-fold for xyn1 (Rauscher et al. 2006; Furukawa et al. 2009 ).",

Moreover, the transcript levels of bgl1, xyn1, and xyn2 in T ACE2VP showed no significant differences in the lactose-or Avicel-based medium as compared to the control (Fig. 4D , E; Additional file 1: Figure S3d , e). One study revealed no effect on xyn1 expression in strains in which ace2 was deleted (Aro et al. 2001) . It is possible that xylanase production was not improved in T ACE2VP because ACE2 did not affect xyn1 expression, as was the case for ACE2VP. ACE2 can affect the expression of xyn2 and bgl1 (Aro et al. 2001; Stricker et al. 2008) . Additionally, phosphorylation and dimerization are prerequisites for ACE2 to bind the promoters of target genes (Stricker et al. 2008) . Fusion of the VP16 domain to the C terminus of ACE2 may influence the native effects on xyn2 and bgl1 expression.",

The amount of protein secreted from T ACE1VP notably increased (Additional file 1: Figure S4a ). Additionally, elevated cellulase activities were observed in T ACE1VP as compared to those in the control in both Avicel-and lactose-based media (Fig. 5A-D) . Cellulase production by T ACE1VP was higher in the Avicel-based medium than in the lactose-based medium. The highest FPase activity of T ACE1VP transformants was 3.2 \u00b1 0.2 U/ mL in the Avicel-based medium, with an increase in activity of approximately 80% on day 4 compared to that in the control; this result is consistent with the enhanced pNPCase, CMCase, and pNPGase activities (Fig. 5B-D) .

Gene expression ratios greater than twofold or less than 0.5-fold are marked with \"a\" rose by nearly 50% in the Avicel-based medium as compared to the control (Additional file 1: Figure S4b , c). These results suggested that ACE1VP promotes cellulase and xylanase production in both Avicel-and lactosebased media. It has been reported that ace1 is a repressor and deleting ace1 increases the amounts of cellulase produced in T. reesei (Aro et al. 2003) . Here, ACE1VP is an artificial TF that promotes cellulase production. ACE1VP did not elevate the transcript level of itself but promoted the transcript levels of the cellulase genes and of transcriptional activators xyr1 and ace3. Therefore, ACE1VP harbors positive transcriptional effects for cellulase production, whereas native ACE1 had a negative effect on cellulase production.",

The increased glucose release resulted from enhanced pNPGase activity in T ACE1VP , which can hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose. There was no significant difference in the amount of glucose released between the crude enzymes from T ACE2VP and the control (Additional file 1: Figure S5 ); these data are in agreement with the unimproved level of pNPGase activity from T ACE2VP in comparison with the control.

The crude enzymes from T ACE1VP or RUT C30 were either supplemented with \u03b2-glucosidase (Sunson Enzymes) (T ACE1VP +, RUT C30+) or not supplemented with \u03b2-glucosidase (T ACE1VP , RUT C30) at the CBU/FPA ratio of 2. Commercial cellulase CTec2 (Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) served as the control. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed at 15 FPA/(g pretreated corn stover). Values represent the mean and standard deviation of triplicate measurements been described in other reports too (Zhang et al. 2017 (Zhang et al. , 2018 , suggesting that the cellulase secreted by strain RUT C30 contains insufficient amounts of \u03b2-glucosidase (Pryor and Nahar 2015; Li et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016a ). The T ACE1VP strain showed higher \u03b2-glucosidase activity, which might be the reason for the improved hydrolysis yield with T ACE1VP .",

XYR1VP significantly improved xylanase gene transcription, while it abrogated cellulase gene expression. ACE2VP improved cellulase production in both lactose and Avicel media but was ineffective at inducing pNPGase and xylanase production. Moreover, ACE1VP functioned as a positive regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression. This is the first study to report the effects of ETAs on cellulase and xylanase production; these data are helpful for strain improvement of T. reesei. Additionally, our universal and simple pattern strategy for constructing ETAs can serve as an alternative genetic engineering method for increasing the yield of industrial products in other hosts.",
