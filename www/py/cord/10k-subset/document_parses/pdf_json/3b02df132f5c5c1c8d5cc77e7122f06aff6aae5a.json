However, the treatment -related death of a patient with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency following adenovirus administration by hepatic artery has led to serious concerns regarding the safety of intravascular adenovirus. Both replication -incompetent ( rAd.p53, e.g., SCH58500 ) and replication -selective ( dl1520, aka Onyx -015; CG7870 ) oncolytic adenoviruses, by intravascular administration, are in clinical trials. We review Phases I and I / II results from these clinical trials. dl1520 and rAd.p53 were well -tolerated following hepatic artery infusion at doses of up to 2\u00c210 12 and 2.5\u00c210 13 particles, respectively. At a dose of 7.5\u00c210 13 particles, rAd.p53 was associated with dose -limiting cardiac output suppression; dl1520 dose escalation did not proceed higher than 2\u00c210 12 . Intravenous ( i.v. ) infusions of dl1520 and CG7870 have been well tolerated by i.v. infusion at doses of 2\u00c210 13 and 6\u00c210 12 , respectively, without identification of a maximally tolerated dose to date. Mild / moderate transaminitis was demonstrated in some patients on both the hepatic arterial and i.v. trials at doses ! 10 12 particles. Interleukin ( IL ) -6 and IL -10 were induced in a dose -dependent manner in most patients, but significant interpatient and intrapatient ( on repeat doses ) variabilities were demonstrated.

Initially, mutants with deletions in one or more critical viral genes (e.g., E1, E4 ) were constructed as replication -incompetent vehicles to deliver therapeutic genes including tumor-suppressor genes, prodrug -activating enzymes, or cytokines. 1 -3 Adenoviruses expressing p53 were demonstrated to have selective antitumoral effects, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Of note, replacement of p53 alone was enough to kill tumor cells with a great number of genetic alterations. Subsequently, adenoviruses were engineered to replicate selectively within cancers. 4 The original approach proposed by McCormick was to delete the E1B -55 kDa gene. 5 This gene product was known to bind p53 ( in complex with E4orf6 ), leading to p53 inhibition and /or degradation. The theory was that E1B -55 kDa -deleted adenoviruses such as dl1520 ( later designated Onyx -015 ) would not be able to inactivate p53 in normal cells and, as a result, the viral replication cycle would not be completed. In cancer cells lacking normal p53 function, however, replication was predicted to proceed. Subsequently, other gene deletion mutants were evaluated to target tumor cells lacking G1 -S checkpoint control and /or loss of pRB function. 6, 7 A subsequent approach to emerge was construction of replication -selective adenoviruses by placing the expression of E1A under control of tumor / tissue -specific promoters. 8 -10 This approach has been used with PSA, E2F, AFP, and other promoters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 331, "end": 335, "text": "1 -3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 657, "end": 658, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 739, "end": 740, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1314, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1316, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1496, "text": "8 -10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Whereas these approaches both held promise, the initial clinical trials with these agents were limited to cancers for which intratumoral ( i.t. ) injection was feasible in order to maximize safety.

Once safety and gene expression or replication was demonstrated with i.t. injection, e.g., with dl1520, intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injections were performed in patients with ovarian carcinoma. 13 After safety and feasibility of i.p. delivery to ovarian cancer patients were demonstrated, intravascular administration was contemplated. However, the feasibility of vascular delivery to tumors in the face of innate immunity and neutralizing antibodies was unknown. The dose -limiting toxicity in mice was typically hepatotoxicity with adenovirus vectors. 14 Finally, the tragic death of a patient on an adenoviral gene therapy trial for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC ) deficiency at the University of Pennsylvania eventually raised serious concerns about the safety of intravascular adenovirus administration and led to numerous trials in the US and Europe being put on hold. 15 -18 We summarize publicly disclosed and /or published data on clinical trials of intravascular adenovirus in cancer patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 222, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 486, "end": 488, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 846, "end": 848, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1175, "text": "15 -18", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Therapeutic adenoviruses dl1520 ( aka Onyx -015 ) dl1520 ( Onyx -015 ) is a first -generation replication -selective adenovirus type 2/ 5 chimera with a deletion in the E1B -55 kDa gene, 19 as well as the E3 10.4/ 14.5 and 14.7 genes. The virus contains a deletion between nucleotides 2496 and 3323 in the E1B region encoding the 55 -kDa protein. In addition, a C -to -T transition at position 2022 in E1B generates a stop codon at the third codon position of the protein. These alterations eliminate expression of the E1B -55 kDa gene in Onyx -015-infected cells. Because E1B -55 kDa binds to and inactivates the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product, this mutant should theoretically be unable to overcome the p53 -mediated blockade of viral replication in a normal cell. 20 In a tumor cell lacking p53 function, in contrast, the E1B -55 kDa protein should be expendable for p53 inhibition and replication should proceed. 21 Initial studies demonstrated p53 -dependent selectivity in matched cells with and without dominant -negative p53.

Several factors may account for these apparent differences in safety. One plausible explanation is that the patient populations enrolled onto these two trials differed in their sensitivity to viral infection and the ensuing systemic inflammatory response. Patients with OTC deficiency have a well documented heightened sensitivity to viral and bacterial infections compared to the general population, and that hyperammonemia, ARDS, and death can result. 42 Unfortunately, the OTC patient reportedly had an elevated blood ammonia level prior to treatment on the trial.

The cellular changes induced by viral infection are often strikingly similar to the cellular changes acquired during carcinogenesis (e.g., p53 tumor-suppressor protein inactivation, inhibition of apoptosis ). Given this genetic convergence, it is not surprising that many viruses inherently grow preferentially in tumor cells and /or that viruses can be engineered for tumor selectivity. Five general mechanistic approaches to tumor-selective replication have been described to date. These include ( a) the use of viruses with inherent tumor selectivity ( e.g., NDV, reovirus, VSV, autonomous parvovirus ); 47 ( b) deletion of entire genes ( e.g., HSV, adenovirus ) 48 or ( c) functional gene regions (e.g., adenovirus, poliovirus ) 6 that are necessary for efficient replication and/ or toxicity in normal cells but are expendable in tumor cells; (d ) engineering of tumor /tissue -specific promoters into viruses to limit expression of gene( s ) necessary for replication to cancer cells (e.g., adenovirus, HSV ); 8 and ( e) modification of the viral coat to target uptake selectively to tumor cells ( e.g., adenovirus, poliovirus). 49, 50 Several encouraging strategies are being explored to improve the potential utility of these agents. First, because replication -selective viral treatment should not lead to cross -resistance with standard therapies, combinations with radiotherapy and chemotherapy may lead to additive or synergistic efficacy; 25,29 viral replication does not appear to be completely blocked by these agents. Endogenous viral gene expression can be modified to enhance antitumoral potency; examples with adenovirus include reintroduction or overexpression of the adenovirus death protein, 51 deletion of the E1B -19 kDa gene, or deletion of the E1A CR2 region. 6 Viral replication within tumors can lead to induction of cytokines with antitumoral and antivascular properties, as well as tumor-specific CTL. Viruses can be ''armed'' to express exogenous therapeutic genes including cytokines or prodrug -activating enzymes. 52 Finally, strategies to immunomodulate the host are being explored. For example, antibody clearance from the blood and complement inhibition are strategies that have been used in murine tumor models with adenoviruses and HSV, respectively.", "cite_spans": [{"start":
