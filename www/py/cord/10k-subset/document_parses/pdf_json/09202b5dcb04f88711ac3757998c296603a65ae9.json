These children did not have a malaria infection during the first 90 days of follow-up. There was significantly increased seroreactivity to epitopes in domains 1, 2, and 3 following AMA1 vaccination among the 10 children whose sera were probed on the peptide array (p < 0.01 all tests, Wilcoxon sign-rank test, Supplementary Fig. S3E ).

Among AMA1-vaccinated children, 90 days after vaccination, there was no detectable change in seroreactivity to AMA1 peptides residing outside of the 449 amino acid vaccine construct (positions #83-#531) ( Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3E ).

Monoclonal antibody 5A6, a known strain-specific, malaria inhibitory antibody that binds to a strain-specific domain-2 epitope, bound significantly to five AMA1 variants on the array above Dengue virus mAb control. The magnitude of seroreactivity to AMA1 variants of mAb MRA-479A (N3-2D9) and MRA-480A (N3-1D7) were highly correlated ( Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4 , p < 0.0001, Pearson's r = 0.89, r 2 = 0.79). MAb 479 A is described as a <30% inhibitory antibody of malaria parasite FVO, and mAb 480 A has no known inhibitory activity. The exact binding locations of mAb 479 A and 480 A are not known. The binding loci for N3 negative control mAb DEN3; raised against dengue virus serotype 3, did not bind to AMA1 variants above empty-vector control features, yet bound to pan-IgG positive control features printed on the array (Fig. 4A ).

Peptide arrays are more expensive, and the analysis is labor-intensive, limiting their feasibility for routine sero-surveillance. Whole-protein arrays are relatively robust and inexpensive, and results can be reported within hours. While protein arrays are being developed for use in the field, like ELISA, they cannot easily characterize strain-specific or polyclonal antibody responses. The translation of these platforms into practical tools for seroepidemiology will require the thoughtful use of informative, strain-transcending biomarkers and economies of scale. Vaccine research may benefit from employing high-resolution peptide microarrays early in development to assess the strain-specificity of functional monoclonal antibodies and the serological responses to vaccination well before vaccines against malaria or other pathogens that use genetic diversity to evade the immune system are taken to the field for testing in humans.",

P. falciparum malaria transmission coincides with the rainy season between June and November.

The total annual entomological inoculation rate per person is estimated to be from 50 to 150 infected bites 42 . The vast majority (97%) of malaria infections are due to P. falciparum, with rare P. malariae, and P. ovale infections. Children under six years of age vary in their risk of clinical malaria episodes, ranging from none to more than four clinical episodes of malaria per year, depending on neighborhood of residence 42,43 .

Regions that were 100% conserved (green) among all of the infecting strains and 3D7, differed by at least one amino acid (red) are indicated below. (C) Single amino acid changes result in significant changes in seroreactivity to cluster 1 loop peptides in Malian children 90 days after AMA1 vaccination. Bar plot with mean normalized signal +/\u2212 standard error of seroreactivity among children (n = 6) 90 days post-vaccination with AMA1. Colors denote polarity of the amino acid substitution; non-polar (green), polar (yellow), basic (blue), acidic (red), and deletion of the amino acid at position 197 (black). Dashed blue line indicates a normalized signal of 1, the theoretical value where all mutations produce equal signal. Cluster 1 loop peptides containing vaccine-strain 3D7 glutamic acid at position 197 (E197) of the cluster 1 loop had the highest reactivity to AMA1-vaccinated Malian children.
