However, since vaccine-induced immune protection against specific microbes takes more than a couple of weeks to develop and postexposure vaccination is only exceptionally a useful tool, combination with passive immunization is indispensable (e.g., treatment against the rabies virus. reviewed in ref 7) . when instant protection or treatment is required. Therapeutic vaccines are still in the exploratory stage of development and more prone to find their application in the treatment ofchronic infectious diseases,8.9rather than to become an immediate measure against a sudden infectious threat. On the other hand. most vaccines seem to confer protective immunity to the vaccinated individuals by the means to induce specific antibodies that capture the invading microbe. prior it had an opportunity to colonize in the exposed host. The so-called \"passive vaccination\" i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections. Already the pioneers of early microbiology and immunology in the late 19th century, led by their prominent proponents. Emile Roux and Emil von Behring, have realized the concept of \"passive vaccination\", namely that sheep and horses inoculated with filterable toxin extracts derived from Corynebacterium diphteriae cultures were able to mount an \"anti -toxin\" in their blood. Serum derived from the animals' blood was able to rescue children in the lethal stage of the infection caused by the same pathogen. Revisiting this historical landmark therapy of diphtheria, it was realized that the \"anti-toxin\" in the serum ofinoculated animals is synonymous with a protein species coined today antibodies and the \"toxin\" with a virulence factor secreted by the pathogen during infection. Thus , the remarkable and groundbreaking therapy concept explored more than 100 years ago, has paved the way to \"passive immunization\". i.e., all kind of serum-treatments that have found their broad medical applications in prevention of e.g.\u2022viral infections or in emergency treatments against e.g., snake venoms.\" :\" Serum antibodies against microbes and even isolated antigens, like the diphtheria toxin. are polyclonal, meaning that they bind-in case of a specific antigen molecule-to a variety of sites or-in case of a microbe-to multiple surface structures.",

The method was first applied to the genome-wide identification of in vivo expressed antigens from S. aureusby using antibodies from human serum and comprehensive small-fragment genomic surface display libraries .P Subsequently, the technology was extended with an integrated approach for antigen validation as selected clones are directly subjected to generation ofepirope-specific immune sera for surface localization and in vitro functional assays. This feature allows the analysis of antigens without the demanding task ofhigh through-put recombinant protein production. This method, named antigenome technology, has been extended to many important human pathogens and validated by the discovery ofnovel and highly protective antigens, in addition to the identification ofthe majority of the one s that have been previously described.P Since the antigenome technology provides a subset of all genome-encoded proteins, which are expressed by the pathogen in vivo and induce antibodies in humans, the identified antigens fulfill major requirements ofvaccine candidate antigens. It is interesting to note that the antigens confined by the antigenome seem ofien to be involved , as secreted and surface bound proteins, in virulence functions and , thus , being attributed to the \"parhosphere\" that has been defined as the growing gene pool in which pathogens meet and mingle to cause diseases.48lt is observed that many ofthe identified antigens from various pathogens were not or only very weakly expressed under in vitro growth conditions, indicating that a proteomic approach that preferentially selects abundant proteins would likely fail to identify them. As the bioinformatic genome mining approach depends on the accuracy of available algorithms, potential vaccine candidates can be missed due to a misleading or not existing annotation. Based on the analysis of the antigenomes of fifteen pathogens. approximately 25% ofall identified antigenic proteins can only be assigned to hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown function. Many ofthe identified antigens would, thus. be not be found by a bioinformatic approach. The cumulative data obtained fur the fifteen antigenomes showed that a large fraction ofthe antigens identified by this method represents cell surface or secreted proteins. Nearly fifty percent of all antigens fell into four cellular role categories: cell wall, cellular processes, transport and binding proteins and determinants of protein fate. In order to pinpoint candidates for vaccine development, a comprehensive and rapid validation strategy to retrieve the most promising antigens from the 100-200 antigens was implemented. Clones selected from peptide display libraries are directly subjected to generation of epitope-speci6c immune sera used fur testing of surface localization and in in vitro bactericidal assays.The human immunogenicity of identified antigens is evaluated with synthetic peptide epitopes. The application ofthese major selection criteria combined with traditional gene conservation studies reduces the antigenome to a small number ofcandidate proteins that can be rapidly expressed in recombinant form fur subsequent in vivo studies. The re-idenrification ofmost ofthe previously identified protective antigens of Staphylococci and Streptococci. such as PspA. M1 protein. Sip and ClfA gives further supports the power of the antigenome technology. Most importantly. novel protective proteins yielding animal protection in animal vaccine models. were found in the prioritized groups of antigens derived e.g., from S. aureus 23 and Streptococcus pneumoniae (unpublished data) , respectively. Thus, the utilization ofprotective antigens-included in subunit vaccines-as targets for monoclonal antibodies, provides an attractive strategy to develop novel treatments against life threatening infections. Such a notion is supported by recent data showing that protection can be conferred to naive animals, using serum directed against target antigens that have been validated in vaccine models (Nagy et al, personal communication).",

Last but not least, the increasingly wide usageof monoclonalantibodiesoutside of the infectionsdisease area has certainlyaided in loweringthe costsof developmentand manufacturing,therebypavingthe wayto noveltreatments.! Thequestion remainswhat kind of features form the prerequisites for a monoclonalantibody in order to be able to counteract a bacterialinfection?The answerto this problem lies-to our opinion-in the sdection of the bestsuitableantigenictargetsfor the developmentofmonoclonal antibodies. Theantigensshouldbeexpressed on the pathogensurface duringthe infectiousprocess; preferredthroughout the mostimportant stages ofdisease manifestation: i.e., duringcolonization, spreading and invasion. Also the antigens of choice should have a proven record to be a target of antibodies from individuals who haveencountered the pathogen with positiveor protective outcome. In addition, the selectedantigensshould be conservedamong all clinicalstrains of the germ causingthe underpinning infections. All up to here listed features of target antigens may suffice the need to detect the intruder with a monoclonal antibody. particularly ifthe bound antibody funnels the bacterium into the immunological decontamination program, e.g.\u2022 opsonization. On the other hand, the lesson learnt from antibiotics is that they have to kill the pathogen or at least disable bacterial growth in the host. In the light of the notion that prevention or treatment ofa bacterial infection with monoclonal antibodies may be restricted to a single antibody. one would aim the target antigen also to exert a function needed for bacterial survival in the host . Thus, the antibody will neutralize a virulence factor or an enzyme needed in the infections life cycle of the pathogen. Such a dual mode of action resembles the features of monoclonal antibodies employed in cancers therapy: these antibodies seem to block cancerous cells by marking them for the immunological destruction, but also by blocking their growth. Thus. monoclonal antibodies need to bedirected against carefully selected antigenic targets in order to achieve an optimum ofinterference with bacterial survival in the host.",
