These studies help explain the lower mortality in children compared with adults seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic and in many other types of acute illness. This difference is probably the heritage of human evolution. Understanding the scientific basis for this difference suggests an alternative way to respond to the next pandemic. Instead of relying on vaccination and antiviral treatment, we might be able to treat patients with inexpensive generic drugs that modify the host response to acute critical illness. Unlike pandemic vaccines and antiviral treatments, these drugs will be available in any country with a basic healthcare system. If laboratory and clinical research convincingly demonstrates this approach works, it would benefit people everywhere. This idea has been discussed several times in the past decade [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

This explanation is incomplete and unsatisfactory for several reasons. Children were infected with the 1918 virus more frequently than adults ( Fig. 1 ) and they were almost certainly colonized with the same bacteria that were associated with bacterial pneumonia in adults, yet their pneumonia mortality rates were much lower [6, 12] . More important, lower mortality among children compared with adults was not unique to the 1918 pandemic. Children have lower mortality than adults due to infections caused by many bacteria (e.g. Group A Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and M. tuberculosis) and viruses (e.g. mumps, varicella, poliomyelitis, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis E, yellow fever, SARS and smallpox). Similar mortality differences have been seen in several other conditions (e.g. disseminated C. albicans infection, acute lung injury accompanying severe malaria, sickle cell chest syndrome, multi-organ failure following severe trauma, severe burn injury and febrile neutropenia) [6, 10] . In short, lower mortality rates among children were not unique to the 1918 pandemic.",

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, children 5-14 years of age who were living in remote, isolated communities were often the only ones to survive [14] . There is general agreement that pandemic mortality peaked in young adults, but it was much lower in adults 45 years of age (Fig. 1) . Their lower mortality is thought due to the protective effect of residual immunity following exposure to H1N1-like viruses that circulated before an H3N2-like virus (Russian influenza) appeared in the early 1890s [10] . Influenza virologists agree that antigenic priming following infection with these earlier H1N1viruses (known as 'original antigenic sin') provided some measure of long-lasting protection against the highly virulent H1N1 virus that emerged in 1918 [15] . Accordingly, individuals born after the early 1890s were exposed only to H3N2-like viruses and would have missed antigenic priming with pre-1890 H1N1-like viruses. As young adults in 1918, they were susceptible to infection with the new pandemic H1N1 virus.",

This phylogenetic understanding has informed recent age-specific analyses (based on individual birth year) of mortality patterns before, during and after the 1918 pandemic [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Worobey et al. have used a hostspecific molecular clock approach to demonstrate that high mortality in young adults may have been due to childhood exposure to a doubly heterosubtypic putative H3N8 virus that circulated from 1889 to 1900 [19] . They think that young children (but not infants) were protected by childhood exposure to a newly emerged (post-1900) H1variant or N1 antigens. Miller et al. interpret the historical data more cautiously [18, 20] . They agree with Worobey et al that early life antigenic imprinting might have led to a dysregulated T-cell response that increased the risk of death following infection in 1918 with a new and antigenically dissimilar influenza virus. However, they question whether a new H1 virus emerged in the early 1900s to replace the H3 virus that first appeared in 1890.",

A similar uncertainty has arisen about influenza vaccination. The doctrine of 'original antigenic sin' was developed following observations that influenza vaccination led to the anamnestic recall of antibodies to earlier influenza viruses [15] . Recent epidemiologic studies, however, suggest that repeated influenza vaccinations may lead to reduced vaccination effectiveness [15, 23] . Moreover, repeated infection of ferrets with H3N2 viruses affects both the quantity and quality of their antibody responses [25] . Thus, there appear to be two sides to the host response following repeated influenza virus infections and vaccination. Moreover, these observations leave open the larger question of whether antigenic interaction among influenza viruses is the only determinant of how an individual will respond to influenza virus infection.",

From Ref. [26] with permission difference, Suber and Kobzik castrated male and female mice on day P21 and infected them on day P28 [26] . Over the next 3 weeks, mortality was reduced in castrated but not in sham-operated mice. They then blocked the onset of puberty in P28-infected female mice by pretreating them (starting on day P21) with leuprolide, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog. Leuprolide desensitizes GnRH receptors and decreases the secretion of gonadotropins, and this blocks the normal pubertal increase in estrogen. They also pretreated male and female P28infected mice with acyline, a GnRH antagonist. Both leuprolide and acyline pretreatment improved survival [26] . In addition, when P21-ovariectomized mice were infected on day P28, estrogen treatment given 0-2 or 6-8 days following infection abrogated the protective effect of ovariectomy. Protection was also reversed in castrated males by treatment with both estrogen and testosterone (normally, testosterone is converted to estrogen by aromatase).",

The conditions for these experiments differed slightly from those in the influenza experiments [26] ; all mice were female and postpubertal mice were given LPS on postnatal days 33-35, not earlier. Prepubertal mice injected intraperitoneally with LPS on day P24-26 had significantly better survival than postpubertal mice 20 h after injection (Fig.  3a) , although endotoxin levels in the blood were similar in both groups (Fig. 3b) [28] . As in the influenza experiments, survival in prepubertal mice improved when the onset of puberty was delayed by pretreatment with estrogen (3 days before and on the day of LPS injection). Similarly, in postpubertal mice injected with LPS, blocking the onset of puberty by pretreatment with leuprolide (administered daily from prepubertal day P24 to postpubertal day P35) substantially improved survival. In addition, fulvestrant was administered to pre-and postpubertal mice to determine whether the increase in LPS-induced mortality was specifically due to the onset of puberty or the lack of estrogen activity, but the results were indeterminate. Finally, in LPS-treated postpubertal mice, adoptive transfer of peritoneal cells (macrophages and B and T cells) harvested from LPS-naive pre-and postpubertal mice had different effects on survival: mice that received cells from prepubertal mice had significantly lower mortality than those treated with postpubertal cells (Fig. 3c) [28] .",

Nonetheless, murine studies before and after puberty can be of considerable value. For example, estrogens have an mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (Salmonella enterica) and followed for 5 days. Mortality in mice injected with prepubertal peritoneal cells was significantly lower than it was in control mice or those that received postpubertal peritoneal cells. From Ref.

Kobzik et al. have shown that unlike other studies, estrogen treatment reversed protection against influenza mortality in prepubertal and castrated mice [26] . These apparently contradictory findings might reflect the known pro-inflammatory activities of low-dose estrogens and their anti-inflammatory effects when higher doses are used [26, 27] .",

Long-lasting, age-specific antigenic imprinting seen with influenza is not known to occur with most other forms of acute critical illness [6, 10] .

According to life history theory, the transition to puberty is accompanied by an overall switch in the allocation of energy from growth to reproduction.

(A similar study was undertaken with H1N1 challenge infection [57] .) Following infection, peripheral blood cytokine responses were determined every six hours for the next five days. In nine subjects who developed symptomatic illness, there were early increases in cytokines associated with fever, leucocyte recruitment and markers of innate antiviral immunity, and some of these increases appeared as early as two days before the onset of symptoms [56] . These cytokine findings were also demonstrated in a parallel genomic analysis. In contrast, the 17 subjects who remained asymptomatic showed early and persistent down regulation of the same inflammatory markers. Symptomatic subjects developed cytokine profiles similar to those that have been seen in patients who develop severe illness, while those who remained asymptomatic showed host responses indicating rapid control of infection. These findings suggested that the \"inflammatory pathway an individual will follow is probably determined at (a) very early, even presymptomatic time\" [56] . Which pathway is followed is probably determined (at least in part) by epigenetic factors [58] [59] [60] .",

One such study documented the responses of weanling and adult ferrets following infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus [65] . Compared with adult ferrets, weanlings developed much milder clinical illnesses and had less evidence of pulmonary damage, yet rapid virus clearance from the respiratory tract was seen in both groups. Like adults, the immune responses of weanlings to infection were robust, but they were different. Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in the two groups were similar, but regulatory response genes for IL-10 and TGF-1 were more highly expressed in weanlings [65] . Because influenza in ferrets closely mimics the disease in humans, this study suggests that the milder response to influenza in children compared with adults is due to a more strongly expressed regulatory response.",

Nonetheless, in 2004, surgeons reported two studies that directly compared the inflammatory responses of peritoneal macrophages harvested from the sterile abdomens of children and adults [67, 68] . Pro-and anti-inflammatory responses were elicited by exposing the macrophages ex vivo to endotoxin and IL-1. Unlike adults, responses in children were dominated by an IL-10 anti-inflammatory pattern. Recent research has shown that DNA methylation stably reduces the expression of IL-10 in Th1 cells [69] .

            "text": "A decade ago, surgeons who were involved in liver transplantation in children and adults sought to better understand inflammatory responses in their patients by studying hepatic ischemicreperfusion injury in mice of different ages [70] . They found evidence of less inflammation but greater autophagy in the livers of younger (4-5-week old) mice compared with older (10-12-week old) mice, and the response of younger mice was associated with greater nuclear retention of PPARg activity. Following pretreatment (for three days) of older mice with the PPARg agonist rosiglitazone, their highly inflammatory response was changed to the less inflammatory response seen in younger mice, and this change was associated with the autophagy pattern seen in younger mice. It is important to recognize that in this study younger mice were not clearly shown to be pre-pubertal and treatment was given before, not after the ischemic episode. Nonetheless, pre-treatment with rosiglitazone was able to \"roll back\" the damaging response of \"adults\" to the more benign response of \"children\". PPARg agonists have important effects on energy metabolism, and there is considerable \"crosstalk\" among these agents (glitazones) and other drugs that also have immunometabolic activities (e.g., statins [71] , ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [72] , metformin [73] ) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . These findings suggest that many if not all of these drugs could be used to change the host response of adults to that seen in children. The drugs would probably work better if given in combination rather than by themselves [8] . For a severe infection like pandemic influenza, treatment with these drugs could improve an adult's tolerance of infection [44] [45] [46] [47] and might improve survival. The drugs might also have similar effects in children who develop life-threatening illness.",

This estimate (51 to 81 million deaths) seems low because in 1918 pandemic mortality is thought to have been 50-100 million and today the global population is four times larger. A recent study from the Institute for Disease Modeling estimates that during the first six months of a 1918-like pandemic, almost 33 million people could die [75] . Moreover, if the next pandemic is caused by an H5N1-like virus, which has a high case fatality rate, its impact on global mortality could be much worse [3] [4] [5] [6] . Influenza virologists are now concerned about the possibility of an H7N9 pandemic [9, 76] . Nonetheless, even in the absence of pandemics, yearly outbreaks of seasonal influenza cause appreciable mortality worldwide [77] . Most of these influenza-related deaths (pandemic and seasonal) occur in developing countries [74, 77] .",

Influenza virologists hope to develop universal influenza vaccines that will provide long-lasting protection, making it unnecessary to vaccinate against seasonal influenza each year [78] . Vaccination with a universal vaccine might conceivably provide protection against infection with a future pandemic virus. Recent virologic studies, however, raise important questions about whether this strategy will work [79, 80] . Moreover, much of the world will lack the human infrastructure to guarantee administration of a universal vaccine [9] . This means that for the foreseeable future, health officials responsible for pandemic preparedness will have to count on using conventional pandemic vaccines. Unfortunately, none of these vaccines will be available during the first six pandemic months [9] . Moreover, when they eventually become available, it is unlikely they will be equitably distributed to low-and middle-income countries that don't produce their own influenza vaccines [81] . Antiviral treatment of individual pandemic patients could also be problematic. Supplies of one of the drugs (oseltamivir) are limited and the drug is not widely used. There is also concern about the development of antiviral resistance. Moreover, a recent report on 1220 patients hospitalized in China with laboratoryconfirmed H7N9 influenza showed that although 70% of all patients were treated with oseltamivir, case fatality rates were still 40% [82] .",

These drugs might have some effect on the development of symptomatic illness [83] , but their potential impact on pandemic mortality would be far more important. Agendas for laboratory and clinical research to evaluate their potential have been published in several articles ( Table 6 in reference 8, Table 1 in reference 9, and more generally in references 2 and 4-6). Although influenza scientists often regard host response treatment as an adjunct to antivirals [84] , some of this research must be limited to generic drugs that target the host response because most of the world's people won't have access to antivirals but will have access to generics. These studies must go beyond documenting cytokine responses following infection and examine immunometabolic and epigenetic factors that affect (among other things) cellular immunity, endothelial function and energy metabolism [8, 9] . All of these studies should include comparisons before and after puberty.",
