Although the technique has subsequently been employed for the study of herpetic infections by GRIrFr~ (3), KAVFMA~ (4) , and PnTTIT (6), a detailed report of the preparation and standardization of the conjugate has not been published. Laboratory manuals (5) describe fluorescent antibody techniques in general terms, however a single standardized method is not universally applicable and modifications are necessary for each agent studied. In view of the experimental and clinical usefulness of immunofluorescence a detailed outline of a method developed for the fluoresccin-isothiocyanate conjugation of herpesw;rus hominis type 1 antibody is reported.",

When thawed each aliquot must be tested with appropriate controls to ensure accuracy and stability. High animal antiserum titers are essential and each animal should be tested individually before pooling sera. Certain lots of commercial antisera were not satisfactory due to low antibody titers when tested. The sensitivity of the direct immunofluorescent method was comparable to the indirect method only when high titer antiserum was used to prepare the conjugate.
