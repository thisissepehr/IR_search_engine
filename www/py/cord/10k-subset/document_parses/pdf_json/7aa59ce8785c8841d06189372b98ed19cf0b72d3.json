An intact immune system offers protection against most microbial aggressors through a complex interrelationship of protecting surfaces, cells, and soluble factors. White blood cells (granulocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes), platelets, soluble factors of the immunoglobulins, complement, lymphokines, and other cytokines, as well as the physical barriers, have to be considered as integral and virtually indispensable components of a unitary defense system (Fig. 1 ). It has also become clear that the interplay between the body surfaces of the alimentary tract, particularly the gut, and its resident commensal microflora presents not a silent landscape but rather a theater in which there is constant movement and chatter between the host cells and a myriad of microbial species.

In physical terms, the only difference between the skin and the other parts of the integument is that it is dry, whereas the others are bathed in mucins and therefore continually moist. Thus, while both surfaces are normally colonized with a variety of microorganisms, including many different genera of bacteria and yeasts, the range and number of species and the biomass associated with mucosal surfaces are much greater than those of the skin. However, the resident microbial flora of each surface play an integral role in helping to maintain the function and integrity of these first lines of defense.

The cells are composed of keratin and resemble loose paving stones. They are joined together by desmosomes and are continually sloughed off during desquamation so that adherent bacteria are also lost. This rapid cell turnover occurs every 2 weeks and helps to limit opportunities for transient organisms to establish residence. A number of additional biologic factors contributes to the skin as an effective microbial barrier. Production of sebum establishes an oily, parched environment that is particularly hostile to the establishment of gram-negative bacteria, which are vulnerable to desiccation and require an aqueous environment for survival. Moreover, in this lipid-rich environment, only those microorganisms that elaborate lipases are capable of acquiring carbon from these lipids. The skin is also an effective barrier because it forms an acid mantle, having a pH of 5.0-6.0, and its surface temperature is, on average, about 5\u00b0C lower than that of the core body temperature. Thus, the range of organisms that are able to reside on the skin is strictly limited to a few, mainly gram-positive bacteria, such as various members of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium jeikeium, and other coryneforms, Propionibacterium spp., and certain yeasts ( Table 1 ) that can withstand these hostile conditions and compete successfully for binding sites and nutrients to establish a permanent and intimate attachment to the epidermis [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1660, "end": 1664, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1483, "end": 1490, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Skin"}, {"text": "Many of the resident bacteria also elaborate toxins that inhibit closely related microorganisms, allowing individual species to retain their foothold and consolidate their territory.

Chemotherapy and irradiation can bring about radical changes in the normal skin by interrupting normal cell replacement, resulting in hair loss, dryness, and loss of sweat production. The latter may also lead to lower levels of the antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, which is secreted in normal sweat and is an effector of innate immunity [17] . In addition, steroids also can exert a profound effect on sebum secretions. When the skin is broken, the release of fibronectin is thought to assist colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, and other changes facilitate colonization with gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterobacteriaceae. Cutaneous infection results from the loss of integrity and reduced local immunity of the skin as well as disturbances within the resident flora. Abraded skin and the associated exudates and minor breaches in the integument can lead to local infection as well as provide a reservoir that assists further spread to other body surfaces, including the oral cavity.

Acidity plays a crucial role both in disinfecting the stomach and in regulating the microbial milieu of the vagina. The upper respiratory, alimentary, and genitourinary tracts are essentially composed of epithelial cells interspersed by cells that produce mucins. These hydrophilic substances perform various functions, including lubrication, waterproofing, and preventing sudden changes in osmotic pressure [18] . They also contain inhibitory substances, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, defensins, and peroxidase, as well as secretory IgA.

Current knowledge, however, challenges this dichotomy because the innate and adaptive immune systems have considerable overlap and are highly interlinked. For instance, the composition of the ''cytokine cocktail'' released after stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) directs the adaptive immune response toward T-helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, or regulatory T-cell activity [1] . In other words, the innate immune system orchestrates the adaptive immune system [53, 54] . Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity, the dichotomy has been maintained so far. The innate immune system is a primary highly conserved immune system that can been found in most living organisms, from plants to insects to mammals [55] . This is essentially all there is to the immune system of plants and insects unlike more evolved creatures such as mammals that also possess an adaptive immune response. Being the first point of contact with microorganisms and foreign molecules, the innate immune system mobilizes a primary response to external threats. This is characterized by being rapid, crude, lacking in specificity and without any development of ''memory'' so that when re-challenged the same response ensues. By contrast, the adaptive immune system is highly specific in recognizing foreign molecules and reacts with increased magnitude with every re-challenge. The innate immune system consists of a variety of humoral and cellular components [55] as well as the epithelial cell network that creates a direct physical barrier. Humoral factors consist of the complement systems (classical, alternative, and lectin pathway), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein), and mucosal secretions (mucins and saliva).

Approximately 90 % of the total population of neutrophils resides in the bone marrow, only to be released into the circulation upon an inflammatory stimulus. Neutrophils that enter the bloodstream are distributed over two compartments of equal size in dynamic equilibrium: a free circulating pool of neutrophils and the marginating pool, consisting of neutrophils that adhere loosely to the vascular endothelium. The size of these respective pools is under the influence of several factors. Adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells is mediated by a number of adhesion molecules on neutrophils, which are induced by factors such as complement factor C5a, which acts as a ligand. Likewise, there is a whole series of adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells themselves, with cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-a being important inducers of these molecules [72] . Other inflammatory impulses and glucocorticosteroids are also potent inhibitors of margination. Circulating neutrophils disappear after approximately 6 h in blood, whereas they survive 1-3 days in tissues. During an acute inflammatory reaction, an increase in neutrophils, sometimes accompanied by eosinophils and followed by macrophages, can be seen at the site of inflammation. The formation of this inflammatory exudate is the result of activation of several humoral factors, such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and complement, which enhance the blood flow and increase vascular permeability. This occurs in conjunction with chemotactic activity, which results from other soluble factors, especially C5a, leukotriene B, interleukin-8, and bacterial products.

However, the mere presence of granulocytes at the site of an infection is meaningless if they are not able to execute their normal functions.

Although contradictory results and lack of consistency do not permit firm conclusions, these polymorphisms have provided an insight into the pathogenesis of complex immunologic processes that occur following intensive anti-cancer treatment. Future studies are designed to address the applicability of this information in the prevention or treatment of infections and other complications in patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing HSCT. Modulating the innate immune system with the use of selective agonists and antagonists of TLRs and other PRRs could be a future therapeutic strategy ameliorating complications in cancer therapy [115, 116] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 575, "end": 580, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 752, "end": 757, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 758, "end": 763, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 764, "end": 769, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 919, "end": 924, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 925, "end": 929, "text": "112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1175, "text": "[113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1180, "text": "114]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1824, "text": "[115,", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1829, "text": "116]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 566, "end": 574, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Dysfunctional Innate Immunity"}, {"text": "Most cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment of malignant diseases have a dosedependent deleterious effect on the proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, including those of the myeloid series. After destruction of the mitotic pool by one or more cytotoxic compounds and depletion of the marrow pool reserve, granulocytopenia lasting days or weeks will ensue, particularly in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and following HSCT-conditioning regimens. Likewise, therapeutic radiation may induce a clinically significant granulocytopenia, depending on dose rate, total dose, irradiated area, and field size. Total body irradiation, as used in HSCT procedures, is the most illustrative of the potential deleterious effects of irradiation. However, both chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation do not only inhibit the proliferating cell pool, they also interfere with nonproliferating cells and their function. In granulocytes, this may result in decreased chemotaxis, diminished phagocytotic capacity, and defective intracellular killing. Glucocorticosteroids seem to enhance granulocytopoiesis and mobilize the marginal as well as marrow pool reserve, but these supposedly positive effects on the granulocytes are counterbalanced by numerous disadvantages. Indeed, these drugs restrain the accumulation of neutrophils at the site of inflammation through impaired migration, probably due to reduced adherent capacity of the granulocytes, and diminished chemotactic activity. Furthermore, they negatively influence phagocytosis and intracellular killing by neutrophils in a dose-dependent fashion and are associated with a reduction in the number of eosinophils in the blood.

Although they usually occur simultaneously, any substantial reduction in the number of granulocytes or qualitative defect in the phagocytic process can, in fact, make the patient prone to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. It has been shown that an inverse correlation exists between the number of circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes, and the frequency of infection. Depending on the duration of neutropenia, the risk of a febrile episode varies between 30 and 80 %. In a study by Bodey et al.

When severe chemotherapy-induced mucositis extends to the cecum, typhlitis, or neutropenic enterocolitis can occur and the recovery of Clostridium septicum from the blood confirms the diagnosis [173] (Fig. 5) [174] . Gut permeability also increases following conditioning therapy for bone marrow transplant [175] . Agents used either for the treatment of neoplasms or supportive care may even exert an influence on gut and oral flora, either alone or in combination.

The antifungal, miconazole, is also inhibitory to gram-positive bacteria [182] . Gut motility is reduced during parenteral nutrition due to the low amounts of fiber and reduced microbial biomass, which result in dilute feces. When the gut fails to function normally, the protective ''anaerobic wallpaper'' may still be intact but will be unusually fragile to the effect of antimicrobial agents. Thus, unless placed in a degree of isolation and supplied with low-microbial content diets, patients will be vulnerable to acquiring other gram-negative bacilli from the environment [21] [22] [23] . Neutropenic enterocolitis (also known as typhlitis) is an example of the interplay between the nature of the chemotherapeutic regimen, the mucosal barrier injury it induces, the indigenous microbial flora that remains after exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, and the absence of neutrophils. Certain cytotoxic drugs e.g., cytarabine can disrupt the mucosal barrier of the gut as well as causing protracted neutropenia and hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia. Necrosis of the gastrointestinal mucosa particularly of the terminal ileum or cecum manifests as enterocolitis and predisposes the patient to infection with any organism capable of invasion. Antimicrobial treatment, first with selective antimicrobial prophylaxis e.g., with a fluoroquinolone and later with broad-spectrum antibiotics e.g., ceftazidime, will profoundly disturb the normal resident flora and may provide a selective advantage to a resistant bacterium such as Clostridium septicum.

What is required is a two-pronged approach involving more selective cancer treatment, to avoid damaging healthy tissue combined with strategies that prevent, or at least ameliorate, any unavoidable toxicity.
