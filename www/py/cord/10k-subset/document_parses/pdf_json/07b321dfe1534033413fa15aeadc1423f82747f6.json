We were particularly interested in the presence of HCoV-NL63 in respiratory disease for which no other viral pathogen could be detected, in order to identify clinical symptoms associated with HCoV-NL63 infection. Nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) of the patients had already been tested for RSV, INF, and PIV, the principal viruses responsible for LRTI in young children. 8 However, RNA of these viruses could not be detected in 58% of samples for outpatients and 51% of samples for hospitalized patients. A second study that examined a subset of these negative samples for human metapneumovirus RNA showed that this virus could be detected in only 0.3% of the patients. 9 To explore the potential contribution of HCoV-NL63 to LRTI and to define clinical symptoms associated with HCoV-NL63 infection, a subset of the PRI.DE samples were analyzed in this study by a HCoV-NL63-specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 158, "end": 160, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 161, "end": 162, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 475, "end": 477, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 478, "end": 479, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1098, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1397, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Of the 949 PRI.DE samples tested, 392 were from outpatients at the four study sites, and the remaining 557 samples were from hospitalized patients.

PIV3 follows the same pattern (8% and 5%, respectively), but the reverse pattern is observed for RSV (21% and 32%, respectively). 8 Thus, HCoV-NL63 infection seems to be less pathogenic than RSV infection. Hospitalized HCoV-NL63positive patients are frequently co-infected with RSV. Nevertheless, several severe disease cases that required uptake in the intensive care unit were linked exclusively to HCoV-NL63 infection in this and our previous survey. 1 Croup is a common manifestation of LRTI in children. The cause is generally assumed to be a respiratory virus and PIV1 has frequently been implicated. 10 Among the 69 samples of patients analyzed with croup, croup was indeed frequently linked to PIV1 (14.5%), but PIV3 (15.9%), RSV-A (13.0%), PIV2 (7.2%), and RSV-B (1.4%) were also ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 740, "end": 741, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1065, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1219, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "HCoV-NL63 + PIV3, RSV-A, or RSV-B detected in a considerable percentage of samples. HCoV-NL63 could be detected in 17.4% of these croup patients and was therefore the most frequently identified respiratory virus for croup. Since most of the samples tested were derived from the year 2000-2001, we cannot exclude that the high percentage of HCoV-NL63-positive samples is due to a strong viral activity in this particular year, and long-term studies are needed to determine whether HCoV-NL63 infections occur in cycles peaking every two to three years as observed for other respiratory viruses. Croup has been reported to occur mostly in boys, and it shows a peak occurrence in the second year of life and predominantly in the late fall or early winter season. 10 HCoV-NL63 infection seems to follow these trends: the ratio of boys infected to girls infected is 10:4, the median age in the outpatient group with HCoV-NL63 is 1.55 years, and this virus is circulating mainly in the winter months. Thus, it will be of interest to study the underlying biological reasons for the increased susceptibility of young boys to HCoV-NL63, as this may also explain the higher number of male patients with croup.

This interference effect might be explained by direct competition for the same target cell in the respiratory organs or an elevated activation status of innate immune responses. Prolonged persistence of HCoV-NL63 at low levels is another explanation. The HCoV-NL63 load was found to vary with respect to the time of sampling relative to the time of disease onset, with the higher viral loads in early samples (day 1 or 2 after disease onset). This most likely reflects viral clearance by the immune system. This timing effect may also relate to the differences in HCoV-NL63 load in single versus double infections. For instance, an initial HCoV-NL63 infection may set the stage for a subsequent RSV infection. At the time that this second virus is causing symptoms and NPS samples are collected, the HCoV-NL63 infection may already be under control by the immune system.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HCoV-NL63"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study revealed that HCoV-NL63 belongs to the group of most frequently detected viruses in children under 3 year of age with LRTI and that this virus is strongly associated with croup.
