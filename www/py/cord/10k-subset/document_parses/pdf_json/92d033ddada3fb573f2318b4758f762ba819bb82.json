It is now recognized that fibrosis is a dynamic process, and may be reversible prior to the establishment of advanced architectural changes to the liver. The most effective antifibrotic strategy is to cure the underlying disease process before advanced fibrosis has developed. Unfortunately, this is often not possible, and specific antifibrotic therapies are needed. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis have identified several potential novel therapeutic targets, but unfortunately clinical development has been disappointing. One major limitation has been the often prolonged natural history of fibrosis compared to experimental models, and difficulties in accurate noninvasive fibrosis assessment, thus making clinical trial design difficult. In this review, we highlight the most promising current antifibrotic strategies.",

Progress in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis has made it increasingly possible to target key molecules or pathways involved in fibrogenesis. It is hoped that this approach will lead to therapeutic breakthroughs in the near future.

Initiating signals include oxidative stress signals [2] , apoptotic bodies [3] , TLR4 ligands (lipopolysaccharide) [4\u2022 ] and paracrine stimuli from neighboring Kupffer cells, sinusoidal epithelial cells and hepatocytes, driven by the ongoing liver insult. Subsequent autocrine and paracrine perpetuating signals maintain and transdifferentiate the activated HSC into a contractile myofibroblast. This process involves the increased secretion of soluble mediators and their receptors, including cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Key mediators include transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) [5, 6] , platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [7] , angiotensin II [8, 9] , leptin [10] , and signaling via the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) [11] . Recently, expression of \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin on activated cholangiocytes has been recognized to promote activation of latent TGF-\u03b21 and be a potent fibrogenic stimulus in models of cholestatic liver disease [12] . As a result, the myofibroblast remains in a state of enhanced proliferation, contractility, chemotaxis, and fibrogenesis. Fibrogenesis has two key features. The excess secretion and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, including type I and III collagen (vs type IV), is compounded by an imbalance between increased myofibroblast secretion of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (primarily TIMP-1/2) and decreased production of the fibrinolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2/3/9/1) [2] .",

Although a negative study, a trend towards reduction in fibrosis stage was noted in the IFN-\u03b3 arm [32] . A subsequent pilot study focused specifically on the antifibrotic effect of IFN-\u03b3 in patients with CHC infection. Although there was no overall reduction in fibrosis stage, six patients (30%) had more than 1% absolute reduction in morphometric fibrosis score, and four patients (20%) displayed improvement in Ishak fibrosis score [33] . Another small study suggested antifibrotic benefit for IFN-\u03b3 in the setting of chronic hepatitis B infection [34] . These data led to the performance of a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial investigating the antifibrotic efficacy of 48 weeks of therapy with IFN-\u03b3 [35\u2022] . In this trial, 502 patients with CHC were randomly assigned to IFN-\u03b3 100 \u03bcg, IFN-\u03b3 200 \u03bcg, or placebo, 3 times weekly. Pre-and post-treatment biopsies were available from 420 patients. Unfortunately no improvement in Ishak score was observed between the 3 treatment groups (12.1% vs 12.4% vs 16% of patients with reduction \u22651 stage on the Ishak fibrosis score, P-value> 0.05). It is important to note that most patients enrolled in this study (84%) were cirrhotic at baseline, representing a difficult-to-treat group. Subgroup analysis suggested that patients with \u226560% induction of serum interferon-inducible T cell-\u03b1 (ITAC) by 24 weeks' therapy had a significantly better liver histology outcome, possibly identifying an IFN-\u03b3 responsive population.

Therefore, use of angiotensin II antagonists potentially offers dual clinical benefit. The key effector is downstream angiotensin II. Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonists (AIIRA) inhibit liver fibrosis in small-animal models. In addition, they are already widely used for cardiovascular and renal indications, where antifibrotic effects have been observed, and safety data are well-established, thus making them attractive candidates. A recently published pilot study evaluated the antifibrotic benefits of the AIIRA losartan in hepatitis C virus (HCV)related hepatic fibrosis [41] . Fourteen patients were treated with losartan for 18 months and had paired liver biopsy assessment. Losartan therapy was associated with decreased hepatic expression of profibrogenic genes (including procollagen \u03b11(I) and \u03b11(IV), urokinase-type plasminogen activator, metalloproteinase type-2), as well as NADPH oxidase components, a key mediator of angiotensin IIinduced oxidative stress. METAVIR fibrosis stage was observed to decrease in seven patients, although no significant change occurred in fibrosis overall. Phase 2/3 clinical trials investigating candesartan and irbesartan as antifibrotic agents in the setting of HCV infection are in progress (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00930995 and NCT00265642, respectively); Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-[1-7]) is a peptide product of the recently described ACE homologue, ACE2, and signals via the mas receptor.

At the cellular level, the caspase family of cysteine proteases is the key inducer and effector of apoptotic cell death, and has an important role in HCV-related liver injury. Caspase inhibitors have entered early-phase human trials for the amelioration of inflammation and prevention of fibrosis in the setting of chronic hepatitis C. The first agent to enter human studies was IDN-6556 (PF-03491390). For this agent, 105 patients were enrolled in a phase 2, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of 14 days' duration [42] . In this study, 80 patients had CHC, and 25 had other chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis B (CHB), NASH, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In patients with CHC, significant reductions of serum aminotransaminases were observed at all except the lowest dose. Similar responses were observed in patients with CHB and NASH. No antiviral effect was noted and adverse events were similar to placebo. Hepatic fibrosis was not an appropriate endpoint for this 14-day study. Longer studies were planned, but development has since been halted. GS-9450 is a second caspase inhibitor currently in a phase 2 program. The primary endpoint is hepatic inflammation, but morphometric quantitation of hepatic collagen staining will be examined as a secondary endpoint (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00874796). A third caspase inhibitor, VX-166, was shown to reduce hepatic fibrosis in an animal model of NASH [43] . One important concern with the use of caspase inhibitors is the risk of potentiating hepatocarcinogenesis, particularly if long-term therapy is required in patients with advanced fibrosis, itself a premalignant state.",

It is particularly difficult to capture the complex interactions that occur between multiple cell populations in a cell culture model. Fibrogenic pathways in small animal models may not be relevant to human physiology. Beyond preclinical studies, clinical development also has significant challenges, not the least the indolent nature and often prolonged natural history of fibrosis progression, and perhaps regression. Several years of antifibrotic therapy may be required to determine clinical or histologic benefit, and these endpoints are difficult to capture within the time and economic constraints of most clinical trials. Further, accurate repeated measures of liver fibrosis besides liver biopsy are required.

Although several emerging potential therapeutic targets exist, antifibrotic drug development is challenging, and significant hurdles need to be overcome at the preclinical and clinical stages. In the meantime, greater emphasis must be placed on the early identification of patients with potentially treatable chronic liver disease.",
