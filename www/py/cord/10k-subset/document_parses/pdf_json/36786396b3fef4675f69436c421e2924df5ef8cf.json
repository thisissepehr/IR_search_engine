Especially, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are ubiquitously detected in surface water and soil, mainly in the aquatic compartment, where they do affect the living systems. Unfortunately, there is a huge gap in the availability of ecotoxicological data on pharmaceuticals' environmental behavior and ecotoxicity which force EMEA (European Medicines Agency) to release guidelines for their risk assessment. In silico modeling approaches are vital tools to exploit the existing information to rapidly emphasize the potentially most hazardous and toxic pharmaceuticals and prioritize the most environmentally hazardous ones for focusing further on their experimental studies. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are capable of predicting missing properties for toxic end-points required to prioritize existing, or newly synthesized chemicals for their potential hazard. This chapter reviews the information regarding occurrence and impact of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the environment along with their persistence, environmental fate, risk assessment, and risk management. A bird's eye view about the necessity of in silico methods for fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment as well as existing successful models regarding ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are discussed. Available toxicity endpoints, ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems frequently used for ecotoxicity predictions of pharmaceuticals are also reported. The overall discussion justifies the requirement to build up additional in silico models for quick prediction of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals economically, without or involving only limited animal testing.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Pharmaceuticals are one of the indispensable products with unquestionable benefits to human health and lifestyle. Regrettably, due to overuse of pharmaceuticals together with their improper disposal, unwanted residues of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been found in different compartments of environment since 1970 [1, 2] . Pharmaceuticals are deliberately designed to have an explicit mechanism of action (MOA) and exercise an effect on specific organs, tissues, or cells in living systems and many of them are persistent in the body [3] . Thus, pharmaceuticals and their unaltered metabolites can affect humans as well as animals when entered into the environment by diverse sources and routes. Also the MOA designed for human could be different for another type of species and even potentially \"safe\" drugs could have serious effects on them from biological ladder. This feature makes pharmaceuticals unique from other chemicals and this is the one and only reason to assess the potential acute and chronic effects of pharmaceuticals in diverse environmental compartments. It is quite obvious that the toxicity of pharmaceuticals on organisms in aquatic and nonaquatic environment is due to their long persistent and bioaccumulative nature [4] . One of the notable effects is the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to numerous antibiotics due to the overuse of pharmaceuticals in humans and pet animals [5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 333, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 334, "end": 336, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 550, "end": 553, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1261, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1439, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The ridiculously excess use of pharmaceutical products was well reported [5, 6] showing significant negative consequences for environment and individual health system in the last decades [6, 7] .

According to the US FDA guidelines, applicants have to present an environmental assessment report when the probable concentration of the API in the aquatic environment is \u22651 \u03bcg/L [27] . Previously, the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) issued a guidance document 'Guidance for Industry for the Submission of an Environmental Assessment in Human drug Application and Supplements' in 1995 [28] . Due to the emerging concern of their hazards, directive 2004/27/EC [29, 30] for human medicine and directive 2004/28/EC [31] for veterinary medicine required an Environmental Risk Assessment for marketing authorization of new pharmaceuticals products. The European Union Directive 2013/39/EU [32] included two pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and 17-alpha-ethynilestradiol (EE2)) and a natural hormone (17-betaestradiol (E2)) in a first watch list of ten substances for the European Union monitoring of water.

Regrettably, the number of available experimental data is very limited. The available data are also limited to specific species and assessed for particular environment compartment. In absence of sufficient experimental data, quantitative structureactivity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) approach represents a convincing substitute to predict the possible hazards, from their chemical structure information [35] . Thus, to fill the data gaps, government and nongovernment regulatory authorities suggest the use of in silico methods for prediction of the physicochemical properties, toxicological activity, distribution, fate, etc. of pharmaceuticals along with their effects on environment and living systems much before they enter into market for usage. Therefore, usage of QSAR as one of the nonexperimental methods is noteworthy in order to lessen time, animal usage and cost involvement in toxicity prediction of pharmaceuticals [36, 37] . Persistent and Bioaccumulative (PB) behavior of pharmaceuticals was studied by Howard and Muir [38] employing QSAR models. More than 1200 pharmaceuticals were screened and prioritized for overall Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) potential using the Insubria PBT Index and the US-EPA PBT Profiler by Sangion and Gramatica [39] . The European Union Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and Environment (CSTEE) had recommended the use of QSAR models for screening purposes of pharmaceutical ingredients [40] .

Thus, once they are released into the environment in an altered form or in their real form, they affect the living organism of diverse compartments of environment which is the sufficient reason to monitor and assess the potential effects of pharmaceuticals to environment. Assessment of occurrence level of pharmaceuticals in diverse compartments is necessary as the observed amount highly varies from one compartment to another which makes the situation complex for environmentalists. On the other hand, most of the interactions between pharmaceuticals and natural stressors of aquatic and terrestrial communities are unexplained till date. Thus to evaluate the risk of waste hazards pose to wildlife, it has been recommended to utilize the toxicity data derived from mammals during the production stages of pharmaceuticals which may be helpful for future prediction. To quantify the ecotoxic concentration threshold of any pharmaceutical, calculation of the risk quotient (RQ) is very important. The RQ expresses the ratio between the predicted concentration in the environment (PEC) and the concentration at which no effect is expected (PNEC) [21] . The present chapter reviews the most common routes, sources and occurrence of pharmaceutical hazards along with their fate and effects in different environments. Apart from studies on individual pharmaceuticals, the need of risk assessment and management of their metabolites and mixture of pharmaceuticals are discussed. The role of government authorities and different policies regulated regarding identification of risk assessment and management must be implemented in a proper way with right direction. Conversely, insufficient ecotoxicity data related to a definite class of pharmaceuticals has slowed down the computational modeling to some point. So, properly documented database is the need of the hour for environmentalists. On the contrary, though a good number of in silico models, especially QSAR models are reported for toxicity prediction of chemicals hazards, but a few successful models exist for pharmaceutical hazards. Thus, ample number of models should be generated to get the ecotoxicity data for pharmaceuticals for diverse endpoints and environmental compartments. Expert systems have the ability to make fast and reliable predictions with a single click of mouse, which urges to develop more expert systems for a set of endpoints. There is no doubt that in silico methods cannot completely substitute experimental approaches, but they can be integrated for better understanding and quantification of pharmaceuticals' ecotoxicity.
