However, Kjolby et al.'s [28\u2022] findings in the Sort1\u2212/ \u2212 mouse call into question the therapeutic strategy for Sort1 targeting, and suggest that it is Sort1 inhibition that will reduce plasma cholesterol and ASCVD risk. All research published to date support an unequivocal role for Sort1 in lipid metabolism and ASCVD and suggest that the power of the 1p13 locus can be harnessed to dramatically affect plasma cholesterol and ASCVD risk in humans.
