Nevertheless, the vicious circle malnutrition-infection and the synergistic interaction between them must be kept in mind always when one deals with these infants. We have deliberately chosen infants with potentially or currently severe parenteral infections because of their high risk of death. Twenty of our infants were admitted with only diarrhoea, or diarrhoea and mild upper respiratory infection, and nine of them developed bronchopneumonia, sepsis and/or meningitis during hospitalization, one of which died. This clearly shows that all our infants must be considered a high risk.",

B cell activation is dependent on T helper cells which promote antibody secretion, whereas T suppressor cells inhibit it. In fact, it has been shown that malnourished children present an altered relation of T helper: T cytotoxic/suppressor cells (helper cells being decreased to a greater extent than suppressor cells) and a decreased ability of T helper cells to provide help to B cells in antibody synthesis. 30 The wards in developing countries are often overcrowded with malnourished diarrhoeic infants and it is certainly not necessary to submit them all to the same critical care therapy. However, because of the high mortality rates in this setting it would be particularly useful to have at hand predictive prognostic indices which allow a rational selection of patients with a high risk of death. Besides, alternative or additional measures'\u2022 31 -32 should be sought for these infants. Increased risk of death in children has been associated with higher degrees of malnutrition, 33 but prognostic indices including immunological parameters have, to our knowledge, been published only for mainly surgical adult patients. 1334 \" 36 Heyworth et al. 1975, 37 although not applying a prognostic index, described that the inhibition of in vitro PHAinduced lymphocyte transformation was maximal when using plasma from malnourished children who subsequently died.

It is not expensive, it is easy to carry out and can be read in 24 hours thereby enabling quick decisions.
