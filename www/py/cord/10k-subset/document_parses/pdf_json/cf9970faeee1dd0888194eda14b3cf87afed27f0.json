Using cloned Eco Rl fragments of the HSV-1 genome 91 as radioactive probes in cell and dot-blot analysis, 60% of the HSV-1 genome (Eco Rl fragments D, G, N, F, M, O, A and I) was present in all cell types at 2h PI.

In contrast, the viral DNA content in ResM4> decreased to undetectable levels by 48h PI. Eco Rl fragments H, L, EK, and JK representing the terminal repeats, joint region and part of unique long region are reported to contain sequences that cross-hybridize with cellular sequences (Sandri-Goldin personal communication). 9293 The examination of this region of the HSV-1 genome in infected MrJ> by the more detailed Southern blot analysis 94 showed results similar to those for the other parts of the HSV genome.
