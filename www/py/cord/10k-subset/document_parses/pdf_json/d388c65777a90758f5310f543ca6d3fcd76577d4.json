The primary outcome of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and contribution in diagnosis and/or modification of the ongoing treatment of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) in patients with ARDS treated with NIV. Methods: ARDS patients treated with NIV and who require FOB as the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure were included the study. Intensive care ventilators or other dedicated NIV ventilators were used. NIV was applied via simple oro-nasal mask or full-face mask. Pressure support or inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), external positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) levels were titrated to achieve an expiratory tidal volume of 8 to 10 ml/kg according to ideal body weight, SpO 2 > 90 % and respiratory rate below 25/min.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be performed safely without major complications in this group of patients. Diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy is necessary for some ICU patients treated for acute respiratory failure, however it can be associated with various complications as well as mortality. Because of these risks, FOB can be challenging in these patients. Bronchoscope covers 10-15 % of the tracheal lumen and may increase respiration efforts and decrease PaO 2 by 10-20 mmHg causing respiratory and cardiac complications [18] . Additionally, BAL sampling may cause worsening of oxygen desaturation [19] . The American Thoracic Society recommends avoiding FOB and BAL in patients with hypoxemia (PaO 2 < 75 mmHg or oxygen saturation <90 % with supplemental oxygen) [20] . Although alternative approaches in these patients with higher-risk are empirical treatments or intubation for FOB, the observational study and the randomized controlled trials have shown that NIV may be an alternative to endotracheal intubation in these critically ill patients who are not previously ventilated [10, 11, 21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 882, "end": 886, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1129, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1452, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1456, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Early etiological diagnosis in critically ill patients is important for appropriate treatment.

Underlying diseases of these patients were interstitial lung disease and lung involvement due to connective tissue disease. The patients were receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy before admission to hospital and FOB was applied to diagnose opportunistic infections. Three patients died within 24 h after the procedure. FOB should not be considered in these cases, because they had severe underlying diseases and infections when they were admitted. Identified mixt infectious agents had a major effect in their fast progression. Cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci in two patients, Acremonium and Cytomegalovirus in another patient were shown as opportunistic infectious agents. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy usually causes alteration in gas exchange. In hypoxemic intubated patients, PaO 2 returns to baseline within 2 h [26] . None of the patients in the current study needed intubation within 2 h after FOB. Based on this information, FOB may not have led to intubation in three patients. Baumann et al. [12] found that 40 patients required NIV prior to the decision to use FOB. Four of them ( shown as risk factors for intubation [22] . Intubation rate in the current study is acceptable according to presented rates in the literature. Intubation rate reached to 54 % in patients with acute respiratory failure who received NIV. Also, NIV failure ratio was 62 % in moderate and 84 % in severe ARDS [27] . Cases in the current study were not intubated due to sudden gas exchanges and hemodynamic deterioration after bronchoscopy. Severe underlying diseases and infection situations should be taken into consideration for IMV. The authors of this study aware of the discussions about using NIV in patients with ARDS. But a recent study which assessed intubation rate and risk factors of NIV failure in patients with non-hypercapnic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure showed significant differences for intubation rate among four groups (non-ARDS, mild ARDS, moderate ARDS, severe ARDS). However, the mortality rate was not statistically significant and the time to intubation had no effect on patient mortality [27] . In patients with hematologic malignancies and acute respiratory failure, delayed (after NIV failure) vs. immediate IMV was associated with increased hospital mortality which was not statistically significant (65 % vs. 58 %) [28] . Early diagnosis and beginning time of true treatment in patients with immunosuppression may be as important as ARDS severity.
