These patients also incurred an average additional cost of $9825/patient/day. Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are most at risk for the development of ES following ASCT. Up to 30% of these patients developed the complication and the high incidence has been attributed to the prior use of bortezomib and lenalidomide. 4 Sixty-six percent were men. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized using G-CSF (10 \u03bcg/kg/day) AE plerixafor PCT with a cutoff of <2 ng/mL might be an adjunctive biomarker in identifying patients suffering from non-infectious fever associated with ES following ASCT. A PCT guided algorithm may limit the duration of antibiotics, reduce adverse events and prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Large randomized controlled trials comparing PCT guided antimicrobial therapy vs. standard of care to limit unnecessary exposure to antimicrobials in immunocompromised ASCT recipients are warranted.",
