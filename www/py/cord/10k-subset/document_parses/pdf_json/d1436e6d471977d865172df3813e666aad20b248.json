These research efforts play an important part in deepening biological and chemical knowledge and build the scientific groundwork for designing new drugs and biologically active food additives. Some results of the study of natural compounds were discussed in a paper read at a session of the RAS Presidium and are published below.",

Stonik, G.A. Tolstikov, 2008 , published in Vestnik Rossiiskoi Akademii Nauk, 2008 Secondary metabolites are biological molecules without general distribution. In contrast to primary metabolites, they can only be found in certain taxa or even in one biological species. These substances are formed from predecessors that take part in primary metabolism, such as amino acids, monosaccharides, and others, and they mostly are the final products of their biochemical conversions. Secondary metabolites are known to be physiologically active, and some of them (morphine, quinine, cholesterol, and others) were among the first organic compounds to be isolated almost 200 years ago. It took the efforts of several generations of scientists to determine the chemical structures of such substances.",

By biological functions, they are generally classified as vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, toxins, pheromones, and many other groups. In the Russian and international literature, such compounds are often called natural products, although, of course, other types of biomolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, are equally natural. Nevertheless, here we will use the term natural products solely with respect to secondary metabolites: predominantly exogenous compounds that enter a human body together with food and drugs. However, natural products include both endo-and exometabolites, that is, substances with certain biological functions in producer organisms, for example, hormones, phytohormones, alexins, and substances that are excreted by these organisms into the environment and that are of great ecological importance, among them toxins, antibiotics, and various signal compounds. The main biological sources of natural products are supreme terrestrial plants, soil microorganisms, and various marine organisms. The total number of known natural products does not, probably, exceed 100 000-150 000, but many experts believe that it is considerably smaller [1] . For reference, by now, chemists have synthesized about 30 million organic compounds.",

The presence of vitamins, antioxidants, and other useful natural compounds makes nutrition adequate, and so-called biologically active food additives STONIK, TOLSTIKOV (BAFAs) are being used to try to compensate for a lack of them. They are used increasingly more in advanced countries. In the United States, for example, there are 30 000 registered BAFAs, and in Russia, 5000, including a host of foreign preparations. Fraudulent advertising often presents BAFAs as a \"cure-all,\" while they, as a rule, do not cure any serious diseases but generally are preventives and analeptics. In the United States, the portion of people who take BAFAs is more than 20%. We may expect that the use of bioadditives in Russia will grow too, the more so because in recent years progressively more valuable qualities have been discovered in natural foodstuffs. Three recent examples could be the clinical confirmation of antitumor properties of epigallocatechin-3-gallate from green tea; the explanation of the so-called \"French paradox\" (a relatively rare occurrence of cardiovascular diseases in French southerners who regularly drink red wine and eat fatty food) by the presence of resveratrol in red wine; and the discovery of red-pepper capsaicin's ability to destroy malignant cells.",

Thus, some marine invertebrates were found to contain minor but superactive secondary metabolites that have an extremely high toxicity for tumor cells: they exceed the majority of present-day antitumor drugs by hundreds and thousands of times. For example, spongistatin ( Fig. 1a ) from tropical marine sponges is the most active of all natural and synthetic compounds ever found in antitumor studies at the National Cancer Institute (United States). This substance was first discovered in the sponge owing to the biological activity of related extracts, but it took a long time to isolate it in quantities needed for structural investigation. Only after gathering and processing three tons of the sponge was it possible to obtain 0.8 mg of spongistatin. Then, a different type of sponge was used as a source material, and 400 kg of it, collected near the Maldives, yielded 10 mg of spongistatin. Following the validation of its structure, researchers began studying the physiological behavior of this macrolide. The inhibiting dose causing the death of 50% of tumor cells was 10 -10 M (for rectal cancer) and 10 -12 M (for breast cancer). In experiments on animals with lethal malignant tumors, the administration of spongistatin in a 25 \u00b5 g/kg dose resulted in 70% survival.",

Moreover, they discovered (sometimes, jointly with immunomodulators; hepatoprotectors; and other valuable natural products from marine and terrestrial biological sources. They also studied molecular action mechanisms, conducted full syntheses, and thoroughly examined the physiological activity of a whole series of the most interesting substances. Thus, the first representative of bipolar sphingolipid-like metabolites, rhizochalin ( Fig. 1b) from tropical sponges, showed antifungal activity, even against drug-resistant fungi that are agents of mycoses in AIDS patients. Alkaloids from polycarpine (Fig. 1c) and varacin (Fig. 1d ) sea squirts demonstrated high antitumor activities. In terms of tumor cell toxicity, the latter surpasses the wellknown doxorubicine and has a higher activity in an acidic medium, which is associated with some selectivity for tumors versus normal tissues. Indeed, it is generally known that many tumors acidify themselves due to increased glycolysis. Glycosides from commercial holothurians, for example, cucumarioside (Fig. 1e ), appeared to be strong enhancers of cellular immunity, and acidified steroids from starfish, including asterosaponin \u00ea 1 (Fig. 1f) , stimulators for neural tissue process (neurite) growth. The results of basic research carried out at the Pacific Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry have become the groundwork for applied developments, in particular, new drugs, bioactive food additives, diagnosticums, veterinary medications, and biochemical preparations. Thus, long-term observation of quinonoid pigments from urchins led to new medicinal preparations: histochromium for cardiology and histochromium for ophthalmology. Both, especially the latter, have been widely used in Russian practical medicine in the last five years [4] .",

Thus, by attaching two remains of amino sugars to the carbohydrate chain, they managed to synthesize substances that inhibit the virus of atypical pneumonia (SARS), an epidemic of which, according to experts' prediction, may lead to a loss of millions of human lives. Other conversions in the carbohydrate chain of glycyrrhizic acid yielded substances with antiviral activity towards dangerous viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus, the Ebola virus, and the Marburg virus. Polycyclic aglycone modification allowed one to synthesize chemical compounds capable of controlling sodium-potassium metabolism [5] .",

This is a system study of low-molecular metabolites, sui generis chemical \"fingerprints,\" which specific intracellular processes leave in the organism [10] . The subject of investigation here is a metabolome, a set of all low-molecular metabolites of an organism. In January 2007, American scientists who were involved in a Homo sapiens metabolome project reported the identification of 2500 endometabolites, 1200 medicinal drugs, and 3500 compounds of food origin in a human body [11] . Metabolomics was subdivided into lipidomics (science about all lipids in an organism), glycomics (science about carbohydrates), and other branches. Metabolome research became possible only following revolutionary progress in separation and identification methods in the late 20th-early 21st centuries. It should be emphasized that this research is still in the initial phase of development and is generally confined to the study of the human metabolome. The metabolomes of other inhabitants of the globe remain insufficiently explored. Metabolomics is closely related to so-called metabonomics, a science about dynamic changes of metabolomes in response to pathophysiological stimuli and genetic transformations. Metabonomics is also based on the application of modern achievements in NMR, mass spectroscopy, and high-performance chromatography. This new research area opens up broad vistas for diagnostics of various, including genetic, diseases. Obviously, efforts related to seeking and identifying natural products in various biological objects and studying their seasonal variation and concentration fluctuation depending on other factors are the crucial elements of metabolome projects.",

Then we switch to in vivo tests and use, for example, magnetic resonance imaging. We have one of only a few magnetic resonance tomographs for laboratory animals in Russia. When we use a model disease (for example, stroke) and substances selected in research at a cellular level, it enables us to assess the result already on laboratory animals. Of course, there are a great number of substances that show wonderful activity in vitro but fail to exhibit it in vivo. Nevertheless, this is the path taken by all researchers, because there is not yet an alternative, but to experiment in vivo on animals starting with extracts or unpurified fractions is very expensive.",
