A total of 339 laboratory-confirmed cases with 100 deaths were reported until January 14, 2014 (WHO, 2014) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that human infection with the avian influenza A H7N9 subtype has been detected. Prior to this, the few influenza A (H7) human infections that have occurred have generally resulted in mild illness and conjunctivitis, with only one reported death (Fouchier R A, et al., 2004; Tweed S A, et al., 2004) . Although some biological features are known and initial studies focused on pathogenesis have been performed (Zhou J, et al., 2013; Shen Z,, et al., 2013; Belser J A, et al., 2013) , several characteristics of this novel virus need to be revealed.",

These characteristics were accompanied by a high mortality rate, although currently, there are no pathological studies available on fatal cases. However, an ex vivo study showed that the viral antigen was detected in the epithelium of bronchus and lung tissues, as well as in type II pneumo-cytes (Zhou J, et al., 2013) .

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and human lung tissue explants were infected with virus in order to examine the ultrastructural and morphogenic characteristics of viral replication. Cells and tissue explants were infected with H7N9 virus (A/Anhui/1/2013, AH1) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 10 7 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ), respectively, for 24 h. Infected MDCK cell pellets and lung tissue blocks were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde (0.1 mol/L cacodylate-buffered, pH 7.2) and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (0.1 mol/L cacodylate-buffered, pH 7.2), dehydrated with a graded ethanol series, and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity epoxy resin (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, USA).

Of note, previous studies indicated that the morphology of influenza virus is host cell-dependent (Roberts P C, et al., 1998) and that some laboratory-adapted strains [e.g., A/Udorn/72 (H3N2)] are also filamentous (Bourmakina S V, et al., 2003) .",

In addition, the H7N9 virions were shown to bud from the tips of cellular microvilli, similar to that previously described (Kolesnikova L, et al., 2013) , and this may play a role in human-sourced transmission. Inclusion bodies consisting of dense tubular and sieve-like structures were seen in the nuclei or cytoplasm of some infected cells of human explant lung tissues, similar to those previously reported for other influenza A-infected cells (Goldsmith C S, et al., 2011; Josset L, et al., 2008) . In this study, dense tubules with an average diameter of 41 nm were found in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of pneumocytes and a sieve-like structure was observed in the cytoplasm (Figure 1, panel L, M, N, O, P) . In addition, a dense rodlike structure with a rough outer edge was seen in the nuclei of pneumocytes, which is similar to a previous report focused on the 2009 pdmH1N1 virus (Goldsmith C S, et al., 2011) . Previously, the M protein has been identified as a component of influenza nuclear tubular inclusion (Goldsmith C S, et al., 2011) . Although the biological function of the various structures in relation to the pathogenesis of this novel H7N9 virus will require further study, they may be related to functions such as excessive host immune-response. Along these lines, previous studies have shown that cytokine storms play a role in H5N1 infection or may enhance the spread of the virus in infected tissues (Otte A, et al., 2011; Lee SM, et al., 2009 ). Similar to H5N1 infections, a cytokine storm was also present in severe cases of H7N9 (Zhou J, et al., 2013). Thus, the formation of the structure observed in this study may be an accumulation of viral proteins, which may activate host response.",

Clinical investigations suggested that the novel H7N9 virus causes severe illness, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with high rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death (Gao H N, et al., 2013) . Although no human autopsy results on individuals infected with H7N9 have been reported, such studies would be helpful to understand lower respiratory tract infection to determine whether there is obvious damage to the lungs and whether this could be the cause of the high mortality rate.",

The distinguishing features of this virus include dense tubular structures and, also, a sieve-like structure in the cytoplasm and/or nuclei of pneumocytes. These findings lay the foundation to begin to understand the morphogenesis and pathogenesis of the H7N9 virus.",
