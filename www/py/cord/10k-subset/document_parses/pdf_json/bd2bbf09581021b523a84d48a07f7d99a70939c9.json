Methods: From January to September 2018, 24 patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, who were admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit of the Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Department of Henan Provincial People's Hospital, were randomly divided into two groups: integrated management group and control group. According to the admission criteria of the respiratory \"critical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated model\" prescribed by the above-mentioned hospital, patients were grouped. The professional respiratory therapy team participated in the whole treatment. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and oxygenation index of these two groups were dynamically observed, and the average hospital stay, 28-day mortality and patient satisfaction were investigated. Results: Patients in the integrated management group and control group were similar before treatment (P > 0.05). After treatment, the main indicators, the APACHE II score, CPIS score and oxygenation index, were significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05).

This integrated management model addressed three essential problems. First, this intervention could shorten the hospitalization stay, which eased the pressure of hospital and doctor. Besides, for the family of patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, the economic burden was decreased. Finally, what should be highlighted in this study was that the integrated management model could improve the treatment effect of patients with severe SAP, which provided a more feasible method to more patients with severe SAP. The integrated management model was accessible and feasible, because of the following reasons: under the background of the current economic level and the \"expensive medical treatment\" caused by the medical system and the national government's policy of advocating graded diagnosis and treatment, hospital management attaches great importance and supports. Medical and nursing staff possess extraordinary professionalism. Furthermore, adequate source of patients could be obtained. The management model was easy to be accepted by stakeholders and had a high retention rate: the national health insurance policy had been significantly improved, the reasonable diagnosis of patients was guaranteed by important policy documents in the hospital, the cooperation of relevant departments and the compliance of patients is good. In addition, by consulting the cost of some patients and estimating the number of days in hospital, the average cost of hospitalization of patients after intervention is lower than that of non-intervention group.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition, the investigators have drafted and formulated the criteria for the treatment of the integrated management model, defined the treatment scope, treatment features and treatment objectives of the critical wards for respiratory, sub-critical respiratory and rehabilitation, and the patients were treated and transferred strictly according to the admission criteria, in order to ensure the safety and homogeneity of these patients. Furthermore, the integrated management model would require that each patient is managed by the same physician-in-charge, in order to ensure the continuity of the patient's treatment and help improve the satisfaction rate. Finally, if a professional respiratory treatment team is established, which is consisted of senior respiratory physicians and several respiratory rehabilitation technicians, it can provide more evidence about how the treatment effect of integrated management model could be maintained or raised in the long term. It is worth noting that these staff receive experience unified training. They participate in the whole process of the critical respiratory support, sub-critical pulmonary early rehabilitation and pulmonary rehabilitation in the rehabilitation wards. Through the above-mentioned measures, the smooth implementation of the integrated model could be ensured. This integrated management model had a good effect in the clinical treatment of severe SAP. Pulmonary ventilation and/or ventilation function is decreased in patients with severe SAP. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen was lower than the normal range, with or without an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide. These suggested that these patients had respiratory dysfunction, which showed the importance of rehabilitation in decreasing mortality rate and prolonged length of hospital stay [16] . Hence, this should be assessed and intervened with pulmonary rehabilitation as soon as possible [17] . Pulmonary rehabilitation [18] , especially early intensive pulmonary rehabilitation, is an important link in the respiratory management of patients. For critical patients with mechanical ventilation [19, 20] , patients with inadequate nutritional support [21] , or patients with myasthenia induced by hormones and other drugs [22, 23] as the use of a home ventilator increases, patients with long-term ventilator support and some patients with long-term ventilator support caused by difficult weaning have significant surrounding skeletal muscle atrophy [24, 25] .
