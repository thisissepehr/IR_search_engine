Liver failure is often combined with fever, infection, and coagulopathy. How to identify and diagnose HLH early during the treatment of liver failure are essential due to lack of specific clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. Our current knowledge of HLH focuses mainly on clinical aspects. The average time from earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days in our study. This finding suggests that HLH occurs late in liver failure, specifically within 5 weeks after diagnosis of liver failure. Most of previous reports propose that acute liver failure is attributed to HLH-induced injury 9, 11 . To date, detailed mechanisms for HLH-mediated liver injury remain unknown. Probably, infiltration of activated hemophagocytic histiocytes or overproduction of cytokines in HLH can cause damage to one organ or multiple organs, especially liver injury 12 . Alternatively, liver injury can result from underlying diseases. We retrospectively summarized 11 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ patients diagnosed with liver failure, who did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of HLH (HLH-2004) on admission, but met the criteria during the course of treatment for liver failure. Based on dynamic changes in liver function, HLH mostly occurs in the middle and late stages, and even during recovery of liver failure,.as demonstrated by decreased bilirubin and INR (Table 2) .

In particular, some patients were diagnosed with HLH in the recovery phase of liver failure. This result is similar to that reported by Elia Apodaca et al., indicating that HLH is not typically observed in the first days or even weeks.

They were unresponsive to empiric or specific antibiotics at the time of HLH diagnosis; and 3 of 11 (36.36%) patients had no identifiable infectious sites. The presence of hemophagocytes in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes is one of the important conditions for HPS. Five (45.45%) patients did not exhibit hemophagocytes in early stage of the disease. Therefore, repeated bone marrow puncture biopsy is necessary in highly suspected cases. Hyperferritinemia is a hallmark of HLH.

In our study, 5 (45.45%) patients were treated with glucocorticoids for liver failure before the diagnosis of HLH. Given the early use of glucocorticoids, onset and diagnosis of HLH was likely delayed. Patients with liver failure are prone to various infections, and unable to tolerate the adverse effects of glucocorticoids.

In our study, 3 of 11 patients died of severe secondary infection in response to high doses of glucocorticoids, representing a life-threatening treatment-related adverse event. Thus, patients with liver failure and HLH can be treated with an initial dose of 1-1.5 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone via intravenous infusion.
