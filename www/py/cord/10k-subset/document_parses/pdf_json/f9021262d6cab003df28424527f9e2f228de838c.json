In contrast, the forward Euler method fails to meet the requirement (13) when applied to the decay, the logistic and the M-M equations. The following figures speak for themselves as far as the performance of the NSFD and standard schemes is concerned: Figure 1 for the decay equation and Figure 2 for the logistic equation with a = 1 and h = 1.8; Figure 3 for the M-M equation where on each picture, the three NSFD schemes (16)-(18) for b = 1 and b = 0 (decay equation) are compared to the exact scheme (8).

The more critical part is to check the conditions (H5) and (D5). In general, this amounts to checking that the basic reproduction number satisfies the condition R 0 \u2264 1, as stated in (26) . However, an additional threshold number \u03be < 1 may arise so that the GAS of the DFE is rather subjected to a more restrictive condition R 0 \u2264 \u03be . For \u03be < R 0 \u2264 1, we can have the backward bifurcation phenomenon whereby there is co-existence of the stable DFE with a stable endemic equilibrium. We investigated the backward bifurcation in [13] for a malaria model and in [17] for a disease, like the HIV/AIDS, with multiple strains.",
