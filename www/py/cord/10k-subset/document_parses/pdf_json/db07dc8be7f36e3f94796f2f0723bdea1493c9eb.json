The possible acidic nature of the HIF protein suggested further fractionation over DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex anion exchanger. Fig. 1 depicts the elution curves of the histoplasma inhibitory factor (HIF) from kidney as well as a number of protein standards on a Sephadex G--150 column (1.5\u00d7 30 cm). HIF, gamma globulin, serum albumin and ovalbumin were estimated at 280 m# and hemogloblin at 410 m#. (Fig. 4) Fig. \u00a2 depicts the relationship of V/Vo and log molecular weight of the HIF factor (from kidney) as well as a number of standard proteins. Their respective elution volumes molecular and log molecular weights are tabulated in Table I . WHITAKER (4) has shown that a linear relationship exists between V/Vo and the logarithm of the protein molecular weight, wher~ V is the protein retention volume (initial addition of protein sample to the peak of the eluted protein) and Vo is the column void volume. The column void volume was determined utilizing Blue Dextran (MW 2,000,000) and is the volume of buffer required to elute a substance not retained by inclusion within the column packing (the fractionation range for Sephadex G--150 is 5,000--200,000). The molecular weight of HIF (from kidney) utilizing the above procedure is estimated as 142,000.",

The latter column was developed with 0.02 M phosphate; 0.02 M phosphate -2 M sodium chloride (1 : 1); 0.02 M phosphate -4 M sodium chloride (1 : 1 ) and finally 4 M sodium chloride. The HIF was found in the 0.02 M phosphate -4 M sodium chloride eluate (fractions 11--17).Fig. 3illustrates the elution curve of HIF (from liver) after an initial fractionation over Sephadex G--150 followed by a passage over DEAE-Sephadex A--50 anion exchanger. The latter column was developed in an analogous manner to that described above for DEAE-cellulose. The HIF active material was eluted with 0.02 M phosphate-l M sodium chloride (1 : 1) buffer (fractions 14--17). As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 chromatography of liver homogenates on both DEAE-cellulose as well as DEAE-Sephadex A--50 (following initial passage over Sephadex G--150) indicates essentially similar Elution curve of histo4ntfibitory factor, (HIF), (liver) from Sephadex C~-150, refractionated over DEAE-cellulose.
