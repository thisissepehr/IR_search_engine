In locales where domestic animal rabies has not been controlled, dog bites are by far the most common mode of transmission. Where a thorough program of immunizing domestic animals has been implemented, such as North America and Western Europe, dogs are responsible for less than 5% of cases. In these developed regions, other domestic animals, including cows, cats, horses, and other farm animals are occasionally found to have the virus. 1 The risk conferred by wild animal bite varies widely, depending on species. Foxes, coyotes, wolves, and jackals are highly susceptible to rabies, whereas skunks, raccoons, bats, bobcats, mongooses, and monkeys have somewhat less susceptibility. Birds and reptiles, small rodents such as mice, chipmunks, and squirrels seldom carry the virus or transmit it to humans.",

Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) may show leukocytosis with mononuclear predominance, suggesting an encephalitis; protein and glucose levels are often normal, as are opening pressures. Electroencephalography is not diagnostic while computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging often do not reveal any abnormality. The failure of conventional studies to identify the disease underscores the importance of a carefully obtained history. 7 During the first week of the illness, immunofluorescent staining of hair follicle biopsies taken from the back of the neck is the most reliable test of infection.
