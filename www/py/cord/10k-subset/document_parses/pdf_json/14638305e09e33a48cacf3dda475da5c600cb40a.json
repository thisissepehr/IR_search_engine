Based on the clinical course, we assumed that this was VZV pneumonia, although we could not perform a bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm this hypothesis. On day 4 after admission, she exhibited neutropenia (<1000/mm 3 ), due to bone marrow suppression. On day 12, she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Although brain magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal any abnormal findings, we suspected encephalitis due to disseminated VZV infection and considered performing a lumbar puncture, although we chose not to perform the puncture, based on her unresolved bleeding tendency. Therefore, she remained in the intensive care unit for 16 days, and as her symptoms gradually improved, we resumed the oral immunosuppressants (FK and MP) after 12 days of cessation.

The patient exhibited severe hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase: 951 IU/mL), which gradually improved. PCR testing for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA revealed decreasing values after treatment with intravenous acyclovir in the first two weeks. However, the VZV-DNA remained high and tended to be elevated after five weeks of antiviral therapy. Therefore we added prophylactic oral acyclovir for two weeks after her clinical symptoms had improved. She was eventually discharged on day 86 after her admission, and has not experienced a recurrence with MOF, and it is noteworthy that the mortality rate is high once VZV infection leads to MOF.

Interestingly, Yamada et al. have also reported a case of severe disseminated VZV infection that occurred in an immunocompromised host, although that patient exhibited positive immunity [24] . However, we still believe that preoperative vaccination and positive immunity after the transplant are the critical considerations for managing patients after LDLT. We have performed 266 LDLTs between May 2001 and March 2015, including 36 (14.3 %) cases in which the patients were between 10-20-years-old at the LDLT; their VZV-IgG values at the LDLT are shown in Fig. 3 . Among these cases we found that three patients (including this present case) exhibited relatively low VZV-IgG values and another one patient did not have VZV-IgG at the LDLT. Therefore, we currently believe that an additional vaccination may be added for similar patients before their LDLT, although it is difficult to select an appropriate VZV-IgG cut-off value for the additional vaccination. Besides, we are considering about performing re-vaccination for patients who don't have positive immunity at 2 years after their LDLT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 170, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 730, "end": 736, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the present case, the patient had received an episode of steroid pulse therapy treatment and was receiving three immunosuppressants (FK, MP, and MMF). Although it is unknown whether the present case was primary infection or re-activation of the vaccine strain, it is possible that re-activation of the vaccine strain might have led to severe disseminated VZV infection [25] [26] [27] . Patients who are receiving a potent immunosuppressant regimen have a higher risk of latent infection or vaccine re-activation, and may develop severe illness if VZV infection occurs, regardless of whether it is primary infection or re-activation. Therefore, an early diagnosis and treatment are essential to rescue patients with disseminated VZV infection and MOF. In addition, when VZV infection is suspected in solid organ transplant recipients, it is critical to consider their vaccination history, anti-VZV titers, and presence of VZV-DNA via PCR, as this information can help facilitate an early and accurate diagnosis. If a diagnosis of disseminated VZV infection is made, appropriate early treatment is dictated by the patients'condition, and may include hospitalization, intravenous acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and the withdrawal of immunosuppressants. The primary treatment for disseminated VZV infection with MOF should address the organ failure and involve antiviral therapy, including intravenous acyclovir. In general, the antiviral therapy should be continued until all skin rashes are covered with scabs, and the organ symptoms have disappeared. Interestingly, Kronenberg et al. have reported four cases of disseminated VZV infection after solid organ transplantation in which the VZV-DNA levels were monitored via PCR [28] . Among those cases, one patient exhibited an increase in VZV-DNA that was accompanied by recurrent gastritis. In our case, we monitored the VZV-DNA levels via PCR, and they remained high (8.5 \u00d7 10 3 copies/mL), even after all skin rashes and organ symptoms had completely resolved. Therefore, we added prophylactic oral acyclovir and continued monitoring until a decrease in the patient's VZV-DNA was observed without any symptoms. This course appears to have been effective, as the patient has not experienced a recurrence. Similarly, monitoring for Epstein Barr virus DNA via PCR is and established method for prophylaxis and management of those infections, which are also common after liver transplantation [29, 30] . However, VZV-DNA monitoring via PCR is not an established method, although it appears to have the potential to be an effective biomarker for early diagnosis of VZV infection. In addition, this monitoring can evaluate the efficacy of treatment in cases of organ transplant recipients with severe disseminated VZV infection, especially in patients who have clinical symptoms of MOF.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 372, "end": 376, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 377, "end": 381, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1738, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2450, "end": 2454, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2455, "end": 2458, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, although disseminated VZV infection with MOF after pediatric LDLT is a life-threatening disease, it can be cured via an early diagnosis and intensive treatment.
