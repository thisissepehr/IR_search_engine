The previous SARS outbreak in this country was accompanied by contradictory information, while worries about wide-spread influenza led to discrimination worldwide. Early understanding of public threat perceptions is therefore important for effective public health communication and intervention. Methods: We interviewed 1011 respondents by phone two weeks after the first case. Questions examined risk awareness and media use, beliefs about the emergence of the threat and those most at risk, anxiety about infection and preventive and avoidant behaviours. Results: Results demonstrate moderate levels of anxiety but relatively high levels of trust towards government officials. Threat emergence was associated with hygiene levels, temperature change, floating pigs in the Huangpu River and migration to the city. Anxiety predicted both recommended and non-recommended behavioural changes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Comparatively high levels of trust in Chinese government advice about H7N9 contrast positively with previous pandemic communications in China.

While several variants of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been reported worldwide, poor management and initial denial of SARS in China made the H7H9 outbreak of particular concern [2] . During SARS the Chinese government kept the new outbreak secret, downplaying its emergence and treating it as a local issue best left to local bureaucracy [3] . Communication between provincial localities and bureaucratic departments was poor, and a lack of formal organisation meant poor provision of public health information, partly as a result of a separation between military and public healthcare [3] . Indeed it was not until SARS had spread to several neighbouring countries that it was publicly announced in China [4] . Partially as a result of criticism of their handling of the SARS crisis the Chinese government was keen to rapidly release accurate information about the novel H7N9 threat. Two weeks after the first case the Emergency Office of the Ministry of Health provided a series of behavioural recommendations, including taking greater care when preparing poultry or eggs, increasing hand-washing, ventilating homes and distancing oneself from those seeming to be infected [5] . Further, unlike in previous influenza crises, the Shanghai government closed all live poultry trade markets immediately following the first H7N9 fatality. In this study we examine early public responses to the H7N9 outbreak in southern Mainland China, including lay beliefs about the cause of the outbreak and those most at risk, trust in governmental responses, and uptake of recommended and non-recommended behaviours amongst citizens of Shanghai.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 92, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 443, "end": 446, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 691, "end": 694, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 811, "end": 814, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1283, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Previous research has indicated that lay beliefs about disease origins and those most at risk, and cultural perceptions about the purchase and preparation of birds, influence disease reporting, individual self-care and avoidance behaviours [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Risk associations between avian influenza and the poultry industry echoed both official communications from the Chinese government and broader public concerns about farming methods during earlier influenza A outbreaks [7] . In particular, poor ventilation, unsanitary practices at markets and by chicken sellers [7] , and the transport of poultry on long distance roads [11] , was associated with a previous outbreak of H5N1. During both SARS [12] and previous influenza outbreaks [13] association of the viruses with particular 'others' allowed individuals to feel relatively safe from infection, and contributed to the victimisation of some groups [14] . In particular, newly arrived migrants were seen as bringing new threats to an indigenous population [15] .

Total H7N9 confirmed laboratory cases/fatalities in Mainland China during this time ranged from 43/11 (April 12th) to 96/ 18 [1] . Data were collected via random digit dialing and computer-assisted telephone interviewing. Inclusion criteria were participants aged 18 or above who had heard of H7N9. Random phone numbers were generated by a computer system, developed by the Nankang IT Company specializing in survey and data collection. All interviewers were required to attend a 40-minute training session before using the system. When placing a call, the interviewer identified him/herself as calling from the university survey center, and explained to interviewees the purpose, procedure and confidentiality issues. Interviewees were informed that their participation was fully voluntary and they could end the interview at any time. Another household member was solicited for participation if an interviewee did not meet the age criteria or refused to participate, but only one household member was permitted to take the survey. Each generated phone number was tried three times before being replaced by an alternative random number. Three thousand and fifty-four telephone numbers were dialled, of which 1082 gave interviews, and 1972 refused to participate (response rate 35%).

Overall 5% of respondents relied solely on social media (microblogs, social media or cell phone newsletters), 28% combined media sources.

Forty-one respondents (4%) were 'worried a great deal' about personal infection, 121 (12%) worried 'quite a lot' , 264 (26%) worried a little and 582 (58%) not worried. Regarding concern about their family being infected 83 (8%) were 'worried a great deal' , 169 worried 'quite a lot' , 260 (26%) worried a little and 498 (49%) not worried. Sixty-seven percent (642) thought it unlikely that they personally would be infected, 310 (31%) that this was 'a little likely' and 11 (1%) that this was very likely. Since the H7N9 outbreak, 97 (10%) had been thinking a great deal more about life and death, 400 (40%) a little more about this and 500 (50%) no more than usual. Finally, 42 (4%) reported that H7N9 had brought a lot of difficulty to their daily life, 284 (28%) some difficulty, 120 (12%) a little difficulty and 562 (56%) no difficulty. Table 4 gives associations between anxiety and infection beliefs. Participants with greater anxiety associated floating pigs and the poultry trade hygiene with the outbreak, and thought children and the elderly were at greater risk. These associations, while significant, were however generally weak. The media source of information about H7N9 was unrelated to anxiety (for only traditional media odds ratio (OR) = .90, 95% confidence interval (CI) .76-1.06 p = .20; for only social media OR = 1.21, 95% CI .87-1.68, p = .26) Table 5 provides recommended and non-recommended behavioural responses to H7N9. The most widely adopted recommended response was home ventilation, with half reporting changing cooking behaviours, half avoiding sick people, nearly half changing washing habits. The most frequent non-recommended changes were the avoidance of buying poultry or eggs, and the avoidance of crowds. A minority of respondents reported mask wearing, cancelling or changing public transport travel plans, avoiding being physically close to migrants, or purchasing Chinese or Western medicine. Table 6 provides predictors of recommended and nonrecommended behaviours. As can be seen, participants carrying out two or more recommended behaviours were significantly higher on anxiety, perceived probability of personal infection and mortality awareness. Changing behaviours per the recommendations was associated with attributing H7N9 to floating pigs, hygiene standards in the poultry industry, hygiene in Chinese society, and migration and by perceiving children and those with weak immunity as particularly at risk. Participants who took part in nonrecommended behaviours were also higher on anxiety, perceived probability of infection and mortality awareness. Non-recommended behavior was predicted by associations of H7N9 with general hygiene standards and viewing children and those with weak immunity as at enhanced risk. Finally, purchasing Chinese medicine was associated with anxiety (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.31-2.04, p < .001) and death awareness (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.11-2.07, p = .01).

Public officials need to be aware that increased public anxiety may rapidly produce medical shortages.
