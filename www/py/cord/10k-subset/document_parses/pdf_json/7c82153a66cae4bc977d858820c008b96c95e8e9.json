In particular, drug induced exfoliative dermatitis (ED) are a group of rare and more severe drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) involving skin and mucous membranes and usually occurring from days to several weeks after drug exposure [2] . Erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the main clinical presentations of drug induced ED. Important data on ED have been obtained by RegiSCAR (European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions to Drugs: www.regiscar.org), an ongoing pharmacoepidemiologic study conducted in patients with SJS and TEN. Overall, T cells are the central player of these immune-mediated drug reactions. Immune-histopathological features allow to distinguish generalized bullous drug eruption from SJS/TEN [3] [4] [5] [6] . Still, treatment indication, choice and dosage remain unclear, and efficacy yet unproven. Here we provide a systematic review of frequency, risk factors, molecular and cellular mechanisms of reactions, clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapy approaches to drug induced ED.",

Albeit the lack of epidemiologic data regarding EM, its reported prevalence is less than 1 % [7] [8] [9] [10] . Several authors report the incidence of hospitalization for EM ranging from 0.4-6 cases per million people per year of northern Europe [11] to almost 40 cases per million people per year of United States [12] . EM usually occurs in young adults of 20-40 years of age [13] , with women affected more frequently than men (1.5:1.0) [14] . Recurrence occurs in around one-third of cases [15] and there is a genetic predisposition for certain Asian groups [16] . Mucosal involvement could achieve almost 65 % of patients [17] . EM's mortality rate is not well reported.",

Scientific evidences suggest a role for HLAs and drug-induced SJS/TEN, although some racial differences have been found that can be due to variation of frequencies of these alleles and to the presence of other susceptibility genes [26] . These studies have confirmed an association between carbamazepine-induced SJS/ TEN with HLA-B*1502 allele among Han Chinese [27] , carbamazepine and HLA-A*3101 and HLA-B*1511 [16] , phenytoin and HLA-B*1502 [28] , allopurinol and HLA-B*5801 [29] . For carbamazpine, several studies have found a common link between specific HLAs and different kinds of cutaneous adverse reactions, as for HLA-A*3101 in Japanese [30] and Europeans [31] . Because a certain degree of cross-reactivity between the various aromatic anti-epileptic drugs exists, some HLAs have been found to be related to SJS/TEN with two drugs, as the case of HLA-B*1502 with both phenytoin and oxcarbazepine [32] .",

The exact source of FasL production has not been yet identified as different groups have postulated that the production might be sought in keratinocytes themselves [33] or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [34] . In any case all authors concluded that the blockage of FasL prevents keratinocyte apoptosis [35] . The exact role of FasL in the pathogenesis of toxic epidermal necrolysis is still questionable especially because a correlation between serum FasL levels and disease severity has not been established and because its levels have been found to be increased also in drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and maculopapular eruption [36] . 2. Perforin/granzyme B pathway: Nassif and colleagues have proposed a role for perforin/grazyme B in keratinocyte death [37] . They found that the inhibition of these molecules could attenuate the cytotoxic effect of lymphocytes toward keratinocytes. A correlation between increased levels of perforin/granzyme B and the severity of TEN was also described [38] . 3. Granulysin: Granulysin is a pro-apoptotic protein that binds to the cell membrane by means of charge interaction without the need of a specific receptor, producing a cell membrane disruption, and leading to possible cell death. Chung and colleagues found an high expression of this molecule in TEN blister fluid [39] and confirmed both in vitro and in vivo its dosedependent cytotoxicity [39] . Moreover, after granulysin depletion, they observed an increase in cell viability. The serum levels of granulysin were also found to be increased in the early stage of SJS/TEN, but not in other cutaneous DHR [40] . 4. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1: TNF-\u03b1 seems also to play an important role in TEN [41] . The fluid of blisters from TEN patients was found to be rich in TNF-\u03b1, produced by monocytes/macrophages present in the epidermis [42] , especially the subpopulation expressing CD16, known to produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines [43] . TNF-\u03b1 has a dual role: interacts with TNF-R1 activating Fas pathway and activates NF-\u03baB leading to cell survival. Although the final result of this dual interaction is still under investigation, it seems that the combination of TNF\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 (also present in TEN patients) and the activation of other death receptors such as TWEAK can lead to apoptosis of keratinocytes [44] .",

EMM is a clinically severe, potentially lifethreatening, extensive sloughing of epidermis, generally involving mucosal tissue. In EMM lesions typically begin on the extremities and sometimes spread to the trunk. Infectious agents are the major cause of EM, in around 90 % of cases, especially for EM minor and in children. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 are the main triggers in young adults (>80 % of cases), followed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Mycoplasma pneumonia [55] [56] [57] [58] . Among drug related cases, the main triggering factors are sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), penicillins, and anticonvulsants (Table 1 ) [59] .

When less than 10 % of the body surface area (BSA) is involved, it is defined SJS, when between 10 and 30 % of BSA it is defined overlapping SJS/TEN, when more than 30 % of BSA, TEN [2] (Additional file 1: Figure S1, Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). SJS/TEN syndrome is associated with severe blistering, mucocutaneous peeling, and multi-organ damage and could be life threatening. TEN is also known as \"Lyell syndrome\", since it was first described by Alan Lyell in 1956 [2, 60] . Unlike EMM, SJS and TEN are mainly related to medication use. The strength of association with the development of SJS/TEN may vary among countries and historical periods, reflecting differences in ethnicities and prescription habits among the studied populations [61] [62] [63] [64] . Exposure to anticonvulsivants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine), cotrimoxazole and other sulfa drugs (sulfasalazine), allopurinol and oxicam NSAIDs [2] confers a higher risk of developing SJS/TEN. Several authors reported also an increased incidence for aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, and quinolones [61, 62] . Drugs such as paracetamol, other non-oxicam NSAIDs and furosemide, bringing a relatively low risk of SJS/ TEN a priori, are also highly prevalent as putative culprit agents in large SJS/TEN registries, due to their widespread use in the general population [63, 64] (Table 1) . Rarely, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, dengue virus, cytomegalovirus, and contrast media may be the causative agent of SJS and TEN [22, [65] [66] [67] .",

EMM is characterizes by target lesions, circular lesions of 1-2 cm of diameter, that are defined as typical or atypical that tends to blister. Typical target lesions consist of three components: a dusky central area or blister, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring of edema, and an erythematous halo on the periphery. Atypical target lesions manifest as raised, edematous, palpable lesions with only two zones of color change and/or an extensive exanthema with a poorly defined border darker in the center (Fig. 1) .

Trigger is an exotoxin released by Staphylococcus aureus [83] . A useful sign for differential diagnosis is the absence of mucosal involvement, except for conjunctiva. Main discriminating factors between EMM, SJS, SJS-TEN, TEN and SSSS is summarized in Table 3 [84]. 2) Pemphigus vulgaris, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid and linear IgA dermatosis have to be considered. In order to rule out autoimmune blistering diseases, direct immune fluorescence staining should be additionally performed to exclude the presence of immunoglobulin and/or complement deposition in the epidermis and/or the epidermal-dermal zone, absent in ED. The Nikolsky's sign is not specific for SJS/TEN, in fact it is present also in auto-immune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by large, tense bullae, but may begin as an urticarial eruption. Linear IgA dermatosis most commonly presents in patients older than 30 years. The lesions consist of pruritic, annular papules, vesicles, and bullae that are found in groups, clinically it is similar to dermatitis herpetiformis, without a gluten-sensitive enteropathy [85] . Bullous dermatoses can be debilitating and possibly fatal. Pemphigus vulgaris usually starts in the oral mucosa followed by blistering of the skin, which is often painful. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is associated with neoplasms, most commonly of lymphoid tissue, but also Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, sarcomas, thymomas and Castleman's disease.",

In contrast with DRESS, eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes are not described in patients with SJS or TEN. Both DRESS and SJS may have increased liver enzymes and hepatitis, but they occur in only 10 % of cases of SJS compared to 80 % of DRESS. Interstitial nephritis is common in DRESS syndrome, occurring roughly in 40 % of cases, whereas pre-renal azotemia may occur in SJS and TEN. 4) Graft versus host disease (GVHD) Acute GVHD usually happens within the first 6 months after a transplant. Common acute symptoms include abdominal pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, jaundice, skin rash and eyes dryness and therefore could mimic the prodromal and early phase of ED.

Patients present an acute high-grade of skin and mucosal insufficiency that obviously leads to great impairment in the defenses against bacteria that normally live on the skin, increasing the high risk of systemic infections. Moreover, transpiration and thermoregulation are greatly impaired with an elevated loss of fluids, proteins and electrolytes through the damaged skin and mucosae. For these reasons, patients should be admitted to intensive burn care units or in semi-intensive care units where they may have access to sterile rooms and to dedicated medical personnel [49, 88] .

An increased metabolism is typical of patients with extended disepithelizated areas. This hypermetabolic state is also furtherly increased by the inflammation present in affected areas. Early enteral nutrition has also a protective effect on the intestinal mucosa and decreases bacterial colonization.

If necessary, it can be repeated every 6-8 h. NSAIDs should be avoided as they can induce ED as well. 6. Painkiller therapy. Intravenous administration is recommended. In more severe cases continuous iv therapy can be necessary. Most common used drugs are: morphine, fentanyl, propofol and midazolam. 7. Antibiotic therapy. It is not recommended to use prophylactic antibiotic therapy. It should be used only in case of a documented positivity of cultural samples. If there is a high suspicion of infection without a documented source of infection, broad range empiric therapy should be started. 8. Antiviral therapy. Ganciclovir and cidofovir should be used when polymerase-chain reactions (PCR) on peripheral blood or other biological sample identifies a viral reactivation (HHV6, HHV7, EBV and CMV). In more severe cases antiviral therapies should be given together with intravenous immunoglobulins [93] . 9. Growth-factors (G-CSF). It recommended to used G-CSF in patients with febrile neutropenia [94, 95] . 10 . Plasmapheresis. It should be considered only once the patient is stable and if the skin damage is still ongoing and doesn't respond to other conventional therapies (corticosteroids or IVIG). Plasmapheresis may have a role in the treatment of ED because it removes Fas-L [96] , other cytokines known to be implied in the pathogenesis (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1) [97, 98] . Moreover Mawson A and colleagues hypothesized that the efficacy of plasmapheresis is able to reduce serum level of vitamin A. In patients with SJS/TEN increased serum levels of retinoid acid have been found. These levels could reflect the interaction between culprit drugs and aldehyde dehydrogenase that is the enzyme which metabolizes retinoid acid. Increased level of retinoid acid could be responsible for keratinocytes apoptosis [99] . 11. Topical treatment. Patients must be cleaned in the affected areas until epithelization starts. In spared areas it is necessary to avoid skin detachment. It is also recommended to void larger vesicles with a syringe. It is important to protect the damaged skin with sterile fat dressing especially in the genital area. 5 % silver nitrate compresses have antiseptic properties. Synthetic bilaminar membranes with silver nitrate have also a role in skin repairing and avoid protein loss through the damaged skin [100, 101] . It is advised against the use of silver sulfadiazine because sulphonamide can be culprit agents. Autologous transplantation of mesenchymal umbilical cord cells seems also to be highly efficacious [102] . Accurate eye cleaning with saline solution is fundamental for the prevention of synechiae and for reducing corneal damage. In more severe cases corneal protective lens can be used. It could also be useful to use artificial tears and lubricating antiseptic gels. The applications of topical cyclosporine and autologous serum have also been showed to be useful in refractory cases [103] . Oral hygiene with antiseptic and painkiller mouthwash (chlorhexidine + lidocaine + aluminum hydroxide) together with aerosol therapy with saline and bronchodilators can reduce upper airways symptoms.",

Corticosteroids could also reduce the amount of keratinocytes apoptosis and the activation of caspases [105] . In EMM their efficacy is demonstrated in controlling the evolution of the disease [106] . In SJS, SJS/TEN and TEN the efficacy of corticosteroids is far from being demonstrated. Recently, a meta-analysis based on 6 retrospective studies evaluating the role of corticosteroids alone or together with IVIG has been published [107] . In this study, 965 patients were reviewed. The authors concluded that they couldn't demonstrate corticosteroids efficacy in monotherapy, but the use of steroid alone is not linked to an increased risk of mortality due to infective complications [108, 109] .",

In the 5 studies that concluded negatively for IVIG, the dosage was below 0.4 g/kg/day and treatment was maintained for less than 5 days. Schwartz RA et al. [49] confirmed these results and even suggested that higher dosage regimen with 2.7-4 g/kg seem to be more effective in survival outcome. A recent review [111] on 33 pediatric cases of TEN and 6 cases of SJS/TEN overlap showed that therapy with IVIG with a dosage of 0.25-1.5 g/kg for 5 days resulted in 0 % mortality rate and faster epithelization. In conclusion, therapy wth IVIG should be started within the first 5 days and an high-dosage regimen should be preferred (2.5-4 g/kg for adults and 0.25-1.5 g/kg in children divided in 3-5 days).",
