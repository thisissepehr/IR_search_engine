Optimal methods for culture and identification are now well recognized.* Human embryonic fibroblasts such as WI-38 are generally used although certain sublines of HeIAa cells are also suitable. If isolation of rhinoviruses from patients is to be attempted nasal swabs will provide better specimens for this purpose than throat swabs, and nasal washings, collected after instilling balanced salt solution into the nose, are still better. The specimen is usually inoculated into WI-38 or similar cell cultures which are incubated on a roller apparatus at 33\u00b0C. Growth of rhinovirus is indicated by development of typical cytopathic effect and tests are usually done to confirm the lability of these viruses to treatment at pH 4.0 or lower.

It is recognized that the mucosal damage and swelling, hypersecretion and disruption of the ciliary clearance mechanisms will predispose to bacterial infection, which is readily revealed by bacteriological investigation. However, the comparative difficulty of carrying out similar virological investigations means that the role of viruses in bronchitis, 'infective asthma', sinusitis and otitis media is often ignored or forgotten. Nevertheless, the role of viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, in initiating attacks of bronchitis is now well documented and relatively high titres of rhinoviruses have been cultured from s p u t~m .~~.~~ Corresponding virological studies in acute sinusitis and otitis media have seldom been reported.

These authors also noted that 22 of 55 aspirates obtained by sinus puncture in acute cases showed less than 100 leucocytes per mm3 and that these aspirates generally yielded few bacteria.

As with any potential new drug, these trials must of course be preceded by very full toxicological investigations. Many of the anti-rhinovirus compounds so far studied have been poorly soluble, and their pharmacological properties have not favoured activity in nasal epithelial cells in vivo. In experimental trials they have often been administered as a nasal spray or as drops, and the highly efficient nasal mucociliary clearance mechanisms appear to enhance the difficulty of maintaining an adequate concentration of the compound at the site of infection.

            "text": "The scarcity and expense of human interferon and the recent discovery of its beneficial role in neoplastic as well as infectious disease has meant that its effects on respiratory tract infection have not yet been fully explored. Production of interferon by newer techniques including genetic engineering should remedy this deficiency. Experimental studies using human nasal epithelium confirm that prolonged contact of epithelial cells with high concentrations of interferon is necessary for induction of an antiviral state. 43 Experience to date with antiviral drugs and with interferon gives reason to suppose that prophylaxis or even therapy of viral respiratory infections will ultimately prove feasible. As with all forms of therapy the risk of the treatment needs to be compared with the risk or the disability inherent in the condition itselfand for this reason serious or disabling viral respiratory infections will be the first targets for medications whose long-term effects are necessarily initially unknown. A form of antiviral therapy found suitable for more serious infections will need to be proved to be of very low toxicity before its routine use in common colds can be justified. S u m m a r y and conclusions Common colds are caused by several different groups of viruses, rhinoviruses (of which there are more than 89 antigenic types) and coronaviruses being the commonest. These viruses replicate in nasal epithelial cells, and infectious virus is shed in nasal discharge concurrently with the development of symptoms. A variable degree of specific immunity follows the infection, measurable by suitable virological tests on patient's serum. Rhinoviruses can usually be grown in tissue cultures in the laboratory if the correct culture conditions are used, but isolation of some strains may be aided by the use of organ cultures of human embryonic nasal epithelium. Nasal organ cultures are also necessary for cultivation of many coronaviruses. These technical difficulties have meant that full evaluation of the pathogenic roles of rhinoviruses and coronaviruses has been slow and is still not complete. Rhinovirus infections may be spread both by the airborne and the manual routes. They occur all the year round, especially in autumn, whereas coronavirus infections are commoner in mid-winter and early spring. Rhinoviruses have been implicated as playing a role in bronchitis and 'wheezy bronchitis' of children, but their role in acute sinusitis and otitis media has not been adequately investigated. Vaccination against colds and their viral complications is not feasible because of the great multiplicity of antigenic types, but prophylaxis or therapy with wide spectrum antiviral substances such as interferon would be an ideal solution. Double-blind placebo controlled studies using interferon in rhinovirusinfected volunteers have given encouraging results, but similar experiments in volunteers using specifically anti-rhinovirus compounds have not yet revealed a drug active enough for clinical use, although compounds with good inhibitory activity in tissue culture and in organ culture are under study. At present, control may be attempted by interruption of routes of viral transmission, but the long term solution may lie in antiviral chemotherapy.",
