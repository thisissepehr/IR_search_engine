Herein we determined the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea-derived polyphenol, on tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)-mediated expression of the IL-8 gene in A549 cells. EGCG inhibited TNF-amediated IL-8 gene expression in a dose response manner, as measured by ELISA and Northern blot analysis. This effect appears to primarily involve inhibition of IL-8 transcription because EGCG inhibited TNF-a-mediated activation of the IL-8 promoter in cells transiently transfected with an IL-8 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. In addition, EGCG inhibited TNF-a-mediated activation of Ik B kinase and subsequent activation of the Ik Ba / NF-k B pathway. We conclude that EGCG is a potent inhibitor of IL-8 gene expression in vitro. The proximal mechanism of this effect involves, in part, inhibition of Ik B kinase activation.",

            "text": "The medicinal effects of green tea (Camellia sinensis) have a long, rich history. The Buddhist monks of ancient Japan recognized green tea for its medicinal powers and brought it back from China as early as the eighth century. The monk Eisai, considered the \"Father of Tea\" in Japan, wrote in his book Maintaining Health by Drinking Tea in 1211: \"Tea is a miraculous medicine for the maintenance of health. Tea has an extraordinary power to prolong life.\" More recently, there is increasing interest 1 in the beneficial effects of green tea on health and disease prevention. Epidemiological studies have suggested that the regular consumption of green tea reduces the risk of cancer (1) (2) (3) (4) . Additional studies have demonstrated the potent anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and bactericidal properties of green tea or its constituents (4) (5) (6) . Consumption of green tea may also prove to play an adjunctive role in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (7) . Although green tea consists of over 2000 components, the flavinol polyphenolic compounds are the most abundant, accounting for nearly 30% of the dry weight of green tea leaves (3) . These compounds are commonly known as catechins and include epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epicatechin (EC) (Fig. 1) . Apart from their ability to sequester metal ions and scavenge reactive oxygen species (8, 9) , the catechins, espe- cially EGCG, have been shown to inhibit several proteins involved in inflammation, including lipoxygenase (10) (11) (12) , cyclooxygenase (11, 13, 14) , nitric oxide synthase (15, 16) , tumor necrosis factor-a (17), xanthine oxidase (18) , and nuclear factor k B (16, 19) .",

NF-k B, a member of the Rel family of transcription factors, is usually present in the cytoplasm of the cell in an inactive state bound to a related inhibitory protein known as Ik B. Ik B physically masks the nuclear translocation sequence of NF-k B, thereby retaining it in the cytoplasm in an inactive state. A common pathway for the activation of NF-k B occurs when Ik B is phosphorylated by the recently described Ik B kinase, specifically at the serine-32 and -36 residues of Ik B (23) (24) (25) (26) . Phosphorylated Ik B is targeted for rapid ubiquitination, which results in degradation by the 26S proteasome. Degradation of Ik B unmasks the nuclear translocation sequence of NF-k B, allowing NF-k B to enter the nucleus and direct transcription of target genes (24) . The current data strongly support a central role for this pluripotent transcription factor and support the concept of therapeutic strategies targeting the NF-k B pathway.",

Chemotactic cytokines (chemokines) represent a large family of peptides that play primary roles in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes during inflammation. IL-8, a member of the CXC family of chemokines is the principle neutrophil chemoattractant and activator in humans (31) . Neutrophil infiltration appears to be an early and important event in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury, and it appears that IL-8 has an important role in medi- ating this process (32) (33) (34) . The importance of IL-8 in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury is further implicated by several studies demonstrating increased levels of IL-8 in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with acute lung injury (35) (36) (37) .",

Therefore, inhibition of NF-k B would be expected to modulate the effects of TNF-a-mediated induction of IL-8. Herein we show that the green tea-derived polyphenol, EGCG, inhibits TNF-a-mediated expression of the IL-8 gene in A549 cells, at least partially through a mechanism involving the inhibition of IKK, and subsequent activation of the Ik B / NF-k B pathway.",

The 5' flanking region of the IL-8 gene contains putative binding sites for several transcription factors, including AP-1, NF-k B, and NF-IL6. Several studies have suggested that, unlike the NF-k B site, the AP-1 and NF-IL6 sites are not essential for induction of the IL-8 gene (41) . Studies specifically addressing TNF-a-mediated induction of IL-8 in A549 cells have further supported the notion that IL-8 gene expression only requires an intact NF-k B site (42) . In our experiments, we used a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the \u2212 97 bp 5\u2032 flanking region of the IL-8 gene, which contains the NF-k B binding site. The binding site for the transactivating protein AP-1 lies further upstream from the region cloned into our luciferase reporter plasmid. Our data would suggest that EGCG inhibits TNF-a-mediated IL-8 gene expression through an additional promoter site such as AP-1 or NF-IL-6, or alternatively by affecting the stability of the mRNA transcript. Further studies will be required to address the effect of EGCG on these additional transcription factors, specifically pertaining to the effects on IL-8 gene expression in response to TNF-a in A549 cells.",
