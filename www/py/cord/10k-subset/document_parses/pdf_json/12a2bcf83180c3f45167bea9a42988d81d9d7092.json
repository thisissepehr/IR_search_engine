Our aim was to discriminate the components of the working pressure of the respiratory system in infants on MV with severe bronchiolitis admitted to two PICU's. Methods: Infants younger than 1 year old with acute respiratory failure caused by severe bronchiolitis underwent neuromuscular blockade, tracheal intubation and volume controlled MV. Shortly after intubation studies of pulmonary mechanics were performed using inspiratory and expiratory breath hold. The maximum inspiratory and expiratory flow (QI and QE) as well as peak inspiratory (PIP), plateau (PPL) and total expiratory pressures (tPEEP) were measured. Inspiratory and expiratory resistances (RawI and RawE) and Time Constants (K TI and K TE ) were calculated. Results: We included 16 patients, of median age 2.5 (1-5.8) months. Bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus was the main etiology (93.8%) and 31.3% had comorbidities. Measured respiratory pressures were PIP 29 (26-31), PPL 24 (20-26), tPEEP 9 [8-11] cmH2O. Elastic component of the working pressure was significantly higher than resistive and both higher than threshold (tPEEP -PEEP) (P < 0.01). QI was significantly lower than QE [5 (4.27-6.75) v/s 16.5 (12-23.8) L/min. RawI and RawE were 38.8 (32-53) and 40.5 (22-55) cmH2O/L/s; K TI and K TE [0.18 (0.12-0.30) v/s 0.18 (0.13-0.22) s], and K TI :K TE ratio was 1:1.04 (1:0.59-1.42). Conclusions: Analysis of respiratory mechanics of infants with severe bronchiolitis receiving MV shows that the elastic component of the working pressure of the respiratory system is the most important. The elastic and resistive components in conjunction with flow profile are characteristic of restrictive diseases.

[13] . They observed a decrease in C RS in spontaneous breathing infants with bronchiolitis when compared with healthy infants. More recent studies found the same alteration in C RS , most of the time attributed to significant air trapping and lung hyperinflation [14] . We were able to describe the threshold component in our patients, and autoPEEP was not clinically relevant, a finding comparable to that in previous studies [13, 14] . Threshold or autoPEEP is a minor contributor to the total working pressure [15] . When compared to the few reports of C RS of infants without significant respiratory disease, patients of our study had consistently a decreased of C RS [16] . Conflicting data exist with regard to the resistive airway component during severe bronchiolitis. Krieger et al. found that there were not clinical significant differences between inspiration and expiration in infants during bronchiolitis; even more, the latter was shortened. In that study measured K TI :K TE ratio in children with bronchiolitis was higher than normal subjects (mean 1:1.1). They stated that this finding could be explained by Otis' theory of the equality of time constants (which are the product of compliance and resistance) in a system with different airway's caliber (unequally obstructed due to varying values of resistance), and flow is rapid in such a system, measured value of resistance would be the one of the larger airways [13] . It is important to realize that respiratory system mechanics measurements in patients under controlled positive pressure MV can be altered by the way the parameters are set. For instance, high ventilatory settings can elevate PIP, without P PL changes [15] . A clinical study in 82 pediatric patients with bronchiolitis showed PIP oscillations between 25 and 45 cmH 2 O when children were ventilated with moderate to high V T (10-15 ml\u00b7kg \u22121 ) [17] . An augmented V T can also require longer expiratory times to allow the passive expiration, increasing the risk of air trapping and decreasing compliance due to hyperinflation. One of the strengths of our study is that MV settings were standardized and compatible with current standard of care: V T and P PL were limited and low Q I were applied. This could have caused the low resistance to expiratory flow observed in our cohort. Normal values of Raw E for this specific age group are scarce, but our patients' Raw E was lower than data from premature newborns without significant respiratory disease on spontaneous breathing [18] . Another consideration is the instrumentation used to measure the resistance in our study. When it is measured in a Y-piece, the resistive component of instrumental airway is included. De la Cruz et al. described in 21 patients that under these conditions the peak inspiratory pressure needed to ventilate the infant's lungs is overestimated compared with actual airway pressure. It would be difficult to correct this overestimation since measurements with a tracheal catheter would be really challenging (or even contraindicated) in small infants [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 561, "end": 565, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 825, "end": 829, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 994, "end": 997, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1079, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1238, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 1999, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2258, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2450, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3084, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3634, "end": 3638, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An interesting finding was the inverse correlation between C RS and Raw E . As previously reported in patients with ARDS, this observation shows that lungs with lower C RS had higher elastic recoil [20] . This finding is concordant with our results, showing that during severe bronchiolitis the elastic component of working pressure is predominant, similar to ARDS pathophysiology. Hammer et al. described that ten out of 37 patients with severe bronchiolitis fulfilled the AECC criteria for ARDS [21, 22] . It is important to note that these infants had consolidation or infiltrates on 4 quadrants on the chest x-ray with a Murray's lung injury score greater than 2.7. In our view, this group of RSV-induced ARDS is different from the cases we are describing. We excluded patients with more than 2 quadrants of infiltrates on chest x-ray (or obvious x-ray patterns of ARDS), and also all the measurements were done within 1 h after intubation.
