            "text": "Gastrointestinal infections associated with diarrhea have been suggested to alter mucosal permeability to intact macromolecules, possibly inducing subsequent sensitization to dietary proteins in predisposed subjects (13, 14) . However, data on changes in intestinal permeability to intact proteins during acute enteritis are still very controversial, perhaps because gastroenteritis etiologies have not been accurately defined. In a previous investiga- tion, we demonstrated that experimental secretory diarrhea (cholera type) was not associated with increased intact protein absorption (3). In a recent study, Keljo er al. (4) reported that conventional piglets infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus developed a marked increase in H R P permeability 12 h pi when structural lesions of the mucosa were observed. In the present study, we correlated the time course of another animal model of viral enteritis with changes ,occurring in intestinal protein uptake and degradation according to the microbial environment. In mice, the peak age for rotavirus infection is between 6 and 1 1 days (1 5). The severity of the disease depends on the nutritional status (16, 17) , the local immune system, and the availability of virus specific receptors on the enterocytes (12, 15, 18, 19) . The reason why we chose to work with conventional and germ-free mice was to examine the effect of a viral infection (to the exclusion of any other coincidental infection) and to establish the role, if any, of intestinal microflora on the time course of this infection as well as any related modifications of intestinal protein transport. In a previous examination of the developmental pattern of protein absorption in conventional and germ-free suckling mice (5), we found a short transient increase in intact protein absorption at 3 and 4 days of age. but no further modifications until adulthood. The same pattern was observed both in conventional and germ-free mice. but the latter transported four times fewer proteins than their conventional counterparts. This new finding indicates that intestinal microflora has an important role, be it direct or indirect, in absorptive processes. As the intestinal permeability to H R P did not vary postnatally from day 5 to 2 1, we chose to infect our pups on day 5 in order to exclude any developmental variations in macromolecular absorption. In the present study, intestinal permeability to intact H R P greatly increased in the course of viral enteritis in infant mice. This increase was transient and occurred early after infection in conventional pups and later in germ-free pups. Furthermore, when intestinal microflora was absent, clinical and physiological disturbance were more severe, i.e. larger weight losses after rotavirus infection, and a more marked and long lasting augmentation in intestinal permeability to intact proteins. Theoretically, these differences in the clinical pattern of viral enteritis in the presence or absence of intestinal microflora might be due to the incidence of an immune protection of conventional mice. since seropositive mothers are known to protect their suckling pups which consequently exhibit less severe infections (12. 20) . However, in the present study we used only seronegative mothers so that a protection of the pups by their mother did not seem to interfere. On the contrary, infectious virus was present longer in mucosal homogenates of conventional pups.",

Indeed. only the very small segment of mucosa mounted in the Ussing chamber was assumed to reflect the entire jejunal surface. The possibility of nonspecific leakage of proteins through the damaged tissue can be excluded since no major histological lesions were detected by light microscopy.

This strongly suggests that the increased H R P permeability was not due to paracellular leakage but rather to transcellular absorption. The possible dissociation of the two protein transport pathways (direct and degraded) with the predominant involvement of the direct nondegrading pathway in the present pathological situation can be explained in two possible ways. This could be due either to the appearance of a new cell type pool that transfers H R P intact or to the increase of the minor direct pathway in cells that already possess the degrading pathway. The immaturity of the epithelial layer after the viral infection might also be a factor influencing the increased absorption of the undegraded HRP.",

However, the timing of virus excretion was different in conventional and germ-free mice since titers were still high after day 8 pi in conventional mice, while they were very small in germ-free mice. This suggests that there is no strict correlation between virus excretion and diarrhea, since diarrhea was observed from days 2 to 8 pi in both conventional and germfree mice. The differences observed in the alteration of macromolecular transport during the time course of the disease, in conventional and germ-free mice. underlines the importance of the microecological environment of the host on the response to the infection.

Open circuit conditions were used in H R P flux experiments. Tissue conductance (G) was assessed regularly by passing a current through the preparation. Isc was then calculated. taking into account the fluid and filter resistance. H R P (Sigma, Type VI) at a final concentration of 10 pM (0.4 mg/ml) was added to the mucosal compartment. \"-HRP, prepared and stored as previously reported (I), was also added as a tracer (1.35 pCi). For 110 min, 800-pl samples were taken from the serosal compartment at 10-and 20-min intervals and replaced by fresh buffer. The rate at which intact H R P was transferred to the serosal side was determined by enzymatic assay of 200-p1 aliquots according to a modified version of the Worthington method(10). Results were expressed as pmole. cm-' intact H R P accumulated in the serosal compartment after 110 min of experimentation. Stu~isticul rrnulj~.sis. Differences between infected and control mice were assessed by Student's I test for comparison of means and ranges.",
