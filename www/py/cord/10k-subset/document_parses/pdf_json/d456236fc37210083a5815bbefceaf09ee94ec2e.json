In this study, we examine the role of podocytic angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) and prorenin receptor (PRR) in podocytic apoptosis in IgAN. Polymeric IgA (pIgA) was isolated from patients with IgAN and healthy controls. Conditioned media were prepared from growth arrested human mesangial cells (HMC) incubated with pIgA from patients with IgAN (IgA-HMC media) or healthy controls (Ctl-HMC media). A human podocyte cell line was used as a model to examine the regulation of the expression of AT1R, PRR, TNF-a and CTGF by IgA-HMC media. Podocytic nephrin expression, annexin V binding and caspase 3 activity were used as the functional readout of podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media had no effect on AngII release by podocytes. IgA-HMC media significantly up-regulated the expression of AT1R and PRR, downregulated nephrin expression and induced apoptosis in podocytes. Mono-blockade of AT1R, PRR, TNF-a or CTGF partially reduced podocytic apoptosis. IgA-HMC media activated NFjB, notch1 and HEY1 expression by podocytes and dual blockade of AT1R with PRR, or anti-TNF-a with anti-CTGF, effectively rescued the podocytic apoptosis induced by IgA-HMC media. Our data suggests that pIgA-activated HMC up-regulates the expression of AT1R and PRR expression by podocytes and the associated activation of NFjB and notch signalling pathways play an essential role in the podocytic apoptosis induced by glomerulo-podocytic communication in IgAN.

The disease is characterized by mesangial deposition of polymeric IgA1 (pIgA) [2] , followed by proliferation of mesangial cells, increased synthesis of extracellular matrix and infiltration of immune cells [3] . The absence of known IgA receptors in podocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) and the lack of IgA binding to these cells support the pathologic finding that IgA is only deposited in the mesangium in IgAN [4, 5] .

Podocytes are positioned strategically along the glomerulotubular axis, yet their role in mediating the glomerulotubular crosstalk in IgAN has not been addressed. We have previously demonstrated that podocytes play a contributory role in the development of interstitial damage in IgAN by amplifying the activation of TEC with enhanced TNF-a synthesis following inflammatory changes of HMC [4] . We have also shown that humoral factors, predominantly as tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b) released by HMC following IgA deposition down-regulated the expression of nephrin and ezrin in cultured podocytes [6] .

We have further demonstrated that mesangial-tubular crosstalk triggered by mesangial IgA deposition induced the overexpression of AT1R and PRR in podocytes, and these two receptors utilize different signal mechanism contributing to the podocytic apoptosis. Under normal physiological condition, podocytes express a functional intrinsic RAS characterized by enzymatic activities predominantly leading to ANG-(1-7) and ANG-(1-9) formation, and AngII degradation. ANG-(1-9) counteracts the proinflammatory actions of AngII. It has been suggested that podocytes play a specific role in the maintenance of intraglomerular RAS balance [9] . Nonetheless, these enzymatic activities are altered in nonphysiological environment such as hyperglycemia that mimics diabetic kidney disease [9, 15] . We have shown here that neither AngII release, nor the expression of enzymes that controlling the formation or degradation of AngII, changes in podocytes following IgA-HMC media incubation. However, there were significant increases in the expression level of AT1R and PRR. We have previously documented a glomerular-tubular crosstalk triggered by mesangial IgA deposition activates the up-regulation of AT1R in TEC and leads to the tubulointerstitial damage [16] . A similar up-regulation of AT1R in podocytes associated with mesangial IgA deposition was observed in the current study, and this up-regulated AT1R expression is controlled by podocytic TNF-a/TNFR1 axis through signal Fig. 4 Effect of blockade of RAS, NFjB, or TNF-a receptors on TNF-a or CTGF release by podocytes cultured with IgA-HMC media.

Despite a link between TNFR1 activation by TNF-a and AT1R up-regulation has not yet been reported in podocytes, data generated from cardiac fibroblasts culture depicted that TNF-a up-regulates AT1R density and enhance the pro-fibrotic effect of AngII [17] . In addition, activation of NFjB is essential for the AT1R upregulation by TNF-a in cardiac fibroblast [18] . That piece of evidence from cardiac fibroblast may provide intriguing possibility that similar mechanism may take place on podocytes, which deserves further investigation. The renin-angiotensin system plays an indisputable role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. A distinctive RAS presents in different resident kidney cells [19, 20] . AngII [21] . Hypertensive rats induced by continuous AngII infusion show podocytic apoptosis associated with decreased nephrin expression [22] . The slit diaphragm protein nephrin play a pivotal role in preventing passage of protein through the glomerular barrier [23] . In human study, a marked reduction of nephrin mRNA and extracellular nephrin was detected in IgAN but not in minimal change nephropathy (MCN) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [24] . Podocyte loss is associated with the increased disease severity in IgAN and contributes to the progressive glomerular sclerosis and filtration failure [25] . Consistent with these results, our current data demonstrated IgA-HMC media induced apoptosis and reduced nephrin expression by podocyte. Unlike the results obtained from rodent experiments, our data from human podocytes culture showed that the Fig. 8 Dual blockade of the podocytic NFjB and Notch1 activation rescues nephrin expression and prevents apoptosis.

The binding of prorenin to the prorenin receptor not only causes a non-proteolytic activation of prorenin leading to the activation of the RAS, but also stimulates the receptor's own intracellular signaling pathways independent of the RAS. Within the kidney, PRR is present in the glomerular mesangium and podocytes, which play an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Angiotensin-independent effects of prorenin activation have been reported. Renin and prorenin induced TGF-b release in mesangial cells in the presence of renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors and/or AT1 receptor antagonists [27, 28] . Interestingly, our present data have shown that other than AT1R, expression of PRR was also up-regulated by IgA-HMC media. This up-regulated PRR expression elicited the downstream events including increased CTGF synthesis and podocytic apoptosis. However, the upregulated podocytic CTGF synthesis and apoptosis by IgA-HMC media was not solely PRR dependent, the AT1R upregulation by IgA-HMC media also contributed noticeably to these process as described earlier. CTGF is a crucial effector for the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis [29] . CTGF is mainly expressed in podocytes and its expression is markedly up-regulated and associated with fibrotic lesions [30] . Overexpression of CTGF in murine podocytes exacerbates proteinuria and through a functional impairment and loss of podocytes [31] . High glucose stimulates mesangial cells to secrete TGF-b, which is stored on cell surface of podocytes as latent inactive form. The latent TGF-b is activated by AngII dependent process to induce podocytic CTGF synthesis and contributes to the podocytic apoptosis [32] . In rat mesangial cells, high glucose increases expression of PRR, and leads to the enhanced production of CTGF [33, 34] . We have previously demonstrated that pIgA from IgAN patient increased TGFb production by HMC via increased AngII [35] . In the present study, we observed the up-regulation of podocytic PRR, CTGF and apoptosis in podocytes by IgA-HMC media.
