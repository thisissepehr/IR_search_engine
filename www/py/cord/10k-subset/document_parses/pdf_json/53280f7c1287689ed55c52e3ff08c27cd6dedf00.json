Prophylaxis with antiviral medications also may prevent illness but depends on the availability of large antiviral drug stockpiles and also does not provide long-term immunity. By contrast, immunization with a well-matched pandemic vaccine would provide active immunity and represent the most durable pandemic response.

To achieve this, over $1 billion has been allocated (1) to expand domestic egg-based influenza vaccine production, (2) to support advanced development of new vaccine production technologies, such as growth of influenza virus in cultured cells or development of recombinant vaccines, and (3) to support the advanced development of \"antigen-sparing\" approaches, such as new adjuvants, that can stimulate a more robust immune response, allowing manufacturers to reduce the amount of antigen in each dose and formulating the antigen produced into more vaccine doses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Efforts to Avoid the Need for Prioritization"}, {"text": "Until the promise of these approaches is realized, however, pandemic influenza vaccine supply is likely to be far less than pandemic response needs. For the 2007-2008 influenza season, most of the influenza vaccine administered in the USA was produced in other countries, and these sources of supply may not be available during a pandemic. Moreover, the amount of antigen needed to achieve a protective immune response could be substantially greater for a pandemic virus compared with seasonal influenza viruses. A clinical trial of an unadjuvanted candidate H5N1 vaccine showed that two doses containing 90 mg of hemagglutinin antigen were needed to achieve an immune response that may correlate with protection in more than half of healthy adult recipients (Treanor et al. 2006) . This per dose concentration is sixfold higher than the quantities of hemagglutinin antigen included for each strain in the seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV), and twofold higher than the total hemagglutinin in a standard dose of TIV. Since two doses of the H5N1 vaccine were needed to achieve adequate immunogenicity, the quantity of antigen needed to immunize an adult would be 12-fold higher than the amount of antigen to vaccinate against a seasonal strain. Initial trials with other candidate H5N1 vaccines that contain alum, novel lipid-based adjuvants, or that use the inactivated whole virus documented immunogenicity with two doses of 30 mg, 3.8, and 10mg, respectively (Bresson et al. 2006; Leroux-Roels et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2006 ). While additional studies are needed, these results suggest a potentially wide range of antigen quantities needed in different vaccine formulations, which will directly impact how quickly the population can be effectively vaccinated in the event of a pandemic. Vaccine supply, therefore, would depend on the production capacity for different vaccine formulations at the time a pandemic occurs. Under some scenarios, vaccine supply would be very limited, whereas under others, assuming success in evaluating and licensing new formulations and producing them in the USA, supply may be robust.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 759, "end": 780, "text": "(Treanor et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1493, "text": "(Bresson et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1519, "text": "Leroux-Roels et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1535, "text": "Lin et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Efforts to Avoid the Need for Prioritization"}, {"text": "The time required to develop, license, and manufacture pandemic influenza vaccine is also an important variable.

In the 1957 pandemic, the first US cases occurred in June but no community outbreak occurred until August and the first pandemic wave did not peak until the end of October; by this time almost half of the approximately 60 million vaccine doses eventually produced had been delivered. By contrast, in 1968, the pandemic was not recognized until later in the year, and at the time initial US outbreaks began few persons had been vaccinated (Schwartz and Wortley 2006) . Because influenza vaccine production capacity, vaccine formulation, and the time from pandemic recognition to onset of US outbreaks all are uncertain for the next pandemic, we are unable to predict how many people will be vaccinated before pandemic disease is widespread.

The approach to using a limited supply of pandemic vaccine may differ depending on which goals are considered most important. Results of mathematical models suggest that vaccinating school-aged children can best reduce transmission of influenza, slowing disease spread and reducing overall community attack rates (Germann et al. 2006) . While studies of vaccination for seasonal influenza support a strategy of vaccinating children to protect others in the community through herd immunity (Monto et al. 1969; Piedra et al. 2005; Reichert et al. 2001) , uncertainty in the amount of vaccine that will be available or its timeliness make reliance on trying to induce indirect protection a risky strategy. Hospitalizations and deaths from pandemic illness can be reduced by directly vaccinating those at highest risk for these severe outcomes. Based on age-specific mortality rates in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, vaccinating persons \u00b365 years old would have prevented substantially more deaths compared with vaccinating other age groups, despite the lower vaccine efficacy among the elderly (in 1918 this would not have been the case because of the high mortality rate among young adults). Another approach to reduce the health impacts of a pandemic would be to vaccinate healthcare workers so that they can continue to provide care to others. In an unmitigated pandemic, the demand for healthcare services will be overwhelming at a time when healthcare workers may be out of work due to illness, the need to care for sick family members, or because they are afraid of becoming infected at the workplace. A survey of county health department workers in Maryland found that 46% of respondents indicated they would not report to work in a pandemic. In a multivariable analysis, confidence in one's personal safety was significantly associated with a willingness to work (Balicer et al. 2006) . Whether response to a survey is predictive of actual behavior is unclear; anecdotally, virtually all healthcare workers in Toronto reported to work during the SARS outbreak, despite the fear associated with a new disease and the spread that occurred within hospitals.

The working group considered the epidemiology and impacts of pandemics, the groups at highest risk for complications and death from influenza, vaccine efficacy, critical societal functions, and ethical issues. The prioritization strategy proposed by the committees included vaccinating groups defined in tiers and subtiers, depending on vaccine supply. Groups that were prioritized for earliest vaccination included healthcare workers, manufacturers of pandemic vaccine and antiviral drugs, and persons at high risk of severe illness and death. Personnel in critical infrastructure sectors other than healthcare were prioritized after these groups, which include over 100 million persons.

The federal working group process included consideration of the scientific issues reviewed in the earlier prioritization process, assessment of mathematical modeling results, and discussion with public health officials, critical infrastructure providers and homeland and national security experts.

Public meetings were held in two demographically different communities with participants recruited by community groups. Stakeholder representatives from government, healthcare, business, and community organizations participated in a third meeting. Each meeting included initial presentations to educate participants on influenza and influenza vaccine, pandemics, and the rationale for vaccine prioritization. Participants discussed potential objectives of pandemic vaccination in small groups and then met in a plenary session where the objectives were discussed further. Finally, participants rated the importance of each of ten proposed objectives using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from \"extremely important\" (a score of 7) to \"not important\" (a score of 1). Despite the differences between groups in terms of geographic location, demographic characteristics, and occupational background, the values expressed at each meeting were similar (Table 2) .

Scores were assigned from a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 7 = extremely important to 1 = not at all important Key outcomes of this process included the importance of achieving multiple objectives with the pandemic vaccination program, the value given to protecting critical services and exposed workers, and the preference for vaccinating children before those who are most likely to become sick or to die-older adults and those who have underlying medical conditions. Results from the public and stakeholder engagement process provide insight into the values and preferences of the population but do not translate directly into a prioritization strategy for pandemic vaccine. We therefore conducted a formal decision analysis to assess the priority of different population groups. We identified 53 potential target groups for pandemic vaccination defined by their occupation or by their age and health status. The degree to which each group met each of the ten vaccination program objectives was then assessed and scored: how well each group met objectives related to occupational role or exposure was scored by representatives on the federal working group; for objectives where clinical trial or epidemiological data can be used to assess how well a group met an objective, scoring was done by influenza experts from CDC and academic medical centers. The score assigned to each group for each objective was then weighted by the average rating of the objective's importance from the public engagement and stakeholders meetings ( Table 2) . A total score was calculated for each group as the sum of the objective scores multiplied by their weights for the ten vaccination program objectives, as described by S x = O 1 w 1 + O 2 w 2 + ... + O 10 w 10 , where S x is the total score for group x; O 1-10 are the scores the group received for each of the ten objectives; and w 1-10 are the weights for each of the objectives. 1 As an example, medical care practitioners received high scores from the working group for objectives of fighting the pandemic and providing care, providing an essential community service, being vulnerable due to their jobs, and being at risk of spreading infection to those who are unprotected (their patient population). Because most healthcare workers are healthy adults who would respond well to vaccination, they also received high scores for the objective of being most likely to be protected by the vaccine. Medical care practitioners score lower for providing essential economic services, protecting homeland and national security, and being most likely to get sick or die (as some may have underlying medical conditions or be 65 years old or older).

A major problem could be having to turn away persons who are panicked about the severity of a pandemic yet do not meet the criteria for vaccination at that time under the prioritization strategy. Currently, no comparable program exists and each step will need to be planned and tested in preparedness exercises. Effective communications also will be important. While substantial public involvement in the development of the vaccine prioritization strategy increases the chance that the approach will be acceptable to the public, communications goals will be to assure the public that the entire population will have the opportunity to be vaccinated, to communicate the rationale for prioritization and the prioritization strategy, and to inform people when it is their turn to be vaccinated. Rationing of healthcare is not an issue that most Americans have had to face in the past. Outside of military settings, healthcare services generally have not been limited by availability as much as by economic or geographic factors.
