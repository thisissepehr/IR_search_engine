Certain human gastrointestinal pathogenic viruses, including the recently described reovirus-like agents [1] and possibly the Norwalk agent [2] , appear to replicate in vitro only in human intestinal organ culture. Similarly, certain strains of coronavirus and rhinovirus replicate only in human tracheal organ culture [3, 4] . In contrast to monolayer tissue cultures, the organ cultures maintain intact tissue organization and contain a variety of differentiated cells that preserve many in vivo metabolic functions [5] . Thus the organ cultures more closely resemble in vivo target organs for these viruses and may therefore represent a superior in vitro model for the study of viral pathogenesis and for the possible evaluation of antiviral mechanisms.",

Two drugs that have been demonstrated to have antiviral activity in tissue culture and that are currently being considered for clinical use in man are adenine arabinoside (ara-A) [8] and iododeoxyuridine (IUDR) [9] . The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effect of these compounds on morphology, function, and viral replication in organ cultures. The increasingly frequent reports of herpetic tracheitis [10] and esophagogastroenteritis [11] in patients with compromised host defenses suggested that. investigation of Herpesvirus hominis infections of trachea and intestine would be clinically relevant. Therefore, human fetal intestinal and tracheal organ cultures were established and infected with H. hominis types 1 and 2 and with vaccinia virus; the effects of various concentrations of ara-A and IUDR were then examined.",

Human fetal intestinal and tracheal organ cultures were established as previously described [5] from 10to 14-week-old embryos obtained from therapeutic abortions performed via hysterectomy or hysterotomy. Briefly, the intestine and trachea were dissected in toto, cut into I-mm 2 sections, and placed on 50-x 15-mm plastic petri dishes that had been scratched with a scalpel. Five pieces were placed at equidistant points on each dish, and each piece was oriented under the dissecting microscope with the mucosal side up. Leibowitz (L-15) medium (Flow Laboratories, Rockville, Md.) (1.25 ml) was added, and was supplemented with a final concentration of 0.2% bovine albumin, 2.0 mM glutamine, 250 J.Lg of streptomycin/ml, and 33 j.Lg of tetracycline/ml. The dishes were placed on a rocker platform, which completed a full cycle eight times per min, and were incubated at 34 C. Ara-A and IUDR were added to the medium in the concentrations indicated below. Fluid was harvested every 48 hr, frozen at -70 C, and replaced with 1.25 ml of identical medium containing an antiviral drug.",

The pathology was not observed under the dissecting microscope but was seen only by light microscopy of fixed sections. Early histopathology consisted of focal loss of epithelial cells, with progression to ulcer- tectable in the medium of either system when the concentrations mentioned above were employed. The development of histopathology and the loss of contraction or ciliary motion were prevented when the above inhibitory concentrations were present.

The MICs of both drugs against each virus appear to be consistently higher in intestinal than in tracheal organ cultures (table 1). This differential sensitivity to antiviral activity appears to be independent of the peak titers of viral growth in the absence of drug, since the titers in intestinal culture are similar to those in tracheal culture.

In addition, the tissue culture values vary with the strain of virus, the type of cell, and the assay system employed [14, 15, 18] . In this laboratory, MICs for ara-A and IUDR against the same strains of virus in a variety of tissue culture systems are two-to 50-fold less than the above organ culture values (R. Dolin and M. Coker, unpublished observations).",

Since both ara-A (A. J. Glazko, personal communica-tion) and IUDR [21] are poorly absorbed after oral administration, it is possible that topical administration of these nucleoside analogues may provide a local antiviral effect while bypassing potential systemic toxicity.

In the intestinal organ cultures, suppression of smooth muscle contraction was noted by days 6--8, along with histopathologic disruption in the explants. The histopathology was observable directly through the dissecting microscope and consisted first of swelling (' 'ballooning' ') of the villi (figure 3), followed progressively by flattening of the villi, loss of the epithelial border, and frank destruction of the explant within 72 hr after the onset of \"ballooning.\" Similar changes were noted by light microscopy of fixed intestinal explants (figure 4). The earliest findings were blunting of the villi with superficial ulceration of the epithelial cells, progressing to denudation of the entire epithelial surface (figure 4B).
