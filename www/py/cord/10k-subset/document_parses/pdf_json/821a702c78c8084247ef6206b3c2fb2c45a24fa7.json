Transfection and transgenic studies have identified the open reading frame (ORF) present in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) as encoding superantigen function. In this study, we have used an in vitro translation system in an attempt to characterize the molecular nature of the protein encoded by the 3' ORF of Mtv-8. Using various constructs encoding full-length and truncated versions of the ORF product, we report that the hydrophobic region close to the amino terminus of the 36-kDa protein can function as a transmembrane domain. Protease digestion experiments also demonstrate that the protein has a type-I1 transmembrane conformation with an extra-cytoplasmic carboxy terminus. Since this hydrophobic region is conserved between all known MMTV, we speculate that LTR ORF, including those proposed to encode the minor lymphocyte stimulatory antigens, are also capable of encoding type-I1 transmembrane glycoproteins. The polymorphism between MMTV LTR ORF products, which correlates with deletion phenotypes, is predominantly in the carboxy-terminal extracellular region, consistent with a major role in interaction with the T cell receptor.",

Additionally, the cellular response of T cells can differ between \"superantigen\" and T cells involves a processed form of the antigen being presented in the antigen-binding pocket of a major histocompatibility molecule [l]. In conventional antigen recognition, all variable germ-line segments (Va, J,, Vp, Dg and Jp), as well as N-region additions, contribute to the specificity of the TcR [2] . In contrast to this, Tcells stimulated by certain bacterial toxins [2] and the recently identified endogenous \"superantigens\" encoded by germ-line copies of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV; [3] [4] [5] [6] ) have a particular TcR Vp usage. The major effect of endogenous superantigens is seen as thymic deletion of T cells expressing particular Vp regions. In contrast, in the periphery, superantigen interaction leads to polyclonal activation of T cells expressing such TcR Vg regions with limited contribution from other TcR components [2] .",

Previous in vitro translation studies have shown that the 3' LTR ORF encodes four overlapping polypeptides of 36,24,21 and 18 kDa by the use of alternative initiation sites [12, 131. In vivo identification of MMTV ORF has been limited to the product of the partially deleted LTR present in the lymphoma cell line EL4 [14] .

It is clear, however, that the protein product from construct 4 does not change in molecular weight in the presence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 2,  lanes 7, 8; even though the truncated sequence retains two potential glycosylation sites at Asn 132 and 147, see Fig. 1J ).

To improve the efficiency of initiation at the first methionine residue, MMTV fragments were cloned into a transcription vector (see Sect. 2.1) containing the 5' UTR from EMCVupstream of its cloning site [17] . Fig. 2 shows that constructs 1,2,3 and 4 are all capable of producing major protein products of predicted size, 36, 31,36 and 22 transmembrane domain. Trypsin treatment in the presence of microsomes was, therefore, used to define, by the degree of protection, the extent to which the protein has translocated across the microsomal membrane, and hence its membrane orientation. To simplify the interpretation of these experiments, the competitive N-glycosylation inhibitor N-acetyl-Asn-Tyr-Thr-carboxyamide was included. Fig. 4A illustrates that for the product of constuct 1, a significant decrease of approximately 3 to 5 kDa is seen after trypsin treatment (lanes 1 and 2) , suggesting that the majority of the protein is protected by the microsomal membranes. (B) shows that in the absence of microsomes no such protection is observed. These results are consistant with the hydrophobic domain (residues 38 to 63) anchoring the protein in a type-I1 membrane configuration. The product of construct 4 does not show evidence of microso-ma1 protection from trypsin cleavage (data not shown) consistant with its lack of a membrane translocation domain.The product from construct 1, (Fig. 4A, lane 1) in the presence of the glycosylation inhibitor is the same size as that seen in the absence of microsomes (Fig. 2 ). The correlation between carboxy sequence and Vg deletion phenotype has suggested a role for t h e carboxy terminus in determination of Vg deletion specificity; for a type-I1 membrane protein this region would be able to interact with the TcR without requirement for cellular processing. One possibility, currently under investigation, is that the type-I1 glycoproteins encoded by the 3'0RF of MMTV may bind either intracellularly or at the plasma membrane with class I1 and that this complex is what is recognized by endogenous superantigen-responsive T cells either thymically (leading to deletion) or peripherally (leading to expansion).",

One important aspect of endogenous superantigens is whether they are presented as conventional peptides in association with MHC molecules or independently of such processing events, as are bacterial toxins. This study provides information concerning the molecular characteristics of the Mtv-8 ORF protein. Our in v i m analysis has shown that the 3' ORFof Mtv-8 is capable of encoding a type-I1 45-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. Sequence analysis of the ORF from various MMTV reveals a high degree of similarity[lo]. The sequence of the ORF from Mtv-8, 9 and 11, for example,which we have previously shown to be involved inTcR Vpl1+ T cell deletion[6], are very similar to each other, especially in the carboxy terminal region. Further, MMTV responsible for deletion of other classes of Vg+ Tcells have a carboxy terminal region distinct from that of Mtv-8, 9 and 11 (for example Mtv-l,Vg3 deletion; Mtv-C3H,Vp14/15 deletion[lo]",
