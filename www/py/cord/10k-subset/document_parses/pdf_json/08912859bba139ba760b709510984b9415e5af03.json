In the present study, we investigated both the role of \u03b14 integrin and the therapeutic effect of HCA3551, a newly synthesized orally active small-molecule \u03b14 integrin antagonist, in the development of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). The mRNA levels of \u03b14 integrins were significantly up-regulated in the CNS of mice with TMEV-IDD as compared with na\u00efve mice (*p<0.05). HCA3551 treatment in the effector phase significantly suppressed both the clinical and histological development of TMEV-IDD. The number of infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in the CNS was significantly decreased in the mice treated with HCA3551 (**p<0.01). The labeling indices for CD68 antigen and the absolute cell numbers of TNF-\u03b1-producing CD4 + T cells and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells were significantly decreased in the CNS of mice treated with HCA3551 (*p<0.05).

Previous studies have suggested that Th17 cells express lower amounts of \u03b14 integrin than Th1 cells and Th1 cells preferentially infiltrate the spinal cord via an \u03b14 integrin-mediated mechanism, whereas the entry of Th17 cells into the brain parenchyma occurs in the absence of \u03b14 integrins but is dependent on \u03b1L\u03b22 expression (42) .
