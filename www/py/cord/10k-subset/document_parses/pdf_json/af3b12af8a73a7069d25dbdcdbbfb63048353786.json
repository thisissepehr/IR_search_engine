No benefit or harm from magnesium was observed in several subgroup analyses. Further, there was no evidence of benefit for magnesium in the major secondary endpoints of treatment for heart failure and defibrillation for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. As the investigators point out in the discussion of their paper, this means that 68 684 patients have been studied over the past 22 years in 14 randomized trials of magnesium in myocardial infarction. 3 Unfortunately, despite the potential cost-effectiveness, the inescapable conclusion now appears to be that intravenous magnesium sulphate does not have a routine therapeutic role in the management of STEMI, apart from repletion of documented hypomagnesaemia.",

The primary endpoint was FEV 1 at 240 min, which they found was higher in the magnesium treated group (mean FEV 1 48.2% predicted vs 43.5% predicted in the placebo group; mean difference 4.7%; 95% CI 0.29-9.3%; P = 0.045). The effect of magnesium was greater in patients with a lower initial FEV 1 . However, the use of magnesium did not improve overall hospital admission rates. These results support the conclusion that magnesium sulphate is a weak bronchodilator and may be a useful adjunct to standard therapy in patients with acute severe asthma. 5 Craig T Hore, MBBS Absolute lymphocyte counts taken on the first day of admission to hospital may be useful in predicting SARS. Hong Kong has been one of the worst areas in the world to be hit by SARS. 1 Emergency and primary care physicians are faced with the dilemma of dealing with a disease that is novel and easy to miss. The case definition of SARS has been described but is evolving as new information arises and now includes fever, chest X-ray changes and laboratory tests for coronavirus. 2 This definition differs from that of the Hospital Authority and Department of Health of Hong Kong, and so in the early phase of the crisis there is no single definition or single test that is indicative of the disease.",
