However, the application of PEEPe can produce a certain level of hyperinflation, an undesirable effect which can limit the efficacy of the reduction of respiratory work. The objective of the present study has been to determine if the encrease in end expiratory lung volume (EELV) originated by the PEEPe is related to static lung compliance (SLC). We have studied 14 patients on mechanical ventilation in whom an AP of between 4 and 12cmH20 was detected. On applying PEEPe equal to half the AP, the EELV increased slightly (77_+64 ml) and was not related to pulmonary compliance. When PEEPe equal to the AP was applied, the EELV increased by 178_+110mi (range 45-375ml, p<0.05), and there was a significant correlation with SLC (r = 0.659, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the application of PEEPe equal to the AP causes a moderate increace in EELV. However, in patients with high pulmonary compliance this increase can be more important and must be taken into account when considering the use of PEEPe during weaning.",

            "text": "In patients weaning from mechanical ventilation, the presence of AP can contribute to respiratory muscle fatigue since for each spontaneous inspiration, the patient must generate a pressure of greater magnitude but opposite in sign to the alveolar pressure before any air intake is achieved. This involves an additional effort and may contribute to weaning failure. In this context, the application of extrinsic PEEP (PEEPe) similar to the AP can reduce the respiratory work by suppressing the pressure gradient between the alveoli and the exterior [4, 5] . The efficacy of this manoeuvre is optimal if the application of PEEPe originates no increase in lung volume, but given that the pulmonary parenchyma is not a homogeneous structure and that the commonest method of measuring AP (occluding the expiratory port of the respirator) measures the average AP, the application of a PEEPe equal to the AP can distend pulmonary zones with a below average AP, and so produce a certain level of hyperinflation which worsens the strength-length relationship of respiratory musculature [6, 7] . Data in this respect are scare, although they generally show that the increase in end expiratory lung volume (EELV) is small [4, 5] but variable [8] . Among the factors governing the magnitude of this increase in EELV, it seems that the absence of airflow limitation may play an important part [8] , however in our opinion, other factors like the quantity of zones with low AP as well as the compliance of such zones, can influence the increase of EELV. Given that the static lung compliance (SLC) is an easily quantifiable parameter, if it proved useful as a predictor of increases in EELV originated by PEEPe in patients with AP, it would be a valuable clinical aid. Therefore the objective of the present study was to find out if the increase in EELV originated by PEEPe in patients with AP is related to SLC.",

This figure was previously calculated using the expired volume/airway pressure ratio on allowing a tidal volume while keeping the patient connection closed. The expired volume obtained in these conditions is a consequence of the circuit's distensibility. This expired volume was measured using a Wright Spirometer fitted in the expiratory port of the respirator, and the airway pressure was measured with the respirator manometer.

After recording at least 10 normal expirations, an expiration was prolonged for between 15-25 seconds, so that an above normal expiratory volume was obteined, since the gas causing the AP had been allowed to escape (b in Fig. 1 ). When ventilation was restarted, the first 3 -4 expirations were below normal due to the gas trapping caused again by the AP (c, d and e in Fig. l) . The volume of gas trapped by the AP (AEELV-AP) was measured as the sum of the differences between the normal expiratory volume and each of the expirations be- . Note that no inspired volume is recorded. Only expired volume is recorded with the pneumotachograph fitted in the expiratory port of the respirator, behind the expiratory valve. After each expiration, when no flow is detected by the pneumotachograph, the recording pen automatically returns to the base line. a, expired volume; b, increase in the expired volume on prolonging the expiration; c, d and e, the volumes of gas trapped on restarting mechanical ventilation. When ventilation is restarted, the first expirations are of smaller volume than normal, since part of the gas remains trapped in the lungs and originates the AP. c, d and e represent together the volume of gas causing the AP. Normally b = c + d+ e, but on occasions, when expiration is prolonged, the escape of gas is momentarily interrupted or the flow is so low, that the pneumotachograph returns to the base line before all the gas has been recorded. In these cases, b does not represent the entire volume of gas originating the AP, while the sum of c + d+ e does indeed reflect more accurately the increase in lung volume responsible for the AP was previously filled with oxygen and if any pressure was recorded on connecting it to the tracheal tube (auto-PEEP), it was disconnected to allow the escape of gas trapped [9] , and was reconnected to the patient several seconds later.

Record of expiratory volume of patient number 5 who presented a static lung compliance of 25 ml/cmH20 and an AP of 9 cmH20. The arrows in the upper and lower part of the record indicate the direction of the graph (right to left). Recorder speed is 25 s/cm. In A, the patient is being ventilated with a PEEPe of 4 cmH20. On removing the PEEPe (arrow), a slight variation in the expired volume is produced, which corresponds to the volume trapped in the circuits by the PEEPe (3.7 ml/cmH20 of PEEPe). In B, the patient is being ventilated without PEEPe. The large arrow indicates the reduction in expired volume on applying PEEPe of 9 cmH20, and the small arrow indicates the increase in expired volume on removing the PEEPe lung volume [4, 5, 8] . Gay et al. studied the effect of the patient's expiratory flow pattern on the increase in EELV originated by the PEEPe. From the data shown in their results table, it can be seen that the increase in EELV is extraordinarily variable from one patient to another, going from 130 ml/cmH20 of PEEPe to 11.6 ml/cmH20 of PEEPe. They found that in patients not presenting airflow limitation, any level of PEEPe produces an increase in EELV. On the other hand, in those patients with airflow limitation an increase in EELV is only seen when the PEEPe is increased to levels similar to those of the AP. We have not studied the expiratory flow pattern of our patients, but the moderate dispersal of some of our resuits can probably be related to the expiratory flow pattern. However, SLC has been a good indicator of the increase in lung volume originated by a PEEPe equal to the AP.",

            "text": "Contrary to expectations, we have found no significant relationship between the volume of gas liberated on prolonging the expiration (the volume of gas generating the ALP) and SLC. The cause of this lack of relationship is perhaps the fact that the act of prolonging expiration does not necessarily guarantee the escape of all the gas that is originating the AP. It is possible that in some alveolar zones, the AP is contributing to their stabilisation, so that the escape of part of this gas may destabilise them, provoking an airways collapse which prevents its complete emptying. Another factor which could have partly affected the determination of the volume of gas trapped by the AP is the difference between the oxygen consumption and the CO2 inflow into the lungs during the period of apnea on the prolongation of the expiration [10] . It is known that during apnea, the C02 inflow to the lung is very small, while in contrast the oxygen uptake from the lung continues at a similar rate as prior to the apnea. This difference in behaviour is because in the case of oxygen, the alveolar-capillary pressure gradient is maintained by the continuous renewing of capillary blood. By contrast, in the case of CO2, as the alveolar gas is not renewed, the alveolar CO2 pressure rapidly equilibrates with the venous CO2 pressure and the inflow of CO 2 to the lung is consequently minimal. This difference could have had an unequal influence on the determination of EELV-AP, having a proportionally greater effect on determinations from patients with less gas volume trapped by AP.",

It could be thought that the results would be different in patients with spontaneous breathing, since in these circumstances, the increase in EELV may originate an increase in expiratory muscle activity [11] , which would diminish the volume of trapped gas. However, Petrof et al. [5] , in a group of 7 patients with an AP of 9.9+_1.1 cmH20 who were in spontaneous breathing during weaning, found that the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 10 cmHzO produced an increase in EELV of 242+_55 ml, which is equivalent to 24 mt/cmH20 of CPAP, an increase similar to that which we have found (27 ml/ cmH20 of PEEPe). Therefore it is to be expected that in patients breathing spontaneously, SLC would also be a good predictor of the level of hyperinflation originated by PEEPe.",
