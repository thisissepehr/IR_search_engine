However, his fever did not improve after 4 days of treatment. On January 13, the son was admitted to Putian Municipal No. 1 Hospital (Putian, China) because he experienced more severe coughing and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the H7N9 virus was detected in his throat-swab samples by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Oseltamivir was given as an antiviral treatment against H7N9 infection; however, the son, unfortunately, died on January 15. The second patient was the index patient's 77-year-old mother, who was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection through monitoring and testing of close contacts with the confirmed index patient. On January 5, she saw a countryside doctor because of coughing and dizziness, and her physical condition improved following a 2-day treatment. She was investigated because of her close contact with her son, and her throat-swab specimen was collected and analyzed on January 15. On the following day (January 16), she was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection, and she was transferred to the Affiliated Hospital of Putian University (Putian, China) and placed in an isolated ward. Her vital signs and a routine blood test were normal during her stay in the hospital; however, oseltamivir was administered and she was not discharged from the hospital until two consecutive PCR assays of her throat-swab specimens were negative on January 22. The index patient lived with his mother in a two-floor house in Putian city, Fujian Province, where live poultry were freely bred in the backyard, which was full of chicken feathers and feces. According to the recollections of the patient's family members, most of their neighbors bred live poultry, and some of the poultry died prior to his reported illness. Before the son became ill on January 5, his mother lived in extremely close contact with him, including feeding chickens, sitting, and eating together until January 13. The second family cluster included a grandfather and his grandson with confirmed H7N9 virus infections (Fig. 1B) in Xiamen, Southeast China. The index patient (the grandfather) was a 58-year-old man that had a headache and chills with a normal body temperature at the onset of illness on January 6, 2015. At dusk, the grandfather visited a rural hospital and received an antondin injection and traditional Chinese medicine (no exact details are available). During the period from January 7 through 13, he had recurrent clinical manifestations, including weakness, coughing, shortness of breath, and fever, and his highest body temperature was 39.6 \u00b0C. Then, he visited Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China), and he was given cefotaxime treatment for 3 days. Because of the development of a more severe shortness of breath, the grandfather was hospitalized on January 15, and a routine blood test revealed a 2.75 \u00d7 10 9 /L white blood cell (WBC) count, which comprised 81% neutrophils and 16% lymphocytes. Oseltamivir, cefotaxime, doxycycline, and other symptomatic treatments were given for anti-infective therapy. He was diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown origin by consultation with multi-disciplinary experts on the morning of January 16, and his throat-swab specimens were collected and transferred to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention to detect the H7N9 virus. On the afternoon of January 16, he was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection. Because his physical condition improved, he was discharged from the hospital on February 4. The second patient was the index patient's 2-year-old grandson, who was admitted to Zhongshan Hospital because of facial paralysis. Because of his close contact with his grandfather, the grandson was investigated, and his throat-swab specimens were sampled on January 16. He was confirmed to have an H7N9 virus infection by RT-PCR on January 17, and he had a fever of 39 \u00b0C in the afternoon. Then, he was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University (Xiamen, China) and placed in an isolated ward. A routine blood test revealed a 1.04 \u00d7 10 10 /L WBC count, comprising 71% neutrophils and 13% lymphocytes. After the virus failed to be detected in the throat-swab specimen, the grandson was discharged from the hospital on January 23. The grandfather frequently visited a live poultry market near his house prior to the onset of his illness. After the grandfather became ill on January 6, he had close contact with his grandson (from January 10 to 14), including sitting and eating together, as well as kissing and hugging.

To date, the virus has caused four outbreaks in humans, and most cases occurred during winter and spring 25 . The H7N9 virus is a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus, and it does not cause identifiable illness or death in poultry, whereas humans act as sentinels for the presence of these viruses in avian infections 17 . Currently, humans get infected with the H7N9 virus predominantly through contact with asymptomatic poultry, and sporadically via direct contact or exposure to environments that are contaminated with infected poultry 1 . However, there are increasing reports of clusters of human cases infected with the H7N9 virus, among which some cases have close contacts and some share common exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets, thereby resulting in difficulty in identifying viral transmission routes (either via common exposure or human-to-human transmission) 26, 27 . However, close, persistent, and unprotected contacts with symptomatic cases with H7N9 virus infections may cause human-to-human transmission, although this transmissibility is limited and non-sustainable 13, 14 . Therefore, it is important to examine the likelihood of efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus. Here, we reported the epidemiological, clinical, and virologic characteristics of two family clusters with H7N9 virus infections in Southeast China to clarify the transmission and pathogenicity of the virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 221, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 434, "end": 436, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1005, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1008, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1218, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1221, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A phylogenetic analysis showed that all eight gene segments of H7N9 viruses in the same family cluster shared high sequence similarities and clustered together in a single branch of a phylogenetic tree, which suggests that the index patients and secondary patients from the family clusters were infected via human-to-human transmission or through exposure to common live poultry or contaminated environments. We collected specimens from live-poultry markets neighboring the patients' houses, and H7N9 viruses were detected in the poultry washing water and cage surface cleaning wipes by RT-PCR (Supplementary Table S1 ); however, it was unfortunate that the H7 and N9 gene sequences were not obtained at that time. It was estimated previously that the mean incubation period of the H7N9 virus is 3.3 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.7 days), with a 0.76 coefficient of variation (95% CI, 0.1 to 5.5) 28, 29 . The onset of H7N9 infection-like syndromes occurred on the same day in the two patients from cluster 1 (January 5, 2015), and the time required for human-to-human transmission was not met, implying a simultaneous or common route of infection. For cluster 2, the index patient visited a live poultry market frequently prior to the onset of his illness (January 6, 2015), with close contact with the secondary Table 3 .

The secondary patient became ill on January 17 without exposure to any live poultry market or direct contact with any poultry. Therefore, we believe that the most likely route of infection was human-to-human transmission for cluster 2. Gene mutations of the H7N9 virus have been demonstrated to change its pathogenicity, transmissibility, host adaption, and drug resistance [30] [31] [32] . Amino acid substitutions in the PB2 protein (L89V, K526R, Q591K, E627K, and D701N), PB1-F2 protein (N66S), M1 protein (N30D and T215A), and NS1 protein (P42S and D92E) increased H7N9 virulence in mice [33] [34] [35] , and amino acid substitutions in the HA protein (G186V and Q226L), PB2 protein (D256G and K702R), PA protein (V100A, K356R, and S409N), and NS1 protein (N205S and G210R) altered species-associated signature positions 36 . Previous studies have shown that the PB1 I368V mutation may increase the transmissibility of the H7N9 virus in ferrets 37 , and the PB1 L589P mutation and the PA L336M mutation increase H7N9 viral replication in mammalian cells 36 . In addition, the NA mutations E119V, I22K/R, and R292K resulted in a reduction in the sensitivity of the H7N9 virus to NA inhibitors 38 , and the M2 S31N mutation may cause the H7N9 virus to become resistant to adamantine-derived drugs 39 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 912, "end": 915, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 916, "end": 918, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1973, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1978, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1983, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2191, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2196, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2197, "end": 2201, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2422, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2546, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2655, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2791, "end": 2793, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2894, "end": 2896, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 594, "end": 617, "text": "(Supplementary Table S1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1336, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To analyze the virulence, transmissibility, drug-resistance, and antigenicity of the H7N9 virus from the family clusters, we performed an in-depth analysis of the genetic characteristics of the four H7N9 viruses.

It was reported that the HA G225D mutation in the H1N1 virus potentially contributes to the specificity of HA for the sialic acid receptor Sia(\u03b12-6) Gal, thereby enabling the replication and transmission of the virus within and among humans 43 . In addition, we found that all four isolates were resistant to amantadine and rimantadine because of the S31N substitution in the M2 protein 44 . However, no substitutions were detected in the enzyme-active functional domains of the NA protein, suggesting that it is sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir.
