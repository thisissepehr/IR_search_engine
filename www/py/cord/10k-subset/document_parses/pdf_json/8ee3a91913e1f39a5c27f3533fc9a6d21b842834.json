Influenza causes an acute febrile illness with myalgia, headache, and cough. Although the median duration of the acute illness is 3 days, cough and malaise can persist for weeks. Complications of influenza include otitis media, pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease, and bronchiolitis in children. Additionally, influenza can cause a range of nonrespiratory complications including febrile convulsions, Reye's syndrome, and myocarditis [1] . Clinically, influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses is similar to influenza-like illness (ILI), a syndrome caused by more than 200 known causal agents, mostly with subtypes and serotypes chiefly of viral origin (Table 1) . Two recent studies carried out on 200 university students in Turku, Finland and on 533 elderly people aged 60 to 90 years of age living at home in Leicestershire, England showed the wide range of etiologic agents of ILI (Table 1) [2, 3] . The clinical manifestations of both influenza and ILI can vary in severity from those of an acute respiratory disease with generalized symptoms, to those of a mild common cold. The incidence of influenza and ILI is variable, but most primary care physicians will see around 500 persons with influenza and ILI per 1000 registered population per year. The incidence of ILI is highest in children aged 5 to 10 years [4, 5] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 664, "end": 667, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1132, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1135, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1554, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1557, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 887, "end": 896, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1128, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Since influenza and ILI share most clinical characteristics, an accurate diagnosis of influenza, when possible, would enable effective prevention and treatment, since there are several effective interventions against influenza. Given the mainly self-limiting nature of influenza and ILI, such tests must be rapid and practical to enable their effective use in a primary health care environment. Rapid tests based on polymerase chain reaction have been developed for the diagnosis of influenza viruses. However, a recent unpublished systematic review of the predictive efficacy of rapid tests commissioned by the UK's National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), showed that many studies were based on small population numbers and had been carried out in hospital settings, which are outside the usual diagnostic scenario of influenza, which is primary care. Additionally predictive accuracy is highly sensitive to the level of circulating influenza viruses, which varies yearly and seasonally (A. Burls, Personal communication). The limits of tests and of real-time information on viral circulation available to clinicians mean that differential diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms alone is difficult, except for periods when viral circulation is very high, such as during pandemics. To enable an evidence-based approach to influenza and ILI, this review presents evidence from available Cochrane systematic reviews of the effectiveness and safety of interventions that deal both with specific causal agents and interventions that relieve the symptoms.
