All athymic and euthymic pups (57/57) from immune dams remained clinically normal, whereas 51 of 66 athymic and euthymic pups from non-immune dams died within 30 days. Infectious RV was detected by explant culture in 12 of 15 surviving pups of both genotypes from non-immune dams 30 days after inoculation, but in none of the 57 surviving pups from immune dams. RV-Y DNA was detected by Southern blotting in kidneys of surviving athymic pups from non-immune dams but was not detected in pups from immune dams. Euthymic pups from immune dams appeared not to produce endogenous antibody to RV after virus challenge, whereas euthymic pups from non-immune dams produced high-titered RV immune serum. Pups of both genotypes given immune serum prior to or with RV were fully protected from disease and persistent infection, whereas pups given immune serum 24 hours after RV were partially protected. These studies show that RV antibody offers significant protection against lethal and persistent RV infection.",

            "text": "Rat virus (RV) is a common parvovirus [5] that can cause lethal infection in rat pups [4, 8] , whereas infection of juvenile or adult rats is usually asymptomatic [-2] . Rat pups that survive acute infection can, however, develop asymptomatic, persistent infection [7] . Rat pups born in an enzootically infected colony develop asymptomatic infection as adults [11] . This implies that maternal antibody protects rats from lethal RV infection during their period of maximal susceptibility. Our previous studies showed that antibody-positive dams delivered clinically normal pups that did not develop an RV antibody response after decay of maternally transmitted antibody [6] . This result suggested that the pups were not persistently infected with RV. However, challenge experiments were not done, so it was not clear if passively immunized pups were protected from lethal or persistent RV infection after inoculation of virus. We have recently shown that endogenous immunity to RV begins within 1 week after virus inoculation of non-immune pups, but frequently fails to protect them from persistent infection [4] . To investigate further the role of passive immunity in modulating RV infection, athymic and euthymic rats were challenged with RV before, during or after passive immunization. Athymic rats were included because they are more susceptible to RV-induced disease and persistent infection and do not develop humoral immunity to RV [3] .",

The efficacy of protection was further demonstrated by showing that it applied to both athymic and euthymic pups. Pre-existing or concurrent passive immunity also appeared to protect pups from persistent RV infection, which commonly develops among pups that are not immune at the time of virus inoculation [7] . Spleens and kidneys from passively immunized pups failed to yield infectious virus after explantation and RV DNA was not detected in these tissues. Failure to detect infectious virus or viral DNA does not rule out infection, but makes it unlikely since the kidney and spleen are common sites of RV infection [7] .",

First, protection against lethal or persistent infection was fully effective only if antibody was given before or during viral challenge. Passive immunization as little as 24 hours after virus challenge resulted in persistent infection in about 25 percent of euthymic pups and death in about 15 percent of athymic pups. Second, there was no evidence of a primary humoral immune response to RV among passively immunized euthymic rats. Although the latter result could be explained by interference from passively acquired antibody, the time-dependency of full protection coupled with the lack of active endogenous immunity suggests that antibody prevented infection or eliminated virus rapidly.",

However, virus was not recovered from surviving athymic rats, while 27 percent of their euthymic littermates became persistenly infected, despite the fact that there were no significant differences in antibody titers between the two genotypes or between virus-positive and virus-negative euthymic pups. This result seems paradoxical, but suggests that the timing of antibody acquisition after virus inoculation is critical to the course of infection. Thus, antibody administered early in infection may block the replication and spread of virus in some rats, but not in others. Progressing infection in immunodeficient (athymic) rats would lead to illness or death whereas euthymic rats would enlist i m m u n e defenses capable of aborting lethal infection, but not persistent infection. This scenario suggests that T cell-mediated defenses exclusive of humoral immunity modulate resistance to lethal RV infection. Closer examination of early events during RV infection will help to clarify these issues.",
