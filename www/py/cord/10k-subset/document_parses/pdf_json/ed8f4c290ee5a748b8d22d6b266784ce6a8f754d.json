Smaller amounts of ACE are also found in alveolar macrophages [2] and perhaps fibroblasts [3, 4] . Within endothelial cells, ACE is present in enzyme clusters within caveolae on the plasma membrane that is in contact with the vascular lumen [1] . Decreases in serum levels of ACE can result from diminished production or release of the enzyme by pulmonary cells [4] . Reduced pulmonary microvascular competence, possibly by microaggregates of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) can explain the lower enzyme levels during nonseptic adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or during cardiac surgery [4, 5] . Since the findings of Hollinger et al. [6] , who described elevated ACE levels in lung lavage of rats exposed to thiourea, elevated ACE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid have been used as a specific marker for endothelial cell injury in various animal experimental settings [7, 8] . However the source of soluble ACE in BAL fluid and its use as a marker for lung injury still remains uncertain [9, 10] .",

These differences can be explained by decreased degree of leukosequestration and decreased formation of microaggregates of PMN, by altered neutrophil chemotactic responses, altered neutrophil degranulation and inactivation or possibly by increased release of PMN out of the bone marrow [15, 18] . Confirming other studies, methylprednisolone did not alter complement activation measured by consumption of C3 and C4 or production of C3d [19, 20] . The values of serial serum ACE level determinations during cardiac surgery were not influenced by methylprednisolone. Since it was shown that methylprednisolone did not affect the ACE assay [211, our results show that methylprednisolone administered before ECC did not influence ACE production or ACE release into the peripheral blood. Moreover, concerning the absence of any correlation between absolute values or changes of serum ACE with absolute values or changes of any peripheral blood parameters as are white blood cells and complement factors, or with BAL parameters or with postoperative PaO2/FIO2, serum ACE levels do not predict pulmonary injury during cardiac surgery.",
