            "text": "Electrical stimulation of a single cervical vagus nerve produces neurogenic inflammation on the stimulated side of the bronchial tree, including the first (main) to the 4th order bronchi. In the eontralateral bronchial tree, in contrast, only the proximal part of the main bronchus exhibits inflammatory changes, suggesting that vagal sensory axons present in the bronchi largely originate from the ipsilateral vagus nerve. Intravenous administration of capsaicin can evoke neurogenic inflammation in bilateral bronchial trees. Sensory axons from various sources are thought to be stimulated by this irritant. The extent to which neurogenic inflammation in both bronchial trees might be reduced by unilateral vagotomy is not known. In the present study, we sought to characterize the effect of unilateral cervical vagotomy on capsaicin-induced changes in plasma extravasation and secretory activity of goblet cells in the bronchial trees of both sides. To quantify the magnitude of neurogenic plasma extravasation, Evans blue was used as a tracer dye to measure spectrophotometrically its amount in the bronchial wall. Another tracer dye, Monastral blue, was used to localize the distribution of leaky blood vessels and to measure morphometrically their area density in the whole mounts. To investigate cell and tissue responses of the mucosa, histological methods were employed. After 2 or 4 postoperative weeks, the rats were intravenously administered with a single dose of capsaicin, 150 pg/kg. This resulted in different magnitudes of Evans blue extravasation in the bronchi of the two sides in vagotomized rats. Extravasation of Evans blue dye in the bronchial tree ipsilateral to vagotomy was one-half to two-thirds of that of the contralateral bronchial tree. For the distal region of the main stem bronchus, the area density of Monastral blue-labeled blood vessels in the operated side was one-half of that in the unoperated side, and for the secondary bronchus, the area density of these blood vessels in the operated side was one-quarter of that in the unoperated side. Histological study indicated that in the bronchial mucosa ipsilateral to vagotomy edematous change was not obvious, and most goblet cells were not responsive to stimulation by capsaicin, in contrast to the contralateral side where edematous change was very prominent and goblet cells were very sensitive to capsaicin. It is concluded that unilateral cervical vagotomy could selectively desensitize the mucosa of the ipsilateral bronchial tree to capsaicin, and therefore, decrease the magnitude of neurogenic inflammation.",

After anesthesia with an i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital, vagotomized or unoperated rats received an injection of Evans blue dye (30 mg/kg i.v. over 5 s; Merck) dissolved in 0.85% NaC1. About 20 s later, the rats received an injection of capsaicin (150 gg/kg i.v. over 2-3 min; Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). Ten rats received i.v. injections of Evans blue and vehicle, then 5 rain later the rats were perfused for 2 min with 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 3.5) (Brokaw and McDonald 1988; Huang et al. 1989) . To expose in situ the intrapulmonary secondary bronchi, a toothed forceps was used to tear off the accompanying arteries, veins and nerves, as well as the surrounding parenchymal tissue. The rostral-most four cartilaginous rings were removed from each trachea, fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 75 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.1), and processed for embedding in glycol methacrylate (see histological study below). The bronchial trees and trachea were separated by transecting at their junction. The parenchymal tissue on the intrapulmonary bronchi was further removed by razor blade and forceps under a dissecting microscope (also see the method of Boschetto et al. 1991) . Traces of alveolar tissue and bronchioles remained attached to secondary bronchi, since they could not be completely removed. After they had been pressed with forceps to expel any blood remaining in the tissue, washed with citrate buffer and drained of excess buffer solution, the right main bronchus with four secondary bronchi and the left main bronchus with two secondary bronchi together with the right and left halves of the trachea for each rat were blotted between pieces of absorbent paper and weighed. Evans blue dye was extracted by incubating the tracheal or bronchial tissue in 2 ml of formamide at 50 ~ C in the oven for 16-24 h. The optical density of the extracted dye in formamide, measured with a Hitachi H-1200 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 620 rim, was used to calculate the concentration of dye .",

To localize and quantify morphometrically the mediator-sensitive venules in the bronchial mucosa, Monastral blue was used as tracer to label these blood vessels. Seven Sprague-Dawley rats, that had been pretreated with left vagotomy 4 weeks before, were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital followed by intravenous injections of Monastral blue (30 mg/kg over 5 s; Sigma Chemical Company) and capsaicin (150 ~tg/kg over 2-3 rain) (for five rats), or its vehicle (for two rats) as in the above experiment. Then, after 5 min, the rats were perfused with the fixative phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (McDonald 1988a) . The lungs on both sides together with the extrapulmonary bronchi were removed. Extramural tissues surrounding the extra-and intra-pulmonary bronchi were teased off. The left main bronchus with the medial secondary bronchus (the biggest secondary bronchus of the left lung), and the right main bronchus with the third secondary bronchus (the biggest secondary bronchus of the right lung) lateral to the most medial one, were cut open at the ventral surface. The bronchial whole mounts were prepared according to the method for trachea (McDonald 1988a) . The following morphometric method was modified from that of Huang et al. (1989) . Successive photomicrographs of bronchial mucosal surface were taken along the long axis of bronchi with an Olympus microscope BH 2. Color prints with a magnification of x 40 and area per print of 76 x 127 mm were used for point counting, 3-5 in number for the main bronchus distal region (with 3-5 cartilaginous rings) and 8-10 for the secondary bronchus. The counts were made by superimposing a plastic sheet with a multipurpose test grid (Weibe11979) on the color prints, d = 10 mm and total number of points = 120. The area density of mucosal surface occupied by Monastral blue-labeled blood vessels was determined by dividing the number of points on the labeled vessels by the total number of points of the test grid.",

Monastral blue extravasation evoked by capsaicin was also reduced in the bronchi ipsilateral to vagotomy. Histological study indicated that neurogenic inflammation in the bronchial mucosa ipsilateral to vagotomy was almost prevented. Edematous change was not obvious in the lamina propria, especially in the subepithelial region, and most goblet cells were not responsive. It is suggested that unilateral cervical vagotomy could make the ipsilateral bronchi less reactive, or not reactive at all to capsaicin, while the contralateral bronchi remain reactive to it. Neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, which can induce selective degeneration of chemosensitive primary sensory neurons (Jancso et al. 1977) , causes long-lasting desensitization of the mucosa of whole airways to the irritants . Unilateral cervical vagotomy can abolish a large number of substance P-immunoreactive sensory axons at the base of the mucosal epithelium in the ipsilateral bronchi (Batuk et al. 1992) , and so cause selective desensitization of the mucosa to capsaicin.",

Although unilateral vagotomy can greatly reduce the number of sensory nerve fibers in the tracheal mucosa (Batuk et al. 1992) , the remaining sensory fibers from the contralateral vagus nerve could probably release a sufficient quantity of tachykinins, caused by capsaicin, to produce neurogenic inflammation in the trachea similar to that of intact rats.",

Extravasation of Monastral blue in the bronchial tree ipsilateral to vagotomy was markedly decreased, but Monastral blue-labeled blood vessels were still visible in different parts of bronchial tree, whereas contralateral to vagal electrical stimulation there is no extravasation of tracer beyond the proximal part of the main bronchus (McDonald 1988a). These findings suggest that sensory nerve fibers from both spinal nerves and crossed branches of the contralat-era1 vagus nerve contributed to the occurrence of the lessened vascular permeability in the bronchi of the vagotomized side.",

After a few weeks of respiratory infections with Mycoplasma pulmonis, Sendai virus and coronavirus, the rats develop a thick, columnar, ciliated epithelium with numerous tall, ciliated cells and hyperplasia of goblet cells. A large amount of lymphoid tissue is present in the thickened lamina propria (McDonald 1988b; Huang et al. 1989 ). In addition, the infected rats exhibit an abnormally intense neurogenic inflammation in the airway stimulated by capsaicin (McDonald 1988b . Morphological obervations and the magnitude of neurogenic plasma extravasation suggested that the rats used in the present study had a history of naturally occurring airway infections. It has also been demonstrated that Mycoplasma pulmonis infections are responsible for causing morphological alterations of tracheal mucosal tissue (Schoeb et al. 1985; Schoeb and Lindsey 1987; McDonald et al. 1991) , and long-lasting potentiation of neurogenic inflammation (McDonald et al. 1991) .
