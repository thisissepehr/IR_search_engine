With NAVA the electrical activity of the diaphragm is captured, fed to the ventilator and used to assist the patient's breathing in synchrony and in proportion to the patient's own efforts. Recent clinical trials in adults and term infants showed the feasibility and efficacy of NAVA. Until now clinical data on NAVA in preterm infants are poor and insufficient. In this study we compared currently used ventilation methods to NAVA in preterm infants to evaluate effectiveness and safety of this new ventilation mode on premature babies. Methods: 8 preterm babies with acute RDS needed mechanical ventilation were recruited. The ventilator used was Servoi (Maquet Critical Care). At first babies were ventilated in synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). After 12 h switched on NAVA mode maintained until extubation (15-102 h). At 1-6-12 h of each ventilation mode were analysed arterial blood gases data, expired minute and tidal volume, PIP, MAP, arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ). Ventilator rate (RR mech), patient's spontaneous respiratory rate (RRneu) and, as synchrony index, RR mechanical to neural ratio (MNR = RRmech/RRneu) were calculated. Results: In NAVA PIP levels and MNR resulted significantly reduced than in SIMV mode (p \\ 0.05). Also in NAVA we obtained PaO 2 / FiO 2 higher than SIMV mode (p = 0.059).

It is known that pancreatic secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IB) and proinflammatory cytokines present in meconium challenge the lungs, catabolising surfactant and harming alveoli. Locally produced phospholipases could perpetuate the injury and influence clinical pictures. It is unknown whether pulmonary phospholipases A2 (sPLA2-IIA) and enzyme modulators play a role. Methods: We measured distinct phospholipases A2 and their modulators in broncho-alveolar lavage fluids and in meconium, using specific ELISA/EIA kits. 5 neonates affected by MAS and 5 control neonates matched for gestational age and birth weight were enrolled. Results were corrected for serum-to-BAL urea ratio and dilution factors. Results: MAS patients have a higher amount of pulmonary phospholipase (sPLA2-IIA; p = 0.016) and Clara Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP; p = 0.032). Local lung production of such proteins is confirmed by their low meconial levels and pulmonary production of sPLA2-IIA contributes to the higher total enzyme activity in MAS patients, as compared to controls (p = 0.008). Enzyme total activity and sPLA2-IIA concentrations are correlated with meconial TNFa; increase in phospholipases and TNFa was associated with the release of CCSP in response. Phospholipases activity, sPLA2-IIA and TNFa concentrations in lavage fluids correlate with the degree of oxygenation impairment and of haemorrhagic lung oedema. Cytosolic phospholipase was undetectable both in meconium and in lavage fluids. Conclusions: Pulmonary sPLA2 (and not only the pancreatic isotype) plays a role in the oxygenation impairment and epithelial damage during MAS.

Results: Total of 35 pregnancies had antenatal diagnosis of CDH. Eight pregnancies were terminated. The outcome of 30 live born infants is shown in Figure 1 . Fifteen (50%) of live born infants survived to discharge. The nonsurvivors had an earlier in utero diagnosis of CDH, lower lung-head ratio (LHR) on antenatal scans, lower birth weight and Apgars (Table 1 ). All the ventilatory parameters were significantly worse and the use of inotropes was higher in nonsurvivors. Background and aim: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is considered as a benign and self-limited respiratory disease. A small subset of these neonates progressively increases their oxygen requirement and requires mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of this population-based case-control study was to identify factors associated with subsequent development of ALI among term neonates initially diagnosed with TTN. Methods: Between 2003 and 2008, neonates born in Burgundy between 37 and 41 weeks' gestation and admitted to the neonatal care units within 48 h of life for respiratory distress were screened. Infants with bacterial infection, meconium aspiration syndrome, asphyxia and congenital malformations were excluded. ALI cases were defined as follows: mechanical ventilation [24 h; PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \\300; bilateral alveolar infiltration on chest radiograph and absence of left atrial hypertension. Each case was compared to two controls, randomly selected among neonates with TTN that did not progress to ALI. Results: Sixty-four neonates met the criteria for ALI. Severe complications (pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension, hospitalacquired infection) were encountered in 35 infants. The mortality rate was zero. Three factors were associated with an increased risk for ALI: age at the onset of the disease C60 min; SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at the time of admission to the neonatal care unit B250 and decrease in the SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio during the 5 h following the admission. Conclusion: ALI was an infrequent but severe disease. The SpO 2 / FiO 2 ratio allowed prompt identification of infants at high risk for ALI among neonates initially recognised as TTN.

Material and method: Rat-model ARDS was designed in 10 Wistar albino male rats by intratracheal instillation of physiological saline solution in respect of German and Hafner's study. Anesthetized and tracheotomized rats were pressure-controlled ventilated with 100% oxygen. Rat lung parenchyma lavage was done with 5 9 6 ml of physiological saline solution per animal every half an hour through 210 min.

The British Thoracic Society guidelines state that in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), oxygen saturations below 90% are associated with an increased risk of apparent life threatening events (ALTE) and saturations below 92% may be associated with suboptimal growth. They recommend that, when assessing infants for the suitability of long term oxygen therapy (LTOT), pulse oximetry should be measured for 6-12 h and that oxygen saturations should be maintained at 93% or above. This audit aims to identify national compliance with the BTS guidelines for assessing suitability of LTOT in CLD. Methods: Guidelines for assessment for suitability for LTOT were obtained via telephone survey. Results: Sixty-five randomly selected English NICUs were contacted and 48 responded. 52% carry out pulse oximetry monitoring predischarge in infants with CLD to assess need for LTOT. Of these, target saturations were variable, 8% using 93%, 52% below and 40% above this. Although 43% monitored over the recommended time period, 48% monitored for over 12 and 2% for less than 6 h. Conclusions: Only 4% of units contacted carry out pulse oximetry to assess suitability for LTOT as per BTS guidelines. This suggests that some infants requiring LTOT may not receive this, increasing the risk of ALTE and poor growth. Others may receive unnecessary LTOT, with the associated expense and inconvenience.

Final outcome: 6/12 (50%) babies died in tertiary centre, 1/9 (11%) died in local unit. Conclusion: Most common cause for failure to comply with guidelines were obstetric reasons, but inadequate beds in tertiary centres are an ongoing issue and it is essential that doctors and nurses in these level 2 units keep themselves updated in management of these babies should such a situation arise. Objectives: Pediatricians often have to treat the parents and sometimes, the family, rather than just the child. A major difference between pediatrics and adult medicine is that children are too minors to make decisions for themselves. The issues of guardianship, privacy, legal responsibility and informed consent must always be considered in every pediatric procedure. In present paper we reviewed the literature and try to show the conflict aspects of the medical ethics of pediatrics field in related subjects. Background and aims: Child abuse is referred to all actions that can cause physical, psychological, emotional or social damage (action or omission). The aim of this research was to identify the frequency of child abuse syndrome in a private Hospital. Methods: It is an ambispective, cross-sectional, observational and analytical study, carried out at ''Hospital Betania'', Puebla, Mexico, during the period 2010-2011 (April 30).

Once confirmed, it is obligatory to denounce. Background and aims: To assess practice of withholding and withdrawing hydration and nutrition from neonates in EOL situations. Methods: A 3 months prospective multicenter survey (November 15, 2010 to February 15, 2011) was conducted in 14 Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) from Ile de France. We included all newborns for whom withholding or withdrawing active treatments were discussed. Results: Discussion on withholding or withdrawing active treatments was considered in 54 of 1272 (4.2%) newborns. Active treatments were withheld and withdrawal in 44 cases (all died in NICUs). Ten decisions to continue active treatment were done. Nutrition and hydration were withdrawal or withheld from 14 neonates (31.8%). Other life sustaining treatments were also withdrawal (5 mechanical ventilation, 3 inotropic drugs). Two infants had no chance to survive, 8 ''no purpose situation'', 4 were autonomously breathing, but their quality of life was judged extremely poor. Death occurred 3 days following nutrition/hydration withdrawal. Conclusion: Decisions to withhold or withdrawal life-sustaining treatments from EOL newborns are common. We report the first experience of neonatal withdrawal nutrition and hydration in a French regional study. This practice is controversial, because nutrition and hydration are considered as a basic care. Withdrawal them must be discussed with parents, nurses and other staff before its application, because it will be difficult for parents and nurses to accept. Background and aims: In France, nEOL decision-making procedure is a medical prerogative. Parents are informed, but they don't participate directly to the decision-making process. We assessed changes toward parental involvement in nEOL decision making process 5 years following Leonetti's law. Methods: A 3 months (November 15, 2010 to February 15, 2011) prospective survey conducted in fourteen NICUs in Ile de France. All certified neonatologists (n = 92) participating to nEOL decisionmaking received a 14 items questionnaire. Results: The response rate was 84.7%. Sixty-four (83%) of neonatologists considers nEOL decision-making as medical prerogative and will refuse direct participation of parents if requested. Only 9% of respondents accepted parent's request. During the study period, nEOL decision-making concerned 54 of 1272 neonates (4.2%). Parent's opinion was explored through serial meetings with mean interview duration of 49 min. Fathers attended the interview less often than mothers (10.6% vs. 3.3%) and more frequently refused unreasonable obstinacy (48.8% vs. 37.7%). Mothers tended to not express their opinion (16.4% vs. 8.2%) and to request continuing active treatment (18.8% vs. 9.8%) more frequently than fathers. Most of parents (66.6%) were informed of the medical decision-meeting date, but none participated. Thirty-nine (72%) of parents were immediately informed about the decision. Conclusion: French neonatologists consider that nEOL decisionmaking should be made by doctors. Parent's views were explored through serial meetings. Neonatologists feel they should shoulder the EOL decision responsibility mostly to protect parents against guilt and grief. Background and aims: In 2005, French legislature enacted a law concerning patient's rights at the EOL (Leonetti's law), which prohibits active euthanasia, avoid unreasonable obstinacy in investigations and treatment, authorise withholding and withdrawing useless active treatments and administration of sedatives and analgesics, even at the risk of hastening death. Methods: We questioned the validity of the Leonetti's law in neonatal EOL decision-making. All certified neonatologists participating to end of life decision-making in the fourteen neonatal intensive care units ( Objectives: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that often leads to organ failure or dysfunction. Infused particles may contribute to inflammatory syndromes as they have been shown to induce thrombogenesis, deterioration of microcirculation and modulation of immunoresponse. In a randomized, prospective trial we assessed the effect of particle retentive in-line filtration on reducing major complications in critically ill children (Clinical Trials.gov ID NCT 00209768). Methods: Children admitted to the interdisciplinary paediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital were assigned either to control or interventional group the latter receiving infusion filters (Pall ELD96LLCE/NOE96E, Braun Intrapur Lipid/Intrapur Neonat Lipid) throughout complete infusion therapy. Prior to this study, infusion regiment was optimized to prevent precipitation and incompatibilities of solutions and drugs. One of the primary objectives was a reduction in the incidence of SIRS. Results: 300 children (112 female, 188 male) patients suffered from cardiac disease and most of them (n = 226) were admitted after surgery for congenital heart disease with or without cardiopulmonary bypass.

Methods: By probabilistic sample we realized under prospective, transversal, comparative and analytical design, a study in a group of children with chronic diseases attended in a third care level unit. Groups by gender and type of condition was established, taking blood samples for markers of systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Besides arterial tension, weight and height of patients were registered. Analysis data was parametric. Results: One hundred patients take part, 50 women and same men number, with 7.8 years age average. Metabolic syndrome presented in 16 (16%) patients; 6 (37.50%) women and 10 (62.50%) men, without difference (p [ 0.50). In 66 (66%) cardiovascular risk was high, with difference determined by women (p = 0.01), as well as, in BMI (p = 0.04) and waist (p = 0.02). Oncological patients determined difference in albumin level (p = 0.008) and waist/hip index (p = 0.02).

We must be alert to treat co-morbidity associated with primary conditions. According to the period of manifestation, neonatal GBS infections are divided into early-(EOD) and late-onset disease (LOD). LOD is almost exclusively associated with meningitis, whereas EOD results frequently in septicaemias and pneumonias. We showed that GAPDH is an extracellular virulence factor of GBS that induces host production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) early upon bacterial infection. Here we investigate whether immunity to neonatal GBS infection could be achieved through maternal vaccination against bacterial GAPDH. Before pregnancy, female mice were immunized or not (sham-immunized) with rGAPDH and infected intra-vaginally with GBS in the late gestational period. Pups born from rGAPDH-immunized mothers were protected against GBS infection, even against the highly virulent clone ST-17. In contrast, all pups born from sham-immunized mothers died within 48 h after birth. Severe cases of GBS infections are characterized by a lack of neutrophil recruitment into infected organs. Interestingly, anti-rGAPDH or anti-IL-10R treatment of pups before GBS infection resulted in increased neutrophil numbers and lower bacterial load in infected organs. Therefore, neutralizing antibodies produced in rGAPDH-immunized mothers protect the progeny against lethal GBS infections by blocking IL-10 production and enabling neutrophil recruitment to infected tissues. These results uncover a novel mechanism for GBS virulence in a neonatal host that could be neutralized by vaccination or immunotherapy, preventing both EOD and LOD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the lack of high quality evidence in this area and related ambiguity in national guidance have contributed to diverse local approaches. Observed discrepancies between obstetric and neonatal guidelines may put infants at further risk of infection. A common national or international approach would permit a prospective evaluation of an EOGBS prevention strategy and generate an evidence base which will benefit future guidelines. Results-Conclusions: A positive HBsAg was found in 33 (6.4%) of parturients. 51.5% of newborns were delivered naturally whereas 48.5% were delivered by Cesarean section. 48.5% concerned second partum, 27.3% were first partum and 24% were at least third partum. All neonates of HBsAg positive mothers were immunized immediately after birth with the Hepatitis B vaccine and given human immunoglobulin against Hepatitis B intramuscularly. A significant correlation was found only between the HBsAg presence and nationality as 12.6% of the 33 parturients were Roma, 6.4% were foreign nationals and 5.1% were Greek nationals. It is a known fact that neonates which are exposed to HBV during labour have a 90% probability of becoming chronic carriers. In a recent pan-Hellenic study the percentage of latent Hepatitis B in parturients was 2.2% whereas the respective percentage in our hospital is higher.

Methods: In this prospective observational study in newborns (n = 11), blood withdrawals were studied using near infrared spectrophotometry. Based on concentration changes of cerebral oxyhemoglobin (cO 2 Hb) and deoxyheamoglobin (cHHb) changes in hemoglobin oxygenation index (cHbD=cO 2 Hb-cHHb) and total hemoglobin (ctHb=cO 2 Hb+cHHb) were calculated, reflecting changes in CBF and CBV, respectively.

Conclusions: There were significant differences in evidence of fetal distress and in umbilical arterial pH. All infants were neurologically normal. It is unclear how relevant the intrapartum differences are and while nuchal loops/knots may be associated with adverse outcomes, our study was not sufficiently powered and a larger prospective study is needed. We found the neuro-behavioural scoring easy to administer, and has many applications in the NICU. Discussion: 683 cases were identified (0.2/1000 births). There were 3 cases of persistent neurological morbidity (0.4/1000 births). This small number seems surprising. We know that UCP can induce a total asphyxia. This is compensated for by redistribution of systemic and cerebral blood flow so that the brainstem and basal ganglia are prioritised due to metabolic demand. In total asphyxia, compensation fails, with rapid cell death. This pattern is reflected here, with most infants either intact or suffering brain stem death. Any disability tended to reflect basal ganglia injury. Our study explains the pattern of high mortality in the absence of significant neurological morbidity.

Methods: 27 preterm babies between 26 and 30 weeks of gestational age was investigated for electrical activity during the first 24 h of life with aEEG. The averaged signals were analysed off-line. Background activity was classified into three patterns categories: discontinuous low-voltage pattern (minimal amplitude \\3 lV), discontinuous high voltage pattern (minimal amplitude between 3 and 5 lV) and continuous pattern. Results: Results of 27 babies 5 had discontinuous low-voltage pattern, 22 had discontinuous high voltage and continous pattern. Among the five babies with unfavorable patter 3 showed grade 4 IVH and one multiple subcortical PLV at 40 weeks of postmenstrual age. The other 22 showed normal cerebral USG or minor abnormality. Conclusions: Discontinuous low voltage pattern at aEEG in preterm babies could be expression of severe brain damage and/or altered maturation. The positive predicting value of aEEG for detecting brain damage was 80% in this range of gestational age.

Cases present classically with salt-wasting, vomitingdiarrhoea, dehydration, FTT, adrenal-crisis, arrhythmias, syncope, early demise. Its non-classic-forms presents with normal genitalia at birth/latter precocious-puberty. Cases were prone to severe-bacterialinfections, the attenuated-expressivities were tilted to crises during infective events. Its clinico-patho-radiological-features were more likely to overlap with its differentials (pyloric stenosis, intussuceptions/intestinal-obstructions/FTT.) Methodology: Cases/clinico-auxio-patho-radiological/medical contents of relevance were examined, evaluated/investigated further for features consistent with CAH, against its differentials. Cases: The investigators experience with CAH is epitomized/represented by two cases of compatible-CAH with clinician identified ambiguous-genitalia/ultrasonographically demonstrated ovaries, against its differentials-represented by five cases of radiological/ ultrasonographically/intraopratively demonstrated intussceptions presenting atypically/non-classically with progressive abdominaldistensions/features suggestive of non bloody gastroenteritis (n = 2),in (n = 3)cases with blood-tinged-stools, not in the classically described red currant jelly pattern, in addition to four cases of pyloric stenosis with hypochloraemic-metabolic-acidosis. Although in the compatible CAH cases, inpatient pharmacotherapeutic interventions with inotropic-support, aminophylline, crystalloids/solute replacements sufficed tentatively, for its differentials extramural instrumentations were mandatory. Outcome measures were fair/ spectral, but were most guarded for the intussusceptions subsets. Conclusions/Importance: Since presentations of CAH/its differentials could be quite atypical, given its frequent deleterious consequences, a high index of suspicion will be implied for earlier case identification/apposite interventions. Although features of CAD/its differentials overlap considerable, their distinct emergent/ urgent/ongoing and follow up interventional approaches suggests the need for an exact initial diagnosis. This could be achieved by a higher index of suspicion, an in-depth historic inquiry, a comprehensive clinical evaluation/investigations, especially for the male infant presenting covertly. A transabdomino-pelvic-ultrasonography/basic biochemical evaluations could be adequate to achieve a clinically/therapeutically useful working diagnosis and should be recommended/undertaken at the first instance. Background: Blood lactate at birth as result of activated anaerobic glycolysis is a marker of perinatal asphyxia. Aim: To evaluate the dynamics of blood lactate, pH and base excess (BE) as a tool for assessing the severity of fetal hypoxia and predicting neonatal outcome. Methods: 79 neonates (C34 gestational weeks) were included and followed up until discharge: 43 with pathologic fetal hearth rate patterns and/or 1-minute Apgar score \\7 (''asphyxia group''); 36 without obstetric or clinical signs of asphyxia (control group). Samples from umbilical artery (u.a.), capillary blood at 2 h and 12-24 h after birth were analyzed for blood lactate, pH and BE. Results: Lactate value (u.a.) was significantly higher (5.3 \u00b1 3.4 mmol/l), pH and BE were lower (7.29 \u00b1 0.05 and -14.1 \u00b1 5.9 mmol/l) in the ''asphyxia group'' compared to the control group (2.7 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/l, 7.29 \u00b1 0.05 and -5.9 \u00b1 3.3 respectively). The 2 h lactate-concentration increased significantly in infants with asphyxia (6.7 \u00b1 4.7) compared to the controls (3.2 \u00b1 1.1), the 12-24 h values were reduced in the main group (4.6 \u00b1 1.5) and without changes in the controls ( Objective: Tight glycemic control with insulin has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), especially in (post-) cardiac surgery patients.

The study should clarify how sensitively different oxygen sensors react at different distances from an infrared source. Method: Four different oxygen saturation sensors were tested. The sensors were attached to the index finger of two adult test persons and were exposed to infrared irradiation (Hydrosun 300N, Hydrosun Medizintechnik GmbH).

Background: We recently quantified the extent of ibuprofen on GFR based on aminoglycoside or vancomycin clearance (-18-22%).

This does not merely reflect ibuprofen induced renal dysfunction, but also immaturity (gestational age, weight). In many acute leukemias, normal differentiation does not occur. However, in many cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies, differentiation or apoptosis can be induced by variety of agents. Despite advances in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in most patients long-term survival rates remain unsatisfactory, especially in T-cell derived ALL. Thus we studied the anticancer effects of fenretinide, 1a,25(OH)2D3, and bryostatin-1 in CCRF-CEM (T-cell derived) and Nalm-6 (B-cell derived) ALL cell lines. Using MTT assays, both cell lines were shown to exhibit increased inhibition of proliferation at micro and nanomolar concentrations and induce apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 pathway. Furthermore, for the first time we are reporting consistent anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of Bryostatin-1 in ALL T-cell derived cell line with the lowest ED50. To evaluate the differentiation induction by fenretinide, 1a,25(OH)2D3, and bryostatin-1 in ALL cell lines, we assayed for the expressions of CD19, CD38 markers on Nalm-6 and CD7 marker on CCRF-CEM cell line. The flow cytometric analysis showed a significant increase in expression of CD markers in response to anticancer drug treatments. Overall results demonstrate that the anticancer agents used in this study are strong inhibitors of ALL cell proliferation and inducers of apoptosis and differentiation in vitro. These findings may be quite significant if these drugs are to be used for differentiation therapy of ALL patients in the clinic in the future. Further studies are warranted to establish the in vivo effect of these drugs particularly in patients with T-cell derived ALL. Background: Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are difficult to conduct in neonates, due to the repeated need for blood sampling.

Opportunistic sampling was viewed positively by parents and nurses, as it avoided further pain to the baby and supported minimal handling. Both parents and nurses felt that using minimal blood volumes and opportunistic sampling made it easier for parents to consent, and so helped to facilitate successful recruitment. Background: The use of clinical dashboards in healthcare is not a new concept, but it is one that has not been widely adopted throughout neonatology in the UK Methods: The quality improvement project involved the development and implementation of a dashboard into a neonatal unit of a district general hospital in the UK to record performance against local, regional and national standards.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER PRESENTATION"}, {"text": "Results: The dashboard has played a major role in inducing change within the neonatal unit.

Although there are some elements of concern, the data indicate, due to medical progress achieved, women with HIV can now become pregnant with better prospects. However many of the pregnancies are not planned and many women still find HIV infection in pregnancy and despite antiretroviral treatment planning of the child in the first month of life and subsequent monitoring, these mothers often find it difficult to keep track of the follow-up, especially among foreign women, who have to face additional adversity stemming from economic and isolation hardship. One of the problems that persist in Moldova is that neonatologist involvement is seen as necessary only beginning the time when the child is born. Communication at prenatal stage between obstetricians and neonatologists is less effective, or generally lacking, including when pregnant at risk is already hospitalized. This cause difficulties in anticipation/management of sick newborns. These situations have repercussions both in the health of newborns, as well as staff satisfaction. And subsequent discussions on the evaluation of management errors of intra-and post-natal cases of death are focusing more on ''accusations'', than on constructive critics. Through involvement of obstetricians, neonatologists and midwifes and using Quality Management instruments was developed a clear protocol and algorithm (clinical criteria relevant to perinatal risk, timely period to involve the neonatologists, place of the couple opinion in order to avoid paternalism in medicine).

Nevertheless prevalence of pressure ulcers in general paediatrics in Switzerland is around 28%. In our PICU so far no guidelines for prevention of pressure ulcers exist. No tools for pressure ulcer risk assessment in German are available. These facts led to the presented practice development project. Methods: A literature search for pressure ulcer risk assessment tools and pressure ulcer prevention in PICU patients was performed in Cochrane Library\u00d3, PubMed\u00d3 and Cinahl\u00d3. Articles were reviewed and tested for their applicability in daily clinical routine. Findings from the literature and expert knowledge were the basis for the development of a guideline. Results: Tools for pressure ulcer risk assessment do exist in English but we considered them either too extensive or insufficient for daily use. Admission to PICU alone is a risk factor for pressure ulcers. We decided to set the assessment tool aside and consider all patients admitted to PICU at risk. Based on expert knowledge we created a flow chart as part of the guidelines: Within 6 h after admission inspection of the skin is performed. Based on this assessment preventative measures and the time point for the next skin assessment are planned. Conclusion: Care of PICU patients is getting more complex and prevention of pressure ulcers in these patients is often not of high priority. Therefore it is important that PICU nurses are aware of the risk for developing pressure ulcers and they understand preventative measures. The purpose of the research is establishing acoustical data in 14 infants crying (7 healthy infants and 7 sick infants). Infants' cries with colic and seven healthy infants, male and female, age one to three months were recorded by Zoom HD recorder with built-in stereo microphone, in pediatric ambulance in Zagreb. Results of acoustical cry analyses made by the Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP, Copyright 1990-2000, Kay Elemetrics). Descriptive statistics of acoustical data is obtained by Statistical for Windows, Ver. 5.0. Obtained data showed statistical differences in one parameter: number of unvoiced segments. However, certain differences in obtained data are exists in parameters: fundamental frequencies and degree of sub-harmonics. Infants with colic generally cry in inconsolable manner. Cries of group of infants with colic have less fundamental frequency variation than in group of healthy infants which confirm generally medical fact about monotonous cry in children with colic. Their cries begin suddenly and rise to higher frequencies than glide to the middle of spectra. Their cry in this research is characterized by less voiceless segments and higher degree of sub-harmonics than in healthy infants. This kind of research may help in establishing acoustical data in differing normal than pathological voices in diagnostic purposes. Importance of home mechanical ventilation (HMV) rise from an increase in the number of paediatric patients dependent on long-term mechanical ventilation. HMV is being increasingly employed to treat patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure for any reason. Home ventilation offers the best option for sick children's psychosocial development, social integration and quality of life for whole family. On the other side problems of paediatric home ventilation are its negative psychosocial impact on family life, limited home care resources, the financial burden, and the fact that the equipment is usually designed for adults. Awareness of the possibilities of longterm ventilation is essential in organising discussion of these therapeutic modalities with chronically ill children and their parents. Because institutional care for this group of patient in not possible ouside the PICU in Croatia, from our experience home care is good option for long-term care. After we establish that child, family and their home are ready for many criteria we start to implement the program. At the same time we coordinate with many other professionals, primary doctor on the first place. This present study aimed to examine the characteristics and outcomes of 7 children seen in our department. Our experience showed that HMV can be applied successfully in chronic respiratory failure patients in Croatia. nurse to each patient. The 'nurse case manager' is responsible and accountable for the continuous guidance of a patient from hospital admission to discharge. The implementation of 'nurse case management' on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) resulted in al large variation in operationalization of the concept.

This caused differences in quality and continuity of provided care. The aim of this project was to study the view of the nursing team concerning nurse case management and to develop interventions needed for the case manager model to be effective.

Background and aims: Influenza A (H1N1) virus is a subtype of influenza A. In 2009, it was declared a pandemic by the WHO, and was noted to be a particularly dangerous strain for children. There was a comparatively high number of children admitted with respiratory illnesses over winter 2009-10, although the number of cases of H1N1 was not as high as had been feared.

However, the numbers of recorded interruptions pre intervention were significantly higher -80% than those analysed following the implementation of the high visibility tabards -50%. Conclusions: Our audit demonstrates that interruptions continue to occur irrespective of a change in practice. The audit also demonstrates ''buy in'' by nursing staff, as 100% of nurses complied with wearing the red drug tabards during the medication administration process. However, further exploration is required into the effectiveness of both drug tabard use and investigation into minimising interruptions in the intensive care setting. experiences.

Summary: to raise the motivation for self-learning and eventually to raise the level of knowledge and to improve the treatment quality, a novel instruction method was introduced intended to deepen the knowledge in the simplest way, the way connecting us to our childhood, to the times when learning brought joy, happiness, and the wish to know more. Background: Transport of critically ill, unstable, children off paediatric intensive care (PIC) for urgent head CT is never without risk. A portable CT scanner, the ceretom, was introduced to a regional neuro-critical care lead centre in 2007. We have previously reported the positive impact on patient safety and staffing on the ICU. (1) We aim to describe the development of shared protocols and training for ceretom use. Methods: Descriptive process review.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER PRESENTATION"}, {"text": "Results: Introduction of new equipment to PIC can be challenging, stressful and time consuming. Ceretom initially took significant positioning time to obtain a scan. Evidence was presented repeatedly to all teams of decreased risk of adverse patient events and a robust ceretom user group was developed (radiology, PIC consultant, senior nursing staff) which facilitated creation of shared protocols and risk assessments. Initially separate PIC and radiology team education developed into regular joint scenario training, which now provides practical guidance to all about their role in the provision of a scan. Following this the average time for scan is now 20 min, though the radiographer only needs be present for the actual 5 min scanning time and medical staff are not required. This compares to 1-2 Drs and 2 nurses being off PIC for up to 1 h for standard scans. Conclusion: CT scans on critically-ill children who are either too unstable to transfer to CT scan, or in whom the level of dependency, e.g. CVVH/ECMO, precludes transfer can now receive safe bedside head CT scans without leaving the PICU. Conclusion: There is an emerging need to develop educational materials for expecting parents regarding the safety, utility and benefits of providing VK for newborns in order to ensure that parents make an informed decision following the birth of their child. Objective: The purpose is to find the actual situations of parenting for children with combined vascular malformations. Combined vascular malformation is very rare and congenital diseases, and almost incurable. In Japan, this disease develops at the rate of 1/2,000,000 and the cause of this disease remains unknown, and thus treatment is still under development. Methods: Subjects were 2 fathers and 3 mothers with children who had combined vascular malformations. We interviewed them about their parenting. For ethical considerations, we explained about the purpose and methods of this study using written papers and obtained their consents. Results: We found 8 categories on the fathers' parenting and 10 categories on the mothers' parenting. Fathers' 8 categories are 'Confusion by a notice of the disease', 'The life style together with the disease', 'Support of children's independence and relieving children's pain', 'The role of the family', 'Request for teachers' cooperation in the school', 'Expectation for nurses' roles', 'Expectation for medical doctor' and 'The request of social welfare'.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-POSTER PRESENTATION"}, {"text": "Mothers' 10 categories are 'Efforts to visit the hospital regularly', 'Home training for accepting disease', 'Support of children's independence and relieving children's pain', 'Increasing anxiety about children's future', 'Actual feeling of an advantage for being in hospital', 'Anxiety about human relationships in the hospital', 'the roles in the family', 'Request for teachers' cooperation in the school', 'Expectation for Nurses' roles' and 'The request of social welfare'. Conclusion: In general, fathers were watching over the children, while mothers were aiming at well discipline for them. Objective: Mothers with handicapped children become to possess a feeling of difficulty to take care of them at home as they grow up. The aim of our research is to clarify the mothers' worries for the training of their handicapped children at home. Methods: The subjects were 454 mothers with handicapped children. We distributed them questionnaires and extracted the replies regarding worries for home training. Then we analyzed them by qualitative descriptive method. Results: We obtained replies from 303 mothers. The response rate was 66.7%. Handicaps of their children included mental retardation (31%), autism (24%), physically handicap (13%), epilepsy (11%), Methods: Patients were eligible for this prospective observational study if they had received continuous infusion of benzodiazepines and/or opioids for more than 5 days. When doses were being tapered off, patients were repeatedly screened for withdrawal symptoms. Nurses used both the SOS and the Numeric Rating Scale-withdrawal, allowing to determine the cutoff score for the SOS. Sensitivity to change was determined by comparing SOS assessments per patient before and after additional administration of sedatives or opioids to reduce withdrawal symptoms based on a validated algorithm.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-ORAL PRESENTATION"}, {"text": "Results: A total of 2506 paired SOS and NRS-withdrawal assessments were obtained in 118 children (median age 5.5 months; IQR 0-47 months). The median number of assessment per child was 13 (IQR 6-29) assessments over a median of 5 days (IQR 3-10). A cutoff score of 4 or higher for the SOS; resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.91, respectively, as calculated against a NRSwithdrawal score of 4 or higher. The sensitivity to change was good, as the mean SOS score dropped from 5.9 (SD 1.9) before intervention to 3.4 (SD 2.5) after intervention (p \\ 0.0001). Background: As more preterm-born children receive life-saving care and survive, more parents live through the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit experience. There has been a large body of research examining the experiences of mothers of preterm-born children, while studies focused exclusively on fathers are sparse, although increasing. Few studies focus on the years after the child's birth.

Findings: The fathers' lived experience was described as a process towards a reorganization in life and they described a journey from past to present time. They had lived through the experience of having a preterm-born child and had adapted to living an ordinary family life. They were now able to believe in a future for the family as a whole.

An increased understanding of their experiences can guide professionals to include fathers' specific needs in the care during and after the hospitalization to a greater extent. Can information and communication technology (ICT) be used as way to support parents of preterm born children after discharge from the neonatal unit? This question was raised when the Neonatal nursing care at home by ICT (NeOHIT) project started. The aim of this presentation is to introduce the NeOHIT project and share some methodological perspectives on the research. The aim is also to present experiences of planning and implementing this ICT project as well as present some of the findings. It was found to be crucial to develop a number of different options of collaboration between the University and the hospital staff and also with the parents. Ethical considerations are of great importance and needed to be considered throughout the whole research process. The importance of developing collaboration between the researchers and the neonatal nurses during the implementation of this ICT research project was found to be of utmost importance. Findings shows that the use of ICT from both parental and staff perspective are supportive and facilitate the communication. This was highly valued by participants living in an area with long distance between the hospital and the families' homes.

Aims: Determine whether there is a need to study the clinimetric properties and diagnostic quality of the COMFORTneo-scale when used during therapeutic hypothermia after perinatal asphyxia. Method: A quantitative pilot-study with a retrospective cohort was used. Data were collected from the status of 99 neonates with a gestational age C36 weeks. Neonates were divided into three groups: asphyxiated with therapeutic hypothermia (AH), asphyxiated (A) and reference group (R).

A statistical significant difference was seen between the three groups at first measurement (p = 0.013), the third (p = 0.014), fifth (p = 0.026), sixth (p = 0.012) and ninth measurement (p = 0.035). Mean COMFORTneo scores over the total period of the individual neonates showed no significant differences between groups. Multivariate analysis to correct for the influence of medications and respiratory support on the COMFORTneo score was not possible due to the fact that the assumptions to perform such an analysis were not met. Conclusion: No firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the validity and reliability of the COMFORTneo-scale as a measurement of stress and comfort in asphyxiated neonates with therapeutic hypothermia. A new cut-off point for stress and comfort as measured with the COMFORTneo-scale for these neonates seems necessary. Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate the burn-out level of NICU nurses and how it affects their quality of life.

Background: Since 2004 the heart surgery intensive care unit of the Zurich University Children's hospital has been offering an ECMO therapy for heart and lung failure. Due to the steady increase of cases, and also due to transfers from external hospitals for ECMO therapies, more nursing professionals are needed. In the past, our ECMO specialists were all trained in London (GOSH). Methods: The ECMO specialist team of the heart surgery intensive care unit has developed an ECMO training program in cooperation with the physicians and the cardio technicians of the Zurich University Children's hospital. The training program was established according to the current ELSO guidelines. The training is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical base of the ECMO therapy is taught to the participants in a three-day course, and a first practical handling is rehearsed.

Methods: Prior to the start of chemotherapy a blood sample was taken from 75 patients with childhood leukemia and MBL serum concentration was measured using a commercially ELISA kit. Results: Twenty patients had concentrations under 1000 lg/L, defining MBL deficiency and the remaining 55 patients had concentrations [1000 lg/L. Ten patients suffered from more than one episode of severe infection. Sixty-five percent of patients with MBL below 1,000 lg/mL suffered from 2 or more episodes of infections (3 of 16 individuals with 1 severe infection; 10 of 16 with 2 and 3 of 16 with 3), in contrast to only 29 of 55 (52%) patients with MBL above 1,000 lg/mL (19 of 27 individuals with 1 severe infection and 10 of 27 with 2).

Cases with CMV-related pneumonia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia are published. Case: A female preterm infant (GA 24+2 weeks, birth weight 570 g) developed at the age of 2 months a symptomatic postnatal CMV-infection (congenital CMV-infection was excluded by negative CMV-culture from urine in the first week of live) with thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and persistent demand of additional oxygen. CMV was isolated from blood-, urine-and throat-samples. Antiviral therapy with Valganciclovir (VGCV) was commenced, CMV-related symptoms improved and the viral load in the blood and urine became negative. Unfortunately, the preterm developed a leucopenia due to VGCV. Accordingly, VGCV-therapy was stopped, which was followed by a secondary raise in CMV-viral load. At that time the infant produced CMV-IgM-and marginal CMV-IgG-antibodies. Both became negative 6 weeks after onset of the postnatal CMV-Infection. Hence CMV-HIG therapy, 6 9 100 IU/ kg within 16 days, was initiated. The therapy was well tolerated. CMV-viral load in urine remained positive and was low (\\ 200 copies/ml) in blood. The clinical status of the patient improved. Three weeks after CMV-HIG therapy the patient was discharged with a normal full blood cell count and without supplemental oxygen.

Methods: Prospective, open-label, multicenter, noncomparative, Phase III clinical trial, preterm infants were treated with Ped3CB-A for 5-10 consecutive days. Results: 34 (BW: 1571 \u00b1 514 g; GA: 31.3 \u00b1 2.6 wks; PNA: 2.2 \u00b1 0.8 d) were included as soon as informed parental consent was obtained. Mean duration of Ped3CB-A represented 8.4 \u00b1 2.0 d accounting for 281 perfusion days. Lipid bag was not activated in 5 infants accounting for 15 d of perfusion (5.3%) mainly due to the increase of oral intakes. Hypertriglyceridemia [250 mg/dl were reported in 2 patients. Mean and maximum parenteral protein and energy intakes/kg day in PN represented respectively 2.6 and 3.3 g AA, and 71.5 and 90 kcal. Combined with enteral nutrition, mean protein and energy intakes represented 3.4 g AA and 108 kcal/ kg day. Use of insulin to reduce hyperglycemia and promote AA and energy intake was limited to 3 infants and 10 days of perfusion. Biological parameters remained in the normal range for preterm infants. Minimal adjustment of electrolyte and mineral supplies were provided by direct adjunction to the Ped3CB-A or by Y-route. Mean weight gain was 10.0 \u00b1 9.5 g/kg day.

Many of the delays in neonatal resuscitation are related to very simple factors that close the neonatal airway such as poor head positioning, and either pushing on the face mask too hard or not recognising a poor seal around the mask. Our hypothesis was that that use of the Igel LMA would reduce the time taken to secure the neonatal airway in novices.

Design, setting and participants: We approached 104 parents of children in PICU of Ain Shams University. Face to face interview questionnaire was used in two situations; first at admission in the PICU to identify their priorities of care and second after discharge to assess their level of satisfaction with care. Results: Response rate was 91.3% in first situation and 81% in second situation. The majority of responders thought most aspects of care as important. The most important priorities were related to professional attitude domain (mean = 4.82), care and cure, and information domains (mean = 4.70) while organization domain (mean = 4.36). Regarding parents 0 satisfaction, ''care and cure'' was the dimension showing the highest satisfaction score, (mean = 4.16, SD = 0.62), followed by professional attitude (mean = 4.15, SD = 0.56); while parental participation and information had the lowest level of satisfaction (Mean = 2.58 and 2.29).

The aim of our study was to determine whether using NIV in District General Hospital setting can reduce PICU admissions. Transfusion of packed RBC improves sublingual microcirculation as indicated by an increased functional vessel density. This improvement is not sustained in children with infection, probably due to the impact of infection per se on microcirculation.Conclusion: Polycythemia leads to disturbed microcirculatory blood flow in the skin of infants and does not significantly improve despite decreased hematocrit in the first days of life. In opposite, FVD decreases significantly, possible due to the fluid challenge which might actually lead to an increase in microcirculatory perturbation.

Herrera 1 , A.M. Trevino 2 , G.C. Acosta 1 , R.M. L\u00f3pez 1 Intensive Care Unit, Mexican Social Security Institute, Sonora, Background and aims: Congenital cardiac diseases are the most common form of pediatric malformation. Then in development countries in last decade early diagnosis and treatment increase the surgery procedures. This study orientated towards global trends morbidity characterization in a patient's series go to repair cardiac anatomic alteration. Methods: We carry out an ambispective study with patients treated in a school-hospital in Mexico, during three consecutive years by congenital cardiac anatomical disease. Files review in variables as: gender, age, type of cardiopathy, time of cardiopulmonary derivation, Trans-surgical urinary expense was 3.94 ml/ kg/h, in children with 17.99 kg average weight. Statistical difference was founded in urea and creatinine levels (p = 0.000) after arrived to PCIU and 24 h later. Hourly urinary flow was low down in a significant way (p = 0.000) after 24 h PICU stay. Patients with cyanotic disease presented major renal dysfunction (p = 0.002). Methods: 174 paediatric cardiac patients were analyzed postoperatively in PICU at the Royal Brompton Hospital. Continuous monitoring was used and possible risk factors such as age, weight, birth weight, gestational age, ethnicity, prior surgeries, RACHS score, use of CPB, CPB time and ACC time were compared.

Aims: To assess disease pattern of group A streptococcal infection. To assess treatment and outcomes. Methods: Retrospective audit.All  culture positives for group A streptococcos in 2008 & 2009 identified and analysed. Total number of cases-98. Results: Most Common presenting symptom was fever, followed by sore throat and vomiting. 90/98 had positive throat swab cultures. 5 had positive blood cultures. At least half of the children presented with fever of 38-39 degrees. 46% had enlarged tonsils, 54% had exudates. 6 had invasive streptococcal infection, of which there was one death. Conclusion: The successful investigation and management of every case of GAS is important for preventing possible serious infections. PERSISTING INCREASED TNF-ALPHA-SECRETION BUT NO BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION IS DETECTABLE IN A PORCINE MODEL OF 18-HOURS-LASTING IAH FOLLOWED BY DECOMPRESSION T. Kaussen 1 , M. Afify 2 , R. Tolba 2 , A. Schachtrupp 3 Neonatology and Pediatric Intensive Care, Kinderklinik Dritter Orden Passau, Passau, 2 Laboratory Animal Sciences, 3 Surgery, University hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, GermanyObjectives: Surgical decompression is gold standard of treatment in cases of established ACS. Even after opening-up the abdomen the mortality remains as high as 50%. One possible explanation might be bacterial translocation from IAH-derived ischemic gut as well as the release of inflammatory mediators as a result of ischemia and/or reperfusion. There is still lack of knowledge, at what duration of IAH/ ACS a ''point-of-no-return'' might be exceeded, after which patients suffering from IAH/ACS possibly stop profiting from any therapy. Against this background, this study aimed to clarify whether decompression after 18-hours-lasting IAH promotes bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Methods: 18 pigs were divided into 3 groups, analog sedated, ventilated and monitored for 24 h. IAD was increased to 30 mmHg for 18 h (Reperfusion-group) and 24 h (IAH-24-group). In controls: IAP unchanged. Hemodynamics and PIP were recorded continuously. Additional volume was given whenever CO fell below control values. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-10 and TNFa were detected 3-hourly. Central-and portal venous blood samples and MLN were taken intravital. After killing further specimen were taken from lungs and MLN for histopathological and microbiological examination. Damage was classified semiquantitative. Statistics: ANOVA + Mann-Whitney-U (p \\ 0.05). Results: Edema and granulocytic cell infiltrations most often were seen in lungs and lymph nodes of study-pigs. Microabscesses only were found in the Reperfusion-group. TNFa increased in both IAHgroups and remained elevated even after decompression. Conclusions: 18 h of IAH followed by reperfusion were sufficient to induce immunological activation. This implies that decompression should be performed as soon as possible whenever IAH remains or promotes.NICU, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, 2 National Blood Service, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK, 3 Pathology and Paediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, 4 NICU, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA Background: Frozen Plasma (FP) and cryoprecipitate (Cryo) are frequently transfused to neonates although indications remain unclear. This survey aimed to characterize current UK neonatal FFP/Cryo transfusion practices. Methods: 15 question survey developed by neonatologists and transfusion medicine specialists. Including clinical scenarios and direct questions about FP/Cryo transfusion decisions. Pre-piloted survey was posted to all UK neonatal units (n = 200). Results: Response rate was 53% (105/200), 42% level 2, 25% level 3 and 12% level 1 units. Overall, neonatologists would consider FP/ Cryo transfusions for broad indications. 48% of clinicians, would consider using FP for volume expansion in a non-bleeding, noncoagulopathic infant with hypotension refractory to inotropes and crystalloids. In a clinical vignette describing the same case scenario, 11% of clinicians would use FP to raise oncotic pressure. 19% of neonatologists would use FP as an adjunct to diuresis in an infant with oedema, when other interventions failed whereas in a clinical vignette describing this scenario, 5% of clinicians would order FP. For isolated abnormal haemostatic test results in the absence of bleeding, 21% of clinicians would give FP (irrespective of laboratory results), while 66% would order FP for clinical bleeding in the absence of coagulation results. FP dosage practice (51%: 10 mls/kg, 43%: 15-20 mls/kg. 26% of respondents did not use Cryo. Conclusions: Neonatologists would consider using FP to expand volume and raise oncotic pressure in neonates. FP dosage practice varies amongst units. There was limited consideration of Cryo for transfusion. This survey highlights several areas where more evidence and education are needed to improve practice.Background: Neonates admitted to NICU often have thrombocytopenia and up to two-thirds receive platelet transfusions. Functional activity of donor platelets (largely genetically controlled) may exert an effect on the increment after a platelet concentrate (PC) transfusion. We analysed the increments achieved in neonates receiving PCs from donors representing the tail-ends of the distribution for platelet functional responsiveness. Methods: Setting: tertiary NICU. Two year retrospective case review of neonates receiving hyper and hypo responsive platelet transfusions. Platelet counts were recorded pre, at 24 and 72 h post transfusion. Results: Overall group: median birth weight: 855 (IQR: 726-1142) g. Median gestational age: 27 (IQR: 25-32) weeks. 12 neonates were administered 16 PCs; 10 neonates had sepsis/NEC; two were transfused following a major IVH. Conclusions: This is the first suggestive evidence that platelet increments after PC transfusion may differ between neonates transfused with hypo-or hyper-responsive donor platelets probably due to a more rapid clearance. A larger study is required to confirm the hypothesis that platelet function may be an independent contributing factor to the frequency of PC transfusions and neonatal outcomes.SEROEPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF BRUCELLOSIS INHIGH RISK GROUP IN BOYERAHMAD 2010 A. Khosravani 1 , B. Sharifi 2 , S.M.A. Mansoorian 2 Microbiology & Immunology, 2 School of Medicine, Yasouj University of Medical Sciences, Yasouj, IranObjective: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that may have a major public health and economic impact in most countries which is appear as a malt fever in humans and abortion in animals. This study was designed to determine the serologic titer of Brucella in high risk and non high risk people in Boyerahmad. Method: A retrospective seroepidemiological study on samples collected at 604 high risk and non high risk people using Rose Bengal test, tube standard test as a rapid test and 2 mercaptoethanol (2ME) and comb's wright as a confirmatory test. Result: Seroprevalence of Brucellosis in high risk people appears to be high in the Rose Bengal and tube standard test (TST) 6.62 at titer C1/40 whereas for non high risk was 0%. Confirmation test in high risk people were shown with 2ME in four people. The data collected were analysed by v 2 test via SPSS. Conclusion: Brucellosis is a major cause of disease in high risk people which related to direct or indirect contact with diary products related animals.137 -POSTER PRESENTATION ETIOLOGY OF BACTERIAL SEPSIS IN PRE-TERM NEWBORN INFANTSE. LekicUniversity Clinical Center Montenegro, Institute for Children Diseases, Podgorica, Montenegro Background and aim: Infections cause significant mortality and long term morbidity in neonates, especially for premature. Newborn infant have quantitatively and qualitatively ''impaired'' immunologic system and are less capable of responding to infections. Maternal, environmental, and host factors determine which infant exposed to a potentially pathogenic organism will develop serious or other potentially invasive infections. The purpose in this retrospective study was to identifications the bacterial microorganisms caused neonatal sepsis and/or meningitis in pre term newborns hospitalized in the Center ofNeonatology, during the period of 2002, 2003 and 2004. Method: We used clinical, microbiological, laboratory and radiology methods. Results: 682 pre-term (PNB) were treated at the Center of Neonatology in Podgorica during the period 2002-2004. In 98 PNB with proven infections (omphalitis, cutaneous infections, conjunctivitis, infection tracti urinary, pneumonia, diarrhea), 30 PTB were diagnosed and treated for sepsis and/or meningitis (30.6%). Dominant pathogens responsible for sepsis and/or meningitis were: Staphylococcus aureus (26.6%), Staphylococcus Co negative (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumonia (20.0%),Serratia marcescens (13.3%) then with equally frequency SGA, Acinetobacter (3.3%). Meningitis were proven in 7 PNB or 23.3% per cent. Conclusions: Dominant bacterial microorganisms caused neonatal sepsis in preterm newborn infants in our region and during this period were Gram-positive Staphylococcus spp., and from Gram negative group Klebsiella pneumonia. There are significant regional differences in pathogens of neonatal infections. It is important to identifications the bacterial microorganisms, analysis of longitudinal trends assist in the formulations of strategies to treat and prevent neonatal serious infections.Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading agent of neonatal infections.

In critically ill patients, these pathogens can overcome the host defenses. Aim of the study: To determine the pattern of colonization acquisition of multi-drug resistant bacteria among critically ill children during their PICU stay. Study design: A prospective study from March 2009 to September 2009 in PICU of Ain Shams University. Methods: Fifty patients were screened for bacterial colonization; immediately after their admission to PICU (initial colonization), then 3 days later (acquired colonization). Four sites were examined; oropharynx, axillary folds, perianal area, and urine. Samples were cultured on Blood agar, Mannitol salt agar for MRSA and on Aesculin bile agar for VRE. Results: Thirty per cent of patients were initially colonized (15/50). Community colonization by MRSA and VRE is alarming. The significant increase in colonization and infection by multidrug resistant bacteria in the PICU emphasize the hostile hospital environment that necessitate adherence to basic infection control policies and better antibiotic strategies.140 -POSTER PRESENTATION EARLY ONSET GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS SEPSIS: GUIDELINES REVIEW A.

A number of risk factors for early onset GBS sepsis (EOGBS) have been described and the presence of these provides an opportunity for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). This is the basis of current UK national guidelines for intrapartum and postnatal management. A previous study showed poor compliance with national guidelines among cases of EOGBS, suggesting missed opportunities for prevention. Therefore, we conducted a review of neonatal unit EOGBS guidelines. Methods: All 18 units within the UK Neonatal Infection Surveillance Network (NeonIN) were invited to contribute and 14 guidelines were offered for review. Results: All guidelines were written or updated since 2003 and cited references to the evidence-base, including national guidelines. Within this network of units with a declared interest in infection we found substantial inconsistency within and between their recommendations. They varied both on use of IAP and in the targeting of risk factors as indications for enhanced investigation or treatment of asymptomatic newborns. All units recommended treatment of symptomatic infants with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF40": {"text": "NYSTATIN VS FLUCONAZOLE AS NEONATAL ANTIFUNGAL PROPHYLAXIS.

Hospital, 2 Pediatrics, Maternity and Children Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaBackground: Candida is the 3rd causal agent of late onset sepsis in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates, estimated incidence of 1.6 to 9% and mortality of 30 to 75%. Fluconazole has shown to be effective in reducing infection in VLBW neonates, we would like to test the hypothesis that nystatin is as effective. Method: By using SPSS software to generate random numbers, 37 infants were assigned 19 babies on Fluconazole (6 mg/kg q72 hourr for 1st week then q48 h for 6 weeks) and 18 on Nystatin (100,000 unit q8 hourr for 6 weeks). Risk factors such as broad spectrum antibiotics, T.P.N, H2 blocker, central line and corticosteroids. Side effects, efficacy and cost of each medication recorded.Results: Our interim analysis, no differences in birth weights 1.Fluconazole (28.22) or risk factors. Rectal swab colonization occurred in 2/18 (11.1%) and none in the Fluconazole group, no systemic candidacies. 3/19 (15.78%) had transaminase elevation 1 standard deviation above the mean in the Fluconazole group. The cost of the Fluconazole 106.4 US/pt, the cost of Nystatin 50 US/pt. Conclusion: Intravenous Fluconazole and oral Nystatin at the recommended doses are equally effective in preventing systemic Candida infection in preterm infants, no side effects were observed, however, oral Nystatin is readily available, with half the cost per infant and easily administered.

Stampar School of Public Health, Medical School University of Zagreb, 4 University Children's Hospital Zagreb, CHC ''Sestre Milosrdnice'', 5 University Hospital for Infectious Diseases ,,Dr. Fran Mihaljevic\u00b4'', Zagreb, Croatia Background: The epidemic pattern of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Croatia is biennial. In order to determine if the circulation of different RSV subtypes affect the outbreak cycle, the paper analyses the epidemic pattern of RSV in children in Croatia (Zagreb region) over a period of 3 consecutive years. Methods: RSV was identified in the nasopharyngeal secretions of 700 Zagreb inpatients, aged 0-5 years, who were hospitalised with acute respiratory tract infections over the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008, using direct virology methods. The virus subtype was determined by real-time PCR. Results: Of 700 RSV infections identified in children, subtype A virus caused 374 infections, and subtype B 318. Four patients had a dual RSV infection (subtypes A and B). The period of study was characterized by 4 epidemic waves of RSV infections-one, smaller, in the spring of 2006, the second, larger, in December 2006/January 2007, the third in spring 2008 followed by a fourth outbreak beginning in November of 2008. Bronchiolitis or pneumonia occurred in 210 of 374 (56.15%) subjects with proved infections caused by subtype A. Subtype B infection caused bronchiolitis or pneumonia in 184 of 318 cases (57.86%, p = 0.65) of documented infection caused by this subtype. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that, over a 3-year period of observation, the biennial RSV cycle in Croatia cannot be explained by a difference in the predominant circulating serotype of RSV. Other unknown factors account for the biennial cycle of RSV epidemics in Croatia. 143 -POSTER PRESENTATION GROUP NON SPECIFIC RED CELL TRANSFUSIONS IN PRETERM INFANTS AND NECROTISING ENTEROCOLITIS C. Morgan 1 , M. Culliton 2 , R. Mc Carthy 1 , E. Molloy 1,3 Neonatology, 2 Haematology & Transfusion, National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, 3 Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Dublin, IrelandIntroduction: Transfusion related gut injury (TRAGI) has been suggested as a possible mechanism in necrotising enterocolitis. RBC alloantibody formation in infants of less than 4 months of age is considered to be extremely rare therefore all neonates receive group O blood irrespective of their own blood group. Aim: Assess the association between the development of NEC and red cell transfusions that are not group specific. Methods: A retrospective study which looked at confirmed cases of NEC from 2006 to 2010 with Bells staging [2 and those patients who developed NEC after receiving a red cell transfusion for any reason. All neonates received 20 ml/kg of red cell concentrate irrespective of aetiology of anaemia. All infants received either O positive or O negative red cells irrespective of their own blood group. Therefore all neonates with group A, B, or AB did not receive patient group specific red cells. Results: Of 779 transfusions, 47% of neonates were transfused with the same blood group compared with 48.8% of neonates who developed NEC (n = 49 infants). 39 of the 49 patients with NEC had received a red cell transfusion before they developed NEC. There was a similar percent of each blood group in infants who did and did not develop NEC, although there was an increased number of positive types who developed NEC (46 versus 37%). Conclusion: There was no increased incidence in the development of NEC following a non group specific red cell transfusion. However, more detailed research investigating TRAGI in these infants are warranted.Objectives: To examine the prevalence of Hepatitis B carriers in parturients (Greek and foreign nationals) that gave birth at General Hospital of Corinth in 2010 and its correlation with demographic factors. Materials-methods: 519 serum samples were examined that were obtained from parturients either during their scheduled pre-partum visits or on the day of parturition. 118 (22.7%) women were Greek nationals, 95 (18.3%) were Roma and 306 (58.9%) were foreign nationals.

At 1 week of age he developed urinary retention requiring suprapubic catheterization. Urine cultures confirmed Candida albicans. He was initially treated with intravenous Flucanazole followed by oral fluconazole with no response. The renal ultrasound revealed non-obstructive unilateral fungal balls (fig). Subsequent treatment with Micafungin for 2 weeks led to clinical improvement and resolution of the fungal balls. Conclusion: Micafungin is an echinocandin-class antifungal agent licensed for treatment of invasive disease in adults. The optimal dosing regimens for infants are not established yet. There are studies confirming the safety and efficacy of Micafungin in preterm infants with hepatitis as the most common side effect reported. We are reporting the case of fungal septicaemia with renal fungal balls which responded to Micafungin monotherapy with no complications and obviated the need for surgical intervention. We preferred Micafungin over amphotericin B because of potential risk of adverse effects with the latter in sick preterm with known renal problems.

We have examined how H1N1 influenza affected children admitted to paediatric intensive care. Methods: Cases were identified to the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) by Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) in Great Britain and Ireland. Diagnostic information was reviewed by a consultant paediatric intensivist (PL). Demographic details and outcomes are reported. Effects on mortality were investigated using logistic regression models, adjusting for predicted mortality using Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM 2). Results: There were 295 admissions of 282 children, 52% boys and 16% south Asian. Median age at first admission was 57 months. The first admissions were in June 2009 peaking in October 2009 (n = 86). 46 children died (16.3%), higher than predicted by PIM2. Mortality was higher among girls and south Asians (risk adjusted odds ratios for death: girls 2.36; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.2-4.7, p = 0.015; south Asians 2.3; 1.05-5.0 p = 0.037). Children who died were older (median 106 months). Median length of stay was 6 days. Invasive ventilation was used in 67% of admissions (median 6 days), inotropic support in 31%.6, and renal support in 4%; 6 children required ECMO. Conclusion: The H1N1 pandemic was more limited in numbers than had been feared. However, the disease carried a high mortality, especially in older children, girls and south Asians.148 -POSTER FOR ORAL PRESENTATION ANDPOSTER PRESENTATION CONCOMITANT BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA IN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV) BRONCHIOLITIS M. Pavcnik-Arnol, M. Groselj-Grenc, M. Derganc Department for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia Background and aims: Diagnosis of concurrent bacterial pneumonia in children with severe bronchiolitis requiring assisted ventilation is difficult. The aim of pilot study was to compare diagnostic accuracy of different methods for diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in children with severe RSV bronchiolitis. Methods: 17 children with severe RSV infection admitted to tertiary PICU were classified into group 1 (n = 6)-bronchiolitis with bacterial pneumonia and group 2 (n = 11)-bronchiolitis without bacterial pneumonia. On admission (day 1) and after 48 h (day 3) quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates and blood for determination of neutrophil CD64 index (CD64in), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), PCT and CRP were taken. The diagnostic accuracy of markers was expressed as the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was based on consensus criteria proposed by Langley and Bradley. Results: Groups 1 and 2 were similar regarding CRP and PCT. Quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates and CD64in have high diagnostic accuracy for concomitant bacterial pneumonia in children with severe RSV bronchiolitis. The results of quantitative cultures and LBP on day 3 could help optimize antibiotic therapy. 149 -POSTER PRESENTATION RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS AND CONCOMITANT BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA IN CHILDREN IN RESPIRATORY FAILURE M.

We aimed to investigate the role of TF +5466A [G (rs3917643) polymorphism in the association of air pollution on serum levels of TF as a biomarker of vascular injury in children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 110 children, consisting of 58 (52.8%) girls and 52 (47.2%) boys with a mean age of 12.7 \u00b1 2.3 years, living in Isfahan, Iran. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for measurement of serum TF. Genotype of +5466A [G (rs3917643) polymorphism was determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Findings: We identified 2 individuals with +5466AG genotype and 108 homozygous for the +5466A allele (no +5466GG homozygotes). The mean pollution standards index (PSI) value was at moderate level, the mean particular matter measuring up to 10 lm (PM 10 ) was more than twice the normal level. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that after adjustment for confounding factors, i.e. weight status, dietary and physical activity pattern, serum TF level had significant relationship with PSI (beta: 0.55, SE: 0.07, p \\ 0.000) and PM 10 (beta: 0.51, SE: 0.03, p = 0.001). Conclusion: In spite of similar genetic polymorphism of TF, air pollutants might have an independent association with systemic inflammatory and coagulation responses. The harmful effects of air pollutants on the first stages of atherosclerosis in the pediatric age group should be underscored in primordial and primary prevention of chronic diseases.151 -POSTERPRESENTATION STUDY ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HELICOBACTER PYLORI AND INFANTILE HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC STENOSIS M.

This study performed to evaluate the possible relationship between IHPS and H. pylori. Methods: In a case-control study, 20 infants with definite diagnosis of IHPS and thirty otherwise healthy sex and agematched infants who were intended to go under a circumcision were recruited as the control counterparts. Serum antibody against H. pylori (IgG) was measured in infants and their mothers. Likewise, stool H. pylori antigen was also evaluated by ELISA in the infants. Results: Twenty infants with IHPS, with a mean age of 42.40 \u00b1 19.09 (25-90) days and 30 controls were enrolled. In the case group, 18.2% of the infants were H. pylori + comparing with 23.1% of the controls (p = 1). All the mothers of the case group were H. pylori + comparing with 95.8% of the mothers in the control group (p = 1). Simultaneous infection of HP, 18.2% of the mothers and infants of the case group were H. pylori + comparing with 33.3% of the mothers and infants in the control group (p = 0.617). The mean titer of infant serum HP antibody was comparable between the two groups (14.21 \u00b1 8.18 ng/dl vs. 11.80 \u00b1 19.07 ng/dl in the case and control groups, respectively; p = 0.342). Mean stool antigen was significantly higher in the case infants (1.74 \u00b1 4.59 ng/dl vs. 0.62 \u00b1 0.44 ng/dl; p = 0.020). Conclusion: According to our results, there might be a connection between HP infection and IHPS in infants; however, controlled studies with larger sample size are required.152 -POSTER PRESENTATIONDETERMINATION OF THE BEST CUT OFF POINT FOR ELISA IN HUMAN BRUCELLOSIS A. Sanaei, A. Karimi, V. Javadi, F. Shiva, F. Fallah, G. Angoti, Z. Pournasiri Pediatric Infection Research Center, Shahid Beheshti Univ. M.C., Tehran, IranIntroduction and aims: Brucellosis is a worldwide disease that due to its diverse clinical manifestations needs to be proved by laboratory data. Serum agglutination test (SAT) is the most widely used test for diagnosing brucellosis. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can determine specific antibody classes against brucella; it is a sensitive, simple and rapid test, which could be an acceptable alternative to SAT, with fewer limitations but like any other new test, should be further evaluated and standardized according to the local situations and population. This study was planned to compare the diagnostic ability of ELISA with SAT and determine an optimal cutoff point for ELISA. Materials and methods: Four hundred and seven consecutive patients which fever and other compatible symptoms of brucellosis, were enrolled in the study. Serum agglutination test and ELISA were performed on their sera. Results and conclusion: The cut-off point of 53 IU/ml of ELISA-IgG yielded the maximal sensitivity plus specificity comparing to the other levels of ELISA-IgG and was considered as the best cut off-point of ELISA-IgG to diagnose acute brucellosis. At this cut-off, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood and negative likelihood ratio were 84.RECOMBINANT HUMAN GRANULOCYTE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR IN PRETERM NEONATES WITH SEPSIS AND NEUTROPENIA J.E. S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez, M.G. Espinosa, E. Salguero Neonatology, Hospital Carlos Haya, Ma\u00b4laga, SpainBackground: Systemic sepsis is a major cause of death in preterm infants. Neonates are at high risk for developing bacterial infections due to quantitative and qualitative insufficiencies of innate immunity, particularly granulocyte lineage development and response to infection. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor stimulate proliferation and maturation of myeloid precursors in the bone marrow and modulate functions of mature neutrophils. Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) in correcting neutropenia induced by sepsis. Methods: Retrospective study that includes all newborns with sepsis and neutropenia (\\1000 neutrophils/mm 3 ) admitted in our NICU from September 2009 to October 2010. Results: 9 babies were enrolled. 66% female. Mean birth weight and gestational age (GA) 969 g and 29 + 3, respectively. Apgar score was [7 in most patients (78%). Risk factors for neutropenia included: prematurity (100%), antenatal steroids (55%), pre-eclamptic mother (45%) and intrauterine growth restriction (23%). 4 patients presented with neutropenia at first day of life, 3 developed at second day and 2 at third. RG-CSF (10 mcg/kg daily, 2 days) were administered intravenous in all cases because of clinical and laboratory findings compatibles with early onset sepsis. All patients initiated empirical antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin. Neutrophil counts after rG-CSF administration rose significantly with an average of 54 h. There were no adverse reactions attributable to rG-CSF. No thrombocytopenia and anemia were detected. Three patients had proven sepsis with positive blood cultures to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter. 7 patients had resolution of neutropenia and survived the septic episodes. Conclusions: According with data available in literature, our patients had a quicker recovery of their total of neutrophils without serious adverse effects. Further studies are needed to assess whether the administration of G-CSF may modify the long-term.154 -POSTER PRESENTATION SCHISTOSOMIASIS AS A CAUSE OF TERMINAL HAEMATURIA IN A 14 YEAR OLD BOY IN UNITED KINGDOMA.

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 12-step program to prevent antimicrobial resistance was launched educating clinicians about antimicrobial resistance and providing strategies to improve clinical practice. Methods: Prospective, 3 months surveillance of antibiotic use on our paediatric intensive care unit (phase 1) and evaluation according to the 12-step campaign with development of attainable interventions. Second 3 months surveillance phase after implementation of the intervention with comparison of antibiotic use. Results: Antibiotic use[48 h for culture-negative infections (step 10) and target the pathogen for proven infections (step 4) were the two main areas with possible improvement. The intervention was a mandatory form requesting indication, likelihood of infection at start of antibiotic therapy, review after 48 h and 5 days questioning possible stop of antibiotic therapy, reasons for continuation and possible target pathogen. Phase 1 had 174 admissions (952 hospitalisation days) with 12 proven and 53 culture-negative infections. Phase 2 had 185 admissions (1186 hospitalisation days) with 24 proven and 57 culture-negative infections. The percentage of antibiotic therapy for culture-negative infections \\3 days increased from 18% (10/53) to 35% (20/57; p = 0.05) and correct targeting of pathogen increased from 58% (7/12) to 83% (20/24; p = 0.11). Conclusions: Antibiotic surveillance using the 12-step campaign is a possible way to evaluate institutional antibiotic therapy. Development of attainable interventions are possible and can show improved antibiotic use with minimal expense.156 -POSTER PRESENTATION NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS IN PRETERM INFANTS AND MODE OF DELIVERY L. Strueby 1 , M. Briggs 2 , L. Givelichian 1Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between the mode of delivery and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants. We hypothesize that caesarean section would place preterm neonates at increased risk of NEC. Methods: Ethics approval was obtained for this single center retrospective cohort study. Maternal and infant charts were reviewed on infants born between 2001 and 2007 at less than or equal to 28 weeks gestation. Out born infants were excluded. Antenatal, intrapartum and neonatal data were extracted from the medical records. NEC was diagnosed based on clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings. Chi-square with Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables and the Student's T-test was used for continuous variables. Results: 63 infants were included with an average gestational age of 25.7 \u00b1 1.3 weeks and an average birth weight of 856 \u00b1 166 g. A total of 29 infants were delivered by caesarean section and 34 infants were delivered vaginally. Of the 11 infants that developed NEC 4 were delivered by caesarean section and 7 were delivered vaginally which was not statistically significant (p = 0.526). Maternal and neonatal factors, such as preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, maternal antibiotic use, medical or surgical ductal closure, the use of steroids, early feeds, or prolonged use of inotropes, were not significantly associated with the development of NEC. Conclusion: Based on this study, delivery of preterm infants less than 28 weeks by caesarean section does not increase the risk of developing NEC.157 -POSTER PRESENTATIONCYTOKINE GENE EXPRESSION OF TH1 AND TH2 LYMPHOCYTES IN ALLERGIC AND NON-ALLERGIC PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYP BY PCR METHOD A.D. Tabatabaei, M. Farhadi, S. Noorbakhsh, S. Javadi Nia, ENT, Children Infectious Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IranAims: Several researches performed to study the probable roles of different predisposing etiologic mechanism's in nasal polyposis including the immunopathologic. Conditions: In order to elucidate the probable participation of Th1, Th2 lymphocytes in duction and progression of nasal polyposis this study designed. To differentiate Th1, Th2 cytokine gene expression in excised polyp tissues 75 patient's with polyps with mean age of 38 (18-81 years) selected, with and with out allergies in according clinical laboratory evaluations total serum IgE and allergen specific IgE measured by commercial immunoassay and allergic skin test performed for disease diagnosis and to determinate the allergic background a cytokine (&Imf/hl-4) gene expression done on extracted RNA using RT-PCR.Results: Frequency of & IFN and IL-4 gene expression was statistically significant in allergic versus non allergic patients (39.5% vs. 14.2%, p = 0.3, 44.7% vs. 18.9% p = 0.02, respectively). The IL-10, IL-12 (p35, p40) genes do not differ significantly in two groups. Discussions and conclusion: The data of present study is more or less compatible with the finding of Bernsteu and Kirstsdihal concluding that both Th1, Th2 genes expressed in nasal polyps I allergic patients and no cellular polarization is detected o The role of Th2 infiltrating in allergic inflammation of upper respiratory tracts and allergic rhinitis is not implied in polyps with or with out allergies on nasal polyps could considered as special in inflammatory reaction with several cellular involvements.Microbiology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, TurkeyCarbapenem-resistant strains of Acinetobacter is an important problem in hospitals including newborn wards and treatment choices are limited. Elucidation of clinical risk factors are important for prevention of these infections. We evaluated the frequency, associated factors and prognosis of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections in our tertiary care newborn unit between the years 2004 and 2009. Clinical records of 56 newborns (34 term, 22 preterm) with Acinetobacter spp. infections have been evaluated. 78.6% of newborns had co-morbidities such as RDS, LBW, meconium aspiration syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, congenital heart disease or other congenital anomalies. 87.5% of them required intensive care and 83.9% of them were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Isolates were obtained from tracheal aspirate (28), urine (13), blood (14), and CSF (1). Carbapenem-resistance have been determined in 37.5% of all Acinetobacter isolates. We have observed no association between presence of carbapenem resistance and intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation, TPN, urinary or central line catheterization and other co-morbid clinical conditions. Acinetobacter infections were 2.7 times more common in preterm than term newborns (OR 2.7; 1.0-6.9, p = 0.016). Among patients with ventilator associated pneumonia (n = 28), carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter infections were related with prematurity (OR 3.23; 0.86-12; p = 0.04) and presence of surgical interventions mainly pleural tap (OR 3.55; 0.96-13, p = 0.02). In this 6 year period 5260 newborns were hospitalized and NICU mortality was 4.6%. 53.6% of newborns with Acinetobacter infection died (n = 30) which was the 12% of all cause deaths during 6 year period. We observed no difference about the prognosis of newborns with and without infected with carbapenem resistant isolates.Suppurative salivary gland diseases are rare in neonates.

We will describe a case about a 9 year-old boy, who underwent He was delivered to the Emergency Department giving signs of end-stage pulmonary function related to hypercapnic status [PaCO 2 120 mmHg]. At that moment he already was on the waiting list. Considering his clinical status, we eventually decided to support him with veno-venous ECMO. The peculiarity was the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation carried out with a helmet CPAP during veno-venous ECMO support for 10 days when an organ donor became available and the redo transplantation was performed. Spontaneous ventilation was intentionally maintained in order to decrease the already established pulmonary damage inherited from the previous lung transplantation. We believe that the advantages of this technique include: 1] a better heart-lung interaction (avoiding a raise in the thoracic pressure typically related to the conventional mechanical ventilation), 2] a decreased risk of barotrauma, 3] decreased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 4] a conscious sedation and avoidance of neuromuscular blocking drugs.Disadvantages include: 1] management of psychological support owing to the disease 2] lack of childtailored device for noninvasive ventilation (i.e. pediatric helmet for CPAP), 3] technical issues related to nurse management of ECMO vascular accesses and ventilatory support devices, 4] management of bleeding in conscious patient.

M. Cordeiro, M. Cabrera, E. Escribano, L. S\u00e1nchez, P. L\u00f3pez-Ortego, J. P\u00e9rez, J. Quero Neonatology, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, SpainBackground and aims: The gap between organ supply and demand is growing every year. The aim of this study is to determine wether neonates could be an infant organ donor population by identifying potential non-heart beating organ donation candidates in a level III NICU. Methods: Retrospective study of all deaths after withdrawal of life support in neonates of C37 weeks of gestational age between 2000 and 2010. Exclusion criteria for potential candidates were developed by neonatologists and transplantation surgeons. Results: During the study period 85 deaths occurred of which 75 were excluded (7 had a weight at death \\2500 g, 34 didn't require mechanical ventilation at the time of withdrawal of life support, 4 had sepsis, 1 had encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, 23 had severe hemodynamic instability, 6 didn't have suitable organs for donation). Of the remaining 10 possible candidates, 7 had a time of warm ischemia less than 2 h and were potential donors of 5 hearts, 12 kidneys, 6 livers and 7 bowels. Conclusions: Although the number of possible candidates is low (8.2%), neonatal non-heart beating organ donation should be considered. Infants in the waiting list for bowel transplants would benefit the most, since most of them are under 1 year of age with a low weight and, the shortage of donors and the mortality rate among them are rising. However, before implementing any transplantation policy, ethical issues about neonatal organ donation should be well discussed so as to avoid conflicts between palliative care and organ recovery.RISK FACTORS FOR MORTALITY IN BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS IN PICU: INVASIVE VENTILATION REVISITED L. Murphy 1 , M. Gray 1,2 St George's, University of London, 2 PICU, St George's Hospital, London, UK Introduction: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients have a high mortality when admitted to PICU. Mortality is higher in BMT patients with respiratory failure. A retrospective review of BMT patients admitted to PICU was conducted with the objective of identifying factors that might differentiate survivors. Methods: A search of a PICU database was conducted over a 5 year period. Reason for admission, pre-BMT conditioning, ventilator settings, ventilator days and outcome were collated. The peak Oxygenation Index (OI) was calculated for each of the first 3 days of invasive ventilation. Results: 44 BMT patients were captured amounting to 59 admissions between 2004 and 2009. 19 of these admissions were intubated. The mortality in intubated patients was 36.8% All self-ventilating patients survived. None survived [4 days of invasive ventilation or advanced ventilation. The peak ventilator days was 43.Patients who receive total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy prior to their BMT have a higher mortality than those with chemotherapy alone. Those who received allogeneic BMT had a higher mortality rate than those who received autologous transplants. Mean OI on days 1-3 of invasive ventilation was lower (4.79) in survivors compared to nonsurvivors (30.73), this was statistically significant (p = 0.00076). Conclusion: The mortality associated with intubated BMT patients is lower then previously reported. Risk factors for mortality in BMT patients admitted to PICU are; invasive ventilation for [4 days, TBI, allogeneic BMT and advanced respiratory support. OI may be a useful adjunct to clinical decision making in this patient group.''LOOK WHO'S TALKING'': HOW WELL ARE WE COMMUNICATING WITH PARENTS IN THE NEONATAL UNIT? A PATIENT SURVEY S. Dewlett, T. Polychronakis, G.Y.T. Ng NICU, Imperial College, London, UK Background: Emphasis on communication skills in medicine is increasing. Parental anxiety on the neonatal unit (NICU) is high. Good communication by health care professionals can improve parents' experience at a difficult time. Objectives: To assess parental attitudes to communication in NICU and identify areas of weakness.Methods: A structured questionnaire using Likert scales and free text regarding different statements about communication with members of the multidisciplinary team in a tertiary level unit. Confidential questionnaires were posted and handed to parents over a 3 month period at discharge and outpatient visits.Results: 17/19 (89%) returned anonymous questionnaires in clinic and on discharge. 8/40 (20%) returned the posted questionnaire. Of the 25 respondents: 72% completely agreed that they were satisfied with updates; 50% with adequate frequency of updates; 65% that doctors content was adequate; 80% felt comfortable asking questions. 60% felt that they were updated by the most appropriate member of the team; 85% completely agreed with the statement that ''doctors spoke in a way that I could understand''. 28% completely agreed and 33% somewhat agreed that written information was given to back up discussions. 35% expressed a wish for prearranged updates. Some parents raised concerns that conversations occurred by the cotside where others could listen.Conclusions: Overall satisfaction about communication in NICU is high but our study identified a need for more frequent updates; privacy; written information; psychologist support and addressing of spiritual needs. Training and guidelines should focus on these aspects of communication.PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSISTANCE DECREASED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION AMONGST PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS STUDENTS IN POST-WAR BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA M.I.

Subjects and Methods: The stratified sample of 336 students, aged of 13.6 \u00b1 1.9, in primary and secondary schools, involved in psychosocial support, compared with 72 randomly selected peers from the same schools, not involved in this project. Data were collected in December 2005 and in May 2006. The Children Depression Inventory and Index of Children Post-traumatic Reactions were utilized. Statistical analysis involved McNemar's test, Students' t test, Chi-square test and Pearsons' correlation test.Results: According to DSM, the prevalence of PTSD and depression among students involved in the School Project, significantly reduced from (46.1 to 13.4%; 25.6 to 1.8%, respectively) (McNemar's test, P \\ 0.001; P \\ 0.001, respectively). In the control group the prevalence of PTSP and depression reduced from (30.5 to 23.6%; 22.2 to 11.1%, respectively), with no significancy (McNemar's test, P = 0.332; P = 0.077, significantly). Girls had significantly higher prevalence of both PTSD and depression compared to the boys. Age, number of traumatic episodes, and suicidal behavior correlated with the intensity of PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms. Conclusions: Psychosocial support within the School Project resulted with significant reduction of PTSP and depression amongst involved students compared to controls.

In the last decades the complexity of intravenous drug therapy increased. As a consequence, the correct administration of drugs and fluids is a challenging duty for the staff. Recent clinical trials showed that up to 46% of the treatment errors on intensive care units were related to infusion therapy. Aim: To develop an infusion-management workshop for physicians, nurses and pharmacists to create an interdisciplinary forum to learn about all features of infusion therapy. Concept: Based on three interactive hands-on modules and different presentations giving background information and data about recent clinical trials, this course should enable participants to optimize their own infusion regimen and therefore improve patient's safety.Module 1: Compatibility in the Catheter: introduction of a computer program for the detection of incompatibilities with practical training and presentation of typical incompatibility reactions. Module 2: Vascular access: presentation of different central venous catheter types, technique of venous access under sterile conditions, ultrasound and Doppler for venous access, training of intraosseous access with drill and needle, Module 3: Hardware in Infusion therapy: technical specifications of equipment, handling of in-line Filters to prevent particle infusion, working on complex patient's scenarios. Results and conclusion: 18 courses with more than 400 participants indicate the broad acceptance of the new course concept. Post course evaluation reveals a high rate of contentment. The assessment of the evaluation questionnaire underlined the necessity for standards in infusion therapy to increase patient's safety. 303 -POSTER PRESENTATION DO I KNOW THE PATH AHEAD?

Questionnaires were sent to neonatal units across the UK. Method of data collection: Answers from questionnaires. Results: Received 108 questionnaires of which 88 (81%) were from district general and 20 (19%) from tertiary hospitals. 70 (65%) units surveyed had unit guidelines, 37 (34%) did not and in 1 (1%) there was no reply. Follow up in majority, 59 (50%) occurred at 6 weeks, second follow-up varied with the majority 43 (40%) were followed up between 3-6 months. Subsequently follow up was at 6 months 32 (29%) and 12 months 38 (35%). Majority 76(70%) were discharged at 2 years of age. 107 (99%) of these clinics were consultant led and over 76 (70%) had follow up with other teams which included physiotherapy 46(42.5%) and occupational therapy 55 (50.9%). An assessment tool was used in 82 (75.9%), Bailey 22 (20%), Griffiths 26 (24%). These assessments were performed by consultants/doctors 68 (63%) and community team in 20 (19%) cases at varying periods of time between 1 and 2 years of age. Conclusion: The absence of national guidelines in the follow up of neonates at risk. Clear evidence that problems identified and supported early have an impact on the long term development. Recommendation: National guideline on follow up of neonates at risk.COMPLIANCE OF PRE-OPERATIVE PRACTICE WITH NICE GUIDELINES: A PROSPECTIVE CASE ADJUSTED AUDITF. Khan 1 , A. Alosta 1 , A. Akbar 2 , L. Jenkison 2 Urology, Kettering General Hospital, Kettering, 2 NHS, Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, UK Introduction: Preoperative care of the surgical patients has a major impact on the surgical outcome and is an essential part of a good surgical practice. The aim of the preoperative care is to improve surgical outcome by identifying medical disorders and any other difficulties and, if feasible modify risk factors that might adversely influence the results. The aim of this audit is to measure the compliance of the Trust with NICE recommendations. Patients and methods: It's a prospective audit. All patients undergoing preoperative assessment in preoperative admission clinic in 1 month were included. Access database and patients notes were used to collect data. Total of 780 tests were carried out. Standards were selected from 'Current Surgical Guidelines' published by NICE in 2003. Results: The total number of tests carried out in accordance with the guidelines was 384 (49.2%).The total number of tests not carried out in accordance with the guidelines was 229 (29.4%).The total number of tests inappropriately carried out when patients did not meet the preop criteria was 89 (11.4%). Therefore the appropriateness of preoperative tests in compliance with the NICE guidelines was 59%. Conclusion: We suggest teaching sessions for junior doctors as well as for nursing staff, responsible for the preoperative assessment clinics. We also suggest regular auditing of our practice to improve our practice.DNA DETECTION OF PERIODONTAL PATHOGENS IN THE SALIVA OF NEWBORNS, SIX-MONTH AND TWELVE-MONTH-OLD INFANTS J. Dort 1 , M. Stromeck\u00e1 1,2 , V. Merglov\u00e1 1 Department of Neonatology, University Hospital, 2 University Hospital in Pilsen, Pilsen, Czech RepublicBackground and aims: Improved genetic diagnostic methods suggest that acquisition of pathogens associated with periodontal diseases occurs earlier than previously appreciated. The presence of these microbes can represent a risk factor for early onset periodontal diseases. The aim of the study was to identify the main known periodontal pathogens in the saliva of newborns and infants. Methods: 34 three day old healthy newborns, 58 six month old healthy predentate infants and 45 twelve month old healthy infants were randomly selected into study. Before examination of infants, parents gave written consensus. Unstimulated saliva samples from dorsal mucosa of tongue and alveolar mucosa were collected with sterile swab and used for detection of the most important periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia). Bacterial species were identified using PCR based method (test StomaGene \u00d2 , Czech Republic). Results: The periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) were found in saliva of 2.9% newborns, 63.8% six-month-old predentate infants and of 95.6% twelve-month-old infants. Conclusions: The periodontal pathogens are rarely detected in newborns' saliva, but they can occur in oral cavity of predentate sixmonth-old infants. The presence of periodontal microbes in oral cavity of twelve-month-old infants was common finding in our study.Supported by Grant IGA Health Ministry of Czech Republic NS/ 9732-4.

Schibler 1 PICU, Mater Children's Hospital, 2 School of Nursing & Midwifery, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, 3 Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, AustraliaObjectives: Lung recruitment in mechanically ventilated paediatrics is proposed as a means to minimise Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We conducted a RCT with a crossover design to determine the effect of manipulating PEEP on End Expiratory Lung Volume (EELV). Methodology: Sixty intubated and mechanically ventilated paediatrics were studied. Two methods of manipulating PEEP were tested after endotracheal suctioning. The first method was a double baseline PEEP manoeuvre for 2 min and the second method was incremental (4 cmH 2 O) increases up to 18 cmH 2 O and decremental decreases back to baseline PEEP. The impact on EELV was assessed using EIT. EIT measures changes in regional ventilation distribution. Oxygenation was assessed by arterial blood gases. Oxygen delivery was calculated non-invasively, using the USCOM.Results: There was a significant increase in EELV post the double PEEP manoeuvre (p = 0.05). Oxygenation as expressed by the P/F ratio also improved. For those children with 'healthy lungs' oxygenation improved from 377.33(129.39) to 412.57(101.34) p = 0.37 following the double PEEP manoeuvre. For those children with Acute Lung Injury (ALI) oxygenation improved significantly from 221.42(46.47) to 239.94(63.84) p = 0.014. In children with baseline p/f ratios of\\200 oxygenation improved significantly (p = 0.04) only with incremental changes in PEEP. Conclusion: The double PEEP manoeuvre improved both oxygenation and EELV compared to the control group in all children. Incremental changes in PEEP are more beneficial in terms of oxygenation in those children with ARDS. NON INVASIVE VENTILATION IN INFANTS WITH A NASOPHARYNGEAL TUBE W. Tan, C. Dominguez, M. Navarro, G. Nicol\u00e1s, M. Pons PICU, Hospital Sant Joan de De\u00b4u, Esplugues de Llobregat, SpainIntroduction: The use of interfaces in paediatrics to administer noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in infants less than 6 months is limited due to the lack of sizes . Objectives: Describe the efficacy of the nasopharyngeal tube (NT) as an interface for NIV in infants less than 6 months. Methods: A prospective study was carried out with patients younger than 6 months who received NIV using the NT between January 2005 and December 2010.Variables analysed were: disease, type of NIV, type of ventilator and mode, length of NIV and efficacy. Nursing protocol: NT placement (7 cm) inside the nares and nursing care is described. Results: There were 166 patients studied. Elective NIV was initiated in 74 patients (44%), rescue postextubation NIV in 17 patients (11%) and elective postextubation NIV in 75 patients (45%). NIV was used more often in patients affected by Bronchiolitis, 95 patients (57%). Servo-i was used in 89% of patients, Giulia 7% and BiPAP Vision 4%. NIV modes employed were A/C P 74%, PS 18%, S/T 8%. Mean time in NIV was 61 \u00b1 54 h (76 h success versus 26 h failure) p \\ 0.0001. The efficacy in patients treated with Bilevel modes using the NT was 74%. Except for tube obstruction, no other complications associated with the use of this interface were observed. Conclusions: The NT is an effective interface and a viable alternative in infants less than 6 months. Keeping the NT patent is fundamental for the efficacy of NIV.IMPACT OF GIVING OXYGEN TECHNIQUE ON ENDOTRACHEAL SUCTION TO HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES AT CARDIAC SURGERY PATIENT IN PICU HARAPAN KITA INDONESIAB.F.

When a child death occurs in a pediatric critical care ward (emergency room or intensive care), the behavior is even more complex because of the impact of provided resuscitation support and the high complexity of nurse care. Methods: To collect and analyse the reactions following a child death within the pediatric critical care nursing staff, a questionnaire was distributed in three large hospitals in Northern Italy: a total of 71 questionnaires correctly filled in were collected (versus 75 distributed). Results: The survey target covered nurses from a pediatric emergency department in 67.6% (n = 48) of cases and pediatric intensive care units in 32.4% (n = 23), 52 females (78%) and 15 males (22%) with an average age of 38 years (mean = 38.4 years) and an average of 15 year work experience (mean = 14.2 years).Nurses reported contact with a child death in 73.2% of cases; death cases are more common in the pediatric intensive care units (80.0% of respondents) than in pediatric emergency rooms (69.9% of respondents).The survey also revealed a strong training need for more than 80% of respondents and a general lack of any psychological support service to be activated for mourning re-elaboration. Conclusion: Nurse training and psychological support are perceived as essential for better management of death in children in critical setting.315 -POSTER FOR ORAL PRESENTATION ANDPOSTER PRESENTATION ACTING BUNDLE FOR ACHIEVING BETTER COMPLIANCE WITH HAND HYGIENE N. Azar, R. Barashi, E. Sadot Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, IsraelObjectives: Compliance with hand hygiene (HH) is widely recognized as the most important factor in preventing transmission of infection to patients in health care settings. It is well known that in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) settings, HH compliance is lower due to increased patient-health care provider interactions, understaffing and overcrowding 1 . Our goal was to measure the impact of a promotion program on HH practice and its effect on nosocomial infection rate in a multidisciplinary Pediatric ICU over 1 year period. Methods: The acting bundle included: on-line educational software and assessment, presentation of the program in staff meetings, controlling the accessibility and availability of alcohol based hand rub at patient's bedside, appointing a daily hygiene agent within the staff and performing daily surveillance with instantaneous feedback. The compliance rate was calculated by dividing the number of cases adhering with HH before and after an interaction by the total number of interaction opportunities. Results: Compliance with HH improved from 9.5 to 70.5% 11 months after the bundle implementation. Nurses' compliance was 73% and physicians' compliance was 68%. The rate of nosocomial infection decreased from 2.7 to 1.3 episodes per 100 patient admissions during the study year. Conclusions: Persistent and designated intervention policy and staff involvement with responsibility sharing are keys to increase compliance of health care workers for HH with a resulting in a successful reduction of nosocomial infection rate.INSULIN THERAPY IN CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN WITH BRAIN DAMAGE M.M. van de Polder, S.B.

One part of this study examined practices around gastric residual volumes (GRV). Methods: Phase I involved a local survey in one PICU and Phase II involved a cross sectional e-survey (survey monkey) to all PICUs listed in the PICANET database (Winter 2010) Results: 108 responses from 27 different PICUs across the UK and Ireland, making the overall PICU response rate 90%. The volumes used to identify an 'acceptable' level of gastric aspirate varied markedly among respondents ranging from 3 (47%)-10 ml/kg (11%) for a 5 kg infant. The majority expressed the acceptable level in this age group as percentage of feed given, and this ranged from [25 to [70% of the feed back. Looking at the technical and patient factors that could potentially affect the GRV, clinicians identified some, but not all the factors, the main factor identified was the position of the feeding tube. 19% of staff said high GRVs would make them stop feeds; however 'acceptable' GRV was the top reason (74%) that staff used to determine feed tolerance.Conclusions: It is clear there is no consensus and no evidence about what is an acceptable level of GRV in critically ill children. Future research should focus on what are acceptable GRVs for different ages and what method is best to quantify a GRV. Practice implications are further nurse and medical education about factors affecting GRV. 319 -POSTER PRESENTATION A SURVEY UK AND IRISH PICU PROFESSIONALS' KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES OF ENTERAL FEEDING IN CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN L.

Methods: Phase I involved a local survey in one PICU (Alder Hey) to pilot and refine the survey (July 2010), Phase II involved a cross sectional e-survey (survey monkey) to all PICUs listed in the PIC-ANET database (Winter 2010). Results: 108 responses from 27 different PICUs across the UK and Ireland, making the overall PICU response rate 90%. Respondents demonstrated a good mix of the PICU team with: 26% medical staff, 13% dieticians and 61% nursing staff. Most staff (70%) believed that on average children in PICU got less than 60% of their prescribed calorie intake with the top 3 reasons cited as fluid restriction, nurses too slow in starting feeds and frequent fasting for procedures. 76% of respondents said their units had written guidelines for EF, with 85% of clinicians stating they believed these helped improve calorie delivery. The vast majority of units did not have a target time to start EF. The main reason for stopping feeds was the suspicion of NEC, with high gastric aspirates (GA) ranking next. Fasting for 13 common interventions varied both in which procedures children were fasted for and the length of fasting times. There were no significant differences between the three professional groups.Conclusions: There remain large variations in practice surrounding EF in critically ill children in the UK and Ireland. NATIONAL SURVEY OF TRANSPORT TEAM INVOLVEMENT IN PALLIATIVE CARE IN THE UK L. Crabtree, C. Harrison, S. Hands, A. Wolfendens Embrace Transport Service, Barnsley, UKBackground: Embrace, the first UK combined transport team has received over 3000 referrals and carried out over 2000 transfers in our first year. Palliative care is an area of growing interest and there are now dedicated Childrens hospices around the UK. Embrace transfer to home or to a local hospice for palliative care and have a dedicated group looking at Palliative care and pathways for transport. Aims: UK transport services were contacted to ascertain pathways for moving infants/children with palliative care needs.\u2022 To establish if transport services carried out these requests \u2022 Numbers \u2022 Respiratory support \u2022 Destination \u2022 Other team involvement \u2022 Presence of guidelines/pathways.Results: 14 teams were contacted and replied-10 Neonatal teams, 4 Paediatric. 3/14 transported to home, 6/14 to hospice but only 2/6 would only move non-ventilated patients to the hospice The number carried out per year is difficult to establish -most teams had not carried out any but said they would do if asked. Other teams said these were ''rare'' requests. 1 team reported 2 transfers. 2 other teams had community involvement prior to transfer and 1 team was working with a hospice to develop their service. No teams had guidelines although 3 teams used an end of life care pathway and were aiming to develop a guideline Conclusion: There is variable practice regarding involvement of transport teams in palliative care transfers. There was support from most teams contacted for developing guidelines and more work is needed in this area.321 -POSTER PRESENTATIONTHE ROLE OF EMBRACE TRANSPORT SERVICE IN END OF LIFE CARE DECISIONS S. Hands, C. Harrison, L. Crabtree, A. Wolfendens Embrace Transport Service, Barnsley, UK Background: Embrace, paediatric and neonatal transport service, covering Yorkshire and Humber, carries out over 2000 transfers/year. Palliative care is an area of growing interest. Anecdotal reports suggest that dedicated transport services are becoming involved in decisions regarding end of life care. Transfers can be abandoned after referral due to clinical deterioration or death but the incidence of this and Embrace's involvement is unclear. Aims To identify the number of referrals where a transfer did not occur due to deterioration or death. To evaluate the role of the transport team in these situations Methods All Embrace transfers from April 2010 to March 2011 were included. Our data base was reviewed retrospectively to identify all cases where the patient had been referred but not transferred. Data categorised: \u2022 Neonatal/Paediatric \u2022 Reason transfer did not occur \u2022 patient died \u2022 pre arrival of team -after team arrived \u2022 parents decision ICU not appropriate \u2022 withdrawal of care decision Outcome of referral episode End of life decision Conclusions: Embrace is involved in end of life decisions having implications for service development/delivery. Transport teams need to work closely with referring and receiving clinicians to optimise these challenging situations 322 -POSTER PRESENTATION THE ROLE OF EMBRACE TRANSPORT SERVICE IN PALLIATIVE CARE TRANSFERS C. Harrison, S. Hands, L. Crabtree, A. Wolfendens Embrace Transport Service, Barnsley, UK Background: Embrace, a combined paediatric and neonatal transport service started in November 2009 covering Yorkshire and Humber area. It is the first combined team in the UK. In our first year of operation we received over 3000 referrals and carried out over 2000 transfers. Palliative care is an area of growing interest and there are now dedicated Childrens hospices around the UK-2 in the region Embrace covers. Currently there is little evidence of the role of transport teams in the palliative care setting or the demand for this type of transfer. Aim: To examine the involvement of Embrace in palliative care transfers in Yorkshire and Humber. Methods: All transfers from November 2009 -March1st 2010 were included. Using our transport database, we identified: \u2022 Number of palliative care transfers carried out \u2022 Patient destination. \u2022 Transport team composition. cases had a member of referring team with the patient for continuity. \u2022 Reason for palliative care: 5 chronic conditions with poor prognosis, 1 sepsis, 1 cardiac, 1 post cardiac arrest Conclusion: Transport teams are playing a vital part in children's end of life pathway moving them to hospice or home and requests for these transfers are increasing with a potential impact on service delivery and development. 323 -POSTER PRESENTATION IS RESPIRATORY RATE A GOOD PREDICTOR OF DETERIORATION IN PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS? G. Sefton, R. McEnaney, L. Tume, M. Horan, PEW Implementation Group PICU, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK Objective: To evaluate the reference ranges for respiratory rate, across age groups, within a Paediatric Early Warning tool (PEWT). To review the sensitivity and specificity of respiratory rate in predicting deterioration. Methods: A prospective point prevalence study of in-patients (n = 340) over a nine day period in January 2011. Patients in casualty, day-case, mental health, PICU or palliative care were excluded. Eight trained observers reviewed the vital signs and case notes for 72 h or discharge (whichever arose first). Outcomes reviewed included: incidence of PEWT triggers, medical interventions and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) (including unplanned admissions to HDU or PICU). Results: 27% of patients triggered the PEWT. Of these, 38 cases (41%) triggered repeatedly. There were 8 unplanned HDU/PICU admissions during this time period, but no cardiac arrest calls. Tachypnoea featured in isolation as an abnormal observation in 78% (n = 336), sets of vital signs which triggered PEWT but only 12% received a clinical intervention. One patient triggering on tachypnoea alone required PICU admission, deterioration was preceded by a distressing procedure. 7% of patients with a persistent tachypnoea ([1 set of vital signs) suffered a SAE. Tachypnoea combined with increased work of breathing was particularly significant. Conclusion: Reference ranges for PEWTs have largely been selected using consensus opinion. Tachypnoea in isolation poorly predicts potential for deterioration. Tachypnoea combined with tachycardia, desaturation or increased effort of breathing was most useful. Further research is needed to determine appropriate reference ranges for vital signs for sick children. POINT PREVALENCE STUDY OF PATIENTS TRIGGERING A MODIFIED BRISTOL PAEDIATRIC EARLY WARNING TOOL & THE INCIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EVENTS G. Sefton, L. Tume, M. Horan, PEW Implementation Group PICU, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK Objective: To review the vital signs of in-patients to predict those at risk of deterioration, using a modified Bristol Paediatric Early Warning Tool. To quantify seasonal impact on patients at risk of deterioration. To identify specific characteristics of 'risky' patients. Methods: A point prevalence study was undertaken in January 2011, and compared to a smaller study undertaken in August 2010. A team of trained observers reviewed vital signs and case notes to detect patients at risk of deterioration. 179 patients (Summer) and 340 patients (Winter) were reviewed. Patients in casualty, day-case, mental health, PICU or palliative care were excluded. Outcomes reviewed included: incidence of PEWT triggers, medical interventions and Serious Adverse Events (SAE). Results: In Winter 27% of patients triggered the PEWT compared with 20% of patients in the summer. There were significant proportion of HDU patients triggering the PEWT 85% in Winter compared with 66% in Summer. In winter 7/8 unplanned HDU/PICU admissions triggered PEW, compared with \u00bd in Summer. There were no cardiac arrest calls during either study period. Patients less than 1 year of age with identified as risky, particularly those with cardiac defects. In winter, babies with Bronchiolitis had a significant risk of unpredictable deterioration. Conclusion: There are seasonal variations in the patient populations triggering PEWT, which could impact on workforce planning. Both studies suggest that the single parameter mechanism for triggering PEWT is too sensitive. A stratified process for escalating patients triggering such systems would improve specificity. MOTHERS' KNOWLEDGE AND PERFORMANCE ABOUT APPLICATION OF SWADDLING A. Arbabisarjou 1 , M. Siroussi 2 , H. Robabi 1 , K. Omedi 3 , M. Sadeghian 4 Nursing, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Midwifery, 3 Nursing, Iranshahr School of Nursing & Midwifery, Iranshahr, 4 Educational Administration, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran Application of swaddling lead in decrease restlessness, crying, frequency of insomnia, stress and increase comfort and silence in infants. Despite of these advantages, if swaddling use inappropriately, would result in Dislocation of Hip. In this research we assess the Mothers' knowledge and performance about application of swaddling.Methodology: This is a descriptive-analytical research. We assess 211 mothers whom have infants 1-24 months with diarrhea. Data gathering tool was a questionnaire with interview. The validity of questionnaire confirmed through experts (Pediatricians, Faculty members in nursing and midwifery, orthopedist) and its reliability gained %91 through Cronach's alpha. Data analyzed by expert through SPSS version 16.00. Findings: Finding showed that the majority of mothers (%65) have not knowledge about benefits and pitfall of swaddling. % 86 of them knew that it was good for calming babies, sleeping and warming. %16 of them knew that swaddling may lead in dislocation of hip. Educated mothers and housekeepers swaddled their babies less than others.They told that they received information about swaddling from her mothers and relatives and very less from health professionals. Educated mothers told in the interview that they did not receive information about swaddling much from media and doctors (%65). In interviews analysis, found that they were interested in participated in classes about swaddling (%78) to learn the correct swaddling. Discussion: The plan for promotion of mothers' knowledge suggested through health workshop and practical teaching sessions by professional and governmental official is necessary.326 -POSTER FOR ORAL PRESENTATION AND POSTER PRESENTATION MORE SPACE, BETTER QUALITY CARE?

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted over a 12 month period in a single centre mixed cardiac and general PICU in the north of England. The Braden Q score in the first 24 h after ICU admission was matched to pressure area development. Device-related pressure areas were excluded. The data was divided into two categories, high risk (Braden Q score \\16) and low risk (Braden Q score [16) as per the tool validation (Curley et al.2003)Results: There were 1055 PICU admissions and 15 non-device related pressure areas (an incidence of 1.4%). 211 were classed as high risk (\\16) and 7 of these developed a pressure area (sensitivity 47%). 823 were classed as lower risk ([16) and 8 developed a pressure area (specificity 80%) This yielded a Positive Predictive Value of 3.3% and a Negative Predictive Value of 99% for the Braden Q score. 21 children had no recorded Braden Q score.

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted over a 12 month period in a single centre mixed cardiac and general PICU in the north of England. Results: In this 12 month period there were 1055 PICU admissions and 24 pressure areas giving an incidence of 2.2%. Of the 24 PAs, 15 were non-device related and 9 were device related. 8 (33.3%) were cardiac patients and 16 (66.6%) were general PICU patients. The median length of stay of the children who developed PAs was 17.5 days (2-56 total range) compared to the median LOS in PICU of 3 days (IQR 2-6)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF92": {"text": "Results: Between November and March 2009-2010 there were 85 children admitted to PICU with respiratory illnesses, of whom 7 (8.2%) tested positive for H1N1. This compares with 27 respiratory children the following year, of whom 2 (7.4%) had H1N1. During the first winter, the median time that the results took to return from the laboratory was 43 h, compared with 51 h the following year. Conclusions: In order to minimise the effects on isolated children and the workings of the PICU, the results time needs to be shortened. Until bedside testing kits become more refined, emphasis on the need for swift results needs to be communicated to the laboratories.SEEING RED: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUG TABARDS IN REDUCING INTERRUPTIONS DURING THE DRUG ADMINISTRATION PROCESS A.

Practice differs between care providers despite validated research. Varied expressions of pain. Pain is assessed subjectively, and depends on the nurse's knowledge, experience and acquaintance with the patient. Recommended guidelines for the use of oral glucose solution (OSS) as pain relief to premature and term neonates who undergo repeated painful procedures. The aim of this investigation was to review current knowledge about the effect of OSS on pain in neonates, and to develop guidelines for the use of OSS in premature and term neonates who undergo painful procedures. Methods: Using a literature search, we identified 8 clinical quantitative studies investigating the effect of OSS on pain amongst premature and term neonates. Results: All 8 studies unanimously conclude that OSS given as pain relief prior to acute painful procedures reduces behavioural expressions of pain amongst premature and term neonates. The studies do not document reduced physiological pain responses in response to OSS. Conclusion: According to the literature, OSS reduces behavioural expressions of pain. The nurse should be able to consider the individual child; it's situation and what the child is trying to communicate. The nurse's competency is decisive in order to comprehensively assess the child's need for and effect of pain relief such as OSS. We do not know which children will benefit from OSS. Therefore, OSS should be offered to all children, unless contra-indicated.339 -ORAL PRESENTATIONDOES THE COMFORT BEHAVIOR (COMFORT-B) SCALE DESERVE ITS POPULARITY? M. van Dijk, E. Ista, A. Boerlage, A. Valkenburg, D. Tibboel Intensive Care-Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Introduction: The COMFORT scale was developed in 1992 by psychologist Bruce Ambuel. This scale and an adapted version without physiological items (COMFORT-B scale) are used in PICUs world-wide. We performed three studies in 2009-2011 in our PICU addressing the following questions: (1) Is the COMFORT-B scale valid in infants with Down's syndrome? (2) Is a 2 min observation really necessary or could we do with a shorter period? (3) What is the sensitivity to change of the scale?Method: For study 1 we retrieved COMFORT-B scores for 76 infants with Down's syndrome and 466 infants without Down's syndrome (age 0 to 36 months) and applied confirmatory factor analysis. For study 2 we compared 236 simultaneous observations of two observers in 80 infants: one based the score on a 2 min observation, the other on a 30 s observation. For study 3 we collected 758 COMFORT-B scores in 185 PICU patients assigned before a pain-reducing intervention and 10 min to 2 h thereafter. Interrater reliability was tested and proven good in all studies. Results: 1. The COMFORT-B scale had a similar factor structure and cut-off values for pain for infants with and without Down's syndrome. 2. COMFORT-B scores of 17 or higher (suggesting pain) were assigned to 19% of the patients after 2 min observation and 11% after 30 s observation. 3. Sensitivity to change was excellent with an average decrease of 6 points (score range 6 to 30). Conclusion: The COMFORT-B scale has excellent psychometric properties and its wide-spread use is well deserved.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF94": {"text": "MULTI-DISCIPLINARY STAFF TRAINING FOR PORTABLE CT SCANNER USE IN PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT E.

An admission to PICU/NICU is a very stressful time for the family and recruiting and consenting of patients at this time is complex requiring an ethically optimal approach (Golec et al., 2004).This piece of work aims to identify those challenges and some of the strategies to overcome them. Methods: A structured Reflection process with a group of Paediatric and Neonatal research nurses discussing the challenges of conducting research in a PICU/NICU setting. Results: Some of the challenges discussed which were pertinent to both areas were issues surrounding consent (when is the best time), burden on the family (too many research projects), incorporating research into clinical staff time, availability of staff trained in good clinical practice, meeting high standards of research practice. Some of the strategies used for overcoming these challenges were staff training (teaching packages), good communication (logs, working on the unit, visual guides), clinical credibility of the research team, research team presence to ensure good understanding of the patient and family group, monitoring and promoting best practice.BRINGING PRACTICE TO RESEARCH: REFLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF BECOMING A PAEDIATRIC RESEARCH NURSE P.A.

Vukovi\u0107 2 Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, 2 Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, CroatiaLiver transplantation (LT) is one of the best examples of how modern medicine can successfully treat pediatric diseases that other ways would be fatal. This is one of the best examples that emphasize the significance of multidisciplinary approach and team work in modern medicine. Indications for pediatric liver transplantation are: extrahepatic biliary atresia (after unsuccessful Kasai procedure); cholestatic diseases (Byler's disease, Alagille's syndrome, biliary hypoplasia, liver cirrhosis as a consequence of alpha 1-antitrypsine deficiency, fulminant hepatitis regardless of etiology, hepatocelulary carcinoma, liver insufficiency as a consequence of autoimmune hepatitis or of unknown etiology. It is possible to perform LT in a child of any age (and weight) but it is preferred in children after 12 months (more than 10 kg). Pediatric LT team consists of several medical professionals. Nursing team is extremely important, from nurse LT coordinator, to specialized nurses in intensive care and gastroenterology units. After LT, children are treated in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), usually up to 4 weeks, and after that on pediatric gastroenterology ward. First successful pediatric LT in Croatia was performed in Zagreb in our hospital on 2001.

Darby 1 , D. Whiting 2 , J.

Furthermore emotional responses to injured children play an important role. Whilst children account for 25% of all admissions in deployed ICUs (HARRIS CC, McNICHOLAS JJK. 2009) with severe poly-trauma accounting for 10%, pre-deployment simulation training is largely orientated to adult patients.Methods: Descriptive study of modern-matron deployment to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan as part of Ministry of Defence/NHS ''Support to Operations.'' A core group of adult ICU nurses (including JW, DW), and DD formed to address training. A multi-disciplinary programme of core paediatric-trauma skills, the Bastion Trauma Course (BTC), was developed using multi-modal training with lectures, workshops, demonstrations and casualty simulation (Image 1). BTC was attended by both medical and nursing staff working in Afghanistan. Results: Feedback was very positive. Staff reported improved confidence and ability to facilitate optimal care for critically injured children. BTC was repeated several times at the request of military personal. Conclusions: Despite the pressure of war, training and education remain a high priority for the British Army as children are frequent casualties in war zones. Multi-modal training suited a wide variety of learning styles, and creating realistic casualty scenarios improved the educational experience.367 -POSTER PRESENTATIONEFFECT OF HOME VISIT ON MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY OF PRETERM NEWBORN M.

Methods: In a clinical trial 32 preterm infants under mechanical ventilation who had inclusion criteria were recruited in a simple convenient method. First they were placed in supine position for 120 min and then in side lying position for 120 min. Their SPO 2 were monitored by pulse oximeter and recorded each minute. Data analysis was done using SPSS (version 15). Methods: This study is a literature study based on nine original articles which includes 754 newborn infants, reviews, mandatory literature, procedures and other relevant literature. The infants in the study were 36 weeks or more in gestational age, were not to undergo surgical treatment within 3 days, or with major congenital abnormalities. Results: All the nine studies showed better neurological outcome in the cooled group. Adverse effects are common, but minor and not associated with cooling. Adverse outcomes include lower heart rate, hypertension, sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage and lower rate of platelet activating factor. Prolonged blood coagulation time and thrombocytopenia is also common. Most of the infants needed mechanical ventilation and some underwent hypoglycemia. Renal failure, skin changes, lower morphine clearance, and increased morphine concentrations are also common adverse effects during hypothermia treatment. Seizures are also seen often. Conclusions: It is important that the neonatal intensive care nurse is well trained and has exquisite knowledge about the thermal effect on the inner organs. She also needs knowledge about the normal newborn infant and when to act upon the child and when to let the child rest. The studies show that hypothermia is a safe treatment as long as the child is closely monitored and kept under surveillance. The nurse also need a clear ethical and legal foundation.Background and aims: Cranial molding of preterm infants can result in a number of negative consequences. In the Dutch Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) changing body and head position is used as an intervention to prevent cranial molding. A literature review was conducted to study the effects of interventions to prevent or reduce cranial molding of the preterm infant in NICU. Methods: A systematic literature review and critical appraisal according to the Cochrane Collaboration assessment criteria was performed. Results: Eight quantitative intervention studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Most studies used the anterior-posterior biparietal (AP:BP) ratio as measurement of cranial molding. One multicentred quasi experimental study showed that infants who received regular repositioning had a statistical significant reduction of bilateral head flattening compared to infants who did not receive this intervention AP:BP ratio 1.35 vs. 1.55 (p = 0.05). The interventions used in the other seven studies were pressure relief mattresses, watermatresses or gel pillows. No or no statistical significant effect was found in these studies. Conclusions: Because literature was restricted, the evidence is poor and limited to one intervention: regular body repositioning. The repositioning has to be studied more extensively to confirm the result as well as to establish the long term and side effects on respiration and motor development. Other interventions have to be studied in well designed studies for their effect. Acknowledgements: We thank the Dutch Innovation and Research group NICU's for their support. Objectives: Placement of a peripheral IV's (PIVs) in neonates is considered to be easy and safe. However in premature newborns it may require several attempts and cause complications. The aim of this study was to identify factors that attribute to complications in peripheral IV-therapy. A secondary aim was to evaluate the rate of IV-complications as a rationale for future interventional studies. Methods: This observational prospective study took place from August 2010 to May 2011. Data were collected for all PIV placements. Patient characteristics, type of professional performing the procedure, location of PIV, fixation method, cannula size were recorded by the caregiving nurse on a case record form for all PIV procedures. All newborns admitted to the neonatal ICU were eligible for the study. Data were entered in SPSS 17.0 for analysis. Results: Data of 302 insertions were analyzed. The PIVs were in place for a mean of 1.5 days. The mean number of needle sticks required for PIV placement was 2.4. More than half of the PIVs (55.6%) were removed due to extravasations and leakage. Other reasons to remove a PIV were occlusion (9.9%), swelling of the skin (9.4%), and phlebitis (4.4%). Conclusion: This study shows that there is room for improvement with regard to the number of attempted PIV placements and complications. The constructed CRF can be used to evaluate interventions aimed at improving PIV-related therapy in the premature newborn. Objectives: We have recently observed an increase in the number of unplanned extubations (UE's) occurring in our regional Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. A review of these cases was undertaken in an attempt to determine causative factors in order to reduce the incidence. Methods: Relevant critical incident forms completed between August 2010 and April 2011 were examined. All information relating directly to the events was recorded. Results: 7 UE's were recorded during this period. 4 of these children required reintubation within 12 h. 3 remained extubated. 3 of the 7 children were undertaking weaning of sedation in preparation for extubation later that day. In 2 of the 7 cases the nurse caring for the child was also caring for another patient. The remaining 5 were being cared for by a nurse whose only responsibility was to that child. Conclusions: In previous studies, reduced staffing levels with nurses caring for more than one ventilated patient were highlighted as reasons for an increase in UE's [1] . Although we found this to be a possible contributing factor in 2 of the cases, the primary reason, ascertained from the incident forms, appeared to be undersedation. In light of our findings, review of our sedation policy is currently underway. Background and aims: The postpartum period is a transitional time for mother and baby, emotionally, socially, physiologically. Care in this period is critical not only for survival but also to the future of mothers and newborn babies. Research was planned experimentally to determine the effect of structured education and counseling activities to primipara mothers by nurses on baby care and being a mother during the first 3 months of postpartum period. The use of the local anesthetic EMLA \u00d2 during painful procedures in children is becoming an increasingly common practice. Some of the techniques used seem to be more widely accepted than others. This study aimed to compare three techniques of EMLA \u00d2 cream application in terms of the pain during the removal of the protective dressing and the venipuncture (VP) for the child, parents/accompanying persons and nurse. A prospective, randomized and controlled clinical study was performed in 142 children aged 4-14 years attending the Outpatient Consultation of Medical Specialties and Subspecialties of a Pediatric Hospital and in need of VP. Of the three techniques used, technique C (basis of a teat and an elastic bandage) was considered painless, whereas the standard technique (waterproof adhesive) was the most painful (p \\ 0.05). The three techniques were effective in preventing pain in VP, and children, parents and nurses were unanimous in their preference for technique C. It was concluded that technique C is easy and quick to apply, costeffective and painless for the child, and that it is also the one preferred by parents and nurses. Thus, its use is recommended in this age group.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 6076, "end": 6079, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, IsraelAccording to professional books, the accepted practice in medicine is reference to dry facts, without emotions, thus the use of uncommon resources constitutes an ''antidote'' to regular learning. If the educator can use his imagination and to apply diverse techniques involving various senses and emotions, the trainee would be prevented from getting tired and would succeed better in the process of learning. The results of such learning would be higher than usual (Bradshaw & Lowenstein, 2007) . In the pediatric critical care department in Tel ha-Shomer Medical Centre, new personnel are continuously absorbed -and the successful absorption process is quite necessary here.

To contain this risk, we work hard at optimizing safety and quality of care on our ward. One of the measures introduced to this aim is application of the Critical Nursing Situation index (CNSI). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of protocol violations and how often a protocol violation could be corrected. Methods: The CNSI scores protocol violations in nine nursing care areas: basic care, circulation, respiration, digestive tract, infection parameters, invasive catheters, care for medication, ECMO and the central nervous system. The CNSI consists of 181 items scored by a trained nurse as: true (protocol violation), not true (=work according to protocol) or not applicable (for the patient under review). We analysed CNSI results obtained in randomly selected patients at the IC-Sophia Children's Hospital in the year 2009. Results: Fourteen nurses were trained to score the CNSI and interrater reliability was excellent (kappa 0.93 to 0.99). Altogether 238 CNSI forms in 127 patients were filled in. In total 11.7% of the applicable items were scored as a protocol violation. Direct or later correction of the protocol violation was feasible in 53.3% of the 986 violations. In 22.3%, the violation was purposeful due to specific patient situation. The number of protocol violations were not statistically significantly different between high care and intensive care patients (p = 0.86). Background: There is an increasing trend of parents refusing vitamin K (VK) prophylaxis for their newborn. Objective: To examine the basic knowledge and perceptions of expecting parents regarding newborn VK prophylaxis. Methods: We used anonymous questionnaires examining knowledge, perceptions, and cultural and religious barriers in a convenience sample of expecting parents-to-be during tours of the delivery rooms and postpartum units. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 219 participants; 151 were female, 66 were male. Eighty-five percent reported that they were expecting their first child and most of the women were in the third trimester of their pregnancy. Two-thirds of the participants had an academic degree yet exhibited a low level of knowledge regarding the necessity to provide VK to the newborn (22.5%), the source of the vitamin (15.5%), the action of the vitamin (34%) and the provision options available (29%). Expecting mothers exhibited more knowledge than fathers and many fathers reported ''not knowing.'' Few parents reported positive or negative perceptions towards providing VK. When examining the relationship between the knowledge and perceptions of first-time parents and the rest of the sample, no statistically significant differences were noted. However, more first-time parents reported that they had not yet decided whether they should provide VK once the baby was born (p \\ 0.05).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 493, "end": 522, "text": "(Bradshaw & Lowenstein, 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "L.

Introduction: Congenital and perinatal infections remain a stubborn and major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants throughout the world. The infant can also become infected from the vagina of the mother during birth. A congenital infection is an infection seen in the newborn infant that was acquired transplacentally during the first, second, or early third trimester. Aims: Intrauterine infection may occur quite early in pregnancy and remain undetected for months. Methods: Depending on the nature of infection, an appropriate sample is collected for laboratory identification. Authors performed a retrospective case series review at ten years care children's hospitals and publics pediatricians offices in Sarajevo. Results: The incidence of congenital infection in the fetus and newborn infant is relatively high at 1.5% in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The possibility of congenital or perinatal infection in neonates is usually considered because of the diagnosis of, or concern about a specificinfection in, a mother during pregnancy that can be transmitted to the neonate or because of clinical findings in the neonate at birth that suggest an infectious cause.Conclusion: While there are a large number of pathogens that can occasionally be harmful for the unborn child, some are of considerable public health impact, for example rubella, varicella, syphilis, hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis, or infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A more strategy has to be adopted if treatment needs to be given to the mother in order to prevent permanent damage of the child.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "Paediatric Intensive Care, Guys and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK Background/aims: Pain assessment during hospitalisation in children is notoriously difficult due to the differences in emotional and cognitive development of this patient group (RCN, 2009 ). This task is made more difficult in the Peadiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) where children are often ventilated and sedated and therefore unable to verbally report pain. The aim was to explore the lived experience of PICU nurses in PICU regarding the assessment and management of pain. Methods: A focus group of 6 nurses of all grades was conducted and recorded using a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts were analysed using a phenomenological approach with colaizzi's 7 procedural steps as a framework. Results: Pain assessment was felt to be lacking and the value of it diminished due to the lack of an algorithm to guide the process and lack of meaning assigned to the score. The current tool which was used was felt not to reflect pain behaviours and user fatigue was apparent. Staff felt that the pain assessment process needed to be improved, with education and the introduction of an appropriate tool for use in this patient group a priority. Conclusions: From the discussion it was apparent that Pain assessment needed to be formalised and improved in the PICU. This focus group prompted a review of the literature to identify a suitable pain score for use in the PICU and subsequent development of a new tool which is currently in the testing phase. Introduction: The SOS was found valid and reliable to screen for benzodiazepine and opioid withdrawal syndrome in PICU patients. We aimed to establish reliable cutoff scores and to test the scale's sensitivity to change in a large sample.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 267, "text": "(RCN, 2009", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "J.

User involvement in designing these studies and improving consent during this critical period would further enhance practice. Little is known about how nursing staff view their participation in clinical research, especially within neonatal care. It has been suggested that nurses are generally supportive of research, although participation may be influenced by time pressures, care of their patient, and limited experience of research. We designed a qualitative study to explore these influences. Objective: To explore neonatal nurses views of clinical research, and their perception of nurses' role in the research process. Method: Thirty-one nurses from a neonatal service participated in semi-structured interviews, which were analysed through the constant comparative method, assisted by NVivo software. Results: Nurses are supportive of clinical research, and recognise its importance in delivering the best care to their patients. Despite appreciating the benefits of research involvement, nurses see their primary role as advocates for the babies and their families, promoting clinical care above research. Nurses do not view themselves as involved in research, although they perform supportive tasks (such as collecting samples, recording data), and see this as part of their caring role. In particular, research is seen as an integral part of working in an intensive care unit, although nurses experience challenges in accessing and assimilating research information. Conclusions: Nurses play an important research role by promoting studies, collecting data, and acting as advocates for their patients. Although research support is seen as an integral part of their role, nurses do not feel engaged with the research process, influencing their level of participation, and thus the success of clinical research projects. Introduction: Anal fissure is a linear longitudinal defect in the lining of the anal canal extending usually from the dentate line to the anal verge. Anal fissures affect all age groups. The most dominant symptoms are pain and rectal bleeding. Anal fissure is a disease which affects quality of life of patients. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine problems of parents of children with anal fissure and their needs of the education. Material and method: In this descriptive study, the data were collected in between November 2010-January 2011. The data were collected using a 20-question survey form. The study sampling group is consisted of 25 children with diagnosis of anal fissure, and their parents whose admitted to pediatric surgical outpatient unit. In evaluation of data SSPS.15 was applied. Results: The 25 patients, included in the study, have 60% pain, 96% strain during stool, 56% have rectal bleeding, 76% cry during stool, 60% postpone the stool. It is determined that 56% of the parents have no information about anal fissure. All of the parents (%100) reported their information needs about the care and the treatment of anal fissure. Conclusions: In this study, it is determined that there was a lack of information in parents about anal fissure so it can be cause some wrong implications such as noncompliance with diet. It is recommended that parents of anal fissured children should be informed by information booklet, diet programs and compliance with the treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "-ORAL PRESENTATION"}]}
