Brain-injured patients with altered consciousness frequently require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation to protect the airways from aspiration and to prevent harmful secondary insults, such as hypoxemia [generally defined as an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) < 60 mmHg] and hypercapnia [generally defined as an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) > 45 mmHg] [2] . TBI patients may develop severe respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during intensive care unit (ICU) stay [3, 4] . Lung-protective ventilation strategies, with low tidal volumes (TVs) and moderate-to-high positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP), are associated with improved outcomes in ARDS and non-ARDS patients [5, 6] and are characterized by \"low ranges\" oxygenation targets and permissive hypercapnia [7, 8] . This approach, considering its potential adverse cerebrovascular effects, is difficult to apply in TBI patients, regardless of the presence of intracranial hypertension [2, 9, 10] . Traditionally, in TBI patients, low PEEP and high TVs are generally applied for tight CO 2 control [5] ; however, recent evidence suggests that, even in TBI patients, the use of high TVs is associated with the development of acute lung injury [9, 11] . As such, brain-injured patients have been excluded from the major trials exploring the effect of lung-protective ventilation strategies in ARDS [12, 13] , and consequently optimal ventilatory strategies have not been established yet in this setting [14, 15] .

PEEP reduces atelectasis and improves PaO 2 and lung compliance [7] . Traditionally, low PEEP levels (\u2264 5 mmHg) have been utilized in acute brain injury patients admitted to ICU [5] , because of the potential risks on cerebral circulation and intracranial pressure (ICP); in particular, the effect of PEEP on ICP seems to be related to both hemodynamic factors and respiratory system compliance [9, 10] . Elevated PEEP levels may reduce systemic venous return, mean arterial pressure and consequently cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with detrimental consequences on cerebral blood flow (CBF), mainly in cases of altered cerebral autoregulation [16] . On the other hand, respiratory system compliance influences the effect of PEEP on ICP and brain circulation [17] [18] [19] : in patients with low compliance, a PEEP increase (up to 10-12 cmH 2 O) is not associated with ICP increase; in contrast, in patients with normal compliance, PEEP induces lung overdistension, reduction in cerebral venous return and ICP increases. We found that most of our respondents utilize lower PEEP levels in case of intracranial hypertension, thus suggesting that there is still concern regarding the cerebrovascular [20] . Probably, the availability of adequate neuro and cardiorespiratory monitoring tools could be useful in setting the right level of PEEP, but more prospective randomized studies are needed to identify the correct level of PEEP in head-injured patients. Data from our survey show that hyperventilation is not often utilized in TBI patients. This is probably related to the potential ischemic side effects of hypocapnia on the injured brain [21] . Currently, hyperventilation is suggested only in case of emergency with lifethreatening risk of cerebral herniation [22] . However, recent findings suggested that mild, short-term hyperventilation is able to reduce ICP, without a clinically significant reduction of cerebral oxygenation and metabolism [23] .

Second, respondents from specialized NICUs were included together with those working in general ICUs. This might be considered a methodological limitation but, as TBI patients are treated worldwide not only in specialized NICUs, we believe that our approach produced more generalizable findings. Third, this survey was developed by two investigators without a prior systematic review of the literature or pilot testing in a smaller sample of participants; this might further limit the quality of the questionnaire and data.
