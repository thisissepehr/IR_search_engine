undergoes intensive development during the first years of life. 1 However, both, adaptive and innate immunity do not reach full capacity until teenage years. 2, 3 The immune system is thus shaped by different external factors until adolescence. 4 A malfunctioning immune system not only leads to higher susceptibility to infections but can also cause atopic diseases like asthma and allergies. 5 According to the 'hygiene hypothesis' it was shown that children raised on farms or children in contact with dogs have a lower risk of developing asthma or allergies due to their environmental (e.g. microbial) exposures. 4, 6 Furthermore, infections with different respiratory viruses (e.g. rhinovirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) in infancy influence the development of chronic and immune-mediated diseases like asthma, type 1 diabetes and obesity in later life. [7] [8] [9] Although many birth cohort studies have addressed asthma and allergies, only two studies, the INSPIRE study in the USA and the ORChID study in Australia, have focussed on infections and the development of atopic diseases. [10] [11] [12] However, INSPIRE lacks comprehensive data on infections during childhood and ORChID has a small sample size and collected data on infections only for 2 years. In order to prospectively assess the complete infection history during the first 6 years of life, we have initiated the German multicentre LoewenKIDS birth cohort study in 2015. The aim of this study is to combine the complete infection history with information on the development of the nasal and gut microbiome and the immune system, as well as the genetic background and information on the children's environment (nutrition, pets, siblings, day-care attendance, medication etc.). These data will help us to understand the association between infections, vaccinations, the microbiome, and genetics on the one side and immune-mediated diseases like atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and allergies on the other side.

Stool samples are transported via mail and stored at -80 C in RNASepar Solution (Biosepar).

Here, we aim to use symptomatic nasal swabs and stool samples to identify causal pathogens of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. For pathogen identification, we plan to implement a wide assay including 39 respiratory and 36 gastrointestinal pathogens (Allplex TM Respiratory Panel Assays and Allplex TM Gastrointestinal Panel Assays, Seegene). Our focus is on viruses and we expect prevalence of human respiratory virus and respiratory syncytial virus as well as rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus. 13 Nevertheless, research on other causative agents of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections is planned or may evolve in future collaborations. Furthermore, all nasal swabs and stool samples will be analysed regarding changes of microbial community composition over time and with respect to influencing factors like infections, vaccinations, antibiotic intake and breastfeeding/nutrition over time. Analyses based on 16S rRNA gene region sequencing are part of the analysis plan. This can be further extended to metagenome or metatranscriptome analyses for specific questions in subsets of eligible samples. Identification of the virome and mycobiome will give insights into a holistic understanding of the overall microbial development within the first years of life. Blood samples will be used to determine cytokine and serological patterns as well as cellular immunoprofiles after infections and vaccination, but may also be analysed with regard to certain microbiota enterotypes or extrinsic factors like breastfeeding/nutrition. Buccal swabs will be used to determine the genetic background, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms, with regard to infection susceptibility, asthma predisposition or responsiveness to vaccinations. In the long-term, all of these data can be connected, and once asthma and atopic diseases become prevalent in the LoewenKIDS cohort, they will be linked to the development of atopic diseases and allergies.

Characteristics of parents and children of the main cohort and subcohort showed no differences, thus results are combined and reported in detail in Tables 3 and 4 . The mean age of mothers and fathers at birth was 33 years [standard deviation (SD) 6 4 years] and 35 years (SD 6 5 years), respectively ( Table 3 ). The average age of German mothers at birth is 30 years (not available for fathers). 15 Our mothers are thus older than average. Concerning the parents' education, 15% and 16% of the mothers and fathers completed an apprenticeship (German 'Lehre'), 45% and 46% held a master's degree or diploma and 16% and 12% a PhD (Table 3 ). In contrast, 45% of the German general population between 30 and 40 years of age completed an apprenticeship, 22% a master's degree or diploma and only 2% hold a PhD. 29 Our study is thus characterized by a highly educated study population, explaining the age of mothers at birth being above average. Furthermore, LoewenKIDS participants may have been intrigued to take part in our study because of their own background in academia. Of our study participants, 39% had a monthly household net income lower than 4000 Euro, 21% between 4000 and 5000 Euro and 25% above 5000 Euro (15% missing or unknown). With the average monthly net houshold income being 4761 Euro in Germany, the household income of our cohort is approximately average despite a high education level. 16 Most prevalent diseases in the family histories of participating parents were allergies, with 69% affected by hay fever, 48% affected by house dust mite allergy and 46% affected by pet hair allergy. Lactose intolerance was the most common food intolerance with 23% of families affected. In the German general population, 15% are affected by hay fever and less by house dust mite and pet hair allergy, thus families of our cohort may be especially affected by allergies. 17 Furthermore, neurodermatitis, asthma and diabetes type II were highly prevalent in the family histories of our study participants (42%, 32% and 21%, respectively). In the German general population over all age groups, the prevalences of neurodermatitis, asthma and diabetes (type I and II) are 4%, 9% and 7%, respectively. 17, 19 The high prevalence observed in our study may partly be due to biased sampling and an increased willingness to participate in parents with a history of these illnesses.
