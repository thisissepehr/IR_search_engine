These Principles identified priorities for leaders and scientists to adopt when faced with the global reality of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Priorities included: recognizing the connections between human, domestic animal, and wildlife health; forming collaborative relationships that foster integration of human and animal surveillance networks; and investing in a mechanism to raise awareness among policy-makers in order to ''improve prospects for a healthier planet''.",

This was not always an easy sell as most health practitioners functioned within their individual disciplines and were not familiar or comfortable with engaging new colleagues with differing institutional mandates. The strongest advocates originated from animal health sectors, (http://www.avma.org/onehealth/ onehealth_final.pdf), although endorsements also came from established human health organizations such as the American Medical Association (http:// www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/aug07/070801b.asp) and the American Society of Microbiology (http://asm.org/asm/images/pdf/AtlasPresentation.pdf).",

Given the global anxiety surrounding Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and the availability of funding for pandemic preparedness, the One Health movement acquired an even larger following, and visionary One Health advocates were met with an expanded audience. Within a short period of time, momentum for a One Health approach was promoted by a series of highprofile national and international meetings that extolled vision but seldom led to action items.",

This forum developed a Strategic Framework for Reducing Risks of Infectious Diseases at the Animal-Human-Ecosystems Interface (http://un-influenza.org/files/OWOH_ 14Oct08.pdf). The resulting strategy document described the necessity of building upon HPAI H5N1 preparedness to include all emerging infectious diseases, and focused on diseases at the animal, human, and ecosystem interface.

Specific recommendations from this meeting included: fostering political will; supporting partnerships and collaboration; encouraging data sharing and integration; building capacity; developing communication strategies and plans; providing incentives for reporting adverse events; encouraging stakeholder and community engagement; and developing supra-country approaches (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/2009/er-rc/pdf/errc-eng.pdf).

Then, in April 2010, the third IMCAPI meeting was held in Hanoi (http:// un-influenza.org/node/4040). The declaration that emerged from this IMCAPI called for a global recognition of the need to ''better understand the emergence of disease threats at the animal-human-environment interface through multi-sector actions, and to develop appropriate and sustainable means to reduce such threats''. And finally, later in April 2010, FAO, OIE, and WHO released A Tripartite Concept Note reinforcing their organization's collaborative intent to combat pathogens at the interface between animal, human, and ecosystem health (http:// www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Current_Scientific_Issues/docs/pdf/FINAL_CO-NCEPT_NOTE_Hanoi.pdf).",

Impediments to action included the lack of a consensus definition for One Health, the excessive size of the meeting, and the predominance of attendees from the animal health community. Winnipeg, like earlier meetings, invited representatives from many sectors, including public health, food protection, ecosystem health, climate change, and both wildlife and domestic animal representatives. Quite understandably, each of these groups came with their own concept of how One Health should be defined. It is to note that the timing of the Winnipeg meeting coincided with a general belief that in order to be successful, it was necessary that an all-encompassing and uniformly endorsed definition of ''One Health'' be identified. Many participants related that they felt that, despite what the agenda said, discussion frequently devolved to debating a consensus definition.",

An imbalance in representation may have led to reiterations of previous discussions and renewals of the existing collaborations rather than formation of innovative alliances.

This detail restricted the number of participants to a maximum of 54, thereby overcoming the impediment of inflated participation that was identified during review of the Winnipeg meeting. The attendee list was defined by category of subject matter expertise (i.e., human health, wildlife, domestic animal, economist, and plant health) and geographical representation, but not organizational representation. Definition of invitees by category deliberately conveyed that no single individual was essential to the success of the meeting; the key to moving forward was the balance in areas of expertise created by the attendees. Each organization represented on the core planning committee was assigned a number of attendee slots that it could fill. However, before any invitation was extended, the credentials of that candidate were reviewed, debated, and approved by the entire committee. No invitee was allowed to self-select a replacement. A selection criteria grid mandated that animal, human, and ecosystem health were equitably represented. It is of note that no one on the planning committee knew everyone on the invitee list, and thus it was not simply the same group of people getting together (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "In his 1962 publication The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Kuhn 1962) , Thomas Kuhn used the term paradigm to refer to a set of practices that define a scientific discipline during a specified period of time. He said that a paradigm shift occurs when scientists encounter anomalies which cannot be handled using the prevailing paradigm. He went on to say if there were enough significant anomalies then a crisis would ensue and a new paradigm would need to be generated. The prevailing paradigm for disease control and prevention has not facilitated or promoted coordination among animal, human, and ecosystem sectors. This paradigm was repeatedly tested when the global community was presented with 'anomalies' such as HIV, SARS, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1. Response to these challenges would have been optimized if there had been coordinated surveillance, response and intervention among human, animal, and environmental health sectors. This lack of overall coordination may have constituted Kuhn's definition of a crisis, and thus provided the basis for consideration of a twenty-first century One Health paradigm. According to Kuhn, the new paradigm is not just a gradual refinement of the old. Rather, it requires deliberate changes in the way scientists approach problems such as emerging pathogens.",
