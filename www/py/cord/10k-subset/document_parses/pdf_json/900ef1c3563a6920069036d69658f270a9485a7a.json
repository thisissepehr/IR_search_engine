            "text": "Serious illnesses such as Ebola are often highly publicized in the mass media and can be associated with varying levels of anxiety and compensatory safety behavior (e.g., avoidance of air travel). The present study investigated psychological processes associated with Ebola-related anxiety and safety behaviors during the outbreak in late 2014. Between October 30 and December 3, 2014, which encompassed the peak of concerns and of the media's attention to this particular outbreak, 107 university students completed a battery of measures assessing fear of Ebola, performance of safety behaviors, factual knowledge of the virus, and psychological variables hypothesized to predict Ebola-related fear. We found that while our sample was generally not very fearful of contracting Ebola, the fear of this disease was correlated with general distress, contamination cognitions, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns. Regression analyses further indicated that anxiety sensitivity related to physical concerns and the tendency to overestimate the severity of contamination were unique predictors of both Ebola fear and associated safety behaviors. Implications for how concerns over serious illness outbreaks can be conceptualized and clinically managed are discussed.",

People with health anxiety also engage in a number of behaviors that function to reduce their distress, such as frequently visiting doctors, excessively researching diseases and their symptoms on the internet, or seeking reassurance from loved ones. Although such health-related ''safety behaviors'' may reduce associated distress in the short-term (Abramowitz and Moore 2007) , research suggests that these behaviors maintain anxiety in the long-term (see Helbig-Lang and Petermann 2010) . Although a diagnostic entity in itself (i.e., Illness Anxiety Disorder [IAD] ), health anxiety may be present in a number of psychological disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), somatic symptom disorders, and other anxiety disorders (APA 2013). Clinically severe health anxiety and associated safety behaviors may result in significant distress and functional impairment (APA 2013). Researchers and clinicians have long observed increases in health anxiety referrals during times of mass media coverage of serious diseases, such as during the Ebola outbreak in late 2014.",

Although experimental vaccines and treatments are in development, there is no FDA-approved medicine available for Ebola to date. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention have chronicled 35 Ebola virus outbreaks between 1976 and 2014, varying in severity (CDC 2014) . The 2014 multinational outbreak in West Africa (i.e., Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) has been deemed the largest outbreak, with at least 21,000 affected human cases accounting for nearly 9000 deaths worldwide (CDC 2014) . Between September 30, 2014, and October 23, 2014 , the CDC documented two imported cases, including one death, and two locally acquired cases in the U.S. (Dallas, TX, and New York, NY) . Accordingly, the CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center, deployed public health experts to the affected regions, and issued an advisory against nonessential travel to West Africa (i.e., Level 3 travel notice).",

For example, during the height of the Ebola concern, certain U.S. shops, school districts, and state governments enacted substantial ''precautionary measures'' against a seemingly remote danger (Fox 2014) . In Maine, one healthcare worker contested forced quarantine in her own home for 21 days after returning from Sierra Leone despite showing no symptoms and twice testing negative for Ebola. As of October 14, 2014, approximately two-thirds of U.S. residents surveyed reported fears about an Ebola outbreak in the U.S (Dennis and Craighill 2014) .",

Anecdotally, in our clinics we assessed multiple patients whose presentation of OCD and IAD included concerns about contracting Ebola. Some criticized the media for exaggerating the risk of Ebola spreading to the U.S. and obfuscating the CDC's message that ''Ebola poses no substantial risk to the U.S. general population'' (CDC Health Alert Network 2014). Other groups in the popular press (e.g., Robbins 2014) even coined the term ''Fearbola'' to refer to the U.S. public's exaggerated collective response to the very low threat of a domestic Ebola outbreak. To this end, the American Psychological Association (APA 2014) disseminated tips for ''managing your fear about Ebola'' (i.e., keep things in perspective, get the facts); yet it is unclear if-or how-such counsel was effective.",

Accordingly, we designed the present study during the height of U.S. concerns about Ebola to better understand the psychological factors associated with Fearbola and engagement in Ebola-related safety behaviors. Informed by the limited body of recent research on anxiety among students in response to pandemic illnesses such as SARS (e.g., Wong et al. 2007 ), avian flu (e.g., Lau et al. 2008) , and H1N1 (e.g., Wheaton et al. 2012 ), we considered a variety of constructs that might predict the fear of Ebola, as we describe next.",

Second, because Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids, it is possible that those holding dysfunctional beliefs about contamination are more vulnerable to excessive fear of Ebola. In other words, Fearbola may reflect an overestimation of the likelihood and severity of contamination during a global outbreak. Third, disgust sensitivity, or one's propensity to experience disgust across multiple domains, has also been identified as a key feature of contamination fear (Cisler et al. 2010; Olatunji and Sawchuk 2005) . Thus, we also considered heightened disgust responding as a potentially important process that may be related not only to contamination aversion broadly, but also to Ebola fear specifically.",

Indeed, Olatunji et al. (2007a) found that body vigilance was strongly correlated with health anxiety symptoms in both clinical and nonclinical adult samples. Relatedly, anxiety sensitivity, the tendency to misconstrue benign anxious arousal sensations as dangerous (Taylor et al. 2007) , may also predict Ebola fear and safety behavior performance.

Because cognitive models of pathological anxiety emphasize the therapeutic effects of corrective information (e.g., Abramowitz et al. 2011; Clark 1986) , one might predict that those possessing greater understanding about Ebola would report less anxious responding to the possibility of a domestic outbreak. As summarized above, the extant literature provides clues to the factors that might predict Ebola-related fear and safety behaviors. Accordingly, we hypothesized that less factual knowledge about the virus, but greater levels of general distress, contamination cognitions, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety sensitivity, would predict greater Ebola-related fear and engagement in Ebolarelated safety behaviors.",

We hypothesized that in our unselected U.S. university student sample, greater anxiety sensitivity, body vigilance, disgust sensitivity, contamination concerns, and general psychological distress would predict greater Ebola fear and engagement in safety behaviors (e.g., avoiding airports) with the intention of preventing infection. We also hypothesized that having more factual knowledge about the Ebola virus and the details of the 2014 outbreak would predict less Ebola-related fear and safety behavior use. To address the study's aim, we developed brief measures of Ebola related fear and safety behavior use, which both demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. Consistent with our predictions, Ebola fear and safety behaviors were correlated with general distress, contamination cognitions, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety sensitivity related to physical concerns. Contrary to our predictions, fear of the disease was not associated with knowledge about the Ebola virus and the 2014 outbreak. When considered simultaneously in our regression model, the tendency to overestimate the severity of contamination emerged as the only significant predictors of both Ebola fear and associated safety behaviors. Physical anxiety sensitivity concerns significantly predicted Ebola fear but only marginally predicted Ebola safety behaviors, and disgust sensitivity only significantly predicted safety behavior use. Body vigilance only marginally significantly predicted engagement in Ebola related safety behaviors. Overall, our findings provided partial support for our hypotheses.",

Given our access to a large unselected population of young adults exposed to media coverage of the Ebola outbreak, we were well positioned to identify the predictors of Ebola-related fear and safety behaviors. Clarifying the factors that might contribute to such anxiety is valuable in understanding how the public responds to large-scale illness threats more generally and identifying individuals who might be vulnerable to maladaptive responses (i.e., health anxiety). It may also be of service in developing prevention programs and clinical intervention strategies should the threat of another global panic surface. That is, our study's findings suggest that contamination concerns and physical concerns related to anxiety sensitivity may be especially important in the experience of Ebola-related anxiety and safety behaviors, regardless of accurate factual understanding of the disease.",

            "text": "Anxiety sensitivity along physical domains significantly predicted Ebola fear, but only marginally predicted Ebola safety behavior use. Although our findings are cross-sectional, one way anxiety sensitivity might contribute to fearful responding to the Ebola virus is through the misperception of benign (and universal) body sensations as dangerous. Such a perception might especially lead to fear considering that many body sensations associated with anxiety mirror the symptoms of Ebola (e.g., nausea). It is also not surprising that concerns regarding the severity of contamination significantly predicted Ebola fear and safety behavior use. Ebola is indeed a severe illness with extremely unpleasant symptoms (e.g., fever and hemorrhaging), but it is possible that the frequent, widespread media coverage in the U.S. led residents to overestimate the severity of the disease. Similar possibilities were discussed in a study of undergraduates' fearful responding to the heavily publicized H1N1 pandemic in 2009 (Wheaton et al. 2012 . Findings from our study cannot, however, provide causal evidence for the role of increased media coverage on increased Ebola fear and safety behavior use. It is interesting that factual knowledge about Ebola was unrelated to respondents' degree of Ebola fear and engagement in related safety behaviors. Our findings, however, can be seen as consistent with previous work suggesting that accurate information (e.g., illness incidence statistics) is unrelated to anxiety symptoms (e.g., Moritz and Pohl 2009) . Our EFQ items were derived from a quiz posted to a popular online media source (www.usatoday. com). Although the psychometric properties of this measure are unknown, the distribution of scores in our sample was free of skew or kurtosis and approximated normality. Ebola is a serious disease, and the 2014 outbreak was appropriately declared a ''public health emergency of international concern'' by the World Health Organization (WHO Ebola Response Team 2014). Yet as National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci noted, ''what we're seeing is a catastrophic health crisis in West Africa, and an epidemic of fear here'' (C-SPAN2 2014) . In this sense, the U.S. Fearbola outbreak was arguably a greater threat to the wellbeing of U.S. residents than the actual Ebola virus itself.",

This possibility carries clinical relevance, for cognitive models posit that dysfunctional beliefs (e.g., threat overestimates) are meaningful factors in the etiology of pathological anxiety that should be targeted during treatment (e.g., Fergus 2014; Obsessive-Compulsive Cognitions Working Group 1997 Group , 2003 Group , 2005 Salkovskis and Warwick 2001; Taylor and Asmundson 2004 ). An alternative explanation for our finding is that some participants coped with their fear of Ebola by seeking out knowledge and information about the disease (akin to reassuranceseeking in health anxiety), thus washing out the hypothesized effect. Therefore, findings from our study may inform cognitive interventions, as providing accurate information regarding the nature and severity of focal disease outbreaks may be insufficient to adequately challenge dysfunctional health-and illness-related beliefs. Because our study included a nonclinical sample, however, future research utilizing healthy and health anxious individuals would help determine whether providing accurate information about the risk of disease outbreaks in the U.S. is sufficient to mitigate such illness fears in clinical practice.",

            "text": "Our study measures were largely inspired by those designed by Wheaton et al. (2012) in their investigation of anxious responding to the H1N1 influenza outbreak of 2009-2010. These authors reported that contamination cognitions (both likelihood and severity overestimates), disgust sensitivity, and health anxiety significantly predicted H1N1 fear, but that physical concern-related anxiety sensitivity, body vigilance, and general distress did not. Therefore, our findings are somewhat consistent with Wheaton and colleagues. One possible explanation for the discrepant findings relates to disgust-related elements (e.g., sympathetic magic) differentially associated with the H1N1 and Ebola viruses. The peak of the 2014 Fearbola panic saw only four total U.S. human cases (only two of which were contracted locally), yet 2009-2010 witnessed approximately 60.8 million H1N1 U.S. cases (Shrestha et al. 2011 ). Therefore, Ebola may have been perceived as more distant and remote a threat than the H1N1 virus was in 2009-2010. Another consideration is that H1N1 is a more communicable virus than Ebola, which would make disgust a more powerful predictor of anxious responding to H1N1 than Ebola. In contrast, mechanisms such as the laws of contagion, similarity, or sympathetic magic (see Cisler et al. 2009 ) may have been more relevant for U.S. residents reporting greater Ebola fear. Unfortunately, this study did not assess participants' perceptions of contagion related to the Ebola outbreak specifically, so such explanations are purely speculative. Future research investigating the degree to which certain outbreaks are specifically perceived as disgusting, dangerous, and controllable are warranted.",

First, participants were undergraduate students; as such, this sample was presumably healthy on average-physically and psychologically. Therefore, our findings may not apply to individuals with clinical levels of health anxiety (e.g., hypochondriasis, OCD) or medical vulnerability (e.g., autoimmune diseases). However, this study's findings may nevertheless be useful in informing clinical interventions for disease outbreak-related fears among otherwise healthy individuals. A second limitation is that participants in our study were recruited from a single southeastern university. Individuals living in less populated areas (e.g., Wyoming) or in states with confirmed Ebola cases (e.g., Texas) may have experienced different levels of concern. Similar studies utilizing more geographically representative samples would be desirable. A third limitation is that all data were obtained via self-report, which might inflate associations among variables. Future studies utilizing multi-method assessment are warranted. Finally, the cross-sectional design of this study precludes causal or directional conclusions. It is possible that individuals with greater contamination concerns are more prone to respond fearfully to Ebola, that those with higher Ebola fear were more likely to develop contamination concerns, or that one or more other factors (e.g., observational learning, informational transmission) contributed to both high contamination concerns and Ebola fear. Future longitudinal studies are necessary to determine which constructs prospectively predict the onset of health anxiety in response to the threat of a serious disease. Similarly, the possibility that safety behaviors generate or exacerbate Ebola concerns is especially worthy of consideration in light of research showing that deliberately engaging in health-related safety behaviors (e.g., avoiding public contaminants) causes individuals to become more concerned with the risks of contamination (Deacon and Maack 2008; Olatunji et al. 2011) . Although these limitations somewhat qualify the generalizability of our findings, the present study offers data relevant to understanding the psychological predictors of anxious responding to publicized epidemics.",
