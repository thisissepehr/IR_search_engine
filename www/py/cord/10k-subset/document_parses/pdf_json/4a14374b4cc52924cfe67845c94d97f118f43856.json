New therapeutics are desperately needed, especially those that target the underlying causes and prevent disease progression. Although asthma and COPD have distinct etiologies, both are associated with reduced airflow caused by excess infiltration of inflammatory cells into healthy lung tissues. As selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium is a key early event in the initiation of the inflammatory response, selectin inhibition is thought to be a good target for therapeutic intervention.",

Although many selectin inhibitors have shown activity in preclinical models, clinical progress of selectin-directed therapies has been slow. Early approaches employed carbohydrate-based inhibitors to mimic the natural ligand sialyl Lewis X; however, these compounds proved challenging to develop. Cytel's CY 1503, a complex oligosaccharide, progressed to phase II/III trials for reperfusion injury, but further development was halted when it failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Two protein-based selectin inhibitors have reached phase II development. These included Wyeth's recombinant soluble P-selectin ligand, TSI (PSGL-1), which was discontinued after disappointing results in myocardial infarction trials and Protein Design Labs' humanized anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody, which is currently in development for trauma. Bimosiamose, discovered by Encysive Pharmaceutical and presently being developed by Revotar Biopharmaceuticals, is an 863 g/mol molecular weight dimer with minimal carbohydrate content and is, to date, the leading selectin inhibitor in clinical development. This compound has shown promise in a phase IIa 'proof of concept' trial in patients with asthma, reducing airway recruitment of eosinophils after intravenous administration. Further clinical development of an inhaled formulation is underway.",

The various selectin-ligand pairs interact with distinct binding affinities and kinetics, allowing the selectins to mediate tethering, rolling and adhesion between various cell types in a wide range of in vivo settings. Specialized interactions allow them to perform their functions in the shear flow forces of the bloodstream, including rapid association/dissociation (on/off) rates, ligand clustering and dimerization, and multivalent oligosaccharide binding sites. [16] Remarkably, selectin-mediated adhesion is actually enhanced by shear stress. [17] The unique properties of the selectin-ligand interaction have made it difficult to measure selectin activity using in vitro assays, and may have hindered progress in the field.

[7, 27] Furthermore, the expression of each selectin is regulated via a different mechanism, providing several opportunities for blockade. P-Selectin is stored in secretory vesicles of endothelial cells (Weibel-Palade bodies) and platelets (\u03b1granules), and is rapidly transported to the cell surface upon activation by mediators such as histamine or thrombin. E-Selectin is regulated at the transcriptional level, and thus appears on the surface more slowly. It is expressed on endothelial cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. L-Selectin is constitutively expressed on all leukocytes, and upon cell activation it can be patients to date. [29, 30] The LAD II mutation causes a defect in carbohydrate inhibitors.
