What was medicine's tradition in times of pestilence? Can history help answer the question of obligation? Unfortunately, the historical record is rather mixed.

This may be especially true if respondents have no reason to believe their input will bear fruit. However, we have experienced an encouraging increase in responses to more recent surveys as the workforce becomes comfortable with our inquiries. The ethics committee's most recent survey on the institution's ethical climate, for example, received a response rate close to 25%. Intra-institutional surveys are a very powerful mechanism for open and transparent communication.
