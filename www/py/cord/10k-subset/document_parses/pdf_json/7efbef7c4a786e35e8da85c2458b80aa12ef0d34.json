There is a great need for development of rational ways of detecting and quantifying antibodies, both for humans and animals. Traditionally, serology using synthetic antigens covers linear epitopes using up to 30 amino acid peptides. Methods: We here report that peptides of 100 amino acids or longer (\"megapeptides\"), designed and synthesized for optimal serological performance, can successfully be used as detection antigens in a suspension multiplex immunoassay (SMIA). Megapeptides can quickly be created just from pathogen sequences. A combination of rational sequencing and bioinformatic routines for definition of diagnostically-relevant antigens can, thus, rapidly yield efficient serological diagnostic tools for an emerging infectious pathogen. Results: We designed megapeptides using bioinformatics and viral genome sequences. These long peptides were tested as antigens for the presence of antibodies in human serum to the filo-, herpes-, and polyoma virus families in a multiplex microarray system. All of these virus families contain recently discovered or emerging infectious viruses. Conclusion: Long synthetic peptides can be useful as serological diagnostic antigens, serving as biomarkers, in suspension microarrays.",

Antibody detection (serology) provides a unique possibility to detect past events encountered by the immune system, like an infection or exposure to an antigen mimicking an autoantigen. Nucleic acid detection of a microbe cannot do this, unless the microbe causes an ongoing infection. Moreover, the amplification inherent in the immune response means that antibody detection can be more sensitive than nucleic acid detection. The infecting pathogen is often sequestered in the body and not accessible for sampling, but the antibodies to it are available in blood and can often be readily detected many years after the infection. Thus, nucleic acid and antibody detection go hand in hand for diagnosis and surveillance of many medically important infectious diseases. Antibodies to a pathogen are traditionally detected to one antigen at a time using agent-specific ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays). However, many different antibodies can now be detected simultaneously, e.g., with SMIA (suspension multiplex immunoassay) [7] [8] [9] [10] , a rational and economic technique. SMIA is a cost-effective serological method where antigen and serum consumption can be minimized, its background is generally low, and the dynamic range wider than in ELISA. Unlike the latter, it provides multiple results per analysis [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Antigens for such serological diagnostic systems optimally need to be prepared without any delay. Novel pathogens are now often identified through rapid sequencing [5, 11, 12] . It is then a non-trivial bioinformatic task to identify suitable antigens from the sequence. Such antigens can be produced as recombinant proteins from synthetic nucleic acid, or as synthetic peptides. The ability to re-create the original antigenic structure of the microbial sequence, including both linear and conformational epitopes, generally increases the greater the portion of the antigen that is part of the synthetic construct, in essence, converting linear (one-dimensional) information to three-dimensional. This is the rationale behind the \"megapeptide\" concept described here.",

The peptides were synthesized under optimized conditions for long peptides (Pipkorn, unpublished). Briefly, solid phase synthesis was done on an automated multiple-peptide synthesizer (AMS 422; Abimed Analysen-Technik, Langenfeld, Germany), using coupling times and conditions optimized for high coupling yield. For amino-terminal protection, the base-labile FluorenylMethylOxyCarbonyl chloride (FMOC) group was used. In a few cases, megapeptides were subsequently analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 column.

Briefly, the coupling was made with 200 \u00b5L of the stock microsphere solution containing approximately 1.25\u02c610 7 beads per ml. We have found the optimal quantity of antigen for coupling of 200 \u00b5L of Magplex microsphere suspension to be 5-10 \u00b5g of recombinant protein antigen and 50 \u00b5g of synthetic peptide antigens. However, it is possible to save reagents by using smaller amounts and volumes. All volumes in the recipe should then be decreased proportionally. After the coupling of antigen with beads, beads were incubated with 0.5 mL of PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 50 mM Tris (PBST) in the dark for 15 min on a rocking mixer at room temperature. The purpose of which was to block unreacted carboxyl groups with primary amines. The beads were then washed once with 0.5 mL StabilGuard (SurModics, Eden Prairie, MN, USA, #SG01-1000) using a magnetic separator. The bead pellet was finally resuspended in 400 \u00b5L StabilGuard. This created a bead mixture consisting of 6250 beads/\u00b5L. The coupled beads were stored at 4\u02ddC in the dark. We found that coupled beads could be stored for at least a month (unpublished data). Prolonged storage at 4\u02ddC can create problems due to antigen degradation, bacterial, or fungal growth. The beads with different numbers can be combined to make a serological panel for use in a multiplex system which theoretically could have a maximal multiplexity of 200 at a time. However, this becomes expensive due to antigen and bead costs. In our work, we have stayed at multiplexities below 50.",

Fifty microliters of a vortexed and sonicated bead mixture consisting of 25 beads/\u00b5L suspended in PBSTP was then added to each well. The plate was then incubated in the dark with gentle rotation for 1 h at 37\u02ddC. Post incubation, the wells were washed with PBS using a magnetic plate separator (Novex by Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA #lifetechnologies-A14179). After that, the beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of PBSTP and 50 \u00b5L of biotinylated-protein G (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA, #Pierce-29988) at the concentration of (4 \u00b5g/mL of PBSTP) in each well.

The beads were washed once with PBS before they were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of PBS and analyzed in a Luminex-200 (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) instrument according to the instruction from the manufacturer. A minimum of 100 events for each bead number was set to read and the median value was obtained for the analysis of the data. All samples were analyzed in duplicate and average readings calculated. To detect any antibody binding to the beads themselves, a naked non-peptide-containing (\"blank\") bead was included. A control His 6 bead was also included in the SMIA reaction. The His 6 tag allowed monitoring of coupling of the megapeptides to the magnetic beads using anti-hexahistidine antibodies (Antibodies-online, Atlanta, GA, USA, #ABIN100493). We did not observe false positive reactions due to anti-His 6 in the sera tested for this paper. One negative control, where PBSTP instead of serum was added, was also used in all experiments.

Many new polyomaviruses have been discovered recently and there are currently 13 human polyomaviruses described. Most seem to be apathogenic for humans.

JCV infections in immunosuppressed patients can be particularly serious. Sometimes, the deadly disease progressive multifocal encephalopathy is caused by JCV. It is imperative to create specific serological tools for this and for other important polyomaviruses. The capsid proteins are the major polyomaviral antigens. We therefore synthesized a set of six overlapping VP1 megapeptides from JC virus (Table S1 ). By SMIA, it turned out that the majority of IgG reactions were found against three megapeptides, amino acids 47-148, 103-218 and 252-354 (Figure 4) , where reactivities of seven JCV antibody-positive blood donors are shown. Of the 131 sera, 32 (25%) did not react with an MFI of over 300 against at least one of the megapeptides (Table S3 ). These megapeptides are then antigen candidates for an HHV7 serological panel. Like among the herpesviruses, there are more or less pronounced cross-reactions between the capsid proteins of the polyoma viruses [17] . It is, therefore, reasonable to analyze polyoma antibodies in a \"pan-polyomavirus\" context.

Peptide synthesis of a 200 aa takes 300 h (13 days). They must then be transported and coupled to SMIA beads (one day). After 18 days, i.e., less than three weeks, a multiplex serology with a reasonable chance of detecting antibodies to the emerging microbe could be in place.

Unless the location of highly antigenic epitopes is known or highly likely from analogy with related microbes, it is recommendable to synthesize several, e.g., five different megapeptides. The selection of peptide sequences can be from highly-antigenic surface antigens, predicted epitopes, see e.g., the Immune Epitope Database [13] , or by knowledge of antigenic proteins from related microbes. Our experience, much of which is unpublished, is that (like for any antigen) megapeptides can work more or less well. Limitations seem often to be due to absence of posttranslational modifications, like glycosylation. However, in this paper we give an example of a megapeptide covering a part of the Ebola surface glycoprotein, which retained specific antigenic activity, albeit lower than a longer glycosylated counterpart. Non-glycosylated proteins, like nucleoproteins or capsid proteins, are sometimes excellently mimicked by megapeptides, e.g., for hantavirus antibody detection (manuscript submitted). By using peptides of over 100 amino acids the likelihood that conformational epitopes can be mimicked is increased. It is our experience that shorter peptides (like 30 aa) are less useful for diagnostic serology (illustrated in Table S2 ), emphasizing the need for conformational epitopes for this purpose.",

It is natural that they cannot mimic the antigenicity of the whole molecule. Long recombinant proteins can cover more of the antigenicity. However, megapeptides are simpler to produce and are often cheaper than recombinant proteins on a weight basis. In this paper we could, therefore, use a higher molar concentration of megapeptide than of recombinant protein. From numerous titration experiments with other peptides and megapeptides (unpublished data) we assume that the given conditions for megapeptides are within 50%-100% of the saturation limit of the beads. Like in any immunoassay, the final antigen concentration to be used in an assay ready for routine use must be found by checkerboard titration against suitable antisera.

The use of several antigens for a single microbe can also avoid false negative results due to target antigen variation, unequal timing of immune responses to different antigens during an infection, or genetic differences in immune response to individual antigens. It is also suitable for syndromic or microbial family-based serological panels. The megapeptide is one of several antigen types which can contribute to these applications.",

The megapeptide was coupled at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/reaction while recombinant proteins were coupled at 10 \u00b5g/reaction. Results with dilutions of (A): a rabbit hyperimmune serum to ZrGP; and (B): a serum from a patient previously infected with a filovirus, are shown. Y axes: median fluorescence intensity (MFI). X axes: reciprocal serum dilution. A likely prozone effect was seen at the 1 {2 dilution; (C): relative reactivity (observed vs maximum MFI) for reciprocal dilutions 4-32 of the same patient serum as shown in (B), and for a blood donor serum. All dilutions refer to the 50 \u00b5L of diluted serum which together with the 50 \u00b5L bead panel had a final volume of 100 \u00b5L.
