It is considered the most common zoonosis in the world and is usually transmitted by urine of rodents and dogs with an incubation time of 7-14 days. The clinical spectrum ranges from a subclinical infection to a fulminant septic course. Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a German patient with acute pancreatitis associated with Leptospira interrogans causing fulminant septic shock. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics and left the hospital fully recovered after 18 days. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first case of leptospirosis with acute pancreatitis as the leading clinical manifestation in Central Europe. Serologic and molecular genetic tests for leptospirosis should be considered, if no other causes for pancreatitis can be identified.",

It is considered to be the most common zoonosis worldwide and is usually transmitted from rodents, dogs and cats when an infected animal or an animal's urine comes into contact with broken skin. The incubation time is 7-14 days. Absence of infected skin makes the entry unidentifiable in most cases. The clinical spectrum ranges from a subclinical infection to a fulminant septic course. Typical symptoms are shivering, fever, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion, vomiting and diarrhea. Icteric and unicteric courses are known. Jaundice is considered as a sign of liver dysfunction but can occur without necrosis of the liver. Antibiotic treatment must be initiated early. Most cases of leptospirosis are described from tropical or subtropical regions. In Germany, approximately 60 cases occur each year [1] . Here, we report the case of a German patient, who presented with acute pancreatitis associated with Leptospira interrogans causing fulminant septic shock.",

The abdomen was slightly distended with pain after palpation in the right upper quadrant. Peristaltic sounds were normal. Examination of the heart and the lungs were unremarkable. Conjunctival suffusion was not found. Initial blood analysis revealed leukocytosis (13.2/nl), thrombocytopenia (23/nl) as well as elevated values for C-reactive protein (CRP, 174.6 mg/l), procalcitonin (PCT, 10.0 ng/ml, cutoff < 0.5 ng/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (312 U/l), creatinine (2.95 mg/dl, clearance 20 ml/ min/1.73qm), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 55 U/l), bilirubin (14.9 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 11,72 mg/dl) and lipase (2417 U/l).

Thus, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed 1 day after his primary presentation at the ED. This procedure revealed a normal duodenum, a swollen papilla vateri and only minor spontaneous biliary drainage was observed. Intrahepatic bile ducts and the common hepatic duct were not dilated. While preparing for the endoscopic procedure, the respiratory and hemodynamic condition of the patient worsened. Consequently he was intubated, commenced on a noradrenaline infusion, and the antibiotic treatment was escalated to meropenem.",

The physical examination revealed a slight transient rash of his back. We performed further investigations regarding the etiology of the patient's condition. A stool test for Clostridium difficile antigen was negative. Further sampling by blood cultures, tracheal secretion and urine-analyses showed no growth of any bacteria. A screening for MRSA was negative, as were serologic tests for Hepatits B, Hepatitis C, mumps and Epstein-Barr virus. Acute liver failure with jaundice, hemorrhagic diathesis with purpura and petechiae combined with acute kidney injury accompanied by an odd transient macular, erythematous rash directed to serologic testing for leptospirosis. It revealed strong positive IgG and IgM antibodies. While leptospirosis PCR in the blood was negative, analysis of the tracheal secretion taken during his stay on the ICU revealed the presence of Leptospira interrogans DNA. Urine analysis performed at the same time however remained negative for leptospirosis DNA by PCR. PCR was performed by the Institute of Microbiology and Hygiene of the University of Freiburg, Germany, which is accredited by the DAkkS (Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle, Berlin, Germany) for leptospira PCR for probes of both sterile and non-sterile origin.",

The source of his infection eventually remains unclear. There are two relevant possibilities which appear to be most likely: First, the patient lives with several pets including two cats and a dog, which might have shed leptospires in the urine [2] ; second, he visited a waste deposal site 7 days before his initial presentation at the ED but had never noticed contact with rodents or recognized a bite injury.",

Another case from Greece about a patient from Congo reported pancreatitis in combination with myocarditis, polyarthritis, mononeuritis multiplex and vasculitis with symmetrical peripheral gangrene of the lower extremities [4] . A similar case from Romania was reported in 2013 with necrotizing pancreatitis and severe anemia which required surgical therapy [5] . Some cases with leptospirosis leading to pancreatitis have been described in tropical or subtropical regions [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .

Commonly, pancreatitis does not represent the initial symptom but is rather observed as a concomitant condition, e.g. in patients with ARDS caused by leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is thought to cause systemic vasculitis in which inflammation of the vascular walls may be a consequence of the direct invasion of the infectious agent or of immune mechanisms such as immune complex deposition, auto-antibodies or cell-mediated immunity [19, 21, 22] . The mechanism of acute pancreatitis in leptospirosis still remains unclear; however, activation of proteolytic enzymes and auto-digestion causing ischemic injury and vasculitis is a probable scenario [10] .",
