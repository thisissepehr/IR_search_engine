Traditionally it has been teaching hospital based however general practice rotations may provide greater opportunities than previously thought. Aims: This study aimed to ascertain whether a General Practice setting or a teaching hospital setting provided a better environment for acquiring procedural skills in terms of opportunity to practice and the variety of skills performed. The correlation between end of year OSCE results and the amount of procedural skill exposure was also looked at. Methods: A cross-sectional quantitative study which included all 107 3rd year medical students at UCC was conducted. A log book listing 28 procedural skills was made available to all students before beginning both General practice and teaching hospital rotations. Students were instructed to indicate on the log when they performed any of these skills and in which location. Logs were returned to medical school. Data was obtained and analysis performed using SPSS17. Results: A response rate of 80 % was achieved. 92.9 % of students performed more skills at the GP setting. 40.5 % (n = 34) did not perform any skills while in a teaching hospital 0.17 skills were performed significantly more frequently in a GP setting while 5 were performed more frequently in a teaching hospital. Students who performed a high number of skills in one location were no more likely to perform a high number in the other. Conclusions: Students were able to take greater advantage of procedural skills opportunities in a GP setting. As this was the students first clinical year it is likely that the one-to-one teaching scenario provided them with a more suitable location to practice skills for the first time.

In tandem with breast conser-vative surgery, surgical approaches to the axilla have also become less invasive thus decreasing the morbidity associated with axillary clearance. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial reported no difference in survival in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in T1-T2 tumours. Our aims were to establish whether sentinel lymph node biopsy was a true representative of axillary burden. We also analysed whether retrospective application of criteria from Z0011 trial would have prevented patients undergoing second axillary surgery. Methods: All patients with T1-T2 tumours undergoing sentinel node biopsy were included in our study (n = 1019). Analysis of our prospectively updated breast cancer database was performed. Minitab version 16.0 was used to carry out statistical analysis of the data Results: 1019 SLNB procedures for T1 & T2 tumours were performed over a 7 year period. 730 patients were reported as histologically negative and 289 were positive. Of the lymph node positive group, 223 patients progressed to axillary clearance. Staging of 149 patients remained unchanged with only 74 patients having [2 axillary lymph nodes reported as positive. 72 patients from the SLNB negative group also had an axillary clearance. 5 of these patients had further axillary disease with 1 patient being upstaged having [2 axillary lymph nodes positive. With retrospective application of Z0011 criteria 66 % of patients would have avoided second axillary surgery. Conclusions: Sentinel node biopsy is a strong indicator of axillary tumour burden.

Background: Out of hospital cardiac arrests have poor survival rates approx 1-9 %. Improving outcomes in Ireland have been seen in the past decade. Better outcomes are seen if arrest is witnessed and when bystander Basic Life Support was initiated. Worse prognosis is seen in a rural setting due to delay in paramedic response times and in administration of advanced cardiac life support. Case report: A 60-year-old Donegal Male experienced chest pain in his rural home and subsequently cardiac arrested. His spouse, whom 3 months prior had trained in Basic Life Support as part of a FAS course contacted the 'out of hours' GP and Ambulance service and commenced CPR. The GP failed to reach the house and the first ambulance broke down. On arrival of second ambulance, one person CPR had been administered for [40 min.

Older patients have lower lean muscle mass and therefore using serum creatinine alone as marker of renal function can lead to underdiagnosis of CKD. Objective: The aim of this study was to review the prevalence of CKD amongst a cohort of elderly patients with normal serum creatinine. Methods: Doctot application on the smartphone was used to calculate eGFR in a cohort of patients over 65 years with a normal serum creatinine on admission. 40 patients were included. This application is based on the MDRD formula (includes age, sex, ethnicity and serum creatinine). Patients were then classed into the various stages of CKD. Results: Of the 40 patients reviewed, 35 had renal disease. Interestingly, only 5 had a diagnosis of renal impairment recorded in the medical notes. 20 of the 35 patients had stage 1 CKD and the other 15 had stage 2 CKD. 18 of the 35 patients with renal impairment especially stage 2, were found to be frail females over 75 years. This group also had a number of co-morbidities including diabetes and hypertension. Conclusion: eGFR is better than serum creatinine alone for assessment of renal function in the elderly. It is important not only for diagnosis but also for appropriate medical investigation and drug prescribing. As the MDRD formula excludes BMI, further research is warranted to compare measurement of eGFR using MDRD formula with The Cockcroft and Gault equation in this older population.

Introduction: Waiting times can exceed 100 days for general surgical clinics and can reach up to 18 months in different surgical specialities. Many outpatient slots are lost by patients who do not attend (DNA) to their scheduled appointment. We sought to ascertain whether a reminder text message (RTM) could decrease the number of patients who DNA to surgical outpatients. Methods: A single text message was sent to patients 4 days before their scheduled appointment, reminding them of the date and time of their upcoming surgical outpatient visit. This incentive was initiated in January 2011. Outpatient appointment scheduling and attendances for a single surgical team were analysed over a 1 year period, encompassing two 6 month periods before and after implementation of the RTM service. Data was exported to SPSS v17 for statistical analysis with p \\ 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: Over the 12 month period there were 1,287 scheduled outpatient appointments for the surgical service, with 653 attending prior to the implementation of the reminder text message service and the remaining 634 attending in the 6 months following its implementation.

Ca ++ CO 3 with vit. D 3 was prescribed for 55 % of patients on systemic steroids with 20 % also receiving BP therapy. Creation and circulation of hospital guidelines resulted in an improvement in the co-prescription of Ca ++ CO 3 and vit. D 3 and BP's with GC's by the order of 2.35 and 10 respectively. However 45 % of patients on systemic steroids received no bone protection and 80 % received suboptimal bone protection from steroid induced osteoporosis. Conclusion: Publication and advertisement of current bone protection guidelines when prescribing systemic steroids resulted in a substantial but suboptimal improvement by hospital doctors in our hospital in the co-prescription of bone protecting drugs to prevent steroid induced osteoporosis. In this audit it appears that the majority of prescribers do recognise the necessity to protect bone health when a patient requires steroids. However a substantial number of patients did not receive any bone protection. It is our perception that most physicians are not aware that short courses of steroids reduce bone mineral density and therefore greater efforts must be made to enhance doctor awareness of the necessity for bone protection to be prescribed at initiation of systemic steroids. There is a trend towards longer total survival for Jetflow TCVCs.

To assess the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with known AF attending an Irish General Practice (IGP) and use of stratification schemes to assess their suitability for oral anticoagulant therapy. Methods and subject: Permission to carry out the study was sort from University-College-Dublin ethics committee. There were 161 patients with AF attending the IGP identified using the computerized disease coding system WHO International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). Thirty patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2009 and 21/01/2011 and their data from the computerized medical notes was used to calculate CHADS 2 , CHA2DS 2 -VASc, HAS-BLED scores and identify antithrombotic therapy they were using. Results: There were 30 AF patients. Sixty-three percent (n = 19) were males and 37 % (n = 11) were females (ratio 1.7:1). Twentythree percent (n = 7) of patients were aged \\65 years, 27 % (n = 8) 65-74 years inclusive and 50 % (n = 15) =/[75 years. Two patients with CHADS 2 score zero were on warfarin although one of them had CHA 2 DS 2 VASc Score of one. Sixty-percent (n = 18) were on warfarin alone, 20 % (n = 6) aspirin alone, 14 % (n = 4) warfarin plus aspirin, 3 % (n = 1) aspirin plus clopidogrel and 3 % (n = 1) on warfarin plus clopidogrel. Seven patients were not on warfarin for various reasons. The HAS-BLED score revealed 7 patients at low risk, 12 moderate risk and 11 at high risk of bleeding. Implications: Ninety-three percent of patients were correctly managed and two patients were on warfarin with CHADS 2 scores of zero.

The patient list was derived from a database of patients collated by the gynaecological services at SJH of all patients who received workup and treatment for cervical cancer from 2006-2011. The computer system at SJH was employed for analysing PET-CT reports and histology reports. Microsoft excel was used to store this information parameters and complete statistics on the data. Results: The results of this study are to follow. Conclusion: There is a correlation between FDG avidity and histological subtype of cervical cancer and this provides valuable information on the reliability of PET-CT findings in a specific cohort of patients with cervical cancer. We present the case of a 44-year-old male with a primary piriform fossa squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who attended for staging Positron Emission Tomography/Computerised Tomography (PET/ CT) scan. Distant to the primary lesion, focused F 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was noted in the left iliac bone, without underlying abnormality on the accompanying CT scan. Low grade uptake was also noted in subcentimetre upper mediastinal nodes, without any underlying lung parenchymal abnormality. These nodes were felt to be inflammatory or reactive in origin. Though an unusual pattern for metastatic head and neck SCC, the left iliac bone lesion was concerning for malignancy. Thus, a percutaneous biopsy of this region was performed under image guidance. Histology revealed non caseating epithelioid granulomata consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient was subsequently able to have potentially curative treatment of his head and neck primary. Discussion: Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory multisystem condition characterised by the presence of non-caseating granulomas in affected organ tissues. It commonly affects young and middle aged adults with a slightly higher prevalence in women. The disease shows a predilection for adults under 40, peaking between 20 and 29, with a second peak in women over 50 [1] . Despite its unknown aetiology, it is felt that T lymphocytes play a central role in the development of sarcoidosis, as they likely propagate an excessive cellular immune reaction. It has been shown that abnormalities with the CD4/CD8 ratio and production of T helper 1 and 17 (Th 1/Th 17) cytokines such as interferon and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) are found in sites of disease activity [2] . The importance of TNF in sarcoidosis is demonstrated by the efficacy of anti-TNF medications such as pentoxifylline and infliximab [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2116, "end": 2119, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2512, "end": 2515, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2649, "end": 2652, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Poster 38"}, {"text": "It is estimated that bone lesions occur in 1-13 % of sarcoidosis patients [4] .

Recent guidelines published by the EORTC-EANM have defined specific criteria with relation to performing lymphoscintigraphy in melanoma patients. Methods: The aim of this study was to audit all patients with malignant melanoma who underwent Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNBx) and lymphoscintigraphy in University College Hospital Galway between 2005-2010. Results were compared with EORTC-EANM recommendations. Results: 189 melanoma patients underwent SLNBx during the study period. 121 patients had preoperative lymphoscintigraphy using intradermal injections of technetium 99 m. Sentinel nodes were identified in 102 of 121 patients (84.3 %) on lymphoscintigraphy. 66.94 % of lymphoscintigrams were reported on the same day as the procedure, 23.97 % after 1 day and 9.09 % greater than 1 day postop. Obligatory imaging, as defined in the EORTC-EANM guidelines, was obtained in 91 % of all patients undergoing lymphoscintigraphy. No nodal uptake was reported in 18 patients, 14 of whom received imaging in accordance with the guidelines. The location of those melanomas with no nodal uptake was 44.4 % on the head and neck, and 38.9 % on the trunk. The overall rate of false-negative lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy was 5.2 %. In patients receiving lymphoscintigraphy the false negative rate was 3.7 versus 7.9 % in patients who did not have lymphoscintigraphy. Conclusion: Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is an essential adjunct in identifying the sentinel lymph node in clinically node negative melanoma patients and should adhere to EORTC-EANM guidelines. Conflict of interest: None. On examination, she was alert, HR 160, BP 105/60. She was tachypnoeic, but reported this to be her baseline. There was a palpable, non-reducible mass in the left upper quadrant. A chest X-ray showed loops of bowel above the diaphragm. Ultrasound showed an abscess in the rectus sheath, which drained mucopurulent fluid.MB opted not to have the diaphragm repaired, despite medical advice. She was readmitted 2 weeks later with a recurrence of the abscess. Her clinical condition deteriorated, with severe abdominal pain, and oxygen saturations of 70 %. An emergency laparotomy was performed, which showed an obstructing lesion in the descending colon, with large and small bowel above the diaphragm. She had an extended right hemicolectomy, with restoration of bowel to the abdominal cavity and mesh repair of the diaphragm. Histology showed an descending colon adenocarcinoma, T3N0M0.Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is a rare problem, occurring in 1-8 % of blunt and penetrating traumas. (1) Plain films and CT scans are not always diagnostic in the acute phase, due to concomitant injuries. (2) Repair is essential once diagnosis has been reached to avoid herniation of abdominal viscera. Patients with ongoing dyspnoea after blunt trauma may benefit from a repeat chest X-ray.

Clinical examination showed a right side neck mass approximately 7 cm 9 5 cm in size which extended through both anterior and posterior triangles. Cervical lymphadenopathy was not appreciated and the patient was clinically euthyroid. Patient was admitted under the care of the maxillofacial service, where he underwent a needle core biopsy of the neck mass. This was returned showing poorly differentiated spindle cell tumour with large pleomorphic nuclei and abundant abnormal mitoses. The immunoprofile was consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated sarcomatoid carcinoma and the differential diagnosis included origin fro the kidney, lung or thyroid.The case was discussed at the Head and Neck MDM and a consensus was reached that the patient as developed a sarcoma of the neck, with a level 5 neck dissection the most appropriated intervention.Intraoperatively, following the removal of the neck mass it was noted that the right lobe of the thyroid was enlarged. An intra-op FNA was performed on the mass in the right lobe of the thyroid. The FNA was returned showing bizarre giant cells, suggestive of malignancy. Ultimately the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy but, despite surgery the patient died 19 weeks post-operatively. Using feedback from the pilot study and analysis of the preexamination Consultant and Registrar-led teaching schedule for students a further 'Intern-led' tutorial timetable was structured. It allowed for a weekly maximum of 9 h of teaching dependent on demand and intern availability. Programme duration was 10 weeks, January to March 2012. Group sizes were a maximum of 8 students. Tutorials were all at the patient bedside. Feedback forms were distributed at the end of the programme.Sixty-four tutorials were given in total. Seventy feedback forms were returned. Mean number of tutorials attended per student was 5.8. Students rated statements 1-5 (1-Strongly Disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-Neutral, 4-Agree, 5-Strongly Agree). Median scores were used. Scoring showed improvements were made from last year in terms of level of intern preparation for tutorials and importantly, the students own subjective view of their level of preparation for forthcoming examinations. Most importantly, students agreed that tutorials improved their history taking skills and strongly agreed that their examination skills improved. Matching feedback from the pilot study, students strongly agreed that intern-led teaching is an appropriate adjunct to the final year programme.Of the 47 Intern working in St James's Hospital, 22 participated. Seventeen of these had received tutorials on the pilot programme. Of the 25 that did not participate, many had never received formal intern teaching.The feedback obtained from the pilot study was invaluable in organising and delivering this teaching programme.
