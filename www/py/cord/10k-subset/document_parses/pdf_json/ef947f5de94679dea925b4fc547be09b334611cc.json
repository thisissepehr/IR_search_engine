Segmental internodal primary demyelination was found in almost 90 % of the dogs from 27 days post inoculation (DPI). Ultrastructurally demyelination was initiated by the insertion of CDV-infected astrocytic processes at nodes of Ranvier with subsequent cleavage of well-preserved myelin from the axolemma. CDV-infected macrophages were consistently involved in myelin phagocytosis. Some remyelination of denuded axons occurred after 35 DPI. Persistent productive infection of the choroid plexus and ependyma in the fourth ventricle was consistently associated with subependymal foci of demyelination.",

In our laboratory manipulation of the canine model for CDV-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis by inoculation at 21 days of age rather than at 4-8 weeks [9] has resulted in a much higher incidence of consistent demyelinating lesions in the rostral medullary velum (RMV) (R. J. Higgins et al., unpublished data 1980) . This finding has thus enhanced the potential usefulness of this model for sequential morphologic and immunologic studies designed to critically evaluate the temporal role of both viral and immune factors in vivo. The first objective of this study therefore was to examine the sequential histologic and ultrastructural morphogenesis of the earliest lesions leading to primary demyelination in the RMV and to correlate these changes with the presence of any viral antigen or immunoglobulin 0001-6322/82/0058/0001/$1.60 deposits within these sites. The second aim was to interpret these findings in relation to parallel sequential studies to detect any CDV-associated humoral immune responses.",

The earliest ultrastructural change in morphologically intact myelinated axons was the insertion of nucleocapsid-bearing astrocytic cell processes onto nodes of Ranvier between intact paranodal areas and their subsequent attachment to the exposed axolemma at 24 DPI (Fig. 4) . This attachment zone did not always completely encircle the node. At 27 DPI in segmentally demyelinated axons, these cell processes initially inserted under the myelin paranodal-axonal junction and then extended between the axolemmae and overlying myelin lamellae, with relative preservation of the separated myelin sheath. Vacuolar intramyelinic lamellar separation did not occur around axons undergoing cell-mediated segmental internodal stripping of the myelin sheath. Tight junctions between astrocytic cell processes were often found. Also by 27 DPI nucleocapsid-containing actively phagocytic cells surrounded many demyelinated but intact axons. Their elongate nuclei often had multiple indentations and uniformly dispersed abundant heterochromatin. The dense, dark staining cytoplasm contained abundant rough endoplasmic reticu-lum, multiple dusters of lamellar myelin-like profiles, lipid inclusions, granular debris and prominent lysosomes but no filaments or microtubules. These cells surrounded single intact denuded axonal segments while neighboring adjacent myelinated axons were intact. Sometimes these cells were between other naked axons (Fig. 5) . Although infected hypertrophic astrocytes containing glial filaments were adjacent to myelinated or demyelinated axons, these cells did not have evidence of phagocytosis of myelin before 35 DPI.

Subsequent disruption of paranodal junctions of relatively intact myelin by these underunning processes suggests a primary role for infected astrocytes in the initial demyelinating processes. Although these early changes have not been reported, phagocytosis of myelin lamellae by astrocytes in CDV-induced demyelination has been recognised previously in both spontaneous [23] and experimental studies [26] .

Our morphologic interpretation however would be consistent with a mechanism of intracellular protease-induced myelinolysis following CDV-induced macrophage fusion with in~ dividual oligodendroglia or their membranes. In our study, such a non-specific bystander mechanism of myelin injury would not be dependent on any antiviral humoral response [31] .

Although CDV infection of oligodendroglia is rare [23, 27] and was not recognized in this study, a non-cytolytic infection of these cells could result in this pattern of demyelination. This pattern is similar to that of experimental coronavirus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis in mice where virusinduced cytolysis of oligodendroglia results in primary segmental demyelination [29] . It contrasts sharply with the multifocal, irregular lysis of myelin lamellae and primary demyelination with perivenular mononuclear cell infiltrates characteristic [18] of experimentally-induced autoimmune-mediated acute [17] and chronic [25] experimental allergic encephalitis. The finding in our dogs of inappropriately thin internodal myelin sheaths of uniform thickness that terminated in normal paranodal complexes fulfill the established criteria for remyelination within the CNS [22] . Thus, the presence of remyelination after 35 DPI implies a capacity for functional restoration of injured oligodendroglia or remyelination from other intact oligodendroglia as in corona virus infection in mice where remyelination occurs as early as 24-28 DPI [30] .",

This data, with the absence of CDV antibody in serum or CSF and lack of detectable immunoglobulin deposits or immunocompetent cells in the lesions, indicates that it is highly unlikely CDV-VN antibody-dependent mechanisms are involved in initial primary demyelination.",

In the one dog with terminally detected serum CDV antibody activity, a similar antibodyinduced modulation may explain the additional unique demyelinating lesions in the cerebral hemispheric white matter. However, in this dog there was no discernable difference in the severity and focal nature of the demyelinating lesions in other sites compared with those of the three seronegative dogs.

Direct CDV-induced injury appears to play a major role in initiation of the primary demyelination. The absence of specific CDV antibody in these dogs with multifocal demyelinating lesions suggests that the genesis of initial primary demyelination in CDV-induced encephalomyelitis at this age occurs, independently of both direct and indirect humoral antiviral immune mechanisms.",
