No central airways deposition of Technegas was seen in patients in either study, and a static distribution of radiotracer was seen for 20 rain post inhalation, thus providing adequate time for single photon emission tomography (SPET) acquisition or multiple planar views. In a study of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, the accuracy of Technegas ventilation scans was compared with 133Xe images and also the accuracy of ventilation/ perfusion scanning using Technegas and 99mTc-macroaggregates of albumin (MM) MAA was compared with pulmonary angiography. Technegas had a comparable accuracy to ~ 33Xe imaging. There was also an excellent correlation between ventilation perfusion images using Technegas and 99mTc-MAA and the results of pulmonary angiography (Rimkus and Ashburn 1990) .

Patients referred for ventilation/perfusion scanning or pulmonary angiography within 24 h of a suspected pulmonary embolism were included. Of 5587 possible patients considered in the study period from January 1985 to September 1986, 933 patients were included. Posterior view ventilation scans were performed with 133Xe\" Left posterior oblique and right posterior oblique views were also obtained during the washout. Eight view perfusion studies were performed using 99mTc-MAA. Ventilation/perfusion scans were interpreted according to predetermined criteria by two readers from out-side the centre, and a third party adjudication was used for diagreements between observers. Pulmonary angiography was interpreted similarly. The intent of the study was to carry out pulmonary angiography in all patients following ventilation/perfusion scanning, but in fact this was carried out in only 755 patients. The follow-up was by telephone for up to 12 months after the investigation, and an outcome classification was obtained for 902 (97%) of the participants. The greatest agreement between scan readers was seen in the high probability, very low probability and normal categories (_> 92%). Lower agreement was obtained for patients with intermediate or indeterminate probability scans (75%) and low probability categories. Pulmonary angiography agreement was 92% for the presence of pulmonary embolism, 83% for the absence of pulmonary embolism and 89% for those in the uncertain category. The sensitivity of a high probability scan for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was 41%, with a specificity of 97%. Combining the high and intermediate probability scans, the sensitivity was increased to 82%, but this was associated with a fall in specificity for the diagnosis to 52%.",

A past history of pulmonary embolism reduced the positive predictive value of a high probability scan from 88 of 97 patients (91%) with no prior history to 14 of 19 patients (74%) with a prior history. 4. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism in cases of near normal or normal perfusion scans -is very low, 5 of 128 patients (4%). 5. An intermediate or indeterminate probability scan (the largest single category) was not diagnostic; it had a positive predictive value of 33% (104 of 345 patients). If combined with a high pretest clinical probability assessment, its diagnostic value was increased. 6. The presence of emboli in the low probability group was demonstrated in 39/238 of those who had undergone angiography (a further 74 patients did not have angiograms) and in 5/55 with near normal/normal scans (a further 76 patients in this group did not undergo angiography).",

Because of the dangers implicit in clinicians equating low probability with \"no probability\" of pulmonary embolism, some centres now advocate that scans should only be interpreted as being high probability, normal, or non-diagnostic (Moser 1990 ). On the other hand, of the 170 patients in the PIOPED study who had low probability, normal or near normal scans, approximately 10% would have been predicted to have emboli. None of these patients received anticoagulant therapy, and none had clinical events. The question is then raised: in this group is there a need to anticoagulate and are the \"emboli\" detected on angiography clinically relevant? The conclusions that can be drawn from the studies are that the probability of a correct diagnosis is high for the high probability, normal and low probability scans. However, as in most studies 30%-40% of patients have indeterminate scans and since there are risks associated with anticoagulation, this group should be targeted for a further test, either angiography or impedance plethysmography (Hull et al. 1989 ). The size of the group may be reduced by treating those patients with a high pretest clinical suspicion of disease.",

Patients with large bullae and co-existing CAFL may derive functional benefit from plication or excision of the bullae. The prediction of the likelihood of benefit is difficult if ventilation/perfusion imaging shows that the bullae are ventilated but not perfused (i.e. dead space). This is an indication for surgery. In reality, bullae are rarely significantly ventilated or perfused. Nevertheless, ventilation/perfusion imaging is useful since it provides an estimate of the regional ventilation/perfusion relationships within the lung as a whole, and also if the lung around the bullae is well ventilated and perfused, then removal of the tense bullae may allow any compressed healthy tissue to regain its physiological function. 3.

Thirdly, well-defined receptor systems exist on known populations of tissue cells. Evidence from animal studies suggests that infection may be imaged within a few minutes of injection of this tracer . Exciting possibilities exist for the future.

Changing the charge on the molecule alters the transfer and permits the assessment of the degree of damage due to different lung pathologies (Barrowcliffe et al. 1990) . Most of the studies that examined lung permeability have used 99mTc-DTPA, which has a monoexponential removal pattern from the airspace. This rate of clearance is faster in smokers than non-smokers, indicating an increased lung permeability (Minty et al. 1987) .",

This group also demonstrated that one of the problems with using single probes for this measurement is to make the repositioning of the probe over the lung field of interest and over the heart reproducible, which is necessary for the measurement. The method generally in use is adapted from that of Gorin (Gorin et al. 1978 (Gorin et al. , 1980 and measures the accumulation of 113mIn-transferrin in a lung region and compares this with the 99mTC blood pool marker in the same region and over the heart (acting as the blood pool marker). The studies have mainly been confined to conditions associated with dramatic endothelial leak, i.e. adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Basran et al. 1985; Braude et al. 1985) , but more recently have included patients with less clear-cut endothelial problems including those on haemodialysis (Rocker et al. 1987 ) and those who have received radiotherapy to the lungs (Campbell et al. 1991) . The problem with the method arises from the use of two differing radionuclides of widely discrepant energies with variable cross-talk and the possible varying attenuation in the highly abnormal lung studies (which with increasing oedema will undoubtedly be changing). It is also possible that the accumulation of transferrin is a result of direct uptake into migrating neutrophils; these difficulties have yet to be resolved.",

A degree of contrast is observed because the F D G uptake in the lung parenchyma and mediastinal structures is fairly low compared with tumours. PET allows metabolic-dependent imaging, and a quantitative analysis of the tracer uptake can be used to classify the etabolic activity of a tumour. This information may be used in direct correlation with morphological information from CT scanning. K n o p has shown (Knop et al. 1989) an intense uptake of F D G in a tumour 60 rain post injection. This may permit the reliable differentiation of malignant from benign lesions. In a study comparing F D G PET and CT, PET correctly identified 53 of 54 malignant lesions and l0 of 11 benign lesions.
