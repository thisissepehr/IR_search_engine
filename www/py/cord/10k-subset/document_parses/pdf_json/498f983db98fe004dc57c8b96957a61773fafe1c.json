To learn about the outcomes In-stent restenosis (ISR) is a major problem following stenting for femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease. Treatments include standard plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) with or without repeat stenting (bare-metal stents, stentgrafts or drug-eluting stents), drug-eluting or cutting balloon angioplasty, cryoplasty and directional or laser atherectomy. The concept of atherectomy is to debulk the occlusive tissue in the stent before performing adjunctive balloon angioplasty and/or stenting to minimise and delay target limb revascularisation (TLR). Technical success reported with this technique is high, with a significant improvement in clinical symptoms. Shammas et al., in a retrospective study of 41 patients using the Silver-Hawk device (SA), showed technical success in 100% of patients. Compared with baseline, ABI at 1 month significantly improved to 0.91\u00b10.19 (Pb 0.05); however, this was not statistically different at 1 year (0.61\u00b10.28). Adverse events were reported: distal embolization (DE) requiring treatment 7.3%, stent thrombosis 4.9% and planned minor amputation in the non-index limb 2.4%. There were no device-related complications, death or amputation. Schmidt et al. used Excimer laser atherectomy (ELA) to perform a prospective, multicentre study of 90 patients with ISR of nitinol stents and demonstrated that ELA combined with POBA resulted in 97% procedural success, 7% residual stenosis, 2.2% 30-day major complication rate and 64% 1-year freedom from TLR. Another small study in 29 patients using the jet stream and rotational and aspiration system has demonstrated favourable results. Treated length was 19.5\u00b112.9 cm. The device success was reported in 76%, with an overall success of 91%. There was 9.4% embolisation requiring treatment, 3% major bleeding and 3% mortality. Patency was 72% at 6 months, and TLR was 41% at 12 months. A recent multicentre randomised trial of atherectomy and POBA vs. POBA alone showed a significant benefit using atherectomy. A total of 169 atherectomy+POBA patients (62.7% male; mean age 68.5\u00b19.8 years) and 81 POBA patients (61.7% male; mean age 67.8\u00b110.3 years) were enrolled. Mean lesion length was 19.6\u00b112.0 cm versus 19.3\u00b111.9 cm, and 30.5% versus 36.8% of patients exhibited total occlusion. Atherectomy combined with angioplasty demonstrated better procedural success (93.5% vs. 82.7%; p<0.01), with significantly fewer procedural complications. At 6 months, freedom from TLR was 73.5% versus 51.8% (p<0.005) and 30-day major adverse event rates were 5.8% versus 20.5% (p<0.001), with a 52% reduction in TLR (hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.74). There have been few comparative studies comparing different types of atherectomy devices. ELA was utilized more frequently than SH in longer lesions (210.46104 vs. 126.2679.3 mm, respectively; p<0.001), subacute presentation (55% vs. 14.6%, p<0.001), TASC D lesions (47.5% vs. 12.2%), and patients with more angiographic thrombus (42.5% vs. 4.9%, p<0.001). Final angiographic success (30% residual narrowing post-final treatment) was similar between ELA and SH (92.5% vs. 100%, respectively, p<0.12). Bailout stenting was significantly higher with ELA than that with SH (50.0% vs. 24.4%, p<0.022).",

            "text": "To investigate how heating produces changes in liver stiffness, we designed a two-phase ex-vivo experimental study. A homogenously heated sample of ex vivo bovine liver tissue was used in the first phase of the experiments to reduce causes of variability in the measurements and precisely investigate the relationship between temperature and stiffness changes, as quantified using SWV. In the second phase, a sample of liver tissue was heated with a microwave (MW) antenna to reproduce in the laboratory a situation similar to clinical practice. The first phase of the study was aimed to (1) quantify the temperature dependence of liver tissue stiffness, as measured using SWV, (2) identify the threshold value of SWV related to coagulation, (3) assess the reproducibility of this measurement and (4) evaluate the irreversibility of stiffness changes. The second phase was aimed to (1) confirm the SWV threshold for coagulated tissue stiffness during MW ablation and (2) determine the reliability of probes are planned on the 2D and 3D reconstructions of the CT data in order to cover the whole tumor volume by overlapping necroses. Once the trajectory is planned, the path of the probe in the patient can be visualized virtually and changed according to the anatomy of the patient. The trajectories for the different RFA probes are optimized to a distance of approximately 2cm. After sterile washing and draping, registration is performed by indicating the skin fiducials on the patient with the navigation probe, thereby assigning each fiducial its corresponding position on the reconstructed 3D dataset. Thereafter, an aiming device is attached to the fixation system and adjusted using the navigation system for every path. One after another, coaxial needles are advanced through the adjusted aiming device to the pre-planned depth, as indicated by the navigation system. Every needle placement is performed with respiratory triggering. For verification of correct needle placement, a native CT with the needles in place is obtained with respiratory triggering and the dataset superimposed to the plan. After verification of correct needle placement by means of image fusion, a maximum of three RFA probes with an active tip of 3cm are introduced into the coaxial needles to a pre-planned depth. Thereafter, the coaxial needles are retracted in order to avoid contact of the active uninsulated tip of the RFA probe with the coaxial needle. After removal of the ablation probes, a contrast-enhanced CT scan is obtained. The control CT scan is superimposed on the planning CT scan in order to verify complete ablation of the tumor, including the safety margin. Accuracy of stereotactic needle (probe) placement in the phantom Accurate needle placement is crucial for the success of percutaneous radiological needle interventions. Wallach et al. [6] compared three guiding methods using an optical navigation system: freehand, using a stereotactic aiming device and active depth control, and using a stereotactic aiming device and passive depth control. For each method, 25 punctures were performed on a non-rigid phantom. Five 1-mm metal screws were used as targets. The lateral error was significantly lower when an aiming device was used (2.3\u00b11.3-2.8\u00b11.6mm with an aiming device vs. 4.2\u00b12.0mm without). Accuracy of stereotactic needle (probe) placement in the patient Schullian et al. [7] evaluated the targeting accuracy of CT-guided stereotactic liver punctures of primary and secondary liver tumors. The median lateral error was 2.5mm (range: 0-6.5mm) at the needle entry point and 3.2mm (range: 0.01-9.4mm) at the needle tip. The median angular error was 1.06\u00b0 (range: 0\u00b0-6.64\u00b0). Beyer et al. [8] compared stereotactic IRE (SIRE) needle placement with non-navigated conventional IRE (CIRE) for percutaneous ablation of liver malignancies in a total of 20 patients. Accuracy of needle placement for SIRE was higher than that for CIRE (2.2mm vs. 3 .3mm mean deviation, P<0.001). SIRE demonstrated a significantly higher accuracy compared with CIRE. Clinical results after stereotactic thermal ablation Colorectal liver metastases Large colorectal liver metastases can be effectively treated by SRFA. Our group reported 98 SRFA treatment sessions of 189 CRLMs in 63 consecutive patients [9] . LR was identified in 16% of the tumors (31/189), with no significant differences (P=0.635) when comparing the tumor sizes <3cm (17.7%), 3-5cm (11.1%) , and >5cm (17.4%) . Using SRFA, the overall survival (OS) is not affected by tumor size. SRFA achieves overall and disease-free survival (DFS) rates similar to surgical resection. The median OS from SRFA treatment was 33.2 months after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range 2-66); the corresponding 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 87%, 44%, and 27%, respectively. The median OS was significantly different when comparing unresectable and resectable patients (27 vs. 58 months, P=0 .002) with OS rates of 92%, 66%, and 48% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, in resectable patients. Tumor size did not affect OS and DFS. Due to the favorable outcome, SRFA challenges resection as the first-line local treatment of patients with CRLM. Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas Seventeen inoperable consecutive patients with 52 ICCs were treated with SRFA [10] . A median OS of 60 months was achieved. The two largest tumors with diameters >10cm were completely ablated. These SRFA data of irresectable ICCs are superior to the published data on resection. SRFA is a minimally invasive alternative to resection and may be considered as the first-line local treatment for selected patients with ICCs. Metastatic melanoma to the liver In a recent paper, we reported the results after SRFA: 20 patients with 75 melanoma liver metastases [11] . A median number of 2 lesions (range: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] per patient, with a median size of 1.7cm (range: 0. 5-14.5cm ), were treated. Overall, 67 lesions were <3cm (89.3 %) and 8 lesions were >3cm (10.7 %) . Per patient, a median of 1 ablation session was performed (range: [1] [2] [3] [4] , totaling to 34 sessions. There were no procedure-related deaths and all major complications (n=3) could be easily treated by pleural drainages. The primary and secondary success rates were 89.3% and 93.3 %, respectively. The overall local recurrence rate was 13.3%. Four of ten local recurrences were re-treated successfully by SRFA. During follow-up, 9/20 patients developed extrahepatic metastatic disease and 10/20 had liver recurrence at any location. The median OS from the date of SRFA was 19.3 months, with an OS of 64%, 41%, and 17 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, with no significant difference between patients with cutaneous and ocular melanoma. The median DFS after SRFA for all 20 patients was 9.5 months, with 37%, 9%, and 0 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. We concluded that due to the high local curative potential and the promising long-term survival rates associated with minimal morbidity and mortality, RFA seems to be an attractive alternative to resection in patients with melanoma liver metastases. Focal liver lesions in pediatric patients SRFA may even be a good alternative to surgical resection of focal liver lesions in pediatric patients with inherited metabolic disorders [12] . SRFA was successfully applied for the removal of single large liver adenomas in a 22-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with glycogen storage disease type Ia and of a suspicious lesion in a 16-year-old girl with tyrosinemia type I and \u03b1-fetoprotein elevation.",

            "text": "The application of 3D planning, fusion, and navigation techniques can significantly improve the results of thermal ablation. The local recurrence rates and survival rates after SRFA are comparable to those after resection. Therefore, SRFA challenges resection as the first-line local treatment for patients with primary and secondary liver tumors. C RSE Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) provides additional information for the immediate detection of residual viable tumor areas [9] but is not routinely performed in all institutions. Contrast-enhanced CT provides an accurate assessment of the ablation zone but is not immediate because the patient must be transferred in the CT suite and targeting requires increased dose deposition. Moreover, when tumors are isoechoic and/or located in the liver dome, tumor targeting can be difficult. Image fusion and navigation technologies were applied to improve US detection and attempt a bridge between co-registration of realtime US with CT, MRI, and/or PET volumetric scans. However, as described by Lim et al [10] , mistargeting may occur in case of peripheral tumor location due to the fact that stable anatomic landmarks (e.g., large vessels) are more remote and thus more difficult to use for locating the tumor. Liver deformation due to device insertion or patient positioning and displacement by the patient's breathing motion or heartbeat may be more apparent in the peripheral liver than in the central liver. This affects the accuracy of the co-registration between pre-acquired tomographic images and real-time US. The lack of direct assessment of ablation device positioning and consequent ablation zone with the techniques described has driven the exploration of the value of CBCT imaging, either as a primary image guidance modality or to augment US-guided liver tumor ablation. Therefore, CBCT has been proposed as an alternative technique in this setting for real-time needle guidance, sometimes associated with fusion imaging. Morimoto et al [4] performed CBCT angiography following injection of a bolus of contrast into the proper hepatic artery. 3D images were post-processed and registered on fluoroscopic images. On the basis of software manipulations, the authors automatically calculated the best needle path by indicating both the skin entry point and the center of the target lesion. The software also computed the necessary C-arm angulation for real-time visualization of the progression of the needle along the virtual path on the fluoroscopic images. A technical success rate of 100% was reported [4] .",

            "text": "In others studies, unenhanced CBCT and similar post-processing software for targeting was used, reporting a high technical success [8] . Assessment of the ablation zone and margins (at least 5 mm) represents the primary outcome after an ablation procedure to ensure tumor coverage. The most common risk factors for local tumor progression are tumor size, proximity to a major vessel, subcapsular location, and an insufficient ablative safety margin [11, 12] . The latter factor seems to play a major role because significant agreement (86.8%) was found between the exact sites of local tumor progression and an insufficient ablative margin [13] . Some studies have hypothesized that CBCT could be used to assess effective ablation and be an interesting alternative to MDCT in combination with US, especially in centers in which CT is not immediately available. Interventional radiology image acquisition requires intravenous injection of the contrast agent and synchronized acquisitions of CBCT after a delay similar to CT during portal venous or delayed phases (60-120 s) . Iwazawa et al compared periprocedural CBCT and MDCT performed 3-7 days after the procedure and reported a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 96.4%, respectively, for detecting insufficient safety margins; they concluded that CBCT and MDCT were nearly equivalent [5, 11] . Abdel-Rehim et al [12] evaluated the accuracy of contrast-enhanced CBCT in assessing the ablation zone compared to 1-2 months post-procedural contrastenhanced MDCT, reporting an excellent correlation between ablation zone volumes with both techniques. The utility of combining intravenous contrast-enhanced CBCT with ultrasound guidance to plan, implement, and iteratively modify and optimize probe positioning during hepatic tumor ablation was also evaluated by our group. The high rate of needle repositioning when US was used as primary guidance modality warrants further exploration in larger randomized studies and comparisons with other techniques, including arterial injection contrast-enhanced CBCT, postprocedural contrast-enhanced CBCT, US-CT image fusion, and conventional CT-guided tumor ablation. The radiation exposure associated with CBCT has been evaluated in several studies [8, 14] . Although CBCT has been shown to increase abdominal dose levels, as compared with DSA or MDCT, it also changes the way the procedure is performed, which may compensate for this slight increase. A case-by-case evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio should be performed in all patients.",

Colonoscopy offers a high diagnostic yield combined with therapeutic options. Angiographic embolisation should be performed in patients with severe ongoing bleeding and haemodynamic instability if there is no time for rapid colon preparation and colonoscopy. The American Collage of Gastroenterology has recommended an initial upper endoscopy in these patients to exclude UGIB before angiography or CT angiography. Performing CT angiography before the angiographic procedure is recommended. CT may identify less likely origins of haematochezia in the upper GI tract of the small intestine. Angiographic embolisation can also be considered in patients with recurrent bleeding after colonoscopy. A three-phase CT examination comprising unenhanced, arterial and portal venous phases of the entire abdomen is generally considered best for evaluating acute LGIB. The scan should be performed without oral contrast. Positive oral contrast may obscure bleeding, and water may dilute contrast extravasation. CT angiography has excellent sensitivity and can detect bleeding that exceeds the rate of 0.3-0.5 ml/min. Active bleeding appears on the CT scan as an intraluminal contrast blush in the arterial phase and with changing appearance of the hyperattenuating area in the portal venous phase. Hyperattenuating blood clots on the unenhanced CT are a sign of recent bleeding. Combining the three phases of CT and paying attention to the changing appearance of contrast extravasation between arterial and portal venous phases is essential for interpreting CT results. Multiplanar post-processing and maximum intensity projection can help to determine vascular anatomy and are very useful for planning a radiological intervention and for reducing interventional procedure time.",

Using virtual unenhanced images can reduce radiation dose, and iodine mapping can potentially increase the sensitivity. The detectable rate of active bleeding is slightly higher for catheter angiography (0.5 ml/min) than for CT angiography. Therefore, in patients with a negative CT scan, catheter angiography will most likely not reveal the source of bleeding. In case of an negative CT scan in a patient that presented with overt LGIB and hemodynamic instability, the bleeding has most likely stopped, but one should be alert for intermittent bleeding. Technetium-99m-labelled red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy can detect a low bleeding rate of 0.1 ml/min, and repeating scans after one initial injection is possible. Therefore, this technique is more suitable for intermittent and obscure bleeding. In general, it is not easily available in emergency situations and is less accurate in identifying the bleeding source compared with CT. Compared with RBC",

One of its main chronic symptoms is rectal bleeding. Its recurrence can alter the quality of life and can, more rarely, cause anemia. Pain is less common, occurring only in the event of a complication (congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, and fissures). The most common treatment involves hygiene and dietary measures, phlebotonics, and/or nonsurgical outpatient treatment (infrared photocoagulation and elastic band ligation). The hemorrhoidal arteriovenous network is a normal vascular formation. There is a clear distinction between the external hemorrhoidal network below the dentate line (under the skin of the anal margin dependent on the pudendal artery, which is a branch of the inferior rectal artery) and the internal hemorrhoidal network located in the upper part of the anal canal above the dentate line (in the submucosal space depending on the superior rectal artery). Internal hemorrhoids are now considered to result from an increase in arterial blood flow from the superior rectal artery into the hemorrhoidal cushion (corpus cavernosum recti) (1) . The replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue causes an expansion of the vascular network of the anorectal submucosa, initiating a negative vicious circle of progressive vascular dilation and venous insufficiency leading to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia. This hyperplasia causes an increase in blood pressure, arterial inflow, and anal pressure in the corpus cavernosum recti. The lower part of the rectum and the anal canal are known to be supplied with blood by the inferior and middle rectal arteries, both of which have origins (pudendal artery and iliac network, respectively) at some distance from the inferior mesenteric artery (2) . By contrast, the mechanical function of the corpus cavernosum recti is dependent on the influx of arterial blood from the branches (superior rectal arteries) of the inferior mesenteric artery. Ten years ago, proctologists developed a new type of treatment: elective transanal Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DG-HAL). DG-HAL technique involves the identification and ligation of the superior rectal arteries under transanal Doppler guidance. The ligation of the superior rectal arteries provides a significant reduction in the arterial blood flow to the hemorrhoid and is effective in treating hemorrhoidal disease (3) . It was feasible that this technique could be compatible with embolization. Thus, we have previously reported that arterial ligation can be performed with coils in the terminal branches of the superior rectal arteries via the endovascular route (4) . The advantages of Emborrhoid and DG-HAL techniques over surgery are that it maintains the hemorrhoidal tissue in place, preserves anal continence without rectal wounds (no local care), causes significantly less pain, and avoids the complications of open surgery, thus allowing a faster return to activity. \"Emborrhoid\" embolization is performed using the right femoral route. The inferior mesenteric artery is catheterized using a Simmons catheter. The superior rectal arteries are then catheterized using a microcatheter. Coils used for the embolization are 0.018-inch long, with 2-3 mm in diameter. Technical success of the Emborrhoid technique has been reported in up to 90% of patients. Clinical success of the Emborrhoid technique has been reported in 74%-83% of patients with no complications (2, 5) . The main advantages of the Emborrhoid technique are as follows: Patients feel absolutely no pain. No major complication, especially no ischemic or continence complication, is related to the Emborrhoid technique. This technique is available for outpatients. Patient can return to activity the day after embolization. Embolization allows a complementary treatment if essential. The technique can be easily performed within an hour. Endovascular treatment offers many benefits, including the complete visualization of all branches of superior rectal arteries and anastomoses with middle and inferior rectal arteries (6) . Using the DG-HAL technique, all arteries may not be detected, which can lead to incomplete treatment especially if anastomoses are present. Embolization eliminates the risk of direct anorectal trauma. The results of our previous study (7) have confirmed the favorable clinical results of previous studies and have also objectively demonstrated that at 1 month after embolization, hemorrhoidal bundles significantly decrease in size; that embolization particles do not cause ischemia in histology; and that the sphincter exhibits a normal physiology 1 month after embolization. We hypothesized that embolization is more effective with particles because they cause a more distal hemorrhoidal plexus embolization, thereby restricting the superior rectal arteries reloads by the middle rectal arteries. A randomized controlled study is warranted for confirming the benefits of this technique. Many patients suffer from hemorrhoids but do not complain to physicians because they do not wish to have an endorectal treatment. We believe that if a pain-free treatment for this condition is offered to outpatients, more patients will seek treatment.",

It has also been shown that GV bleed at a lower pressure than EV. Thus, for patients with GV and a gastrorenal shunt, it is recommended to embolize the entire varix with a sclerosant rather than simply embolizing the inflow vein. This can be done through an antegrade approach using TIPS or by performing a simultaneous or subsequent BRTO. BRTO is recommended to obliterate GV in patients with isolated GV (i.e., no EV, ascites, or hydrothorax) or encephalopathy. The rebleeding rate is equivalent between both procedures, with less incidences of encephalopathy when performing a BRTO procedure. It is worth noting that patients will have sequelae of worsening portal hypertension after BRTO. Thus, close surveillance of EV with endoscopy is recommended. In addition, approximately 7%-10% of patients will have significant ascites or hydrothorax requiring TIPS placement after BRTO.",

Differences in recommendations among guidelines mirror the differences in cancer epidemiology, techniques availability and expertise in various countries. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification has emerged during recent years as the standard classification that is used for the clinical management of patients with HCC (6, 7) . This classification links stage stratification with a recommended treatment strategy and defines the standard of care at each tumour stage. It has been endorsed by an EASL panel of experts and the AASLD guidelines (1, 2) . According to the BCLC staging system, refined in 2016, imageguided tumour ablation is recommended in patients with very earlyand early-stage HCC (7) . Despite the widespread implementation of surveillance programmes, more than half of the patients with HCC are diagnosed late, when curative treatments cannot be applied. In addition, in a high proportion of patients, the disease recurs after a curative therapy. For patients presenting with multinodular HCC and relatively preserved liver function, the absence of cancer-related symptoms, and no evidence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, i.e. patients classified as having intermediate-stage HCC according to the BCLC staging system, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the current standard of care. Although antitumour activity and promising survival results have been reported in cohorts of patients with advanced HCC treated with radioembolisation, systemic treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is still recommended for such patients (1, 2, 7) . Patients with solitary intermediate-sized HCC (3-5 cm) , even if not specifically categorised by current guidelines, can be considered as a specific subset of patients early-stage HCC. The tumour size make ablation alone unlikely to be a radical treatment with current techniques, but theoretically, TACE does not represent a treatment option at this stage. When clinically significant portal hypertension and abnormal bilirubin levels contraindicate surgical treatment, a combination of TACE followed by RFA has been used to minimise heat loss due to perfusion-mediated tissue cooling and increase the therapeutic effect of RF ablation (8) . The results of a recent meta-analysis have shown that RFA plus TACE significantly improve the overall 1-and 3-year survival rates compared with those by RFA alone in patients with a single HCC of >3 cm (9) . TACE with drug-eluting beads has also been performed after an RF ablation procedure to increase tumour necrosis by exposing the peripheral part of the tumour to high drug concentration, whereas only sublethal temperatures may be achieved in a standard RF ablation treatment (10) . Further research to determine optimal methods of combining chemotherapeutic regimens (both agent, route of administration, time interval between TACE and RFA or vice versa) with RF ablation is needed. It has been suggested that a single-step 'combined' approach, with both procedures performed in the same session, enables the achievement and amplification of the synergistic effects of RFA and TACE (11) . Moreover, initial reports have suggested that with the use of current MWA devices, percutaneous ablation of HCCs of up to 5 cm can be achieved with high efficacy (12, 13) . Researchers and companies are also exploring new strategies for increasing the results of ablation. A phase III, randomised, doubleblinded, placebo-controlled study (HEAT trial) investigating the efficacy and safety of lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin in combination with RFA compared with those of RFA alone in the treatment of non-resectable HCC has recently been completed (14) . When heated to \u226540\u00b0C during an RFA procedure, lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin produces high drug concentration in the surrounding margins of the ablation zone. RFA plus lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin did not improve the efficacy of normal practice RFA. However, among the 285 patients with a solitary lesion who received at least 45-min RFA dwell time, the hazard ratio in Australia and most South American and Asian countries) for both glass and resin microspheres include all unresectable hepatic neoplasms, both primary and metastatic. Despite these approvals and increasing utilization, radioembolization is only mentioned as an option within the NCCN guidelines (competing with chemoembolization, bland embolization, hepatic arterial infusion, ablation, sorafenib, systemic chemotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, clinical trials, and best supportive care) and is not included in the BCLC and HKLC algorithms. The optimal application of this effective but expensive technology has yet to be defined. Specifically, no head-to-head study has shown superiority over chemoembolization or bland embolization. In addition, the cost effectiveness of any salvage treatment, whether transarterial or systemic, in patients with advanced HCC with limited life expectancy has been put into question. Nevertheless, many experienced centers are now favoring radioembolization for the treatment of more advanced disease (TNM stage III and IV, BCLC-C, and HKLC stage 3b and 4a) because of a perception of greater initial tumoricidal effect, less need for repeated treatment, and less severe toxicity including fewer ischemia-related adverse events, such as fever, emesis, abscesses, and infarctions. Radioembolization has been shown to be effective as a bridge to transplantation and as a downstaging strategy for patients initially presenting with excessive disease burden precluding transplantation. According to the BCLC and HKLC algorithms, only patients with BCLC-B and HKLC-3a and 3b disease are eligible for transarterial therapy, namely chemoembolization. In practice, though, many patients with later stage disease also receive radioembolization and appear to benefit from it. However, to justify the modification of treatment algorithms, in the current era of evidence-based medicine, escalating costs, and tighter financial management of medical resources, more and higher quality data will be necessary to establish the optimal utilization of radioembolization. Comparison trials pitting radioembolization against other options may be difficult to complete or quickly become obsolete because technological developments in chemoembolization and bland embolization materials and improvements in imaging guidance, systemic targeted therapies, and immunotherapies are also raising the standards of the comparators. Populationbased studies using \"big data\" tools, such as deep learning and artificial intelligence, may provide some answers when randomized controlled trials are not feasible or affordable. Unfortunately, the continued increase in the incidence of HCC will require better solutions than what we offer now. not indicated. The interventional radiologist may encounter different clinical situations and should be able to choose the most appropriate treatment considering not only the location of the lesion but also the symptoms and general status of the patient. He should also be aware of the existing surgical possibilities because interventional radiology is not appropriate for all situations. We will review the indications and evidence in the literature for each location. Compressive stress: spine Vertebroplasty is indicated to consolidate malignant compression fractures of the vertebral body in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Vertebroplasty reduces the pain related to pathological fractures and provides bone stabilisation, thus avoiding further vertebral collapse. Reports on the use of cementoplasty to consolidate pathological fractures of the vertebral body, with a high level of evidence, have been published for more than 25 years. Several reports have highlighted the safety and efficacy of other vertebral augmentation techniques (such as kyphoplasty, vertebral body stenting and kiva implantation), but the benefit of these devices over conventional vertebroplasty in the management of malignant fractures is unclear. The decision of prophylactic consolidation of asymptomatic lytic lesions should be based on imaging features. The risk of vertebral body collapse increases with increase in the percentage of bone destruction and becomes significant if the tumour infiltrates more than 50%-60% of the vertebral body in the thoracic spine and more than 35%-40% of the vertebral body in the lumbar spine. These rates decrease if there is an associated destruction of the posterior elements of the vertebra. The scores of spinal instability exist and may be used to decide whether vertebroplasty or surgery is the most appropriate. When cementoplasty is not enough: long bones of the limbs In the literature, Mirel's score has been widely reported to evaluate the risk of fracture of bone metastases in the limbs. In case of fracture or a score of >8, surgical fixation should be considered. Intramedullary nailing appears to be the most effective technique and offers an immediate consolidation with a minimally invasive approach. Alternatives to surgery, such as cement-filled catheters of flexible nails, have been proposed, but there are only few evidences in the literature. Cementoplasty alone has also been reported and appears effective in elevating the pain and improving the mechanical function of the limb, especially for lesions measuring <3 cm and located in the upper limb, but is associated with the risk of secondary fractures (up to 10% in the literature). However, fracture in a cemented long bone does not preclude secondary surgery. Fractures or impending fractures of the proximal extremity of the femur requires surgery whenever possible. In non-surgical patients presenting with an impending fracture, the combination of cementoplasty and screw fixation of the femoral neck may be proposed. Complexity of the pelvis The pelvis is a very frequent location of bone metastases. Cementoplasty has been widely used to treat lytic lesions of the acetabular roof with favourable results. Care should be taken in case of cortical disruption because intra-articular cement leakage may have disastrous functional consequences, often leading to surgical hip replacement. The fixation of pathological fractures of the iliac wing with open surgery is effective and is usually performed in patients with a long life expectancy. In many cases, end-stage patients cannot benefit from a surgical treatment because it is associated with a high morbidity. Cementoplasty may be used, but mechanical properties of the cement do not adapt to stress forces applied to the iliac wing. Therefore, the secondary fracture of a cemented zone is likely to occur. Recently, percutaneous screw fixation has been proposed to treat these fractures. Several studies have already reported the feasibility and safety of CT-guided screw fixation in the pelvis of trauma patients. Associated cementoplasty may help to fix the screws in the bone to avoid secondary dislodgement. lower in the DES group until 2 years post-treatment with a trend toward significance (P=0.066). Less minor amputations occurred after DES until 6 months post-treatment (P=0.03). Long-term follow-up of the PADI trial consisted of annual assessments up to 5 years post-treatment or until a clinical endpoint was reached. Preserved primary patency (\u226450% restenosis) of treated lesions was an additional morphological endpoint assessed by duplex sonography. The estimated 5-year major amputation rate was lower in the DES arm (DES 19.3% vs. PTA\u00b1BMS 34%; P=0.091). The 5-year amputation-free survival and event-free survival (survival free from major amputation and re-intervention) rates were significantly higher in the DES arm (DES 31.8%, PTA\u00b1BMS 20.4%; P=0.043 and DES 26.2%, PTA\u00b1BMS 15.3%; P=0.041, respectively) . The limited available morphologic results showed higher preserved patency rates after DES than those after PTA\u00b1BMS at 1, 3, and 4-year follow-ups. Data from the PADI trial were combined with those from the rejuvenating endothelial progenitor cells via transcutaneous intra-arterial supplementation (JUVENTAS) trial in order to determine implications of diabetes in a population of patients with CLI and infrapopliteal lesions and to study the prognostic value of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Diabetes was present in 49.1% of patients in the combined population. The major amputation rate at 5 years of follow-up was higher in patients with diabetes than that in patients without diabetes (34.1% vs. 20.4%, P=0.015). The major event and death rates did not differ. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of diabetes for the major amputation risk was 1.87 (95% CI 1. 12-3.12) . Model factors with significant HRs in the multivariate analysis were baseline Rutherford category (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1. 24-3.06 ) and ABI > 1. 4 (HR 2.78; ).",

            "text": "In accordance with general safety practices, all attending personnel should be adequately trained in basic life support. At least one attending personnel should be trained in advanced life support, and a resuscitation team should be available readily at all times. Equipment and monitoring of vital data A patient under MDS needs to be supervised continually by a trained practitioner who has no responsibility other than clinical observation of the patient and instrumental monitoring of his/her vital signs. Continuous instrumental monitoring comprises monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, pulse rate, three-lead electrocardiogram (five-lead electrocardiogram in patients with a relevant cardiac history) and intermittent non-invasive blood pressure. Although the evidence is scarce and occasionally contradicting, continuous capnometry is valued as the first-choice early-warning method for failing pulmonary ventilation, and capnometer has become a standard monitor in many cases. Capnometer has been introduced fairly late as an essential monitor because of its limitation in sampling of end-expiratory gases in patients who breathe spontaneously without an airway device, such as a laryngeal mask or an endotracheal tube. The advent of lightweight disposable devices, which allow not only to administer oxygen but also to retrieve expiratory gases in a semi-quantitative way, has facilitated the use of a capnometer. Whenever respiration is impaired by an upper airway obstruction or by an insufficient respiratory drive because of the combination of opioids and hypnotics/sedatives or both, capnometry provides the earliest warning sign even when oxygen saturation is still normal. When a capnometer is not available or is not used, a decrease in oxygen saturation is a very late sign indicating that ventilation of the lungs is failing. This situation may rapidly proceed to hypoxaemia and associated vital organ damage. Oxygen, a defibrillating AED device, rapid support by an experienced resuscitation team and ready access to a step-up care facility are important prerequisites for patient safety. Registration of data MDS procedures, being risky medical procedures, need to be registered preferably in a digital sedation report, including data from the vital parameters; relevant events of the procedure, such as briefing, time out, start and ending of sedation; administered drugs; sedation scores, such as the (adapted) Ramsay scores or the OAAS scores (3); proceedings and events of the endoscopic procedure and advertent effects. This serves as the legal obligation to enable an exact replication of the entire event, including sedation, in case of an unwanted outcome or for justification to the patient or to independent investigators in cases of reclamation of the patient. Recovery Nowadays, long-acting drugs are no longer recommended for MDS because of unpredictable effects on consciousness and ventilation as well as late complications when the stress of the endoscopic procedures gradually disappears. This does not mean that recovery care is not necessary when using short-acting drugs. Propofol, benzodiazepines, remifentanil, alfentanil, dexmedetomidine, ketamine and others are relatively short-acting but are also very potent. Moreover, they may strongly interact with other agents, which affects the level of consciousness, and potentially with the medication that the patient is taking. When a painful endoscopic procedure ends and the administration of sedative/analgesic drugs is discontinued, the patient may wake up early. However, when the patient is kept on bed or is wheeled to the recovery area, sedation may return in the absence of the painful stimulus and respiration may be impaired, causing significant hypoxaemia. Therefore, it is recommended that patients are again clinically observed by a competent nurse and that the same vital parameters are instrumentally monitored (pulse oxymetry, capnometry, NIBP and ECG). Patients can be discharged from the recovery area based on the standard discharge criteria (5) . Continuous quality improvement programmes require that all data on patient sedation be collected for regular evaluation and quality improvement strategic goals. Regular multidisciplinary meetings to discuss unexpected events during the procedures and during MDS, new developments and the application of quality indicators are very helpful for continuously improving the quality of care.",

More importantly, we observed a strong relative increase in the number of ASA class III and IV patients who opted for MDS services. This development increases strain on anaesthesia departments, which are bearing responsibilities for sedation to cope with these changes. In our department, the total number of patients eligible for MDS increased from 401 in 2010 to 2188 in 2015, a 5.4-fold increase. However, more importantly, the number of ASA III patients increased from 4% to 30% in the same time period. This emphasises the need for vigilance to maintain high-quality standards (6) .

Drugs that do not have active metabolites and do not depend on renal or hepatic elimination are also preferable. The cognitive deterioration should always be considered (3, 4) . The elderly require careful titration of sedative/analgesic drugs. Incremental dosing increases patient comfort and reduces the risk of adverse effects (1, 2, 12) . Sufficient time must elapse between doses to allow the effect of each dose to be assessed before subsequent drug administration. When routes other than intravenous are used (e.g. rectal, intramuscular and transmucosal), drug pharmacokinetics may be altered and unpredictable. Careful consideration of possible drug-to-drug interactions with other coadministered drugs, mostly affecting the central nervous system or the cardiovascular status, should be performed (1, 3, 4) . Literature suggests that combinations of drugs may be used (most commonly combining a sedative with an opioid) but with extreme care in the elderly because of the increased additive pharmacodynamic sedational effect and the increased risk of adverse effects (1) (2) (3) (4) . Advanced age may be associated with increased vulnerability to ventilatory depression, hypoxia and haemodynamic deterioration. Ideally, each component should be administered individually and titrated to the desired effect, leaving the required amount of intervals between subsequent doses to allow each drug to reach its maximum effect. Most of the times, reduced dose of each drug is required when used in combinations because of additive pharmacodynamic effects. Paradoxical drug effect Benzodiazepines and propofol are widely used for sedation. They exhibit similar modes of action, mainly through the activation of the inhibiting GABA pathway. The rare effect of paradoxical agitation after administering these drugs may complicate an interventional procedure and necessitate more specialised management. The main features of paradoxical reactions include emotional deterioration, agitation, excessive movement and confusion, combined with or without exaggerated autonomic nervous system activation, tachycardia, hypertension and tachypnea. These reactions have mostly been described after the administration of benzodiazepines (1%-2%), but they have also been reported after the use of propofol in some cases. The main risk factors include alcoholism, extremes of age and psychiatric comorbidities (1, 13) . The paradoxical reactions should be a diagnosis of exclusion because in critically ill patients, symptoms may overlap with disease-related clinical features, such as hypoxia and hypovolaemia. Aetiology remains unclear but may be related to alterations of the GABAergic pathway and differences in receptor subunit composition. Management comprises discontinuing the offending agent and the addition of a non-GABA sedating medication (i.e. opioids, antipsychotics, dexmedetomidine and ketamine), whereas antagonism of the causal factor by a specific reversal agent (flumazenil in the case of benzodiazepines) has also been suggested (13) .",

Conditions that must alarm physicians of the possibility of difficulties during sedation or of extreme reactions/adverse effects that may require an advice by a specialist or even anaesthesiological assistance as follows (5) (6) (7) (10) (11) (12) : \u2022 History of apnoea or high risk of aponea (documented by sleep study, strong clinical history or apnoea monitor) \u2022 Respiratory-compromised patients (with recent <8 weeks pneumonia, active bronchitis, asthma exaggeration or respiratory infection) \u2022 Uncontrolled/unpredictable gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting that poses aspiration risk; any case of increased aspiration risk (increased intra-abdominal pressure, full stomach, pregnancy, etc.) \u2022 Craniofacial abnormality and history of difficult airway \u2022 Unstable cardiac disease (cyanotic cardiac disease, abnormal cardiac anatomy, depressed myocardial function, significant stenotic or regurgitation lesions or life-threatening arrhythmia) \u2022 Hypotonia or lack of head control (patient may not be able to maintain his/her airway without assistance) \u2022 Allergies to sedative/analgesic drugs \u2022 Anterior mediastinal mass \u2022 Tremors (unlikely to be ablated by sedation) \u2022 Prior failed sedation \u2022 Painful procedure that may be challenging to provide adequate analgesia without a general anaesthetic \u2022 High-risk procedure that may require the presence of an anesthesiologist for resuscitation \u2022 Procedure that requires absolute immobility \u2022 Procedure being performed in remote location where immediate emergency backup assistance would be impossible \u2022 Inadequately qualified personnel available to provide safe procedural sedation Fluid management Intravenous fluid administration should be based on the physiological status of the patient, the degree of hypovolaemia, the cardiovascular and renal reserve, and the nature of the procedure. Interventions that are accompanied by significant blood loss require special care of because of the possibility of coagulation disorders and the necessity of transfusion of blood products. Specialists' consultation should be available in cases in which hypovolaemia or acute haemorrhage is present. Fluid therapy should by 'goaldirected' and appropriately monitored (through standard BP and HR monitoring and urine output) using more sophisticated monitors in complicated cases (invasive BP measurement, CVP measurement, etc.) (1) (2) (3) (4) . There is no consensus regarding the optimal fluid management in the elderly because it should be individualised based on the nature of the procedure and the co-existing diseases. However, more 'restricted' strategies are commonly preferred over fixed-volume administration, aiming to maintain a stable cardiovascular status and a normal urine output (3, 4) .",

The evolution of endovascular therapy has changed the way of treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in a way that no one could have imagined 20 years ago. The promising initial results have been confirmed by more recent studies. Moreover, long-term follow-up supported the use of stentgraft (EVAR) for the treatment of AAAs. What we have also observed is an increase in the inclusion criteria; initially, only those patients who were not good candidates for surgery were considered suitable for EVAR, but with each passing year, endovascular procedure has become the treatment of choice even in more complex situations such as short and angulated necks. Recently, the 15-year follow-up of the EVAR-1 trial reported an aneurysm-related mortality rate greater for patients who underwent EVAR compared with that for those treated with open repair; however, the authors stated that during the entire follow-up, the aneurysm-related mortality was not significantly different between the two groups.

After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, mean life-years were 4.89 in the EVAR and 4.84 in the open repair groups. Similar results were also reported in the DREAM trial: 12-year after initial randomization, the cumulative overall survival rates were 42.2% after open repair and 38.5% after endovascular repair. Unlike the EVAR-1 trial, increased aneurysm-related mortality after EVAR over the long term was not found in the DREAM trial. Both EVAR 1 and DREAM trials showed the highest rate of reintervention to be between 4 and 6 years depending on stentgraft durability. However, we have to consider that these data are correlated with the use of \"first\" generation devices and that the increased mortality rate seems to be correlated with a higher incidence of post-EVAR sac rupture. Therefore, reintervention rates might be higher compared with more recent studies investigating newer generation stentgrafts. This is also confirmed by a recent study comparing long-term outcomes with newer and older stentgrafts that demonstrated similar perioperative and long-term mortalities. ",

The typical follow-up consists of CT angiography or Duplex ultrasound performed at regular intervals. CT-based follow-up, although highly reliable, is hampered by the significant exposure to ionizing radiation and the repetitive administration of iodinated contrast medium that may lead to radiationinduced disease and renal failure. Furthermore, these examinations cause a significant economic burden that may comprise 30%-50% of costs of EVAR follow-up. Finally, with the development of newer generation stentgrafts, a better knowledge on the behavior of stentgrafts, the importance of endoleaks and mechanisms of stentgraft failure, and better sizing and planning (using 3D tools) the number of complications related to EVAR has been reduced significantly. All these factors require and allow for a more tailored approach for EVAR follow-up. This presentation will discuss the rationale behind such individualized programs of follow-up and will provide algorithms that allow a reduction of the number and alter the type of follow-up examinations after EVAR.",

Ritter 1 1 Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Paracelsus Medical University, Nuremberg, Germany, 2 Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Klinikum Nuremberg, Nuremberg, Germany The indication to treat an aneurysm is based on the rupture versus surgical risk. In general, abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) deserve treatment when they reach a diameter of 5.5 cm. 1 Smaller aneurysms, as shown by the CAESAR trial, do not deserve treatment even with endovascular repair because there is no survival benefit overall. 2 For thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), the treatment indication threshold has always been 6 cm, mainly in view of the higher risk of an extensive surgery. In TAAA repair, the impact and risk of surgery is so high that many patients are refused open repair. According to the literature, a high proportion of these TAAAs will rupture and lead to death. 3 The option to treat TAAA by endovascular means has logically opened the way to treat patients who would not be offered open repair. 4 As always, minimally invasive techniques are then \"overused\" before learning to respect the anatomical restrictions and other limitations. With regard to patient risk stratification, little is known because most articles on complex endovascular techniques state that they treated \"high-risk\" patients. We reviewed the results of our TAAA branched cases in terms of the learning curve with regard to technical success, mortality, and outcomes. Growing experience has undoubtedly led to better planning and better execution, with lower technical failure and the possibility to treat more complex anatomies. The main question for this presentation is whether there still are limitations with regard to the patient risk status. The risk balance analyses are based on the age and comorbidity of the patient on one side and extent of aneurysm and anatomical limitations on the other. The literature should be appraised critically because there is never a clear definition of \"high risk.\" Looking back at the 300 TAAA branched cases, in an attempt to divide the patients into an \"old and frail\" patient group versus a normal \"high-risk\" group, mortality was clearly higher in the \"old and frail\" group with 22.7% versus 6.2% in the normal \"high-risk\" group (P<.001) and survival was lower with an overall mortality of 52.9% versus 18.7% (P=.006) at a mean follow-up of 24.2\u00b120 months. It is therefore safe to conclude that indications to treat old and frail patients should be exerted with extra caution, especially in TAAAs with borderline diameters or with a challenging anatomy. Conclusion: \"Primum non nocere\" in old and frail patients. Introduction Chronic kidney disease is becoming a global healthcare problem with worldwide incidence and prevalence. Majority of patients with chronic kidney disease rely on hemodialysis to survive renal failure. Therefore, a viable vascular access, in terms of function and patency, in these patients is vital. Low access flow and loss of patency may impede adequate hemodialysis and even lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Loss of vascular access patency, usually preceded by the development of access stenosis accounts for 15%-20% of hospitalizations among patients on hemodialysis [1] [2] [3] . Therefore, predicting access failure is of great clinical and socioeconomic importance for both patient and society.",

To forecast access dysfunction, several techniques are available. Physical examination Inspection, palpation, and auscultation are the three main components of physical access examination, which can be used to assess vascular access function. The swelling/edema of the extremity, ischemic fingers, aneurysms, and/or collateral veins can be detected by visual inspection and may be related to access-related complications. Although subjective, assessing the strength of the arterial inflow and venous outflow by palpation and/or auscultation is a useful test. In general, a fistula has a continuous thrill and is soft and compressible. However, in presence of a downstream stenosis or occlusion, the fistula becomes very pulsatile (\"water-hammer pulse\") with a weak thrill. Conversely, a weak pulse indicates poor arterial inflow and/or a stenosis at the anastomosis level. In addition, the location of stenosis can be palpated by experienced hands. In grafts, the direction of flow can be easily detected using a simple compression maneuver. A local intensification of bruit over the graft or the venous anastomosis may indicate a stenosis 4 . Although proven to be cost-effective, regular physical examination has not become very popular among nurses and/or doctors in the hemodialysis departments. This is probably due to the high workload in the dialysis departments and also due to the lack of specific training, which plays an important role.",

Using ultrasonic sensors, changes in protein concentration can be measured while infusing saline distally in the vascular access, which allows the calculation of the access blood flow. Although the accuracy of this technique is influenced by many (hemodynamic) parameters that potentially under-or overestimate the flow, it is the most validated and broadly accepted technique 5 . Venous dialysis pressure Although measurements of pressure from the hemodialysis circuit were not originally designed to assess access (dys)function, it is currently one of the surveillance tools. Pressures can be measured through the arterial and venous needles and have to be compared with each other as well as to the mean arterial pressure to assess the location of the possible stenosis. When the intra-access pressure increases to >50% of the mean arterial pressure, graft flow is likely decreased to the thrombosis-prone range and the presence of stenosis is likely. Because of the variability of the hemodynamic parameters, there is little correlation between a single measurement of flow and pressure. Serial measurements of pressure in each patient are more valuable than isolated measurements 6 . Duplex ultrasound Duplex ultrasound allows for direct flow measurement by assessing the blood flow velocity in relation to the cross-sectional area of the access. The accuracy of the measurement strongly depends on a correct Doppler angle and on a proper estimation of the cross sectional area, which makes the technique error-sensitive and operatordependent. Furthermore, duplex ultrasound is not very sensitive in the region of the central veins 7 . However, in experienced hands, it is a valuable tool not only to assess the access flow but also to locate the underlying stenosis, which is particularly helpful in planning the subsequent (percutaneous) intervention. In addition, several studies have suggested that duplex-guided balloon angioplasty of failing or non-maturing AVFs is feasible and safe even when it is performed as an office-based procedure 8 .",

Contrast-enhanced MRA has been shown to be a reliable tool for detecting stenoses and occlusion not only in the upper extremity veins but also in the arteries. However, apart from issues regarding the costs and availability of this technique, all interest in the MRA imaging of dialysis accesses has virtually evaporated due to concerns regarding the use of gadolinium in patients with renal failure 9 .

Multi-slice CTA has been shown to be clinically feasible for evaluating the complete vascular tree 10 . Moreover, the modern dual-source CT systems can provide hemodynamic details over the access. However, concerns regarding radiation exposure and the use of contrast agents hamper the widespread application of CTA for access imaging. The rationale for surveillance is based on the assumption that progressive stenoses are accurately detected before thrombosis and that the patency of the vascular access can be maintained with subsequent open or percutaneous intervention. However, to date, randomized controlled trials have not consistently shown that surveillance programs improve outcomes in grafts, which might be explained by the number of clinical and hemodynamic parameters, variation in definitions, and differences in the risk of thrombosis. Thus, surveillance aimed at a high sensitivity in predicting thrombosis has a high false-positive rate that likely yields many unnecessary intervention procedures. Furthermore, balloon angioplasty by definition induces a mechanical trauma, accompanying neointimal hyperplasia and thereby the risk of stenosis and impaired access survival. Given the poor reproducibility of the measurements, it seems plausible that the surveillance will improve if measurements are taken more frequently. Regular, consecutive measurements would allow the calculation of average values that may neutralize hemodynamic variation. Embarking on this strategy will have consequences for staff resources, will require significant patient time, and will cause inconvenience. Despite the controversial data, surveillance continues to be widely supported as a routine part of access maintenance. The KDOQI guidelines recommend an intervention when graft flow is <600 ml/ min or when the flow has decreased by >25% and falls below 1000 ml/min. Fistula referral is not recommended until the flow is <400-500 ml/min because fistulae may remain patent at a flows lower than graft flows. ",

Although evidence continues to accumulate for stent graft placement over angioplasty, the incremental benefit in patency following stent graft placement as a first-line approach has not been proven a more cost-effective strategy to maintaining access patency.

This is an especially effective strategy when the angioplasty location is within or adjacent to needle cannulation zones. Larger tears and ruptures, which do not respond to balloon tamponade maneuvers can benefit from stent graft placement as it can reduce resultant peri-access hematoma formation and blood loss as well as avoid catheter utilization from hematoma-induced arm swelling. Recurrent venous stenosis Two well-described anatomic locations that appear to benefit from recurrent restenosis following angioplasty are the terminal cephalic arch and the transition between in-situ and transposed basilic vein fistulae. The cephalic arch is a challenging location for stent graft placement as the extension of the device into the axillary-subclavian junction can produce upper-extremity deep-vein thrombosis, intractable arm swelling, or both. Moreover, the altered fluid dynamics and wall shear stress at this site induced by the placement of a stent graft (with a resultant jet of blood against the opposing venous wall in the axillary vein) may accelerate intimal hyperplasia and restenosis; more data is needed for routine use in these settings. Introduction The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is well accepted as the primary access option to facilitate dialysis treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. AVFs have better overall long-term durability than the current next best option, i.e., arteriovenous grafts [1] . However, AVFs still exhibit high rates of primary failure (15%-46%), early thrombosis (10%-23%), and interventions (1-2 per patient-year) despite the many procedural advances in surgical creation over the years in Europe [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The result is high patient costs (~\u20ac80 000 per patientyear) and dissatisfaction that leads to the refusal of treatment in favor of central venous catheters [8] . The percutaneous creation of an AVF may provide some benefits that can address the challenges faced by surgery. The Achilles heel of the surgical AVF appears to be early juxta-anastomotic stenosis that likely results from the trauma of surgically dissecting, mobilizing, and suturing of the vein to the artery [9] [10] [11] . Additional challenges arise from the surgical inconsistency in technique from center to center and surgeon to surgeon that results in a wide range of reported outcomes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Lastly, avoiding open surgery helps to minimize the risk of infection and morbidity in patients due to the AVF. Recent advances in catheter-based technology provide an opportunity for interventional radiologists to create an AVF in a minimally invasive, consistent procedure. The endovascular procedure may reduce the incidence of primary failure, early thrombosis, and reinterventions by avoiding the need to dissect, mobilize, and suture the vein. The consistency and reproducibility of a catheter-based approach may also serve to normalize outcomes across vascular centers.",

The outcomes will demonstrate that percutaneous AVF creation has a high technical success rate with low rates of early thrombosis and requirement of few interventions to achieve a high rate of maturation and usability. These outcomes were consistent across the prospective clinical studies and real-world experience. The endovascular AVF procedure The first endovascular AVF (endoAVF) creation called the everlinQ\u2122 endoAVF System for hemodialysis device was introduced in Europe in 2015 by TVA Medical, Inc. The system comprises a venous and an arterial catheter that align at the target AVF creation site via magnets. The endoAVF is created between the artery and adjacent vein (venae comitantes) in the ulnar artery/ulnar vein or the radial artery/ radial vein distal to the perforating vein in the upper forearm. Access is gained in the brachial artery (antegrade) and brachial vein (retrograde) of the upper arm. Once the catheters are in place, an electrode housed in the venous catheter delivers radiofrequency energy for less than 2 s to create a channel between the artery and the vein. The close proximity of the artery and venae comitantes (<2 mm from the inner lumen to the inner lumen) and the dense surrounding tissue of the pedicle facilitates the shunting of blood from the artery to the vein without extravasation. The cephalic and basilic veins receive immediate arterialized flow from the endoAVF via the perforating vein. One of the two brachial vein comitantes is intraprocedurally embolized in a location proximal to the endoAVF to divert more flow to the superficial system. Maturation typically occurs within 60 days post creation. The endo-AVF forms an endothelium along the channel within 30 days post procedure creating a native vessel lacking intraluminal scarring or stenosis. The cephalic and basilic/medial cubital vein segments are available for cannulation starting in the forearm, which is unique to this type of AVF. The cephalic vein is the primary choice for cannulation, but adequate length of the basilic/medial cubital vein segment is available for cannulation without elevation as well.",

            "text": "Outcomes using the everlinQ system in patients with end-stage renal disease who required dialysis have been reported in two prospective clinical studies: FLEX and NEAT. Each study followed similar exclusion/inclusion criteria: target vein and artery diameters of \u22652.0 mm, life expectancy of >1 year, absence of central or ipsilateral upper extremity venous stenosis, or ineligibility for a distal forearm fistula. Key outcomes included technical success (creation of a patent connection between the artery and the concomitant vein, with brisk flow demonstrated by angiography and absence of appreciable extravasation), maturation (brachial artery flow > 500 ml/ min and vein diameter > 4mm), initiation of dialysis via two-needle cannulation, and early thrombosis (thrombotic occlusion within 3 months of creation). In additional, intervention rates and subsequent cost analysis in NEAT were compared with those of a propensity-score matched surgical AVF cohort from the Medicare database. FLEX was a prospective first-in-man study to assess the feasibility of percutaneous AVF creation, and it evaluated the utility of the endo-AVF to provide dialysis access [14] . The study enrolled 33 patients from August 2012 to September 2013 and reported outcomes during a 6-month follow-up period. Technical success was achieved in 97% (32/33) of patients. One patient was lost to follow-up, and four patients died during the follow-up period from causes unrelated to the procedure. Maturation was achieved in 96% (27/28) of the remaining patients with 96% (25/26) initiated dialysis via their endoAVF by 6 months. Two additional patients had usable access but remained pre-dialysis patients. The mean time to pAVF maturation was 58 days (range, 37-168 days). One serious procedurerelated adverse event (pseudoaneurysm that resolved with thrombin injection) and five minor procedure-related adverse events were reported. No access related infections were observed. NEAT was a prospective, multi-center study across Canada, Australia, and New Zealand that was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the endoAVF [15] . The study enrolled 60 patients in the evaluable cohort plus an additional 20 roll-in patients. EndoAVF was created in 98% (59/60) of patients, with 91% (52/57) achieving physiological maturation and only 1.8% (1/57) experiencing early thrombosis. Five patients (8.3%, 5/60) experienced serious procedure-related adverse events, with only one categorized as having device-related adverse event (1.7%, 1/60) . No access related infection was observed. Compared with a propensity-score matched surgical AVF control group from the Medicare database, the endoAVF required fewer post-creation procedures (0.59 vs. 3.43 per patient-year, p < 0.0001), with fewer event rates for angioplasties, thrombectomies, catheter placements, AVG creations, new surgical AVF creations, and vascular access-related infections. The reduction in interventions has a reported cost savings of ~$11,240 USD for the first year for each patient with AVF [16] . In additional, the real-world experience in Germany at the Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus Dresden was reported previously at CIRSE 2016 by Radosa et al on the first eight patients [17] . Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients with no serious peri-interventional complications. Cannulation was initiated in 100% (7/7) of patients, of whom one patient was lost to follow-up and another required an elevation procedure. The median time to endoAVF maturation was 63 days (range: 26 -137 d) with the elevation patient being cannulated at day 137 post creation. No interventions to restore patency, incidence of early thrombosis, or access infections occurred during this data release.",

            "text": "The observed clinical outcomes were comparable with those expected from surgical AVF creation, except potentially lower rates of interventions and thrombosis. A critical metric of successful AVF creation is the initiation of sustained two-needle cannulation for the delivery of adequate dialysis. Once two-needle cannulation begins, the patient's central venous catheter, if they have one, can be removed, which is a primary goal of providing high-quality dialysis care. The experience so far demonstrated that two-needle cannulation was initiated in 67%-96% of patients, which is similar to 54%-85% of surgical patients reported in European patient cohorts [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, the delivery of dialysis via the endoAVF was achieved with less than one intervention per patient-year, whereas surgical AVFs have been reported to require one to two interventions per patientyear in European cohorts [5] [6] [7] . In addition, the early thrombosis as a failure mode tended to be low in the endoAVF clinical studies, and no early thrombosis occurred in the Dresden patient cohort. In contrast, early thrombosis of surgical AVF has been reported in 10%-23% of patients in European cohorts [5] [6] [7] . As with any new technique, a learning curve with the endoAVF procedure was observed and attributed to endoAVF intervention or abandonment in a few patients. These procedural complications are expected to be alleviated with training and experience. In conclusion, the endoAVF appears to be a safe and effective option to provide patients with a functioning AVF. EndoAVF creation has demonstrated high technical success rate with low rates of early thrombosis and requirement of few interventions to achieve a high rate of maturation and usability across multiple clinical settings. The clinical study results have been consistent across multiple studies. The results from the real-world experience in Germany have been similar to the results reported in the prospective clinical studies.

To learn how to use radiation therapy in painful bone metastases 2. To learn how to combine radiation therapy to IR techniques 3. To learn how to evaluate current results reported in the literature Bone metastases have been observed in a high percentage of patients with cancer, showing a variety of symptoms and affecting the quality of life and survival of patients. A multidisciplinary approach from different healthcare providers, including radiation oncologists, international radiologists, medical oncologists, and surgeons, is required for treatment. The role of radiotherapy in the management of bone metastases has long been established through multiple randomized trials. Several equivalent schedules of radiotherapy have been reported, such as 5\u00d7400cGy, 10\u00d7300cGy, and 1\u00d7850cGy. The estimation of response to the therapy is subjective and is based on the palliation of the symptoms in terms of quality of life and pain scores. Objective measurements have also been analyzed mainly in terms of the bone density. The combination of IR and radiotherapy is currently a promising tool for the management of bone metastases, increasing the therapeutic effect of both methods in terms of pain relief and improvement in the bone density in affected areas (mainly lytic). The sequel of either irradiation or IR is currently under investigation with prospective trials. References 1. Kelekis ",

To learn how to use ablation in painful bone metastases for palliative purposes 3. To learn how to evaluate current results reported in the literature In the modern era of interventional radiology focused on oncological patients, the ablation techniques are not any more limited to the usual targets such as HCCs and primary lung tumors and are finding new targets, particularly in MSK tumors of both benign and malignant nature. In the literature, the most encountered benign tumors treated via ablation are osteoid osteoma, although the application of ablation in osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, and osteochondroma has been reported to show good results. In turn, malignancies of the bones are rare, with spinal metastases (originating from carcinomas of the breast, lung, prostate, kidney, and uterus) likely being the most common one. It should be emphasized that in most cases, palliative measures are related to malignant cancer and the patient's quality of life and mortality are the priority. Recently, the indication of tumor control with the intent of increase in the overall life expectancy has been emphasized, particularly in patients with an oligometastatic disease, a good performance status, and a life expectancy of more than 6 months. The treatment of spinal lesions could be challenging considering the risk of severe neurologic dysfunction with dramatic consequences pertaining to the quality of life. For these reasons, some precautions must be taken in order to prevent such risks. For the same reason, among the ablation techniques, cryotherapy is gaining interest of the IR community due to its powerful pain management feature and the possibility of an instant check of the ice ball, preserving nervous tissues, particularly in case of vertebral metastases. Nevertheless, ablation may be applied both for curative and palliative strategies when combined with cement injection, allowing a precise patient selection. New heroes of oncologic interventions and probably future trend are MR-guided HIFU (also known as FUS) and irreversible electroporation despite requiring a higher cost. Improved research in the field is strongly needed to assess a proper cost-effective analysis and the limits of these approaches. Introduction Osseous metastases may result in intractable pain, instability/fracture and neurologic compromise. Embolisation alone or in combination with other techniques should be a part of the treatment algorithm [1] [2] [3] . The goal is tumour devascularisation without non-target compromise, resulting in reduced tumour turgor and periosteal pain fibre stimulation. Additional potential benefits include reduced recurrence rate and prolonged survival; chemoembolisation is under active investigation. Indications Pre-operative embolisation limits intra-operative blood loss [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , ensuring optimal visualisation and adequate resection 4 and reducing operative duration and mortality. Without embolisation, resections are occasionally abandoned due to uncontrolled haemorrhage 17, 18 . Embolisation has an important role in the palliative setting, frequently in combination with other modalities 2, 3 .",

Nair S, Gobin YP, Leng LZ, Marcus To learn about the several PTC retrieval techniques 3. To learn how to make the procedural management and to avoid complications Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is an established lifesaving drainage procedure for the management of high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis might be the result of calculous disease. After PC, transcatheter cholangiography is performed to assess the patency of cystic duct, presence of gallstones and catheter position. After the end of inflammation, if patients are still considered as inoperable, percutaneous treatment with gallbladder stone retrieval can be attempted. In the last 20 years, interventional radiologic techniques for the treatment of gallstone disease have become more widely available. In the past, percutaneous chemical ablation of the gallbladder was a relative popular method offering a potential solution to the problem of gallstone recurrence. So, in the late 90s, contact dissolution of stones with methyl tert-butyl-ether and percutaneous extraction of calculi was treatment options in such patients. In patients with cholesterol-rich gallbladder stones and a patent cystic duct, complete stone clearance rates of 65-90% have been reported using oral bile acids (OBAs) alone or with adjuvant lithotripsy (extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy; ESWL). With increasing use of intra-corporeal gallstone lithotripsy techniques, combined fluoroscopic with or without direct cholangioscopic visualization during percutaneous procedures become more important. Limitations or relative contraindications to percutaneous cholecysto-lithotomy (PCCL) were a small, shrunken, thick-walled gallbladder or an intrahepatic gallbladder. First, tract dilation had to be performed until a quite wide and mature channel was formed. After that, peel-away sheaths was introduced through which further interventions were operated. A safety guide wire had to be placed outside the sheath in order to get new access in case something went wrong. Endoscopes, stone-baskets, extraction balloons and other instruments were inserted through the sheath for a less traumatic procedure. Complete stone clearance can be achieved using multiple sessions over several months. Gallstones complete clearance of over 80% is reported in the literature. Complete symptom relief can be obtained in more than 95 percent of these patients. Patients with Mirizzi syndrome involving a common bile duct stone are rare cases. Trans-cholecystic treatment using lithotripsy via a cholangio-fiberscope can be performed in such patients. Complications associated with PC usually occur immediately or within days and including haemorrhage, vagal reactions, sepsis, bile peritonitis, pneumothorax, perforation of the intestinal loop, secondary infection or colonization of the gallbladder and catheter dislodgment. Regarding stone extraction, biliary fistulas and major bile leakages may be encountered. In experienced hands, PCCL can be a safe, effective procedure for clearing the gallbladder of calculi regardless of their size, composition, or number. It preserves the gallbladder, enables possible restoration of contractility, and can be performed without general anesthesia. The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate the techniques and to discuss the indications, complications, and technical difficulties of this alternative percutaneous treatment option.

Gastroenterol Clin North Am.;20 (1) At present, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) associated with endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) represents the first-line approach for the removal of bile duct stones. However, some stones may be refractory or not suitable for endoscopic removal, thereby requiring additional or other therapeutic options. Those stones are called 'difficult bile duct stones' and may be associated with one or more of the following features: periampullary diverticula, previous surgery, large stones (\u226520 mm), presence of multiple stones, stones above a stricture, intrahepatic stones, impacted stones and patient's clinical conditions that actually represent main indications for percutaneous cholangioscopy (PTCS) and lithotripsy. Surgery was mainly indicated in relatively young patients with good clinical condition/fair liver function with unilobar hepatolithiasis, particularly left-sided, atrophy, fibrosis and multiple abscesses secondary to cholangitis and/or suspicion of concomitant operable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.",

The correct choice can be made according to the Tsunoda classification (from class I to IV) and stone size (i.e. greater or smaller than 25 mm). To classify and select patients appropriately, magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography (MRCP) or post-contrast CT should be performed beforehand. In case of stones less than 20 mm and mainly located in the common bile duct (CBD) at imaging, the endoscopic approach (ERCP) should be attempted first. If this fails or in the presence of larger stones (>20 mm), intrahepatic or impacted stones or stones associated with narrowed CBD, a percutaneous approach should be considered as the preferred method. If a percutaneous approach is decided, a US-guided puncture or double puncture technique should be chosen according to the Tsunoda class, location of the target stones and bile duct anatomy (any anatomic variant should be promptly recognised as it may impact the technical success). IR techniques, such as PTC which are associated with the use of large PTA balloons (used to dilate strictures) and basket-type catheters, were mainly indicated in Tsunoda class I patients with a few stones less than 25 mm in diameter. In more complex cases, the use of a cholangioscope (CS) was recommended under general anaesthesia. Large-bore or small calibre CS with electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) or laser probes may be used according to the extent of the disease and patient's characteristics. Recent studies reported the use of small calibre CS with EHL or YAG laser (approximately 3 mm in calibre) obtaining complete stone clearance in more than 80% cases. Also, large-bore endoscopes have been used (16 or 18 Fr calibre) with a low complication rate. Generally, large CS should be used mainly in complex Tsunoda class III and IV patients. In our and other recent studies, the technical success (complete stone clearance) was above 83% with combined techniques. If only IR techniques were used, intrahepatic stone clearance may drop down to 61% as reported by Ozcan et al. In our series, most complex patients needed at least three sessions for complete stone clearance. The recurrence rate may vary according to the complexity and type of techniques used, ranging between 15% and 56% of patients treated. Usually, recurrent cases are successfully treated with similar techniques.",

Lethal radiation doses for adenocarcinomas are high (up to 60 Gy), and increasing doses heighten the risk of damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Perihilar location of tumors is risky because of radiation sensitivity of the liver, whereas distal tumors affecting the bile ducts can only be irradiated while considering the vicinity of the duodenum and the small intestine with caution. Intraluminal brachytherapy of the bile ducts is a minimally invasive method that can overcome disadvantages of high-dose externalbeam radiation therapy. It has the possibility of administering higher radiation doses in a shorter time than with external radiation. In brachytherapy, percutaneous access is used to reach the bile ducts or it can be endoscopically applied through an implanted drainage catheter. Fletcher et al. were among the first to use intraluminal brachytherapy with iridium as a radiation source (iridium-192) in the late 1970s. When using intraluminal radiation therapy with an iridium radiation source, iridium is shaped into cylindrical, granular, or filiform particles that emit gamma and beta radiation within the affected area. Afterloading systems are currently used for administering brachytherapy. These automatically place the radiation source into an applicator positioned in a pre-established location. High-dose rate (HDR) techniques with an application of >12 Gy/hour or low-dose rate (LDR) techniques with an application of <2 Gy/hour are used. Advantages of HDR brachytherapy are shorter hospitalization time and according to the literature, lower rates of cholangitis due to drain occlusion. Brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy techniques can be safely combined; the objectives being not only to limit the effect of radiation therapy to the bile ducts but also to irradiate lymphatic drainage. There are local differences depending on the radiation dose applied in brachytherapy. When combining external radiation therapy and brachytherapy, the usual dose is in the range of 7-30 Gy, prescribed at a distance of 0.5-1.0 cm from the center of the source in 1-6 fractions. Each fraction typically consists of 5.0-7.5 Gy and takes several minutes in one HDR brachytherapy session. In the case of standalone brachytherapy, 20-42 Gy is applied.",

            "text": "During the administration of brachytherapy, cholangitis and liver abscess may develop because of cholestasis. It is necessary to anticipate acute and late radiation toxicity, particularly when HDR brachytherapy is combined with external radiotherapy. Thirty-day patient mortality is reported on rare occasions, and biliary and gastrointestinal bleeding have been occasionally reported in other studies. Symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity appear in up to 30% of patients, most frequently as very moderate vomiting and nausea, while gastrointestinal ulceration and erosion may occur in later stages. It is frequently recommended to concurrently administer chemotherapy with radiation therapy when treating tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts. One of the negative aspects of concomitant radiation and chemotherapy can be disproportionately increased toxicity of such treatment to healthy tissues. Indication for this combination therapy must be carefully and individually considered with respect to the overall state and intercurrent diseases of a particular patient. The effectiveness of brachytherapy has been observed in both prospective and retrospective studies. In the case of distal extrahepatic carcinoma, it has contributed to prolonging median survival to the range of 10-14 months. The largest study was published in 2010 by Shinohara et al., analyzing 193 patients with cholangiocarcinomas treated with brachytherapy. The overall median survival was up to 11 months, while it reached to only 4 months in a large control group without radiotherapy (6,859 patients) . Brachytherapy, while prolonging stent patency, can provide longer patient survival times and improve the quality of life. Brachytherapy can be used as a solitary source of radiation therapy to prevent reocclusion. In a prospective study, Chen et al. applied HDR brachytherapy after insertion of self-expandable metal stents. A significantly longer stent patency duration was achieved in patients undergoing brachytherapy (12.6 vs. 8.3 months) . Long-term patency of metal stents was also achieved by Park et al. on administering external radiotherapy only at a dose of 45-50 Gy. Another option enabling HRD delivery is the use of iodine-125 seeds (radioactive half-life of 60 days), which could be permanently implanted in tissues with an effective radiation radius of 20 mm. Stranded seeds in a 4-F tube retained by a metal stent or seeds attached directly to the stent structure could be employed. Rather smaller randomized study groups showed prolonged patency rate of metal stents and survival of patients with malignant biliary obstruction.",

(4): 480-485. Introduction Biliary obstruction is a common problem in various HPB malignancies. Significant number of such patients turn to be unsuitable for radical surgery and thus, need palliation for jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) with stent placement has been documented to be an effective palliation for malignant biliary obstruction. However, occlusion of the stent is frequently observed because of tumor in-growth, epithelial hyperplasia, and sludge deposits. To increase the duration of stent patency and exert local tumor destruction local ablative therapy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) might be used. RFA has been widely accepted as an effective and safe treatment option in oncology practice, but traditional RF devices cannot be used to treat the biliary tree tumours, perihilar obstructing proximal bile duct tumours, or distal duct obstructing tumors. Therefore, Habib\u2122 percutaneous HPB (EMcision Ltd, London, UK) endoluminal device that can be introduced into the bile duct lumen over the wire was developed.",

We will outline physical aspects of the endoluminal RF device; rationale of its application in the bile duct; endobiliary RFA technique, including device delivery methods to the biliary tree target area and power; and time of RF processing. Main indications and outcome, including possible complications, will be discussed. Technical characteristics of the endoluminal RF device: Habib\u2122 HPB is a single use, disposable, bipolar 8-F catheter with a different working length (90 cm or 180 cm) depending on the method of device introduction into the \"target\" area: the percutaneous or endoscopic approach. The device is positioned in the bile duct obstructed segment for coagulation and ablation of the tissue. A radiofrequency power is applied to the electrodes at the tip of the catheter so that heat is applied to the tissue surrounding the catheter. The device comprises a catheter with 2 contact electrodes that create a cylindrical coagulation/ablation in the radius of up to 10 mm around the electrodes of the inserted device at a length of approximately 2.5 cm, causing coagulation necrosis of the bile duct obstructing tumor. The RFA device is connected to a compatible radiofrequency generator. The logic of this approach is that intraductal RFA may prolong stent patency, achieve local tumor control, destroy small tumor volume, and palliate large tumors in conjunction with chemotherapy. The important point is that the RF-mediated antitumor immune response, generated by the wide spectrum tumor antigen released on RFA processing, causes massive death of the tumor cells by coagulation necrosis. Indications for biliary RFA are quite similar to those defined for inoperable patients when biliary stenting is used for palliation. Malignant biliary strictures might be caused by a variety of malignant problems, such as cholangiocarcinoma; different types of primary liver tumors; metastasis; and gallbladder, pancreatic, and papilla of Vater carcinoma. If the biliary stricture is caused by malignancy, which is not removable surgically, endobiliary RF processing acts as an important adjunct for widely accepted stent positioning alone, enabling partial destruction of the bile duct obstructing tumor by coagulation necrosis and at the same time, having a potential to \"switch on\" the antitumor immune response. Biliary RFA might also be used to recanalize stents obstructed by tumor ingrowth into the stent lumen.",

            "text": "The biliary RFA procedure might be performed using endoscopic or percutaneous approaches under deep venous sedation. The initial steps repeat the technique of an ordinary stent placement, including conduction of the wire through the strictured bile duct segment; as the 0.035-inch-diameter wire is successfully conducted, an 8-Fr-diameter bipolar RF device is advanced over the wire under real-time fluoroscopy guidance and positioned in the strictured duct segment; the stiff wire is helpful in cases where the stricture is very tight. The RF processing with a power of 10-15 watts for 2 minutes is applied to cause coagulation necrosis of the bile duct obstructing tumor. Number of ablation sessions depends on the stricture length; usually, 1 or 2 sessions are used as the biliary RFA device processing length is approximately 2 cm. The procedure is completed with the placement of a metal stent of an appropriate diameter (usually 8-10 mm) over the wire. If self-expanding stents (SEMS) are used, stricture pre-dilation is recommended to exclude the problem of the stent opening on its release, when stent radial force is not enough to overcome tight stenosis. If the stent does not open completely, balloon post-dilation might be easily performed. Details of the endoscopic approach: the endoscopic procedure is a straightforward, one-step intervention; the procedure success is documented by visual observation of bile passage from the recanalized bile duct and/or by opacification of the biliary tree by contrast injection. Details of the percutaneous approach: the percutaneous procedure might be performed as a one-or two-step intervention. In the onestep intervention, PTBD and biliary RFA with subsequent stenting are completed in one session. In the two-step intervention, the first step is PTBD and biliary recanalization by RFA and stenting is performed 1 or 2 weeks later. The percutaneous biliary RFA procedure is terminated by repositioning the transhepatic catheter \"above\" the positioned stent; the catheter is left closed to have access to the biliary tree in case patency is not restored completely. The catheter is removed a few days later following recheck cholangiography.",

            "text": "Patients were followed up every 2 weeks for 1 month and as per the oncology follow-up protocol thereafter; they underwent clinical examination, liver function tests, and ultrasound scans to rule out cholangitis or biliary obstruction. The key point for achieving technical success in the biliary RFA procedure is conduction of the wire across the stricture; therefore, the technical success rate is actually identical to that with ordinary biliary recanalization by stent placement. To understand the clinical success of the procedure, we need to emphasize the importance of coagulation necrosis of the bile duct obstructing tumor resulting in improved patient survival, as reported by few published papers. Biliary RFA is quite safe and feasible procedure; the only possible significant complication is the perforation of the bile duct with bile leakage because of damage in the extrahepatic bile duct intact segment during RF processing, a possibility that cannot be excluded and can be easily documented on the procedure itself by contrast injection. Usually, normal biliary patency restoration by stent placement is sufficient and addition of antibiotics practically excludes the need of surgery in the management of this complication. Hemorrhage is extremely rare as vessel wall thermal injury is practically excluded by the heat-sinking effect (cooling by blood flow). Subsequently, patients are referred to the oncologists for further management. Discussion RFA has been used to achieve localized tumor necrosis in solid neoplasms for many years. It delivers a high amount of thermal energy to the target tissue with curative or palliative intent, but thus far, the intraductal application of RFA has not been considered because of the expected complication of thermal biliary damage, such as bile leakage or biliary stricture. The thermal effect on bile duct has been regarded as the cause of post-RFA biliary stricture. This is the case whenever the energy is delivered to the \"outside\" of the bile ducts. Here, in contrast, the energy was delivered \"inside\" the biliary system where the Habib\u2122 Percutaneous HPB takes advantage of the radiofrequency thermal effect as a means to locally destroy the malignant biliary stricture by delivering low radiofrequency energy from 2 electrodes to ensure that the energy is evenly spread around the endoluminal device before the metal stent is positioned. Local coagulation necrosis caused by RFA has the potential to delay tumor growth which might be partially due to RF induced immune response and may prolong the duration of stent patency, finally improving the overall survival. The endoscopic or percutaneous approach can cover all cases when biliary RFA is needed; each approach has advantages and the more suitable one should be chosen in every case. The advantage of the endoscopic approach is relative low invasiveness (no puncture required). Advantages of the percutaneous approach is the possibility of two-step performance (particularly important in cases with long-standing jaundice and cholangitis), lesser physical distance to the area of interest which enables easier and more effective C RSE manipulation with wires and catheters, and the possibility of maintaining an immediate and easier access to the processed area after the completion of the procedure which enables easy repetition of the procedure, if needed. Biliary tract RFA in patients with unresectable, malignant biliary obstruction is a feasible and effective treatment option. Further randomized studies to determine the efficacy of intraductal RFA therapy on long-term biliary stent patency and patient survival are warranted. 3 . To learn about interdisciplinary patient care for long term success Peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) is an interesting short-to-mid-term type of central venous catheter that can be implanted by physicians and specially trained nurses. New techniques, such as integrated magnetic tip tracking and ECG-controlled tip placement, offer new options for catheter placement by nurses and physicians in dedicated patients. Because PICC placement uses a peripheral, relatively superficial and small vein for implantation, PICC placement can be safely performed in patients with haemorrhagic disorders. Ultrasound-guided venipuncture and a modified Seldinger technique with a peel-away sheath are standards in PICC implantation. Creating a short subcutaneous tunnel to reduce infectious complications is a recent development in PICC placement.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the advantages of tunnelled catheters compared to other access devices 2. To learn tricks for successful placement 3. To learn tricks for successful management Tunneled devices are characterized by the fact that their insertion site on the skin and site of ultimate venipuncture are physically separated. Long-term venous catheters became available in 1968, and the design was improved by Dr. John W. Broviac in 1973. 1 Hickman et al. further modified the principles in 1979 with subcutaneous tunneling and a Dacron cuff that formed an infection barrier and promoted fibrous ingrowth to prevent catheter migration. 2 Tunneled cuffed catheters (TCCs) provide reliable and instant longterm intravenous access for a large variety of therapeutic purposes, including chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and apheresis. The most frequent application is as an access device for hemodialysis (HD) in patients with renal failure. 3 Even though native arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are considered the best vascular access option for HD, 4 TCCs are the initial access for approximately 80% of patients in the USA and 30% of patients in Europe who are starting HD. 5-6-24 It is mandatory to focus on the use of TCCs for HD considering that dialysis catheters represent the most commonly placed tunneled central venous catheters. However the main principles and techniques of TCC placement for HD are applicable to devices, such as the Hickman, Broviac, Groshong, or tunneled peripherally inserted central catheters, that are used for different purpose. 7 Familiarity with basic concepts of the devices and procedural techniques are crucial for achieving successful long-term venous access. The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines were first published in 1997 and provide extensive clinical practice guidelines for vascular access including tunneled central venous catheter for dialysis. 8 This document has provided guidelines named \"clinical practice recommendations (CPRs)\" that are evidence-and opinion-based statements. According to the NKF-KDOQI guidelines, tunneled cuffed venous catheters are indicated for temporary venous access that is expected to be required for longer than 3 weeks. In the HD setting, tunneled catheters should serve as bridging devices during the maturation of newly placed arterio-venous fistulas, especially for patients with end-stage renal disease who are admitted with an urgent need for dialysis or as the final option in patients in whom fistulas and grafts are contraindicated or have failed. However, functioning permanent access at the initiation of HD confers lower mortality than that in patients temporized with a tunneled cuffed venous catheter while awaiting the maturation of permanent access. 5 The preferred insertion site for tunneled cuffed venous dialysis catheters or port catheter systems is the right internal jugular vein. 8 Other options include the right external jugular vein, 9 left internal and external jugular veins, subclavian veins, femoral veins, and translumbar and transhepatic access to the IVC. Subclavian access should be used only when no other upper-extremity or chest-wall options are available. If possible, TCCs should not be placed on the same side as a maturing AV access. Tunneled cuffed venous catheters should be placed preferentially in the right internal jugular vein because this site offers a more direct route to the caval-atrial junction than the left-sided great veins. Catheter insertion and maintenance in the right internal jugular vein are associated with a lower risk of complications than those at other potential catheter insertion sites. 10 Catheter placement in the left internal jugular vein potentially puts the left arm's vasculature in jeopardy. Catheter placement in the left internal jugular vein is associated with poor blood flow rates and high rates of stenosis and thrombosis. Catheter placement in the femoral and translumbar veins is associated with higher infection rates than placement at other sites. 11 Ultrasound should be used in catheter placement. The NKF-KDOQI guidelines state that fluoroscopy is mandatory for the insertion of all cuffed dialysis catheters. The position of the tip of any central catheter should be radiologically verified. Ultrasound insertion has been shown to limit insertion complications. Evidence is sufficient to recommend the use of ultrasound guidance for all insertions because it minimizes inadvertent arterial cannulation. [12] [13] Fluoroscopy allows ideal catheter tip placement to maximize blood flow. 14 In recent literature reviews and the most current iteration of KDOQI guidelines, the recommended catheter tip position was in the \"mid-atrium with arterial lumen facing the mediastinum.\" [15] [16] However, even these recommendations are marred by inaccuracy because they make no distinction between the different tip designs of the currently available dialysis catheters and dynamic interplay between catheter function, side hole design, and resulting complications. Considering the functional tip as the part of the catheter from the most proximal side hole to the catheter tip, the entire functional length should be placed in the right atrium, but not too deep, to avoid touching the floor of the right atrium. There is currently no proven advantage of one cuffed catheter design over another. Catheters capable of a rapid blood flow rate are preferred. Catheter choice should be based on local experience, goals for use, and cost. Systemic sepsis is an absolute contraindication for central venous access via TCCs because it can lead to line infection. In septic patients who require a long-term tunneled line for a reason other than intravenous antibiotic administration, new permanent access should not be placed until culture results have been negative. Relative contraindications include local cellulitis and abnormal coagulation results, including prothrombin time INR of >1.5 and markedly decreased platelet count (<60.000/mm 3 ). However, in select cases, there is a need to deviate from these general guidelines if clinically warranted. Even with care, fewer than half the catheters placed as \"long-term access\" are in use a year after their placement, 17 and approximately a third are removed because they fail to deliver adequate blood flow. The definition of adequate blood flow varies inversely with the \"efficiency\" of HD. High-efficiency dialysis, as that practiced in the United States, requires dialyzer-delivered BFRs > 300 mL/min to achieve the target single-pool Kt/V of 1.2 (see the KDOQI HD Adequacy Guidelines). Conversely, in Europe, BFRs < 300 mL/min are frequently used because dialysis treatment durations are longer. 18 The adequacy of dialysis is also influenced by the site of placement and degree of recirculation. 19 Recirculation is significantly greater in femoral catheters than in internal jugular catheters (13.1% versus 0.4%; P < 0.001). In addition, femoral catheters <20 cm have significantly greater recirculation (26.3%) than those >20 cm (8.3%; P = 0.007). This length dependency may result from the ultimate tip position of longer catheters in the IVC as opposed to the common iliac vein with shorter catheters. The high blood flow available to the catheter at the IVC site reduces recirculation. Recirculation may increase when the \"lines are reversed\" (inversion of inlet and outlet lumens), even in \"well-functioning\" non-split catheters (from 2%-3% to >10%). All catheters are \"locked\" with some anticoagulant. The purpose of the lock is to prevent thrombosis. The loss of anticoagulant by diffusive transport would be expected. The lost locking solution is replaced by blood. Therefore, it is not surprising that thrombosis is common in catheters because blood is likely to be in the lumen of the catheter for prolonged interdialytic times. The loss of anticoagulant permits the entry of clotting factors into the catheter lumen. The presence of these processes is manifested by a change in flow long before occlusion occurs. After assessment precludes mechanical dysfunction, such as a kink or dislodgement, thrombotic occlusion, partial (poor flow on aspiration) or total (unable to aspirate or push), is the most common cause of catheter dysfunction and/or occlusion. Catheter dysfunction can be attributed to many causes, and the progression of dysfunction to non-function varies accordingly. The most common complications are thrombosis and infection. [20] [21] The need to use a Trendelenburg position to achieve adequate blood flow from a catheter placed in great veins leading to the right atrium always implies that the catheter is improperly placed. If the problem is not obvious and not easily correctable, the patient should be referred to an interventional center for diagnosing the cause. Although mechanical problems can develop acutely in catheters previously exhibiting good performance, access dysfunction occurring after 2 weeks is more likely because of progressive occlusion of the catheter tip by fibrin or thrombus. The location of obstruction may be as follows:",

Although endoluminal brushes have been used to clear thrombi from dialysis catheters, 22 there are no convincing data their efficacy. Such brushes were originally developed to obtain biofilm specimens from catheters. Currently, the Work Group recommends the change of catheter with the disruption of the sheath using a balloon. Fibrin sheath stripping is rarely used because of high cost and increased patient morbidity. Although thrombotic occlusions leading to flow delivery problems are more common than infection, catheter-related infection has emerged as the primary barrier to long-term catheter use. The greater infection rate in catheters than in grafts and fistulae is its major limitation. Infection is the leading cause of catheter removal and morbidity in dialysis patients. 23 The rate of septicemia in HD patients and hospital admissions for vascular access infection is still a matter of concern. 24 Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is the major reason for catheter loss and has been associated with substantial morbidity, including metastatic infection. It is a life-threatening condition requiring initial hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic therapy if the patient is clinically septic. The observation in a large trial of patients with CRB in whom systemic antibiotics alone could salvage <25% of catheters 25 led to the commonly used \"salvage of site rather than salvage of catheter\" approach. 26 Conversely, in studies using catheter guide wire exchange in stable patients without tunnel involvement, using antibiotics alone salvaged 80%-88% of sites without apparent ill effects. 27 In such a setting, there is no advantage in delaying the replacement of the catheter by several days. 26 Bacteremia with tunnel-tract involvement should prompt catheter removal. Unstable patients require catheter removal for rapid response to therapy. The KDOQI Work Group believes that a minimum of 3 weeks of systemic antibiotic therapy is needed to treat CRB and that new permanent access should not be placed until culture results have been negative for at least 48 hours after the cessation of antibiotic therapy. 8 Preventing CRB can be difficult despite the use of rigorous infection control techniques. Gentamicin/citrate solution and a taurolidine solution used as interdialytic antibiotic locks are effective. 28 The overall risk of TCCs infection can be reduced by adopting costeffective, evidence-based interventions, such as proper education and specific training of the staff, an adequate hand-washing policy, proper choices of the type of device and the site of insertion, use of maximal barrier protection during insertion, use of chlorhexidine as an antiseptic prior to insertion and for disinfecting the exit site thereafter, appropriate policies for the dressing of the exit site, routine changes of administration sets, and removal of central lines as soon as they are no longer necessary. 29 To prevent infection, stringent cleaning of the catheter insertion site is advised. Chlorhexidine appears to be twice as effective as povidone-iodine solution. Although there is a wealth of literature focused on placement, infection prevention, and maintenance of catheter patency, circumstances and indications for TCCs removal are less well understood. Catheters in the inpatient setting were commonly removed for proven or clinically suspected infections. The timely removal of these catheters is an important management decision, with the length of TDC duration representing the largest cumulative risk factor for catheter-associated blood stream infections. 30 the prevention and early treatment of complications should greatly reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Tunneled cuffed venous catheters are essential tools for providing urgent and, in some cases, long-term vascular access. High-quality vascular access should be a hallmark of interventional radiology. CVC dysfunction is not infrequent and may occur in 3%-30% of patients [3] [4] [5] . The most common causes of catheter dysfunction include occlusion from medication or clot, fibrin sheath formation at the catheter tip and adherence to the vessel wall. Other causes include catheter migration and central venous obstruction. Occlusion from medication occurs due to inappropriate concentrations or incompatible mixtures of infusions that cause medications to precipitate within the catheter lumen; for example, if calcium and phosphorus are co-administered, calcium phosphate crystals form and precipitate in the catheter lumen. The presence of alkaline or acidic pH further influences crystal formation and precipitation. Adherence to the vessel wall occurs mainly due to continuous trauma to the venous wall from the catheter tip that leads to localized thrombosis around it. However, even if the catheter is not abutting the vessel wall, thrombus develops in the catheter tip due to intravascular protein and cell deposition. This process begins almost immediately after catheter placement because of the deposition of albumin, lipoprotein, and fibrinogen around the catheter tip that creates a protein sleeve [6] . The well-known fibrin cap or fibrin sheath at the catheter tip is formed after platelets and coagulation factors are recruited in the area. In cases of central venous access dysfunction, mechanical obstruction needs to be first excluded by imaging. Plain X-ray imaging is usually recommended prior to contrast injection to exclude any severe kinking or migration of the catheter tip. If the catheter is in position, a linogram study under aseptic technique is suggested to assess viability. In such cases, contrast is injected through the catheter lumen and a digital subtraction angiography is performed. In case of the presence of a fibrin sheath, a typical pseudoenlargement sign presents at the catheter tip because of the refluxes of contrast within the fibrin sheath or a pouch at the catheter tip may be formed instead.",

            "text": "If the catheter is blocked or is adherent to the vessel wall, several methods can be used to restore functionality. In case of parenteral nutrition, several agents may be injected in the catheter lumen to unblock it. If the blockage is due to precipitants of low-pH medication, 0.1% hydrochloric acid may be injected, although the catheter wall may get damaged [7] . If high-pH medications are likely to have caused the obstruction, sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide may be applied. In case of lipid precipitants, 70% ethanol solution may be used, which provides reasonable results [8, 9] . If there is no blockage from precipitants and the linogram has revealed the presence of intraluminal clot or fibrin sheath, a small amount of a thrombolytic drug (i.e., 2 mg of alteplase) may be applied or endovascular removal of the fibrin sheath may be performed. This latter maneuver involves obtaining access from a brachial or femoral vein and advancing a snare around the catheter that is then closed with moderate tension to clean the fibrin sheath from the catheter. The technique has been described with a high success rate in various reports [10] [11] [12] . Another technique that has been described for the salvage of failing CVCs due to adhesion in the venous wall is mechanical adhesiolysis that involves the use of a pigtail catheter that is twisted multiple times around the stuck catheter to break the adhesion to the vessel wall [10] . In some cases, a more radical approach, such as the use of biopsy forceps, might also help to mobilize the catheter. In case of migration of the central catheter tip, a snare can also be used to reposition the tip. In such cases, although the underlying cause, which is usually the short length of the catheter, probably leads to further migration, the solution provided is only for short term. Nevertheless, endovascular techniques tend to increase the overall patency time of the central lines, without the need of a complete revision. In case of an underlying venous obstruction, venoplasty may be performed. It needs to be considered that recoil might occur after balloon angioplasty and that stent deployment may also be required in selected cases.",

            "text": "The complications of the endovascular revision of CVCs are very limited and mainly involve catheter tip dislodgement during stripping or venous laceration and catheter kinking during adhesiolysis. Pulmonary embolism may also be considered as a potential complication after extensive catheter manipulation [13] . Overall, endovascular techniques appear to offer a valid solution of revision and salvage and to prolong the patency of failing (OS) in the range of only 1 year in the modern era of cytotoxic chemotherapy. With the utilization of targeted therapies and immunotherapy in the induction/first-and second-line settings, OS has improved for subsets of patients. However, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have varying degrees of success depending on tumor expression of various molecules, including mutant EGFR and fusion ALK and PD-L1. Furthermore, survival outcomes for NSCLC tend to lag behind those for other major primary cancers. Ultimately, for a significant proportion of patients with stage IV NSCLC, systemic agents offer limited potential for durable control of disease. Advanced by Weichselbaum and Hellman, the concept of oligometastatic disease has gained increasing attention. Oligometastatic disease represents a state of malignancy with limited metastases (traditionally 3 or fewer) between local and widely disseminated disease. Historically, with limited metastatic colorectal cancer and sarcomas, the use of local therapies including surgery or/and radiation with cytotoxic agents have become a part of the standard of care as a means of drastically improving OS along with local control. It, therefore, poses a question, as we try to identify more and more subsets of patients with advanced NSCLC with favorable biology, if there is a group of patients with limited metastatic NSCLC who could benefit from local treatments in addition to their systemic therapy regimens. If so, what would be the optimal treatments, when should they be delivered, and what type of benefit is realistic. This concept of combining local therapy with systemic therapy becomes more relevant with data showing original sites of gross disease as first sites of failure following systemic agents for advanced NSCLC.",

            "text": "Major arguments for aggressive local treatment of metastatic disease in the modern setting include the general lack of ability of systemic therapy to \"cure\" solid tumors, failures most commonly presenting in the original sites of gross disease; the heterogeneity in response to systemic therapy secondary to disease biology; and the reduced effectiveness of subsequent lines of systemic agents. All of these points collectively support an argument where a local therapy might enhance overall tumor control because local therapies are more effective at reducing tumor bulk, are less likely to be rendered ineffective by multidrug resistance mutations, and may reduce further metastases by successful gross tumor control. Over the last several years, a number of groups and institutions have begun to be more aggressive with treatments for oligometastatic/ limited metastatic NSCLC by combining local therapies with chemotherapies, targeted agents, and immunotherapies. Local therapy could include surgery, radiation, and radiofrequency ablation. In the ascending order, local control improves when comparing radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and surgical lobectomy; however, despite enhanced local control, the rate of distant disease remains highly variable between studies and between therapies. Because of its significant capacity for local control over other ablative modalities in a non-invasive and safe/minimal toxicity approach, SBRT has been adopted as the local therapy of choice in a large number of institutions for treating oligometastatic disease in consolidation or salvage for oligoprogression. Data from multiple types of experiences (retrospective analyses, meta-analyses, and institutional experiences) had until recently supplied the rationale to support potential progression-free survival (PFS) and OS and control benefits in patients with limited metastatic NSCLC compared with historical outcomes. In non-randomized prospective approaches, there is always a question of whether oligometastatic disease represents a biological entity with a more indolent disease course, i.e., fewer sites of progression or metastasis, resulting in improved survival independent of treatment management. However, prospective singlearm trials and now smaller randomized phase II trials are starting to validate and solidify a possible PFS benefit of local therapy added to systemic agents in oligometastatic lung cancer. The question will be if this PFS benefit will translate into an OS advantage. NRG LU002, a phase II/III clinical trial, has recently been activated in North America and will randomize 300 patients with limited metastatic NSCLC who have stable disease/response after first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy to either maintenance chemotherapy alone or SBRT to all sites of limited metastases (and SBRT or hypofractionated radiation to the primary) followed by maintenance chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study will be OS. As approved for first-line or maintenance regimens, immunotherapies will be permitted for NRG LU002 as systemic approaches, with the same question of the radiation's role in consolidation being asked. Ultimately, NRG LU002 should provide the answer to how important local therapy is to oligometastatic disease. This talk at the CIRSE conference will provide an overview of the benefits of using SBRT in oligometastatic NSCLC. We will review the current data to date supporting SBRT use and offer prognostications as to the direction it will be used in the future for this patient population. There will certainly be an effort to distinguish its benefits over the use of radiofrequency or other ablative techniques. Portal vein embolization (PVE) is performed in order to induce contralateral hypertrophy before extended hepatectomy. PVE has existed for nearly 25 years and is performed worldwide with various techniques and embolic products. Safety issues have been raised pertaining to performing PVE from the contralateral side, as previously described. These issues are more theoretical because very few complications have been reported in the future remnant liver after contralateral PVE. Compared with TARE, PVE is more rapid in inducing hypertrophy and has a very low failure rate both in cirrhotic and metastatic patients. In a candidate for extended resection, there is no data supporting the test of time of waiting for 3 months for hypertrophy being a safe strategy after TARE. Patients developing new liver tumors during this waiting period might benefit from a faster surgery, while others argue that these patients probably are poor surgical candidates. Recent technical developments seem to improve the results of PVE, such as hepatic vein embolization simultaneously performed during PVE and PVE associated with percutaneous ALLPS by radio frequency ablation of the surgical dissection plane. These early results need to be confirmed in the future. Of course, unlike TARE, PVE is not a therapeutic procedure for tumors located in the future remnant liver; this is probably the main difference between the 2 methods. Although it seems logical to use TARE when tumor downstaging is recommended before considering resection (e.g., HCC with portal vein segmental invasion and a small future remnant liver), there is no definite reason to defend TARE against PVE in other situations; TARE is much more expensive and delays surgery.",

            "text": "1. To learn about the role of IR in percutaneous treatment of pancreatitis 2. To learn about the optimal approach and drainage techniques in pancreatitis 3. To learn how percutaneous drainage can facilitate minimally invasive surgery for pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is a severe condition due to inflammation of the pancreatic gland that is self-limiting in 80% of cases, while in the remaining cases, it is called complicated acute pancreatitis and can lead to tissue necrosis and abscess or pseudocyst formation. In complicated cases, the optimal treatment strategy depends on the lesions and clinical conditions and symptoms and ranges from medical therapy to surgical drainage or pancreatic necrosectomy. Endoscopy has a primary role in the management of complicated acute pancreatitis. It allows treating the underlying causes of the disease, such as pancreatobiliary calculosis, stenosis, and malformation; moreover, thanks to the introduction of echo-endoscopy, it permits fluid collection or pseudocyst drainage through the visceral wall. Nevertheless, surgery that theoretically is the optimal strategy because it allows the removal of all the necrotic tissue and collections with different techniques can lead to severe complications, especially in sick patients. Image-guided percutaneous management is a valid option that in the majority of cases, allows results similar to surgery, without opening the peritoneal cavity. There are different image-guided approaches for complicated acute pancreatitis depending on the type of lesion. Image-guided catheter placement is generally the basic approach for fluid collection secondary to acute pancreatitis and can be performed using computed tomography (CT), Dyna-CT, or ultrasound guidance. Peripancreatic simple fluid collection can be easily drained using a single catheter, but in most cases, multiple catheters have to be placed in order to aspirate all the fluid and to allow continue flushing of the cavity with saline solution. Percutaneous necrosectomy is another option that can be used in case of a large amount of tissue necrosis using different type of catheters and devices. Pancreatic pseudocyst is a long-term outcome of acute pancreatitis and is defined as a collection of pancreatic juice limited by a fibrotic wall due to disruption of the pancreatic duct. The treatment of this is condition is based on symptoms that are fortunately rare and are generally mass related, such as dysphagia due to compression of the stomach or the duodenum. This lesion cannot be drained through standard fluid collection because of the continuous pancreatic juice secretion in the cyst forcing long-term percutaneous catheter placement. Being inspired by the endoscopic procedure of pseudocyst gastrostomy and by surgery, a long-term intentional fistula between the pseudocyst and the stomach can be created with a percutaneous approach in order to maintain drainage of the cyst into the viscera. To learn how to treat vascular complications of pancreatitis Pancreatitis can range from between a mild and self-limited to a severe and life-threatening disease, and it is estimated that around one quarter of patients may develop some sort of vascular complication, although an accurate incidence is not known. Venous thrombosis involving the splenic, mesenteric, or portal veins is the most frequent vascular complication. Pseudoaneurysm formation is the second most frequent vascular complication of pancreatitis, resulting from vessel erosion, usually caused by pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis. The most commonly involved vessels are the splenic, gastroduodenal, and pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Pseudoaneurysms are not an early complication because they take time to develop; however, they are associated with high mortality rates due to the risk of rupture, ranging from around 12% if treated to >90% if untreated. Hemorrhage is as a life-threatening complication of pancreatitis, which may occur with or without the prior formation of a pseudoaneurysm after surgical intervention or as a consequence of the formation of varices and may occur in the peritoneal cavity, extraperitoneum, or gastrointestinal tract or directly in the Wirsung duct. Both multiphase contrast-enhanced CT or MRI are suitable techniques in the diagnosis of vascular complications of pancreatitis, including image acquisition in the arterial and portal venous phases. CT remains particularly useful for suspected hemorrhagic complications because it is faster and more accessible in the urgent or emergent setting. Angiography is the gold-standard imaging strategy, although it is not usually used initially, and allows the localization and treatment of the bleeding site. In some cases, angiography may be unable to detect the source of bleeding due to venous bleeding, intermittent arterial bleeding, or bleeding from a large surface area. Interventional radiologists play a crucial role in the treatment of vascular complications of pancreatitis. Surgery is indicated in the presence of hemodynamic instability. Embolization is the most frequent first-line treatment in patients with acute hemorrhage or peri-pancreatic pseudoaneurysms using a variety of embolic agents, such as coils and glue. \"Back-door\" and \"front-door\" embolizations are usually required to ensure isolation of the bleeding site due to the abundant peri-pancreatic collateral circulation. Occasionally, it may not be possible to catheterize the small and tortuous culprit vessels, although technical advances with microcatheters and guidewires have largely surpassed this limitation. During these minimally invasive procedures, from one to several probes are placed in the target lesion under imaging (computed tomography or ultrasound) guidance. The energy is then directly deposited by the ablation needle(s) into the target lesion to yield tumor cell death. The success of this treatment modality is directly related to the ability to induce both destruction of the tumor and potential microsatellites around it. Thus, not only the lesion itself but also the circumferential rim of the normal-appearing parenchyma around the tumor need to be ablated. To accomplish this, precise positioning of probes is critical. Some of the many parameters that may influence lesion targeting precision are lesion depth/localization, patient's corpulence, quality and reliability of the imaging guidance, radiologist's experience, and motion of the lesion-bearing organs. A usual ablative procedure, such as RFA, is performed under general anesthesia. To obtain immobility of tumor lesions for better targeting, intermittent apnea can be requested to the anesthesiologist. However, intermittent apnea proved to be impractical and may complicate needle positioning. General anesthesia with highfrequency jet ventilation (HFJV) has been recently introduced and has revolutionized the field of tumor ablation. HFJV is a mechanical ventilation method where high-flow, short-duration pulses of pressurized gas are delivered to the trachea through a small caliber catheter. Gas exchange is assured by high-velocity gas flow washing the alveoli. Because HFJV is made of short and small pulses of air, it induces very small amplitude respiratory movements. The diaphragmatic excursions are thus greatly reduced allowing for virtually no abdominal organ motion. This not only greatly helps in precise lesion targeting but also helps in per-procedure evaluation of treatment efficacy [e.g., by comparing same level CT (due to HFJV) obtained before and immediately after the ablation]. Moreover, the use HFJV is particularly appealing for needle positioning using stereotactic navigation systems which are increasingly used in tumor ablation. As any technique, HFJV has its own limitations and contraindications, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, recent pneumothorax, or pulmonary surgery. These contraindications are not absolute and the risk of the anesthesia could be weighted by the potential benefit of the procedure. According to our experience, HFJV can be used in majority patients. It is, therefore, crucial to establish a close collaboration with the anesthesiologists to perform HFJV in adequately selected patients to improve tumor targeting and treatment efficacy. C RSE advantages than disadvantages in using RA techniques: lower pain scores, reduced side effects (nausea and vomiting, pruritus, drowsiness and sedation) associated with opioid use and successful management of challenging clinical cases. 1 Between 1884, the year when Carl Koller performed the first regional block for eye surgery in Vienna, and the late 1970s, the main developments were pertaining to new local anaesthetic drugs and the introduction of anatomical/landmark methods for nerve identification. Unfortunately, anatomy is not exactly predictable, and the natural variability of human anatomy led to poor success rates for many peripheral nerve blocks (PNB). Much of the antipathy pertaining to regional anaesthesia has its origins in the arguably 'hit and miss' times. Part of this may also be associated with a lack of understanding of the anatomy. During these times, RA was appreciated more as an art than a science; anaesthesiologists would extrapolate the location of a target nerve/plexus uniquely based on the identification of relevant surface landmarks. General application was imperfect due to limited training, lack of understanding of the anatomy, bad patient positioning or other inconsistencies even after the advent of electrical stimulation for nerve localisation. 2 On the other hand, peripheral nerve stimulation is neither precise nor perfect; it is possible to elicit paraesthesia or be intraneural with the needle without producing any motor response. 3 Ultrasound-assisted (USA) and ultrasound-guided (USG) RA techniques were introduced in the late 70s when La Grange et al. used a Doppler ultrasound blood flow detector to localise the third division of the subclavian artery, making the supraclavicular approach to the brachial plexus safer and highly successful. 4 Two decades later, Kapral et al. described the USG supraclavicular approach for RA of the brachial plexus. 5 In the following 10 years, the ultrasound technology advanced in parallel with the understanding of its practice and the development of block techniques, which suited its use. The increased interest and investment in ultrasound led manufacturers to design machines specifically for RA and software to facilitate PNB. Better quality images should produce better quality blocks. 6 The interest and popularity of USG RA for both adult and paediatric patients and special patients (e.g. obese and obstetric) has increased over the last 20 years. 2, 7, 8 There are several advantages 3 with respect to the use of USG for performing RA. There is no risk of radiation, and nerves as well as the point of division of the nerve can be easily identified. The surrounding anatomy, such as blood vessels (e.g. femoral artery), can be easily identified, which in turn can help in the identification of the nerves. Using an in plane approach, needles can be visualised as a hyperechoic line and guided towards the target nerve or structure. Real-time needle guidance can avoid inadvertent needle entry into the blood vessels, pleura or structures such as the spinal canal. Local anaesthetic spread can be appreciated under US vision; thus, if inadequate, it can be corrected or an additional injection could be made. Partial nerve blocks can be prevented by ensuring circumferential spread of the local anaesthetic. Peripheral nerve catheters can be placed under direct vision. USG nerve blocks can be a relatively painless procedure when muscle contraction is avoided, without nerve stimulation. It has been demonstrated that the success rate is higher, dose of the local anaesthetic required is lower, sensory onset time is shorter and duration of blocks is longer using USG. Block quality is significantly improved. Less incidence of diaphragmatic paralysis as less volume can be used for interscalene block. Patient groups where USG RA is particularly useful include children 8 because blocks are performed under general anaesthesia and echogenicity of tissues in children is very clear, patients with peripheral neuropathy because it is difficult to elicit nerve stimulus (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) and obese patients in whom the use of Doppler has been described or in whom the vascular landmarks cannot be easily identified.",

            "text": "USG nerve block has been described for upper limb and lower limb blocks, trunk blocks and neuraxial techniques (spinal and epidural). Disadvantages of USG nerve blocks are as follows: it is still an operator-dependent technique and the potential for post-operative nerve symptoms (PONS) remains the same as that with nerve stimulation techniques. The ultrasound machines are still expensive, although the cost is coming down. The skills and knowledge of anatomy remain the corner stones of successfully performing USG RA. Can USG be effective and reliable, improving block performance, quality and durability and reducing complications and RA side effects? USG RA has conquered a top, evidence-based place in modern anaesthesiology practice. USG regional anaesthesia and children. In a recent review, 8 there was a high quality of evidence that USG increased the success rate and block duration (peripheral an neuraxial blocks) in children. An inverse correlation between the success rate and block duration and age was also found, implying that the younger the child, the more likely she/he is to benefit from USG. In very young children, neuraxial US allows the real-time observation of needle and catheter placement and local anaesthetic spread. 9 Upper limb blocks. The blocks included are interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular and axillary plexus blocks. The American Society of Regional Anaesthesia supports that USG modestly improves surrogates for block quality and performance, including faster sensory block onset, fewer vascular punctures, faster performance time, and fewer needle passes (level Ib evidence and grade A recommendations). 9 Lower limb blocks. These mainly include sciatic, femoral, obturator, fascia iliaca and saphenous nerve blocks. The evidence supporting USG for lower limb blocks is stronger than that for upper limb blocks and USG is recommended (grade A, level of evidence Ib), with better results in the onset time, performance time, and rate of complete sensory blockade as compared with nerve stimulation techniques. 9 Truncal blocks. Truncal blocks include thoracic paravertebral, intercostal, transversus abdominis plane (TAP), rectus sheath, ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric (II/IH), PECS, quadratus lumborum and fascia transversalis blocks. 9 The use of USG with thoracic paravertebral blocks based on level IIb evidence has a grade B recommendation. Considering TAP blocks, meta-analyses published are somewhat difficult to interpret because they commingle landmark-based and USG TAP blocks. When taken together, it is suggested as a grade A (level Ia evidence) recommendation that the benefits of TAP blocks are relatively limited (reduced nausea and vomiting without consistent improvement in analgesia) as compared with those of other types of analgesia. USG II/IH is a grade A (level Ib evidence) recommendation in children compared with landmark techniques. There is limited evidence to support a US-based improvement in the rectus sheath block safety. Considering the other truncal blocks, there is insufficient evidence, particularly in terms of clinically relevant comparison to standard alternatives such as thoracic epidural analgesia or surgeon infiltration. Neuraxial blocks. USG accuracy for determining the correct lumbar interspace varies between 68% and 76% compared with radiologic imaging accuracy. Level IIa evidence supports a grade B recommendation that neuraxial US aids in the identification of interspace level more accurately than palpation but not as accurately as radiologic imaging. Actual needle insertion-to-target depths were mostly within 3 mm or less of the preliminary US measurement (level Ia evidence). 9 Grade A (level Ia evidence) recommendations support that neuraxial US has a role in improving the efficiency of lumbar neuraxial anaesthesia and in accurately predicting the depth to target. Level III evidence based on small subject numbers supports a role for neuraxial USG in reducing surrogate markers of potential neurologic injury, but evidence is inadequate to assess its effect on safety outcomes. Patient safety. USG RA does not reduce the incidence of PONS compared with other nerve localisation techniques. USG RA reduces but does not eliminate the incidence and intensity of hemidiaphragmatic paresis in an unpredictable manner. The frequency of pneumothorax has decreased with USG supraclavicular blocks. There is strong evidence regarding a significant reduction in the incidence of LAST. 9 Take home points 1 : 1) Ultrasound allows for the real-time evaluation of neural anatomy, needle position, and spread of local anaesthesia. 2) Challenging patients can be successfully approached with regional anaesthesia, specially using USG. 3) USG blocks are more accurate, reliable and effective. 4) Globally, safety is improved using USG, although PONS remains the same as that with other localisation techniques.

Pain assessment is necessary to optimize the analgesic therapy. Selfreporting scales (SRS) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) are considered the single most reliable descriptor of pain experience (1, 11) , and these scales (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) have shown similar statistical power, efficacy, and response problems (17) . Of the SRS, the visual numeric scale is particularly easy to administer, correlates well with other scales, sensitive to change, and has demonstrated success in elderly adults as well; however, it may be cumbersome in immobilized patients (12) . A purely verbal 0-10 linear numerical scale, with 0 indicating no pain at all and 10 indicating worst pain imaginable, has been validated and can be used as an alternative (21, 22) . Adequate post-procedural analgesia is necessary for the patient's comfort and to combat the deleterious stress response. Local anesthetic field and nerve blocks (23), NSAIDs, and opioids supplemented by sedatives and antiemetics remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of acute pain.",

The addition of NSAIDs can significantly improve the efficacy of opiate analgesics, reduce opiate dose, and reduce side effects. Non-opioid analgesics may be used alone or in combination with opioids and local anesthetics. Commonly used non-opioids include acetaminophen and NSAIDs. An overview is provided below. However, the risk/benefit ratio should be reconsidered when NSAIDs are used in patients with asthma who have a history of sensitivity, those with a history of peptic ulcer disease, and those on anticoagulant therapy. NSAIDs may produce or exacerbate renal insufficiency; due to this concern of addition to the deleterious effect of contrast medium on kidneys, NSAIDs should be used with caution especially in patients with pre-existing impaired renal function. It is best to limit the use of NSAIDs to typically 24-48 h postoperatively.",

In severe central nervous system toxicity, benzodiazepine, may be necessary to treat seizures.

            "text": "The limited duration of action and narrow therapeutic level of local anaesthetics makes opioids as favoured choice in pain management. Enteral route of administration carries uncertainty of absorption and slow and unpredictable action. This makes IV administration, a preferred route. If given as needed by medical personnel, patients are at risk of receiving inadequate analgesia because providers may underestimate the pain level, overestimate the opioid effect and duration, or fear opioid abuse and side effects (25) . In comparison with intermittent intramuscular or IV bolus, patient controlled analgesia (PCA) offers superior overall analgesia, especially with newer advanced PCA pumps, as it is more likely to keep stable plasma concentrations of drug within the therapeutic window, with fewer peaks and valleys of drug effect. At the same time, patients tend to use less drug and have fewer side effects. In PCA, physician has control over the choice of drug, the size of a bolus, the lockout period (time between bolus doses), and the continuous rate (if one is used). The most common potent opioids used for PCA are morphine and fentanyl (24, 33) . Being efficacious, longer acting, and generally the most familiar to staff, morphine is a sensible drug to start with. Although Fentanyl has the lowest incidence of nausea, it carries shortest duration of action. PCA is thought to enhance comfort while providing patients with a means of control (29,30), and patients have reported that PCA improves their recovery (31). This sense of control and reduced anxiety by not having to rely on another person for administration of pain relief have been shown to have psychological benefits on patients (32). PCA has been proven to be favourable option not only in middleaged but also in elderly subjects (Duggleby and Lander) (29) however, careful patient selection and patient and staff education in use of PCA is important for its success. In certain situations, such as the mentally impaired or demented and those who cannot physically operate the system, PCA cannot be reliably used. In these situations, per oral or parenteral opioids may be preferred. Epidural or intrathecal administration of opiate is available for patients expected to have very high post procedure pain levels or for patients who cannot tolerate enteral or parenteral opiate administration. This modality may be particularly helpful in treating intense post embolization pain, such as in preoperative renal embolization. Placement and removal of epidural catheters in anticoagulated patients are discouraged because of an increased risk of epidural hematoma. In situations in which this cannot be avoided, ongoing neurologic monitoring is suggested. Precautions with Opioid use. Caution should be exercised when prescribing opioids for patients who may be more sensitive to the respiratory depressive effects, such as elderly patients (26, 27) , and those with obstructive sleep apnea and in patients with decreased renal clearance where high or repeat doses may lead to higher systemic opioid concentration for prolonged duration (26) . Adverse Effects with Opioid Use. Adverse effects, relevant to post-operative period like respiratory depression and nausea are generally dose related and resolve quickly when opioid serum levels fall.",

However serious respiratory depression has been reported at an incidence of 0.5% (34). Antidote:Naloxone, naltrexone, and nalbuphine all reverse the m-opioid respiratory depressant effect. Low dose of these antagonists significantly improves ventilatory response, however high doses may be dangerous as it may unmask m opioid receptor analgesia leading to sudden emergence of high levels of pain and subsequently a massive sympathetic discharge which may result in adverse cardiac events. Similarly, duration of action of m-antagonist is less than that of a m agonist, therefor the patient should be monitored for a longer period until it is unlikely that respiratory depression will recur. Nausea Narcotics directly stimulates central chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla and may lead to nausea and vomiting, particularly when the dose exceeds that required for analgesia in a given patient. This effect varies with opioids f.ex. morphine produce more nausea and vomiting than fentanyl. However, it should also be kept in mind that untreated pain can also stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone and result in nausea (28) . Conclusion: Visual analogue scale is preferred method of pain assessment and reliable analgesia is predominantly oriented around opioids, preferably through PCA. Intravenous injection of local anaesthetics especially bupivacaine should be avoided. NSAIDs are not recommended at least first two days. The new European Directive 2013/59/Euratom on basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation is expected to have a relevant impact on the European diagnostic and interventional radiology. The directive was adopted by the Council of the European Union (EU) on 5 December 2013. Member States of the EU shall complete the transposition of the directive into national legislation by 6 February 2018. After the transposition, the implementation of the new requirements will be a challenge for the interventional practices in Europe, but it is expected to substantially improve the radiation safety for patients and professionals. The most relevant changes in the new directive (with impact on interventional practices) may be summarized as follows: 1. use and regular review of diagnostic reference levels (DRLs), including interventional procedures; 2. education and training in radiation protection; 3. responsibilities (involvement of several professionals in optimisation); 4. role of medical physics experts (MPEs); 5. new requirements for equipment; 6. procedures (optimisation process); and 7. registry and analysis of accidental or unintended exposures. The most relevant change in occupational exposures is the new annual limit for the lens of the eyes. The use and regular review of DRLs is a new requirement. Appropriate local reviews are needed whenever DRLs are consistently exceeded and require corresponding corrective action without undue delay. The impact of complexity factors when setting DRLs in interventional procedures will be a challenge.",

            "text": "Fewer than 10% of the interventional radiology and interventional cardiology trainees are females, comprising one of the lowest percentages of women among medical specialties. Suggested reasons for this include a challenging work-life balance, lack of female role models and concerns regarding exposure to ionising radiation. Young female doctors considering a career in interventional radiology should be cognizant of the radiation risks, particularly related to pregnancy. Lack of knowledge or misinformation provided by the medical community often leads to undue apprehension and may deter potential trainees. Although there is no absolutely 'safe' threshold dose of radiation and it is known that the developing foetus is highly sensitive to radiation, particularly during the first trimester, the scale of exposure from medical imaging is in orders of magnitude below known thresholds for individual or foetal injuries. The risks of radiation need to be considered in this context. The average annual background radiation dose in most countries is 2-3mSv. Once a pregnancy has been declared, ICRP recommends that the additional dose to the foetus should not exceed 1mSv during the remainder of the pregnancy. The threshold dose for foetal injury is 100mSv. The average dose received by a working pregnant interventionist over the entire gestation is 0.3mSv and to the foetus is approximately 0.09mSv. The risks from occupational radiation exposure during pregnancy are very small indeed compared with other risks that may affect a pregnancy, i.e. a spontaneous abortion rate of 15% and an incidence of major malformation of 2%-4%. Pregnancy outcomes after exposure to radiation levels encountered in the angiography suite are indistinguishable from outcomes among the unexposed population (those exposed to natural background radiation). Once a medical radiation worker has declared a pregnancy, there are three options that are often considered. First, there may be no change in working duties. Second, work may be changed to another area with a lower radiation exposure, and third, it may be changed to an area with no radiation exposure. The latter is often requested because despite knowing that the risks are small, the pregnant worker does not wish to accept any risk. This may be logistically difficult if other employees are needed to fill the vacated position. If a pregnant interventionist continues working, it is important to keep the dose to a minimum by wearing appropriate personal protective shielding and practising careful fluoroscopic techniques. The simple answer to the posed question is that there is no real radiation hazard for young female doctors entering interventional radiology.",

A child should not be considered a 'small adult' but a standalone entity by means of procedure safety in general and radiation safety in particular. Children are more sensitive to radiation than adults. Radiological procedures carry higher risk per unit of radiation dose on an average for the development of cancer in infants and children compared with that in adults owing to known reasons such as longer life expectancy in children and that developing organs and tissues are more sensitive to the harmful effects of radiation. Clearly, the average risk is higher in infants and young children compared with older children. Interventional procedures in children should be absolutely justified, and radiation exposure in young children must be lower than that in adults. Good and well-controlled sedation or general anesthesia should be a routine for pain and anxiety and as a consequence dose management. A well-controlled relaxed child requires a lesser fluoroscopic intervention and less retakes during DSA runs. Exposure parameters on X-ray machines are often not adjusted for paediatric patients, and there is a clear need for appropriate selection of technical parameters such as focal spot size, pulse width, pulse rate, field size, air-gap magnification, filter thickness and position and anti-scatter grid systems. IR has to limit fluoroscopy time and the number of images obtained in angiographic and radiographic acquisitions, appropriate use of last image hold and storage of dynamic fluoroscopy, flexible automated detection systems, radiation-free patient positioning and collimation and post-processing magnification. No correlation is found between fluoroscopy time and measured entrance dose, but a strong correlation is observed between cumulative skin dose and patient weight. Diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) have a high importance in paediatric population. For interventional procedures, complexity of the procedure may be considered in setting DRLs. Data from all interventional procedures performed (not just from a limited sample) should be collated to derive local and national DRLs. This requires adjustment for the varying sizes of children.",

            "text": "In general, medical staff should never be exposed to the primary X-ray beam during interventional procedures. However, Compton scattered radiation from the patient can be significant. Personal protection strategies to reduce such exposure rely on three basic principles: time, distance, and shielding. Dose-reduction equipment include fixed barriers or shields close to the source of scatter (the patient) as well as personal protective equipment worn by interventional radiologists and technicians. Radiation at energies that are observed in fluoroscopy-guided interventions primarily interact through the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric attenuation coefficient depends on the atomic number (Z) of the absorbing material, which is why protective garments traditionally use lead (Pb, Z > 80) as the material usually in thicknesses of 0.25, 0.35, or 0.5 mm. The main disadvantage of Pb as the attenuation material is its C RSE heavy weight, which can cause discomfort, especially during long and repeated procedures. Various manufacturers provide garments made of alternative light-weight absorbers, sometimes in combination with Pb. The attenuation characteristics of such Pb composites or non-Pb protective garments are expressed in terms of Pb equivalence, assuming that they will attenuate the same as Pb. A 0.25-mm Pb-equivalent garment should attenuate about 97% of the X-Ray at 70 KVp. With an increasing KVp, the protective value of the shielding material declines; at 100 KVp, the attenuation will only be about 90%. Recent studies show a substantial variability in the protective value among Pb-equivalent aprons. A verification of the effectiveness of protective garments at a broad beam geometry needs to be warranted. In this lecture, various types of personal protection and their appropriateness for dose reduction will be explained and discussed. To learn how to evaluate current results reported in the literature For knee osteoarthritis (OA), several conservative treatments are recommended by clinical guidelines. The non-pharmacological therapies include patient education and self-management, exercises, weight reduction, walking supports (crutches), bracing, shoe and insoles modification, local cooling/heating, acupuncture, and electromagnetic therapy. Self-management, education and provision of information on OA, and treatment are widely promulgated as core recommendations for treating hip and knee OA in recent guidelines from National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons as well as in the OARSI guidelines and in many previously published guidelines. Pharmacological therapies mainly include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and slow-acting drugs (glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate). When orally administered drugs are ineffective in reducing sintomathology, intra-articular (IA) injection [corticosteroids (CSs), viscosupplements, and blood-derived products] is the non-operative modality that can be preferred. The major contraindication for IA injections is septic arthritis because in the presence of overlying soft-tissue infection, there is risk of iatrogenic spread to the joint. The ideal conservative management of knee OA requires a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities customized to individual patient needs; the goals of conservative therapy are to reduce pain, improve function and quality of life, and reduce disease evolution. Patient characteristics, symptoms, and clinical findings may indicate a practical approach for IA injections. CSs are generally indicated for acute and persistent synovitis in patients who cannot be operated; in addition, when the correlation of chondrolysis with OA flare is considered, the IA injection of CS for the short-term treatment of disease flares is recommended. Hyaluronic acid (HA) can be indicated for obese patients who are older than 60 years and for patients with extremity disease. The American College of Rheumatology subcommittee on OA has no recommendations regarding the use of IA hyaluronates. However, The American Society of Orthopedic Surgeons does not recommend using IA HA for patients with symptomatic knee OA. Work group of the American Society of Orthopedic Surgeons has interpreted that the quality of the supporting evidence is high, and their recommendation against the use of IA HA is strong in their guideline. The supposed long-term effect of HA is attractive for such patients who are not willing to be operated. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is generally used for patients younger than 60 years, with mild OA and body mass index < 30, and for patients that do not have any extremity malalignment. If the patients are older than 60 years, their body mass index is >30, or they have moderate OA, an application of PRP is indicated, followed by a supplementary single dose of HA injection 2-4 weeks after PRP injection. Five injectable CSs have a current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for IA injections: methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetate, betamethasone acetate and betamethasone sodium phosphate, triamcinolone hexacetonide, and dexamethasone. A few trials comparing functional outcomes after different IA CS injections have been published. However, the results are inconclusive. Although further research is needed, it seems that any agent provided with correct indication, dosage, timing, and application has similar potency. CSs have both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect, but their mechanism of action is complex. FDA-approved injectable hyaluronan products are sodium hyaluronate, hylan G-F 20, and high-molecular weight hyaluronan. HA is a glycosaminoglycan and a component of SF and cartilage matrix. Synovial cells, fibroblasts, and chondrocytes synthesize HA and secrete it into the joint. HA enhances the viscosity and elastic nature of SF. SF with normal HA concentration acts as a viscous lubricant during slow joint movements and as an elastic shock absorber during rapid joint movements. In the osteoarthritic joint, synovial inflammation leads to increased permeability of the synovial membrane for HA. In addition, the elevated levels of free radicals, inflammatory cytokines, and proteolytic enzymes in the SF of osteoarthritic knees impair HA function and contribute to OA progression. Therefore, in OA, both the molecular weight and the HA concentration decrease. The IA injection of HA is thought to restore normal viscoelastic properties of the pathologically altered SF, which explains the term of the approach: \"viscosupplementation.\" PRP is prepared from autologous blood by centrifugation to obtain a highly concentrated sample of platelets, which is four to five times higher than that of normal blood. The platelet concentrate is activated by adding calcium chloride, which results in the formation of platelet gel and the release of growth factors and bioactive molecules. Consequently, platelets actively participate in healing processes by delivering a broad spectrum of GFs and other factors that together contribute to comprehensive roles of PRP, including those in chondrogenesis, bone remodeling, proliferation, angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, coagulation, and cell differentiation. If the patients are older than 60 years, their body mass index is >30, or they have moderate OA, an application of PRP is indicated, followed by a supplementary single dose of HA injection 2-4 weeks after PRP injection. Salem et al in 2014 conducted a study on 20 adult rats, which were inducted of cartilaginous defect in both knee joints. During the second time, they injected a mesenchymal stem cell culture suspended in HA solution in the right knee of each rat, whereas the left knee served as a control. After 6 weeks, they showed that in 73% of the rats, the tissue was typical of fibrohyaline cartilage and appeared more cellular than fibrous. In 27% of the rats, the repaired tissue appeared more fibrous than hyaline. In the control knees, the newly formed tissue was an undifferentiated connective tissue and the cells were covered with a thin layer of fibrous tissue. This shows how promising the use of mesenchymal stem cells for autologous cartilage repair is, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Six major portals of approach to the knee joint for injection have been described: the lateral mid-patellar (LMP), medial mid-patellar (MMP), and patellofemoral; the superolateral and superomedial; and the anterolateral and anteromedial (inferolateral and inferomedial) approaches. The traditional approach to knee injection accesses the patellofemoral joint. This technique is performed with the knee in extension; the patella is pulled medially or laterally, and a needle is advanced under the patella. The LMP approach is the most commonly used. Via the LMP and MMP approaches the patellofemoral joint can then be used for joint aspiration and/or injection. When performing a procedure via the LMP approach, the needle is directed at a 45\u00b0 angle toward the middle of the medial aspect of the joint. Injection via the MMP approach is performed with the needle entering the medial aspect of the knee joint under the middle of the patella and is directed toward the lateral patellar mid-pole 3). Although the usual site of entry to the knee joint is via an LMP approach or an MMP approach, an approach lateral and superior to the patella can be used, especially if there is a large effusion in the suprapatellar bursa 14). This technique is performed with the patient in supine position and the knee extended. This technique aims for the suprapatellar pouch and allows the needle to pass underneath the articular surface of the patella. The anterior (or infrapatellar) approaches are an alternative to the classic patellofemoral approaches and are less often used for knee joint injection and aspiration. The inaccurate placement of injecting needles can result in damage to IA structures secondary to soft tissue infiltration by CS. Clinical experience has shown that the IA injection of the knee joint is more painful when the tip of the needle is in Hoffa's fat pad. This is also the most common ectopic injection site for missed IA injection. Chavez-Chang et al. have suggested that the length of the needle used for IA injection influences the accuracy of IA injection as the standard 3.8cm needle may be too short to reach the synovial space overlying the medial femoral condyle. A review by Berkoff et al. has shown that the accuracy of IA injection may be improved using ultrasound guidance, with an accuracy of 95.8% (versus 77.8% using anatomical guidance). Park et al. have reported an accuracy ranging from 95% (medial midpatellar approach) to 100% (superolateral approach) using ultrasound guidance with a long-axis in-plane technique. Maricar et al. 30) have stated that injection under ultrasound guidance may improve the likelihood of response to IA CS injection, and Sibbitt et al. have reported that ultrasound-guided aspiration and injection of the knee results in improved aspiration success, greater synovial fluid yield, more complete joint decompression, and improved clinical outcomes.",

            "text": "Based on randomized controlled trials in OA patients, it is proven that IA CSs are effective, but their benefit over placebo may be relatively short-lived up to 4 weeks. In a Cochrane review, the short-term efficacy of CSs in knee OA has been confirmed, and recently, the short-term effect has been shown in a systematic review by Hepper et al and in a meta-analysis by Bannuru et al. The efficacy of HA is a matter of debate, with markedly discordant interpretations of the data. Among the published meta-analyses, two have concluded an overall beneficial effect for HA injections, four have reported a small benefit, and two have found no evidence to support HA injection therapy for knee OA. Rutjes et al have found no important overall benefit on pain intensity or the frequency of OA flares in 89 trials involving 12667 patients. Bannuru et al have reported that HA asserts modest positive effect up to 24 weeks in certain clinical situations, but its cost-effectiveness is advised to be re-evaluated. In conclusion, studies have indicated that PRP is promising for relieving pain and improving knee function and quality of life. However, no data indicate that PRP cause osteophytes to regress or cartilage and meniscus to regenerate in patients with substantial and irreversible bone and cartilage damage. More promising results have been shown in younger patients and in patients with mild OA. The clinical use of PRP in OA is not supported by high-quality evidence on a real clinical improvement 6). However, its low cost, simple preparation technique, safety, and biologically active content have led to high acceptance by both patients and physicians. In the Cochrane reviews of trials comparing IA HA injections with IA CSs, no significant differences were observed 4 weeks after injection, but IA HA was more effective 5-13 weeks post injection. This is further supported by a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials involving patients with knee OA in which IA HA was compared directly with IA CS. In the first 2 weeks, CSs were more effective in relieving pain, but at 4 weeks, both CSs and HA were equally effective, and from 8 weeks to the last assessment during 26 weeks, HA was more effective. The analyses of the results for other outcomes, such as reduction in stiffness and improvement in function following IA HA, were similar. In a recent study, Kon et al evaluated PRP versus HA injections in 150 patients and found that PRP injections provided better results than HA injections in terms of reducing pain and symptoms and recovering articular function up to 6 months. In this study, PRP showed a better performance than HA in younger patients affected by cartilage lesions or early OA. However, PRP and HA treatments offered similar results in patient aged over 50 years and in advanced OA. In addition, Spakova et al compared 120 patients receiving IA injection of HA or PRP and reported significantly better scores after 3 and 6 months of followup in the group of patients who received PRP injections. Say et al compared IA HA and PRP injections in their prospective study and concluded that the application of a single PRP dose to be a safe, effective, and low-cost method for treating OA. Lastly, in very recent three level 1 studies, two randomized HA controlled clinical trials and one placebo-controlled trial, PRP decreased pain and improved function better than HA or placebo. ",

            "text": "Learning Objectives 1. To learn how to select patients for neurolysis in the knee 2. To learn how to evaluate current results reported in the literature 3. To learn how to use tips and tricks for successful neurolysis Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative (\"wear and tear\") type of arthritis; the prevalence of this type of arthritis increases with age. When the knee joint is involved, osteoarthritis ranks as the 11 th leading cause of years lived with disability and as the 3 rd greatest contributor to loss of health-related quality of life. The list of risk factors for knee osteoarthritis includes aging, obesity, and mechanical stress. The diagnosis and grading/staging of knee osteoarthritis is performed according to radiographic findings (using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale) or according to clinical symptoms and signs (as defined by the proposal of the American College of Rheumatology). Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include pain, stiffness, swelling, joint instability, reduced mobility, and muscle weakness. The therapeutic armamentarium includes physical and occupational therapy; weight loss; stretching exercises; analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs; intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, plasma-rich proteins, stem cells, or hyaluronic solution into the knee; extra-articular neurolysis of the genicular nerves; intra-articular application of pulsed radiofrequency (RF); and surgical options. Since the 70s, RF is used for chronic pain therapy in cases unresponsive to conservative treatment; neurolysis applies high temperatures (60\u00b0C-80\u00b0C) using continuous RF to destroy the target nerve while neuromodulation alters the transmission threshold without damaging the nerve itself. Currently, generators have the ability to simultaneously create multiple or quadrupolar RF lesions or to additionally work with the pulsed RF mode. During this latter case, the generator produces RF pulses each of which is followed by a silent phase, thereby keeping the temperature below 41\u00b0C. Compared with continuous RF, the pulsed mode has much less (if any) neurodestructive characteristics; the long silent phases (480 milliseconds) between the short bursts of application of energy (10-20 milliseconds) maintain the tissue temperature below 41\u00b0C and no nerve tissue damage occurs. Up until now, in vivo and in vitro studies support that there is no evidence of long-lasting structural effects caused by the application of pulsed RF. Histological studies focusing on the biological effects of the application of pulsed RF on the nerve tissue report architectural impairment of the axonal myelin sheath bundles, interstitial edema (which is temporary and persists for a few weeks post the session) as well as ultra-structural changes in the C and A delta nociceptive fibers. RF treatments in knee osteoarthritis aim for pain reduction; these kind of therapies for symptomatic patients suffering from pain due to knee osteoarthritis can be performed by extra-articular application of continuous RF at the level of the genicular nerves or by intraarticular application of pulsed RF. Pulsed RF applied inside the knee joint targets the pericapsular nerve endings responsible for pain; the technique suppresses the excitatory C fiber response and the synaptic transmission resulting in immediate pain relief. Additionally, with the application of pulsed RF inside the knee joint, an immune response is created interrupting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1b and interleukin-6. Comparative studies between continuous application of RF at the genicular nerves and a placebo therapy report significantly lower pain scores in the RF group during follow-up. On the other hand, studies on intra-articular application of pulsed RF (using a blind technique) report significant decrease in pain (>50%) over a 6-month follow-up. A pioneer study by Masala et al concludes that post intraarticular application of pulsed RF, significant decrease in pain and improved autonomy in daily life lasts for more than 12 months. In everyday clinical practice it is noted that toward 12 months post the therapeutic session, there is a tendency for increase in pain although the self-reported pain scores are significantly lower than those at the baseline. At this time point, a new therapeutic session could provide further symptom improvement. Application of RF (continuous at the level of the genicular nerves or intra-articular pulsed RF) does not cause regression of osteophytes or regeneration of cartilage and meniscus in patients with substantial bone and cartilage damage and therefore, addition of hyaluronate solution inside the joint seems to be necessary. Percutaneous application of RF energy either for neurolysis or for neuromodulation seems to be an effective and safe technique for palliative management of chronic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The results seem to be reproducible and last longer than those after intra-articular injection of hyaluronate only. There seems to be a need of repeating the session at 1 year. Further evaluation of the technique against a sham trial and/or an intra-articular injection of hyalouronate \u00b1 corticosteroids is warranted.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives 1. To learn how to select patients for embolisation in the knee 2. To learn how to evaluate current results reported in the literature 3. To learn how to use tips and tricks for successful embolisation The hallmark symptom of osteoarthritis (OA) is pain. This is the symptom that drives individuals to seek medical attention and contributes to functional limitation and reduced quality of life (1, 2) ; the alleviation of pain is the main motivation for treatment that includes non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical approaches. Severe and end-stage knee OA is successfully treated with joint replacement surgery, but effective management of mild-to-moderate radiographic knee OA that is refractory to conservative treatment can be difficult. Arthroscopic lavage and debridement have been performed for mild-to-moderate knee OA but their effectiveness has not been proven in a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (3). Although OA has been viewed as a 'wear and tear' disease for many decades, it is generally accepted to be a low-grade inflammatory disease of the synovial joints and a biomechanical whole-organ disease (4, 5) . Of specific interest is the role of neovasculature in supporting the osteoarthritic inflammatory process and catalysing the proliferation of perivascular sensory nerves. Blood vessel penetration across the osteochondral junction may impair the integrity of the cartilage-subchondral bone barrier and can stimulate osteophyte formation (6) . Angiogenesis-driven growth of sensory nerve fibres and the innervation of the normally anerual cartilage could be a major source of pain in OA (7) . The growth of vascular and neural networks is interdependent on myriad chemokines and other cell signalling molecules (vascular endothelial growth factor, semaphorins, etc.) (8, 9) . We have previously reported on the mid-term clinical outcomes and MRI changes after transcatheter arterial embolisation in 95 knees of 72 patients with mild-to-moderate radiographic knee OA (10) . Our study demonstrates that arterial embolisation improves pain symptoms and knee function up to the 4-year follow-up. No serious adverse event was noted. Minor complications such as moderate subcutaneous haemorrhage at the puncture site and transient cutaneous colour change on the treated knee occurred; all of which resolved without treatment. This study primarily used a non-permanent embolic material imipenem/silastatin sodium (n=88 knees). Embozene spheres (75 \u03bcm) were used for patients who had contraindications to imipenem (n=7 knees). There was no significant difference in clinical success between these two groups. MRI evaluation at 2 years after TAE showed a significant improvement in synovitis, a slight progression in osteophytes and no osteonecrosis or other evidence of ischaemic complications. In this study, abnormal neovessels were observed on angiography in all patients; these vessels were mainly located within the periarticular soft tissue (synovium, infrapatellar fat pad, periosteum and joint capsule) and were often observed to be in a location consistent with the sites of tenderness, suggesting that the prevalence of vascular changes in mild-to-moderate radiographic knee OA is quite high and that OA pain and local tenderness could be related to abnormal neoangiogenesis. MRI evaluation at the 2-year follow-up showed improvement in the synovitis score, which bolsters the hypothesis that abnormal neoangiogenesis is an important factor in inflammation (and thus pain) and that arterial embolisation can reduce inflammation by occluding these abnormal vessels. In this study, patients who had more severe degenerative changes (KL 3) showed a lower frequency of clinical success at 6 months after TAE than those with mild changes . A subset of patients in both groups experienced pain recurrence after initial clinical success. Knee OA is an age-related disease with no prospect for spontaneous recovery; it is thus expected that structural changes and associated inflammation will continue to progress and that pain can recur, particularly in patients with severe degenerative changes. Thus, although TAE cannot treat knee OA completely or reverse its natural progression, it seems to be an effective additional option to alleviate pain, decrease the use of pharmacologic painkillers and injection therapies and improve the quality of life. In the present case series, TAE allowed a reduction in the use of oral NSAIDs and oral opioids and a reduction in the frequency of use of injection therapies. There may be several concerns regarding knee OA embolisation, such as the risk of ischaemic events including osteonecrosis, muscle atrophy, peripheral paresthesia or neuropathic joint disease, such as Charcot joint. Although all patients in the present study were repeatedly asked and encouraged to report symptoms suggestive of these pathologies, none reported any such symptoms. On the MRI evaluation at 2 years after the first TAE, no ischaemic findings consistent with osteonecrosis or peri-articular soft tissue abnormalities were detected. The absence of such adverse events may be related to the embolic technique used in our study, particularly the use of small amounts of embolic material. Our session is designed to focus on patient selection for knee OA embolisation, evaluation of the results and how to use tips and tricks for successful embolisation.",

            "text": "How to overcome SFA lesions: toolbox proposal T. Rand Dept. of Radiology, KH Hietzing, Vienna, Austria Learning Objectives 1. To learn about strategies to overcome SFA lesions 2. To learn the current role of strategies to overcome SFA lesions 3. To learn outcomes following strategies to overcome SFA lesions Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is probably the most common condition treated using vascular intervention owing to intermittent claudication (IC). Occlusions and stenoses may be isolated or diffuse and may cause IC, which is observed more frequently at single locations in SFA, or critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is observed more frequently when SFA lesions are combined with lesions involving below-the-knee (BTK) arteries. Percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) with or without stenting has become a state-of-the-art treatment for SFA lesions. Generally, the main principle is to pass the lesion and introduce a guidewire in a safe position after having crossed the lesion. Then, PTA and/or stent applications are performed using a variety of specific techniques to treat the lesion and re-establish adequate antegrade blood flow. Therefore, the first step is to pass the lesion as safely and quickly as possible and place the guidewire after having passed the obstructed or stenotic lesion. A clear anatomic overview is mandatory and should be available prior to the procedure, usually using CT or MR angiography. Antegrade access is suggested to reduce distances to a minimum. Retrograde access using a long crossover sheath might be indicated when iliac lesions must be treated coincidentally. Generally, procedures should be performed as atraumatically as possible; therefore, low-profile devices should be used. For this purpose, sheath profiles should be as small as possible but as large as necessary to avoid unnecessary maneuvers. For passing the lesions, generally, hydrophilic guidewires are used intraluminally as the firstline approach. However, in obstructed and heavily calcified lesions, subintimal techniques, such as those primarily described by Bolia, are nowadays widely used. After having passed the lesion subintimally, re-entry into the true lumen of the vessel is mandatory. If such a re-entry cannot be performed by general guidewire techniques, dedicated tools, i.e., the so-called re-entry devices can be used to gain access to the true vessel lumen again. If antegrade techniques are insufficient, a retrograde access can be acquired by puncture of popliteal or pedal arteries. Dedicated lowprofile puncture sets are available to provide a quick and safe access. Once having passed the lesions, clear strategies must further be considered to treat the lesion as sufficiently as possible. Generally, the first-line approach is PTA with optional stenting. However, in heavily calcified lesions, primary stenting may be an option. Further, a decision must be taken right away if drug eluting balloons (DEB) need to be used. Given the indication for DEBs, they should be applied as the first-line approach. Similar considerations must be taken into account for the use of other first-line devices or tools, such as \"cutting balloons.\" Regarding stent techniques, general strategies should be defined for the use of drug-eluting stents (DES). Further, special strategies must be considered when treating lesions at highly flexible anatomic locations, such as the femoropopliteal segment. Dedicated stents and DEBs should be used for the treatment of this highly stressed segment.",

            "text": "Regarding potential complications, the interventional tool box must also contain devices and medication for embolectomy and lysis and dedicated stentgrafts in case of rupture or hemorrhage. Last but not the least, strategies regarding the use of closure devices must be established and considered for punctures of 5 F and more and outpatient management. Generally, tool boxes must cover all varieties of techniques and all devices that are potentially included within the general therapeutic strategy of each individual IR unit. They include tools for various puncture techniques and adequate guidewires for use in simple antegrade techniques, subintimal techniques, and total occlusions. Balloons and stents of various sizes and profiles with or without drug-eluting properties must be available in addition to tools for complication management and closure devices. In conclusion, strategic thinking starts with a clear planning of the procedure on the basis of preintervenional diagnostic evaluations. Antegrade access is the easiest and fastest basis for endovascular treatment of SFA lesions; however, crossover or even retrograde access must be considered if necessary. Access profiles should be as low as possible but as high as necessary. Wire size, surface qualities, and profiles must be considered. Clear technical and procedural strategies should be defined for the treatment itself. Decisions must be taken on primary stenting versus PTA and optional stenting. Further, the decision regarding using DEBs or DES must be pre-established. Special attention and strategies are necessary for the treatment of the highly flexible femoropoliteal segment. Re-entry devices should be included in every interventional tool box. Strategic thinking is a key point in any endovascular therapy, particularly, for SFA treatment. Due to the huge variety of techniques and devices and the complexity of procedures, all steps must be clearly defined and each maneuver demands its specific set-up. Tool boxes will be arranged individually in each IR Unit and established on the basis of each strategic decision. In such a set-up, outcomes and efficacy of the endovascular treatment of SFA lesions will be optimized. Strategic planning of SFA interventions plays a major role in every interventional center because it is the most frequent procedure used and its standardization will help establish a high procedural success, minimum complications, and fast and safe procedures. Clear strategies are essential to maximize outcomes, quality control, and patient safety. To learn the current role of drug-eluting balloons in the SFA 3. To learn outcomes following DCBs in the SFA including follow-up Drug-eluting technologies have been introduced in various endovascular treatment strategies for peripheral arterial occlusive disease since the early 2000s. With plain old balloon angioplasty offering only the option of dilating the target lesion and not addressing the desired recovery of the endothelial layer and the problem of neointimal hyperplasia, drug-eluting balloon angioplasty sounds tempting. In general, drug-eluting balloon angioplasty is considered to be an attractive alternative among plain old balloon angioplasty, baremetal stents, covered stents, and drug-eluting stents because the antiproliferative drug is administered in the critical phase of neointimal hyperplasia while not leaving behind any kind of stent as a permanent implant. As balloon dilation of any kind and stent placement provoke trauma in the endothelial layer, the recovery of this inner single-cell layer is crucial for short-and long-term patency of the target lesion. An intact and functional endothelial layer acts as an anticoagulant surface and prevents smooth muscle cell growth and thus, neointimal hyperplasia. By dilating and coating the inner vessel wall at atherosclerotic lesions with cytostatic or immunosuppressive agents, cellular mechanisms causing atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia are blocked and undesirable events in the followup may be prevented. Drugs to be delivered endovascularily into the vessel wall during drug-eluting balloon angioplasty may offer both the support of recovery of the endothelial layer and the prevention of neointimal hyperplasia. The most frequently used drugs in drugeluting balloon technology are paclitaxel and its derivatives as cytostatic drugs and sirolimus and its derivatives as immunosuppressive drugs. Since its introduction in endovascular treatment of arterial occlusive disease, there is an ongoing debate on the drug, type of coating, and released dose. Multiple randomized controlled trials have been conducted enrolling patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease with intermittent claudication and/or critical limb ischemia. Objectives of treating intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia are very different. The main focus for patients with intermittent claudication is to restore walking capacity and to improve the quality of life, whereas patients with critical limb ischemia are treated to relieve ischemic rest pain, to establish wound healing, and to prevent amputation. With respect to the methodological quality of specific trials, a variety of anatomic and clinical objectives are assessed. For anatomic issues such as patency rate, stenosis grade, binary restenosis, target lesion revascularization, and late lumen loss are examined. For clinical issues such as walking capacity, quality of life, change in Rutherford classification, anklebrachial-index, amputation, death, major adverse cardiac events, and event-free survival are examined. By including the abovementioned patients with intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia in the respective trials, heterogeneity and decrease in the quality of evidence of the outcomes and conclusions may be caused in terms of the anatomic and clinical objectives. Most of the randomized controlled trials provide follow-up data for 12 months, few for up to 2 years, and one for 5 years. In meta-analyses, drug-eluting balloon angioplasty shows better results for primary patency rates for up to 2 years, with odds ratio of 1.47 at 6 months, 1.92 at 1 year, and 3.51 at 2 years and for late lumen loss, with a mean difference of \u22120.64 mm at 6 months and \u22120.80 mm at 2 years. Drug-eluting balloon angioplasty also performed better than plain old balloon angioplasty for target lesion revascularization, with odds ratio of 0.40 at 1 year, 0.28 at 2 years, and 0.21 at 5 years, and for binary restenosis rate, with odds ratio of 0.38 at 1 year, 0.26 at 2 years, and 0.12 at 5 years. No statistic differences were found for amputation, death, change in Rutherford classification, quality of life, or walking capacity. Thus, there is evidence in literature that compared with plain old balloon angioplasty, drug-eluting balloon angioplasty is of advantage in terms of anatomic objectives, such as primary patency rate, binary restenosis rate, target lesion revascularization, and late lumen loss. In contrast, there is no evidence in literature that drugeluting balloon angioplasty is superior in terms of clinical objectives, such as amputation, death, change in Rutherford classification, quality of life, or walking capacity. Taking into account these controversial results for statistical significance of anatomic and clinical endpoints, drug-eluting balloon angioplasty does not provide better clinical outcome than plain old balloon angioplasty. Moreover, additional costs for this elaborate technology must be considered, particularly when proposed to the patient as the clinical efficacy has not been proven yet. To learn the current role of DES and BMS in the SFA 3. To learn outcomes following DES and BMS in the SFA including follow-up Endovascular treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease has become the primary revascularization method in most centers.1,2 However, the optimal endovascular modality for femoropopliteal artery disease has not been determined yet. Standard endovascular treatment options include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and routine stent placement. Placement of bare-metal stents (BES) and drug-eluting stents (DES) have emerged as a more durable alternative by providing permanent scaffolding to prevent recoil and increase patency rates, particularly in longer lesions. However, BES are still associated with a considerable rate of restenosis and repeat revascularization. DES use antiproliferative drugs to reduce neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis. DES are associated with lower rates of restenosis, but the evidence is moderate. DES are also attributed with chronic inflammation and incomplete re-endothelialization. They also bring about neoatherosclerotic changes. At present, only limited long-term data are available. To learn tricks and tips to increase the yield of angiography for GI-haemorrhage 3. To learn strategies how to deal with negative angiography results Interventional treatment of gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a standard technique commonly used in acute situations. Usually, angiography is performed after bleeding is detected either on a CT scan or by other techniques such as RBC scans. Even though a bleeding has already been observed non-invasively, it can be challenging to visualise it during angiography. This may be due to many different circumstances such as patient condition, unclear location of the bleeding vessel, challenging collateralisation or poor image quality. Thus, careful evaluation of the patient prior to the intervention is necessary, and knowledge of basic anatomy as well as advanced anatomy, including collateral supply, is important. Especially, anatomical variants should be known to be able to inject CM in all potentially bleeding vessels. For optimal visualisation, number of images acquired per second should carefully be chosen and increased if necessary. Injection should be performed in non-subtracted and subtracted images in order to avoid misregistration. Potentially provocative angiography may be able to help, e.g. using vasodilators. In certain cases, empirical embolisation may also be an option and should be carefully considered together with the referring physician. To learn about the advantages and disadvantages of different embolic agents when embolising GI-haemorrhage 3. To learn which complications can occur using the various embolic agents and how to prevent these Embolisation is currently proposed as the first step in the treatment of acute, life-threatening GI bleeding when endoscopic approach is not possible or is unsuccessful. Like in most procedures performed in emergency settings, time represents a significant factor influencing outcomes. Modern tools permit identifying and reaching the bleeding site faster than two-dimensional angiography. The second fundamental aspect regards the embolisation technique. Embolisation may be performed with gelatin sponges, particles, coils and microcoils and more recently, with glue. There are no guidelines for the choice of embolic materials used, and the final decision is usually made by the operator on the basis of his experience and compliance. There are two main concerns with GI bleeding embolisation: rebleeding and the risk of secondary bowel ischaemia. The goal is to embolise selectively at the level of the vasa recta, avoiding the marginal artery. The particles are associated with an increased risk of bowel infarction because they cannot be visualised or precisely deposited and may reflux into non-target arteries. Cyanoacrylates are very effective in terms of bleeding control and rebleeding but are not controllable and require high operator expertise otherwise their use is associated with a high risk of non-targeted embolisation and severe intestinal ischaemia. For this purpose, in most centres, detachable coils were introduced, and they seem to be safe even if incomplete embolisation is reported in literature. No data are available for selective embolisation of GI bleeding with microvascular plugs. Ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer is a liquid embolisation agent, which does not have adhesive properties for making contact with arterial walls but has properties of \"filling\" the vascular lumen. The major advantages of this liquid compared with glue are its controlled release, non-adherence, progressive solidification, cohesiveness, high vascular penetration and weak inflammatory effect on the endothelium. The remarkable advantage of acting independently of any underlying coagulopathy or low platelet count is another important characteristic. Early identification of the leaking vessel, fast reaching of the site of bleeding and use of an embolic agent that reduces risks of non-target embolisation and bowel ischaemia may be considered fundamental for fast and precise GI bleeding embolisation. In this field, nowadays, modern tools permit safer and more effective embolisation even if more data are necessary to affirm the exact technique for different situations.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives 1. To learn about predictors of success and failure when embolising GI-haemorrhage 2. To learn ways to improve the outcome of embolisation for GI-haemorrhage 3. To learn about optimal patient selection algorithms for embolisation of GI-haemorrhage The success (or failure) of arterial bleeding in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is determined by multiple factors, some of which can be influenced by interventional radiologists, adequate periprocedural care, or proper logistics. The presence of a single focal bleeding vessel or only a few bleeding vessels are predictors of success, whereas that of multiple bleeding vessels or diffuse bleeding lower the chances of a successful embolization. This may also be related to the underlying disease. The presence of an underlying tumor or inflammatory process (e.g., necrotizing pancreatitis) may lower the chance of a durable success of embolization as the process itself is not treated by the embolization procedure but only the hemorrhagic sequelae. Bleeding from angiodysplasia also has a high propensity for recurrence. The nature of the vascular territory is an important determinant of the chances of rebleeding after an initially successful embolization procedure. In general, upper GI bleeding has a higher chance of recurrence as compared with lower GI bleeding because the upper GI tract has a more abundant arterial supply and higher potential for collateral blood flow as compared with the lower GI tract. The coagulation status of the patient is also an important determinant of the outcome of embolization, and every effort should be made to optimize the coagulation profile immediately before or during the embolization procedure. Coagulation status is not only influenced by medications taken by patients but also by the depletion of coagulation factors during massive hemorrhage and can be further worsened by hypothermia and acidosis. It is vital to minimize time loss when there is massive bleeding, and studies have shown a strong correlation between the time interval from onset of severe bleeding and angiographic treatment after failure of conservative or endoscopic treatment. A history of many blood transfusions before referral to angiography has also been shown to predict a poor outcome, and this most likely also reflects poor logistics and time loss before referral to angiography in addition to depletion of coagulation factors. Knowledge of the abovementioned factors may aid in improving logistics and tailoring embolization procedures (e.g., by choosing the proper embolic agents based on the coagulation status of the patient). To learn how to evaluate randomised studies found in the literature 3. To learn how to use data to improve safety and efficacy Vertebroplasty has been one of the most controversial interventional radiology procedures over the last 10 years. The controversy was generated by two placebo-controlled trials on vertebroplasty published in 2009 showing no benefit of vertebroplasty over placebo. The clinical use of vertebroplasty reduced after these trials were published, although vertebral augmentation was still performed in significant numbers with 81,000 vertebral augmentation procedures (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty) performed in the USA in 2013 1 . Randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence of vertebroplasty can be separated into open-label trials and blinded (placebo-controlled) trials. Several, but not all, open RCTs 2 have shown better improvement in pain and function with vertebroplasty than with conservative care. At the time of writing this abstract, three blinded RCTs comparing vertebroplasty with a placebo have been published with different outcomes. Blinded trials are considered to have less risk of bias than open RCTs; therefore, the definitive evidence on vertebroplasty rests with placebo-controlled blinded trials. The first two blinded trials 3, 4 were published together in 2009. Both were multicentre trials enrolling outpatients with fractures for less than 12 months. Hospital inpatients were not included in either trial. The larger 2009 trial 3 aimed to enrol 250 patients but terminated enrolment with 131 patients (from multiple sites in 3 continents) after a 4-year enrolment period. Eligibility criteria were numeric rated scale (NRS) pain of >3/10, outpatient status and failure of conservative therapy (although enrolling patients with mild NRS pain suggests that some patients already had successful outcome from conservative therapy). The primary endpoint was mean population NRS pain and Roland-Morris Disability (RMDQ) score at 1 month following intervention. Following the primary outcome collection, patients were permitted to crossover at 1 month and 51% of the control group and 13% of the vertebroplasty group crossed over after 1 month, diluting the secondary data at follow-up beyond this. At 1 month, there was no significant difference in mean NRS pain or RMDQ scores between the placebo and vertebroplasty groups. The mean duration of fracture at enrolment was 23 weeks and the mean injected poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) volume was 2.6cc. The smaller of the 2009 blinded trials 4 enrolled outpatients from 4 centres in Melbourne, Australia. This trial targeted 200 patients but completed with 78 patients after a 4-year enrolment period. Eligibility criteria were back pain (although an entry NRS pain threshold level was not defined) and MRI evidence of recent vertebral fracture. Although not specifically excluded by protocol, hospital inpatients were not reported to be included. The primary endpoint was NRS pain at 3 months post-intervention and showed no difference in mean NRS pain between the vertebroplasty and placebo groups. The mean duration of fracture at enrolment was 12 weeks and mean injected PMMA volume was 2.8cc.",

            "text": "The third blinded trial is the VAPOUR trial 5 published in 2016. Authors of this trial had participated in the larger of the earlier blinded trials 3 , the INVES trial. We reconfigured the INVEST trial protocol to use a similar placebo-controlled, blinded trial methodology but enrolled patients with an acute, severe pain syndrome rather than patients with chronic back pain. Changes from the 2009 blinded trial protocols were as follows: 1. Elevating enrolment pain requirement to severe pain only (NRS pain \u2265 7/10). 2. Restricting fracture duration to <6 weeks. 3. Including hospital inpatients. 4. Excluding crossover. 5. Primary endpoint directly measured the nominated, desired clinical outcome from vertebroplasty, i.e., improvement to mild pain (NRS < 4/10) at 2 weeks post-intervention having enrolled with severe pain (NRS > 7/10). This replaced the mean population NRS pain score used in previous trials. The VAPOUR trial 5 achieved its target enrolment of 120 patients in 3 years from 4 centres. The mean fracture duration was 3 weeks. The mean PMMA volume per fracture was 7.5cc. Hospital inpatients comprised 57% of the patients compared with zero in previous blinded trials. The primary endpoint was positive with an increased proportion of patients with NRS pain of <4/10 at 2 weeks in the vertebroplasty group (44%) compared with those in the placebo group (21%). The between-group difference (23%) was significant (P=0.01). The between-group difference in favour of the vertebroplasty group persisted at similar levels at 1 month, 3 months and at the final data collection point of 6 months. There were also clinically important reductions in RMDQ disability scores, duration of hospital stay and height loss in the fractured vertebra at 6 months. The sum evidence from vertebroplasty RCTs does not indicate an increase in serious adverse events or incident fractures with vertebroplasty compared with those with conservative care. Considered together, the evidence from the three published blinded trials on vertebroplasty shows that vertebroplasty should be reserved for patients with acute, severe pain of <6 weeks due to osteoporotic fractures. The earlier blinded trials 3, 4 did not indicate the efficacy of vertebroplasty in outpatients with predominately non-acute (duration>6weeks) fractures and including patients with non-severe pain. On the other hand, the VAPOUR trial 5 demonstrated clinically important pain reduction after vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporotic fractures of <6/52 duration with severe pain. Hospitalised inpatients should be a central part of the vertebroplasty programme as they have very fresh fractures and severe pain and disability. Hospitalised inpatients were excluded in the earlier trials but comprised 57% of the VAPOUR trial 5 . Introduction Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is defined by a reduction in the height of the individual vertebral body by 20% or 4 mm and can be secondary to various pathological conditions, such as osteoporosis, trauma or neoplasms. The collapse of the vertebral body associated with VCF can lead to hyperkyphosis, a potential source of persistent spinal deformation. Whenever possible, correction of the kyphotic deformation is, therefore, indicated. Vertebral augmentation procedure (VAP) is a general term for several techniques used for treating VCFs. VAPs are minimally invasive interventions which aim to consolidate the fracture and try to achieve height restoration. VAPs can be divided into percutaneous vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty and implant techniques.",

The first percutaneous spinal injection of acrylic cement was performed in 1984 to treat a painful vertebral haemangioma of C2. Since then, the field of indications has enlarged and vertebroplasty is now a recognized treatment for osteoporotic, malignant and traumatic compression fractures of the spine. Although some authors report an increase in the vertebral body height after percutaneous vertebroplasty, this technique usually does not allow restoration of the vertebral body height in majority cases. Osteonecrosis represents an exception as stand-alone vertebroplasty can partially restore the vertebral height by filling the necrotic cavity. In such cases, it is important to properly install the patient on the operating table with the spine extended to maximize the correction of the vertebral body height. Percutaneous vertebroplasty also represents a valuable option for consolidation of the traumatic or osteoporotic fracture with minimal deformation (kyphotic angle < 15\u00b0).",

It was stated that the inflation of two balloons inside the vertebral body should restore the height of the fractured vertebra and thus could overcome one of the drawbacks of vertebroplasty. Many studies confirmed that kyphoplasty is superior to vertebroplasty for correction of the vertebral deformation and reduction of the rate of cement leakage. Kyphoplasty requires general anaesthesia to improve the restoration of the vertebral body height (complete patient relaxation). The best results were obtained for acute fractures (less than 7 days ideally). The inflammatory process of fracture healing in the spine starts a few hours after the trauma and lasts for 1 to a maximum of 2 weeks. An attempt to restore the vertebral height with vertebral augmentation devices in trauma patients should, therefore, be performed as early as possible before the repair phase starts. In trauma patients, kyphoplasty may be indicated for A1 fractures as per the classification of Magerl. Some incomplete burst fractures (A3.1) might also benefit from a kyphoplasty procedure, which represents a minimally invasive alternative to surgery for some selected cases. One major drawback of kyphoplasty is the loss of restored height after balloon deflation, which could limit the benefit of the technique in terms of correction of the vertebral deformation. To overcome such limitations, percutaneous implant techniques were developed.",

Different devices have been released on the market: vertebral body stents made of cobalt-chrome, expandable nitinol devices, jacks and PEEK implants.

            "text": "C RSE sacral fractures are insufficiency fractures related to osteoporosis. However, high-energy trauma can also result in sacral fractures with normal underlying bone density. Additionally, pathologic sacral fractures related to lytic osseous metastatic disease can be a source of severe pain and disability. Although a pathologic fracture is often associated with lytic tumors of the sacrum, there can be a significant amount of pain related to the tumor even in the absence of a fracture. Sacroplasty can be an effective treatment for osteoporotic insufficiency fractures by introducing poly (methyl methacrylate) cement through a needle directly into the fractured sacrum similar to traditional vertebroplasty. Combined treatments for pathologic tumor-related lesions can sometimes include initial endovascular tumor embolization and/or tumor ablation techniques prior to the introduction of cement into the sacrum. Although sacral fractures can be preceded by an identified fall or traumatic event, it is very common for patients to describe the onset of symptoms that are unrelated to any specific event. Furthermore, the symptoms of a sacral fracture can sometimes be insidious in onset and nonspecific in nature. Hip, buttock, groin, tailbone, perineal, and back pain have all been described by patients with a sacral fracture. Most patients will have significant difficulty in walking as this erect weight-bearing act places additional shear stress to the fractured sacrum. Although less common than pain and difficulty walking, some patients will also experience bowel or bladder dysfunction and decreased strength and sensory complaints in the lower extremities. Similar to patients with thoracic and lumbar vertebral compression fractures, pain and disability associated with a sacral fracture can lead to a downward spiral in overall health. Bedridden patients can develop bedsores, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, loss of muscle mass, further loss in bone density, and even death. Patients requiring long-term narcotic treatment for alleviation of pain may also experience cognitive decline and constipation associated with the narcotics. Sacral fractures often go undiagnosed or are diagnosed in a delayed fashion. Factors contributing to the delay in diagnosis include nonspecific and often nonlocalizing symptoms, lack of inclusion in the differential diagnosis, and challenges in imaging. Sacral insufficiency fracture is relatively new to the medical community and was first describe by Dr. Lourie in 1982. As the disease becomes more familiar to medical professionals, the timely diagnosis will inevitably improve as they begin to look for the fractures with tailored imaging techniques. Currently, patients with sacral fractures are often initially imaged with CT of the pelvis or MRI of the lumbar spine depending on the predominant symptoms. Careful attention to the imaging studies is necessary to make the correct diagnosis. CT imaging can be insensitive to the diagnosis of a sacral fracture, particularly in the absence of sclerotic healing and offset fracture margins in the osteoporotic bone. Attention to subtle cortical disruption at the periphery of the sacral ala or along the circular sacral neural foramina is mandatory, and edema in the presacral fat adjacent to the fracture may be the only sign in an acute sacral insufficiency fracture. On the contrary, the presence of a pathologic metastatic lesion should be readily apparent. With respect to MRI of the lumbar spine, the difficulty generally lies in the field of view parameters that include little, if any, of the sacrum in the axial sequences and often neglect the lateral sacral ala in the sagittal sequences. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the radiologist to specifically look at all portions of the sacrum visible on a routine lumbar spine MRI keeping the diagnosis of sacral fractures in mind as a cause of most generic symptoms that beget MRI of the lumbar spine. If there is a question of sacral fracture, bone scintigraphy with SPECT can be useful and is highly sensitive to the diagnosis. However, the relative lack of spatial resolution generally requires additional cross-sectional imaging to evaluate the relationship of the fracture(s) to the sacroiliac joints, neural foramina, and sacral spinal canal. If possible, MRI of the pelvis is an ideal study. It is just as sensitive as bone scintigraphy but also allows for high spatial resolution and the depiction of sacral foramina and common anatomic variations in the shape of the sacrum and sacroiliac joints. If the patient cannot undergo an MRI, CT can be useful in addition to scintigraphy. The use of cement in the treatment of pathologic sacral lesions and insufficiency fractures was first described between 2000 and 2002. Injecting cement through a needle into the abnormal sacral bone was a natural extension of the more common vertebroplasty techniques used in the thoracic and lumbar spine at that time. Since those initial case reports, there have been numerous case reports and case series describing the technique of sacroplasty and its clinical utility. Despite the similarities with traditional thoracolumbar vertebroplasty, sacroplasty is generally considered more challenging because of the variation and complexity of the sacral anatomy compared with thoracic and lumbar vertebrae anatomy. Naturally, any proceduralist wanting to learn sacroplasty should first be highly experienced in the traditional thoracolumbar vertebroplasty technique. Majority reports in the literature claim that pain relief and improvement in disability with sacroplasty is similar to those with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Furthermore, every proceduralist who performs sacroplasty on a routine basis will assert the undeniable benefit of the procedure for insufficiency fractures and pathologic lesions of the sacrum. However, a true randomized controlled trial has yet to be published comparing sacroplasty with standard medical therapy. Consequently, the same controversy that surrounds the effectiveness of vertebral augmentation in the thoracolumbar spine is undoubtedly present in any discussion on the use of cement in the sacrum. A well-planned multicenter randomized trial that focused on the use of sacroplasty for osteoporotic insufficiency fractures would be valuable in affirming the use of this procedure. As sacroplasty has slowly advanced as a recognized procedure for pain relief related to sacral lesions, multiple techniques for percutaneously depositing cement into the sacrum have been described. Fluoroscopy, CT, and a combination of both modalities have been described as safe and effective for treating sacral insufficiency fractures. The choice of image guidance is often based upon the resources available at an institution as well as the personal preference of the proceduralist. Each modality has benefits as well as limitations when compared with the other modality. Fluoroscopy allows for exaggerated camera angles to assist with precise needle placement, whereas the use of CT allows for more direct visualization of anatomic structures, such as the SI joints and foramina. Beyond the modality used for performing the procedure, nuances of needle placement and cement injection techniques also vary widely. Given the shape of the sacrum and the typical configuration of sacral fractures, percutaneous needle placement strategy should be tailored as per the individual sacral fracture. Multiple ipsilateral needles placed perpendicular to the long axis of the sacral ala have been described as the preferred technique for sacroplasty. However, others have demonstrated equivalent safety and success with a single needle advanced parallel to the long axis of the upper sacral ala and generally parallel to the vertical fracture component. While proponents of each technique tend to defend their method as superior, there is no convincing evidence that one technique is any safer or more successful than the other. As opposed to thoracolumbar vertebral cement augmentation, the widely varied techniques and modalities used to treat sacral insufficiency fractures will undoubtedly make the design of any randomized sacroplasty trial difficult. For pathologic lytic sacral masses, with or without associated fractures, the treatment techniques are even more diverse. If the lesion is potentially hypervascular, initial angiography and possible embolization can be useful prior to subsequent penetration and manipulation of the tumor. This is particularly true if the lesion is adjacent to critical structures that might be affected by iatrogenic bleeding. Ablation techniques to create a void within the tumor of a lytic sacral mass can also be a critical adjunct to successful sacroplasty. This allows for the controlled deposition of cement and limits the displacement of tumor cells into the circulation or into adjacent spaces, such as the sacral spinal canal or foramina. In summary, percutaneous sacroplasty has emerged as a promising procedure for treating sacral insufficiency fractures and pathologic lytic sacral lesions. There is an abundance of case series in the literature describing the successful outcomes and safety of the procedure and its utilization will likely increase over time, particularly as awareness of its availability permeates the medical community. Ideally, a well-designed randomized trial is desired to clarify the future expansion of sacroplasty. There are various techniques described in the literature for performing sacroplasty. While there is no consensus on the superiority of one technique over the others, proceduralists need to be comfortable with the anatomy of the sacrum and the imaging modality chosen for guidance if they expect to achieve success.",

To learn how the imaging is optimised in established highvolume stroke services In the last few years, several randomized controlled trials have shown effectiveness of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Guidelines have been rewritten worldwide to include this new treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an intracranial large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation which can be treated within 6 hours of symptom onset. Two important questions arise: 1. can we define patients who will not benefit from this treatment although they comply with the indications in current guidelines and 2: can we define patients who might benefit from endovascular treatment although they do not comply with the indications in these guidelines. Besides clinical indicators, imaging biomarkers might play a role in the selection strategy. Several (advanced) imaging options are available: ASPECTS, clot burden score, collateral scoring, venous filling, CT perfusion, and diffusion-weighted MRI. The different imaging options will be discussed and their value for selecting or deselecting patients potentially eligible for endovascular treatment after acute ischemic stroke will be evaluated based on available data in current literature. To learn how to reduce the time spent on the angiotable till obtaining the access; from sedation/anaesthesia to initial access before thrombectomy stage Recent randomised trials have demonstrated the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion, leading to guideline changes in many countries. Workflow analyses highlighted the impact of time on patients with acute ischaemic stroke undergoing endovascular therapy. Optimised workflow structures include early information and preparation of a multidisciplinary team consisting of different players, including the neurointerventionalist, neurologist and anaesthesiologist, for standardised patient selection. A short median time from admission to the neurointerventional centre to groin puncture in the cath lab and structured preinterventional protocols have proven the efficiency of this workflow in these incoming emergency patients. A door to groin puncture time of 90 minutes was achieved in the SWIFT PRIME trial compared with the guideline-recommended 120 minutes. The median time intervals achieved in key trials range from 113 minutes with EXTEND-IA trials to 109 minutes with the REVASCAT trial. An assessment of 643 patients in the Neurovascular Net Ruhr showed a median time from admission to groin puncture of 82 minutes in 300 patients primarily admitted and of only 34 minutes in 343 patients secondarily transferred. There are still options for improvement in reducing delays immediately before revascularisation. Keeping a 'thrombectomy tool box' (Flensburg stroke tool box) in the interventional suite can be implemented in daily practice as well as use of the CIRSE checklist immediately prior to the procedure itself. It has been suggested that neuroimaging (CT and CTA) could be performed in the angiography suite. However, this concept may lead to an inefficient use of angiography room resources. There has been a lot of debate on additional imaging beyond CT and CTA or MRI and MRA, such as CT perfusion or diffusion-and perfusionweighted MRI, for selecting patients. The benefits of time-consuming add-on imaging before endovascular therapy are still unknown (Guidelines American Stroke Association, Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Furthermore, the selection of anaesthetic techniques, such as local anaesthesia combined with sedation versus general anaesthesia, has various advantages and disadvantages, but the strategy employed should be fast. The MR CLEAN investigators have reported that the outcome for 137 endovascular patients who did not receive general anaesthesia had a better outcome than the 267 control patients who underwent conscious sedation. These data have been criticised because of a selection bias. Similar retrospective data were reported in a recent meta-analysis of 9 nonrandomised studies comprising 1956 patients (814 received general anaesthesia and 1142 received conscious sedation), with the largest study including 1079 patients and the smallest study including 66 patients. In SWIFT PRIME, hospitals using general anaesthesia for the procedure were as efficient as those using conscious sedation in all cases. According to the SIESTA trial, both general anaesthesia and conscious sedation were safe and feasible. The anaesthetic technique should be individualised on the basis of patient risk factors, clinical characteristics, tolerance to the procedure and experience of the neuro-interventionalist. Concepts for improved stroke management workflow algorithms will be presented. To learn how to optimise the revascularisation with the most recent tools In patients with large vessel occlusion, mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers in combination with intra-arterial lysis has become the standard of care since 2014 based on evidence from various randomized clinical trials. For stent retriever-based techniques, the use of a balloon-guiding catheter seems to be essential. The US STRATIS registry provided further evidence for the use of a balloon-guiding catheter with a significantly higher rate of good functional outcome after 90 days compared with that after the use of distal access catheters. Recently, aspiration techniques without the use of stent retrievers became popular. In 2015, the THERAPY Trial using the Penumbra System failed to show a significant therapeutic effect compared with i.v. tPA. The so called \"a direct first pass aspiration technique\" (ADAPT technique) is an aspiration technique using large-bore direct aspiration catheters without stent retrievers. This approach showed similar technical results compared with those after the use of a stent retriever in the recent French ASTER trial.",

To learn the imaging modality of choice in acute and subacute situations 3. To learn the use of optimal imaging protocols Modern multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is without doubt the most potent weapon in the diagnostic armamentarium for patients who have suffered significant trauma. It is clearly more sensitive and specific than even experienced clinical examination, plain films, or ultrasound examination in assessing such patients. It can define the need for surgical and/or interventional radiological treatment promptly. The patients who benefit the most from MDCT are in fact the most severely injured patients. The traditional teaching that such patients should immediately undergo surgery is, therefore, challenged by technological developments in MDCT and the clinical evidence. To complicate matters, focussed abdominal sonography in trauma (FAST scanning) performs very poorly in these situations and is arguably worse than experienced clinical assessment. Therefore, processes should be put in place to maximize the proportion of patients undergoing MDCT examination while taking individual hospital environments into account. There should be cogent reasons for bypassing MDCT and going straight to surgery. Rehearsal is important. An awareness of the time to achieve physiological correction is important; even if the start of the therapeutic procedure might be delayed by MDCT, its completion will not be delayed if relevant information is available promptly. In most severely injured patients, it is possible to estimate the time taken for completion of an interventional radiological procedure to achieve haemostasis, thereby allowing discussion with trauma surgeons. The exact protocol used for MDCT is probably less important than the processes that have been designed to perform and report the examination promptly and act on the findings. It is important that examinations are kept as simple and as fast as possible and this may be best achieved if the same type of protocol is always performed, even if time is not at a premium.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury Scale grades liver injury from I to VI and splenic and renal injuries from I to V, where the higher grade indicates more severe injury [8] . CT is highly accurate in detecting injuries (up to 98% for detecting splenic injuries) with an overall accuracy of 83% for detecting vascular injury [4] . Arterial extravasation detected by MDCT is between 13% and 17% for splenic injuries and approximately 9% for hepatic injuries [9, 10] . Signs of vascular injury in a solid organ in MDCT are active extravasation (contrast blush) in the arterial phase that does not wash out in the delayed phase, haematoma, haemoperitoneum in the appropriate clinical setting, pseudoaneurysm, A-V fistula, vessel cut-off (truncation) or significant irregularity of the vessels.",

However, during the last two decades, the paradigm of management for haemodynamically stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma has shifted from operative to non-operative management (NOM). Haemodynamic stability is defined as haemorrhagic shock not greater than class 2, i.e. normal BP, normal or elevated pulse rate, respiration rate < 30/min, normal or decreased pulse pressure and rapid response to initial fluid therapy of 2L crystalloid [11] . NOM is the standard of care for haemodynamically stable patients with blunt splenic and hepatic injury with success rates of 82%-100% for hepatic injury and failure rates of 8%-38% for splenic injury. Higher grades of injury had greater risk of haemorrhage and higher probability of failure of NOM. Besides, NOM should only be considered in a centre with capabilities for monitoring and serial clinical evaluation and a operation room available for urgent surgery C RSE [5, 6] . Most renal trauma is minor (80%) and managed conservatively in the absence of haemodynamic instability.

Complications of embolisation occur in up to 20% cases, including failure in controlling bleeding (11%-15%), missed injuries and abscess formation. Similarly, stable patients with hepatic injury AAST grade > III, presence of contrast blush, free intraperitoneal blood and evidence of hepatic venous injury are candidates for embolisation [5, 6] . Embolisation is highly efficacious for solid organ trauma demonstrating splenic salvage rates above 85% and success rates between 85% and 100% for severe hepatic injuries [7] . Renal vascular injury occurs in approximately 2.2% of all patients, and percutaneous embolisation is the therapeutic modality of choice for haemodynamically stable patients with success rate as high as 94% in patients undergoing embolisation as a primary management. Technical failure and repeat embolisation can occur in up to 9.5% cases and renal abscess can occur in up to 5% cases [4] . Embolisation has also a high success rate for penetrating truncal injuries with a success rate over 90% as a primary therapeutic modality, adjunct to surgery or as a first line management after failure of operative management [12, 13, 14] . Embolisation materials can be temporary (Gelfoam) or permanent (macro coils; micro coils; vascular plugs; liquid embolic agents, such as glue or Onyx; and particles). Most frequently used embolic agents are coils and Gelfoam. Covered stents can sometimes be used in larger and straighter vessel lesions. Most embolisation agents require an intact coagulation cascade and it is important to perform embolisation before severe coagulopathy sets in, particularly due to massive transfusion. Non-selective embolisation is indicated to expedite haemostats in cases of patient instability, massive bleeding or multiple sites of haemorrhage. Super-selective embolisation is otherwise preferred for preserving tissue and function [3] .",

Either macro coils (1-2mm upsized) or vascular plugs (approximately 30%-40% upsized) can be used for proximal embolisation. To avoid ischaemic pancreatitis, proximal embolisation should be performed between the dorsal pancreatic artery and arteria pancreatica magna or distal to both the arteries. Distal embolisation is recommended for focal parenchymal lesion/bleeding for which a microcatheter is coaxially introduced for super-selective placement and embolisation is performed with micro coils, Gelfoam or glue [16] .

However, because of the smaller calibre of vessels, it is not always possible to cross the site of injury to perform the sandwich technique. Distal embolisation with Gelfoam or particles followed by proximal embolisation with coils is an effective technique in this scenario. Embolisation of the common or proper hepatic artery by macro/micro coils can be performed and is tolerated because of dual blood supply and extensive collaterals in the liver.

            "text": "Learning Objectives 1. To learn the difference between solid organ and pelvic trauma patterns 2. To learn the approaches to pelvic trauma embolisation 3. To learn major complications of pelvic embolisation Approximately 1%-2% patients with pelvic ring fractures are hemodynamically unstable and one in 5 cases of unstability will be due to arterial bleeding (1) . The early management of hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fractures poses a significant challenge owing to competing clinical priorities. The reported mortality is approximately 10%-40% of these cases, and uncontrolled pelvic bleeding is the main contributing factor with exsanguination as the leading cause of death within the first 24 hours. Successful management depends on accurate diagnostic staging and control of fracture-related hemorrhage. To improve the survival of these patients, the source of hemorrhage needs to be identified during the early phase of resuscitation for enabling rapid control of bleeding. Nontherapeutic laparotomy should be avoided in the initial phase, concentrating instead on arresting pelvic hemorrhage (2) . The total time from patient injury to stopping the hemorrhage critically affects the outcome in which early whole-body CT plays an important role and improves the outcome (evidence level 3) (1, 3) . There is, however, no evidence that immediate whole-body CT is superior to conventional imaging and selective CT scanning in patients with severe trauma (4) . In pelvic trauma, the negative predictive value of contrast extravasation is close to 100%, and thus, the pelvis will not be the source of hemorrhagic shock (evidence level 4) (5). The CT injury assessment provides the indication for and guides arterial embolization in a patient with stable injury. In very unstable patients, CT should be followed immediately by surgery or balloon occlusion to control bleeding (evidence level 2) (1, 6, 7, 8) . First-line treatment should include temporarily stabilizing the pelvic ring and secondarily preperitoneal packing and/or embolizing the artery depending on the organization of the local trauma center (9) . Patients who demonstrate arterial bleeding on CT or who are hemodynamically unstable despite pelvic wrap are candidates for IR treatment. External fixation is mostly effective in controlling bleeding from bony and venous injury; if used in arterial bleeding, it may compromise the performance of embolization. The abnormalities, which represent embolization targets, include active bleeds, blush on CT, and/or vascular injuries (slow flow, irregularity in diameter, obstruction/cut-off sign with no-flow, arterial dissection, pseudo-aneurysm, and arteriovenous shunt). Angiography of the iliac bifurcation and common iliac arteries is performed together with that of the internal iliac arteries, femoral artery and its branches, and recurrent branches of the external iliac artery. No visible extravasation does not exclude an active bleed or vascular injury as the bleed might be intermittent with arterial collapse or arterial spasm which may recur when hemodynamics is restored. Embolization is highly effective (close to 100%) in stopping arterial bleeding in the context of pelvic injury (1) and therefore, justifies readily available access to this technique (24/24 hours, 7/7 days) in all level 1 trauma centers (9) . The aim of arterial embolization is to obtain hemostasis without causing ischemic complications (by obstructing the artery involved proximal to the pre-capillary collaterals). Arterial embolization performed too proximally (proximal to the arterial collaterals) carries a risk of failing in terms of stopping the bleeding and re-bleeding. Excessively distal arterial embolization (distal to the pre-capillary collaterals) may cause ischemic tissue necrosis (9) . Catheterization of the contralateral internal iliac artery to the bleeding side should always be performed after embolization of the target bleeding artery to observe if there is cross-over collateral arterial supply to the bleeding region. There are three types of embolization agents: 1) resorbable gelatin foam which provides temporary (approximately 4-6 weeks) proximal mechanical thrombotic obstruction. 2) Coils provide permanent thrombotic obstruction (or even mechanical if the packaging is dense or hydrocoils or plugs are used). The use of fibrous or active coils improves the occlusive effectiveness of the implantable device. Coagulopathy results in a reduction in the thrombogenic effectiveness of fibrous coils. 3) Liquid agents provide permanent mechanical obstruction. Their effectiveness is independent of the presence or absence of coagulopathy but they carry a risk of distal embolization. They can be used for non-selective embolization if hemostasis using gelatin foam has failed and in patients who are eligible for selective embolization with a target which is inaccessible by selective catheterization particularly if the patient is at high risk of re-bleeding from anastomoses (9) . Glues can be delivered rapidly and can be used in extremis patients. Onyx requires preparation and slow delivery and cannot be used in extremis patients. Non-selective embolization with unilateral or bilateral obstruction of the internal iliac artery trunks using gelatin foam might be indicated in unstable patients, in patients who are stable with multiple bleeding targets, and if selective embolization has failed. If unstable hemodynamics persists on the angiography table, patients should be investigated for recanalization of the internal iliac arteries (as a result of release of spasm and restoration of normal volemia) and where appropriate, further embolization of the internal iliac arteries should be performed. If the internal iliac arteries have not recanalized, patients should be investigated for arterial bleed from another territories using dedicated angiography. Pseudoaneurysms require the artery to be embolized both proximal and distal to the pseudoaneurysm (\"sandwich\" packing) to prevent back door bleeding. Distal pseudoaneurysms, C RSE however, can be treated by obstructing the feeding artery proximal to the pseudoaneurysm only. Recurrent bleeding through anastamoses must be excluded with contralateral (internal iliac artery) and ipsilateral diagnostic arteriography. Complications after embolization are rare. For both surgical and IR treatments, complications are difficult to discriminate from those caused by the injury itself. Groin hematoma (particularly in coagulopathy) and more specific complications like gluteal, bladder, uterine, or rectal wall necrosis have been described after pelvic embolization. Sciatic and femoral nerve paralyses have also been described. Lower limb ischemia (particularly after prolonged balloon occlusion) and spinal cord arterial ischemia are also potential results after embolization. Most of these complications are described in case reports and in some cases might also be ascribed to the traumatic injury itself. Sexual dysfunction frequently occurs after pelvic trauma, and its incidence is not obviously increased by embolization. There is no significant increase in the risk of most evaluated long-and short-term complications in trauma patients who underwent internal iliac artery embolization versus those who did not. However, internal iliac artery embolization is associated with a marginally significant increased rate of buttocks, thigh, or perineal paresthesia (evidence level 3) (10) . The infection rate after pelvic embolization and internal fixation of acetabular fractures has been shown to be approximately 4% and did not increase compared with that of patients who did not undergo embolization but underwent internal acetabular fracture fixation (therapeutic evidence level 3) (11) . Embolization should be used to manage arterial bleeding resulting from pelvic trauma and should precede treatment other than pelvic binder (evidence level 3) (1). To learn the possibilities of interventional management of lesions 3. To learn the technical challenges of treating major arterial trauma Major artery trauma is generally associated with acute life-threatening situations for the patient because of relevant blood loss with consecutive hypovolemic shock and urgent treatment is indicated. In patients with major artery trauma, there is one simple rule: treat first, what kills first. As no randomised controlled trials are available in literature, evidence-based level of information about treatment options is low. With the surgical or interventional approach, two different invasive treatment options can be chosen depending on the settings in the respective trauma centres and on the skills and experience of the operators. With respect to interventional repair, either repair by endograft placement or vessel occlusion by embolisation may be performed. Endograft placement must be preferred when perfusion of the distal vasculature and target organs must be preserved. Adequate sizing of the specific endograft devices is of outmost importance to cover the bleeding site sufficiently. The interventionalist has to take into account that patients with major artery trauma are usually unstable and hypotonic and that target vessels may show spasms. Once an endograft is deployed at the lesion site, the bleeding is stopped immediately. No further action is necessary in the short-term follow-up besides regular examinations of such patients. Embolisation of the major artery may be the intervention of choice if the target artery can be occluded as collaterals maintain the perfusion of the distal vasculature or if the loss of a particular organ function is acceptable. During embolizing procedures at bleeding sites, it is mandatory to occlude both the \"front door\" and the \"back door\". In ruptured arteries, it is sometimes impossible to cross the lesion sites with wires and catheters; thus, surgical repair is the method of choice. When embolizing, it is also mandatory to pack the vessel segment completely with the chosen embolizing materials to stop the bleeding immediately. The interventionalist must be aware that arteries with bleeding sites have spasms and that the embolisation may be insufficient when arteries relax and widen post intervention. Thus, a close short-term follow-up with adequate imaging may be indicated. As both interventional approaches, i.e. endograft placement and embolisation of the major artery, should be performed as definite therapy within a very limited time range after diagnosis, the interventionalist must be skilled and experienced. The specific materials and machinery must be available and accessible on a 24/7 basis as well as a dedicated team must be present in the angio suite. Last but not least, interventional repair of major artery trauma should be part of an interdisciplinary algorithm in the acute treatment setting of such patients. Therefore, continuous and comprehensive education and training are basic prerequisites of an interdisciplinary team that offers interventional repair of major artery trauma on a 24/7 basis. ",

To learn how to avoid complications by recognising the risks during patient assessment The armamentarium of interventional radiology (IR) includes numerous treatment alternatives ranging from standard minimally invasive diagnostic techniques to every day routine interventions and even innovative approaches for cases otherwise considered untreatable. Pre-assessment and consenting of the patient are pillars of utmost importance for a safe and efficacious practice. Patient contact prior to IR procedures should be extensive and detailed in order to be possible for the interventionist to gather all the necessary clinical information. Whether or not the patient is receiving anticoagulation medication, whether the patient is allergic to contrast material, and whether the patient has abnormal renal function requiring prophylaxis for contrast-induced nephropathy are important issues requiring concern in order to avoid complications and thus augment safety and efficacy of each technique. Furthermore, a detailed description of patient's specific health issues along with the familial and personal medical records will provide invaluable information for the correct and appropriate therapy selection from the IR armamentarium. The Cardiovascular and Interventional Society of Europe has produced a checklist for IR, aiming to ensure that forgetting key steps in patient preparation, intraprocedural care, and postoperative care be avoided; additionally, the adoption of the checklist can ensure that patient's personal health issues will be recognized before time and dealt with appropriately. Informed consent is the process by which the interventionist provides appropriate information to the patient so that he/she may make a voluntary choice to accept or refuse treatment. The basis of this process stands upon the patient's legal and ethical right to select what happens to him/her and upon the interventionist's ethical duty to involve the patient in his/her own decision for healthcare. A full and detailed informed consent should be obtained during patient contact prior to IR procedures and should include a discussion of the nature of the decision/procedure, mentioning any reasonable alternatives to the proposed intervention, including the relevant risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to each alternative.",

To learn how to deal with post-therapeutic clinical issues (pain, post-embolisation etc.) Interventional radiology is a clinical specialty that requires the interventional radiologist to assess the patient prior to any intervention, determine the optimal treatment plan taking in to consideration the relative merits of other treatment modalities and explain this to patients to gain appropriate consent within a partnership model of care, optimise the patient for intervention and deal with potential side-effects or complications, as well as provide longer term follow-up and care after completion of the procedure. In addition, it is vital that data on patient selection, procedures, and outcomes are entered into appropriate registries or research or audit databases to provide confidence that high-quality outcomes are achieved as well as maintained and areas of improvement are identified. Even when there are some uncertainties and contradictions, there is a plethora of information and guidance in nearly all areas of IR practice. To implement this in everyday practice, it is essential to make appropriate use of safety checklists, standardized protocols, and patient pathways whilst being aware of the unique implications and suitability of such approaches in individual patients being treated so that care can be personalized whilst maintaining high standards of safety.

This showed that angioplasty (and the majority was simple angioplasty with no stents) could successfully be performed, with acceptable immediate complications. Indeed within the confines of that randomised trial there was no difference in the immediate significant neurological outcomes between angioplasty and endarterectomy (CEA). However, the CAVATAS trial came in for considerable criticism, in that the overall event rates for both CEA and angioplasty was higher than would have been hoped. On reflection, perhaps it was inevitable because the patients recruited to this trial were both symptomatic (therefore at high risk of recurrent and procedure related stroke) and at high risk of CEA (otherwise there was no equipoise and uncertainty to allow randomisation). As a result of this, and other trials (for example the Leicester Trialwhich was stopped due to the high event rate during stenting 2 ), further investigation into the procedure was undertaken. In addition, the environment was a challenging one, as CEA was (and is) a procedure that has been very carefully investigated and one that is beloved of the vascular surgical community. Over the following years CAS has developed, continuously under scrutiny and criticism from traditional vascular surgery 3 , into a much more mature procedure, which continues to develop. It has been noticeable that the level of industry enthusiasm for CAS waned for a while, as a direct result of the relentless skepticism of the establishment. However, the march of medicine away from large open operations towards the minimally invasive and medical therapy/prevention is compelling. There remains considerable variation in the rates of CAS throughout the world, with the proportion of symptomatic patients being treated by CAS ranging from 0% (Denmark) to 19% (USA) 4 . CAS has survived and is undergoing resurgence. One may ask why this is so? It probably comes from a combination of drivers, firstly that trials assessing modern CAS techniques have been completed, and long term follow up data are now available. Secondly, acute stroke thrombectomy has been shown to be effective (see later), and carotid bifurcation disease (and its treatment) is integral to these therapies.",

            "text": "In 2012 a Cochrane Library review of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and stenting for carotid artery stenosis was published 5 , and included data from trials published as early as 1998. Also included in the analysis were results from the ICSS, SPACE and EVA3S (all randomised trials of patients who were recently symptomatic). In all there were 16 trials included which involved 7572 patients. In patients who had symptomatic carotid artery disease and were considered at \"standard\" surgical risk, endovascular treatment was associated with a higher risk of having, within the first 30 days, death or any stroke, death or any stroke or myocardial infarction, and any stroke. It was noted that the odds ratio for the same outcomes were not different between CAS and CEA in patients under 70 years of age (0R 1.16 range 0.80-1.67), but were higher in patients of 70 years and over. This relationship between age and peri-procedural strokes was confirmed in the CREST Trial 6 , with equal risk at around the slightly lower age of 64 years. The treatment-by-age interaction was not altered by symptomatic status (CREST included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients) or by sex. However when the data in the systematic review were interrogated for the rate of death and major or disabling stroke, they did not differ significantly between CAS and CEA. In addition endovascular treatment was associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction, cranial nerve palsy and haematoma. Considering more long-term outcomes in the 2012 review, the rate of ipsilateral stroke after the peri-operative period was not different, comparing CEA and CAS. Restenosis of the treated segment was seen to be more common after endovascular treatment, but it should be remembered that this group included treatment with angioplasty as well as stents, and restenosis is only relevant if this translates to clinical problems, such as recurrent stroke (see later). It is interesting to note that in the trial data, cranial nerve palsy is not regarded/recorded as a neurological event. Of course it is not a cerebral event, but it is neurological one, which in the ICSS Trial was 5.5% in the peri-procedural period 7 , in time the majority recover. More recently the long-term results from two important randomised trials have become available. The 10 year results of the CREST 8 and the ICSS trials 9 . The CREST trial included 2502 patients who were randomly assigned to stenting or endarterectomy at 117 centres. The peri-procedural composite end point of stroke, death or myocardial infarction did not differ significantly between the two groups. As in the Cochrane review there were more peri-procedural strokes in the stenting group, but fewer myocardial infarctions. The 10 year risk of the primary composite end point (any stroke, myocardial infarction or death during the peri-procedural period or ipsilateral stroke thereafter) did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was also no difference at any other year of follow up between 1 and 9 years. The CREST Trial included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and there were no treatment differences according to the symptomatic status. As far as restenosis was concerned, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the percentage who had restenosis or underwent revascularization. The ICSS trial included only patients who had recently been symptomatic from a high-grade carotid artery stenosis. 1713 patients were included in the study at 50 centres worldwide. They were followed up for a maximum of 10 years (median 4.2 years). The cumulative 5-year risk of fatal or disabling strokes did not differ between the two treatment arms (6.4% CAS v 6.5% CEA). Any stroke was more frequent in the stenting group (8.9% v 5.8%), but the excess number were mainly non-disabling strokes. The distribution of modified Rankin scale scores at 1 year, 5 years or final follow up did not differ significantly between the groups. This demonstrated that in symptomatic patients treated with either CAS or CEA there was an equivalent ability of the two treatments in stroke prevention, up to 10 years after treatment. CAS was associated with a higher procedure-related risk of non-disabling stroke than CEA (amounting to 1 extra stroke per 156 patient-years of follow up), but that functional ability did not differ overall. Both treatments seemed to be equally preventive against ipsilateral stroke and severe restenosis of the treated carotid artery. It is also of interest to consider, not only the long-term consequences of neurological events, but also the effect of peri-procedural myocardial infarction. In the CREST Trial, peri-operative heart attack was associated with a 3.5 fold increased risk of death at 4 years 10 . Thus, myocardial events cannot just be considered as events that do not result in subsequent risk, even if recovered from, at the time or considered a simple biochemically discovered event. As the CAS procedure has developed over time, it has become more complex and the equipment has become more sophisticated. This includes the routine use of stents rather than simple angioplasty balloons, low profile balloons and cerebral protection devices. As data started to become available indicating that CAS was/is a viable alternative to CEA (in patients suitable for both), one of the arguments against the use of CAS was the equipment cost, and therefore the overall cost. This additional up front cost for devices needed to be considered on the background of a procedure that required local rather than general anesthetic, was generally quicker to perform, and required less hospital and high dependency care. A cost utility analysis was performed from the ICSS trial 11 . Published in 2016, the mean costs per patient were $10,477 for the stenting group and $9,669 in the endarterectomy group. There were no differences in mean quality adjusted life years per patient or in the adjusted costs between groups.",

The exact indications for, and techniques are yet to be defined, however there are a number of case series showing the potential benefit of combined CAS and thrombectomy which is sufficiently compelling to have CAS skills listed as a requirement for training in stroke thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS There remains controversy surrounding the role of CAS in stroke prevention. The published evidence would indicate that patients should expect a higher risk of peri-procedural minor stroke if they have CAS compared with CEA. However, it is to be expected that the effects of this will even out in the 6-12 month period following the intervention, and that the individual functional ability having had either treatment will be equivalent taken out to a 10 year time period. There is a higher risk of a peri-procedural myocardial event if CEA is undertaken, and that this will translate into a higher risk of a fatal cardiac event. Cranial nerve injury has not been included in the neurological events associated with CEA, it is likely to occur in around 5% of patients in the peri-procedural period, and that like, minor stroke, these are likely to recover in time. Younger patients (less than 70 years old) are more suited to CAS, and have better outcomes than those in an older age group, which possibly reflects adverse aortic arch anatomy and disease. Patients not included in the randomised/comparative trials, who are at high risk of recurrent stroke, and are also high risk for CEA, should be considered for suitability of CAS (including restenosis, a history of radiotherapy, high carotid bifurcation or previous recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). In the context of acute stroke, and large vessel occlusions being considered for thrombectomy, tandem CAS may be performed This is in the expectation that it will aid in the success and long term benefit, but this has yet to be confirmed.

To learn about the importance of individual anti-aggregation sensitivity testing for successful medical management 3. To learn and understand the limitations of medical management Although aggressive medical therapy has been shown to reduce the degree of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and prevent distal embolization, there are several efficacy and safety concerns that need to be taken into consideration. This lecture aims to summarize the current available evidence regarding potential limitations of medical treatment in the non-invasive management of asymptomatic and symptomatic CAS. Main strengths and limitations of the best medical therapies including double antiplatelets, highdose statins, and effective blood pressure and diabetes control will be outlined. The main focus of this presentation will be on the association of intensive medical management with potential complications from the drug regimens used, including intracerebral or gastrointestinal hemorrhagic complications, rhabdomyolysis, renal impairment, syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, cerebral hypoperfusion, and cognitive decline. Potential interactions between drugs will be further discussed. Concerns regarding the efficacy of best medical management compared with that of revascularization procedures in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic CAS will also be summarized. In the conclusion of the presentation, all potential limitations of medical management with the corresponding levels of evidence will briefly be reviewed and an optimal decision-making algorithm will be highlighted. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is still associated with higher peri-procedural cerebrovascular events (CEs) than those with vascular surgery. Roadsaver carotid artery stent is a double-layer micromesh stent that reduces plaque prolapse and embolization by improving plaque coverage. Its clinical impact on short-and long-term neurological outcomes is poorly known.",

The restenosis rate does not seem to be different from that of other stents, but larger and properly addressed clinical studies are recommended to better investigate this issue. Benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) is very common in elderly men. Symptoms associated with this obstruction are summarized as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which have a major impact on the quality of life (QoL). According to studies, LUTS related to BPO affects up to 60% of men between 50 and 60 years of age, and two third of patients with severe LUTS are not happy with their current urinary situation. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is considered the surgical \"gold-standard\" treatment in symptomatic patients. Due to well-known peri-and postoperative complications of TURP, including long-term urinary incontinence in up to 2% as well as erectile dysfunction in up to 6.5%, prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) has gained special interest in the interventional radiological community and among affected patients.",

            "text": "Since the first publication on PAE as an alternative method in patients suffering from BPO in 2010, a variety of different studies have been published. During the first years, several retrospective single-center studies showed promising results regarding the reduction of the international prostate symptom score (IPSS), improvement of the quality of life (Qol) as well as significant reduction in the prostate volume, and improvement in the urodynamics of patients. An important issue was the relatively low complication rate of PAE in all these studies. In 2014, the first prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing PAE with TURP showed a similar reduction of IPSS, gain in Qol, as well as improvement in the urodynamic studies after 24 months in both groups. The PAE group had a significantly more number of minor complications, especially early ones. A year later, a second randomized trial comparing 15 PAE patients with 15 TURP patients showed similar results regarding IPSS and QoL but better urodynamic results for the TURP group after 12 months. Long-term data have been published in 2016, confirming the good clinical success in up to 76% of patients after 5 years. PAE has the potential to become an alternative to surgical or perhaps medical treatment in patients with LUTS due to BPO. It is minimally invasive, can be performed without the need of hospitalization, and has a low rate of complications. More randomized controlled trials with more patients and a longer follow-up compared with surgical or medical therapies are mandatory to finally reach level 1a evidence.",

            "text": "PErFecTED technique Proximal embolization first Initial pelvic angiography is performed to evaluate iliac vessels and the prostate arteries. Selective digital subtraction arteriogram of the internal iliac artery with a 5-French cobra or vertebral diagnostic catheter placed at the common internal iliac trunk is performed to assess the blood supply to the prostate and perform the internal vesical artery (IVA) catheterization under an ipsilateral 25\u00b0-55\u00b0 oblique view. We have started to use the new Carnevale's prostate catheter (CPC), a 5-French guiding catheter dedicated to pelvic arteriograms. After entering the inferior vesical artery, the vasodilator (nitroglycerine or isosorbide mononitrate) is injected through the microcatheter to prevent vasospasm and increase artery size for facilitating microcatheter navigation and distal positioning. The microcatheter should cross any branch collateral to the bladder, rectum, corpus cavernosum, gonad, or penis and be placed distally into the prostatic artery before its branching to the central gland (urethral group of arteries) and peripheral zone (capsular group of arteries). Collimation with a very slow embolic injection using a 1-cc syringe is highly recommended. We use 100-300-\u03bcm and 300-500-\u03bcm trisacryl gelatin microspheres. The association of both sizes can be an alternative. However, any embolic agent can be used. To each 2-mL syringe of microspheres, we add 10 mL of iodinated contrast medium and 10 mL of saline, resulting in a total volume of 22 mL comprising 50% contrast and 50% normal saline solution. When reaching \"near stasis,\" a manual injection of contrast is performed with a 3-cc syringe before proceeding to the second step of observing any collateral shunts.",

When possible, the urethral and capsular intraprostatic groups of arteries should be embolized separately. After moving forward into the intraprostatic branches, a very slow manual injection of DSA may demonstrate some of these microvessels, and more embolics can be delivered. Be cautious during injection because extravasation may occur if the microcatheter is wedged into the gland. At this point, 300-500 \u03bcm should be used to reduce the risk of non-target embolization. After this second and true stasis, the microcatheter should be retracted to the origin of the IVA and a manual contrast injection run should be performed for final control and to search for additional prostatic branches.

To learn about the available beads to perform drug-eluting beads TACE for HCC 3. To learn about safety and results of drug-eluting beads TACE for HCC Drug-eluting beads (DEBs), introduced over a decade ago, have been proposed as a valid tool that increases the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and reduces systemic and hepatic toxicity, thereby allowing selective and prolonged intratumoral drug release [1] . Although initial clinical experiences in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reported excellent results in terms of toxicity, radiological tumor response, and overall survival [2] [3] [4] , subsequent studies comparing DEB-TACE with lipiodol-TACE have reported conflicting results [5, 6] . The multicenter European Precision V randomized trial did not show a statistically significant improvement in radiological tumor response in the total enrolled population [7] . Nonetheless, the lower toxicity profile of DEB-TACE allowed improvement in tumor response in subgroups of patients, with more fragile clinical conditions [7] . In 2014, the multicenter Precision Italia trial reported no significant advantages in overall survival with DEB-TACE compared with that with lipiodol-TACE [8] . However, the safety profile of DEB-TACE was further confirmed. Finally, a recent monocentric randomized study has reported no advantage of DEBs compared with bland embolization. Thus, the debate on how to perform transarterial treatments of HCC is still ongoing [9] . Despite these results, DEBs are still widely used in clinical practice. In fact, DEB-TACE offers the advantage of high tolerability and low toxicity, allowing safe treatment in patients with more extensive tumor load and/or fragile clinical conditions (such as patients with Child-Pugh B) [7] . Moreover, recent cost-effectiveness analyses have demonstrated that, despite the increased costs of DEBs compared with those of lipiodol, overall procedural costs of DEB-TACE are reduced because of the improved safety profile, which reduces the duration of hospitalization, rates of complications and readmissions, and ultimately, the consumption of inpatient and outpatient resources [10, 11] . Moreover, DEBs are currently under further improvement. Smaller particles have been introduced that can upload higher drug doses in the attempt to increase the therapeutic efficacy [12] [13] [14] . Particles are also under investigation to determine a potential optimal platform for superselective intratumoral delivery of novel drugs, such as molecular-targeted agents [15] , which may enable expansion of the horizons of TACE in patients with HCC. C RSE 15 To learn about different materials used and their potential complications In the field of vascular anomalies, the treatment of low-flow vascular malformations constitutes the majority of IR work. This work very often starts with MR imaging and establishing the correct diagnoses, followed by information on the patient and correction of various misunderstandings regarding the disease and treatment. The treatment of low-flow malformations is aimed at diminishing symptoms such as pain or disfigurement. The lesions are congenital and although present at birth, they often become symptomatic later during childhood. Paediatric patients are challenging in different ways. They very often need anaesthesia not only for the actual procedure but also for MRI. The procedure can be challenging because of the small anatomic structures. The dose of the sclerosing agent has to be adjusted depending on the weight of the child. Pain management in the postoperative period must be assessed. Where relatively localised vascular malformations can be treated successfully by IR using sclerotherapy, the more extensive malformations need a multi-disciplinary approach involving orthopaedic and/or plastic surgery treatment. Sclerotherapy can be used for local symptomatic areas. Patients with large venous malformations affecting an entire limb often have coagulation issues that have to be corrected before sclerotherapy or surgical procedures. The treatment involves puncturing the malformation using ultrasound guidance and injecting the sclerosant after establishing correct needle tip location. Various sclerosants are used. For venous malformations, sodium tetradecyl sulphate is a common material but absolute ethanol, polidocanol or bleomycin is also used. For the treatment of lymphatic malformations, many agents can be used. They work by inducing inflammatory changes in the lining of the cavities. The agent very often depends on availability and local knowledge. The treatment is effective in ca. 70% cases often requiring more than one procedure. Absolute ethanol is not only the most effective agent but also the agent with the most complications. Complications can be divided into local and systemic symptoms. Local complications are the most common and include ulceration and/skin necrosis, nerve damage and compartment syndrome. Meticulous technique with careful fluoroscopic monitoring of the sclerosing procedure is mandatory for avoiding these complications. Most skin damage heals spontaneously but a few % need skin grafting. Most skin damage will leave a scar. When using absolute ethanol, the maximum recommended dose is 1 ml/kg per procedure. The maximum volume per injection is 0.2 ml/kg with 10 minutes between injections. Systemic complications are rare and almost always occur when using absolute ethanol. They include cardiac arrest and pulmonary hypertension with acute cor pulmonale. Renal failure and pulmonary emboli have also been reported. The treatment of systemic complications is symptomatic. ",

A huge array of malformations can co-exist in this way but there are some patterns that are observed more commonly than others. Historically, these have been given a variety of names, many of which are eponymous and poorly defined, such as Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome and Proteus syndrome. Such nomenclature has led to much confusion in the medical community regarding the diagnosis and more importantly, the treatment of these conditions. It is now better understood that almost all of these 'syndromes' or clusters of malformations are related to underlying somatic mutations in growth genes. Currently, the most commonly recognised mutation lies in the PIK3CA gene, giving rise to abnormal activation of the PIK3-AKT-mTOR pathway. PIK3CA mutations are also wellrecognised in a number of malignant tumours. In the context of this lecture, mosaic somatic mutations in PIK3CA underlie many of the complex overgrowth syndromes and are also recognised in an increasing number of isolated malformations [1, 2] . This is of significance on two counts: it suggests that medical therapies can be used to target overgrowth at a cellular level and it, hopefully, encourages a more simplistic and methodical approach to treatment, recognising that the condition as a whole cannot be cured by any one surgical or IR intervention. The use of sirolimus (rapamycin) to treat what is now increasingly commonly labelled as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) is widely debated, but it is clear that such medical therapies are still in their infancy [3] . More specific gene mutations need to be identified so that the vast range of differing phenotypes can be targeted more effectively. Patients with complex overgrowth syndromes require a truly multidisciplinary approach. Vascular malformations occurring as part of a wider syndrome can be challenging to treat, as they occur in difficult-to-reach sites and they often present late. These can include the urogenital tract, mesentery, bone marrow and orbit. These patients may well not present directly to an IR clinic and radiologists may need to reach out to other specialties to find these patients. As observed in the past for so many other conditions, it is often to the onus of the IR to suggest minimally-invasive interventions and encourage collaborative and innovative approaches for treatment. IR is well-placed to offer innovative treatments for some aspects of these conditions that are not traditionally part of the vascular malformation tool box. These include endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) for malformations with a predominantly 'dysplastic-vein' type anatomy and cryoablation for more solid overgrowth lesions [4] [5] [6] . This lecture will cover some more innovative applications of basic sclerotherapy techniques and suggest uses for EVLT and cryoablation in the treatment of some complex overgrowth conditions.",

The biggest challenge in treating patients with calcific lesions is the inability of therapeutic drugs to penetrate through the media-intima calcium to reach the vessel wall. In this study, ultrasound plasty associated with local paclitaxel delivery was compared with drug-eluting balloon for the treatment of femoral-popliteal disease in patients with critical limb ischemia. Material and methods: This single-center, single-blinded randomized trial included 56 patients with critical limb ischemia randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: 28 patients (control group) were treated with DEB and 28 patients (study group) were treated with ultrasound followed by local administration of paclitaxel in liquid mixture with iopromide 370 at 1\u03bcg/mm3. In the study group, the mean lesion length was 168.8mm and 21 patients had calcifications. In the control group, the mean lesion length was 164mm and 23 patients had calcifications. Results: No adverse procedural events were observed. At the 6-month follow-up, no patient suffered from myocardial infraction, underwent amputation, or died in either group. At 18 months, the rate of TLR was 7.6% (2/26) and the rate of amputation was 0% (0/26). In the control group, the rate of TLR was 44% (11/25) and the rate of amputation was 20% (5/25). Conclusion: Ultrasound-enhanced delivery of paclitaxel was associated with improved patency, less need for TLR, and less amputations.",

Material and methods: Medical databases were searched with the PRISMA statement, and 39 RCTs (including five 3-arm studies) comprising 2,983 patients with a 12-month median follow-up (range, 3-24 months) were analyzed in total. Outcome measures included improvements in the maximal walking distance capacity (MWD; meters on treadmill) and quality of life (QoL; SF-36 and EQ-5D instruments) compared with the best medical therapy (BMT) as the anchor control treatment. Bayesian random effects models were employed (WinBUGS). Results: There were significant improvements in MWD with PTA (+85m, 95%CrI: +4 to +170), SET (+180m, 95%CrI: +130 to +230), and PTA+SET (+290m, 95%CrI: +180 to +390). SET was better than PTA alone (MWD difference +85m, 95%CrI: +16 to +170). PTA+SET was the best treatment with an MWD difference over SET of +110m (95%CrI: +16 to +200). QoL was significantly and strongly improved only in case of PTA+SET (QoL Cohen's d standardized effect size 1.8; 95%CrI: 0.21 to 3.4) . Results were stable on sensitivity and consistency analyses without any significant publication bias.",

A femoral artery model was used to demonstrate peripheral interventions within the anatomy of the human arterial system with the texture, tactile feel, and additional function of extracorporeal driven flow. Applied to clinical training simulations and pre-clinical testing, this model is designed to offer a superior alternative to benchtop and virtual simulations. Material and methods: In six cadavers, extracorporeal flow was introduced into the femoral artery of both legs. A distal port was most commonly located within the dorsalis pedis artery to form a circuit. Antegrade pulsatile flow introduced within the circuit (200-400 mL/minute) facilitated fluoroscopically guided endovascular interventions such as angioplasty and stenting at various arterial locations. Interventions are assessed using fluoroscopic, CT imaging, and ultrasound imaging.",

Results: Technical success was achieved in 100% patients in both techniques. The results after 6 months of PAE were a decrease of 25 points in IPSS, an increase of 3 points in IIEF, and a decrease of 37.2% in PV. All patients with acute urinary retention could remove bladder catheter 3 weeks after PAE. There were no complications, and only one patient (14%) had pain after embolization.

Boardman 2 1 Department of Radiology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom, 2 Radiology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom Purpose: PAE is rapidly establishing itself as a robust treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The use of PAE in haematuria/ haematospermia in the presence of BPH and prostatic carcinoma is less well-established. Material and methods: Fifteen consecutive patients with haematuria/haematospermia were included in the prospective study. All patients had prior imaging and cystoscopy to exclude other causes of haematuira. Patients were embolised with PVA particles (200 \u03bcm) and followed up at 3 months and 12 months following the procedure. QOL questionnaires, IPSS, IIEF, urodynamics and clinical review were all employed to assess the success of the treatment. Results: All 15/15 cases were technically successful with bilateral PAE being performed. All cases of haematuria resolved by the 3-month follow-up (100%). Of the 2 cases of haematospermia, 1 had fully resolved at 3 months (50%) and the other fully resolved at 6 months (100%) (noted at the 12-month review). If BPH was present, there was a reduction in lower urinary tract symptoms noted by improvements in QOL indices, IPSS, IIEF and urodynamics. There was continued success even if the patient was subsequently anticoagulated. There was no associated sexual dysfunction. Conclusion: PAE is a very useful technique for controlling the quite debilitating condition of haematuria in patients with normal upper urinary tracts. PAE has shown promise in controlling haematospermia, which is a notoriously difficult condition for Urologists to treat. Controlling haematuria in patients with inoperable cancer and BPH allows an improved QOL. Further studies on PAE and prostatic cancer are warranted.",

We aimed to analyze this distribution and apply it to the step-by-step performance of PAE. Material and methods: In 101 patients (202 hemipelves), we analyzed the pattern of the PA after its penetration into the prostatic lobe using selective angiography. We focused on the distribution of its medial and lateral branches and the presence of large extra-prostatic branches. The presence of a vesical or rectal branch with a common origin was also monitored. Results: We found a single PA in 70% (143) of the 202 hemipelves. In these 143 hemipelves, we classified the intra-prostatic anatomy as follows: types A, B, and C (39% + 11% + 12%) had exclusive intraprostatic feeding with no large extra-prostatic shunting; types D and E (18% + 10%) had intra-prostatic feeding and a large and direct penile or rectal direct shunt, respectively. The occlusion of an extraprostatic shunt to avoid non-target embolization was performed in 0% of type A/C hemipelves, 7% of type B hemipelves, and 87% and 20% of type D and E hemipelves, respectively. The PErFecTED technique could be performed in 46%-64% of the hemipelves depending on the type of artery. Conclusion: The protection of anastomosis is rarely required in type A, B, or C hemipelves but is required in most type D hemipelves and often in type E hemipelves. Purpose: Many studies have shown a global improvement in the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) after PAE; however, no studies have examined how PAE improves voiding and storage symptoms in isolation. Understanding which symptoms PAE can improve is essential for optimal patient selection and also understanding PAE's mechanism of action. Therefore, we examined the effect of PAE on all aspects of IPSS. Material and methods: Patients undergoing PAE for urodynamically confirmed benign outflow obstruction (BOO) from July 2014 to January 2016 were prospectively followed up for 12 months. An IPSS questionnaire was completed prior to PAE and then repeated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure in all patients, with recording of individual IPSS categorical scores. Results: Forty-three patients were identified (mean age 65.1\u00b15.9 years, mean prostate volume 60.0\u00b125.6 cm 3 ), with a mean reduction in global IPSS at 12 months of 15.2\u00b18.4. PAE triggered a significant reduction in both voiding and storage symptoms (paired t-test p<0.001), but voiding symptoms improved to a greater extent (t-test 1.9 vs 1.5, p=0.023). The symptoms that improved most were SS/FC/HL/HTS/CM CIRSE 2016 S119 Free Papers / News on Stage \"incomplete emptying\" and \"intermittency\" (both reduced by a mean 2.2 points). Despite a greater improvement in voiding symptoms after PAE, severe pre-embolization \"frequency\" and \"urgency\" symptoms correlated best with a good symptomatic outcome (Pearson's bivariate correlation r=0.44, p=0.006 and r=0.54, p=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: PAE improves both voiding and storage symptoms, which suggests that neural denervation plays a considerable role in symptomatic improvement. If BOO is confirmed with formal urodynamic studies, severe storage symptoms are the best predictors of a good symptomatic improvement.",

Tapping Radiology, Oxford University Hospitals Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom Purpose: To investigate the clinical impact of performing prostate artery embolization (PAE) on patients with adenomatous-dominant benign prostatic hyperplasia (AdBPH). Material and methods: Twelve patients from the ongoing proSTatic aRtery EmbolizAtion for the treatMent (STREAM) of benign prostatic hyperplasia trial were identified as having AdBPH, defined as two or more adenomas within the central gland of \u22651cm diameter on multiparametric MRI (MP-MRI). These patients were age-matched with patients from the STREAM cohort without AdBPH. Patients were followed up with repeat MP-MRI at 3 months and 1 year. International prostate symptom score (IPSS), international index for erectile function (IIEF), and quality of life assessment from the IPSS and EQ-5D-5S questionnaires were recorded pre-PAE and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year. Results: The mean age of patients was 68 (61-76) years. All patients underwent PAE as a day-case procedure. The technical success in the cohort was 23/24 (96%). Following multivariate analysis, there was a significant reduction in prostate volume post-embolization with a mean reduction of 36% (30-55) in the AdBPH group compared with a mean reduction of 25% in the non-AdBPH group (p=0.04). There was a significant reduction in IPSS in the AdBPH group following PAE when compared with the control group [AdBPH median vs non-AdBPH median IPSS 13 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , p=0.01]. IPSS QOL scores significantly improved in the AdBPH group (p=0.007). There was no deterioration in sexual function in either group post-PAE. Conclusion: This is the first time that AdBPH has been identified as being a predictor of clinical success following PAE.",

The results of the 118 patients in AUR were as follows: 110 (93.2%) had the catheter removed between 2 days and 3 months and 106 (89.8%) and 99 (83.9%) had good results at the mid and long terms, respectively. The results of the 220 patients with prostate volume larger than 100cm 3 were as follows: 190 (86.4%) had a short-term clinical success and 178 (80.9%) and 171 (77.7%) had mid-and longterm clinical successes, respectively. There were 2 major complications, bladder wall ischemia and perineal pain for 3 months. Conclusion: PAE is a safe procedure for patients with BPH with good short-, mid-, and long-term results. Purpose: To compare the imaging quality and adverse effects of hepatic arterial angiography during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization between Iopamidol 250 and Ioversol 320. Material and methods: We enrolled 104 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma prospectively and randomized them into two groups. When angiography was performed, 54 patients received Iopamidol 250 (group A) and 50 patients received Ioversol 320 (group B). The quality of vessel visualization was evaluated by two radiologists (grade 1: clearly visible, grade 2: poorly visible, and grade 3: invisible). The number of hepatocellular carcinomas on hepatic angiography was compared with dynamic CT scan (concordance score 1: same, score 2: more on angiography, and score 0: more on CT scan). The incidence of adverse events and level of creatinine were monitored before and after angiography. Results: The quality of vessel visualization on angiography shows no significant difference (hepatic artery distal branches: p=0.711, right gastric artery: p=0.138, and pancreaticoduodenal artery: p=0.296). Concordance rate of tumor detection on angiography and CT scan was not statistically different between two groups (p=0.945). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the group A and B after angiography (p=0.513). The creatinine level did not increase after angiography in both groups. Conclusion: The iodine concentration of 250 mg/mL, which has low viscosity, would be safe and effective to visualize hepatic arterial branches and to detect hepatocellular carcinoma during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.",

Optimum settings were developed to allow 1) the largest proportion of sequential radiographs to be automatically registered and aligned and 2) to achieve the smallest variation in alignment of reference landmark, as defined by pixel coordinates of the four corners of the L1 vertebral body. This was tested on 119 sets of AP and LAT radiographs of 18 patients. Results: Overall, 110 (92%) AP and 83 (70%) LAT radiographs could be registered and aligned. Changes in bone morphology, most commonly due to a wedge fracture of the lumbar spine, were noted in 39 out of the 45 unaligned radiographs. Aligned radiographs showed low variance of L1 alignment with the SD of positional alignment being only 41 pixels for AP radiographs and 63 pixels for LAT radiographs. Conclusion: Automatic registration and alignment of plain radiographic images in EVAR surveillance is possible. This could improve the sensitivity and utility of plain radiography in detecting stentgraft migration and distortion. ",

The higher SNR is a promise for future decrease in X-ray dose and/or volume of contrast media. KI could provide enough information for achieving proper diagnostic results by performing an X-ray fluoroscopy with contrast media.",

Maschke 1 Purpose: To analyze the feasibility of 2D-PA for quantifying the perfusion reduction following DEB-TACE and to evaluate its potential to monitor arterial stasis during TACE. Material and methods: Twenty patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent 24 DEB-TACE procedures were enrolled in this study. Contrast-enhanced digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was acquired to monitor DEB-TACE. To quantify changes in tumor or tissue perfusion due to DEB-TACE using 2D-PA, the acquired DSA series were post-processed using a dedicated software. A reference region-of-interest (ROI) in a proximal hepatic artery (arterial input) and two distal target ROIs in the embolized tumor and non-targeted liver parenchyma were placed in corresponding areas on DSA pre-and post-DEB-TACE. Time to peak (TTP), peak density (PD), and area under the curve (AUC) were assessed. The ratios of reference ROI to target ROIs for both the embolized tumor and non-targeted parenchyma (TTP tumor/parenchyma / TTP inflow , PD tumor/parenchyma /PD inflow , and AUC tumor/parenchyma / AUC inflow ) pre-and post-DEB-TACE were calculated. Results: Regarding the embolized tumor the ratios PD tumor /PD inflow and AUC tumor /AUC inflow decreased significantly (p<0.0001), whereas the ratio TTP tumor/ /TTP inflow missed significance (p=0.0732). The measured 2D-PA parameters did not change significantly in the non-targeted liver parenchyma (p>0.05). Comparing the embolized tumor and non-targeted liver parenchyma, the ratio PD tumor /PD inflow differed significantly compared with the ratio PD parenchyma /PD inflow pre-TACE (p<0.0001) and the ratio AUC tumor /AUC inflow differed significantly compared with the ratio AUC parenchyma /AUC inflow (p=0.0008). Following DEB-TACE, the ratios PD tumor /PD inflow and PD parenchyma /PD inflow did not differ significantly (p=0.1286), whereas the ratios AUC tumor /AUC inflow and AUC parenchyma /AUC inflow did (p=0.0332). Conclusion: 2D-PA provides an objective approach to quantify perfusion reduction of embolized HCC following DEB-TACE and may therefore be used to determine the precise embolization endpoint and quantify technical success for scientific purposes.",

Kelekis Purpose: Several studies have reported the comparative effectiveness of intradiscal ozone over steroids in the treatment of patients with disc herniations. Although specific protocols vary and a few serious infections have been reported, the technique shows promise as a non-surgical treatment for these patients. The purpose of this investigation is to compare an intradiscal ozone injection to discectomy in patients with lumbar disc herniation through a prospective randomized trial. Material and methods: This is a multicenter randomized study in three countries. Key selection criteria include symptomatic lumbar disc herniation, leg pain greater than 5/10, persistent pain for more than 6 weeks, and no neurological deficit. The gas mixture was created using the Minimus Spine's Triojection System. Triojection uses a sterile syringe cartridge to produce 14 cc of gas at a concentration of 35 \u00b1 3 ug/ml. Gas was slowly injected into the disc and allowed to flow through the herniation and into the epidural space. Leg pain, back pain, and function scores were collected at baseline, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The study was independently monitored.",

They have been followed up for 6 months until now and will be followed up for 2 years. Results: All the patients enrolled (mean 62 years, 50% female) presented a pertrochanteric lesion shown on imaging with an average Mirels score of 9.42 (8) (9) (10) (11) . The procedures were performed by interventional radiologists in 97\u00b133 minutes on an average, including CT scan acquisitions, with 9.2\u00b13.1 ml of cement injected. Hospitalization duration was 2.3\u00b11.4 days. Six patients deceased from cancer progression. One fracture occurred after a median follow-up of 237 days and was attributed to a non-optimal placement of the implant as well as to a rapid tumor progression. Wound healing was achieved in all patients at 6 months, with no case of wound infection, bleeding, leakage, or inflammation. Initial data shows a pain level diminution and an increase in OHS-12 score, indicating that both symptomatic and functional conditions of the patients were improved. Conclusion: This minimal invasive procedure appears as a promising consolidation technique for oncologic patients with a poor performance status. Additional studies should now be conducted on a greater number of subjects to confirm these clinical benefits.",

Worldwide, osteoporosis causes >8.9 million fractures annually. Quality of life is threatened, and mortality and morbidity rates increase following a VCF. Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure to stabilize a VCF, reduce pain, and improve the quality of life and mobility. Material and methods: In total, 354 Medicare patients with painful, acute, or subacute VCFs were prospectively enrolled at 24 sites, with 350 undergoing balloon kyphoplasty. Primary objective was to show statistically significant improvement in four co-primary endpoints (SF-36v2 PCS, EQ-5D, NRS back pain, and ODI) at 3 months. Results: Back pain improved from 8.7 (scale 0-10) by 5.2, 5.4, 6.0, 6.2, and 6 .3 points at the 7-day and 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month time points, respectively (p<0.001 for each).

Roy Purpose: In UK, the majority of juxtarenal aortic aneurysms are treated by fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR). Endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS) with off-label use of chimneys (ChEVAS) offers a novel alternative to FEVAR. Both ChEVAS and FEVAR are complex endovascular interventions and have limitations associated with anatomical suitability. We undertook a comparison of how planned ChEVAS and FEVAR interventions varied in the same patient cohort. Material and methods: An analysis of consecutive patients who underwent FEVAR at our institution between 2013 and 2015 was undertaken. Preoperative CT angiograms were anonymized and sent to two ChEVAS planners with an experience of over 40 ChEVAS interventions. ChEVAS planners were blinded to the study purpose and asked to agree upon a suitable EVAS/ChEVAS plan. The primary outcome was the percentage of FEVAR patients who were anatomically suitable for EVAS/ChEVAS. The secondary outcomes were a comparison of seal zones, number of target vessels, and device cost. Results: Sixty patients, 54 males with median age of 76.3 years (IQR 71.7-79.7) and aneurysm diameter of 62.0 mm (IQR 59.3-69.0) were included. An EVAS-based intervention was possible in 56 (93%). The median seal zone was significantly more distal in EVAS/ChEVAS vs. FEVAR (median zone 8 vs zone 7, Z=\u22126.650, p<0.001). Less target vessels were involved by EVAS/ChEVAS vs FEVAR (Median 2 vs 3, Z=5.908, p<0.001). The cost of the EVAS/ChEVAS device was 66% that of the FEVAR device. Conclusion: EVAS interventions are anatomically applicable to most patients undergoing FEVAR. Seal zones or target vessel numbers should not be used as surrogates of anatomy when comparing outcomes of ChEVAS and FEVAR.",

Bisdas 1 1 Vascular Surgery, St. Franziskus Hospital, M\u00fcnster, Germany, 2 Dept. of Radiology, St. Franzikus Hospital, M\u00fcnster, Germany Purpose: Aim of the study was to evaluate the mid-term performance of Heli-FX EndoAnchors for the treatment of type Ia endoleak in the completion angiography of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Material and methods: Prospectively collected data from 795 patients undergoing EVAR between November 2007 and May 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criterion was the presence of type Ia endoleak in the completion angiography, which was treated directly by endoanchoring. Clinical and radiological data were retrospectively assessed. Primary endpoint was technical success, defined as successful placement of all EndoAnchors without CIRSE Abstract Book S124 CIRSE C RSE evidence of endoleak in the final angiography (CTA). Secondary endpoints were aneurysm-related reinterventions, overall mortality, and aneurysm shrinkage. Results: Seventeen patients (n=17, 1.9%) were included in the present study. Median neck length amounted to 8 mm (interquartile ratio, IQR, [6] [7] [8] [9] and mean infrarenal angle to 44\u00b0\u00b121\u00b0. Technical success amounted to 65% (n=11/17). After a mean follow-up of 24\u00b113 months, all patients were free from type Ia endoleak (88% at 6, 94% at 12, and 100% at 24 months). A single reintervention was performed to treat a type II endoleak with a liquid embolic agent. No aneurysm-related deaths were observed. The mean maximal aneurysm diameter decreased significantly (58\u00b111 mm versus 53\u00b111 mm, P=0.032). Conclusion: Use of the Heli-FX EndoAnchors in the treatment of intraoperative type Ia endoleaks after EVAR shows persistent type IA endoleak in almost 35% of patients, which disappeared in the 2-year CT follow-up in all cases. Possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the change from high to low flow type IA endoleaks after the use of Heli-FX system.",

Material and methods: Twenty-one patients with pararenal aortic aneurysms who underwent ch-EVAR and had two postoperative CT angiography (CTA) studies with an interval of at least 24 months between them were included in the study. CTA-based evaluations were made using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images. Results: During a mean follow-up of 2.7 years (range 2.0-5.75), the mean migration of the aortic stentgrafts amounted to 2.76\u00b12.4 mm. The migration distance per year was 1.15 mm. The mean regression of the aortic aneurysm sac diameter was 3.25 mm (p=0.048). Large aneurysms with a diameter of more than 75 mm were associated with migration of the aortic graft of \u2265 5 mm. The right renal artery angle moved significantly upward by 6.54\u00b0 (p=0.025) and the right renal proximal chimney stentgraft moved significantly downward SS/FC/HL/HTS/CM CIRSE 2016 S125 Free Papers / News on Stage by 7.83\u00b0 (p=0.042). The left renal artery angle also moved upward by 3.04\u00b0 (p=0.667) and the left renal proximal chimney stentgraft moved downward by 6.95\u00b0 (p=0.133). Conclusion: CTA assessment over the mid-term showed statistically significant shrinkage of the aortic aneurysm sac and stable position of the aortic stentgraft (migration of less than 5 mm). A larger number of patients and longer-term CT follow-up data are needed to gain further insight of the interaction of the chimney graft with the aortic endograft and its consequences.",

Zini Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the image quality and diagnostic accuracy of low kV and low contrast media (CM) CT angiography (CTA) for the assessment of abdominal endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). Material and methods: The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Fifty patients referred for CTA after EVAR were prospectively randomized in two groups. The low dose group (LD) performed CTA by using 80 kV and mAs modulation, injecting 50 mL of Iomeprol (Iomeron 400, Bracco@4mL/sec). The standard dose group (SD) performed CTA by using 120 kV and mAs modulation, injecting 80 mL of Iomeprol@4mL/sec. All images were reconstructed using adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). Subjective image quality has been evaluated using a 4-point Likert scale. Objective image quality has been evaluated calculating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The presence and type of endoleak, infection, and occlusion were reported. When available, angiography was used as the gold standard. Results: Forty-seven patients completed CTA; 23 were enrolled in the LD group (21 men, mean age 73.9\u00b16.5 years; mean BMI 27.8\u00b14.5) and 24 in the SD group (20 men, mean age 75.1\u00b17.3 years; mean BMI 28.5\u00b14.8) . Subjective image quality score was 3.3 in LD versus 3.5 in SD (p<0.05). Mean CNR was 6.6\u00b13.7 and 9.5\u00b12.4 and mean SNR was 11.1\u00b14.9 and 10\u00b12.3 in LD and SD, respectively (p=0.07 and p=0.5). The mean dose-length product (DLP) was 1315.2 mGycm (LD) and 2491.8 mGycm (SD) (p<0.003). A total of 7 endoleaks were registered (n=4 in group 1). Conclusion: Low kV and low CM CTA for EVAR assessment result in a significant reduction in radiation and contrast media dose without affecting the image quality and accuracy.",

The results were recorded in terms of arterial pressure change and morphological changes in the renal arteries based on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) at pre-BU, and/or pre-RDN, 7, 28, and 42 days after RDN, respectively, and the pathological changes in the renal arteries 42 days after RDN. Results: There were no procedure-related complications after RDN.

Angioembolization is often the preferred treatment for patients with RAML, but regrowth and postembolization hemorrhage remain a concern. Cryoablation (CA) has been reported to be a safe and feasible minimally invasive nephron-sparing alternative. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of CA in patients with RAML. Material and methods: Sixteen consecutive patients (5 males and 11 females) treated with CA for a total of 19 RAML lesions from 2008 to 2013 were included. One patient with a single lesion was lost to follow-up and thus excluded from the follow-up analysis. Results: In 7/19 lesions, CA was performed as laparoscopic-assisted cryoablation, and in the remaining 12 lesions, CA was performed as percutaneous ultrasound cryoablation. The mean patient age was 46 years . In all cases, the procedure was successfully performed with no conversion to open surgery. One patient developed a hematoma in the left flank and required two portions of blood, and one patient had minor seepage from the laparoscopic port hole and developed subcutaneous emphysema. Follow-up imaging consisted of CT or MRI.

Material and methods: Between September 2014 and January 2017, seven patients (69\u00b115 years) with true (n=4) and false (n=3) VAAs were treated by implanting balloon-expandable stentgrafts (E-ventus \u00ae , Jotec, Germany) using a trans-femoral (n=2) or -brachial (n=5) vascular access. The stentgrafts were placed without prior passing of the landing zone with a sheath. In 3/7 patients, additional coil or plug embolization was performed to prevent retrograde VAA perfusion. Endpoints were technical success (defined as delivery and implantation of the stentgraft in the intended position with complete exclusion of the VAA), peri-procedural complications, and patency.",

It is an observational registry with no clinical decision mandated by the study. For patient enrollment, institutional review board approval and consent is needed, although only de-identified data are used. Currently, institutions from 5 different countries are involved in this project. Collected data include pre-procedural clinical presentation, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, aneurysm information (location, size, and type), embolization technique and material, immediate and long-term results, and complications. Results: We will report the results on 92 patients. This includes 55 patients in the registry and 37 patients from the University of Minnesota registry. A total of 45 visceral artery aneurysms and 47 pseudoaneurysms were included. The most common site for visceral aneurysms in the series was the splenic artery followed by the renal and gastroduodenal arteries. This presentation includes information on aneurysm characteristics, embolization technique and material, technical success, long-term follow-up results, and complications as well the need for re-intervention.

Five (19.2%) minor complications were noted in group A, including 4 small self-limiting pneumothoraces and one small selflimiting peripancreatic hematoma. Patients from group B reported no complications. Histological results in group A accounted for 95% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 95.2% diagnostic accuracy. In group B, mean postoperative reactive C-protein was 41 \u00b1 48.3 mg/L (vs. 155 \u00b1 117.5 mg/L at baseline; P = 0.004). Conclusion: SoftGuard blunt-tipped needle is safe and effective when applied as a coaxial working cannula for percutaneous biopsy or drainage of \"hard-to-reach\" lesions.",

Material and methods: UNI IRB approved this prospective blinded study that compared TRUS-guided random and real-time mpMRI-TRUS fusion prostatic biopsies among 100 consecutive men. We included men with a clinical and laboratorial suspicion of prostate cancer and Likert score \u2265 3 mpMRI. Patients previously diagnosed with prostate cancer were excluded. All patients were subjected to 14-fragment TRUS-guided biopsy (mpMRI data was operator blinded), followed by mpMRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy. Results: An overall increase in cancer detection rate from 56% using random technique to 62% using TRUS-mpMRI fusion biopsy was observed; incremental diagnosis was relevant for clinically significant lesions (Gleason score \u2265 7) because more than 10% of clinically significant lesions were diagnosed using the fusion biopsy technique (40 versus 50 patients). Diagnosis upgrade occurred in 5 patients (5.0%) who demonstrated negative results using random biopsies but clinically significant tumors using the fusion biopsy technique and in 5 patients (5.0%) who were diagnosed with clinically significant tumors using fusion biopsies and clinically insignificant tumors using random biopsies (p = 0.0010).",

Vernhet-Kovacsik Cardio Vascular and Thoracic Radiology, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France Purpose: To assess the incidence of systemic air embolism after transthoracic lung biopsy, and to determine possible influencing factors. Material and methods: Overall, 559 CT-guided lung biopsies performed between April 2014 and May 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Variables analyzed were age, sex, spirometry data, emphysema on CT, target lesion characteristics (location, depth, and nodule size and type), patient position, length of intrapulmonal biopsy path, and number of pleural needle passes. Procedural air embolism and other associated complications (hemoptysis and pneumothorax) and their management and consequences (length of hospitalization and additional action) were recorded. Clinical and CT data of patients with and without air embolism were compared using Chi 2 , Fisher, or Wilxocon test. Results: Twenty-seven (4.8%) patients had air embolism on postprocedure CT. All but one were asymptomatic. Post-biopsy CT detected pneumothorax in 4/27 and alveolar opacities in 10/27. Management included mobilization prohibition, oxygen therapy, respiratory and neurologic monitoring, and repeated CT scans for the 27 patients.",

Material and methods: The UNI Institutional Review Board approved our retrospective study that compared TRUS-guided random and mpMRI-TRUS fusion prostatic biopsy complication rates among 967 consecutive men. We included men with clinical and laboratorial suspicion of prostate cancer and Likert score \u2265 3 mpMRI. In total, 319 patients were subjected to TRUS prostatic biopsy and 648 patients underwent mpMRI-TRUS fusion prostatic biopsy. Complications were divided into immediate (those that occurred during hospital observation period) and late (those that occurred within 5 days after biopsy). Results: In total, 17 grade 2 and 3 complications were noted among patients subjected to TRUS-guided systematic or mpMRI-TRUS fusion prostatic biopsies. Grade 4 and 5 complications were not observed. Among patients who underwent TRUS prostatic biopsy, 6 (1.9%) developed complications, and among those who underwent mpMRI-TRUS fusion prostatic biopsy, 11 (1.7%) developed complications after the procedure (p = 0.873), with no difference in the distribution of early and late complications between these two groups (p > 0.999). Conclusion: The complications were rare and well-defined in both groups, with no critical clinical outcomes and no significant difference in complication rates between the two groups. Despite a high incidence of cores close to the prostatic urethra and additional cores taken, no feature associated with an increased incidence of complications after mpMRI-TRUS fusion prostatic biopsy was identified. Purpose: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of CT-guided transjugular biopsy in an in vitro model. Material and methods: A phantom was designed for performing transvascular biopsies, with targets of various sizes made from acrylic embedded in soft paraffin. A conventional vascular Y-prosthesis served as a vascular bed. All procedures were performed with a commercially available transjugular puncture set with a semi-automated core biopsy needle (Cook, Bloomington, IN) . After a target lesion was identified, the procedure was performed under CT guidance. After the biopsy, a control scan was obtained and the distance from the needle tip to the centre of the target lesion was measured in three directions in space. A total of 50 punctures were performed via the left (n=25) or the right branch (n=25) of the Y-prosthesis. Data was quantitatively analysed. Results: All CT-guided punctures were successfully completed. Size of the targeted lesions ranged from 8.5 to 16 mm. In only four lesions, the exact centre of the lesion was met. The mean distance from the lesion centre was 9.5\u00b15.0 mm and from the lesion surface was 5.3\u00b13.3 mm. There was no correlation between lesion size and precision of the puncture (p=0.34), but a correlation between number of performed procedures and deviation from the target (r=0.62) was observed, indicating a learning curve. Conclusion: CT-guided transjugular liver biopsy appears to be feasible. The precision is not yet sufficient for targeting lesion <20 mm in diameter, but there is a learning curve indicating that smaller lesions may be accessible with sufficient training.",

Purpose: Prostate artery embolization (PAE) is emerging as a safe and efficacious treatment for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but remains a challenging procedure principally due to the complex and variable anatomy of the prostatic arteries. We present a case-control study investigating the use of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) to improve the quality of CTA performed preoperatively for PAE. Material and methods: Patients were identified from an ongoing prospective cohort of patients undergoing PAE (STREAM Trial). Cases where patients received pre-CTA GTN were compared with those where consecutive patients did not receive GTN. CT angiograms were examined for prostate artery visibility, contrast density (Hounsfield units), and cross-sectional area. These were also correlated with PAE technical success, screening time, and radiation dose. Results: A total of 32 prostate arteries were examined on CTA. GTN administration was shown to significantly improve the proportion of scans confidently demonstrating the whole prostate artery (88% vs. 44%, OR=0.1, P=0.023) and the cross-sectional area of the prostate artery (2.5 vs. 1.7mm2) (95% CI=0.08-1.6, P=0.03). There was also a significant reduction in the mean procedural dose in patients receiving GTN (1.5 vs. 2.7Gy, P=0.008). There was no significant difference in prostate artery density, screening time, or technical success. No adverse advents were recorded in either group. Conclusion: CTA is a highly useful tool for the procedural planning of PAE. The quality of preoperative CTA with regards to confidently demonstrating the prostate artery anatomy is significantly increased by the administration of sublingual GTN without any increase in adverse events.",

            "text": "Are formal urodynamic studies an essential investigation prior to prostate artery embolisation ( Purpose: Despite promising early results using PAE, some patients fail to improve irrespective of technical success. Therefore, optimal patient selection is paramount to ensuring good outcomes; however, not all centres conduct formal urodynamic studies to confirm bladder outflow obstruction (BOO). Thus, we explored if formal urodynamics was a useful predictor of sustained symptomatic improvement. Material and methods: Patients undergoing prostate artery embolisation from June 2012 to January 2016 were prospectively followed up. All patients underwent formal urodynamic assessment to confirm BOO in addition to completing an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. Patients subsequently completed non-formal urodynamic assessment and IPSS questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months. Pre-embolisation variables were assessed for correlation with IPSS change at 12 months using the Pearson's bivariate correlation. Results: Eighty-two patients with confirmed BOO were treated with PAE (mean age 64.5 years, mean Abrams-Griffiths score 77.7\u00b133.0, mean post-void residual (PVR) 178.8\u00b1153.9, mean Qmax 8.1\u00b13.0, mean IPSS 22.8\u00b15.3) and were followed up for 12 months. Mean PVR and Qmax improved significantly (PVR 101.3\u00b186.4, p=0.001; Qmax 12.1\u00b17.0, p=0.037) and IPSS reduced to 12.1\u00b17.5. A high Abrams-Griffiths score pre-PAE correlated with a better symptomatic outcome at 12 months (r=0.37, p=0.002), as did detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate (r=0.33, p=0.048). Pre-PAE PVR and Qmax did not correlate well with symptomatic outcomes (r=\u22120.10, p=0.55 and r=\u22120.10, p=0.50, respectively). Conclusion: Formal urodynamic assessment is considerably more reliable at identifying good candidates for PAE; therefore, it should be routinely performed to ensure optimal outcomes. Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be treated by a variety of local and regional interventional therapies, but we may benefit from a more predictive preclinical model to better understand, study, and treat HCC. This study clarifies the value of utilizing woodchucks with HCC for the study of hepatic embolotherapies. Material and methods: Animal Model Woodchuck neonates commonly infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus develop neoplasms similar to human HCCs associated with hepatitis B. Woodchucks with and without tumor were provided by Northeastern Wildlife, Inc. (Harrison, ID). The animal study was approved by the NIH Clinical Center IACUC and performed in accordance with US regulations. Embolic Procedure Animal livers were examined via ultrasound and CT prior to instrumentation. A 3-F introducer sheath was placed in the femoral artery, and 1.7-2.8-F microcatheters were guided by fluoroscopy to select hepatic arteries for diagnostic angiography. Results: Embolic particles (40-150-\u03bcm radiopaque spheres, Biocompatibles UK LTD) were deployed until angiographic stasis was observed. uCT of the explanted liver was conducted. Analysis of segmented arteries provided a 3D geometric and anatomic definition of the tumor-negative and -positive liver. Gross pathology and histology was described. CT and US showed a solid hypervascular tumor without major pools of necrosis, as is common in other IR preclinical medium-sized animal models for liver tumors. Conclusion: These data may help guide future studies using a more predictive HCC model for hepatic embolization. Additional research is needed to refine the methods and validate the model; however, a more realistic HCC model than previously described could be an informative surrogate for clinical research and may be more realistic than rodent or rabbit models. Purpose: Recurrent hemarthrosis is a late complication in up to 1.6% patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In the absence of intrinsic coagulopathy, the probable etiology is bleeding of the hypertrophic vascular synovium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients referred to our center who underwent angiographic embolization of the geniculate arteries for the treatment of recurrent hemarthrosis following TKA. Material and methods: We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients who were referred for embolization of the geniculate artery following TKA between August 2011 and September 2016. Results: A total of 24 embolization procedures were performed on 14 patients. Seven (50%) of these 14 patients underwent one embolization procedure. Because of symptom recurrence, four patients underwent a repeated procedure and three patients underwent a third procedure. All embolization procedures were technically successful. Two patients reported an inguinal hematoma that healed without further treatment. At a mean follow-up of 26.8 months, clinical success was achieved in 12 of the 14 patients (86%). Conclusion: Embolization of the geniculate arteries in our study was a safe and effective treatment for recurrent spontaneous hemarthrosis following TKA. We report 100% technical and 86% clinical success rates. No patient experienced cutaneous ischemic complications even though reinterventions were performed in 50% patients. Our results showed that embolization could probably be the treatment of choice when conservative measures fail. Purpose: To compare CT liver perfusion (CTLP) findings obtained using a dedicated processing tool with those obtained with MRI using gadoxetic acid injection before and after trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment. Material and methods: Twenty patients (9 with cirrhosis) with 57 nodules, suspicious for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) underwent CTLP on a 128 GE CT system. Perfusion maps of the mean slope of increase and blood flow were derived using CT-perfusion body processing tools. ROIs were appropriately drawn on non-treated HCCs or on partially treated tumors. MRI examination was performed on a 1.5-T system at \u00b11 week after CTLP and included DWMRI images and dynamic contrast images acquisition (arterial/hepato-biliary phase) using gadoxetic acid. HCC findings, when confirmed with invasive hepatic angiography (DSA), were treated by TACE. Follow-up was performed with CTLP and MRI.",

Not recognizing type-V prostatic artery can lead to unnecessary catheterization of multiple vessels, which increases the procedure time and use of mdc and radiation exposure. Cone-beam CT should be used to confirm prostate vascularization and evitate non-target embolization. Good clinical results can be obtained through expert hands. Purpose: The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is technically divided into TIPS through the left branch of the portal vein (TIPS-LBPV) and TIPS through the right branch of the portal vein (TIPS-RBPV). To compare outcomes of both techniques in patients with refractory portal hypertension and patients with advanced cirrhosis. Material and methods: Sixty-two TIPS patients were randomly assigned to this study. They were divided into group 1 (31 patients) subjected to TIPS-LBPV and group 2 (31 patients) subjected to TIPS-RBPV. Both groups were prospectively followed up for 2 years after TIPS implantation. Results: The incidences of overall encephalopathy and de novo encephalopathy in the TIPS-LBPV group were significantly lower than those in the TIPS-RBPV group during the follow-up (P = 0.03 and 0.046, respectively). The incidences of rebleeding or reintervention and improvement of ascites were similar between groups (P > 0.05). Patients undergoing TIPS-LBPV required less rehospitalization and incurred less costs than those undergoing TIPS-RBPV (P = 0.036 and 0.039, respectively). There was no significant difference between the two groups in survival based on a survival curve constructed according to the Kaplan-Meier method (P > .05). Conclusion: TIPS-LBPV is more beneficial than TIPS-RBPV. patients who had undergone PARTO were retrospectively evaluated, 15 of whom had gastric varices (GV) and 3 had hepatic encephalopathy (HE). When afferent veins were identified on fluoroscopy, CBCT images were obtained. In patients with incomplete filling of gelfoam into GV, additional gelfoam was injected. Follow-up contrastenhanced CT, upper intestinal endoscopy, and clinical and laboratory data were collected. Results: PARTO procedures were technically successful in all 18 patients. In 2 patients, incomplete filling of gelfoam into GV was detected on CBCT; therefore, additional gelfoam was injected. No procedure-related complication was observed. Follow-up CT obtained within 1 week after PARTO showed complete thrombosis of GV and portosystemic shunt in all 18 patients. Seventeen patients who had more than a 2-month follow-up period showed marked shrinkage or complete obliteration of the thrombosed GV as well as the portosystemic shunts on both CT and endoscopy. No case of variceal bleeding or HE was observed during a mean follow-up period of 181 (range, 46-318) days. Conclusion: PARTO is technically simple and safe and is clinically effective in the treatment of GV and HE. In addition, CBCT can be considered as an adjunct tool to fluoroscopy during PARTO. Purpose: To introduce a modified transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), percutaneous transhepatic intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (PTIPS), and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy in patients with variceal bleeding with chronic portal vein occlusion (CPVO) after splenectomy. Material and methods: 24 cirrhotic patients with CPVO after splenectomy receiving PTIPS between 2010 and 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Indication was variceal bleeding. Success rates, efficacy, and complications were evaluated, with comparison of pre-and post-portosystemic pressure gradient (PPG). Patients' clinical outcomes and shunt patency were followed periodically. Results: PTIPS was successfully placed in twenty-two patients (91.7%) and failed in two. Mean PPG fell from 23.1\u00b16.1 mmHg to 12.4\u00b13.4 mmHg after successful PTIPS (P<0.05). No fatal procedural complications were observed. During the median follow-up of 29 months, shunt dysfunction appeared in five cases with four rebleeding. Hepatic encephalopathy appeared in four cases. Three patients died due to rebleeding, hepatic failure and pulmonary disease, respectively. The other patients remained asymptomatic and shunt patency. Conclusion: PTIPS is a modified TIPS procedure with high success rate, and it is safe and effective for variceal bleeding with CPVO after splenectomy. Retrospective clinical, procedural and outcome data on the latter 21 patients was collected and is presented. Results: 21 patients, median age 1.72 years (range 0. 4-16.2) , underwent 42 procedures with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or stenting. 37 procedures were for PV stenosis and 5 for PV thrombosis. Treatment was with primary PTA, with stenting reserved C RSE for suboptimal PTA result or restenosis <3 months. 28 procedures were performed with PTA and 13 with stenting. Median trans-stenotic pressure gradients of 10 mmHg (range and 2mmHg (range 0-10) were measured pre and post intervention respectively. Technical success (>50% reduction in mean pressure gradient or absolute pressure gradient \u22644mmHg) was achieved in 41 procedures. Failure to recanalise a thrombosed PV occurred in 1 procedure. There were no major procedural complications. Patients were followed up with serial Doppler ultrasound surveillance. Kaplan-Meier estimated median primary patency was 9.9 months, with primary assisted patency of 95% after median follow-up of 45.3 months (range 6.5-171.6). Conclusion: With on-going surveillance, excellent patency rates can be achieved following percutaneous intervention for portal vein stenosis/thrombosis post paediatric liver transplantation.",

Material and methods: Eighteen patients underwent percutaneous endoportal RF treatment attempts. The PV tributary was accessed under US guidance; manipulation by a 5-Fr-diameter guiding catheter was used to conduct the guidewire across the blocked segment and portography was performed. Fifteen watts power was applied for 2 minutes using a bipolar endoluminal RF device (Habib\u2122 EndoHPB, EMcision Ltd., London, UK) placed in the blocked PV segment with the guidewire. The number of RF application sessions depends on the tumour thrombus extent as shown on portography. After RF application, a self-expanding 14-mm-diameter vascular stent was positioned, and PV patency restoration was documented by final portography. The procedure was completed by procedure track RF ablation and/or coil embolisation. Results: The procedure was completed in 13 (72.2%) cases; in 3 (16.7%) cases, we could not conduct the wire across the thrombus and in 2 (1.1%) cases, we could not conduct the RF device and the procedure was completed by stenting. The portal vein obstructed segment showed restored blood flow in all completed cases as documented by postprocedural portography, follow-up Doppler, and CT studies; this resulted in liver function improvement in 8 (61.5%) cases of the 13 cases with procedure technical success. Recanalised PV patency varied from 3 weeks to 22 months; 4 cases underwent successful TACE procedure after PV recanalization. Conclusion: PV thrombus percutaneous recanalisation by endoportal RFA with subsequent stenting is an effective technique and should be suggested as a possible treatment option for patients with HCC and PVT.",

Preserving the function of the embolized liver is crucial when contralateral hypertrophy fails or when the patient cannot be operated on. An ethylene-vinyl alcohol-copolymer (EVOH) liquid embolic has not been deeply studied for this indication. The preliminary histological findings after PV embolization with EVOH are shown. Material and methods: Histopathological analysis was performed on 12 right hepatectomies that had previously been embolized with EVOH 5 to 8 weeks before. A mean of 25.3 ml (range 13-36) of EVOH was used to fully occlude the right portal branches. Pre-and postembolization PV hemodynamic studies were performed. Results: Macroscopic occlusions in portal branches were complete without recanalization. Embolus consisted of black material surrounded by a reparative foreign body reaction composed of multinuclear giant cells without an acute inflammatory component. Microscopically, the embolic material systematically entered into the portal spaces. There was no disruption of the venous wall or migration of EVOH into the portal space or into hepatic parenchyma. No areas of cytolysis or regenerative phenomena were found in the liver tissue. Mean pre-and immediately postembolization PV pressure were 11 mmHg and 15.4 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: EVOH causes deep, extensive, and irreversible occlusions both on macro-and microscopic analysis. No cytolytic or regenerative phenomena have been identified. EVOH deposits and fibroinflammatory changes were limited to the occluded lumens and walls of either macro-or microscopic PV. Purpose: For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), ablation through irreversible electroporation (IRE) may offer a novel therapeutic option. IRE induces apoptosis of tumor cells by creating nanopores through high-voltage electric pulses. This leaves much of the vasculature intact, allowing for effective immune infiltration. We investigated the induction of systemic antitumor immunity following IRE treatment in an immune monitoring pilot study. Material and methods: In the first ten patients enrolled in a clinical trial exploring the safety and efficacy of percutaneous imageguided IRE in LAPC (the PANFIRE study), flow cytometric analysis was SS/FC/HL/HTS/CM CIRSE 2016 S133 Free Papers / News on Stage performed to determine the frequency and activation state of various lymphocytic and myeloid subsets in pre-and post-treatment peripheral blood samples. Systemic T cell responses to the pancreatic cancer-specific antigens mesothelin and Wilms Tumor (WT)-1 were determined after in vitro stimulation at baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months after IRE. Results: A transient decrease in systemic regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies and a simultaneous transient increase in activated T cells was found, consistent with the temporary lifting of Treg-imposed immune suppression after the IRE procedure. In addition, we found post-IRE boosting of a pre-existing WT-1-specific T cell response in two out of three patients as well as the de novo induction of these responses in another two patients. There was a trend pertaining to these WT-1 T cell responses being related to a longer overall survival (p=0.055). Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with a systemic immune stimulatory effect of IRE and support the combination of percutaneous IRE with therapeutic immune stimulation.",

Vietti-Violi 1 , R. Duran 1 , B. Guiu 2 , C. Aub\u00e9 3 Purpose: We performed the first prospective randomized multicentric study comparing the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) in terms of local tumor progression and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <4cm with chronic liver disease. Material and methods: From 2011 to 2015, we prospectively randomized patients with HCC with \u22643 lesions of \u22644cm non-surgical candidates. Our final groups consisted of group RFA (n=73, 15% female, 73% Child-Pugh A, 104 lesions treated) and group MWA (n=71, 17% female, 80% Child-Pugh A, 98 lesions treated). The primary outcome was rate of local tumor progression (LTP) at 1 year in the intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to progression (TTP), incomplete treatment rate, safety, and survival time. Results: We found no difference in LTP at 1 year of follow-up (RFA: LTP 2.8%; MWA: 5%, p=0.65) and at more than 20 months of followup (RFA: LTP 8.6%; MWA: 7.1%, p=0.98). Mean TTP was not different [RFA 15 months (SD: 7) and MWA 12 months (SD: 8); p=0.48]. This was confirmed by competiting risk and inverse probability of censoring weighting analyses accounting for transplantation or death. Rate of incomplete treatment after one session of thermoablation was similar (4% and 5%, respectively; p=0.93). No major complication occurred. Two grade 4 complications (SIR classification) occurred, both in MWA group. Rate of survival at 20 months was 88.5% and 88.8%, respectively (p=0.88). Conclusion: In a prospective randomized study with patients with HCC eligible for thermoablative treatment, we found no difference in local tumor progression and survival at more than 20 months of follow-up for lesions treated by RFA or MWA.",

Barabasch Purpose: To systematically investigate local and systemic effects of transpulmonary chemoembolization (TPCE) with degradable starch microspheres (DSM) and doxorubicin. The long-term goal was to establish DSM-TPCE as a treatment option for pulmonary malignancies. Material and methods: Nine pigs underwent TPCE via a catheter placed in the right or left lower lobe pulmonary artery (LLPA) and bland embolization (TPE) of the contralateral LLPA . Pulmonary arterial pressure, heart rate, and oxygenation were recorded immediately before and at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after treatment. To investigate possible non-target embolization, animals underwent cerebral MRI. Animals were sacrificed after a contrast-enhanced chest CT for pathologic examination 12 (3), 24 (3), and 72 hours (3) after treatment. Results: Mean injected DSM dose until stasis was similar in TPCE and TPE (4.2\u00b11.4 vs. 4.5\u00b11.5 mL). Pulmonary arterial pressure increased significantly 3 minutes after treatment (TPE: 17\u00b15, before vs. 27\u00b17 mmHg, 3 minutes after the treatment and TPCE: 22\u00b16, before vs. 36\u00b18 mmHg, 3 minutes after the treatment). No systemic cardiovascular effects, i.e., no change in heart rate or oxygenation prevs. post-TPCE or TPE were observed. No evidence of structural lung damage or permanent perfusion obstruction was observed on contrast-enhanced CT. No non-target embolization was found on cerebral MRI. Pathologic assessment revealed nonspecific local inflammation of the lung parenchyma, with increasing degree from 12 to 72 hours after treatment. Conclusion: In this large-animal modal, TPCE and TPE appear to be feasible and safe. Only a clinical, asymptomatic, mild increase in pulmonary arterial pressure was observed. Non-target embolization to the brain did not occur. TPCE as well as TPE did not cause significant damage to the normal lung parenchyma.",

The FRL function is probably a better endpoint than the FRL volume for deciding if resection needs to be performed and can be calculated by 99m Tc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS). The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of extended liver venous deprivation (eLVD), i.e. combination of right PVE and right and middle hepatic vein embolisation before major hepatectomy for FRL functional increase. Material and methods: eLVD was performed in patients without cirrhosis referred for major hepatectomy in the context of small FRL (baseline FRL<25% of the total liver volume or FRL function<2.69%/ min/m 2 ).

Material and methods: The arterial closure experiments were performed in 2 pigs, one acutely and one with a 7-day follow-up. A microcatheter compatible guidewire with an RF active tip was navigated under fluoroscopic guidance to 12 (acute) and 13 (7-day follow-up) arteries located in the thigh, liver, and left kidney. Inclusion criteria were arteries with an inner diameter of 1.5-2.5 mm. The animals' activated clotting time was kept between 140 and 170 seconds with intravenous heparin administration. Energy was applied at increasing power levels up to 40 W for a variable time up to 60 seconds until an electrical impedance change was observed, indicating vessel occlusion. The RFE wire was then retracted and occlusion was evaluated by digital subtracted arteriogram (DSA). For the 7-day survival animal study, the patency of the target arteries was analyzed by DSA. Results: Of the 25 targets, 23 were successfully occluded and one of the remaining two targets was a trifurcating vessel. The inner diameter mean size of the treated arteries was 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 mm. The activation time was 64 \u00b1 32 seconds including the four vessels requiring double treatment. No acute complication, such as vessel rupture/ distal embolization, was detected angiographically. Of the 13 vessels treated in the survival study, 10 remained occluded at 7 days. Conclusion: In this animal model, the use of the RFE wire seems to be safe and efficacious in the selective embolization of the small thigh, liver, and kidney arteries.",

Material and methods: This retrospective study included four patients who underwent embolization of IIA prior to endovascular aortic repair (three patients) and IIA aneurysm (one patient). In all cases, AVPI was deployed through a guiding sheath in IIA without detaching of AVPI from a delivery wire to stabilize the guiding sheath in IIA. Then, a microcatheter was advanced through the same guiding sheath coaxially into IIA. Finally, additional microcoil embolization around and proximal to AVPI was performed. Results: AVP-AT was successful in all cases. Because the guiding sheath was stabilized in the proximal portion of IIA by the delivery wire, microcoils were able to be packed tightly around and proximal to AVPI. Conclusion: AVP-AT stabilized a guiding sheath and enabled the deployment of micorcoils tightly in the proximal portion of IIA precisely. Purpose: To compare CT visibility of different types of embolic materials with particular deep penetration into the liver. Material and methods: Twelve pigs underwent embolization of a liver lobe: iodized oil (n=2; I), 40-\u03bcm standard bead suspended in normal saline (n=2; II), 40-\u03bcm visible bead suspended in normal saline (n=2; III), iodized oil (n=2; IV), 40-\u03bcm visible bead suspended in normal saline/iodinated contrast material (n=2; V), or 40-\u03bcm visible bead suspended in normal saline/iodinated contrast material/ heparin (n=2; VI). Animals were sacrificed 1 hour (I-III) or 1 week (IV-VI) after embolization. CT was performed before sacrifice (I-VI) and also after embolization (IV-VI). Study endpoints included X-ray visibility on CT and acute/sub-acute tissue reactions on histopathology studies. Results: CT visibility with linear and patchy contrast within the embolized liver lobe was demonstrated for I/III/IV/V/VI. For II, there was no CT visibility. The degree of CT visibility was higher for I/ IV than for III/V/VI. During follow-up, CT visibility decreased in the sub-acute groups (IV-VI).

Material and methods: IRE was performed in a gelatin tissue phantom and in potato tubers using continuous vs. sequential pulsing protocols (10-90 vs. 10-30-30-30) . Temperature was measured using fiber-optic probes. After temperature returned to baseline, 100 additional pulses were delivered. Seven patients, with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM; COLDFIRE-2 trial: NCT02082782), received 10 additional pulses for 1 electrode pair after a 10-minute cool-down period. Primary efficacy rate of 30 CRLM patients was compared to the mean conductivity-rise. Results: In both mediums the temperature-and conductivity-rise was higher for the continuous pulsing protocol (means: gel 13.05 vs. 9.55\u00b0C and 9A vs. 7A; potato 12.70 vs. 10.53\u00b0C and 6.0A vs. 6.5A). After cooling-down, conductivity returned to baseline in the gel phantom and nearly to baseline in the potato. The current of the first pulse was higher in a gel phantom of 40 degrees Celsius, compared to a gel phantom of 20 degrees Celsius. The conductivity also decreased after cooling-down (compared to the peak-amperage) in all 7 CRLM patients, although baseline values were not reached. There was a positive correlation found between conductivity-rise and efficacy (Pearson's r(2)=0.02).",

Although there is a correlation between conductivity-rise and efficacy the widespread adoption may have been premature, since this endpoint lacks clinical practicability and the cutoff value defining successful ablation is not applicable for all tumor types, leading to overtreatment and an increased risk of thermal damage. Purpose: To present and evaluate a new respiratory level biofeedback system that aids the patient in returning to a consistent level of breath-hold after image-guided interventions. Material and methods: The respiratory motion was recorded using a marker-less 3D depth camera mounted on a CT table. It measures the mean depth to the thorax and abdomen (d mean ) in realtime. After initial breath-hold, the system was calibrated, and subsequently, visual biofeedback was provided on a screen to the patient and radiologist as a ball moving up and down with respiration, with a stationary circle representing the initial level of breath-hold. Using spirometry, a conversion factor from d mean to relative lung volume (mL) was determined in 8 healthy volunteers in the supine and prone positions. Volunteers were given breathing instructions and asked to return to their initial level of breath-hold 10 times in both positions with and without visual biofeedback. For both positions, the mean deviation in lung volume from the initial breathhold and its standard deviation (SD) were determined with and without biofeedback using independent sample t-tests for comparison. Results: The mean deviations from initial breath-hold were 169\u00b1153mL and 234\u00b1194mL in the supine and prone positions, respectively, without the use of visual biofeedback. For all volunteers, this was decreased with the aid of biofeedback, with a mean of 42\u00b136mL (p<0.001) and 30\u00b125mL (p<0.001), respectively.",

Zumstein 2 1 Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, 2 Vascular Intervention, Biotronik, B\u00fclach, Switzerland Purpose: A self-expanding stent exerts a chronic outward force (COF) on the surrounding vessel wall. COF has been shown to trigger neointimal proliferation and restenosis in animal experiments when the stents were extremely oversized. In this study, stents with different expansion forces were implanted in swine with an average oversizing of 10%, which corresponds to clinically used values. Material and methods: Landrace Yorkshire swine (28-day group) and Yucatan minipigs (90-day group) were each implanted with 4 doublets of a high COF (LifeStent, Bard) and 4 doublets of a low COF (AstronPulsar, Biotronik) in the iliac or femoral artery. Diameter of the stent and vessel was 7 mm and 5.3 mm, respectively. On sections of the arteries with stents in place, the area inside the lamina elastica interna (IEL) and the area of the lumen were measured. The difference between these measurements corresponds to the area of the neointima. COF that the stent exerts on the vessel wall at a given stent diameter was measured in bench tests for every stent-type. Results: The mean COF of AstronPulsar and LifeStent were 0.06 and 0.11 N/mm, respectively. High-COF stents showed significantly more neointimal and IEL area at 28 and 90 days than low-COF stents and area stenosis tended to be higher. High-COF stents expanded during the observation time; consequently, there was higher absolute IEL in the high-COF group, which explains that the absolute lumen area remained similar between groups despite increased neointimal area in high-COF stents. Conclusion: Even with moderate oversizing, COF of self-expanding stents correlates with neointimal proliferation. Potentially, low-COF stents trigger less restenosis. ",

The presented data further elucidated the route of the drug to the target tissue and local pharmacological effects of an additive. Material and methods: Standard nylon angioplasty balloons were coated with paclitaxel plus the natural antioxidant resveratrol. Balloons were investigated for appearance, the precision of the dose, and drug loss during the in vitro simulated way to the lesion. In swine, the proportion of drug reaching the target vessel, the transfer to the vessel wall (HPLC analysis), inhibition of neointimal proliferation, and inhibition of inflammation by resveratrol were determined. Images of paclitaxel distribution were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI). Residual paclitaxel on used balloons was measured (HPLC). Results: Homogeneous white coating with precise dose (\u00b11%) was achieved. Loss on the way to the lesion was <5%. On inflated balloons in the iliac arteries, 65%\u00b113% of dose was retrieved, whereas after deflation, 7.1%\u00b16.1% of dose was found in the vessel wall. MALDI image showed circumferential distribution of paclitaxel in the vessel. Subsequently, retraction balloons contained 20%\u00b112% of dose. Inhibition of neointimal proliferation by paclitaxel and antiinflammatory effects of resveratrol were confirmed by histology. Conclusion: Balloons were successfully coated with paclitaxel/resveratrol matrix. Studies in swine indicate inhibition of neointima proliferation and potentially beneficial effects of resveratrol. A large proportion of paclitaxel is available during balloon inflation. Purpose: To assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of an irradiation biliary stent in the treatment of malignant hilar biliary obstruction. Material and methods: A total of eleven patients with malignant hilar biliary obstructions and symptomatic jaundice were consecutively recruited to receive the percutaneous placement of irradiation stent. The irradiation stent was designed as a double-layer stent consisting of an outer iodine-125 radioactive seed-loaded stent and an inner self-expandable metallic stent. The seed-loaded stent was first implanted and the self-expandable nitinol stent was immediately followed through the same guidewire and 10-F sheath. Technical success rate, complications, and time to recurrent biliary obstruction were evaluated. Successful stent placement was considered when the irradiation stent was deployed in the target position of the biliary tract with full expansion and complete overlap between the inner and outer stents.",

Purpose: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a biodegradable biliary stent in the treatment of benign strictures of the biliary tract by implanting ELLA-type stent using medium-and long-term follow-up of patients at a single center. Material and methods: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Aragon. Thirty-two patients (females, 48.4%; mean age, 61.45 \u00b1 13.64 years) were treated. The most frequent cause was surgical complications of the biliary branches and bile duct in 41.9% of patients. In all patients, ELLA-DV biliary stents, which were custom built with different sizes and lengths using polydioxanone for each patient, were implanted. Stent patency, clinical symptoms, relevant laboratory data, and complications were analyzed during follow-up. The mean follow-up period was 17.09 \u00b1 25.04 months. Results: Clinical success was 100%, and in only 1 patient, the stent migrated distally and could be replaced using an angioplasty balloon. The mean stent patency was 84.55 months (range, 60.29-108.80 months; 95% CI), and 70.96% of stents were patent. GGT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels decreased in 33.41%, 59.26%, and 16.01% of patients, respectively. The most common immediate complication was hemobilia (6.5%), which did not require complementary measures. Nine patients (29.03%) with restenosis or obstruction required new drainage and/or surgical intervention. Conclusion: The implantation of ELLA absorbable stents is feasible, safe, and effective for benign biliary strictures refractory to standard treatments. ",

We conducted a retrospective observational study on the cause of strictures and the reason for SX-ELLA placement and a descriptive comparison of the clinical evolution and stricture recurrence between patients with and without SX-ELLA placement using clinical, analytical and radiological parameters. Results: Twenty-three patients (11 males and 22 females; mean age 6.2 years); group A (n=10) treated with bilioplasty, drainage catheters and permanent stents and group B (n=13) treated with additional placement of SX-ELLA.

Material and methods: Endoluminal IRE of the common bile duct (CBD) was performed on 20 porcine models using an endoluminal device inserted during laparotomy. The IRE device consists of 3 electrodes that are 1 cm in length, attached at 120\u00b0 around the expander. The procedure was conducted with the following parameters: number of pulses 50-90 and a voltage of 1200-2000 V between each couple of electrodes. All pigs were euthanized 1-22 days after the procedure. Both MRI and histopathological evaluations were employed for follow-up. Results: The IRE treatment was successful in all porcine models. All animals survived over the defined study period. Peri-ablation edema within the hepatoduodenal ligament and adjacent liver tissue measured from 2.5-42.0 ml on post-procedural volumetric MRI analysis on day 0. Edema showed a tendency of diminishing on imaging studies over the follow-up period by 7%-27% per day. The measured depth of necrosis on histopathological specimens ranged between 3 and 6 mm. Perforation of CBD and hematoma of the hepatoduodenal ligament developed in two models with an applied electric field strength of more than 1800V/cm. One coincidental case CIRSE Abstract Book S140 CIRSE C RSE of partial deficiency of elastin fibres in CBD did not lead to the development of clinically significant perforation. Conclusion: This novel endoluminal modality used within the perihilar region on porcine models is a feasible and well predictable procedure according to our experience. The safety of the method depends on selecting the ablation protocol with optimal parameters, primarily the electric field strength.",

All patients were selected according to our hospital's indication criteria for occluded metal biliary stent recanalisation. The stent recanalisation was performed under fluoroscopic control with radiofrequency ablation catheter EndoHPB 8F connected to the generator 1500X RF using a monopolar approach. The effect of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of occluded metal biliary stents was evaluated by biliary tract fluoroscopy. Enrolled patients were prospectively followed-up. Results: In all 11 cases, radiofrequency ablation using the monopolar approach was successful for stent recanalisation. The average period of stent patency before recanalisation was 6.9 months (3-12, median 5.5 months) and stent patency after recanalisation was an additional 4.8 months (1.5-12, median 5 months). Eight of 11 patients died during the follow-up within an average of 15 months (9.5-25, median 12 months) after stent placement, respectively, in 15.3 months (Kaplan-Meier analysis). No complications were observed during and after the procedure. Three patients are still alive; two of them surviving for 10 months and one surviving for 25 months after stent placement. Conclusion: The monopolar approach for using the endoluminal radiofrequency catheter for occluded metal biliary stent recanalisation seems to be a precise and efficient technique for treating tissue ingrowth. However, the natural course of oncological disease and disadvantages of the catheter-based technique for recanalisation may lead to early procedural failure.

The cohort included 14 women with non-tubal ectopic pregnancy and positive fetal cardiac activity. Mean maternal age was 36.2\u00b16.2 years. Non-tubal ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed based on the location: 5 (36%) cervical, 6 (43%) interstitial/cornual, and 3 (21%) cesarean scar. Mean gestational age was 78.2\u00b119 days with beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) levels ranging from 2932 to 61596 IU/L (mean 18400 IU/L). Treatment success was determined by cessation of cardiac activity, drop of serum \u03b2-hCG levels by at least 15% within the hospitalization period, and undetectable serum \u03b2-hCG levels within the follow-up period. Results: Treatment was successful in 13/14 (93%) cases with \u03b2-hCG returning to undetectable levels within 14-147 days (mean 54.5 days). In one woman with cervical pregnancy, fetal cardiac activity remained 2 days after protocol completion. Only mild adverse events (SIR class A and B) were observed. Among 8 women who stated that they were interested in becoming pregnant, 6 (75%) had a subsequent pregnancy, although 2 (30%) had spontaneous abortions. Conclusion: Intra-arterial MTX followed by temporary bilateral uterine artery embolization combined with systemic MTX treatment is a safe, effective, and presumably fertility preserving technique in the management of advanced non-tubal ectopic pregnancy with positive fetal cardiac activity.",

Material and methods: Fifty patients with diagnosed placental implant anomalies at 35-36 weeks of pregnancy were treated. Superselective UAE by injecting reabsorbable pledgets immediately before the delivery was performed in the gynecological operating room using a mobile arch and according to CIRSE guidelines for the SS/FC/HL/HTS/CM CIRSE 2016 S141 Free Papers / News on Stage use of radiation during pregnancy. Five dosimeters were applied to patients' backs for measuring the uterine radiation dose, which was considered to be the same radiation dose that the fetus received. Newborns' conditions were assessed immediately after birth and at the 6-month follow-up. Uterine conditions were monitored at the 6-12-month follow-up by MR imaging. Results: All procedures were technically successful. Overall, 64% of patients did not require transfusions. Mean blood units transfused was 0.7 U. No patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Hysterectomy was performed in 26% patients. Mean uterine radiation dose was 15.61 mGy. One-and five-minute Apgar scores were 8-9 in all newborns. Eight newborns were lost to follow-up; normal cognitive outcome was evident in all 42 children studied at 6 months. In the 10 patients recruited for pelvic MR follow-up at 6-12 months, no uterine necrotic area was detected and the vascularization of the uterine wall was preserved. Conclusion: UAE before delivery appeared to be a safe approach to reduce bleeding during cesarean sections in this sample of patients with placental implant anomalies. Radiation dose to the fetus was minimal. Uterus vascularization was preserved at the MR follow-up.",

Material and methods: Twenty-one patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study to be treated with percutaneous robot-assisted embolization using the Magellan system. Fourteen patients were treated using a first generation steerable robotic catheter, version 1.0 (group 1) and seven were treated using the new version 1.1 (group 2). Demographic, pathologic, and procedural variables were recorded. Dose area product (DAP) and effective physician doses were registered for each procedure. Procedure-related complications and clinical midterm outcomes were also evaluated. Results: Successful robot-assisted UFE was obtained in 8 patients (57.1%) in group 1 and 7 patients (100%) in group 2 (p=0.01). A successful robot-assisted catheterization of the internal iliac artery anterior branch was performed in all patients of both groups. The median selective target vessel catherization time was 21.0\u00b112.8min vs 13.4\u00b17min (p=0.04) and the total fluoroscopy time was 30.3\u00b111.2min vs 19.3\u00b15.9min, respectively, in groups 1 and 2. The mean DAP decreased from 18472.6\u00b115622cGy.cm\u00b2 to 5469.1\u00b14461.0 cGy.cm\u00b2 (p=0.04). All patients obtained symptom relief at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: Robot-assisted UFE is safe and effective. A new version of the steerable robotic catheter facilitates a faster procedure without related adverse events compared with the old version.",

The patient's postprocedural course was uneventful in all cases, with hospital discharge within 2 days. One patient required reintervention by thrombectomy using the Aspirex \u00ae S catheter within 1 month for early in-stent rethrombosis. Follow-up was continued for a mean of 7 months. All patients were asymptomatic with no sequelae. Secondary stent patency was 100% as assessed by Doppler ultrasound and CT. Conclusion: PMT using the Aspirex \u00ae S catheter is a safe, fast, and effective therapeutic option in patients with acute symptomatic iliofemoral DVT. Purpose: To report our single-center experience with the use of endovascular treatment for chronic post-thrombotic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions. Material and methods: A prospective single-center observational cohort study of patients with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and chronic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions referred for endovascular treatment was conducted from March 2012 to April 2016. The procedure included recanalization, pre-dilation, and self-expandable stenting of stenotic or occluded iliac and/ or femoral veins. The severity of PTS, quality of life, and treatment outcomes were assessed using Villalta scale and Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20) at baseline and 3 months after the procedure. Results: Twenty-one patients (11 females, 10 males; median age, 41 years; range, 32-60 years) were included. Recanalization and stenting was successfully accomplished in all prime procedures. The immediate technical success rate was 96% considering 25 procedures that were performed without any complications. The median follow-up was 18 months (range, 6-30 months) with a 90.5% stent patency rate. The Villalta score significantly decreased from the baseline at 3 months after the procedure [14 (range, 11-22) and 5 (range, 1-10), respectively, P<0.0001], showing a significant decrease in the severity of PTS. The CIVIQ-20 score significantly decreased from the baseline at 3 months after the procedure [48.5 (range, 39-73) and 26.5 (range, 21-45) , respectively, P<0.0001], thus showing a significant improvement in quality of life. Conclusion: Our results confirm the high clinical success rate and safety of endovascular PTS treatment and highlight the significant impact of stenting on the quality of life of patients with chronic postthrombotic symptomatic ilio-femoral venous obstructive lesions.",

In animals and humans, high COF has been linked to neointimal hyperplasia and lumen loss. The BIOFLEX-COF study is the first randomized study to address the influence of COF on neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis. Material and methods: De novo SFA lesions were treated with nitinol stent implantation. Eighty patients were randomized into high and low COF groups. Stent diameters were chosen after measuring the SFA diameter according to a pre-defined sizing table. To obtain low COF, a soft stent (Pulsar, Biotronic) was implanted with little oversizing. To obtain high COF, a harder stent (Lifestent, Bard) was implanted with ample oversizing. Between the two groups, a 2-3\u00d7 difference in absolute COF is expected. The outcome parameter is the volume of the in-stent-neointima measured by CT angiography 1 and 2 years after the implantation. Results: A total of 50 patients have been recruited and undergone stent implantation. The technical success rate was 100%, and no major complications occurred.

            "text": "Purpose: To review the rationale and data supporting 2 nd generation low dose DCB. Material and methods: Modern DCBs utilize several technical components to exert their mode of action including differing drug formulations, drug doses, excipients, and coating methodologies. Stellarex is a low dose (2 ug/mm2) DCB with a hybrid paclitaxel formulation and a unique Polyethylene Glycol excipient (PEG). Lowering drug dose represents a design goal of modern DCBs in that, when combined with high transfer efficiency, limits potential drug embolization. The Stellarex DCB hybrid drug formulation balances crystalline and amorphous paclitaxel to combine sustained and prompt drug release and increase coating uniformity and integrity particularly in the dry state. Polyethylene Glycol, due to its high molecular weight (8000 g/mol) confers superior mechanical properties and high coating adaptability to balloon deformations. In addition, PEG operates as a slow dissolving carrier thus limiting drug dispersion during balloon tracking in the bloodstream and offering sustained release while in tissue. Finally PEG affinity to hydroxyl apatite (the primary component of calcified atherosclerotic lesions) may confer limited wash out in presence of calcium. Results: Bench and preclinical evidence with the Stellarex DCB demonstrate high transfer efficiency translating into a desired drug tissue uptake and retention at 30 days and limited drug loss compared to alternative DCB technologies with higher drug doses. Level 1 evidence from 2 randomized trials and 628 patients with common to complex profiles support these findings with highest reported 1-year primary patency of 89%. Conclusion: Stellarex is a clinically proven, 2 nd generation, low dose, drug coated balloon. Purpose: Radioembolization of liver tumors is not a uniform therapy, many choices need to be made from planning treatment until follow-up with a lot of variation between centers. In addition, there have been several developments in the field of radioembolization over the last decade, that seem not to have found their way into routine practice everywhere. We conducted a survey among CIRSE members to investigate how radioembolization is performed across Europe. Material and methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 25 questions was distributed among all members of the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology Society of Europe (CIRSE). The questions were in part based on a European survey performed in 2011 (Powerski et al, Eur J Radiol 2012) and were divided into the following categories: 1) patient work-up, 2) patient treatment, 3) patient aftercare, and 4) future developments.

This trial is ongoing up to 2 years follow-up and given the propensity for recurrence of stenosis in AVF, late results are of considerable interest. Material and methods: 285 patients with failing AVF at 23 centers were enrolled in this randomized trial. All patients received vessel preparation (high pressure PTA) of the lesion responsible for access dysfunction; a secondary lesion was allowed. After successful (<30% residual stenosis) PTA, either a paclitaxel-coated balloon (DCB) or an uncoated control balloon (C) of similar semi-compliant design was deployed at the treatment site. The treatment and control balloons were the same diameter as the pre-treatment balloon. Central venous and stent-associated stenoses were excluded. Follow-up was clinically driven; no scheduled US or fistulography was performed. Endpoints included 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 month target lesion primary patency (TLPP), number of interventions required to maintain target lesion patency, and safety endpoints. Results: Lesion location, access type and other demographic variables did not differ between groups. The 30-day safety endpoint was met (P<0.001). Interim 18 month results will be reported.",

This study investigates a real-time radiation dosimetry system (RTRS) during vertebral augmentation, including its effects on radiation exposure and implementation of radiation safety measures. Material and methods: RTRS (Ray safe I2) measured real-time radiation exposure in mREM (mR) for the attending physician (IR), scrub technologist (SC), circulating technologist (CT), and anesthesiologist (A). Fluoroscopy time (FT), dose area product (DAP), and mR were displayed for staff during the procedure. Data during standard procedure (SP) (n=10) were collected. Radiation reducing measures were added in the radiation-reduced procedure group (RRP) (n=55) and monitored with RTRS. Results: Patients' weight was higher in RRP (72 vs 67 kg) compared with that in SP. Steps to reduce mR included the following: -increasing staff awareness due to RTRS in a room, -using low-pulse fluoroscopy (3f/s), -angulation of image intensifier toward IR, -wearing protective glass lead shield for IR and A, -purposefully increasing distance to the radiation source, SS/FC/HL/HTS/CM CIRSE 2016 S147 Free Papers / News on Stage -placing a radiation-absorbing shield on patients, and -eliminatiing post-procedure cone-beam CT. Radiation exposure data Exposure of SC using cone-beam CT increased mR by 5-fold. Conclusion: Utilization of RTRS significantly reduced staff radiation exposure during vertebral augmentation. This new procedure algorithm incorporates increased radiation awareness, stringent use of radiation protective devices, and implementation of a revised workflow.

The impact on image quality as related to neurointerventional procedures is currently in progress. Purpose: Interventional radiologists are exposed to scatter radiation during X-ray-guided procedures. Although the body and thyroid are usually protected by a customized apron, most interventional radiologists do not wear head protection caps. Occupational head exposure to radiation may cause radiation-induced cataracts and an increased risk of brain neoplasia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the X-ray protection effect of X-ray attenuating head caps with and without lead glasses. Material and methods: Phantom measurements mimicking a clinical setting for an interventional radiologist were performed. X-ray exposure of the phantom head (Rando-man) with and without a 0.35-mm lead-equivalent head protection cap with and without lead glasses was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD-100s) attached above and under the cap and glasses at predefined landmarks. Additionally, the X-ray protection effect was measured in two clinical procedures. Results: We present the results from our phantom study and interim data from our ongoing prospective clinical analysis. In phantom measurements, the X-ray exposure reduction at the frontal head and left parietal lobe were a factor of 4.7\u00b10.3 and 3.8\u00b10.6, respectively, for the lead cap and a factor of 5.1\u00b10.2 and 2.2\u00b10.7, respectively, for the cap and glasses. These results were paralleled in the clinical setting (frontal head reduction factor of 2.5-6.0 and left parietal lobe reduction factor of 1.3-2.1). In contrast, an exposure increase was observed in the right parietal lobe (reduction factor of 0.4-0.6).",

Material and methods: Between July 2015 and December 2016, we performed 26 CT-guided percutaneous biopsies in 26 patients (16 lung biopsy and 10 renal biopsy). Thirteen biopsies (8 lung and 5 renal) were performed using the \"freehand\" standard technique, whereas 13 procedures (8 lung and 5 renal) were performed using the robotic tracking system. For both procedures, the final positioning of the needle was confirmed with fluoro-CT. The parameters for CT were as follows: 125mAs and slice thickness of 2mm. Results: Fluoro-CT confirmed the correct position of the needle using the robotic tracking system with a single entry in 12/13 (92%) patients. Technical success for both procedures was 100%. The mean execution time was 10 minutes for the assisted procedure and 16 minutes for the \"freehand\" procedure. The mean radiation dose for the patients after the first CT used for the visualization of the lesion was 2.5mSv in the standard procedure and 0.56mSv in the procedure using the robotic tracking system. The radiation dose for IRs was 0. Conclusion: The robotic tracking system is an innovative medical device that allows centering lesions with an high degree of accuracy and following needle trajectory in real-time to avoid sensitive structures. Furthermore, reducing the procedure time and number of CTs facilitates reduction in the radiation dose in the patients and IRs. were included in an extended-use group.

Percutaneous treatment of calcified iliac stenosis is associated with high rates of complications including dissection and perforation which require urgent percutaneous or surgical intervention and associated comorbidities. Lithoplasty is a novel balloon-based therapy utilizing lithotripsy specifically designed to disrupt calcium prior to low-pressure balloon expansion. This study aimed to investigate the safety and performance of the peripheral lithoplasty catheter system (Shockwave Medical, Fremont CA), a lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon catheter, for the treatment of calcified, stenotic, iliac arteries. Material and methods: This is a prospective, single-center, singlearm study of 10 patients with calcified iliac artery disease. Patients will be screened for severely calcified iliac arteries (stenosis > 50%) using CTA. Patients will undergo procedural angiography and intravascular imaging at baseline and following lithoplasty. The primary safety endpoint is major adverse events through 30 days including death, target limb loss, or target limb revascularization. The primary performance endpoint is acute reduction in percent diameter stenosis of the target lesion. Results: Baseline and 30-day results will be available at the time of presentation.

The purpose of the helical centreline geometry is to generate swirling blood flow within the stented segment. Preclinical studies have indicated that the introduction of swirling blood flow reduces neointimal formation. This clinical study aimed to answer the question whether non-planar curvature can be imparted to a diseased, calcified artery and whether this leads to a swirling flow. Material and methods: The Mimics study randomized 76 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease: 2:1 to either BioMimics 3D or Lifestent. In the helical and straight stent groups, 52% (26/50) and 58% (15/26) (P=0.47), respectively, had moderate-severe calcification (core lab data). Using biplanar X-ray images (AP and lateral projections), the stent centreline curvature was quantified for each device. The presence or otherwise of swirling flow within the stents was confirmed by transluminal color Doppler. Results: For lesions with none-mild calcium burden, there is a significant increase in stent curvature when the BioMimics 3D and control stents are compared (P=0.05) and there is no drop-off in the level of curvature in the BioMimics 3D device when the none-mild and moderate-severe groups are compared (P=0.14). Primary patency was observed to be independent of the degree of calcification in the BioMimics 3D group. This supports the rationale for BioMimics 3D use within heavily diseased femoropopliteal segments.",

Purpose: To present the percutaneous procedures that might be performed after pancreatic duct (PD) percutaneous drainage. Material and methods: Twenty-one patients underwent imageguided percutaneous procedures via the PD percutaneous drainage tract, including endoluminal RFA with subsequent stenting in 9, balloon-assisted percutaneous descending litholapaxy (BAPDL) in 6, endoluminal biopsy in 3, balloon dilatation in 2, and stenting in 1 patient. The obligatory first step for all procedures was conduction of the wire into the duodenum performed using a 5-Fr-diameter Advantage catheter. RFA was performed using a 5-Fr-diameter novel bipolar RF device (15 watts of energy applied for 2 minutes), positioned in the strictured segment over the wire and BAPDL was performed by pushing down action using a partially inflated balloon after papilla dilatation. Endoluminal biopsy was performed using a endobiliary forceps biopsy set. Balloon dilatation and stenting was performed using the conventional technique. Results: In 18 (85.7%) of 21 cases, the procedures were completed, achieving PD patency restoration or adequate tissue sample; in 3 (14.3%) cases (all pancreatic head cancers), procedure completion was impossible because of failure of guidewire conduction across the strictured segment of PD. All patients tolerated the procedure well and there was no 30-day or hospital mortality; no technique specific complications were observed. Conclusion: Percutaneous fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous diagnostic and treatment procedures via the PD percutaneous drainage tract are safe and effective; these procedures should be routinely suggested as treatment options for selected patients.",

This procedure was safe with no major complications and associated with significant improvement in the dysphagia score and satisfactory long-term reintervention rates. Material and methods: AVF were surgically created in the right groin of Wistar rats (n=10), while sham procedures were performed in the contralateral (left) groin of each rat. Following intravascular administration of the fluorescent probe, near-infrared imaging was performed both in vivo as well as ex vivo in AVF-and sham-treated animals. Histologic analyses of AVF-and sham-treated vessels were performed to corroborate imaging findings. Results: AVF were successfully created in all animals at the time of surgery. Fistulography confirmed AVF with >50% peri-anastomotic stenosis in all animals imaged 4 weeks post-AVF creation (n=5). In two animals, AVFs were thrombosed at 4 weeks post-AVF creation. The mean normalized MMP-activated NIRF signal was 45.5 in AVFs compared with 16.2 in the contralateral control vessels. The mean increase in total radiant efficiency of AVFs over the control vessels was 2.6-fold (SD=0.98, p=0.012). Increased levels of MMP-2 were identified in the neointimal layer of the peri-anastomotic venous stenosis. On average, the thickness of intimal staining for MMP-2 measured 171.3\u00b158.9 compared with 70.4\u00b134 in sham vessels (p=0.0072). Conclusion: NIRF imaging can detect increased MMP-2 activity in stenotic AVF compared with contralateral normal vessels. This finding was confirmed by an increase in the MMP-2 signal in the neointimal layer of stenotic AVF. These findings indicate that NIRF imaging of MMP-2 may be used as a biomarker for the vascular remodeling of the underlying stenosis.",

Toxicity evaluation was based on the comparison of pre-and post-procedural laboratory tests (with a cut-off of 50% of increase); the onset of major or minor complications was recorded. Results: In 19 patients, the score was 0 (no non-target sub-segmental artery embolization), whereas in 30 patients who underwent TACE, the score was 1 (one non-target sub-segmental artery embolization). At 1-month follow-up, complete response was observed in",

Material and methods: This was a prospective, multi-center, singlearm study involving 20 patients with calcified infrapopliteal artery disease. The primary safety endpoint was major adverse events, including death, myocardial infarction, emergency revascularization, or target limb amputation, over 30 days. The primary performance endpoint was acute reduction in the percent diameter stenosis of the target lesion, as assessed by angiographic core lab. The secondary endpoint was the ability of the Peripheral Lithoplasty Catheter System to achieve residual stenosis of <50%. Results: Baseline and 30-day results will be available at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Lithoplasty is a novel therapy for treating calcified peripheral artery lesions.

Randomly and sequentially, all patients underwent at least two interventions: 1 transradial and 1 transfemoral. If a third one was needed, the patient selected the access type. The primary endpoint was patient access preference, and secondary endpoints were access-related complications. All patients were assessed next day and at 30 days post-intervention. Assessment included a questionnaire and physical exam followed by ultrasound. Results: Fifty-five patients with liver cancer (31 hepatocellular carcinoma and 24 metastatic disease) were initially randomly assigned to radial or femoral access.

Goffette Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel endovascular device designed to treat bifurcation intracranial aneurysms with very wide necks. Material and methods: Over an 18-month period, we used the Pulserider device (Codman) for stent-assisted coiling in 7 patients (4F and 3M, mean age 53 years) presenting with a extremely broadbased unruptured cerebral aneurysm (median dome size 6.4 mm and median neck size 5.9 mm). The PulseRider device has a unique frame configuration specifically designed with concentrated coverage at the neck and open architecture in the branch vessels allowing preservation of the parent artery patency and flow through the bifurcation while securely retaining coils within the aneurysmal sac and minimizing exposed metal. Main advantages of this device are the lower risk of stent-induced platelet aggregation and ability to reposition even after complete deployment before detachment. Results: Optimal PulseRider deployment followed by complete aneurysm coiling was obtained in 6 patients. Detachment of the device at the end of the coiling was uneventful. Failure of PulseRider treatment occurred in one case due to angulation of the aneurysmal neck related to the parent vessel axis. No intraprocedural thromboembolic complication was observed. There was no mortality or permanent neurologic morbidity at discharge and at the 3-6 months follow-up. The immediate angiographic outcome showed 4 complete occlusions and 2 small neck remnants. Follow-up at 6 months demonstrated persistent complete occlusions in 3, stable remnants in 2, and growing neck in 1 patient. Conclusion: PulseRider stent-assisted coiling of wide-neck cerebral aneurysms is feasible with low procedural complication rate and promising initial results.",

Based on the sum of the scores, nodules were divided into three groups (G1: 0-1, G2: 2, G3: 3); significance was assessed using Wilcoxon test. Results: On the whole, 36/183 tumors (mean size 15 \u00b1 4 mm) were scored poorly (11/36) or were not visible (25/36) at ultrasound examination, 11/36 had CEUS positivity, and 13/36 showed anatomical landmarks. CA was obtained in 12/13 (92%) nodules in G1, 7/9 (78%) nodules in G2, and 3/14 nodules (21%) in G3. In G3, 4 cases were completely missed at the first attempt. CA was significantly better in G1-G2 than in G3 (p = 0.01); no statistical differences were found between G1-G2 and the group with good visibility (135/147 nodules, mean size 18 \u00b1 6 mm, CA 92%, p > 0.05). Conclusion: Fusion imaging is an effective tool to increase the number of ablated tumors; however, obtaining CA in completely invisible nodules with no anatomical landmarks still remains challenging. A feasibility score of >2 predicts poor technical results. Purpose: The endovascular approach evolved as a mainstay in the treatment of aortic aneurysms. Arterial access is a key parameter for success; the transfemoral approach is often inaccessible due to vascular pathologies such as vessel kinking or occlusion. The transapical access may be an alternative approach. The goal of this study is to report the feasibility of the transapical approach for the endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TEVAR). Material and methods: Three patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms with inaccessible femoral arteries (2 \u00d7 chronic Leriche's syndrome, 1 \u00d7 massive kinking) underwent TEVAR via the transapical approach. For access, the apex of the left ventricle was exposed by a minithoracotomy. After left ventricular puncture, a guidewire was placed through the aortic valve into the descending thoracic aorta. All stentgrafts were delivered under fluoroscopic guidance. Results: All three procedures were technically successful with complete exclusion of the aneurysm without endoleak. One patient suffered spinal ischemia with subsequent paraplegia on day 4 after the procedure. The same patient died on day 43 after the procedure due contrast-enhanced CTs, and MRIs were performed to detect disease progression. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for survival analysis. Results: IRE was successfully performed in all 30 patients (39 CRLMs).",

It is unknown to date if IRE causes degradation of the embolic agents or surgical clips. We aim to examine the 1) effects of IRE on the morphology of various embolic agents and 2) effects of these agents on the ablation field using a previously validated vegetal model, the potato tuber. Material and methods: Metallic surgical clips and various metallic and non-metallic embolic agents were inserted within the centre of the tuber ablation field using a needle guide. Additionally, surgical clips were inserted on the edge and outside the ablation field. One tuber without material was ablated as a control. Ablation settings were based on previously published experiments. Tubers were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 18-24 hours after ablation, and the dimensions of the ablated fields were measured. Structure of the non-metallic embolic agents was examined microscopically by the pathologist. Results: Non-metallic agents did not affect the ablation pattern when compared with the control group. Metallic implants, however, did affect the ablation pattern compared with the control group. There was no microscopic physical alteration or degradation of all agents after IRE. Conclusion: IRE does not affect embolic agents or surgical clips in this experimental study, although there is alteration to the field pattern with metallic material. Further animal model experiments are warranted to confirm these findings.",

SF-36 observation showed that the best-scoring domain was \"role emotion,\" and \"vitality\" and \"mental health\" also scored well preoperatively. Except for \"role emotion\" and \"mental health,\" all remaining domains showed a significant improvement at both FU1 and FU2. Conclusion: Endovascular repair in patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection has excellent clinical outcomes and improves QoL; further research is required to assess whether this improvement in QOL persists over the long term. Results: In 95/139 patients who underwent TEVAR of the primary entry tear, an additional intervention was needed as part of the primary procedure (30-day period); thus, 61 stents or stent grafts (compromised visceral or peripheral artery perfusion), 23 embolizations (mostly coiling) of false lumen reperfusions, and 11 EVARs were performed. Thirty-day mortality rate in this subgroup was 7.9%, and that in the 44 patients who underwent TEVAR alone was 2.5%. No persistent paraplegia occurred in the entire cohort. One-year survival rate in the surviving patients was 81%. Among these surviving patients, further (secondary) interventions were required in 46% of patients at 1-year intervals and in 71% of patients at 5-year intervals. These interventions included additional TEVAR reaching the celiac trunk, EVAR, F-EVAR, and organ artery stenting for delayed malperfusion syndrome. The specific procedure-related mortality rate associated with these secondary interventions was 3.4%. Conclusion: Complicated TABD can be treated primarily by TEVAR alone in approximately one-third of the patients. Two-thirds of the patients require further interventions parallel to or directly related to the primary procedure. Thus, maintaining a strict surveillance program in all patients is mandatory for the early detection of delayed secondary complications, which then require further interventions. In a 5-year follow-up, this might be expected as high as 70%.",

However, because total arch replacement is extremely invasive, it can be difficult to perform in some patients. We designed an endovascular total arch repair procedure with the use of in situ fenestration, and we present our mid-term results. Material and methods: Twelve patients (chronic type A aortic dissection, n = 4 and aortic arch aneurysm, n = 8) who underwent endovascular total arch repair with the use of in situ fenestration TEVAR from a zone 0 landing were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass.

All patients had an acceptable postoperative course, with no 30-day and in-hospital deaths. One of the patient had endoleakage; however, all patients exhibited a reduction in the aneurysm diameter or thrombosed false lumen during a mean follow-up of 15 (2-41) months. Conclusion: Endovascular total arch repair with the use of in situ fenestration TEVAR is a valuable option for aortic arch aneurysm and chronic type A dissection with acceptable mid-term results. (61) for symptomatic type A aortic dissection. In total, 110 patients survived the operation, and they represent the cohort of this analysis. Results: During follow-up (median, 31 months), 36/110 survivors underwent 57 secondary interventions. The indication for these interventions was either a persistent or newly developed malperfusion syndrome (41) or a critically increasing false lumen diameter (16) . Twenty-one patients needed more than one intervention. In 31 patients, a persistent malperfusion syndrome resulted from inadequate reperfusion of the true lumen, which was treated with TEVAR. Eleven of these patients underwent additional visceral artery stenting. Ten patients presented a delayed malperfusion syndrome, which was mostly caused by secondary onset of organ failure or reduced perfusion of the legs and was accordingly treated with stentgrafts. Sixteen patients with late critical enlargement of the false lumen underwent TEVAR (11) or F-EVAR (5) (mean interval, 37 months). One patient developed incomplete paraplegia. Procedurerelated 30-day mortality rate was 1.8% (2/57). Conclusion: Type A aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency that requires open repair, which is associated with significant primary mortality. In approximately 1/3 of the survivors, further complex aortic or visceral side branch interventions are required to improve survival. Purpose: To report a single-centre long-term follow-up with custom-made endografts for thoraco-abdominal aneurysm and type B dissection. Material and methods: Between 2011 and 2016, 42 patients (71.6\u00b19.2 years; 12 females) were treated. The indications were Crawford aneurysm type 4 (n=21; 50%), type 3 (n=13; 30.9%), type 2 (n=4; 9.5%), and type 1 (n=2; 4.8%) and Standford type B dissection (n=2; 4.8%). All patients were unfit for open surgery. The mean aneurysm diameter was 58.5\u00b18.3 mm (range 50-78). The employed custom-made endografts were fenestrated (n=15; 35.7%), multibranch (n=22; 52.4%), and mixed (n=5; 11.9%). CTAs were followed up yearly. Results: Endografts were deployed successfully in all patients in a single session. Two patients with dissections underwent endovascular fenestration prior b-EVAR. Catheterization of the fenestration/ branch was successful in 98.25% (169/172) patients. One case was solved with the chimney technique and the two remaining cases were not stented; no late endoleak occurred. The mean fluoroscopy time was 84.8\u00b133.6 minutes, mean contrast media volume was 338.6\u00b1129.6 ml, and mean intervention duration was 348.8\u00b11115.5 minutes. The 30-day mortality was 9.5% and the 180-day mortality was 14.3%. The 30-day complication rate was 21.4%. Four cases of paraplegia (9.5%) were observed, 2 of which healed by spinal cord drainage. The follow-up was conducted for 21\u00b118 months (4-34; 25 th -75 th ). No surgical explantation or renal insufficiency occurred. Fenestration/ branch primary patency at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 99.4% and 98.8%, 97.7%, 97.1%, and 96.5%, respectively, and secondary patency at 72 months was 100%. The endoleak rate was 28.5%: 5 type III, 1 type I, and 6 type II without aneurysmal sac enlargement ",

The main objective of this study was to analyze imaging findings, treatment, and outcomes of aortoesophageal fistula and provide an update on our experience at the Second Xiangya Hospital. Background Although life-threatening, the clinical manifestations of AEF can be very subtle and nonspecific. Clinical Findings/Procedure A total of 7 patients with AEF had been recorded in the Second Xiangya Hospital since 2011, and all of them underwent computed angiotomography examination. The authors analyzed the clinical data and compared the outcomes with previously published cases. All 7 patients complained of retrosternal pain; 3 of them had a sentinel episode of minor hemorrhage. There were mainly 3 types of imaging manifestations. Type 1 was foreign body directly penetrating into the aorta with or without surrounding inflammation (3 cases). Type 2 appeared as an ulcer of the aorta with surrounding inflammation (3 cases). Type 3 showed pseudoaneurysm of aorta (1 case). The foreign body of types 2 and 3 can be invisible or away from the aorta. Patients with type 1 imaging were treated with open thoracic surgery. Patients with type 2 received thoracic endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), and 1 of them received a secondary open thoracic surgery due to mediastinal infection 4 months later. Compared with previous studies, our cases showed a relatively better outcome, that is, except for the patient with type 3 imaging who had conservative treatment and died during hospitalization, the other 6 patients recovered after a follow-up of 5-36 months.",

Vascular complications reduce flow by obstructing (thrombosis or stenosis), leaking, or \"stealing\" flow. Angioplasty with or without stenting and thrombolysis is a valid option for treatment, and its use is described in the setting of liver transplantation. Flow physiology may also be changed by embolizing vessels causing \"stealing\" from the hepatic artery (namely splenic vessel) as well as by embolizing portosystemic collaterals. Biliary complications may also require drainage (of bilomas or intrahepatic ducts) or dilation of a stenotic biliary duct. We will review the most common complications focusing on the imaging modalities used to diagnose them, the interventional procedures available, and their expected successes as well as demonstrate some cases treated at our institution.",

These procedures are also often associated with substantial levels of post-procedural pain because of bile leak and subsequent peritoneal irritation. Previous studies have confirmed that track embolization can substantially reduce hemorrhage and bile leak risks. Clinical Findings/Procedure Prepare avitene by mixing a 1 g sachet with a desirable amount of diluted contrast (we often use a solution of 3.5 ml normal saline mixed with 4.5 ml Omnipaque 240 mg I/ml). Withdraw the sheath a few millimeters under fluoroscopy to a position just proximal to the level of entry point to a portal vein branch or biliary duct. Gradually, inject the avitene solution through the side-arm of the introducer sheath under fluoroscopy filling the sheath while avoiding overflow of the solution beyond the tip of the sheath. Cut the tapered part of the sheath dilator and advance it a few millimeters through the hemostatic seal of the introduced sheath valve.

Background Benign biliary tract stenoses are a relatively rare condition. In some cases, interventional treatment is a challenge. Balloon dilatation and temporary metallic stent placement are possible treatment options, though biodegradable stents seem to be a very good alternative. Clinical Findings/Procedure Our group consisted of 12 patients with biliary tract stenosis recurrence after standard percutaneous treatment. Initial treatment for all patients was percutaneous transhepatic drainage, followed by a series of balloon dilatation (average 2.9 per patient) and middle-term percutaneous drainage (average 4.8 months). In all cases, patients underwent the manometric test before cessation of drainage. A biodegradable stent (ELLA company) was implanted in all patients. After stent implantation, all patients were followed up at regular intervals at our intervention department. Patients were monitored using ultrasound and clinical examination, including laboratory tests for determining bilirubin and liver enzyme levels.",

Background Percutaneous abscess drainage is the standard of care in the absence of other indications for immediate surgery. Variety of disorders can lead to fluid collection in the lower abdomen and pelvis. These pelvic collections can be drained using several approaches, with the transgluteal approach being useful and effective. The advantages of the US approach are that it is safer, faster, and lacks radiation; less procedure and sedation time, no radiation exposure, and the use of real-time color Doppler can avoid vascular structures. The main disadvantage is the poor sonographic penetration of the deep pelvic tissues even for an average-sized adult.",

Patient in prone position. Utilizing a curved 3-5MHz transducer to scan the pelvis from the parasacral window. The coccyx can be palpated and used as a landmark to have the puncture site just lateral to it to avoid the neuro-vascular bundle. The needle should be then directed caudo-cranially towards the targeted collection. Start scanning in oblique-sagittal or axial planes. Choose your entry point. Drainage can be performed using the Seldinger or trocar technique under local and conscious sedation. The catheter is to be removed if the output drops to <20ml/day for 48-72hours. Conclusion US-guided transgluteal drainage is an alternative route for pelvic collections. It is safe and effective for moderate-to-large fluid collection in non-obese patients and can spare the valuable CT time.",

Purpose Nowadays, the detection of subcentimeter thyroid nodules by ultrasound (US) is a common clinical situation. In the last decade, the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased especially due to increased detection rate in screening exams. Almost 50% of these detected thyroid cancers are carcinomas smaller than 1.0 cm in diameter. US characteristics have been studied as predictors of thyroid malignancy and have been grouped under TIRADS classification.

Background Epidural blood patches have been used to relieve symptoms associated with intracranial hypotension. Intracranial hypotension has diverse origins and most cases result from a cerebrospinal fluid leak that can occur after lumbar puncture, myelography, and spinal anesthesia or spontaneously. Iatrogenic leaks allow a more targeted treatment approach with an epidural blood patch due to the knowledge of the location of the leak, while the origin of spontaneous leaks is more covert. A lumbar approach is often considered given the lower risk of spinal cord damage. However, it has a lower efficacy rate when compared with a targeted one. Hence, in the treatment of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid spinal leaks, a double epidural approach (DEBIT) allows for greater coverage of the spinal epidural space with an autologous blood patch.",

A MELD exception score prioritizes patients with HCC due to increased mortality. To standardize the imaging characteristics that determine transplantation eligibility, the UNOS criteria was introduced. Recently, application of the MELD exception score was delayed to 6 months due to imbalances in transplantation opportunities between candidates with HCC exceptions and those with MELD score-based allocation priority. A tubular illustration of the organ allocation system with UNOS criteria will be presented. Subsequently, the varying techniques of liver transplantation and the role of IR in early-stage disease will be discussed via clinical examples.

Background CBCT is a new imaging technology that enables acquisition of crosssectional imaging with modern angiographic systems equipped with a flat panel detector; it allows the combination of tomography with conventional 2D angiographic imaging and dedicated software during interventional procedures to plan treatment, navigate/position the catheter or device, monitor the treatment, and assess the final result. Clinical Findings/Procedure CBCT can be very effective during embolotherapy procedures in the visualization and localization of hepatic, renal, prostate, and renal lesions; in tumor-feeding vessel identification; and in therapy assessment. CBCT may also enable ablation procedures requiring CT guidance in the interventional fluoroscopy/angiography suite without CT and without impacting workflow, especially in facilities without a dedicated IR CT. Once the ablation is complete, repeat CBCT can be performed to rule out periprocedural complications and assess the adequacy of the ablation zone. Conclusion CBCT imaging is a new and empowering imaging technology to add to the arsenal of the interventional radiologist/interventional oncologist; thus, CBCT is expected to become a mainstay imaging modality in tumor embolotherapy. Multimodality navigation, semi-automatic fusion, semi-automatic vessel detection, dual-phase CBCT, ablation planning, and synergy with ultrasound are early and emerging options, the added values and potential advantages of which are in the process of being defined. Certainly, CBCT is one of the most interesting and empowering IR/IO tools to emerge in recent times.",

The important components of cost analysis methodologies include the following. First, which methodology will be used, e.g., cost minimization, cost utility, and cost effectiveness. Second, from what perspective is the analysis performed, i.e., who pays for the intervention?

Three patients suffered PDAA rupture; in 2, it was due to SAM, and in 1, it was due to MALC. When the aneurysmal neck size was less than half the aneurysmal short axis, we used packing only, and when it was more than half the short axis, we embolized vessels distal and proximal to PDAA (isolation). Nine patients underwent coil packing of the aneurysmal sac only to preserve the native arterial circulation; 6 of the remaining 14 underwent isolation with simultaneous stenting of the stenotic celiac axis. Antiplatelet administration was stopped in 2 patients with celiac stent occlusion due to varicose veins of the lower extremities or hypermenorrhea. All PDAAs were successfully excluded. Two patients with isolation of the transverse or dorsal pancreatic artery developed acute pancreatitis; 1 who underwent coil packing developed coil compaction after 6 months and underwent a 2 nd coil embolization. There were no other complications. Conclusion TCE is an effective alternative treatment for patients with PDAA.

Under the circumstances of failed catheterization of the artery, direct puncture of the artery may be considered as an alternative to surgery. Furthermore, lower fluoroscopy time and minimal usage of contrast medium are the advantages of this new technique, possibly making it the first choice for access in pregnancy. Its disadvantage is the necessity of experience with probeneedle cooperation.",

We will review treatment methods and clinical outcomes for various types of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms. Background Hemoptysis is a potentially life-threatening condition. CT is very useful for the initial assessment of hemoptysis. CT shows the underlying lung parenchyma abnormality and the abnormally dilated systemic arteries that may require embolization. In addition, CT can also be useful in the evaluation of hemoptysis of the peripheral pulmonary artery origin. Despite the fact that pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms are uncommon, an awareness of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm is important because its treatment is different from that of hemoptysis originating from bronchial or non-bronchial systemic collateral arteries. Clinical Findings/Procedure Underlying lung abnormalities of the patients were tuberculosis, mycetoma, necrotizing pneumonia, and lung cancer on radiation therapy. CT finding was analyzed by means of axial, MPR, and MIP images. Pulmonary artery and/or bronchial or non-bronchial systemic collateral arterial angiographies were performed. Endovascular treatment was performed by direct embolization of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm or embolization of bronchial or non-bronchial systemic collateral arteries using microcoils, n-butyl cyanoacrylate, or PVA particles. Immediate hemostasis was successfully achieved, and pulmonary artery pseudoaneuryms disappeared on follow-up CT scans.",

Hepatic artery aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm are rare but important entities with a high morbimortality. They are the second most common visceral aneurysms and account for approximately half the pseudoaneurysms. Endovascular treatment is the first line treatment for such lesions. Different materials and techniques have been used depending on the characteristics and location of the lesions. Currently, the standard treatment for visceral pseudoaneurysms is the exclusion of the lesions by coils along the pseudoaneurysm and aneurysm necks (sandwich technique).

Background None of the commercially approved endovascular embolic devices are available in sizes large enough for blood vessels more than 24 mm in diameter. year-old man, who 9 years earlier had undergone the aortoaortic bypass for an abdominal aneurysm, presented with dehiscence at the distal anastomosis and retroperitoneal hematoma. The diameter of the aneurysm sac was 13 cm, but it had been almost 16 cm 8 months earlier. Because the aortic conduit was only 20 mm in diameter, emergency endovascular placement of an AUI graft, occlusion of the contralateral common iliac artery, followed by femoro-femoral crossover bypass was considered to be the best minimally invasive treatment option. The iliac artery was however 25 mm in diameter, and an iliac plug of appropriate size was not available. Therefore, we decided to use an undersized vascular occluder (AMPLATZER Vascular Plug II, St.Jude Medical) instead. Simultaneous deployment of a 16 mm and a 14 mm occluder alongside each other led to rapid occlusion of the artery, and the patient could successfully be treated as planned.",

The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate radiopacity and visibility of contrast-loaded SAP-MSs. Material and methods 1) SAP-MSs were suspended in nonionic contrast material (iodixanol) and a change in the diameter was observed using a stereomicroscope. 2) Contrast-loaded SAP-MSs were mixed with diluted contrast and change in the diameter was observed sequentially. 3) Radiography of the contrast-loaded SAP-MSs was taken using an angiographic system, and visibility was evaluated quantitatively by contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and qualitatively by multiple reader scoring. Results 1) In a pure contrast material, the diameter of SAP-MSs increased for approximately 15 minutes and reached an equilibrium. Finally, the diameter was 4.5-5.0 times greater than its original size. 2) When contrast-loaded SAP-MSs were mixed with diluted contrast material, the diameter further increased by 10%-40% in several minutes and then returned to the previous size in approximately 30 minutes.",

First-line treatment includes ERCP sphincterotomy or repeated balloon dilatation with percutaneous biliary drainage placement. Clinical Findings/Procedure In our department, patients with benign biliary strictures are managed with cholangioplasty and biliary drainage placement as the first-line treatments. If the stenosis persists, patients become candidates for BRS placement. In 2016, nine patients were treated with this technique: five cases with hepaticojejunostomy strictures secondary to cholecystectomy or DCP, two cases with strictures after liver transplant, and the remaining two with stenosis due to main bile duct inflammatory insult. At the six-month follow-up, no patient experienced any major complication or BRS displacement, with no cases of restenosis.

Jackson 2 1 Clinical Radiology, St Mary's Hospital, London, United Kingdom, 2 Imaging, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom Learning Objectives 1. To recognise that portosystemic varices develop across surgical anastomoses in the presence of portal hypertension and pose a high risk of recurrent, life-threatening gastrointestinal haemorrhage. 2. To recognise that such varices are more common than generally expected and may easily be overlooked on cross-sectional imaging. 3. To understand that most varices are best managed via a transportal approach. Background Transanastomotic portosystemic varices develop in patients with portal hypertension. A well-recognised site of the former is around enterostomies, resulting in so-called stomal varices. A much less well-recognised site of involvement is across the jejunoduodenal anastomosis of a pancreatic transplant. Such varices pose a high risk of recurrent life-threatening gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and prognosis is extremely poor as they often go unrecognised. Clinical Findings/Procedure Transanastomotic portosystemic varices are best managed via a transportal approach with retrograde catheterization of the transanastomotic varices and sclerotherapy. In addition to describing the successful use of this technique for managing stomal varices, this educational poster reports the first successful management of varices related to a pancreatic transplant using the same approach.",

The median time interval between the end of pregnancy and massive bleeding was 28.3 days (range 6-68). Technical success, clinical success, complications, angiographic features, and fertility after UAE were retrospectively assessed. Technical success was defined as embolization of the bilateral uterine arteries or unilateral uterine artery of the affected side achieving contrast stasis over five cardiac beats. Clinical success was defined as no rebleeding or hysterectomy during the follow-up period. Results Technical success and clinical success were achieved in all 14 patients after the mean follow-up period of 25 months (range 1-105). No major complications occurred. Angiographic features of RPOC were tortuous feeders flowing into the focal blush of contrast (n=14). Additional findings were pseudoaneurysm (n=6), early venous return (n=4), and extravasation (n=2). In seven cases followed up for more than 1 year after UAE, menstruation had restarted in all patients and conception was achieved in 5 patients.

Background Transarterial SIRT with yttrium-90 also known as radioembolization is a therapy based on the administration of resin or glass microspheres loaded with the radioisotope yttrium-90 via selective arterial catheterization of tumor-feeding vessels. It is classified as a type of locoregional therapy. SIRT's main goal is to treat patients with primary or secondary hepatic lesions that are unresectable and not responsive to other therapies. Because it is a new technology still restricted to very few hospitals in Brazil but used on patients throughout the country, it is necessary to demonstrate the main imaging aspects of the liver lesions treated with SIRT based on MRI in addition to delineating the interpretation considerations of these images. Clinical Findings/Procedure MR images of patients treated by SIRT were used. Control examinations were performed 2 and 6 months after the procedure.",

Because the lines can be displayed at any angle in the 3-dimensional virtual fluoroscopic image, we could also choose an appropriate working angle beforehand and perform the procedure in this state.

Based on these, patients were stratified into three categories: most appropriate, appropriate, and least appropriate. The diagnostic studies in these patients were compared with CTAP, and its effect on further management was analysed.",

Microwave ablation (MWA) produces large ablation zones (AZs) in a short time; however, AZ prediction is based on preclinical ex vivo models, raising concerns about reproducibility and safety in humans. We aimed to investigate the effects produced by a new generation MWA system on human liver in vivo with different approaches (percutaneous or intraoperative) and under different liver conditions (cirrhosis or previous chemotherapy treatment) in comparison with manufacturerprovided predictions based on ex vivo animal models. Complete tumor ablation (CA) and early clinical outcomes were also assessed.",

Complications were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. From 6 to 10 months postoperatively, no serious or fatal complication or local tumor recurrence was observed. The surgical route was a 100% match with the 3D reconstruction planned route. Compared with CTA, MRI shows 99% (29/30) of the nearby small vessels. Multiseries 3D reconstruction efficiently showed postoperative signal change and ablation margin. Conclusion MRI and 3D reconstruction are feasible and effective in planning and evaluating liver MWA for hepatic tumors. First, we successfully performed MWA under MRI guidance with safe and efficient monitoring. Vertical and parallel surface display has given more and precise information for evaluation and follow-up. Furthermore, DWI shows its potential ability in evaluating the heat area and change in the ablation area and normal tissue. In conclusion, the benefit of 3D analysis over existing techniques lies in its ability to provide complete tumor information that is pathologically more accurate and representative. The available clinical data strongly support the advantages of 3D quantitative tumor analysis over non-3D techniques for the assessment of tumor response.",

Furthermore, a small overall tumor area and high Lipiodol deposition were predictive of response 1 and 3 months post-TACE on applying the qEASL guidelines. BL tumor enhancement showed a weak correlation with Lipiodol deposition (24 h CT; R 2 =0.106). Extratumoral Lipiodol washout was substantially higher than intratumoral washout. Conclusion BL tumor enhancement showed a weak positive trend in predicting Lipiodol deposition after cTACE. High tumor enhancement at BL and Lipiodol deposition on initial follow-up (24 h) were predictive of response to therapy till 6 and 3 months post-TACE, respectively.

To highlight with illustrated clinical cases the role of interventional radiologists (IRs) in optimizing SBRT for oligometastatic CRC disease. Background Surgical resection of oligometastatic CRC disease can prolong survival. However, patients may not be ideally suited for surgery owing to the inability to discontinue chemotherapy preoperatively or due to other comorbidities or they may prefer a less invasive therapy to maintain their quality of life. Recently, SBRT has emerged as a local non-invasive ablative therapy that provides good to excellent local control with minimal morbidity in both curative and palliative settings based on published retrospective and prospective studies. IRs are playing an increasing role in collaborating with radiation oncologists in planning and delivering safe and effective SBRT. IRs with their invaluable expertise and technical skills can facilitate such a therapy by enhancing the target discrimination for precise irradiation to the target lesion volume at different disease sites while minimizing the irradiation of normal tissues.",

This phenomenon preferably occurred when the tumor was in segments 1 and 4, which correspond to large arterio-arterial communications like the communicating arcade.",

To highlight the importance of pre-procedural planning to obtain an adequate ablation zone and estimate the most effective ablation time and power using the Emprint Ablation System \u00ae . 3. To describe different techniques and approaches used to effectively ablate challenging renal tumours. Background Thermal ablation has an important role in the management of small renal cancers. RFA is currently the most common ablative modality used to treat such tumours. Previous MWA technology had certain technical limitations resulting in unpredictable ablation zones. Recent technical improvements enable the production of more predictable spherical or oval ablation zones, with better-defined margins.",

Arellano 2 1 Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States of America, 2 Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States of America Learning Objectives To discuss the technical success, safety, and oncological and renal function outcomes of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous thermal ablation for synchronous multiple renal masses in a single session. Background Surgical interventions for multifocal renal cell carcinoma (RCC) must be balanced between tumor eradication and preservation of renal function. A paradigm shift to non-surgical therapies of small renal masses (<4 cm) favors the use of thermal ablation over surgical methods. Thermal ablation with radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, or cryoablation may have a role in the management of multifocal RCC. Clinical Findings/Procedure Biopsy-proven RCC was treated in 23 patients. Mean tumor size was 2.3 cm (range=1.0-4.6 cm), with a mean RENAL nephrometry score of 6.3 (range=4.0-10.0), mean PADUA score of 7.8 (range=6.0-11.0), and mean centrality index (c-index) of 3.1 (0.7-6.8) . Mean ablation time was 23 minutes (range=3-24 minutes). Technical success was achieved for 100% of tumors. There were 9/49 (18 %) Clavien-Dindo grade I complications.

The Spiegel's lobe can be safely treated with these electrodes; however, in the latter access, there are some noble vessels between the left hepatic lobe and Spiegel lobe (portal branch, hepatic vein and left gastric artery). Another difficulty lies in the fact that the coronary vein is commonly dilated in patients with cirrhosis, a group in whom percutaneous approaches are most often listed. In this way, careful selection of the best caudate lobe puncture pathway to avoid lesions in the noble locoregional structures is the best and minimally invasive percutaneous approach for this anatomical site.",

Background Profound and thorough expertise of our senior consultants, fast development of user-friendly materials and most importantly very friendly and productive long-term cooperation with thoracic surgeons makes tracheoesophageal stenting a very well-established and implemented procedure for overcoming mostly malignant and also benign debilitating tracheal and oesophageal strictures with a very low rate of complications. Clinical Findings/Procedure First, we would like to share the many examples of successful stenting of various tracheobronchial malignant strictures, tracheobronchial malacia, inflammatory stenoses, traumatic strictures, anastomotic strictures, extrinsic compressions and fistulas. Second, we would like to illustrate the importance of a high-quality preprocedural imaging. Third, we would like to discuss the different types of stents available (silicone stents, balloon-dilated metallic stents, self-expanding metal stents and covered self-expanding metal stents) and make the reader familiar with the rules of their use as well as with the exciting techniques of their deployment. Most importantly, by sharing our complications and their management, we would like to contribute to avoidance of such potentially disastrous events.",

The widely used dose calculation method based on BSA or the partition model (PM) provides values for the whole liver or for three partitions (lung, liver, and tumor) only. Because radioactive microspheres are often selectively applied to arterial vessels, we proposed a more local dose distribution based on arterial supply territories.",

All 11 patients underwent lymphatic intervention, including selective or complete TD embolization. All 11 patients had resolution of chylothorax, with a median of 18 days (IQR 6-47) from intervention to discharge.

Background Microvascular thrombosis plays a dominant role in the vascular stasis phase of frostbite and is the pathophysiological basis for tissue ischemia and late necrosis. Intra-arterial thrombolysis can be used as a part of multidisciplinary approach for severe frostbite injuries of hands and feet. Six patients with altogether 12 extremities (9 hands and 3 feet) and 60 affected digits were treated. Clinical Findings/Procedure A 5 F diagnostic catheter is navigated from common femoral artery access into brachial artery in case of hand ischemia, or superficial artery in case of foot ischemia, correspondingly. The infusion rate of t-PA is 0.3 mg/hour and with urokinase 30 000 units/hour, correspondingly. Control angiography is scheduled every 12-24 hours. Concurrent low molecular weight heparin is administrated, and in selected cases, intravenous infusion of eptifibatide is also used during and after thrombolytic therapy for 24-36 hours. Thrombolytic therapy is terminated when the angiographic response is complete or after 48 hours. Among the 12 treated extremities, good or excellent angiographic response was achieved in 10 extremities (83%). The clinical recovery was good in all these 10 limbs, with no amputations. In 2 limbs, the angiographic response was only fair, resulting in the amputation of 5 digits at the interphalangeal level, with the total rate of amputations being 8.3%.",

Clinical Findings/Procedure Lymphatic leaks may occur as a complication of congenital diseases and after trauma to the lymphatic system, mainly after oncological or cardiothoracic surgery. If a conservative approach is not effective in managing the leak, surgical and interventional treatments may be the only options to treat chylorrhage and its complications. When leaks are below 500 cc/24 h, lipiodol itself can act as a contrast and therapeutic agent. When leaks are larger, direct embolization may be required.

Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the cystic fluid was followed by injection of absolute ethanol (99%) into the lesion. The injected volume of ethanol was 50%-80% of the volume of fluid aspirated. The mean index volume of the cysts was 26.4 \u00b1 15.7 mL (range: 3.8-49.9 mL) . After ablation, the mean volume of the cysts decreased to 1.2 \u00b1 1.1 mL (range: 0.0-3.5 mL).

Although the proportion of patients achieving post-procedure TIMI scores of 2-3 were not significantly different for patients who underwent MTA or IAT (88.2% versus 84.6%), the median time-to-reperfusion for patients who underwent MTA and IAT were 69 min (IQR: 55, 149) and 1408 min (IQR: 1072, 1552), respectively (p<0.001).

Background Reduction of radiation exposure is a major goal in diagnostic and interventional radiology. However, CT-guided infiltrations of spinal nerves, facet joints, and sacroiliac joints are frequently performed using unnecessary high doses. Clinical Findings/Procedure CT-guided infiltrations usually follow this sequence: application of a scout image, selection of the target area to be scanned by a helical or axial planning scan, and targeting using step-wise needle control scans. When using a planning scan at 120 kV/80-85 mAs (CTDIvol 6.8-7.3 mGy) and control scans at 120 kV/33-40 mAs (CTDIvol 2.9-3.5 mGy), dose length products (DLPs) of 62-78 mGycm are achieved. In contrast, application of low-dose protocols using planning and control scans at 80 kV/49 mAs (CTDIvol 1.4 mGy) may provide DLPs of 12-22 mGycm, which allow for a substantial dose reduction. The 80 kV/49 mAs images are sufficient for visualization of the relevant bony landmarks. Conclusion CT-guided infiltration of the spine should be performed using a reference DLP of \u226430 mGycm. This is possible by the careful selection of the scanned target area on the scout image and use of protocols with 80 kV/49 mAs images. ",

Background RAAs account for 15%-22% of visceral artery aneurysms. Routine use of CT and MR imaging has led to an increased diagnosis of RAAs. Based on the location and morphology, RAAs can be classified as saccular, fusiform, aneurysmal, and intrarenal microaneurysms. These aneurysms have a female predilection and demonstrate a higher incidence in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia and hypertension. Less than 50% of patients are symptomatic, but symptoms such as rupture, arterial thrombosis, abdominal pain, and hematuria may develop. RAA rupture is rare, with a reported incidence of 0%-10%. Rupture incidence appears to be high in large aneurysms (>2 cm) and in pregnant women. Rupture mortality is approximately 50% for the mother and 90% for the fetus. Clinical Findings/Procedure RAAs can be treated with surgical or endovascular approaches with the common endpoint of preventing aneurysmal expansion and rupture by excluding the aneurysm from the arterial circulation and pressure. Management depends, in part, on the location of the aneurysm but is also determined by factors, including patient age and sex, severity of hypertension, anticipated pregnancy, and anatomic features of the aneurysm, including size.",

The mean greatest diameter of tumor was 3.35\u00b12.4 (min: 0.6; max: 14.7) cm. No immediate or short-term complication was observed. Conclusion STAE is a feasible and safe minimally invasive interventional procedure. By the combined usage of 3DRANG and CBCT, more precise excision and lesser complications in LPN have been achieved. We present a renal failure patient who received a donor kidney complicated with flow-limiting external iliac dissection. We demonstrate through our case that this rare complication can be successfully managed with endovascular techniques that salvage a failing donor kidney.",

Kaplan-Meier test was used to calculate 2-and 5-year primary patency rates of TIPS stent. Results TIPS through the strut of a previously placed stent with strut plasty was technically successful in all the patients (100%). The mean portosystemic pressure gradient reduced from 24 \u00b1 5.9 mmHg [pre-TIPS portosystemic pressure gradient (PPG): range, 15-31 mmHg] to 8.57 \u00b1 4.4 mmHg (post-TIPS PPG: range, 3-14 mmHg). One patient required 3 sessions of TIPS revisions. Another patient needed TIPS revision after 5 years of TIPS creation. All patients showed improvement in clinical symptoms, lab parameters, Child-Pugh score, and MELD score during mean follow-up of 40.57 \u00b1 34.9 months (range, 3-100 months). Primary patency rates of TIPS stent measured with Kaplan-Meier estimate at 2-and 5-year follow-up were 100% and 71%, respectively (95% CI, 0.36-0.92).

Background Cirrhosis and portal hypertension remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, the treatment of refractory hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains a challenge for both patients and physicians. Failure of conventional medical therapy for HE or encephalopathy occurring in the context of well-preserved liver function may indicate the presence of a large portosystemic shunt, which could be amenable to percutaneous occlusion. This has the potential of decreasing or completely ceasing the frequency of HE episodes with a minimally invasive approach.

The ease of access into the portal vein reduces difficulties often faced when combining portal vein access with additional procedures such as antegrade/retrograde venous obliteration, portal vein thrombolysis, and even variceal embolization. The authors advocate the use of ICE catheters for majority of PV access cases given the advantages it provides. Further testing is needed to prove the cost effectiveness of using ICE catheters. . All DVs were located at the second/third junction of the duodenum. The afferent veins were pancreaticoduodenal varices in all cases (100%). The efferent veins were the right gonadal (n=6, 46%), right renal capsular (n=3, 23%), left gonadal (n=2, 15%), left renal capsular (n=1, 8%), and unnamed retroperitoneal veins (n=1, 8%). B-RTO was successfully performed in 10 cases (77%). Among the cases successfully treated with B-RTO, 9 (90%) required adjunctive techniques, including coil embolization of multiple efferent veins, advancing occlusion balloon catheter beyond a minor efferent vein, or simultaneous double balloon occlusion for two efferent veins. Embolic materials included ethanolamine oleate (n=10, 100%) and n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n=1, 10%). Three cases with failed B-RTO underwent percutaneous transhepatic obliteration (n=1), transileocecal obliteration (n=1), or dual balloon-occluded embolotherapy (n=1). Conclusion B-RTO is an effective treatment for DVs, although adjunctive techniques are required in most cases. An antegrade approach can be considered when B-RTO alone fails.",

Daly 2 1 Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Waterford, Waterford, Ireland, 2 Urology, University Hospital Waterford, Waterford, Ireland Learning Objectives 1. The flexible cystoscope is a valuable facility for the interventional radiologist. 2. Retrograde access to the bladder and VUJ allows hybrid IR techniques that fuse the advantages of minimally invasive procedures that obviate the need for GA and OR and can be performed as day procedures. 3. Retrograde access to VUJ and the ureter is an optimal vantage for higher profile metal stenting. 4. Rendezvous procedures optimize vantage and improve outcomes in cases of difficult fistulas and strictures. Background Cystoscopy-assisted stent-exchange (CASE) procedures were introduced to IR in 2013 and allow quick and easy double J stent exchange under sedative analgesia using a flexible cystoscope in the interventional radiology suite. This obviates the need for OR, GA, and rigid cystoscopy and offers the patient a minimally invasive alternative for a conventional urologic procedure. Clinical Findings/Procedure Eighty flexible CASE procedures were performed between 2013 and 2017: 82% females and 18% males; mean age 68 years; malignant stricturing 70%; and benign diseases, including PUJ obstruction, calculous stricturing, iatrogenic injury, fistulas, and AAA comprised the rest. Primary success of in situ stent retrieval, ureteric recannulation, and stent reinsertion was 96%. Secondary success was 100%. Retrograde access to VUJ allowed salvage, including the rendezvous completion of otherwise technically difficult scenarios such as proximal stent migration and unfavorable fistulas. It also allowed retrograde 14-Fr metal ureteric stenting in 13 cases.",

Brookes 2 1 Imaging, UCH, London, United Kingdom, 2 Radiology, University College Hospital, London, United Kingdom Purpose Retrievable IVC filters must be removed to prevent thrombosis and/ or vein stenosis (MHRA 2013). Standard filter retrieval techniques fail in up to 26% patients because of endothelialisation and perforation of filter components. Complex techniques are then required. We present our experience of our escalatory approach for IVC filter retrieval. Standard technique: a single-day procedure under local anaesthesia using a 8-Fr sheath and a loop snare. Failing this, patients were rebooked for a complex retrieval, under general anaesthesia, which included the following: a) using a 16-Fr \u00d7 45-cm sheath via the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) enabling the \"wire-loop snare\" method (Rubenstein, 2007) \u00b1 b) microdissection with a laser via RIJV or using an endoscopic forcep via the common femoral vein (CFV).",

The varied clinical manifestations include hematuria, proteinuria, pelvic congestion syndrome in female patients, and varicocele in male patients. Although the terms nutcracker phenomenon and nutcracker syndrome are used interchangeably in many manuscripts, the term syndrome usually refers to the clinical symptoms related to the phenomenon. Clinical Findings/Procedure Ultrasound imaging findings, including the velocities and the caliber of the left renal vein at various levels, will be discussed along with its implications for management. CT scan and CT angiography findings will be reviewed. Catheter angiography with pressure measurements will be discussed in detail, and endovascular management with angioplasty and stenting will be discussed with illustrative examples.

To learn when to observe and when to hurry Diagnosis of type of endoleak CTA is the standard for follow-up EVAR. However, the distinction between different types of endoleaks can be difficult. In recent years, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been used more often to survey patients after EVAR, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. The advantage of CEUS is the dynamic nature of the method, which allows the distinction between an immediate detection of bubbles in the aneurysm sac typical for type 1 and 3 endoleaks and delayed visibility of bubbles within the aneurysm sac typical for type 2 endoleaks. Because of a long scan time window, CEUS is highly sensitive for delayed type 2 endoleaks (Journal of Ultrasound (2015) 18:91-99). If an endoleak cannot be classified by CTA or CEUS, an intra-arterial angiography may be necessary for accurate diagnosis.",

            "text": "There is a general agreement that type 1 and 3 endoleaks should be treated immediately. Type 3 endoleaks are usually fixed by realigning the leaking part of the stentgraft. Type 1 endoleaks are also often repaired by an aortic or iliac extension if anatomically feasible. Sometimes an additional chimney or fenestration is necessary to preserve flow to the kidneys while sealing the endoleak. Alternatively, the leak can be sealed by embolization. This approach is usually preferred if a chimney is already in place. Because these type 1a endoleaks are rather small, a mechanical blockage is rarely possible. Therefore, liquid agents are more promising. For better stability, a radial approach can be helpful. Treatment of type 2 endoleaks Type 2 endoleaks are common, and especially, early endoleaks (within 30 days) are usually observed. Despite the lack of robust evidence, most centers tend to treat type 2 endoleaks if a sac expansion of more than 10mm is observed (Vascular Health and Risk Management (2016) 12:53-63) . The concept of type 2 endoleak embolization is to occlude the nidus within the aneurysm sac ideally including the dominant vessels of the nidus. There are two different approaches: the transarterial approach, often used when the main portion of the endoleak is in the anterior portion of the sac close to the inferior mesenteric artery, or the direct sac puncture, more commonly used when the dominant portion of the endoleak is in the posterior portion of the aneurysm sac. Alternative routes for direct sac puncture are transcaval or transabdominal. The latter approach has the disadvantage of possible carrying bacteria from the bowel to the aneurysm sac. In either approach, the goal is to get the catheter into the nidus. When using the transarterial route, a microcatheter is nearly always required [cave: long catheters (125cm) and microcatheters (150cm) are needed when using a radial approach]. A coaxial system is also helpful for direct sac puncture to increase the stability. Embolic agents Endoleaks are typically blocked by either a liquid agent or mechanical blocks such as a coil or a plug or their combination. The ethylene-vinyl alcohol polymer (EVOH) has become the preferred liquid agent for most interventionists (Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012) 46:251-257). The advantages of EVOH are the long and controllable working time, the good visibility, and the non-adhesive property avoiding the risk of gluing the catheter into place. The long-term results also seem to be favorable compared with those of other agents. Coils and plugs can be used in combination with liquid agents for large endoleaks to slow down the flow or block a large feeding or draining artery. Coils and plugs alone seem to have a higher recurrence rate than EVOH.",

Different landing zones for proximal landing in arch TEVAR have been classified: zone 0, ascending aorta proximal to the brachiocephalic artery; zone 1, between the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery (LCCA); and zone 2, between LCCA and the left subclavian artery (LSA). 1 When proximal landing is planned in zone 0 (e.g., isolated saccular arch aneurysm or arch and proximal descending thoracic aneurysm with no involvement of the ascending aorta), the repair comprises debranching of all supra-aortic arch vessels, followed by TEVAR simultaneously through the ascending aorta or via the femoral artery, often also staged. 2 Arch debranching is most often performed through a median sternotomy and partial clamping of the ascending aorta. For patients with prohibitive risk for median sternotomy, extra-anatomic debranching of supra-aortic arch vessels has been described. 2 When proximal landing is planned in zone 1 (e.g., pathology of the mid and distal arch with or without involvement of the descending thoracic aorta), the treatment usually includes a left carotid-right carotid-subclavian artery bypass. TEVAR can be performed simultaneously or in a second stage. 3, 4 Finally, when proximal landing is planned in zone 2 requiring coverage of LSA (e.g., pathology of the distal arch or proximal descending aorta), the procedure includes left carotid-subclavian artery bypass or transposition before or during TEVAR. Coverage of LSA without revascularization may also be considered. LSA revascularization seems to lower stroke rates and spinal cord ischemia, particularly during extensive thoracoabdominal repair, and is, therefore, generally advised. 5 S407 LS / HTS or paraplegia after TEVAR are observed in <2% patients. Usually, the symptoms are observed within the first 10 hours after the procedure; however, delayed symptoms may be observed after 24-48 hours once the patient is mobilized and the blood pressure drops. The anterior spinal artery is primarily supplied by the great anterior radiculomedullary artery, which is also known as the artery of Adamkiewicz. Most commonly it originates from a left intercostal artery between T9 and T12 and less commonly from T7-L1 or from the right side. An additional collateral supply comes from subclavian and hypogastric arteries. Risk factors for developing SCI: patient age, renal insufficiency, extent of aortic stentgrafting including the origin of the artery of Adamkiewicz and the adjacent intercostal arteries, occlusion of the left subclavian artery, previous aortic surgery, and intraoperative and postoperative hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 80mmHg). Actions required for reducing the risk of SCI in patients with previously mentioned risk factors: imaging of the artery of Adamkiewicz: contrast-enhanced CT with multiplanar reconstructions may show the artery in approximately 80% cases, 3-T MRA with timeresolved imaging may show the artery in approximately 80% cases, and a combination of both may show the artery in 90% cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage: edematous swelling of the spinal cord due to hypoperfusion increases the pressure in the spinal canal which again reduces spinal perfusion. CSF drainage with pressure recording can keep the pressure below 10mmHg. It has been shown that preoperative or early CSF drainage decreases the probability of SCI by half or more. Monitoring the blood pressure to prevent hypotension with a mean arterial pressure of <80mmHg. Staged stentgrafting for enabling the development of collateral circulation. In thoraco-abdominal aneurysms, one side branch of the prosthesis can be left open or connected by a bare stent temporarily. The second procedure that finally excludes the aneurysm and antegrade perfusion of the artery of Adamkiewicz should be performed with a delay of 4-6 months. Post-operative measures to reverse neurological symptoms once SCI has occurred: high-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy, CSF drainage (pressure < 7-10mmHg), and moderate blood pressure increase (mean pressure > 100mmHg) are standard therapy in the acute phase.

The antimicrobial treatment is critical when dealing with these cases. There is no evidence regarding the optimal duration of antibiotic administration. This may vary from 2 weeks to 1 year, although a minimum of 4-6 weeks of intravenous therapy, followed by up to 6 months of oral therapy is commonly recommended. A small number of cases in which operation was deemed to be associated with an unacceptably high risk to the patient have reported success with long-term suppressive treatment, including lifelong antibiotic administration in some cases 6 . S409 LS / HTS of the type 1 endoleak. Proximal type 1 endoleaks due to inferior placement of the endograft below the renal arteries are usually treated by placement of an aortic cuff. Proximal type 1 endoleaks where there is accurate placement of the aortic endograft are generally due to a poor seal, and these are usually treated initially by support stenting using large caliber balloon-expandable stents, e.g. Palmaz stents (Johnson & Johnson, New Jersey, USA) . Patients with proximal type 1 endoleaks who are not suitable for these relatively straightforward techniques require more advanced treatments, such as fenestrated aortic cuffs or the use of chimney grafts. However, some patients with proximal type 1 endoleaks cannot be treated by any of these techniques or may be resistant to these management strategies. Distal type 1 endoleaks after EVAR are generally treated by endograft extension to the distal common iliac artery or into the external iliac artery if there is no space in the distal common iliac artery. In rare instances, where patients with proximal or distal type 1 endoleaks cannot be treated by the abovementioned methods, embolisation should be considered as a treatment option.",

Endoleaks with a wide communication between the endoleak cavity and the aortic lumen are less suitable for embolisation. In general, majority of the proximal type 1 endoleak embolisation procedures can be performed from a femoral artery access. Unusually, it is necessary to perform these from an upper extremity arterial access. Access into the endoleak cavity is generally achieved with reversed curve catheters such as a Simonds or Sidewinder catheter from the femoral artery access. After manipulating the tip of the reversed curve catheter into the endoleak cavity, contrast medium is injected to define the size of the endoleak cavity. After this endoleakogram has been performed, the endoleak cavity is embolised using the embolic agent of the operator's choice.",

SchroederRadiology, Center for Diagnostic Radiology & Minimally Invasive Therapy, The Jewish Hospital, Berlin, GermanyPurpose: This randomized trial was designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of Stellarex drug-coated angioplasty balloon (DCB), a low-dose (2 \u03bcg/mm 2 surface dose of paclitaxel) DCB, in treating peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery. Material and methods: This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial with blinded core lab adjudicated endpoints. Patients were randomized following successful predilatation to treatment with DCB (222 patients, 254 lesions) or uncoated PTA balloon (72 patients, 79 lesions). The primary effectiveness endpoint was primary patency at 12 months. Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted to assess effectiveness of DCB in females and patients with diabetes. Results: Within the cohort, the primary effectiveness endpoint was met and DCB was superior toPTA [83.9% (188/224)  vs. 60.6% (40/66), p<0.001]. Primary patency was significantly higher in females treated with Stellarex than in those treated with PTA [85.3% vs 61.0% (p=0.0168)], and there was no significant difference in primary patency rates between males and females in the cohort treated with DCB (90.4% vs 85.3%, p=0.3064). Patients with diabetes had a significantly higher patency rate when treated with Stellarex [82.9% vs 71.3% (p=0.0043)] and patients in the Stellarex cohort with or without diabetes had similar patency rates (89.2% vs 88.8% p=0.4724). Conclusion: Superiority of Stellarex over PTA was demonstrated in females and in patients with diabetes. Patency rates were not statistically significantly different when comparing females to males or patients with diabetes to those without diabetes. Stellarex is an effective DCB solution for females and patients with diabetes.

Material and methods: This prospective, randomized (2:1, Ranger paclitaxel-coated balloon:uncoated balloon) study included patients with symptomatic leg ischemia requiring treatment (i.e., Rutherford classification 2-4) and de novo or restenotic lesions in the native non-stented femoropopliteal segment. Approximately 38% of the study patients had diabetes (n=40). The primary endpoint was 6-month angiographic late lumen loss, and efficacy and safety assessments continued at 12 months. Results: Patients with diabetes treated with Ranger paclitaxelcoated balloon cathether (n=28) had a mean lesion length of 70\u00b140 mm, 36% had occlusions, and 46% had severe calcifications, whereas patients in the control group (n=12) had a mean lesion length of 47\u00b134 mm, 27% had occlusions, and 18% had severe calcifications. Late lumen loss at 6 months among patients with diabetes was significantly less for the Ranger DCB group (0.036\u00b11.0 mm vs 0.93\u00b11.3 mm; P=.040). The 12-month follow-up and analysis, including patency, TLR, and safety assessments, will be complete by the time of presentation. Conclusion: The lumen loss analysis suggests that restenosis was inhibited in patients with diabetes treated with Ranger paclitaxelcoated balloon catheter, and 12-month results will show whether this inhibition translates into favorable patency and reintervention rates.Purpose: The IN.PACT Global study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the IN.PACT\u2122 Admiral\u2122 DCB for the treatment of symptomatic femoropopliteal artery lesions across a wider range of patients treated in real-world clinical practice.

Material and methods: The enrollment criteria for this clinical study included the clinical signs of failing dialysis access with the angiographic documentation of a significant stenotic lesion in patients with AVF or AVG circuits. From April 2015 to September 2016, 76 patients[mean age, 60 (range, 19-84)  years] were treated with the PCB dilation of a stenosed venous outflow lesion. Regular duplex ultrasound follow-up was performed. Study outcome measures included device success (<30% residual stenosis), procedural success (<30% residual stenosis), and the primary and secondary patencies of the treated lesion (no need for any interim repeat procedures). PCB angioplasty improved patency after angioplasty of venous stenoses of the failing vascular access used for dialysis mostly in the juxta-anastomotic and native av-outflow tract. No improvement was observed at the prosthetic-venous anastomotic site.Material and methods: TACE sessions(1)(2)(3)(4) were performed using 10mg of idarubicin loaded in the 100-300-\u03bc DC Bead\u00ae. Toxicity assessed according to NCI-CTCTAE v4.0. or evaluated by MRI centralized review using mRECIST criteria was the primary endpoint. The study involved a 2-step Fleming design (H0: OR at 25% at 6 months vs H1: 40%, power=90%, one-sided: \u03b1=5%). Forty-six patients (pts) were included for the interim analysis (91 pts initially planned), and 44 pts were evaluable. Results: Forty-six pts (median age: 71 years range: 44-89 years; male: 87%; Child A: 80%) were enrolled in 7 centers. Performance status was 0 in 83%, 1 in 15%, and 3 in 2%. BCLC status was A in 10.9%, B in 76.1%, and C in 13%. Bilobar disease was reported in 51%, with >3 HCC nodules in 53.5% pts. Complete response, partial response, and stable disease were observed in 6 (13.6%), 16 (36.4%), and 4 (9.1%) pts, respectively. OR rate at 6 months was 50% (90% CI: 36.8%-63.2%). The trial was stopped at interim analysis because of efficacy: OR was achieved in 22 pts (19 pts or more were expected). In term of toxicities, 72% of the patients had at least one grade 3-4 toxicity, mainly transaminase increase. Conclusion: TACE of HCC using the idarubicin-loaded DC Bead\u00ae is well-tolerated and provides a 50% objective response rate at 6 months.

Material and methods: Eighty-four patients with unresectable HCC by tumor board were assigned to TACE and treated with polyethylene glycol drug-elutable (PEG) embolics loaded with doxorubicin. Patients were prospectively enrolled and included 32 (76%) males and 10 (24%) females. Median sample age was 65 years (range 42-83). Patients were treated with 50 mg of doxorubicin loaded in 2 ml of PEG embolics (diameter 100\u00b125 \u03bcm) that were infused via the chemoembolization method. Data collected included previous cancer therapy, tumor size, number of lesions and TACE, tumor response (1, 3, and 6 months), type and intensity of adverse events, and quality of life (QoL). Results: One month following TACE, tumor response rate was 79% [complete response (CR)=50%, partial response (PR)=29%, stable disease (SD)=17%, and progressive disease (PD)=5%]. At 3 months, CR=48%, PR=24%, SD=24%, and PD=3%. At 6 months, CR, PR, SD, and PD were 43%, 19%, 29%, and 10%, respectively. TACE was welltolerated by all patients with evidences of no procedure complications or systemic drug-related side effects. Fever (33%), transaminase rise (17%), and pain (35%) were the most frequent side effects, with a mostly mild intensity (G1-2). QoL was 80 at 1 month after TACE and 81 and 82 at 3-and 6-month time points, respectively.

Material and methods: In total, 1636 patients who underwent CAS with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were retrospectively analyzed. Indications for CAS were in accordance with the NASCET criteria. A bilateral CAS was performed in two sessions in 147 patients. A cerebral protection device (CPD) was used in 94.7% patients, whereas no CPDs were employed in 136 patients (8.3 %) for anatomical complexity. Pre-and post-CAS medication was administered according to standard protocols. Results were analyzed correlating neurological complications with the operator's experience, plaque morphology, and patient age. Results: Technical success was achieved in all cases. After a mean follow-up of 76\u00b132.4 months, 1236 patients (75.5%) were alive, with a 30-day mortality of 1.9%. In-stent restenosis occurred in 18/1636 patients (1.1%) and was solved with angioplasty in 5/18 patients (27.7%) or re-stenting in 13/18 patients (72.2%). Primary patency was 98.7%; the secondary patency rate 100%. Neurological events occurred in 3.2% patients. Results were analyzed correlating neurological complications with the operator's experience, plaque morphology, and patient age. Neurological disorders were 1.9% in asymptomatic patients and 4.5% in symptomatic ones (p=0.001) and they proved to be higher in older patients (>80 years) than in those <80 years (6.4% vs 2.7%; p<0.05). The overall neurological adverse events were 6.1% in patients with complex plaques and 1.0% in those with stable plaques (p<0.001).

Sutter 1 1 Radiology, H\u00f4pital Jean Verdier (APHP), Bondy, France, 2 Radiologie Pr Trillaud, CHU de Bordeaux, Pessac, FrancePurpose: The percutaneous ablation of superficial subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (SSHCC) remains controversial because of a high risk of complications, such as hemorrhage and tumor seeding along the needle path. These complications are mainly related to the direct tumoral puncture needed when using mono-applicator ablation devices. No-touch multi-bipolar radiofrequency ablation (NTMBP-RFA) allows the treatment of SSHCC without tumoral puncture. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of NTMBP-RFA in SSHCC. mm] were treated with NTMBP-RFA. The assessment of response and follow-up relied on CT or MRI performed at 1 month after treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Complications were graded according to the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) classification. Effectiveness in terms of local tumor progression (LTP) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method. Signs of peritoneal or parietal tumor seeding were examined in follow-up imaging studies. Results: NTMBP-RFA achieved complete response in 58/59 (98.3%) SSHCCs after 1 (n=52) or 2 (n=6) procedures, and 1 patient was transplanted after the first NTMBP-RFA failure. One patient (1.7%) developed a major complication (septicemia with liver failure; SIR D). Eighteen patients (31%) exhibited imaging anomalies without clinical impact (SIR A) 1 month after NTMBP-RFA. After a median followup of 25 (range: 1-93) months, LTP occurred in 5/58 patients with 1-, 2-, and 3-year LTP-free survival rates of 98.3%, 94.8%, and 91.3%, respectively. No patient exhibited signs of tumor seeding. Conclusion: NTMBP-RFA is an effective and safe treatment option for SSHCC within Milan criteria.Initial experience with the transapical access for TEVARA.H. Mahnken 1 , M. Irqsusi 2 , W.

Conclusion: IRE represents a safe and effective technique for small CRLMs that are unsuitable for surgical resection and thermal ablation. The outcome appears promising with regards to local tumor control, although the relatively high number of early distant site recurrences should keep us wary. The results mandate the setup of a trial comparing IRE to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for CRLMs unsuitable for surgical resection and thermal ablation.

Procedure-related complications, stent patency, and survival after the treatment were investigated.ResultsThere were 5 cases of type IIIa, 2 cases of type IIIb, and 2 cases of type IV hilar cholangiocarcinomas; 1 case of hepatocellular carcinoma; and 5 cases of pancreatic carcinomas. Deployment of percutaneous RFA plus metal stent implantation was technically successful in all patients. Fifteen stents had been implanted successfully. No acute pancreatitis, hemobilia and perforation, bile leakage, or other severe complications occurred. There were 7 cases of procedurerelated cholangitis and 4 cases of postoperative abdominal pain. The serum direct bilirubin levels decreased 1 week after the procedure. The median stent patency was 125 days (95% CI 92-147). The survival was 6.3 months (95% CI 4.5-12.5). Two patients undertook a second RFA at 156 and 167 days because of stent restenosis. Six patients died during the follow-up.ConclusionPercutaneous RFA plus metal stent implantation is a safe and feasible therapeutic option for the palliative treatment of malignant bilioenteric anastomosis stricture post-choledochojejunostomy.

All patients were treated with unilateral or bilateral stent placement in a T, Y, or X configuration using covered or uncovered stents.ResultsA total of 784 stents were successfully placed in 415 patients. Fiftyfive patients had major or minor complications, including hemobilia (n = 19), cholangitis (n = 13), cholecystitis (n = 11), bilomas (n = 10), peritonitis (n = 1), and hepatic vein-biliary fistula (n = 1). Removal of temporary drainage catheter was achieved in 370 patients (89.1%). Ninety-seven patients were lost to follow-up. Stent dysfunction occurred in 154 of 318 patients: tumor ingrowth with/without overgrowth (n = 107), sludge incrustation (n = 44), and other causes (n = 3). The median patient survival and stent patency were 212 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 186-237 days] and 141 days (95% CI, 126-156 days), respectively. In terms of stent patency, there were no statistical differences in age, sex, underlying disease, Bismuth type, stent type, or stent configuration. Stent type and configuration did not significantly affect technical success, complications, successful internal drainage, patient survival, or stent patency.ConclusionPercutaneous stent placement is technically safe and effective for internal drainage in patients with MBHO.

Diagnostic cholangiogram was obtained to assess the level of obstruction. Strictures were dilated using 8-12-mm-diameter balloons followed by placement of 8-10-Fr internal-external drainage catheters, which were removed 2-5 days post-PTBD cholangiography. Follow-up was performed using clinical assessment, liver function tests, and ultrasound. Fischer's exact test was used to determine the association between recurrence of strictures and PTBD sessions.ResultsThirty-seven patients underwent PTBD, including 10 (27%) males and 27 (73%) females. Mean age was 41.3 years (range 23-70 years). Twenty-nine patients (78.4%) were treated with choledochojejunostomy and 8 (21.6%) with hepaticojejunostomy. A 100% success was achieved in all the PTBD sessions. Nineteen (51.3%) patients were treated with a single PTBD session. Mean follow-up time was 36 months (range 1-75 months). Eighteen (48.7%) patients needed reintervention; 11 (29.7%) were symptom free after the second session at the 3-year follow-up, and 3 (8.1%) were symptom free after the third session of PTBD. No significant difference in developing recurrent strictures after 1 st and 2 nd PTBD sessions[18 (48.7%)  vs. 7 (39%); p<0.5716] was observed. Four (10.9%) patients required metallic stent placement after the third session. Three (8.1%) patients developed stones; in 2 (5.4%) patients, stones were removed percutaneously, and 1 (2.7%) patient required surgical removal. Conclusion PTBD is a safe treatment for BES; however, there is risk of recurrent BES after 3 years of PTBD sessions.

To understand the role of percutaneous gallbladder stenting in patients with cholecystitis. 2. To understand the procedure technique and considerations. Background \u2022 Image-guided percutaneous cholecystectomy is a recognized temporary treatment for critically ill patients with acute cholecystitis. \u2022 Definitive treatment following cholecystostomy is usually by means of subsequent cholecystectomy. \u2022 In some cases, cholecystectomy is contraindicated due to preexisting patient comorbidities. In such cases, endoscopic gallbladder stenting can be performed, although this has a reported technical failure rate of around 20%. \u2022 Anterograde gallbladder stenting via the existing cholecystostomy tract provides an alternative minimally invasive approach.Clinical Findings/ProcedureAreas that will be presented in this poster include the following: \u2022 Indications for anterograde gallbladder stenting. \u2022 Procedural considerations for performing anterograde gallbladder stenting, including approach used for initial cholecystostomy to facilitate subsequent gallbladder stenting. \u2022 A step-by-step guide to perform the procedure. \u2022 Expected outcomes and follow-up drawing based on experience from our institution.ConclusionWith increasing number of elderly patients showing multiple comorbidities presenting with cholecystitis, alternatives to conventional surgical intervention such as percutaneous gallbladder stenting need to be considered.

Overall mortality rate was 26.7%. Mortality rate following necrosectomy was 50%. Conclusion From our experience, majority of the patients can be treated with percutaneous image-guided drainage alone without progression to necrosectomy, which is inherently of high risk. Mortality rate remains high in this challenging group of patients though our series, demonstrating a favourable outcome when compared to existing literature (up to 43%).

Background Increasing prevalence of antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents complicates periprocedural care. Present guidelines frequently lead to unnecessary delays in care, increased cost, and overuse of reversal agents. Clinical Findings/Procedure Category 1: No lab requirement. Do not hold anticoagulants. Non-tunneled venous line, IVC filter placement/retrieval, dialysis intervention, para-/thoracentesis, catheter or venous line exchange/ removal, thyroid FNA, and superficial node biopsy. Category 2: INR 1.7-2.0, platelets 25,000-50,000. Hold anticoagulants except ASA. Restart in 6 hours. A. Correct intraprocedurally: Tunneled line/peritoneal/pleural catheter, transjugular liver biopsy, angiography (\u22647 Fr), cholecystostomy, and abscess drainage. B. Correct preprocedurally: Port placement, gastrostomy/jejunostomy placement, and percutaneous biopsy (except renal or spleen). C. Tunneled central venous lines: INR < 2 and platelets > 20,000 Category 3: INR < 1.7, platelets > 50,000. Hold all anticoagulants. Restart in 24 hours. Renal/spleen biopsy, nephrostomy, biliary drain placement, TIPS, and percutaneous ablation. Conclusion 1. Present guidelines lead to delays, increase cost, and expose patients to needless risks. Our protocols aim to optimize patient care and minimize unnecessary usage of reversal agents. 2. No need to transfuse FFP for INR \u2264 1.7. 3. Hold anticoagulants for five half-lives (i.e., 97% elimination) for near complete reversal in a non-emergent setting. 4. For emergent reversal of warfarin, provide periprocedural infusion of 4 U FFP or Kcentra. Do not recheck INR. Radiology in social media: a 15-month trend M. Hailemariam, A. Sidhu, S. Handa, D.

Toward this purpose, a novel aneurysm screening method has been developed using an oscillometric device, which can measure the pulse wave velocity (PWV), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and pulse volume recording (PVR) simultaneously. Basic idea is that aortic aneurysms can cause propagation loss of pulse wave due to the abrupt expansion of the aortic wall, possibly enabling aneurysm detection. The aneurysm detection algorithm had been established from PVR data obtained from the learning cohort, and its diagnostic ability was evaluated in this prospective study.",

Audit standards were as follows: (1) justification of insertion, (2) retrieval should have been attempted for 100% temporary IVC filters, (3) documentation of the retrieval plan, and (4) To learn about the weaknesses of new devices New generation devices for the endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms have been developed and marketed to improve on existing technology in several ways. Some new devices have been developed to extend the range of anatomy and geometry treatable by EVAR. Others have been developed to simplify the procedure using parallel stents rather than bifurcated devices. The parallel stents of the Nellix device (Endologix) have radically changed the concepts of treating aneurysms with polymer-filled endobags designed to remove the risk of type 2 and other endoleaks by sealing the aneurysm in the technique of endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS). Devices designed to extend the range of a treatable anatomy include low-profile devices to allow treatment of patients with small access vessels and flexible devices designed to seal angulated necks, which are outside the IFU for other stentgrafts. The Gore IBE graft is a bifurcated iliac graft for the preservation of internal iliac arteries. The Nellix device was CE marked in 2013, and 2-year data from the FORWARD registry have prompted an analysis of late failures of EVAS due to migration, endoleaks, and aneurysm growth. The IFU for the Nellix device were changed in 2016, and physicians were notified of these changes via a Field Safety Notice in October 2016.The new IFU reduce the upper limit of the aortic neck diameter to 28 mm and have redefined the aortic neck as ending where the diameter increases by 10% rather than 20%. Another change is the introduction of an \"aneurysm ratio\" defined as the maximum aortic diameter divided by the maximum aortic blood lumen diameter. This must be less than 1.4. Thus, a large aneurysm with a small lumen will contain lots of mural thrombus and would not be treatable on-label with the Nellix device according to the 2016 IFU. The Altura graft from Lombard medical is a low-profile system comprising two separate stentgrafts, which can be repositioned to optimise their position below each renal artery. We now have 15-year data from the EVAR trials using early devices. It is hoped that latest generation devices will improve on these results, but until the promises of these devices translate into long-term data, physicians need to continue with careful surveillance and ensure that results are published through post-marketing surveillance or other studies. To learn about outcomes of devices with inner branches The evolution of fenestrated and branched endovascular techniques is enjoying the increasing widespread. Technical feasibility and durability have been demonstrated in many presentations and publications. Our personal experience now includes over 1100 fenestrated and branched cases. The experience has grown over the years in terms of not only more complex cases but also numbers per year. This has been made possible by the technical evolution of both stentgrafts and ancillary products and further technical refinements. More complex anatomies and thereby more patients can now be offered an endovascular solution.",

            "text": "To address target vessels in complex abdominal (AAA) and thoracoabdominal (TAAA) aortic aneurysms, two solutions have been proposed: fenestrations (holes in the graft) and directional side branches. In general, fenestrations work well for target vessels that have a close to 90\u00b0 take-off from the aorta and when the main graft at the level of the target vessel is appositioned to the wall or there is only a short gap to be bridged. Nowadays, a balloon-expandable covered stent is routinely used to seal the fenestration and to maintain perfusion to the target vessel. The Achilles' heel of fenestrations is the stability and durability of the seal between the nitinol ring of the fenestration and the covered stent, especially when there is a longer gap to bridge. Exact positioning of the graft with alignment of the fenestrations to the target vessels is mandatory, and catheterization can be tedious. Directional branches work well when target vessels have a steep take-off angle and when there is a longer gap to be bridged, which is often the case in TAAAs. Other advantages of directional branches include a better seal and fixation for the bridging stentgraft and the less critical positioning of the branch with regard to the target vessel. Disadvantages include the required \"upper\" approach (subclavian, axillary, or brachial) to catheterize the branches and target vessels and the stiffness of the available bridging stentgrafts. Because most side branches are directed downwards, the bridging stentgrafts have to accommodate an acute angle, especially for renal arteries. In most branched stentgrafts, the diameter of the main graft is tapering down above the level of the branches in order to create room for the branches. This means that the sealing zone needs to be achieved far above the branches.Most complex AAAs are treated with fenestrated grafts. This is not only because of the anatomical configuration of the target vessels but also because using branched grafts would mean starting much higher in the descending thoracic aorta, leading to a TAAA repair and thereby increasing the risk of paraplegia. For TAAAs, we prefer a tailored approach by choosing the ideal configuration for each individual target vessel. This has resulted in the use of many stentgrafts incorporating both branches and fenestrations.Recently, inner branches as a third option for visceral arteries were discussed. The Cook inner branches present with a cylindrical part inside the main graft connected to the wall via a basket-type bag.With the Cook device, the opening of the basket is diamond shaped because of the support by Z-stents. This inner-branch design gives an extra option for target vessels that are not particularly well-suited for either fenestrations or directional branches. One example is the target vessel that presents with a steep take-off in conjunction with a smaller diameter of the aorta. With inner branches, there is no need to taper the main graft, which provides more wall contact and sealing at the level of the visceral arteries. It also reduces the need to start much higher in the aorta, as discussed above, and may therefore reduce the risk of paraplegia. A technical advantage is provided by the support of the basket that automatically directs the catheter and the wire into the direction of the target vessel and facilitates catheterization. The basket also provides support to the bridging stentgraft, which reduces the risk of not only migration and disconnection but also kinking. A total of 24 patients (22 male, mean age, 71.3\u00b18.4 years) were treated with inner branches at our institution. Indication for treatment was a TAAA in 18 patients and a pararenal aneurysm in six patients. Technical success was achieved in all patients. A total of 38 inner branches were used (right renal artery: n=7, left renal artery: n=13, superior mesenteric artery: n=5, and celiac trunk: n=13). Catheterization of target vessels proved to be easy in all patients with a combination of fenestrations and inner branches. In two patients with inner branches only, the main graft had to be repositioned to achieve catheterization. Complications occurred in 2/38 (5.3%) inner branches, resulting in a subcapsular kidney hematoma, one of which required embolization. In-hospital mortality was zero. During follow-up (mean, 4.5\u00b13.7 months), one renal inner branch occluded 6 months after the procedure, leading to creatinine elevation to 1.5 mg/dl. One patient required a reintervention (not related to inner branch) to treat a disconnection of a bridging stentgraft from a fenestration for the superior mesenteric artery.In conclusion, the \"inner branch\" technology offers another valuable option, which enables the manufacturing of a more fitting custommade graft.",

The evolution of endovascular therapy has changed the way of treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in a way that no one could have imagined 20 years ago. The promising initial results have been confirmed by more recent studies. Moreover, long-term follow-up supported the use of stentgraft (EVAR) for the treatment of AAAs. What we have also observed is an increase in the inclusion criteria; initially, only those patients who were not good candidates for surgery were considered suitable for EVAR, but with each passing year, endovascular procedure has become the treatment of choice even in more complex situations such as short and angulated necks. Recently, the 15-year follow-up of the EVAR-1 trial reported an aneurysm-related mortality rate greater for patients who underwent EVAR compared with that for those treated with open repair; however, the authors stated that during the entire follow-up, the aneurysm-related mortality was not significantly different between the two groups. It is interesting that half the patients treated for infrarenal AAAs were still alive 10 years after aneurysm repair. The OVER randomized trial with a follow-up of 9 years showed no differences between EVAR and open repair regarding survival, quality of life, costs, and cost effectiveness. After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, mean life-years were 4.89 in the EVAR and 4.84 in the open repair groups. Similar results were also reported in the DREAM trial: 12-year after initial randomization, the cumulative overall survival rates were 42.2% after open repair and 38.5% after endovascular repair. Unlike the EVAR-1 trial, increased aneurysm-related mortality after EVAR over the long term was not found in the DREAM trial. Both EVAR 1 and DREAM trials showed the highest rate of reintervention to be between 4 and 6 years depending on stentgraft durability. However, we have to consider that these data are correlated with the use of \"first\" generation devices and that the increased mortality rate seems to be correlated with a higher incidence of post-EVAR sac rupture. Therefore, reintervention rates might be higher compared with more recent studies investigating newer generation stentgrafts.C RSE This is also confirmed by a recent study comparing long-term outcomes with newer and older stentgrafts that demonstrated similar perioperative and long-term mortalities.",

CT-based follow-up, although highly reliable, is hampered by the significant exposure to ionizing radiation and the repetitive administration of iodinated contrast medium that may lead to radiationinduced disease and renal failure. Furthermore, these examinations cause a significant economic burden that may comprise 30%-50% of costs of EVAR follow-up. Finally, with the development of newer generation stentgrafts, a better knowledge on the behavior of stentgrafts, the importance of endoleaks and mechanisms of stentgraft failure, and better sizing and planning (using 3D tools) the number of complications related to EVAR has been reduced significantly. All these factors require and allow for a more tailored approach for EVAR follow-up. This presentation will discuss the rationale behind such individualized programs of follow-up and will provide algorithms that allow a reduction of the number and alter the type of follow-up examinations after EVAR.",

In general, abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) deserve treatment when they reach a diameter of 5.5 cm. 1 Smaller aneurysms, as shown by the CAESAR trial, do not deserve treatment even with endovascular repair because there is no survival benefit overall. 2 For thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), the treatment indication threshold has always been 6 cm, mainly in view of the higher risk of an extensive surgery. In TAAA repair, the impact and risk of surgery is so high that many patients are refused open repair. According to the literature, a high proportion of these TAAAs will rupture and lead to death. 3 The option to treat TAAA by endovascular means has logically opened the way to treat patients who would not be offered open repair. 4 As always, minimally invasive techniques are then \"overused\" before learning to respect the anatomical restrictions and other limitations. With regard to patient risk stratification, little is known because most articles on complex endovascular techniques state that they treated \"high-risk\" patients. We reviewed the results of our TAAA branched cases in terms of the learning curve with regard to technical success, mortality, and outcomes. Growing experience has undoubtedly led to better planning and better execution, with lower technical failure and the possibility to treat more complex anatomies. The main question for this presentation is whether there still are limitations with regard to the patient risk status. The risk balance analyses are based on the age and comorbidity of the patient on one side and extent of aneurysm and anatomical limitations on the other. The literature should be appraised critically because there is never a clear definition of \"high risk.\" Looking back at the 300 TAAA branched cases, in an attempt to divide the patients into an \"old and frail\" patient group versus a normal \"high-risk\" group, mortality was clearly higher in the \"old and frail\" group with 22.7% versus 6.2% in the normal \"high-risk\" group (P<.001) and survival was lower with an overall mortality of 52.9% versus 18.7% (P=.006) at a mean follow-up of 24.2\u00b120 months. It is therefore safe to conclude that indications to treat old and frail patients should be exerted with extra caution, especially in TAAAs with borderline diameters or with a challenging anatomy. Conclusion: \"Primum non nocere\" in old and frail patients. in the presence of short or adverse necks Despite improvements in surgical expertise and anesthesia, mortality and major morbidity after open surgical repair (OSR) in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain significant. The introduction of the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) technique in 1991 provided a less invasive option for AAA, 1 challenging and altering the conventional OSR paradigm. Several trials comparing EVAR with OSR showing favorable differences in morbidity have endorsed the use of endovascular techniques for AAA repair, with excellent early and midterm results. [2] [3] In fact, EVAR offers a less invasive approach, thereby giving patients who are deemed unfit for OSR an option for repair. However, rupture may still occur after EVAR, and reinterventions are not infrequent. As a consequence, the long-term efficacy of EVAR, especially in patients at a low risk of open repair, is still debated. The ACE trial shows that EVAR and OSR in low-to-moderate-risk patients carry a similar risk of early and medium-term death, major adverse events, and minor complications. However, EVAR was associated with more vascular reinterventions and a trend toward a higher aneurysm-related mortality. 4 Despite the minimally invasive nature of endovascular repair, anatomic suitability may limit the use of EVAR. Some reports suggest that >50% of patients have anatomic constraints to traditional endovascular aortic repair. 5 The primary limitation to using standard abdominal stentgrafts in the treatment of AAA is the proximal landing zone and the inability to obtain an adequate proximal sealing. 6 As per the instructions for use (IFU), standard abdominal stentgrafts require a minimum proximal aortic neck of at least 15 mm to achieve adequate sealing. Without an adequate sealing zone, patients are at risk for migration, endoleak, and aneurysm rupture. AbuRahma et al. reported that although endovascular repair was suitable for short-necked aneurysms, there was an association with increased type I endoleaks mostly requiring an early reintervention. 7 In a study performed by Abruzesse et al., the authors found that deviating from IFU parameters resulted in increased mortality, reintervention, and graft-related complications. 8 To address the exclusion of patients with aneurysm necks of <15 mm from endovascular repair, fenestrated devices (FEVAR) were introduced. FEVAR allows for an additional sealing zone above the renal arteries, thereby increasing the number of patients able to undergo an endovascular repair. Published literature about FEVAR has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this technique, with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates. A literature review with pooled results for 931 patients and 2465 stented target vessels showed a 30-day mortality of 2.4%. 9 Verhoeven et al. stated in a recent paper that FEVAR, because of the high technical success, low operative mortality, significant regression of aneurysm sac diameter, high target vessel patency, and acceptable rate of reinterventions, today represents the first-line strategy for patients with short-necked, juxtarenal, or suprarenal aortic aneurysms regardless of the preoperative status of the patient. 11 In fact, FEVAR was initially developed to treat highrisk patients unfit for open surgery and anatomically unsuitable for standard EVAR. Gradually, FEVAR was also offered to patients at high or average risk of open repair as long as morphologically feasible. However, despite the increased feasibility of endovascular repairs with the multiple endovascular options available today, there are certain anatomic constraints that may require the use of open AAA repair. The definition of hostile proximal aortic neck implies not only chacteristics such as the minimum length but also other anatomical factors such as infrarenal neck angulation > 60\u00b0, neck calcification or thrombus covering >50% circumference of the aortic diameter, and a reverse taper morphology. Antoniou et al. systemically reviewed the studies comparing the outcomes of EVAR in patients with a hostile and friendly neck anatomy. They found that although patients with a hostile neck had no significant increase in the early incidence of type I endoleaks and reintervention rates, EVAR in patients with a hostile neck required more adjunctive procedures to achieve proximal sealing compared with that in those with a friendly anatomy. Furthermore, it resulted in a two-fold increased risk in the 30-day morbidity, a four-fold increased risk in type I endoleaks, and a ninefold increase in the risk of aneurysm-related mortalities within the 1-year follow-up. They finally suggested that EVAR should be cautiously used in patients with a hostile neck. 10 The IFU for FEVAR have been developed with rigorous clinical investigation to determine adequate sealing zones and an appropriate long-term suitability. However, several institutions have explored outside the limitations of fenestrated endovascular devices with increased fenestrations, scallops, and physician-modified endografts. The results of these studies are limited to institutional device exemptions, case series, and clinical trials, thus prohibiting their generalizability. Raux et al. compared FEVAR with OSR in the treatment of complicated AAAs and found a higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality in favor of OSR. Their results demonstrated that FEVAR had a higher rate of 30-day mortality and procedure-and graft-related complications. 12 With this in mind, we can state that the use of FEVAR should always be based on a conservative approach for the interpretation of the manufacturer's IFU. This is much more valid for the quality of the proximal neck in terms of angulation, calcification, and thrombosis than in terms of length. In fact, in case of short but straight necks and reduced distance between the ostium of each renovisceral vessel, a custom-made device with 3 or 4 fenestrations may be planned in order to ensure proximal sealing in a non-diseased aorta. On the other hand, the use of FEVAR in thrombus or a calcified neck may result in an incomplete apposition of the stentgraft to the aortic wall or worse the deployment of a fenestrated stentgraft in a severely angulated proximal neck may lead to an unpredictable misalignment of the fenestrations with a dramatic impact on target vessel revascularization. Although the continuous research and development of new devices and techniques implies that the applicability of endovascular therapies today is very high, there are still some anatomical constraints that may limit their use, and all vascular centers should continue to perform open AAA repair for patients with anatomy outside device protocols. The choice between OSR and EVAR in patients at a high risk of open repair is still debated and should rely on the balance of different risks: more postoperative transfusions, longer hospital stays, and incisional complications with OSR vs. the need of ",

To learn how these adjuncts work and how to use them 3. To learn about the early results with these adjuncts More and more EVAR repairs are performed in patients with challenging infrarenal aortic necks. A short neck length (<15 mm), diameter > 28 mm, conicity, and infrarenal angulation > 60\u00b0 are wellknown hostile neck parameters. Although newest commercially available endografts have been developed to overcome challenging neck features, the risk for acute technical failure has increased. Therefore, the interventionist must be prepared for repair of acute type IA endoleaks or to improve the suboptimal position of the endografts. In case of a distance of >5 mm between the lowest renal artery and the top of the fabric, an extension cuff can be placed. If no extension can be achieved but an acute type IA endoleak occurs, the use of the Heli-FX Aortic Securement System (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) can be of great help. Targeted treatment of EndoAnchors at the type IA endoleak gutter has been proven to be successful in >90% of patients included in the global ANCHOR trial. Use of giant stents to improve circumferential apposition of the endograft to the aortic wall may be beneficial, but it precludes eventual future endovascular options at the juxtarenal aorta. If the seal between the endograft and aortic wall is <1 cm and a type IA endoleak persists, the best off-the-shelf option is a chimney extension. A subclavian artery or brachial artery approach is necessary with the use of 6-7-Fr braided sheaths and balloon expandable or self-expanding chimney stentgrafts. Last but not the least, challenging access arteries may necessitate adjuncts during primary EVAR. Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of stenotic or dissected iliac arteries must be performed in 2%-5% of patients. Moreover \"paving and cracking\" of narrow endograft limbs is sometimes necessary to improve outflow. It can be concluded that the endovascular team should be prepared for adjunctive procedures during the primary EVAR procedure to overcome endoleaks and to improve longer term outcomes.",

To learn about the indications for using chimneys 2. To learn about the limitations of chimneys 3. To learn about the results with chimneys, also in the long term Abdominal aortic aneurysms unsuitable for conventional EVAR necessitate consideration of open surgery or in higher risk patients, endovascular techniques such as fenestrated or chimney endovascular repair 1 . Fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR) has shown good short-and long-term results but is disadvantaged by cost, manufacture time, and lack of \"off-the-shelf\" availability. Chimney EVAR (ChEVAR) has been developed as an alternative and is cheaper, simpler, and readily available, making it useful in the emergency setting. Issues have been raised, however, regarding the seal between the chimney stents, the main body, and the aortic wall 2, 3 . Some studies have reported good technical success rates in the short and long term, whereas others have not. Furthermore, the long-term patency of the chimney stents has been questioned. One meta-analysis showed comparable results between ChEVAR and FEVAR with respect to technical success and mortality rate; however, the number of target vessels was significantly less in the ChEVAR group compared with that in the FEVAR group 4 . Another systematic review demonstrated advantages of FEVAR with respect to 30-day mortality, late mortality, and renal adverse events 5 . However, ChEVAR conferred advantages of a reduced procedure time, lower contrast dose, and reduced intraoperative blood loss. Although the patency rate of target vessels in ChEVAR has been a theoretical concern, in many studies, it has been found to be comparable with that in FEVAR. All agree, however, that both techniques are options for treating aneurysms with insufficient proximal seal zones for conventional EVAR 4, 5, 6 . Until recently, the use of ChEVAR has been off the IFU for all stentgrafts. The PROTAGORAS study demonstrated a good technical success, low type Ia endoleak rate, high primary patency, and acceptable freedom from intervention rate 7 . The Medtronic Endurant TM II stentgraft systems are now CE marked for use in the ChEVAR technique.In conclusion, do use chimneys when there are few other options. They have a role in the management of aneurysms with short necks in high-risk patients unsuitable for open surgery. ChEVAR is particularly useful for patients with large or symptomatic aneurysms in whom the wait time for manufacture of a fenestrated stentgraft is unacceptable. It is also a bail-out option when proximal extension of an attempted standard EVAR is necessary either for type Ia endoleaks or unplanned coverage of the visceral arteries. However, the long-term durability remains uncertain, and there is a limit to the number of possible chimneys with >2 likely to compromise the seal zone. Therefore, don't use them when there is a suitable proven alternative. To learn about the mid-and long-term results Open aortic arch repair is technically demanding and associated with significant perioperative mortality and morbidity. The evolution of endovascular technology has provided alternative treatment options, particularly for older or surgical high-risk patients. These options include a purely endovascular approach (fenestrated and branched devices and parallel chimney grafts) or a \"hybrid\" To learn about rescue methods in case of complications Over the past 20 years, stentgrafting (TEVAR) for proximal entry closure has become an accepted treatment in patients with type B dissections (TBADs). Although intervention in complicated TBADs is warranted, its role in uncomplicated TBADs is still controversial (1, 2, 3) . Against this backdrop, procedure-related complications acquire special significance. Acute complications that may occur as a consequence of TEVAR for TBADs include the following: 1. Access vessel injury 2. Stroke 3. Conversion to type A dissection 4. Spinal cord injury 5. Uncontrolled tearing of the intimal flap 6. Aortic rupture Access vessel dissection or rupture resulting in bleeding and necessitating open surgical repair was reported in 3%-8% of the patients in the earlier days of TEVAR. The key to reducing these complications lies in proper patient selection and adequate preprocedural assessment of the iliac and femoral vessels with respect to vessel calcification and tortuosity (4, 5) . Stroke is one of the most dreaded complications of TEVAR for TBADs. Although it is primarily an embolic complication, injury to the arch vessels may also contribute. The incidence of stroke ranges between 3% and 6%. The risk of stroke is directly associated with atheroma burden of the aortic arch, history of stroke, coverage of the proximal descending or entire descending aorta (extent A or C coverage), type III aortic arch, zone 1 deployment, and coverage of the left subclavial artery without previous carotid-subclavian bypass (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Retrograde type A dissection as a complication occurs in 1%-3% of the patients. Such iatrogenic dissections most often require open surgical repair and are associated with a high mortality (5, 10) . Spinal ischemia complicating TEVAR is less common than stroke, with a reported incidence of 2%-3% for all aortic pathologies (9) . Its incidence in TBAD patients is anecdotal (11) . Aneurysm as an underlying pathology, the use of an iliac conduit, and history of open or endovascular repair are more frequently associated To learn about the diagnosis of infected grafts 3. To learn about the different treatment options Although rare, endograft infection is a known complication after EVAR/TEVAR. In a retrospective cohort study of patients operated for abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms in two large hospitals in the Netherlands, 11 cases of infection were found among 1431 endovascular procedures, indicating an incidence rate of 0.8% 1 . The median time from initial TEVAR/EVAR to the diagnosis of infection was 115 days, with about half of the patients (42%) presenting within 3 months after EVAR/TEVAR. Emergency cases had a statistically greater incidence than elective cases (2.8% vs. 0.6%, p=0.002). The diagnosis of graft infection is based on a combination of criteria, including clinical symptoms such as fever and pain; clinical findings such as necrosis, purulent fluid, or infected graft material; elevated infection parameters such as ESR, CRP, and WBC; evidence of graft infection on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, leucocyte scan, or positron emission tomography; and isolation of microorganisms from either the blood and drain material or the endograft itself 2 . There are 4 principles for the management of endograft infection. First, the excision of the graft as a foreign body potentiating infection; second, a wide and complete debridement of devitalized and infected tissue to provide a clean wound in which healing can occur; third, the establishment of blood flow to the distal bed; and fourth, the institution of intensive and prolonged antibiotic coverage to reduce sepsis and prevent secondary graft infection. The gold standard for treatment of an infected prosthetic aortic endograft remains the explantation of the graft and the reperfusion of the area by placement of a new graft through an extra-anatomic uninfected route, usually an axillo-bifemoral graft. Because of persistent problems with durability and patency, many authors have advocated the use of in situ reconstructions. This can by achieved by either a new prosthetic graft or an autologous graft, usually the femoral vein (NAIS procedure) 3 . For TEVAR infections, in case of an aortoesophageal fistula, a unique treatment option consists an esophagectomy followed by a tube gastric replacement together with great omentum plasty over the infected thoracic aorta 4 . In these cases, an in situ cryopreserved aortic allograft is also an option whenever this graft is available 5 . Finally, in high-risk patients, where a complex procedure",
