Regimen-related toxicity (RRT) remains a frequent and major complication of HSCT. 1 Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is one of the most common life-threatening RRTs reported to occur in 5-60% of patients undergoing HSCT. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Clinically, VOD is characterized by jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, ascites and weight gain from fluid retention. In its most severe form, it often leads to multiorgan failure and death.

Early pathologic changes include edema of the subendothelium of hepatic venules, followed by thrombosis of the venular lumen. 9 Risk factors for VOD have been reported to include a previous history of viral hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests at the time of HDCT and HSCT, the use of high-dose preparative regimens, mismatched or unrelated donor HSCTs, and the use of vancomycin or amphotericin B.

Once daily at 0800 h, patients received a single subcutaneous injection of dalteparin 2500 anti-Xa i.u.

Dosage adjustments were made in cases of renal failure as follows: patients developing moderate to severe renal insufficiency (calculated creatinine clearance p20 ml/min) received a 50% dose reduction of dalteparin (ie, 1250 anti-Xa i.u.). In those patients requiring dialysis for renal failure, dalteparin was not administered. If renal function subsequently improved, then dalteparin administration was recommenced. Patients were reevaluated at day +100 to determine HSCT outcome and whether cases of documented VOD had resolved.",

The incidence in the literature varies from 5-60% depending on a number of patient characteristics such as disease status at the time of HSCT, previous therapy, pre-existing liver disease etc as well as the type of transplant and prophylactic strategy utilized. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In its most severe form, it often leads to multiorgan failure and death 6 . Despite encouraging reports utilizing defibrotide for established severe VOD following HSCT, 29 the mortality remains high and effective prophylactic strategies are needed. Hepatic VOD is believed to result from injury to the vascular endothelium of small hepatic venules, induced by the HDCT conditioning regimen. 1, 7 The endothelial injury is often followed by superimposed thrombosis and progressive fibrosis of the venular lumens. 9 A number of prophylactic strategies have been explored in an attempt to prevent the endothelial damage and subsequent thrombosis including antioxidants, antiinflammatory agents, hydrophilic bile salts and various anticoagulants with varying success 13-23 . A recent randomized prospective trial has suggested that ursodeoxycholic acid administration postallogeneic HSCT decreases the incidence of hepatic complications. 18 This benefit, however, appears to be because of a reduction in the incidence of acute GVHD and nonrelapse mortality and not because of a reduction in the incidence of VOD. 18 Therefore, its specific role in VOD prophylaxis may be limited.",

            "text": "The use of standard low-dose UH as VOD prophylaxis has been the subject of several early studies, 13,19-23 only one of which was a prospective randomized controlled trial. 22 Two of these uncontrolled trials showed an apparent benefit for UH, 19 ,23 however, the study by Bearman et al using various doses of heparin resulted in a high incidence of bleeding or anticipated bleeding (50%) and a high incidence of VOD (71%), bringing in question the efficacy of UH in VOD prophylaxis. 20 There has been only one prospective randomized controlled trial of UH in VOD prophylaxis reported by Attal et al. 22 In that study, patients undergoing HDCT and autologous or allogeneic HSCT were randomly assigned to receive UH 100 U/kg/day as a continuous intravenous infusion commencing day \u00c08 until day +30 post HSCT or no prophylaxis. UH administration appeared to be efficacious with a reduction in the incidence of VOD from 13.7% in the patients receiving no prophylaxis to 2.5% in the patients receiving UH, without an increase in bleeding episodes. This trial has been criticized, however, for the small number of patients (11%) at high risk of VOD before commencing HDCT, none of whom developed VOD irrespective of whether they received heparin or not. Therefore, despite the apparent overall positive results of the Attal trial, the role of UH remains controversial and the majority of subsequent studies examining the role of UH in VOD prophylaxis have not shown a clear benefit for UH. 13, 21 LMWH has a number of potential advantages when compared to UH including greater bioavailability and longer plasma half-life because of less plasma protein binding, a more predictable anticoagulant response, no need for laboratory monitoring, a low incidence of HIT and in some studies, a lower incidence of bleeding. [24] [25] [26] [27] 30 There have been a number of clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of LMWH to UH in the prophylaxis and treatment of DVT in medical and surgical patients. [24] [25] [26] [27] These studies have consistently shown that LMWH is both efficacious and safe with a low incidence of bleeding complications. All of these qualities potentially make LMWH an attractive anticoagulant agent in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant setting where the majority of patients experience a variable period of thrombocytopenia and increased risk of bleeding.",

Only three of 40 (7.5%) patients developed significant bleeding requiring transfusion of PRBCs and 24 (60%) patients developed minor mucosal bleeding or petechiae. No patients died of hemorrhage or suffered any permanent sequelae because of bleeding. These results are in keeping with the 7-23% incidence of serious bleeding reported in the literature for patients undergoing HDCT and HSCT irrespective of whether they are receiving low doses of systemic anticoagulants. 20, 31, 32 In the pilot study reported by Bearman et al comparing the incidence of VOD and severity of bleeding between a cohort of patients receiving low-dose UH and a control group of patients, the incidence of major bleeding in those patients receiving UH was 7% and all but one patient displayed evidence of minor bleeding. 20 The site and severity of bleeding, however, was not statistically different between the UH and control groups. Similarly, in the study reported by Or et al 31 where patients undergoing HSCT were randomized between LMWH and placebo, the incidence and duration of bleeding was in fact lower in those patients receiving LMWH. This would support the fact that patients undergoing HDCT and HSCT are at an inherent risk of bleeding because of the development of obligate thrombocytopenia and damaged mucosal surfaces. The administration of low-dose UH or LMWH does not appear to further increase the risk of serious hemorrhage in this patient population and the need for maintaining higher platelet transfusion thresholds in those patients receiving low-dose systemic anticoagulants does not appear to be warranted.",

            "text": "Our pilot study was designed to primarily examine the safety and feasibility of LMWH (dalteparin 2500 IU daily) administration to patients undergoing HSCT. The small number of patients, the lack of randomization and risk stratification made a determination of efficacy difficult. Despite these limitations, the incidence of VOD in our study was 22% and only one patient developed severe VOD. These results are encouraging when compared to the 20-50% reported incidence rates from large published studies where no specific VOD prophylaxis was utilized. 2, 3, 6 Three of the 18 patients (17%) undergoing autologous HSCT is this study developed moderate VOD. While this incidence is higher than what is commonly reported in the literature for this patient population, our results may have been affected by the small number of patients undergoing autologous HSCT, in addition to specific patient characteristics, which may influence the incidence of VOD within individual studies. Finally, the diagnosis of mildmoderate VOD, accounting for eight of the nine patients in our study, can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from other causes of mild hepatic dysfunction such as infection, GVHD and various medications, and this may lead to an overestimate of the true incidence of VOD in this patient population. 7, 8 In summary, this pilot study has demonstrated that the administration of LMWH (dalteparin 2500 anti-Xa i.u. daily) to patients undergoing HDCT and HSCT is well tolerated and safe with a low incidence of serious bleeding events. The efficacy of LMWH compared to UH for VOD prophylaxis, however, remains controversial and whether either preparation is superior to no prophylaxis is unknown. This should be addressed within the context of a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial.",
