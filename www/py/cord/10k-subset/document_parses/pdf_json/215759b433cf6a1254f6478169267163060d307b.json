We confirmed the response with a contemporary H3N2 influenza virus A/New York/238/2005 (NY/238). To understand the local cellular response, we also evaluated the impact of paracrine factors on virus-induced chemokine and cytokine secretion. In addition, we investigated the changes in the expression of macrophage receptors and uptake of pathogens after PR/8 infection. Although macrophages fail to release a large amount of infectious virus, we observed a robust induction of type I and type III interferons and several cytokines and chemokines following influenza infection. CXCL9, 10, and 11 were the most highly induced chemokines by influenza infection. UV-inactivation abolished virus-induced cytokine and chemokine response, with the exception of CXCL10. The contemporary influenza virus NY/238 infection of AM induced a similar response as PR/8. Inhibition of TNF and/or IL-1b activity significantly decreased the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8 by over 50%. PR/8 infection also significantly decreased mRNA levels of macrophage receptors including C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1), and CD36, and reduced uptake of zymosan.

Consistent with the mRNA data, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CCL5 were the main chemokines induced by the virus, and AM secreted slightly more IFN-a than IL-29 ( Figure 2 ). Secretion of cytokines and chemokines occurs without the release of a significant amount of infectious viral particles From our previous studies we knew that AM do not release a significant amount of infectious virus particles after infection with human influenza viruses [3, 19] . To investigate whether the infected macrophages were synthesizing viral proteins, we performed a time-course infection experiment in AM from an additional 4 donors using both live ( Figure 3A -D) and UVinactivated PR/8 viruses ( Figure 3E ), examined the kinetics of viral antigen synthesis by staining hemagglutinin (HA) or nucleoprotein, and measured secretion of selected cytokines by ELISA. As shown in Figure 3F , there was a slight increase in viral production at 6 hpi, when about 20% of the cells expressed viral antigens and then no more net increase in viral release as up to 80% of the cells expressed viral proteins by 48 hpi. The viral antigen staining was due to viral replication, since there was no signal with UV-inactivated virus ( Figure 3E ). Despite the abortive release of infectious virus, PR/8 infection induced a time dependent cytokine and chemokine response in human AM ( Figure 3G -K). Viruses triggered an early and rapid secretion of IFN-a and CXCL10 at 6 hpi. Secretion of CCL5 and CXCL8 followed the pattern of the viral protein synthesis increasing with time. The virus-induced increase of TNF-a peaked at 24 hpi and then declined. UV-inactivation abolished the virus-stimulated TNF-a production, significantly decreased secretion of IFN-a, CXCL8, and CCL5. However, the inactive virus was able to stimulate a strong CXCL10 response, although the degree was slightly smaller than that from live PR/8 ( Figure 3I ). The different patterns of the induction suggest that the cytokine response may involve different regulatory mechanisms. In addition, we compared the alterations in mRNA levels of selected innate immune response genes at 3 and 24 hpi for both UV-inactivated PR/8 and live PR/8 infections. Consistent with the protein data, both live and UV-inactivated PR/8 stimulated a large increase in CXCL10 mRNA at both time points. UV-inactivated PR/8 stimulated an up to 4 fold increase of CCL5 and IFNA1. UV-inactivated virus did not alter mRNA levels of RIG-I, TLR7, or ISG56 at either time point (data not shown).

Blockade of the IL-1 receptor by its naturally occurring receptor antagonist IL-1Ra [30] had a similar effect.

This includes a significant induction of cytokines and chemokines, pathogen recognition, and apoptotic responses, which are similar to the responses of human monocyte derived macrophages [16, 17] . Consistent with other studies of avian or human influenza infections in humans and animals [16, 17, [31] [32] [33] , PR/8 stimulated an early and prominent IFN response in human AM despite of the failure to release infectious viral particles. Human AM produce both type I and type III interferons (Figures 1 and 2) . In contrast, alveolar epithelial cells do not produce any type I interferon IFN-a in response to influenza [34] . These results indicate a cell-specific pattern in producing IFN in response to viral infection. It is well known that RIG-I like RNA helicases (RLHs) and TLRs are the two main PRRs responsible for IFN production against RNA viruses including influenza. RLHs (RIG-I and MDA-5) recognize cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA, whereas TLRs (TLR3 and TLR7) sense viral nucleic acid in the endosomal compartment [35, 36] . In the current study, PR/8 infection up-regulated mRNA levels of RIG-I and MDA-5 mainly at 4 hpi, but the mRNAs of TLR3 and 7 mainly at 24 hpi ( Figure 1B) , which suggests that RLHs might be the early sensors and TLRs might be the late sensors for PR/8 in human AM. These results correlate well with those reported by Takeuchi and Thompson that RLHs were responsible for local production of IFNs, whereas TLRs were mainly involved in the late stages of systemic infection [35, 36] . At early times PR/8 triggered mainly pro-inflammatory responses, whereas at later times PR/8 also activated pathways involved in the maintenance of homeostasis such as the activation of IL-10 and IL-6, as well as up-regulation of SOCS genes (Data S1). Therefore, therapeutic regulation of the inflammatory response in acute lung injury should consider both strategies to inhibit secreted cytokines but also strategies to dampen the innate immune response by stimulating IL-10 and SOCS genes. We were able to confirm the results found with PR/8 in contemporary influenza virus NY/238-infected human AM with the exception of an increase in TLR7 mRNA.

The major difference is that alveolar macrophages infected with human influenza viruses do not release much infectious virus, whereas human monocyte-derived macrophages do ( [19, 20] and Figure 3 ). The mechanism for the non-productive infection was not investigated in this study and is likely complicated. One of the possible mechanisms might be related to the lack of gene expression of transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2) and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) by human AM (microarray data not shown). Both TMPRSS2 and HAT are type II transmembrane serine proteases [47] possessing trypsin-like activity and are known to be important for cleaving influenza HA required for productive infection [48] . In recent studies Bottcher et al suggest that TMPRSS2 is mainly responsible for cleavage of newly synthesized HA, whereas HAT cleaves both endocytosed and newly synthesized HA [49] . Therefore, lack of these two gene products in human AM may partially explain the lack of released infectious virus by these cells. In addition, both PR/8 and NY/238 viruses induced an early activation of type I IFN, especially IFN-a (Table 1 and Figures 1,  3, and 4) . The strong anti-viral property of type I IFN [50] may also contribute to the non-productive infection in these cells. Further studies will be required to understand the mechanism for the failure of release of infectious viral particles by human AM. In addition, inactivation of influenza by UV did not abolish the influenza viruses-stimulated CXCL10 secretion by AM (Figures 3  and 4) , which is different from studies with human monocytederived macrophages [21, 51] and with human alveolar type II epithelial cells isolated from the same donors ( [34] and data not shown). In those studies, release of CXCL10 is totally dependent on viral replication. The mechanism for the distinct CXCL10 response in human AM will require additional and carefully designed studies. The differences between human AM and monocyte-derived macrophages indicate the importance of investigating the response of AM to influenza infection during the initial phases of infection in the lung because AM are main targets for both human and avian influenza viruses [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 302, "end": 306, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 307, "end": 310, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 720, "end": 724, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 848, "end": 852, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1035, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1357, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1770, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1774, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2347, "end": 2351, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 323, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1283, "text": "(Table 1 and", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1305, "text": "Figures 1,  3, and 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1692, "text": "(Figures 3  and 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Chemokine and cytokine responses are required for protection of the host against viral infection. However, an exuberant response contributes to the influenza-induced morbidity and mortality, especially in severe pandemic and avian influenza infections [16, 52] . In the current study, PR/8 infection induced an increase in TNF-a and IL-1b, well-known paracrine proinflammatory factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibiting these factors might reduce the influenza-induced-inflammatory response. Since the contemporary virus NY/238 induced a similar cytokine and chemokine response as PR/8, it would be reasonable to expect that the regulation of chemokine and cytokine in contemporary influenza infection might also be similar to PR/8 infection. As shown in Figure 5 , inhibiting TNF and/or IL-1 decreased more than 50% of the PR/8-induced secretion of inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL5 but did not truly affect type I interferon or CXCL10 response, although we observed a decrease of CXCL10 in the presence of both inhibitors ( Figure 5 ). TNF and IL-1 signaling are known to be regulated by NF-kB and there are several NF-kB binding sites in the promoter of CXCL10 [53] , despite of the fact that CXCL10 is an IFN-induced protein [24] . This may explain why inhibiting both pathways slightly decreased the amount of CXCL10 from infected AM. Our results suggest that short term targeting the critical paracrine factors might be beneficial for controlling the excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells and acute lung injury during pandemic or avian flu infection in vivo. Of course, this would require careful consideration of time and dose so as not to increase secondary bacterial infections. Influenza infection significantly decreased mRNA level of macrophage receptors CLEC7A, MSR1, CD36, and MRC1 ( Figure 6A and Table 2 ). CLEC7A belongs to the C-type lectin family and functions as a PRR that recognizes a variety of beta-1, 3-linked and beta-1, 6-linked glucans from fungi. A decrease of CLEC7A in infected AM suggests that these cells might not efficiently recognize and engulf fungi after influenza infection. As shown in Figure 6B , the uptake of zymosan, a yeast cell wall component containing beta-1-3-glycosolic linkeages, was decreased in a dose-dependent manner in PR/8-infected human AM. This effect was not associated with cell loss or cytopathic effect because we did not observe a significant cytopathic effect ( Figure 3B ) even at a MOI of 1 (data not shown). However, the explanation of the decreased uptake might be more complicated than simply the loss of this receptor. In addition, other macrophage receptors MSR1, MARCO, CD36, as well as mannose receptor MRC1 are important for bacterial and particle uptake [54] [55] [56] . Mice with deletions of MSR1 or CD36 have increased susceptibility to pneumococcal or staphylococcal pneumonia [57] [58] [59] . Although impairment of macrophage phagocytosis of bacteria after influenza in mice is well recognized [60, 61] and secondary bacterial infection after influenza is a common clinical problem, we were not able to detect a significant decrease in uptake of heat-inactivated S. aureus in human AM until 72 hpi, at which time the cytopathic effect was significant. We did not observe a consistent decrease of MSR1 protein by flow cytometry in PR/8-infected AM, which might explain why the infection did not impair the bacterial uptake (data not shown). We were also not able to verify the decrease of mRNA level of MARCO, another important macrophage scavenger receptor for influenza infections in mice and human cells [54, 56, 58, 62] . Nine of 11 donors showed a decrease in mRNA levels of MARCO after infection with PR/8 ( Figure 6A ). Two other donors had an increase in levels of MARCO mRNA. Therefore, changes of bacteria-related receptors in human AM after influenza require additional studies, and there may be variations in response among individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 257, "end": 260, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1182, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2755, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2760, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2761, "end": 2765, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2882, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2883, "end": 2887, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2888, "end": 2892, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2997, "end": 3001, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3002, "end": 3005, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 3609, "end": 3613, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3614, "end": 3617, "text": "56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3621, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3622, "end": 3625, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 764, "end": 772, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1048, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1828, "text": "Figure 6A", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1840, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2156, "text": "Figure 6B", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2457, "text": "Figure 3B", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3716, "end": 3725, "text": "Figure 6A", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, we performed a global profiling of innate immune response and regulation with a focus on chemokine and cytokine response in influenza-infected human AM.
