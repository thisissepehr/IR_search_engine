The alveolar size and aspect ratio change with generation number. Due to successive bifurcation, the flow velocity magnitude also decreases as the bronchiole diameter decreases from the upper to lower acini. As a result, fluid dynamic parameters such as Reynolds (Re) and Womersley (a) numbers progressively decrease with increasing generation number. In order to characterize alveolar flow patterns and inhaled particle transport during synchronous ventilation, we have conducted measurements for a range of dimensionless parameters physiologically relevant to the upper acini. Acinar airflow patterns were measured using a simplified in vitro alveolar model consisting of a single transparent elastic truncated sphere (representing the alveolus) mounted over a circular hole on the side of a rigid circular tube (representing the bronchiole). The model alveolus was capable of expanding and contracting inphase with the oscillatory flow through the bronchiole thereby simulating synchronous ventilation. Realistic breathing conditions were achieved by exercising the model over a range of progressively varying geometric and dynamic parameters to simulate the environment within several generations of the acinar tree. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the resulting flow patterns. Next, we used the measured flow fields to calculate particle trajectories to obtain particle transport and deposition statistics for massless and finite-size particles under the influence of flow advection and gravity. Our study shows that the geometric parameters (b and DV/V) primarily affect the velocity magnitudes, whereas the dynamic parameters (Re and a) distort the flow symmetry while also altering the velocity magnitudes. Consequently, the dynamic parameters have a greater influence on the particle trajectories and deposition statistics compared to the geometric parameters.

The alveolus and bronchiole were housed in a sealed, fluid-filled, rectangular chamber which provided the required, refractive index-matched, optical access. The oscillation of the alveolus and the oscillatory flow through the bronchiole were synchronously driven by syringe pumps connected to a stepper motor stage that was computer controlled to provide sinusoidal motion.

In contrast, the fraction of suspended particles is highest for DV/V \u00bc 0.65 for h \u00bc 0 orientation (compare parts (b8) with (b1) and (b7) in Figs. 6 and 7) , and for DV/V \u00bc 0.5 for the other two gravity orientations (compare parts (c1), (d1), with (c7), (d7), and (c8), (d8) in Figs. 6 and 7) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 742, "end": 756, "text": "Figs. 6 and 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 879, "end": 893, "text": "Figs. 6 and 7)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Effect of DV/V on Flow Patterns and Particle"}, {"text": "The greater particle deposition for DV/V \u00bc 0.5 can be attributed to the moderate expansion/contraction which encourages more particles to enter into the alveolus during the first cycle.

In contrast, the small velocities associated with DV/V \u00bc 0.25 are unable to advect a reasonable portion of particles during the first cycle. Consequently, the fraction of suspended particles is smaller and deposition is low. By this argument, the deposition is expected to be higher for DV/V \u00bc 0.65 but in fact, the deposition is small again which can be explained as follows: during transition periods the vortex rings enhance particle transport and deposition into the alveolus. For DV/V \u00bc 0.65, the recirculation region is small because the alveolus is small during transition from exhalation to inhalation (Fig. 5(h) ).

Hence, during a complete breathing cycle, a net inward displacement develops but its magnitude is small. Therefore, more particles remain suspended for a longer duration. Furthermore, the penetration of particles is slow due to the small net inward displacement. The formation of an asymmetric vortex ring during transition from inhalation to exhalation (Fig. 3(d) ) is expected due to history effects from the peak exhalation period, as explained in our previous work [22] . During peak inhalation the shear layer formation is promoted by the alveolar expansion. Consequently, the rapid bronchiole flow (dataset 3, Re \u00bc 0.8) causes a tilt in the peak velocities towards the bronchiole flow direction (right side, Fig.  2(d) ). In contrast, the influence of the bronchiole fluid motion is suppressed by large outward velocities during peak exhalation. 6 Particle maps for d p 5 1.5 lm particles after five cycles for all data sets.

The blue, red, and green boundaries in each subfigure correspond to the alveolar wall location in Figs. 3 and 4, and 5 , respectively. Therefore, the bronchiole fluid is unable to alter the flow inside the alveolus. On the other hand, the flow asymmetry developed during transition from inhalation to exhalation continues to survive until peak exhalation due to a lack of adequate damping ( Fig.  5(d) ). Furthermore, since the peak exhalation is unable to damp out the asymmetry developed during transition from inhalation to exhalation, this asymmetry continues through transition from exhalation to inhalation as observed in Fig. 5(d) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 710, "end": 714, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 595, "end": 605, "text": "(Fig. 3(d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 955, "end": 965, "text": "Fig.  2(d)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1094, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1299, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1482, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1686, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1847, "text": "Figs. 3 and 4, and 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2120, "end": 2130, "text": "Fig.  5(d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2366, "text": "Fig. 5(d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Effect of DV/V on Flow Patterns and Particle"}, {"text": "Particle maps for Re \u00bc 0.1, 0.8, and 0.2 are shown in parts (a2)-(d2), (a3)-(d3), and (a4)-(d4), respectively, in Figs. 6 and 7.

In contrast, more particles remain suspended for Re \u00bc 0.1 due to a lower recirculation in this case ((a2)-(d2) in Figs. 6 and 7) . As Re is increased to 0.8, the velocity field becomes significantly asymmetric during both transition periods (Figs. 3(c) and 5(c)). However, the shear layer remains separated from the vortex rings. Consequently, the shear layer carries away all the particles introduced near the alveolar opening. Hence, particle deposition is lowest for Re \u00bc 0.8 for both massless and d p \u00bc 1.5 lm particles in all three gravity orientations ((a3)-(d3) in Figs. 6 and 7) . However, gravity causes streamline crossing for some particles for the h \u00bc p orientation due to which some particles enter the recirculation region ((b3) in Figs. 6 and 7). Consequently, they remain suspended after 5 and 10 cycles and eventually begin to deposit on alveolar wall after 10 cycles (Fig. 7(b3) ). Similar to Re, the effect of a is clearly noticeable at each time step in the breathing cycle. As a is decreased from 0.42 to 0.15, the vortex rings during transition periods become asymmetric which can be observed by comparing (e) with (d) and (f) in Figs. 3 and 5. Furthermore, the asymmetry is significantly stronger during transition from exhalation to inhalation compared to the other transition period for a \u00bc 0.15 (compare Figs. 3(f) and 5(f)). In fact, during transition from exhalation to inhalation, the left circulation suppresses the right circulation, merges with the shear layer, and occupies almost the entire alveolar volume.

In fact, a \u00bc 0.15 represents 4 and 8 times slower expansion/contraction compared to a 5 0.3 and 0.42, respectively. Consequently, the velocities induced by the alveolar wall motion are significantly smaller for the smaller a value. In contrast, the bronchiole flow for all a remains unchanged (Re \u00bc 0.2). As a result, the bronchiole flow-induced velocities overwhelm velocities caused by the alveolar wall motion and the vortex rings become highly asymmetric. A similar effect causes the largest velocities to shift in the bronchiole flow direction during peak inhalation/ exhalation.

However, higher inhalation velocities in combination with higher recirculation velocities for a \u00bc 0.42 (see (d) and (e) in Figs. 2-5) push more particles into the alveolus resulting in greater particle deposition and a higher fraction of suspended particles ((a4)-(d4), (a5)-(d5) in Figs. 6 and 7) . When a is reduced to 0.15, the overall flow topology changes (compare Figs. 3(f) and 5(f) with 3(d) and 3(e) and 5(d) and 5(e)), i.e., the secondary vortex ring and the shear layer disappear and the primary vortex ring becomes highly asymmetric.
