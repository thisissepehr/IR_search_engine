Studies have confirmed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays important roles in the development and progression of ALI or ARDS. Increased serum endotoxin or LPS of Gram-negative bac-teria can cause pulmonary inflammation leading to ALI and predicts multiple organ failure (MOF), particularly during sepsis [2] . LPS recognition by the host receptor is a critical step leading to the activation of signal transduction cascades in a variety of cells in the lung [3] . Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR4) is required for the innate immune response to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria [4] . Studies have shown that mice with TLR4 gene deletion (TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 ) (C57BL/10ScCr) and mice with a natural point mutation (C3H/HeJ) in the TLR4 gene are unresponsive to system-ic LPS. Although the role of TLR4 in pulmonary inflammation is still debatable, studies have shown that LPS rather than TLR4 is directly involved in the induction of pulmonary immune responses [5] . Furthermore, LPS-induced CD14-dependent and -independent (CD11b-dependent) signaling pathways in the lung are entirely dependent on TLR4 and blocking TLR4 might be beneficial for lung injury caused by LPS from Gram-negative pathogens [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 547, "end": 550, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 701, "end": 704, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 810, "end": 813, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1185, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1425, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Simvastatin, which lowers cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, has been widely prescribed to hyperlipidemic patients at risk for cardiovascular disease [7] .

Therefore, we examined the effect of simvastatin on LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling may occur by a variety of mechanisms, such as the enhanced expression of I\u03baB-\u03b1, which forms an inactive cytoplasmic complex with the p65-p50 heterodimeric complex. The protein levels of I\u03baB-\u03b1 were determined by western blot analysis using specific anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 and anti-phosphorylated I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibodies. Treatment of LPS-stimulated RPMVECs with simvastatin at different concentrations resulted in a related increase in the level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and the reduction of phosphorylated I\u03baB-\u03b1 ( Figure 5A ). Because activation of NF-\u03baB requires I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation, we assessed the effect of simvastatin on the level of phosphorylated I\u03baB-\u03b1. I\u03baB-\u03b1 levels were reduced in RPMVECs, but this reduction was not observed when cells were co-incubated with a high concentration of simvastatin. Furthermore, immunofluores-cence staining showed that LPS-treated RPMVECs accumulated p65 in the nucleus, which was not observed in cells co-incubated with simvastatin and LPS (Table 4 , Figure 5A , B and D), confirming the western blot results. Pretreatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a class of antioxidants reported to be potent inhibitors of NF-\u03baB, and TLR4 interference also inhibited the LPS-induced expression of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS in RP-MVECs ( Figure 5C and Table 5 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 95, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 96, "end": 99, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 693, "end": 702, "text": "Figure 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1167, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1179, "text": "Figure 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1464, "text": "Figure 5C", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1476, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Simvastatin suppresses the LPS-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity"}, {"text": "LPS is a major recognition marker for the detection of Gram-negative bacteria by the host and a powerful initiator of the inflammatory response to infection [18] . Activation of cells by LPS is mediated by TLR4, a member of the highly conserved family of TLR proteins, which are specialized in the recognition of microbial components [15] . Here, we show that simvastatin attenuates the LPS-induced inflammatory response of RPMVECs by down-regulating TLR4 expression. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show that simvastatin blocks LPS-induced inflammation in RPMVECs by downregulating TLR4 gene expression. Furthermore, we showed that simvastatin significantly reduced the inflammatory activation of RPMVECs by inhibiting LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activity. LPS stimulates the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and IL-6 from monocytes and macrophages [19, 20] . These cytokines can further activate monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes, causing cellular injury and tissue damage. Among inflammatory cells, activated alveolar macrophages and infiltrated/activated neutrophils play a major role in airway mucus hypersecretion by releasing various kinds of inflammatory cytokines and proteinases [21] . TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to induce the expression and production of respiratory mucins [22] . IL-8 plays an important role in neutrophil elastase-induced goblet cell metaplasia and Muc5ac production in the airway epithelium [23] . Statins attenuated the infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils) in allergic asthma and in an acute lung injury model, and altered the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in vitro and in vivo [8] . In the present study, simvastatin attenuated LPS-induced TLR4 expression and the release of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in LPS-stimulated RPMVECs. Moreover, the release of inflammatory cytokines was markedly decreased by TLR4 interference. These data suggest that simvastatin inhibits the inflammatory response of RPM-VECs by downregulating TLR4 expression. Simvastatin belongs to a class of cholesterol-lowering statins that are widely used to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with or without coronary artery disease [10] . Simvastatin inhibits acute and chronic inflammatory responses in a cholesterolindependent manner by interfering with endothelial adhesion and leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation [24] . In rats with normal blood cholesterol levels, simvastatin ameliorated immunopathology in an acute TNBS colitis model by blocking neutrophil accumulation in the small intestine and lowering serum TNF-\u03b1 levels [25] . Although the anti-inflammatory potential of statins has been demonstrated in several studies, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of airway inflammation by statins has not been fully elucidated [26] . Several possible mechanisms of action may explain the effect of statins on the reduction of inflammation including the modulation of cholesterol content and the prevention of the prenylation of signaling molecules and the subsequent down-regulation of gene expression. Statin-sensitive signaling molecules include Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), MAPK and Akt. RhoA and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are important mediators of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production (e.g. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8) and TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory damage. Moreover, RhoA acts upstream of MAPK in an LPS-activated pathway [27] . RhoA expression and p38 phosphorylation levels were shown to be positively correlated with the concentration of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in BALF, and the expression of Muc5ac mRNA in the lung [28] . Here, we showed that the LPS-induced inflammatory response of RPMVECs is mediated by the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and simvastatin attenuates the LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, thereby decreasing inflammatory cytokine production and inflammation in RPMVECs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 334, "end": 338, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 917, "end": 921, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 922, "end": 925, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1265, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1355, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1492, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1750, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2314, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2508, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2719, "end": 2723, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2925, "end": 2929, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3539, "end": 3543, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3755, "end": 3759, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our results indicate that simvastatin inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory response of RPMVECs by downregulating TLR4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels.
