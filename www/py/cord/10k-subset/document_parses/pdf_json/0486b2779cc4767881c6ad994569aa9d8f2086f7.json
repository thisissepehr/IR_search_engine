They are essential for the production of livestock products such as milk and meats. The production efficiency of livestock products is negatively impacted by infection with zoonotic pathogens. To prevent and control infectious diseases, it is important to understand the interaction between cattle tissue and pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we established an in vitro infection model of an immortalized bovine colon-derived epithelial cell line by transducing the cells with lentiviral vectors containing genes encoding cell cycle regulators cyclin D1, mutant cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The established cell line showed continuous cell proliferation, expression of epithelial markers, and an intact karyotype, indicating that the cells maintained their original nature as colon-derived epithelium. Furthermore, we exposed the established cell line to two strains of Salmonella enterica and EHEC. Interestingly, S. Typhimurium showed higher affinity for the established cell line and invaded the cytoplasm than S. Enteritidis. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that gene expression of Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), TLR 2 and TLR 3, whereas TLR 4, 5 and 6 were not detectable in established cells.

The efficiency of their production is largely affected by various zoonotic pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 [1] and Salmonella enterica [2] . Infection can be established by a variety of routes, including fecal contamination of feed, or transmission from humans or wild animals. Many pathogens in cattle are living as commensal bacteria at the mucosal surface without invading the reservoir host, however, exponential growth of the bacteria and invasion into the intestinal epithelial cells are critical steps to establish infection in infected animals. An in vitro cell culture system is essential for molecular studies of bacterial affinity for epithelial cells. However, as far as we know, intestinal cell lines from cattle are not available from worldwide cell banks such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Bacterial adhesion and invasion are detectable using relatively simple methods such as fluorescent immunohistochemical staining [3] .

Furthermore, the expression of these oncogenic proteins can change the original nature of the primary cells.

Primary cells cannot proliferate indefinitely due to cellular senescence. As a solution to this limitation, we introduced human Cyclin D1, mutant CDK4, and TERT. The version of CDK4 we transfected has a mutation (R24C) at the binding site for the senescence protein p16. When a normal cell is exposed to cellular stress, or reaches the senescence point, p16 protein accumulates in the cells [25, 26] . The p16 protein binds to CDK4 and negatively regulates the activity of CDK4-Cyclin D1 complex. However, p16 cannot suppress the CDK4R24C-Cyclin D1 complex. Due to the constitutive activity of the CDK4R24C-Cyclin D1 complex, phosphorylation and inactivation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is maintained, resulting in an accelerated rate of cell growth. This method of cell immortalization was initially reported in humans [9] , and we previously reported that this immortalization method could be applied to a wide variety of animals, since CDK4 and Cyclin D1 are evolutionally conserved [11, 12] . In the present study, we established a BFCE-K4DT cell line, derived from bovine fetal colon epithelial cells via transfection of three genes, human Cyclin D1, mutant CDK4, and telomerase. This cell line showed an accelerated speed of cell proliferation and kept on proliferating after stopping its growth in BFCE-Primary cells (passage number = 5) as a result of the expression of these three genes.

Thus, tight junction of BFCE-K4DT cells is not strong even when cells are confluence. Furthermore, BFCE-primary cells were also not strong expression levels of these epithelial markers in the cell-to-cell contact region, which suggests that this feature was not caused by the method in this study but the native character. Furthermore, SEM analysis in this study revealed surface of BFCE-K4DT cells (Fig 6C) , and we could not recognized rough and slender microvilli-like structure observed in other research reported [22] even when we maintained BFCE-K4DT cells for 1 week after confluency in the culture (data not shown), but microvilli-like projections were detectable (Fig 6Cc) . It was known one of the reasons why a loss of the epithelial characteristics including cell-to-cell junction is caused by epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [27] resulting from cell disaggregation during the period of epithelial [29] . We sought to establish the new cell line because the expression of these oncogenic proteins could lead to change the original nature of the primary cells. These observations suggested that further challenges are necessary to understand the flexible and dynamic cell environments by using various types of cell lines, and established BFCE-K4DT cells could be a valuable tool. Salmonellosis is an important disease of cattle, most often caused by S. Dublin and S. Typhimurium. S. Typhimurium is frequently detected in calves around 2 months of age, in which it induces diarrhea [30] [31] [32] and also infect a wide range of domesticated or wild animals, as well as humans [33] . S. Enteritidis is most often isolated from chickens and eggs [34] , and is also one of the major causes of human food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide [35] . Interestingly, many S. Typhimurium were detected as intense dots of positive staining when added to BFCE-K4DT cells, which was explained as the presence of the bacterium in the cytoplasm of the cells. However, S. Enteritidis did not show any intense positive signals in the cytoplasm, indicating a difference in the ability of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis to invade bovine colon epithelium. Furthermore, Gentamycin protection assay revealed that the numbers of invasive S. Enteritidis were smaller than that of S. Typhimurium in support of immunofluorescent staining despite higher dose of Salmonella than Fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Previous study revealed that there are differential immune responses to S. Typhimulium, S. Dublin, and S. Enteritidis in bovine peripheral blood leukocytes [36] . These suggests that this detected difference of invasion number between S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis might account for their distinct host infection associations and can be a possible factor of immune response differentiation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 722, "end": 726, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1126, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1709, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1714, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1719, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1804, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1872, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1957, "end": 1961, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2765, "end": 2769, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 603, "end": 611, "text": "(Fig 6C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 876, "end": 885, "text": "(Fig 6Cc)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) contribute to host resistance to microbial pathogens, and each TLR bind targets as microbial ligands, such as tri-acylated lipopeptide (TLR 1), lipoprotein (TLR 2), double strand RNA (TLR 3), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR 4), flagellin (TLR 5) and Di-acyl lipopeptide (TLR 6) [37, 38] . In this research, we could detect the TLR 1, TLR 2 and TLR 3, but not TLR 4, TLR 5 and TLR 6. On the other hand, Bridger et al. have reported that bovine primary colonic cells established by them harbored mRNA specific for TLR 1, TLR 3, TLR 4 and TLR 6 [19] . These results show there are differences of expressing TLR genes among bovine colonic cells, and new bovine colon cell line establishment will lead to an opportunity for deeper understanding of the interactions between pathogenic bacteria and bovine host. TLR 2 mediates cellular responses to various infectious pathogens and their products including yeast cell walls, whole mycobacteria, peptidoglycan [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . TLR 2 activities for recognition of these ligands, however, are known to complex other TLRs, such as TLR 1 and TLR 6 [45] . Q-RTPCR showed TLR 1 and TLR 2 were transcribed in BFCE-K4DT cells, so that this cell line is a useful model for investigation of the interaction between infectious pathogens and TLR 1/2 heterodimer complex. Although established BFCE-K4DT cell did not show gene expression TLR 6, they could be useful in vitro model for discussing about interaction with TLR 2 and the downstream signaling of TLR 2/6 heterodimer complex. Tabeta et al. have reported that TLR3 deficient mice are hyper-susceptible to mouse cytomegalovirus infection, which indicates TLR3 has a protective role against viral infection [45] . TLR3 is expressed in cell endosomal compartments can recognize viral nucleic acids [46] . Established BFCE-K4DT cells are expressing TLR3, thus this cells are suitable for the study accompanied with not only bacterial infection but also viral infection. In this study, TLR 4 playing a key role in the recognition of LPS and TLR 5 that is triggering cardiac innate immune responses and causing acute contractile dysfunction when combined with its ligand flagellin [47] were not detectable. Thus, established cells can be considered pathways via these receptors' ligand were inactivated, such as MyD88-and TIRAP-dependent pathways [48] . TLRs-deficient mice were developed to examine the role of TLRs in vivo [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .
