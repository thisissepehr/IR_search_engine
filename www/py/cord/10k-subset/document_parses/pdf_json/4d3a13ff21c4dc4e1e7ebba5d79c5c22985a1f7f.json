Compared with nonsmokers' cells, smokers' macrophages produced significantly more virus during in vitro infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-l). Exposure of macrophages to either antiviral macrophage-activating factor or interferon-y for 20 hr before infection resulted in diminished production of HSV-l by both types of macrophages. However, in contrast to smokers' cells, exposure of nonsmokers' macrophages to these antivirallymphokines totally prevented viral replication. This difference could not be attributed to diminished adsorption of virus to smokers' macrophages or to an increased proportion of extracellular to intracellular virus in smokers' cell cultures. The effect of smoking on viral infectivity did not appear to be mediated by secretion of a soluble factor by the macrophage because incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatant from smokers' cell cultures did not affect the growth of HSV-l.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Cigarette smoking increases both the risk and severity of viral infection of the respiratory tract.

This virus may also be a cause of serious pneumonitis in immunosuppressed individuals [32, 33] .

Human pulmonary macrophages from smokers had diminished responses to macrophage migration-inhibitory factor [44] . These functional alterations may be based on metabolic or structural changes in macrophages produced by exposure to tobacco smoke. For instance, macrophage levels of the energy-generating enzymes adenosine triphosphatase [45] and glucose-3phosphate dehydrogenase [46] are diminished in smokers' cells and may be responsible for lowered rates of phagocytosis observed in smokers' macrophages. Similarly, smoking-related ultrastuctural changes, consisting of increased blebs and lamellipodia, in the macrophage plasma membrane have been implicated in altered pinocytosis and endocytosis [27] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 221, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 227, "end": 231, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 265, "end": 269, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 546, "end": 550, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 774, "end": 778, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 816, "end": 820, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1142, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although in the present studies we did not elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for increased infectivity and diminished lymphokine response in smokers' macrophages, these alterations could not be explained by increased release of intracellular virus into culture medium during infection (table 3) or by differences between the optimal concentration of lymphokine needed to produce an antiviral state in smokers' and nonsmokers' cells (table 1) .

This conclusion is in contrast to a previous study that found only a small size difference in these cell populations on the basis of direct measurement of cell diameter [28] . This method of assessing cell size could underestimate true cell volume compared with measurements of cellular protein concentration. By the latter method smokers' cells appeared nearly twice as large as nonsmokers' cells. On a per cell basis, smokers' macrophages are exposed to more than twice the amount of adsorbed virus as are nonsmokers' cells (table 2) .
