It was found that synonymous codon and amino acid usage of PhiKZ was distinct from that of P. aeruginosa. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, the third codon position of the synonymous codons of PhiKZ carries mostly A or T base; codon usage bias in PhiKZ is dictated mainly by mutational bias and, to a lesser extent, by translational selection. A cluster analysis of the relative synonymous codon usage values of 16 myoviruses including PhiKZ shows that PhiKZ is evolutionary much closer to Escherichia coli phage T4. Further analysis reveals that the three factors of mean molecular weight, aromaticity and cysteine content are mostly responsible for the variation of amino acid usage in PhiKZ proteins, whereas amino acid usage of P. aeruginosa proteins is mainly governed by grand average of hydropathicity, aromaticity and cysteine content. Based on these observations, we suggest that codons of the phage-like PhiKZ have evolved to preferentially incorporate the smaller amino acid residues into their proteins during translation, thereby economizing the cost of its development in GC-rich P. aeruginosa.",

            "text": "Multivariate statistical analysis CA, one of the multivariate statistical techniques, has been widely used to study the codon usage variation between genes in different organisms. In this analysis, the data are plotted in a multidimensional space of 59 axes (excluding Met, Trp and stop codons), then the most prominent axes are determined that contribute to the codon usage variation among the genes. In the present study, RSCU values have been used for CA in order to minimize the amino acid composition. Fig. 1 shows the distributions of PhiKZ genes on the first two major axes of the correspondence analysis. The first major axis accounted for 11.25% of the total variation and the second major axis accounted for 6.59% of the total variation. The position of the genes along the first major axis is negatively correlated with A 3s (r=\u22120.756, P<0.01) and T 3s (r=\u22120.363, P<0.01). It is also interesting to note that the position of the genes along the first major axis is positively correlated with N c (r=0.151, P<0.01), C 3s (r=0.780, P<0.01), G 3s (r=0.425, P<0.01) and GC 3s (r=0.762, P<0.01). From these results one can reasonably postulate that A and T-ending codons might be preferred codons in the presumably highly expressed genes. It is also Table 1 Overall codon usage analysis in PhiKZ and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA, amino acid; HEG, PhiKZ-specific highly expressed (N c <30) genes; LEG, lowly expressed (N c >50) genes; PA, P. aeruginosa; RSCU, relative synonymous codon usage. Codons of P. aeruginosa which are recognized by two or more of its tRNAs have been considered optimal here. that out of 17 codons that are statistically over-represented in genes located on the extreme left side of axis 1, there are 9 A-ending codons, 7 T-ending codons, and 1 G-ending codon. This actually represents 52.94% A-ending, 41.17% T-ending, and 5.88% G-ending codons. All the preferred T-ending codons in the presumably highly expressed genes are present in duet and isoleucine amino acids, whereas all the preferred A-ending codons in the presumably highly expressed genes are present in all synonymous codon families plus isoleucine ( Table 2) . Surprisingly, for the two-codon family amino acids we found significant negative correlations between the positions of genes along the first major axis and both A 3s (r=\u22120.333, P<0.01) and T 3s (r=\u22120.631, P<0.01). This suggests that in the duets of presumably highly expressed genes, A-ending and Tending codons are predominant. Calculation of correlation coefficients between A 3s (r=\u22120.563, P<0.01), C 3s (r=0.544, P<0.01), G 3s (r=0.374, P<0.01) and the positions of genes along the first major axis in the four-codon family amino acids indicate that in the quartets of presumably highly expressed genes, A-ending codons are predominant. But there is no significant correlation with T 3s . Therefore it is fair to say that T-ending codons are predominant in presumably highly expressed genes and present in duet amino acids. Relationship between N c and G 3s Wright suggested that a plot of N c versus GC 3s could effectively be used to explore the codon usage variation among the genes [28] . As demonstrated by Wright, the comparison of actual distribution of genes with the expected distribution under no selection pressure could be indicative if codon usage bias of genes has some other influences other than mutational bias. If the codon usage bias is completely dictated by GC 3s , the values of N c should fall on the expected curve between GC 3s and N c . In other words, if codon usage bias is completely dictated by GC 3s composition, the difference between observed and expected N c values should be very small in the majority of genes. To explore the possible influence of natural selection and mutational bias on synonymous codon usage on the PhiKZ genome, we calculated (N cExpected \u2212N cObserved )/N cExpected . The frequency distributions of (N cExpected \u2212N cObserved )/N cExpected shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the majority of genes have large deviation of N cObserved from N cExpected .

Very recently, evident that the positions of the genes along the second major axis is positively correlated with A 3s (r=0.143, P<0.01) and T 3s (r=0.540, P<0.01), but negatively correlated with C 3s (r=\u22120.364, P<0.01), G 3s (r=\u22120.538, P<0.01), GC 3s (r=\u22120.487, P<0.01), and N c (r=\u22120.159, P<0.01). Taken together, the results clearly indicate that G-and C-ending codons are clustered on the positive side, whereas A-and T-ending codons are predominant on the negative side of the first major axis. Highly biased genes are generally highly expressed [6, 31] , as there is no information available regarding the gene expression level of PhiKZ, we have considered highly biased genes as highly expressed. Moreover, since there exists a significant positive correlation between axis 1 and N c , we putative categorized the genes into two parts, highly or lowly expressed genes, according to the positions of the genes at the two extreme ends of the first major axis. To investigate the differences between the two clusters of genes distributed along the first axis, the codon usage in 10% of the genes located at the extreme right of axis 1 have been compared with that of the 10% of the genes located at the extreme left of axis 1. To estimate the codon usage variation between these two sets of genes, we have performed chi-squared tests taking P<0.01 as significant criterion. Table 2 shows RSCU values for each codon for the two groups of genes. The asterisk represents the codons whose occurrences are significantly higher in the genes situated on the extreme left side of axis 1, compared with the genes present on the extreme right of the first major axis. It is important to note it was reported that in mycobacteriophages also, codon usage bias is mainly dictated by mutational pressure [33, 34] .",

As it was shown that cellular tRNA abundance in some organisms is directly proportional to the copy number of tRNA [39, 40] , the resulting copy number of tRNA species PhiKZ was compared with that of P. aeruginosa ( Table 1 ). It was found that among the 26 over-represented synonymous codons in highly expressed genes of PhiKZ, only 10 codons could be recognized by the abundant tRNA species of P. aeruginosa. In contrast, 11 out of the 32 over-represented codons of the lowly expressed genes of PhiKZ are also recognized by the abundant tRNA species of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, PhiKZ-specific tRNAs also recognize two more over-represented codons of the highly expressed genes and three more over-represented codons of the lowly expressed genes. Taken together, the data in Table 1 indicate that the putative highly expressed genes of PhiKZ are expressed a little more preferentially than putative lowly expressed genes by the abundant host tRNAs as well as by its own tRNAs. The fact that the influence of abundant tRNAs of P. aeruginosa on the synonymous codon usage of the highly expressed genes of PhiKZ is not strong enough in comparison with what has been demonstrated for the phage T4-Escherichia coli system [32] . One possible explanation for the above observation may be that in P. aeruginosa, copy number of the tRNAs recognizing the synonymous codons decreased in a manner similar to that of other GC-rich bacterium such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis [40] .",

To test this hypothesis and to understand the correlation among the phages of the Myoviridae family, a cluster analysis was carried out on the overall codon usage data of 16 representative myoviruses including PhiKZ by using simple D-squared statistic method. D-squared statistic is the sum of the square of the difference between codons of the two codon usage tables; that is, D 2 is the sum of 64 codons of [Frequency (codon, table 1) \u2212Frequency (codon, table 2) ] 2 . A low value of D 2 indicates a very close similarity in the codon usage. A matrix containing the D 2 value of each set has been used to produce a clustering. The clustering produced by unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) method [41] shows that there are mainly two branches, \"a\" and \"b\", for the 16 phages of the Myoviridae family (Fig. 3) . Mycobacteriophage Bxz1 has been clustered in branch \"a\", whereas the rest of the phages have been clustered in branch \"b\". The phages T4, PhiKZ and LP65 are clustered in a distinct sub-branch \"c\" and the sub-branch \"d\" carries the remaining 12 phages. This type of distribution demonstrates that the synonymous codon usage pattern is not 100% identical even among the phages of each branch and there is a statistically significant difference in the codon usage pattern between the phages of different branches and sub-branches. The data also suggest that PhiKZ is evolutionarily closer to E. coli phage T4, whereas mycobacteriophage Bxz1 has a completely different codon usage pattern from the rest 15 phages of the Myoviridae family (Fig. 3) .",

Further analysis showed that while the first major axis is significantly correlated with Cys content (r=\u22120.175, P<0.01), the second axis is significantly correlated with grand average of hydropathicity (r=0.898, P<0.01) and the aromaticity (r=0.447, P<0.01) of each P. aeruginosa protein (data not shown). The data suggest that amino acid usage of PhiKZ is also distinct from that of its host P. aeruginosa.",

To grow in a genomically distant host, a phage like PhiKZ must evolve its genome in such a way that it can synthesize its proteins easily. From the above codon and amino acid usage analyses, it is conspicuous that codons of the protein coding genes of PhiKZ have been shaped to incorporate predominantly the smaller amino acid residues into their proteins during translation in P. aeruginosa. This type of genomic architecture possibly helps PhiKZ to economize the cost of its development in P. aeruginosa.",
