            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are a subset of dendritic cells, which are found in circulation and other organs. They are distinguished by their capacity to produce copious amounts of type I interferons (IFN) 1,2 via stimulation of Toll like receptor 7 and 9 with nucleic acids or viruses. Because of this property, they play a crucial role in fighting viral infections. 1, 2 However, the cytokine secretion by PDCs is not restricted to IFNs as they can also secrete other cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-12, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL3, and CCL4. Similar to conventional myeloid DCs, they also express MHC Class II and costimulatory molecules and migrate to prime T cell responses. 3, 4 Production of type I IFNs along with IL-12 by PDCs primes CD8+ T cells and IFN-\u03b3 secreting Th1 CD4+ T cells. PDCs can also induce T regulatory cells via induction expression of IDO. 3, 4 In addition, type I IFN production by PDCs enhances B cell activation, plasma cell generation and antibody secretion. TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and granzyme B serve as immunoregulatory factors that endow PDCs with the capacity to kill tumor cells, induce apoptosis of infected CD4 + T cells and suppress T cell proliferation. 3, 4 PDCs also play an important role in pulmonary immune responses. PDCs in the lung have been reported to be immature, expressing low levels of MHC II and costimulatory molecules but high levels of PDL-1. 5 These characteristics make them poor inducers of T cells and that is why they are thought to play an immune-regulatory role in the lung. Depletion of PDCs in a mouse model of asthma enhanced the inflammation against harmless antigens. Similarly, in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), activated PDCs are protective and have been shown to prevent recruitment of pro-inflammatory monocytes into the lung. 6 In contrast, PDCs were reported to be key drivers of immune-inflammatory cascade during asthma exacerbations via boosting of Th2 responses. 7 Thus, PDCs can be inflammatory or tolerogenic depending on the context. Activated PDCs are major drivers of protection against respiratory infections such as influenza and RSV by virtue of production of type I IFNs and other cytokines. 4 The functions of lung DC are influenced by many soluble factors such as growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines that are released from different cells within the lung. These soluble factors regulate the intensity and duration of immune response by stimulating or inhibiting activation and function of DC. For example, previous studies from our group and others have demonstrated that PBECs enhance the inflammatory and immune-surveillance capacity of mDCs. [8] [9] [10] However, their effect on PDCs is not elucidated. This knowledge is essential for manipulation of PDC response to respiratory pathogens. Here we examined the changes introduced in human PDCs by primary bronchial epithelial cells at gene and functional level.",

The access method of Illumina is based on sequence specific capture of coding RNA. This method is suitable for wide range of RNA quality and low RNA input. Briefly, 50 ng of RNA was used for library preparation. The total RNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cation at 98 o C. Then cDNA is synthesized using the cleaved RNA fragments using random priming during the first and the second synthesis. Sequencing adaptors are ligated to the dscDNA fragments. The quality of libraries was assessed after the first PCR amplification. The coding regions of the transcriptome are then captured from the library using sequence specific probes to create the final libraries (as described by the manufacturer). Samples were assayed after the second PCR amplification on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Qualification assay (qPCR) was performed using KAPA SYBR Fast Library Quantification Kit (Illumina) Universal qPCR Mix ref # 0796014001. Samples were sequenced at 2 \u00d7 100 cycle at the UCI high throughput genomic core facility (https://biochemghtfuci.wordpress.com/). Sequencing reads were aligned to genome reference files from Ensembl using Strand NGS 3.1 (http://www.strand-ngs.com/) sequencing analysis package. Approximately 70-90% of mapped reads were aligned to protein coding regions as shown by the pie chart plot (Supplementary fig.1 ). Reads were filtered on duplicates to remove PCR artifacts. Reads with better mapping quality and base average were retained (we set the number of duplicated reads to be permitted at \"0\") (Excel supplementary data). Deduplicated sequencing reads for each sample was quantified for gene expression, which is the measurement of the association of reads to genes and exons \"raw reads\". To normalize the raw reads we used Reads Per Kilo Million (RPKM) method in Strand NGS program. We measured the variations in 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 end coverage along each transcript using gene body coverage analysis in Strand NGS. Uniform transcript coverage was observed among all samples. Pooled analysis was performed using the Audic Claverie Test (AC), which pools together raw counts across four PDCs and PDCs co-cultured with epithelial cells, separately, and tests the differences between them based on a Poisson assumption on distribution of counts. Multiple Testing Correction: Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 0.05 and the maximum p value cut off 0.05 was used (Excel supplementary data). The genes of AC test were ranked based on p value adjusted (FDR corrected) and cut off was set at p adj <0.001 to select for statistically significant differentially expressed genes between the PDCs co-cultured with epithelial cells and PDCs.",

To investigate the effect of AECs in the form of PBECs on PDCs, the PBECS were cultured at ALI till differentiation was achieved. PDCs purified from the blood were then added to the basal side of the monolayer to model the airways. 13, 14 An aliquot of the PDCs was also cultured without PBECs but with the media. Twenty-four later PDCs were collected and RNA was extracted. PDCs from four different individuals were used. The description is provided in supplementary Table 1 . The viability was comparable between PDCs cultured with and without PBECs (data not shown). Because of the low quantity of RNA, we used the access method of library construction from Illumina, which is based on sequence specific capture of coding RNA. This method is suitable for wide range of RNA quality and low RNA input. Paired end RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to determine the gene expression differences between PDC and PDCs co-cultured with epithelial cells. We observed a uniform reads coverage in the gene body for all RNA seq data plot. We did not observe very large increases or decreases in transcript abundance, which was to be expected because PDCs were exposed to PBECs and there was no stimulation with a pathogen.",

Our results indicate that the major pathways altered in PDCs in response to PBECs are the type I IFN related pathways such as the type I IFN signaling, Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), cytosolic sensors of DNA as well as JAK-STAT (Fig. 2a-d) . In the type I IFN pathway, the expression of IFNAR1 as well as JAK-STAT genes such as JAK1, STAT2, STAT3, which signify activation, are upregulated while SOCS1-and 3, which inhibit the pathway, are downregulated ( Fig. 2a-d) . 17 Furthermore pathways involved in the interferon response such as ISG15 also displayed alterations after co-culture (Fig. 2b) . Among the innate sensors, the expression of cytosolic DNA sensor, ZBP-1 18 was upregulated on PDCs after co-culture with APCs (Fig. 2c) . The expression of IRF-3 and NFKB2, which are required for signaling via this receptor, was also upregulated. In contrast, the negative regulators of the pathway, NFKB1a, IKBKB are downregulated. Interestingly, the majority of the genes in the prostaglandin pathway which is a major negative regulator of IFN production were downregulated (Fig. 2e) . In addition to IFN related pathways, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway also displayed major changes in PDCs co-cultured with PBECs compared to PDCs (Fig. 2f) . Several of the chemokine receptor genes, such as CCR4, CCR5, CCR7, CCR10, CX3CR1, CXCR4 were upregulated indicating an activated state of PDCs. Genes in the IL-3 pathway also displayed changes (Fig. 2g) . IL-3 is known to promote PDC activation and survival. 19 In summary, RNA seq data suggests that the capacity of PDCs to produce and amplify type I IFN production is upregulated in PDCs after co-culture with PBECs.",

Purified PDCs were cultured in the presence or absence of these cocktails and activated with influenza. Culture of PDCs with combination cocktail as well as growth factor cocktail enhanced the secretion of type I IFN while the cytokine, chemokine cocktail had no significant effect (supplementary fig. 2 ). Further experiments were then done with growth factors. We tested the individual effects of the growth factors to determine whether this was due to a single factor or a synergistic effect of all 3 factors. Both GCSF (p = 0.03), GMCSF (p = 0.04) led to increase in type I IFN secretion by PDCs in the response to influenza (Fig. 5a) . The increase by VEGF was not significant (p = 0.1). The secretion of type I IFN was maximal when a cocktail of all three growth factors was used indicating a synergistic effect.

The RNA-seq data did not display significant changes in pathways known to induce IFN secretion in PDCs such as the IRF7. 23 However, increased NFkB related genes may play a role in TLRdependent IFN production. 24, 25 Interestingly, PGE2 has been reported to be a negative regulator of type I IFN secretion by human DCs upon stimulation with TLRs 26 and prostaglandin pathway was downregulated in PDCs exposed to PBECs (Fig. 2e) . The expression of another gene, Fc\u025bRI\u03b3/FCE1A is significantly downregulated in PDCs co-cultured with PBECs and it has been demonstrated to inhibit TLR mediated type I IFN production in human PDCs via ITAM-mediated signals. 27 Similarly SOCS1, a key negative regulator of MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling 28, 29 is also downregulated in PBECs exposed PDCs. In addition to negative regulators, PDCs co-cultured with also PBECs displayed increased expression of genes involved in type-I-IFN signaling. Type I IFN can act both in an autocrine and a paracrine manner. 30 It can amplify its own secretion via autocrine actions. Increased expression of IFNAR1 would enhance the autocrine action of IFNs. Therefore, PBECs seem to prime PDCs to enhance type I IFN secretion. This is supported by the increase in the genes of the ISG15 pathway. ISG15 is not only an interferon response pathway 31 but is also reported to bind to IRF-3 and enhance IFN responses. 32, 33 Furthermore, ISG15 pathway can also affect important signaling pathways such as IFN, NF\u03baB, and JNK pathways, all of, which are upregulated in PDCs after exposure to PBECs. 34 Together the gene expression changes suggest that PBECs enhance the capacity of PDCs to produce type I IFN via inhibiting the negative regulators as well as by enhancing the expression of molecules, which can amplify the production of type I IFNs. We had observed similar priming of mDCs by PBECs earlier. 8, 35 Even though RNA-seq data suggests that PDCs cocultured with PBECs express type I IFN at homeostasis, we were unable to detect type I IFN in our supernatants without stimulation with influenza. This could be due to lack of sensitivity of the ELISA which may not be able to detect the various type I IFN subtypes. It is also possible that the type I IFN is bound to the receptor and therefore not detectable. High level of type I IFN secretion in the absence of infection is not desirable since its upregulation under such conditions is usually associated with autoimmunity. The tolerogenic nature of PDCs at homeostasis may therefore prevent secretion of the type I IFN to prevent inflammation. It is also possible that the changes visible at gene level are not transcribed to proteins as it is well established that only about 40% of genes are transcribed to proteins. This is especially true for cytokines.",

Some of the growth factors have already been reported to modulate DC function. For example, knockdown of GCSF receptor in DCs has been reported to reduce the expression of at least proinflammatory cytokines and antigen presenting molecules, while the expression of PDL1 and PDL2 was increased. 36 GMCSF is also considered as a DC activation agent 37 and has been demonstrated to enhance the IFN-\u03b1 production from PDCs in lupus patients. 38 Moreover, GMCSF secretion by kidney epithelial cells has also been reported to enhance maturation and type I IFN production in PDCs. 39 Additionally, GMCSF has been shown to synergize with TLR-dependent microbial stimuli to upregulate of proinflammatory cytokines. 40 Interestingly, BDCA-4, which functions as a marker for PDCs is a receptor on endothelial and tumor cells for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). 41 Studies examining the effect of VEGF on lung DC subtypes in VEGF-transgenic mice have reported an increase in lung mDC and PDC populations. 42 An increase in inflammatory responses of mDC was also reported in the same study.
