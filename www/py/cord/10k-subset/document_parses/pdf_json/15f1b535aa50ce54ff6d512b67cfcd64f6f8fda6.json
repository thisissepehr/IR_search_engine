Sore throats are most commonly due to infections, many of which are viral and do not require specific treatment. Symptoms and signs of the common cold, influenza or croup, the occurrence of conjunctivitis in some adenoviral infections, generalised lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in glandular fever or the presence of vesicles characteristic of herpangina (Coxsackie A virus) or of herpes simplex infection, occasionally enable a clinical diagnosis and avoid the need for antibiotic therapy.

Associated atypical pneumonia suggests infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae. Pharyngitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae may be accompanied by infection at other sites or by other sexually transmitted diseases. Candidal infection, in the appropriate clinical circumstance, should suggest HIV infection. Surgical drainage is required in the case of peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. Noninfectious cases of sore throat, e.g. thyroiditis, are .relatively uncommon considerations in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile pharyngitis. The most common problem is to recognise streptococcal pharyngitis, which requires antibiotic treatment for 10 days to avoid the risk of rheumatic fever. The most common causes of sore throat are infections primarily involving the pharynx. Pain is aggravated by swallowing and may radiate along the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve to the ears. Associated features commonly include rhinorrhoea, cough, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar enlargement, pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate ( fig. 1 ) and fever. Although the symptoms and signs of pharyngitis are usually self-limiting within a few days they are among the most common reasons for seeking medical attention. This is a sensible precaution on the part of patients since a minority of sore throats are due to treatable lifethreatening diseases (diphtheria, acute epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess), are a warning of potential but preventable rheumatic fever (streptococcal pharyngitis), or a symptom of infectious mononucleosis which may run a relatively protracted course. Some patients will have put themselves at risk of contracting gonococcal pharyngitis, in others Candida oropharyngo-oesophagitis may be a manifestation of AIDS and in a few, noninfectious causes of pain such as tumours, foreign bodies, cricoarytenoid arthritis and thyroiditis may \u00b7 be diagnosed. The challenge for the physician is to recognise the minority of sore throats which require treatment given that up to 90% of patients will have viral infections. This is not easy as pathognomonic clinical features of treatable infections are exceptional and laboratory diagnosis is time-consuming and costly because of the numbers involved.",

The principal differential diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis and clues outside the oropharynx generally allow these illnesses to be distinguished from one another. A mucopurulent nasal discharge and crusting of the nares may be seen with diphtheria. The pharyngeal membrane in diphtheria may cover the uvula and its extension to involve the larynx may produce hoarseness and stridor. Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy is usual and occasionally painful: inflammatory oedema produces a classic 'bull-neck' appearance. Evidence of myocarditis and peripheral neuritis should be sought. Haematological and biochemical findings are nonspecific.",
