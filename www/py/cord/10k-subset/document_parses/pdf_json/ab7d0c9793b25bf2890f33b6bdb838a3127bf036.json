We investigate in a model with susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) humans and susceptible (U) and infected (V) mosquitoes in how far the fast time scale of the mosquito epidemiology can be slaved by the slower human epidemiology, so that for the understanding of human disease data mainly the dynamics of the human time scale is essential and only slightly perturbed by the mosquito dynamics. This analysis of the SIRUV model is qualitatively in agreement with a previously investigated simpler SISUV model, hence a feature of vector-borne diseases in general.",

Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are vector-borne diseases caused by an arbovirus with 4 serotypes, which infects millions of people every year in tropical and subtropical areas. The main vector of the disease is the mosquito Aedes aegypti which is well adapted to live in human environments. This mosquito species lives in tropical and subtropical areas, but it is spreading its habitat thanks to the global changes and also the globalization of the humans societies. The fast spreading that has been observed in recent years is expanding the risk areas so, in order to avoid new outbreaks, research interest is increasing to prevent disease spreading by e.g. vaccine development and modelling and predicting the spread of disease.",
