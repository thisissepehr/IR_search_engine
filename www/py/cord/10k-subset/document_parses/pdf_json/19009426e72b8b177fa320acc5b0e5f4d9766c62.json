The value of statistical information for improving health policies is thoroughly discussed in Egidi and Buratta (2006) . Our aim is to show the more relevant sources for evaluating health, morbidity and mortality at the individual level. Many references are given to the Nordic countries, as their data sources are among the best available, but the present paper also refers to a variety of innovative data sources and analyses in other European countries and abroad. As pointed out below, no attempt is made to cover the developed countries exhaustively. The review is based on papers published in demography, epidemiology, and public health and on information drawn from the websites of the organisations collecting the data. The paper is primarily focused on routinely collected information covering a whole country or a major part of a country, in contrast to surveys for specific populations such as physician surveys. No attempt is made to draw up an inventory of sources by country; this would indeed be a useful future research project. The paper deals instead with the pros and cons of each source for mortality and morbidity studies in demography. Data sources for evaluating healthcare performance and costs-such as in the EuroHOPE project-lie outside the scope of this paper, though these are of course crucial issues.",

(2017) point out, it is continuity, completeness and relevance at local administrative levels that distinguish civil registration and vital statistics information from other population data sources. Statistics on causes of death, used to measure the relative contributions of various diseases on mortality, are based on the death certificate delivered by a medical doctor. For an overview of the data production process and the main types of possible analyses see, e.g. Rey (2016) . In the cases where the patient dies at the hospital or the doctor certifying the death is the patient's general practitioner (GP), the information on the cause of death is supposed to be reliable. However, and especially for the GPs, the question is raised about their training in terms of knowing how to fill in the medical certificate and their interest in doing so (McAllum et al. 2005) . As an example of a special training programme addressed to students of medicine in their last year, family doctors and interns, with the objective of improving professional competence regarding the certification of causes of death according to the international regulations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), see Alonso-Sard\u00f3n et al.

This certificate was proposed in 1977 (at the time of the International Classification of Diseases ICD-9) in order to ensure a better comparability of the statistics on this subject between countries. Causes of death should now be coded following the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (presently ICD-10), see Mesl\u00e9 (2006) for a comprehensive overview. The certificate is set out in two parts. The first part is designed to retrace the process which has led to death. The starting point is the immediate, or direct, cause of death (line 1). Then successive lines invite going back through the sequences that led to death, the last line of part 1 providing the underlying cause of death, and the lines between the first and the last delivering the intermediate cause(s). Part 2 of the death certificate is devoted to condition(s) which could have contributed to death but are not part of the main causal sequence leading to death. Finally, on the right-hand side of the certificate, a column allows stating the approximate time interval between the onset of each condition and death, in order to verify the coherence of the description of the process.",

Using the WHO classification in force (currently, ICD-10-an ICD-11 is in its final phase and is planned for implementation in 2018), the reported conditions are translated into medical codes. WHO (1992b) has formulated selection and modification rules in order to improve the reliability of mortality statistics and to allow selecting a single cause of death, the underlying cause, from a reported sequence of conditions. All morbid conditions, diseases and injuries entered on the death certificate represent the multiple causes of death (see 'Using data on multiple causes of death' section below).",

The user enters ICD-10 codes corresponding to the conditions reported on the death certificates. Iris then selects the underlying cause (IRIS Institute Website, http://www.dimdi.de). One can point out the pioneering role of the USA in implementing automatic coding, with the National Center for Health Statistics' development in the late 1960s of the ACME computer system for standardising the production of mortality statistics.",

Though the data on underlying causes of death are not comparable over long periods of time due to changes in the WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and to improvements in diagnostic practices, they do shed some light on time trends for the large ICD chapters of causes of death. There are presently 20 chapters of causes in ICD-10. The underlying cause of death can be used to analyse mortality differences between populations or over time. For example, racial differences in life expectancy in the USA can be 'explained' by the differences in the leading causes of death between the white and the black populations (Kochanek et al. 2013) .

            "text": "Several attempts have been made to bridge different ICDs by the reclassification of causes according to one of the ICD revisions. Probably, the best known of these attempts are those by France Mesl\u00e9 and Jacques Vallin, with various collaborators, at the INED in Paris (see, e.g. Mesl\u00e9 and Vallin 1996) . The registration of causes of death is not without problems, however, and these can hamper comparisons over time and across countries, as when using the WHO Mortality Database on mortality by age, sex and cause of death. First, one can point out the successive revisions of the ICD and the problem of bridging between two ICDs. For example, if one compares ICD-10 to ICD-9, ICD-10 not only increases the classification details (and shifts from a numerical to an alphanumerical classification system) but also includes 'changes in the coding rules by which a single cause of death is selected from among the multiple causes reported by physicians as causing or contributing to the death' (http://cancerprofiles.ca). Secondly, changes in the reports of causes of death may also be due to the use of new diagnostic techniques allowing a more efficient detection of diseases, to changes in the concept of diseases, and the appearance of new diseases such as HIV. Thirdly, training of MDs for the certification of causes of death can vary greatly among countries. In addition to the diagnostic accuracy issue, MDs only report diseases or conditions that they judge relevant for causing the death. According to WHO, the rate of illdefined causes per 100,000 people, at ages 0 to 64, varied from 0.44 (Malta) to 22.51 (Portugal) for the EU population (European Health Information Gateway, 2012 data). In addition, age misreporting can sometimes be a problem for some population groups, such as immigrants. Finally, even among developed countries, the coverage of the cause-of-death statistics can vary across countries and over time. For example, according to recent estimates, the coverage was estimated for Cyprus at 78% in 1997 and at 86% in 2011, while it was 100% at both dates in Sweden (World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository/ World Health Statistics). And one should also point out the difficulty, as with all classifications, in reaching univocal solutions in the ICD.",

One can, for example, study hypertension-related deaths by taking into account any mention of hypertension on the death certificate, using multiple cause-of-death data. Though useful for determining associations among causes of death, causal sequences and patterns of diseases (see for instance Redelings et al. 2007) , contributory causes of death are however rarely considered in the tabulation of mortality statistics, though death is often the result of a combination of causes, especially at older ages. In their book Recent Trends in Mortality Analysis, Manton and Stallard (1984) were among the first to thoroughly examine the use of multiple-cause mortality data in the context of medical demography. In particular, they examined pattern-of-failure representations of mortality, i.e. combinations or joint occurrences of causes of death found on the death certificates, and showed the advantages of this approach compared to the sole use of the underlying cause of death.",

The authors also took up, to give an example among others, the issue of analysing multiple causes of death (MCOD), with an application to cancerrelated mortality in France and Italy. After studying the quality of the data on multiple causes of death, the authors present various indicators for analysing MCOD data. Using French and Italian data, they examine the most frequent associations of causes of death with cancer, the latter being reported either as the underlying cause of death or as a contributing cause. Five patterns of associations are distinguished in the present case. The authors conclude by stressing the interesting fact that the multiple-causes-of-death approach 'can help to identify associations which, though not currently validated by medical knowledge, should be taken seriously and investigated further' (p. 488). D\u00e9sesquelles et al. (2014) also used the multiple-cause-of-death approach to compare mortality from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dementias in France and Italy, pointing out inter alia possible dissimilarities of reporting practices. Though the multiple-cause-of-death approach can be recommended, the number of contributory causes reported on the death certificate varies from country to country, hampering to some extent international comparisons. Differences among countries with respect to certification and coding systems can be a problem.",

For example, an international study from 2000 onwards has shown that out of 83 countries having cause-of-death registration, only 20 countries had high-quality death registration data that could be used for estimating injury mortality, because elsewhere, injury deaths were frequently classified using imprecise, partially specified categories (Bhalla et al. 2010) . Furthermore, it is well known that some types of external causes are difficult to evaluate. For example, suicides are often underreported, especially in countries where suicides are not morally or socially accepted (T\u00f8llefsen et al. 2012) . It is also difficult in many cases to determine the intent of the death: intentional self-harm, or homicide or accident\u2026? Such is the case, for example, of single-vehicle accidents and drownings. To take another example, a death from a vehicle accident might occur not on the scene but some hours or days after the accident. What lapse of time after the accident should one choose after which the death will no longer be determined as resulting from that accident? This criterion varies between countries, from 'died on the scene' to 'unlimited' , biasing international comparisons. WHO uses a 30-day time limit in its publications, adjusting, when possible, the data provided by national sources. Consider another case: that of pedestrian fatalities. There are several definitions of who is a pedestrian, and how pedestrians are defined has an effect on the number of deaths that are counted as pedestrian deaths (see Noland et al. 2017) .",

A forensic autopsy was performed in 88.3% of Finnish R00-R99-coded deaths, whereas only 3.5% of Danish R00-R99-coded deaths were investigated with the forensic or medical autopsy. Their study shows that if all deaths in all age groups with unclear cause of death were systematically investigated with a forensic autopsy, only 2-3 per 1000 deaths per year would be coded as having an ill-defined and unknown cause of death in national mortality statistics. At the same time, the risk of unnatural deaths being overlooked significantly decreases. To achieve this, in Europe, it would require that the existing legislation on cause-of-death investigation be changed to ensure that all deaths of unknown cause be investigated with a forensic autopsy.",

In Belgium, the requirement for an autopsy was notified on 1.5% of death certificates in 2010. In France, in 2011, the percentage was similar. However, notification is absent in 26% of cases in Belgium and 10% in France. When performed, autopsies may lead to changing the cause of death, and the registration system should be adapted to take this new information into account. To give an example of the procedure, in France (and also in Belgium), the autopsy is usually requested by the MD filling in the death certificate.

Children, pregnant women, older individuals and people with pre-existing diseases are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Furthermore, infections can lead to sepsis and septic shock, which can be lethal in the older population especially. New forms of infectious diseases have appeared in the world, such as AIDS, SARS and Ebola. The incidence of some infectious diseases that were deemed conquered-such as tuberculosis-has increased significantly, and some diseases-such as influenza-are still highly lethal in some years, especially for the young and the old. Infectious agents, such as Helicobacter pylori and human papillomavirus, can also be a cause of various cancers. In addition, some pathogenic bacteria have become resistant to the drugs that are used to kill them. 2 A list of notifiable diseases has been established by WHO, and countries have adopted for healthcare providers (treating physicians, diagnostic laboratories, hospitals, street-based mobile units) a compulsory declaration of various infectious diseases (single cases or outbreaks) that may constitute public health emergencies. 3 As an example of current developments in this field, Denmark has recently set up a nationwide Danish Microbiology Database in order to enable real-time surveillance of communicable diseases and microorganisms (Voldstedlund, Haarh, M\u00f8lbak and MiBa Board of Representatives 2014) .",

Access to hospital discharges outside the area of reference is therefore required. In addition, the same event can be declared by multiple sources, e.g. a hospital as well as a GP. It is thus necessary to link all events to the same individual by a unique identifier such as a personal identification number. Of course, one also has to have access to the cause of death declared on the death certificates, irrespective of possible privacy issues. Then there is the problem of diagnosis; diagnoses on hospital discharges or on death certificates do not necessarily correspond to the strict MONICA criteria for definite myocardial infarction and must be checked if possible.

A register can also eventually give information on the prevalence of cancer and on the survival of cancer patients if deaths from cancer and the possible emigration of cancer patients are known. Cancer registers can be either general, registering all tumours, or specialised, such as paediatric registers or registers restricted to one organ or tract. They can be managed inter alia by cancer societies, governmental agencies or public health institutes.

Recourse to multiple sources of data implies that one has to handle possible multiple notifications of the same cancer case and that one must be able to link these notifications to the same individual, for example by way of a personal identification number (PIN). Multiple notifications can then be used to check the completeness of the registration. In several European countries, PINs are now attributed at birth to every citizen of the country.

Diagnostic means have also evolved over time. Furthermore, as discussed above, completeness of registration remains a problem if one cannot cross-check the cancer register with other sources using record linkage. Notification must be legally mandatory, and reminders should be sent to sources which do not fully comply. The diagnostic information should be based on a histological examination by a pathologist. In Denmark, the proportion of morphologically verified tumours reaches 89%.

In the EU, the pioneers in this field have been Austria (since 1993), Germany (since 1995) and Luxembourg (since 1999). Most ages are covered in these systems. In each case, an assessment of individual needs for long-term care is first conducted, either by a multidisciplinary evaluation unit or a physician, and provision of care is planned either in cash or in services on the basis of limitations in the activities of daily living. For the population covered by the programme, dependency insurance systems can provide (as in Luxembourg) the causes of dependency according to age, sex and residence, among others. They can also show the costs of care (including informal care) and the type of services dispensed.",

On a worldwide basis, an effort has been made since 2001 to collect internationally comparable disability data through the UN's Washington Group on Disability Statistics. The latter has made recommendations for a shortlist of questions to be included in censuses or surveys in order to measure disability consistently worldwide (Mitra 2013) .

For a discussion of developments in census-taking see Baffour et al. (2013) .

Contrary to a census, the results are sample estimates of the figures for the whole population and should be accompanied by sampling error estimations.

On the one hand, non-respondents (e.g. the institutionalised) are probably in poorer health than those who respond. On the other hand, homeless persons or immigrants for example (also possibly in poorer health) may not be included in the sampling base. In Denmark, only 59.5% of the questionnaires were fully or partially completed. The response rate was lowest in the capital and highest in North Denmark. It was lower among men (particularly young men), older women, unmarried people and non-Danes (Christensen et al. 2012 ). In the 2008 health survey in Belgium, out of an initial sample of 14,549 households, only 5809 households actually participated in the interview (Enqu\u00eate de sant\u00e9 par interview, Belgique 2008, ISSP, Brussels). The others could not be reached or refused to take part. Does low response bias the results of a survey? Some evidence shows it does not, at least when examining the relationship between variables in a multivariate model, though responserate bias is found for univariate distributions (Rindfuss et al. 2015) . The question remains open, however. Another issue in health interview surveys is the underreporting of events related to chronic conditions. It seems that recurring events give rise to a 'generic memory' for the group of events, leading to a difficulty in recalling individual incidents; in time, memories lose the details and similar events tend to become melded together (Means et al. 1989) . In addition, self-assessed health reports can be somewhat unreliable and inconsistent over time.",

According to the EHES website, core measurements, which all countries should at least include, are height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose and HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin). Once again, the problem here is a low response rate in the general population. In France, the response rate in adults was around 60% in the 2006-2007 survey, though a costly home-visit strategy was used, according to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Institut de veille sanitaire). Unfortunately, the activities of the EHES Coordinating Centre are presently limited, due to a lack of sustainable funding.

One can presently examine patterns of deaths by cause (including multiple causes of death); detect the spread of infectious diseases; monitor the incidence, prevalence and lethality of the main chronic diseases such as cancer; assess the level of disabilities and dependence-both physical and mental-of the population; measure the cost of morbidity and the consumption of medicine, etc. Recourse to these multiple sources is highly recommended, recognising that each source has its advantages but also its limits. Though the sources are to some extent complementary, the data they provide nevertheless represent a patchwork of information from which a coherent picture of mortality, morbidity and health is difficult to draw. For example, a Spanish study (Marta-Moreno et al. 2016 ) has compared the registration of dementia in three different sources: the pharmacy billing database, primary-care electronic health records and the hospital minimum basic dataset. The study concludes that, for this pathology at least, there is a weak concordance in the registration of dementia among the main health information systems and that all available health data sources should be taken into account in order to gain a global picture of the epidemiological and clinical reality of this health condition, which is particularly difficult to evaluate correctly. 15 Broadly speaking, many sources of data actually refer to the same individuals, though some sources (such as surveys or sentinel networks) are restricted to population samples or to subpopulations. The same individual may, for example, be interviewed in a health survey, and later on recorded in a CVD register, with information collected by the health insurance system and hospital statistics, and end up with his/her causes of death specified on a death certificate. Being able to link these various individual records together over time is therefore a priority issue, as record linkage can give the event history of this individual in the areas of health, morbidity and mortality. As longitudinal samples of individuals are difficult and costly to follow up, and as retrospective information cannot be obtained once the person has died, record linkage of individual files can provide at a rather modest cost the health trajectories of individuals in the population over their lifetime. One could, for example, examine for an individual the shift from good to ill health, then to chronic disease, disability and finally death, possibly taking into account various socio-economic characteristics of the individual (such as education and employment) and their change over time. Of course, record linkage does not yield a continuous picture of one's health situation but rather a series of shots of one's life. If the cuts between the shots are short, the main features of the life course can nevertheless be observed.",

If these are unavailable, the linkage can sometimes be conducted on the basis of common individual characteristics (see for example Masuy-Stroobant et al. 1977; Deboosere and Gadeyne 1999) , using probabilistic matching. Linking on individual characteristics may however lead to a significant number of non-linked cases. If the census is involved, this procedure should refer to a time period close to the census. The procedure is difficult to apply for linking multiple registers together. 16 Record linkage is of course much easier to perform if the same PIN is used in the various data sources (see, e.g. Jasilionis et al. 2007; Elo et al. 2014) . With a PIN, one can link, for example, death by cause, from the vital registration system, to the socioeconomic characteristics of the deceased, obtained from the censuses. In addition to individual-level matching, address-level matching has also been used, such as the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) system in Wales. To give another example, one can point out the additional use of both address code and business register code in Denmark for combining information on persons, dwellings and employment from different administrative sources.",

Large samples can also yield better coverage of the population of reference and can detect subsets of data requiring more specific modelling. Methods of handling data with varying degrees of precision are improving, as are those for efficient query evaluation and probabilistic database research. For example, Marucci-Wellman et al. (2015) used Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms for semi-automated coding of short injury narratives from large administrative databases. Auto-measurement of health indicators by the individual him/herself can be taken following a standardised protocol and included in an electronic database, with feedback to the individual validated by scientific studies. For example, new technology such as the smartphone 19 can be used to monitor various health characteristics and to automatically transmit this information to a central database, where medical feedback can be provided. Social media data, such as social networking sites, have been used, for example, for research on perceived risk factors of type 1 diabetes.

The most promising perspective, however, is to explore the data from these various sources together; integrating individual data gathered at multiple levels in view of improving diagnostics, prognostics and therapies and of producing new indications for personalised treatments. The field of translational bioinformatics is currently being developed to accomplish this (see among others Andreu-Perez et al. 2015) .

In the EU, Directive 2016/680, which will enter into force in May 2018, aims at protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. In particular, the Directive states that personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the subject (Article 24). Privacy issues are especially relevant when the database is privately owned, as in the case of some large genetic bio/databanks (e.g. 23andMe). Moreover, analyses are complicated by the fact that data are not stored in a centralised location and by the sheer amount of data to be stored and processed, at great financial cost. For example, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is over a petabyte in size and consists of more than 575,000 files. Downloading the data using a 10-Gbit-per-second connection would take over 3 weeks (Grossman et al. 2016 ).

Exploratory analysis, such as data mining; information visualisation and machine-learning of big databases solely yields possibly spurious associations among variables and not causal links. While an exploratory-data approach is never a substitute for sound causal modelling, it can nevertheless usefully inform it, especially when background knowledge on the topic of interest is scant. A good (i.e. bad!) example of erroneous causal inference is the wellknown Google Flu Trends study, matching search terms and flu propensity; the structurally unrelated matches were much too numerous (Lazer et al. 2014) .
