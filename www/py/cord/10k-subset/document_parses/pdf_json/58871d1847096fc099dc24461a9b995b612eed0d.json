We have analyzed the possible fold of facilitators and water channels of the MIP family based on structural predictions, on findings about the topology of CHIP28, and o.n the biophysical characteristics of water channels. We developed predictions for the following proteins: MIP26, NOD26, GLP, BIB, y-TIP, FA-CHIP, CHIP28k, WCH-CD1, and CHIP28. We utilized Kyte Doolittle hydrophobicity, Eisenberg's amphiphilicity, Chou-Fasman-Prevelige propensities, and our own Union algorithm. We found that hydrophobic amphiphilic segments likely to be transmembrane were consistently shorter than required for c~-helical segments, but of the correct length for [3-strands. Turn propensity was high at frequent intervals, consistent with transmembrane [3-strands. We propose that these proteins fold as porinlike 16-stranded antiparallel [3-barrels. In water channels, from the size of molecules excluded, an extramembrane loop(s) would enter the pore and restrict it to a bottleneck with a width 4 A ~< w ~< 5 A. A similar but more mobile loop(s) would act as gate and binding site for the facilitators of the MIP family.",

            "text": "Protein water channels through membranes are currently the subject of much interest. Based on their location and Correspondence to: J. Fischbarg distribution Hasegawa et al., 1993; Nielsen et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1993a) they may be important for cell volume regulation, for epithelial transport of fluid in general, and for a host of other water movements that take place across cell layers in the lung, blood capillaries, ocular trabecular meshwork, and the like. In past decades, protein water channels were postulated to exist based on indirect but rather compelling evidence (Hays & Leaf, 1962; Solomon, 1968; Macey & Farmer, 1970; Parisi & Bourguet, 1983; Macey, 1984; Verkman, 1992) . The strongest evidence for their existence came from the fact that such water channels appeared remarkably specific, permeable only to water and no other small hydrophilic solutes except for formamide (Whittembury et al., 1991) . The recent sequencing, cloning, and functional expression of the channel-like integral membrane protein of 28 kDa (CHIP28) water channel (Preston & Agre, 1991; Preston et al., 1992) enhanced the interest in this area, and prompted other laboratories to follow suit. The more recent clonings of several other water channels (Fushimi et al., 1993; Manrel et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1993a; Abrami et al., 1994) have moved the discussion to another level.",

We predicted secondary structure using several algorithms: hydropathy, H; Kyte-Doolittle scale, (Kyte & Doolittle, 1982) ; amphiphilicity, g; (Eisenberg, Weiss & Terwitliger, 1984) ; secondary structure propensities (Prevelige & Fasman, 1989) ; CFP algorithm, for Chou-Fasman-Prevelige; the predictions from a robot that uses evolutionary information in conjunction with a database fed to a neural network (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) PHD (Profile network prediction Heidelberg) unmanned server program PHD (Rost & Sander, 1992) ; and our own Union algorithm (Fischbarg et al., 1993; Fischbarg et al., 1994) that consists in adding hydrophobicity and amphiphilicity propensities, and subtracting CFP 4-point positiondependent turn propensities (pt) for given stretches of proteins. As in the papers above, we scaled H, g and pt values to -4.5-+4.5, performed algebraic addition, and rescaled the resulting Union propensities to -4.5-+4.5.

The scores (data not shown) all fell in a \"gray zone\" (identity: 19 to 25%; similarity: 44 to 56%). It is well known that bacterial porins are evolutionarily quite distant among themselves, so in spite of the porins having the same secondary structure their sequences show little overall similarity (Welte et al., 1991) , and therefore their alignment scores rarely exceed those above. The two porins examined here provided a good example. Hence, a relationship between any two of these proteins can neither be affirmed nor refuted from such values; in particular, whether CHIP28 may fold as either a porin or a multihelical protein cannot be settled by the scores noted.",

The similarity between some of these sequences has been pointed out before (Chepelinsky, 1994) . However, the last two lines in the alignment of Fig. l a add predictive information arising from the CHIP28 sequence. The last line shows the CHIP28 hydrophobicity profile (for a window of seven residues, and scaled ascendingly from 0 to 9). It is apparent that the regions with higher hydrophobicity, thus presumed to form either c~-helical or [3-strand structures, correspond to stretches of residues which are reasonably well conserved in the rest of the family. Conversely, the gaps tend to coincide with regions of lower hydrophobicity, and thus presumably forming connecting loops. In line (i), the rectangles label those segments of CHIP28 for which we predict ~3-structure (see below).",

This indicates to us that the prediction of a particular type of structure is perhaps less reliable than the prediction that there is secondary c~ or ~ structure in a given segment. Assuming hence that there is either type of such structures in the segments delimited by PHD, some of the segments appear too short to span the membrane as c~-helices (for which 20 residues are presumed necessary), but have the correct length to span the membrane as [3-strands (usually 9-10 residues, but as few as 6 residues may suffice (Radding, 1991) ).",

We give here an additional evaluation of our procedures in the bar diagram of Fig. 2 , which shows the correlation coefficients between predictive procedures and either existing structures, or the predicted structure of CHIP28. For this purpose, we constructed an arbitrary step function (' 'structure\") valued at 4.5 at existing (or predicted) (x or [3 segments indistinctly, and at -4.5 elsewhere. We verified that smoothing the predicted CFP and Union profiles improved the correlation scores; we chose empirically to smooth the profiles with a fast Fourier Transform filter (span: seven points). As Fig. 2 shows, the Union algorithm correlates better with the correct type of structure in both [3-barrel and (x-helical proteins (albeit by a narrow margin in the last case, and with understandably large errors given the minimal sample available). CFP overpredicts [3 structures in the {;{-helical proteins, although here too the deviations may interfere with the actual picture. On the other hand, CFP correlates better with the structure in the ~3-barrels; the small error for CFP~ adds credence to it. For CHIP28, Union very narrowly favors [3 over (x structures; however, CFP clearly selects global [3 folding over (x. The difference in favor of the correlation of CFPp over CFP,~ appears too large to be attributed to overprediction.",

However, the pattern does not seem consistent: depending on which protein is examined, some of those segments break into smaller ones. Even when the U,~ propensity is relatively high and maintained throughout the protein, as in MIP26, the CFP,~ and PHD marks delimit a fair number of short segments. Even more, in the same MIP26, the Uc~ profile shows 16 peaks corresponding to comparatively short segments; 16 is the number of [3-strands expected from a porin fold. In Fig. 3b , the CFPp marks and the PHD predictions delimit consistent segments which are generally once more too short to span the membrane as o~-helices. The Up profiles exhibit a periodicity consistent with a multistranded [3 fold. Such patterns are more readily apparent in the N-terminal half of GLP, BIB and 3~-TIP, and in the C-terminal half of the water channels. The close correlation of the CFPp and Up profiles in the C-terminal half of CHIP28, WCH-CD 1 and CHIP28k appears also noteworthy. Turn propensity information is implicit in the U profiles and is not shown in Figs. 3a and 3b so as not to overload the graphs; still, there are frequent turn propensity markers, all the more so in relatively short proteins such as these. Such high turn propensities are potential structure breakers, so their presence militates against the existence of relatively long, undisturbed segments of helical ((x or [3) structures. For membrane proteins, this is consistent with the presence of numerous segments of the correct length to be transmembrane [3-strands.",

We have previously employed prediction methods similar to those utilized here. In the first instance (Fischbarg et al., 1993) , the U~7 peaks identified the approximate location and length of the [3-strands in two porins. More recently, we have generated similar predictions for other membrane proteins (Fischbarg et al., 1994) , including a short description of a putative multi-[3-fold for CHIP28. As mentioned above, a prediction for the transmembrane and loop regions of CHIP28 has been advanced (Preston & Agre, 1991) by the researchers that cloned it. In that model, the transmembrane segments are all 20 or more residues long, which is consistent with Ix-helical structure. The topology of such prediction has been recently tested by vectorial proteolysis led to nonfunctional proteins, since these would have disturbed the channel fold. Agre and colleagues themselves mentioned in their discussion ) that mutations in loops B and E are less tolerated than elsewhere in the CHIP molecule, and that such loops are candidate structures of the pore-forming domains of CHIP and other aquaporins. That would, of course, increase the number of transmembrane segments above the six originally proposed (Preston & Agre, 1991) . Loop C deserves some consideration, since we predict it inside while the original proposal (Preston & Agre, 1991) has it outside. The evidence from protease digestion of CHIP28 plus an E1 insert at T120 locates such loop outside . However, this discrepancy may be only apparent; for instance, E1 may have somehow modified the protein fold so as to emerge on the outside. To be noted, aside from this aspect, the picture appears cogent so far.",

For instance, in R. capsulatus porin, the pore has an irregular ellipsoidal cross section with axes of some 13 x 10 A. If the entire width of such a pore would be available for diffusion, large solutes would traverse this channel. In the porin above, a loop enters the pore, remaining in contact with the barrel wall, and restricts the pore opening to a quasitriangular cross section of some 9 A in height and 7 A at the base. We are able to propose a barrel model for CHIP28 because it has loops that may restrict the size of the pore, otherwise the model could not be correct. There is evidence that water and formamide traverse a water channel (Whittembury et al., 1991) but not urea (Whittembury et al., 1991; Van Hoek & Verkman, 1992) or compounds larger than it. If so, a steric restriction must exist, and must also be more pronounced than that for porin. From the molecular models illustrated in Fig.  6 , the minimum size a pore ought to have for the permeation of these molecules is: for water, 2.1/~; for formamide, 3.9 ]k; and for urea, 5.0 A. Hence, the loops inside the putative barrel ought to restrict the size of a bottleneck inside the channel to not less than 4 and not more than 5 A.",

One explanation for this is that the molecule includes one or more electrostatic filters against electrolytes. Such filters could result from the close juxtaposition of charged residues of opposite signs; indeed, some of the predicted loops contain such arrangements, as in segments 126-131 and 158-163. for water by some of them, and for the facilitator properties uncovered so far for other ones. We propose that a restricted pore such as that found in porins would fit the description. Figures 7, 8 and 9 exemplify this concept by displaying selected views of POR1. Figure 7 shows a cross section of POR1; for clarity, only the backbone appears. As can be seen and as discussed above, one of the loops resides inside its pore and restricts its diameter. The shape of the loop hints at the possible presence of a pocket in its concave site, which might serve to bind substrates in the facilitators. Figure 8 shows a longitudinal section of a 15-A thick center slab of POR1 (the ~3-strands in front and in back are not shown for clarity). As can be seen, the restriction created by the loop extends only to a central band rather than to the entire length of the pore. In addition, the loop that appears at the top right might represent an additional binding site or restriction. In Fig. 9 , the center of the loop has been removed, and the CPK spheres of the atoms lining the resulting pore are shown so as to give a view of the bottleneck in the pore profile. Parenthetically, the model proposed here differs from one recently advanced by Agre and colleagues in that in their case the channel would be circumscribed by two loops, while in the present one the channel is formed by the entire ~3-barrel translocation unit plus a single loop. As anticipated above, we propose that a fixed barrel framework and a disposition of the loops similar to that of Fig. 9 . As in Fig. 8 , except that the center of the loop is not shown and the channel-lining atoms are shown with their space-filling CPK spheres. porins could account for the selectivity and gating characteristics of M I P family proteins.",
