We used the standard formula for calculating the sample size needed to estimate a proportion in a large population of patients: n = (z 2 a/2 * p * (1 \u2212 p))/d 2 ). In our case, using the z distribution with an alpha of 0.05, the sample size needed was calculated to be 93 patients.

In addition, physician confidence in their ED diagnosis significantly improved after ultrasound. Several critical medical conditions were recognized with a high accuracy relative to discharge diagnosis including ADHF (100%), pneumonia (85.7%), extrapulmonary TB (85.7%) and pleural effusion (100%). Clinicians in resource-limited settings need to make timely, urgent management decisions for dyspneic patients, often with limited radiology capacity. This study demonstrates that incorporation of point-of-care ultrasound into the evaluation of dyspneic patients changed the leading ED diagnosis in most cases. Initiating urgent treatment to cover a broad differential diagnosis may be of limited benefit and can negatively impact patients and health care resource utilization in general. Narrowing the differential and changing the leading diagnosis with ultrasound may facilitate more appropriately tailored patient care.",
