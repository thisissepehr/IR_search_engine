The transcriptome was generated to expand the genetic resources available for this species to help investigate the genetic basis behind larval developmental stage transitions and tissue functioning, as well as traits with potential to be exploited commercially for the aquaculture of this and other shrimp species. The aim was therefore to generate a highly complete P. monodon transcriptome at the risk of it containing higher levels of transcript redundancy. This was confirmed by BUSCO results which demonstrated the transcriptome to be highly complete (C:98.2%) with low fragmentation (F:0.8%) or missing (M: 1.0%) genes but high levels of duplication (D:51.3%). These assembly statistics are comparable to those obtained by a transcriptome assembly from L. vannamei 15 (C:98.0%, F:0.7%, M:1.3%, D:25.5%), but greatly exceeded those of another P. monodon assembly focussing on gonadial tissue recently made available publicly 10 (C:33.7%, F:44.9%, M:21.4%, D:6.8%). As other recent NGS analyses of P. monodon have focussed on only one or two tissue types without including any larval stages or biological replicates, generated fewer total reads, or experienced data loss due to quality trimming of low quality reads or low mapping efficiencies [8] [9] [10] [11] , these are likely to have missed many transcripts. In contrast, the sequencing and assembly strategy used here covered more tissue types at greater read depth and employed multiple de novo assembly tools to reduce assembler bias. Using the nrA database, 30.0% of transcript clusters found in the nine tissue types and 38.1% of transcript clusters found in the eight larval/post-larval stages analysed were successfully annotated. These annotation levels were comparable to those reported to date in similar studies on different crustaceans 8, 15, 24, 31 . While transcript cluster annotation levels were lower using the SWISS-PROT database compared to the nrA database, the percentage of successful GO-term assignments was substantially higher. In addition to the annotations, analyses were undertaken to identify transcript clusters expressed differentially across tissue types or early life-history stages, irrespective of successful annotation. The identification was done to help provide initial evidence for transcript roles in specific tissue functions or developmental transitions.

When compared across species, a reciprocal MegaBLAST showed that the transcriptomes of P. monodon (present) and L. vannamei 15 shared approximately 48% of contigs. Since the assembly metrics of the L. vannamei transcriptome were similar to those of our P. monodon transcriptome, the low number of shared contigs could stem from considerable differences in transcript type or sequence composition between the two shrimp species.

An important consideration for this type of analysis is the normalized read count cutoff value for each cluster to be considered \"unique\", which was arbitrarily set at above 10 in a specific tissue and <10 in all others. At >100 normalized read counts, only approximately half of the assigned unique clusters were retained, indicating that the expression levels of many of these potentially tissue-specific clusters was relatively low. Among the annotated transcript clusters most highly expressed in female gonad tissue were FAMeT, PEPCK, GPx and nasrat. Functional roles these proteins may play range from the shrimp moult cycle and reproduction 32 , the primary step of gluconeogenesis 33 , preventing oxidative stress 33 , to specifying terminal regions of the embryo 34 . Among the annotated genes expressed most highly in eyestalk tissue was hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH), a key neuropeptide hormone that regulates blood sugar, moulting and reproduction 35 . A subset of transcript clusters highly expressed in lymphoid organ tissue was also highly expressed in gill tissue, most likely due to high concentrations of haemocytes within both tissue types. The majority of genes expressed most highly in hepatopancreas were annotated, potentially reflecting the shared metabolic functions of this organ with those of other animals. Also of much interest were the non-annotated transcripts expressed uniquely in specific tissue types. For example, transcript clusters expressed highly in male gonad were poorly annotated by both databases and included a large proportion of clusters, annotated or not, expressed exclusively in adult tissue types, indicating that male reproductive organs utilize many genes that remain poorly characterized. The grouping of genes with similar expression patterns broadly categorized these transcript clusters into potential functional groups within each tissue type, thereby guiding the selection for more targeted molecular function analyses. Based solely on gene expression patterns, the transcriptome data identified unique groups of transcripts involved in transitions between P. monodon early life-history stages. There was a major disparity between the annotation success of transcript groups upregulated in early or late stage embryogenesis, highlighting how poorly early developmental pathways have been characterized in crustaceans. Also of significance was the presence of orthologs of the Spaetzle gene, known in Drosophila flies to establish the dorso-ventral patterning of the early embryo 36 among transcript clusters detected consistently across later larval and post-larval stages. Since each larval and post-larval stage sequenced comprised a pool of several hundred individuals, quantitative and/or spatial transcript expression patterns would be required to draw further functional conclusions.
