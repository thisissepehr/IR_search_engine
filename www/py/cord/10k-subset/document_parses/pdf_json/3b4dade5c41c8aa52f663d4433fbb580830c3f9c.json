Here it is assumed that spreading takes place on a dynamic small-world network comprising short-and long-range infection events. Approximate equations for the epidemic threshold as well as the spreading dynamics are derived and they agree well with numerical discrete time-step simulations. Also the dependence of the epidemic saturation time on the initial conditions is analysed and a comparison with real-world data is made.",

            "text": "Modeling the process of disease spreading has traditionally relied on differential equations, describing the dynamics of infection spreading within uniformly mixed populations [1, 2, 3] . The basic premise of uniform mixing is that contacts between all individuals in the population are equally likely, and thus any infected person is equally likely to infect any other person. The spreading process itself is modeled using rate equations, describing population flows between epidemiological classes of individuals, such as susceptible (S), exposed (E), infective (I), and recovered (R). The simplest of these types of models is the widely-utilized Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [see e.g. 2, 4] , in which susceptible individuals (S) may become infected (I) and continue to infect others until finally removed (R) from the population due to recovery, death, or containment. In this approach, however, the uniform mixing hypothesis has long been considered unrealistic, and spatial effecs and heterogeneity have been shown to profoundly affect disease transmission, persistence and evolution [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . Instead of relying on this kind of mean-field models and due to recent advances in the research of complex networks [11, 12, 13] , there has been increased interest in trying to capture the effects of contact patterns between individuals. These patterns can be described by contact networks, where the vertices correspond to individuals and the edges to contacts between them [14] . One of the main motivations for studying complex networks has been to better understand the structure of social networks [15, 16] , which without doubt has to be reflected in contact networks. Thus there is a natural link between epidemic modeling and research of complex networks.",

A key result of these studies is that spreading processes are very fast on realistic network topologies, especially on small-world and scale-free networks, due to the effect of very short average vertex-to-vertex distances and, in the case of scale-free networks, due to the presence of highly connected hubs. Here, we discuss a \"minimal\" model of the spreading dynamics of disease transmitted by random contacts, such as common influenza [23] . The basic idea is to capture some salient features of spreading dynamics by utilizing the SIR mechanism on a dynamically changing small-world contact network 1 . Related works on static and dynamic small-world models [15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] have shown the existence of a shortcut-density-dependent epidemic threshold as well as scaling properties. In contrast to these studies, our focus is explicitly on the spreading dynamics, i.e., on the development of an epidemic, as formulated in terms of rate equations.",

Like social networks various contact networks display the smallworld property, which means that long-range contacts between individuals result in short average distances along the edges of the network. In epidemiology these long-range contacts can be considered either infrequent contacts or random encounters taking place in an underlying regular short-range network structure, which in turn can be interpreted as groups of people having regular or frequent contacts -such as those between friends or colleagues. In order to capture these features, we define the contact network as comprising a regular one-dimensional lattice of N vertices with fixed coordination number 2z, and with additional temporary long-range links, changing their configuration at random. It is noted that periodic boundary conditions are assumed, as depicted in Fig. 1 . This network acts as the substrate for disease spreading, composed of two different processes: the short-range (SR) process corresponding to passing the disease on to the nearest circle of persons, i.e. along the underlying regular lattice, and the longrange (LR) process to infecting any randomly encountered person. The main dynamics of spreading is modeled using the SIR mechanism, such that individuals in the network are at any given time labeled as being either susceptible (S), This process can be readily iterated numerically until changes no longer take place. The process step (1) corresponds to transmission of infection along the regular underlying lattice (the short-range process) and step (2) amounts to the randomly changing long-range connections (the long-range process).",

Due to the fact that the spreading process is stochastic, we will describe its characteristics with average quantities, which should be interpreted as averages over several epidemics. By I(t) we denote the average number of infected individuals at time t and N (t) the average number of individuals being ever infected. We also define an auxiliary quantity F(t), which denotes the average number of pairs of vertices where one vertex is infected and its nearest neighbor susceptible, i.e., the number of fixed edges along which a short-range transmission can happen. Here we call F(t) as the amount of domain walls, such that the short-range spreading process can be viewed as growth of domains of infected people with the walls of these domains moving with average velocity p s .

This quantity describes the epidemic threshold such that an epidemic will take off only if R 0 \u2265 1. It should be noted that the spreading dynamics is often seen to depend mainly on R 0 . However, it is well known that this quantity is not useful outside the uniform mixing assumption, and corrections have been suggested to take it into account in more complex spreading models [see e.g. 2]. In our case, the spreading dynamics cannot be solely determined by the number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual. The reason is that the effect of a secondary infection caused by nearest-neighbor transmission is different from the one caused by a long-range jump. Especially in the initial stages of the disease, long-range jumps will (almost) always generate new spreading domains expanding with the rate 2p s (or \u223c 2p s z for larger neighborhoods), whereas nearest-neighbor transmissions only expand existing domains.",

In the model the assumption that the network represents the whole susceptible population, is not quite realistic.

In this case, the quatity N represents the total epidemic size rather than the entire suscep- tible population size.

Fig. 5 shows the epidemics data during these influenza seasons together with our fitted theoretical curves for i(t) calculated using Eqs. (7) and (8) . For these fits, we set p r = 0.17 / day, which corresponds to an infective period of about 6 days, and the SR spreading probability p s was set to 1, while p j was used as the fitting parameter. We first fitted p j for each individual epidemic and then averaged the results, obtaining p j = 0.0075 / day as the so called consensus value. Finally, the theoretical epidemic curves were scaled to account for the differing number of susceptibles N for each annual epidemic. The quality of fits using constant spreading parameters indicate that the underlying dynamics can be thought to remain more or less the same for each annual epidemic. Note that fits of similar quality could in principle be obtained by using the equations for the classical fully mixed SIR model [see e.g. 3]; our example merely shows that Eqs.
