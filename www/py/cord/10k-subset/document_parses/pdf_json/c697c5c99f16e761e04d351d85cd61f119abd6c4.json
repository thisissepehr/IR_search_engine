In the combined group analysis there was no association of the polymorphism with asthma or atopy under either dominant or recessive models of inheritance (Table 2) .

To dissect these interactions further, we stratified our atopy data into several groups based on age and gender (Table 3 ) and applied bonferroni correction to avoid false positives arising due to multiple testing. Since our study group had a majority of women (Table 1) , we chose 50 years as a divider of age in the combined cohort for our stratified analysis as it is also the age of attainment of menopause 16 (overall median age at natural menopause in Poland is 51.25 years 17 ,).

Even though, the Polish cohort tested for rs368234815 and the other cohorts for rs12979860 the data could be compared since a strong LD (r 2 = 0.98) between them in the European population has been recorded 6 ; furthermore, the MAFs in the cohorts were similar (Table 5) . Moreover, recent data shows that the SNP rs12979860 is the 'best tag-SNP' for the functional polymorphism rs368234815 due to a common underlying linkage structure at the IFNL locus 23 . The results show that we failed to replicate our findings from the older women's sub-group of the Polish cohort, in other cohorts (Fig. 1) . Further, except for a nominal association (p = 0.04) with an additive genetic model in the COPSAC younger men's cohort no other sub-group in any of the remaining cohorts showed any significant association with atopy ( Fig. 1) . The older women's and younger men's sub-groups had significant heterogeneity in the effect of the polymorphisms (p = 0.008 and p = 0.028 respectively) between the different cohorts and no significant association was seen after meta-analysis. Even in the other sub-groups where there was no significant heterogeneity between the studies, no significant effect of the polymorphism on atopy was noted in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1) . Similar results were seen using the fixed-effect model (Suppl.

No significant heterogeneity in the effect between different cohorts in the sub-groups was noted. None of the sub-groups from any of the cohorts including the Polish cohort, showed any significant association with asthma. Interestingly, the older men's sub-group showed a significant effect of the polymorphism(s) on presence/absence of asthma after meta-analysis. The minor allele (which gives rise to/linked to the allele that can express a functional IFN-\u03bb4) had a protective effect on asthma in the older men.

Further, the results from the Polish study are not due to a 'cohort effect' since the association of the polymorphism with atopy is within the older women's 'cohort' and not between an older and a younger 'cohort' . The association of the polymorphism in older women was not just with atopy but also translated to association with some important determinants of severity of asthma like BDR and CS usage. Even though we did not carry out multiple testing correction for our association tests with the polymorphism and clinical features of asthma (Table 8) we feel the phenotypes are not independent of the atopic sensitization phenotype that we identified during our initial analysis (Tables 3 and 4) , and therefore less likely to be false positives. For example, atopy-related eosinophilic inflammation and increased CS usage frequency among patients may be correlated 24 ; this is apart from the fact that atopy was a confounder with the association involving bronchial reversibility tests (Table 8) .

It should be noted that the replication study had several limitations. Firstly, the findings we made in the Polish cohort were from a hospital-based case-control design while all the three replication cohorts (except COPSAC cohort) were population-based (Table 5) . Secondly, 72% of the Polish cohort (among the 384 subjects with information on atopy) were asthma cases and specifically the older women's sub-group in this cohort had substantially more (75%) asthmatics than controls while the replication cohorts had 16% asthmatics among older men and women in GERA cohort (10% in AR-negative controls and 34% in AR-positives; AR-negative controls were 77% and AR -positive were 33% in the cohort); 9.6% and 11.6% of older women had asthma in the Inter99 and Heath2006 cohorts respectively. It is possible that the association with atopy in the Polish cohort had an underlying link with asthma that could not be accounted for in the replication study. In support of this, significance of association decreased when data was adjusted for asthma status in the older women's sub-group in the Polish study (Table 4) . Thirdly, the Polish cohort was enriched with severe asthmatics (22% controlled, 30% partly controlled and 48% uncontrolled according to GINA 2016; up to 65% of patients were in medium or high dose iCS; 60% were on long acting \u03b2-agonists; Table 1 ) while this information was not available for the replication cohorts. Fourthly, similar methods were not used to test for the phenotypes in all the cohorts (Ex. SPT in the Polish cohort and serum specific IgE in the Danish cohorts to test atopy).

These discrepancies in endpoint phenotypes and the intrinsic differences in the composition of the Polish and the replication cohorts may have led to non-replication of the findings. Our findings from the Polish cohort need to be further validated in well-designed replication studies and functional studies. It is likely that the functional IFN-\u03bb4-generating dinucleotide variant rs368234815 may associate with a specific endotype of severe asthma in older patients. It is possible that a sustained course of inflammation of the airways that happens in older asthmatics, likely in response to viral infections over a period of time, will lead to an environment conducive for the penetrance of the genetic effect of IFNL variants in asthma. Since the Polish cohort had >60% women asthma patients and was enriched with older women (Table 1) we saw strong association in the older women's sub-group ( Fig. 1 and Table 3 ). We hypothesize that presence of IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G allele may be beneficial for an elderly female asthma patient by protecting the airways from increased inflammation associated with virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Although, no direct association of the allele with history of asthma exacerbations or hospitalizations was revealed (data not shown), it should be noted that the Polish asthma cohort represented a group of difficult-to-control asthmatics (only 22% had well-controlled disease according to GINA criteria; Table 1 ). Along these lines, association of the allele with the presence of acute airway reversibility in response to inhaled beta2-agonists may indirectly reflect less severity of the disease and/or lower airway remodeling in those patients that carry an IFN-\u03bb4-generating \u0394G allele. It remains to be established if the effect of the functional IFN-\u03bb4-generating variant on asthma control and severity is also valid in older men. We did see a protective effect of the minor allele rs12979860 (which tags the IFN-\u03bb4-generating allele) against asthma in older men/all men after meta-analysis of data (Figs 2 and 3) .

Future studies aimed at understanding the functional role of IFN-\u03bb4 in regulating inflammation of the airways are required to understand the mechanism behind the association that we identified in the Polish study. Alternately, this finding could be a false positive result, which also has to be confirmed by doing a well-designed replication study first in another Polish cohort and later in other populations. Nevertheless, our comprehensive analysis with sufficiently large sample sizes has established that an important candidate gene locus consisting of the immunomodulatory type III IFNs does not associate with atopy and AR in the general population ( Fig. 3A and Table 6 ). The association could be more subtle and with specific endotypes related to inflammation of the airways in asthma. The protection to asthma seen in men/older men (Figs 2 and 3) is nominal and further studies can aim at validation of this result in more specific endotypes based on severity of asthma. A fully functional IFN-\u03bb4 may be associated with protecting the airways from inflammation in certain endotype(s) of the disease, specifically in older asthmatics. While further studies are needed to understand this association, whether these endotypes are a result of virus-induced stimuli, also remains to be examined.

The RC2 project enabled genome-wide SNP genotyping (GWAS) to be conducted on a cohort of over 100,000 adults who are members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region (KPNC), and participating in its RPGEH. The resulting GERA cohort is composed of 42% of males, 58% of females, and ranges in age from 18 to over 100 years old with an average age of 63 years at the time of the RPGEH survey (2007). A subset of 62,281 subjects from European ancestry was quality controlled (QCed) and analyzed. A 3-step QC protocol was applied using PLINK and included 2 stages of SNP removal and an intermediate stage of sample exclusion. The exclusion criteria for genetic markers consisted on: proportion of missingness \u22650.05, HWE p-value \u2264 1 \u00d7 10-20 for all the cohort, and MAF <0.001. This protocol for genetic markers was performed twice, before and after sample exclusion. For the individuals, we considered the following exclusion criteria: gender discordance, subject relatedness (pairs with PI-HAT \u2265 0.125 from which we removed the individual with the highest proportion of missingness), variant call rates \u22650.02 and population structure showing more than 4 standard deviations within the distribution of the study population according to the first seven principal components. After the QC analysis, 56,637 subjects remained for genotype imputation and association testing. We performed a two-stage imputation procedure, which consisted in pre-phasing the genotypes into whole chromosome haplotypes followed by imputation itself. The pre-phasing was performed using the SHAPEIT2 28 tool, IMPUTE2 29 for genotype imputation and the SNPTEST (https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/ snptest/snptest.html#introduction) for association testing. In this work we used 1000 G Phase 3 haplotypes (October, 2014) as a reference panel to infer ungenotyped variants.
