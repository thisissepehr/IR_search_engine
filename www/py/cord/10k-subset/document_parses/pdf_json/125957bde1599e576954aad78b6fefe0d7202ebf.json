PTLD developed 1 year after transplantation (tx) in 14 patients. Five patients were diagnosed at autopsy, 2 were lost to follow up, 3 died before therapy could be instituted, and 1 patient has just started chemotherapy. Of the 8 evaluable patients, 2 received acyclovir and are alive in complete remission (CR) and 6 received chemotherapy surgery. Of these 6, 4 died of lymphoma and/or infection, 1 died of unrelated causes in CR, and 1 is alive in CR. PTLD is a severe complication of tx, usually running an aggressive course which may preclude prompt diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, therapy is feasible and must be tailored on the histologic subtype.

On the contrary, for ML and MM with widespread disease, prompt administration of chemotherapy is mandatory, since response to antivirals alone is unlikely in these forms which display a rapidly progressive and aggressive clinical course as indicated by the high number of autopsy diagnoses, 31 % in our series. Chemotherapy should be started even though its toxicity is prominent, requiring intensive supportive measures, and adequate timing is not always possible due to intercurrent infectious or toxic episodes. Choice of a chemotherapy regimen should also take into account special problems which specifically apply to this category of patients.
