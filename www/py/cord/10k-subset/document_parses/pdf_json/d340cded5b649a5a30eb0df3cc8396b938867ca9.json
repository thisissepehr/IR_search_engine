Limited exposure to violence is seen as a component of healthy living. However, there is limited understanding of violence from a public health perspective within rural communities. Rural refers to those communities with a population less than 10,000 outside the main commuting zone of a large urban area. Population health approaches, including the social determinants of health, are well supported by public health officials. Generating information about rural youth violence from a Canadian perspective would add to our understanding of these social determinants while providing guidance for policy and program development. Current understandings of youth violence are limited to an urban, and oftentimes, American perspective. An ongoing two-phase Canadian study on rural youth violence included qualitative interviews with 52 youth and the completion of a questionnaire that had been developed from the qualitative responses. The questionnaire has been completed by a larger sample of rural youth. The findings generated from this ongoing study will be useful in linking violence with social factors that impact health and thereby guide population health programs and policies. In this way, the role of public health to develop policies and implement programs will be directly influenced by evidence while addressing an ongoing public health concern.",

The fear of violent acts is of itself a major cause of anxiety, 1 requiring intervention by community mental health professionals. In addition, the injuries sustained from violent encounters have costly public health treatment consequences. 2 Of importance, within the determinants of health framework, limited exposure to violence is an essential component of healthy living. 3 However, there continues to be little understanding of the effects of youth violence from a public health perspective, particularly within rural communities. In this instance, rural refers to those communities with a population under 10,000 outside the main commuting zone of a larger urban area. 4 This definition includes communities that are rural, remote and/or northern. The authors of this paper note the deficit of information about youth violence within rural settings in a Canadian context, including no available statistics on violence that differentiate youth by geographic location, 5 and refer readers to their ongoing Canadian study on this topic. 6 The key message is that rural youth violence is a public health issue that needs to be addressed through population health approaches.",

The strength of a social factors approach is that health is recognized as linked to a number of inter-related variables. 7 Definitions of violence include physical forms (i.e., sexual violence, involvement of weapons including body parts and knives 9 ) or non-physical forms (i.e., bullying 9 ). Some authors view violence as a violation of basic human rights in settings such as homes and schools. 10 Youth violence is now being increasingly viewed as a major health problem that impacts many levels of local communities from policing to health care. 11, 12 Furthermore, if violence is acknowledged through a population health approach, then resources such as multidisciplinary implemented teen centres would be readily available to prevent and deal with this issue. For instance, the more successful programs include multiple agencies who are involved with youth. 13 Violence is a concept that fits within the social factors framework and increasingly is discussed in government documents 3 as a public health concern. The necessity of addressing crises in public health, including diseases such as SARS and West Nile Virus, reduces available opportunities and resources to deal with ongoing issues such as violence. However, there has been a documented need to review and strengthen the Canadian public health system, 14, 15 increasing the potential to systematically and appropriately address ongoing issues such as violence.",
