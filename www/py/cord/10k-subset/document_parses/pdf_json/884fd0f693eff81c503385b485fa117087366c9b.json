Many of these are merely speculative in nature without considering the potential upheaval that these advanced technologies will have upon every aspect of our societies, including the way we treat urolithiasis. For instance, our last major historical upheaval was the Industrial Revolution which resulted in the fall of bladder stones but the rise in renal stone disease. During this time frame, we have gone from a \"craftsman-oriented\" economy to a \"mass-produced\" type of economy. We have gone from a \"community-centric\" environment to a \"globally centric\" one [ 2 ] . We have seen the rise and fall of innumerable hegemonies of government to a more pluralistic kind of control [ 3 ] .

For life in general, medicine more relevantly, and to urolithiasis specifi cally, there is a \" growing mountain of research \" threatening to engulf us.

In fact, the literature is strewn with the fl otsam and prophesies gone awry. For instance, Bill Gate's 1981 classic, \" 640,000 bytes of memory ought to be enough for anybody .\" Ken Olson in 1997 stated, \" There's no reason for individuals to a computer in their home .\" Better for our purposes is Yogi Berra's quip, \" It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future \" [ 5 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 502, "end": 507, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 930, "end": 935, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principles of Change"}, {"text": "No one can accurately predict the future. New developments and new discoveries are always capable of rewriting what we think we know. Chance certainly plays a role and no one could have foreseen the impact of the World Wide Web on our society when Tim Burners-Lee wrote the code for CERN in 1991 (note: that's not that long ago!). So why spend so much time on something as fi ckle as the future? You can think about what has happened to us by a lack of foresight as we've already alluded to, or you can consider the scenario of nuclear weapons as an example. Would you rather develop a monster before you consider how to make a cage? Long-term forecasting is not futile when carefully considered concerns remain the focus. To quote Drexler, \" In a race toward the limits set by natural law, the fi nish line is predictable even if the path and pace of the runners are not \" [ 6 ] . David Hume, the eighteenthcentury Scottish philosopher, introduced in 1737 the notion that observations cannot logically prove a general rule; rationalism cannot be trusted [ 7 ] . By 1945, Bertrand Russell presented the twentieth century's response to the \" growth of unreason \" and the death of empiricism to vault us into our modern era [ 8 ] . This thinking has led us to our recent predilection of future speculation and the scientists' favorite science philosopher Karl Popper phenomenon of evolutionary process of development [ 4 ] . Technologic variations and advancements are quite often deliberate, plodding, and crude in comparison to the science that lies behind them. Edison tried virtually every product on the planet before settling upon tungsten as the fi lament for his incandescent light bulb [ 9 ] . Charles Goodyear tried everything to make unacceptable rubber into the moldable, durable substance we today use in tires by a chance drop of sulfurized rubber in his lab. The point is that engineering the marvels of tomorrow's technology is methodical and predictable in a fashion in that it is evolving. Future breakthroughs result in rapid progress. Progress evolves through cycles of design, calculation, criticism, redesign, and construction. So, forced by competition and testing, science evolves towards more power and accuracy. Efforts to predict the engineering achievements started way back in classic Greek technology. Leonardo da Vinci in his collected works called the Codex Atlanticus made projections using detailed drawings regarding the ability of machines to improve upon motion and power control with machines [ 10 ] . He designed an earth-mover to make canals that were never built. He designed a robotic man at the age of 30. He utilized a design he envisioned at the age of 26 to power his automated soldier or knight. This device used a front wheel drive, rack-and-pinion automated cart to provide both the power and the mobility that his robot would require. Leonardo designed a chain-drive system that would remain unbuilt for almost three centuries and the bicycle. He failed to build an aircraft because of his inadequate understanding of modern aerodynamics and lift. But this lack of scientifi c knowledge certainly did not stop him from designing these machines [ 10 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 874, "end": 879, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1060, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1227, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1420, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1698, "text": "[ 9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2535, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3192, "end": 3198, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Principles of Change"}, {"text": "Prior to concluding this section of the introduction, there are three key publications that are worth reviewing. The fi rst is Vannevar Bush's 1945 article that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly , entitled \" As We May Think \" [ 11 ] . Bush was an MIT-trained engineer with a particular aptitude for math. He was a young professor at Tufts when World War I broke out. Bush developed a device that would use magnetic fi elds to detect submarines. He traveled to Washington in May of 1917 to meet with the new director of a group of scientists advising the government, the National Research Council (NRC). After the war, Bush matriculated back to MIT's electrical engineering department. He became interested in analog computers to solve complex equations and by 1931 he completed the fi rst differential analyzer. He also proposed and built a machine for the FBI that could review 1,000 fi ngerprints per minute which he called a rapid selector. In 1937, Bush became the president of the Carnegie Institution with a then $1.5 million annual budget for research. His prestige rapidly increased and by 1940 Roosevelt called on him to create a new national organization for scientifi c military research called the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). Bush was made the fi rst chairman and given a direct line to the White House. By 1941 the Offi ce of Scientifi c Research and Development (OSRD) was set up and Bush became its director [ 12 ] . Bush became intimately involved in advising Roosevelt about the Manhattan Project. Colliers magazine hailed Bush as the \"man who may win or lose the war\". By war's end, Bush dreamed about a national science group and the National Science Foundation was created in 1950 [ 12 ] . He published \" As We May Think \" in the Atlantic Monthly. This article describes a whole host of technologies that did not then exist. He describes a theoretical machine called a \" memex .\" This was to be a multipurpose intelligence extender. The memex would be a repository of general information that a user could call upon for facts and fi gures [ 11 ] . His description is hauntingly close to modern hypertext and the Internet.

It was subsequently published in the February issue of Caltech's Engineering Science by the Nobel laureate Richard P. Feynman. The title, typical of Feynman, was inauspiciously called \" There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom \" [ 13 ] . He stated that he wished to talk about \" the problem of manipulating and controlling things on a small scale \" [ 13 ] . He goes on to state that an enormous number of technical applications would arise from such a technology and that there were no fundamental reasons of physics preventing its development. He proceeded in the ensuing 11 pages to recount the possibilities of molecular engineering, which heretofore have been unheard of. He then continued with the physics of such machines including miniaturization, lubrication, supply, and demand. He concluded with a discussion of \" rearranging the atoms \" themselves. He speculates the complexities involved with quantum physics at the atomic level, but concludes \" The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It is not an attempt to violate any laws; it is something, in principle that can be done; but in practice, it has not been done because we are too big \" [ 13 ] . He stated that it is his opinion that such a nanotechnology ( sic word mine) cannot be avoided in the future. And he created a cash award of $1,000 for school kids and engineers to start this technology: \" I do not expect that such prizes will have to wait very long for claimants \" [ 13 ] . But Feynman never saw the emergence of this technology in his lifetime. Tom Newman, a Stanford electrical engineering grad student, used electron-beam lithography to transcribe the fi rst page of Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities onto a square 1/160th of a millimeter on the head of a pin [ 14 ] .

Moore. The article was called \" Cramming more components onto integrated circuits \" by the then director of Research and Development of Fairchild Semiconductor [ 15 ] . He started this article with the prophetic words: \" The future of integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself \" [ 15 ] . Moore talked about the future of intelligent technologies as no one before had; he speculated about ubiquitous computerization. He stated that computers of the future will be distributed, not centralized. He predicted that the machines of the future would be built at lower costs and with faster turnaround because of acceleration of power and capacity. He based his observations on 25 years of experience in the miniaturization of electronic components. He predicted that integrated electronics would become generally available throughout all of society, performing many functions that presently are done inadequately by high-cost systems. He predicted that silicon would most likely remain the basic material of semiconductors and the key to this expansion. He fi nally warmed to his topic in talking about graphs and curves he had generated. For simple circuits, he said, the cost per component was nearly inversely proportional to the number of components. He demonstrated cost curves from 1962, 1965, and 1970 showing a 1/10 reduction in cost but he didn't stop there. He predicted that if trends hold, and he saw no reasons why they should not, then within 10 years an integrated circuit with 65,000 components could be achieved for minimum cost and the size will be reduced to about \u00bc a square inch. He also predicted the heat generated by tens of thousands of components in a single silicon chip. He also noted that the shrinking dimensions on the integrated structure would result in operations at higher speeds for the same power per unit area [ 15 ] . Thus, in one neat and tidy paper, Moore predicted the coming era of intelligence technologies. All subsequent works on the future of these technologies continued Moore's prescient observations and his doubling times have eroded, not held constant.

Lest you think that believable science is being stretched into science fi ction, a wide variety of resources will be utilized that are available to you, the reader (disbeliever or believer), so that you can check on the sources ' validity of anything that this author is writing about. Ray Kurzweil, the entrepreneurial scientist who developed digital software for the music industry, has published several books on this subject. He has a website and technologic discussion blog with graphs regarding human technologic advancement as the fundamental preposition and he devised the law of accelerating returns. K. Eric Drexler published \" Engines of Creation \" that has already been mentioned.

In June 2002 our own National Science Foundation (introduced by the way by Vannevar Bush, recall \" As We May Think \") met in Arlington, Virginia, and reported upon \" Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance \" [ 16 ] . They focused on specifi c issues that are rapidly advancing in four areas of scientifi c research. These included nanotechnology, biotechnology, informational technology, and cognitive science. In addition, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has now had yearly scientifi c workshops and meetings specifi cally addressing the convergence of technologies and the applications to space exploration. By reviewing each of the salient pieces of these science facts, it is hoped that you too will feel the growing excitement that has spawned so much negative or \"conservative\" scientifi c response by some serious researchers.

Carnegie Mellon bestowed their top science award to him in 1994, and he won the American Publisher's Award for Most Outstanding Computer Science Book in 1990 for his \" Age of Intelligent Machines \" [ 18 ] . It was in fact Kurzweil's thinking and fi ndings that launched Sun Microsystems founder Bill Joy to write the \"highly\" thought-provoking article in the journal for technophiles Wired called \" Why the Future Doesn't Need Us \" [ 19 ] . In this excellent observational science article, Joy argued that our technologies are becoming increasingly complex and that public participation in advancement has all but been eliminated. He outlined a scenario where our technology has become so sophisticated that it endangers the human species. This brings \"shades\" of Terminator to our consciousness and from a very gifted scientifi c insider. What has Joy so spooked is a well-fabricated and illustrated march to \"massive leaps\" in technologic advancement by the convergence of intelligent technologies [ 19 ] . Kurzweil in his writings took all of mankind's technologic advancements and attempted to do what Gordon Moore had done for just microprocessors, but he overlaid them in graphic formats to see what is happening. He then explained that almost every aspect of modern technology is rapidly expanding at exponential growth rates. The exception is computer or intelligent technology itself which is expanding at a double exponential rate. That is to say, that its rate of growth is itself exponential! Mankind's fi rst technologic steps, \"sharpedged tools, fi re, and the wheel,\" took tens of thousands of years to develop and master. By 1000 AD progress was much faster. By the nineteenth century, there were more inventions than all of recorded history previously. The fi rst 20 years of the twentieth century saw more advancement than the entire nineteenth century.

Wiener started meeting with other young scientists monthly at Vanderbilt Hall in the early 1940s. One of the fi rst investigators he met was a Harvard Medical School professor of physiology Arturo Rosenblueth. This pair would later team up during the war years to investigate a machine's ability to predict voluntary control (desperately needed for wartime anti-aircraft design systems). By 1943 these investigations were published in the Philosophy of Science called \" Behavior, purpose and teleology \" [ 32 ] . They specifi cally defi ned behavior as any change of an entity with respect to its surroundings. This began the scientifi c understanding of mechanized actions or the understanding of human behavior with mechanized processes. Their fi rst classifi cation separated active behavior, in which the object is itself the source of energy in the output, and nonactive behavior or passive behavior in which all the energy in the output comes from the immediate output. The essence of their theories was based upon feedback loops for control; the mathematics was just beginning at this time. They stated, \" the broad classes of behavior are the same in machines and in living organisms\u2026.while the behavioristic analysis of machines and living organisms is largely uniform, their functional study reveals deep differences \" [ 32 ] . Wiener and Rosenbleuth's ideas would begin to stimulate formal scientifi c investigation when the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation organized a series of scientifi c meetings to fertilize new methods of investigation throughout the 1940s.

About 15 years ago, when DNA sequencing was in its infancy, it was estimated that it would take thousands of years to sequence every base pair on the whole of human chromosomes. But the entire sequence was completed in just under 15 years at a cost of several millions of dollars. In fact, you can now purchase your very own DNA sequencer and perform this amazing feet of biotechnology yourself at home.

Cloning is the next \"headliner.\" Though manipulation of the human genome in this fashion may have already occurred, it is likely that other converging technologies might reduce the necessity to even pursue this capability. There are companies that are already synthesizing nanofactories to make chromosomes. They have been photographed and show some capacity of functioning in biologic systems. It is possible that with the maturation of biotechnology, we might be able to dramatically alter major diseases such as atherosclerosis and malignancy which we've struggled against for centuries.

As the rise of stone surgery is almost entirely dependent upon the technology and skill of the surgeon, there has been increased emphasis on comparing the surgeon to the airline pilot. In aviation, the pilot is expected to perform with a risk of failure less than 0.0001 %. Complications in surgery occur in the range of 1-5 % or more, this is a factor of 100\u00d7 more than in the airline industry. Many operative modifi cations have been instituted to control preventable errors in the operating room, but truthfully not many of these actually apply to stone patients. For instance, wrong site errors are not even a realistic probability in patients with stones; though patients can present with bilateral stones, there are no real reported cases of this phenomenon. The errors in stone disease management can come from lack of skill; a surgeon, for instance, elects to perform one procedure when another is likely to benefi t the patient preferentially, or unex-pected anatomical variation makes an approach risky. The most common scenario is a large renal stone that might best be managed with a percutaneous nephrostomy and an antegrade nephroscopic approach that the surgeon may not be comfortable performing. All too often, a shock wave lithotripsy is chosen because sadly the reimbursement level is higher than some more applicable method. Our system of reimbursement in the United States has evolved into a nightmare of complexity and one that no longer refl ects upon reality [ 46 ] . These fi nancial disincentives have to be considered in a realistic discussion of error and more often than not are disregarded or relegated to the backroom discussion [ 47 ] . Atul Gwande mentions the notion of professionalism that would normally be considered the check to such unprofessional behavior. He states, \" All learned occupations have a defi nition of professionalism, a code of conduct. It is where they spell out their ideals and duties. The codes are sometimes stated, sometimes just understood. But they all have at least three common elements. First is an expectation of selfl essness\u2026second is an expectation of skill\u2026third is an expectation of trustworthiness \" [ 48 ] . These are truly great expectations for rules of professionalism in an era of spending cutbacks, limitations in hours, fi nancial cliffs, and rising malpractice costs. But a patient is on the other end of this professionalism equation and that can never be forgotten.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 319, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 482, "end": 488, "text": "[ 45 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1979, "text": "[ 46 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2156, "text": "[ 47 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2669, "text": "[ 48 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "To Err Is Human"}, {"text": "\" Through all of human history, health caregivers have been respected individuals in society.

It is hard to fi nd confi dence in a system that appears to be spiraling out of control. Two sentinel studies that were used by the Institute of Medicine to generate their pronouncements in To Err Is Human came from the 1991 Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study I & II [ 50 , 51 ] . The fi rst study was a retrospective review of 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected places in New York State in 1984. They found adverse events in 3.7 % of these hospitalizations and 27.6 % of these were secondary to negligence. They found that 70.5 % of these errors resulted in disability that persisted for less than 6 months, 2.6 % resulted in permanent disability, and 13.6 % led to the patient's death [ 50 ] . Their second piece immediately followed looking at the nature of these errors. Drug complications were the most common adverse event (19 %), wound infections in 14 %, and technical complications in 13 %. The major area that was isolated was diagnostic errors in 75 % and what were called \" noninvasive therapeutic mishaps \" or errors of omission (77 %) [ 51 ] . The other major study utilized by the Institute of Medicine was Costs of Medical Injuries in Utah and Colorado published in 1999 [ 52 ] . This also was a largely Harvard School of Public Health endeavor. In this evaluation they identifi ed 459 adverse events, of which 265 were preventable from 14,732 randomly selected discharges from 28 hospitals. The costs associated with adverse events equaled $348,081,000 and about \u00bd of that number from the preventable errors [ 52 ] . Clearly the technologies that we have presented could solve many, if not most, of these errors as time goes on and the cost savings in error prevention would pay for the technology. The professionalism of those involved was not evaluated, nor is there a method to evaluate this quality of the health caregivers. The Institute of Medicine followed their fi rst publication with recommendations for fi xing the trouble US healthcare system with a second, Crossing the Quality Chasm [ 53 ] . In this volume they begin with \" The American health delivery system is in need of fundamental change. Many patients, doctors, nurses, and health care leaders are concerned that the care delivered is not, essentially, the care we should receive .\" In nine chapters they proceed to relate how they think that a new and improved health system can be created.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 267, "text": "[ 49 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 548, "end": 559, "text": "[ 50 , 51 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 992, "end": 998, "text": "[ 50 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1360, "text": "[ 51 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1498, "text": "[ 52 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1836, "text": "[ 52 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2325, "text": "[ 53 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "To Err Is Human"}, {"text": "How does all of this apply to the history of urolithiasis and what are the implications to the treatment of stone disease? In a related paper in the Journal of Urology in 2001, a survey of urologic medical malpractice cases was reported. They were able to identify 259 medical malpractice claims from 1995 to 1999. The average urologist gets sued for malpractice twice in his career and certain parts of the country were worse than others (Southeastern > North Central >South Central > New England > Mid-Atlantic > Western > New York) [ 54 ] . They also noted that the most common procedure-specifi c claim was for endoscopic procedures (22 %) with most being stone patients. In another study involving malpractice litigation in one state, New York, 469 urologic claims occurred between 1985 and 2004 with a remarkably constant 22 claims annually during this period. Claims based on endourologic procedures (mostly stones) were the second leading cause of malpractice claims in NYS, second only to oncologic operations (25 vs. 46) [ 55 ] . In a follow-up on this same group of malpractice claims, missed diagnosis led to malpractice claims in 75 cases, and only two of these were stone related, both kidney stones [ 56 ] . Now getting to the stone group and a different group of investigators but still looking at New York State from 2005 to 2010, we can gather even better information. There were 25/585 closed claims that were related to endourology (4.3 %). Sixteen of these cases were women and nine were men. Twenty-two of these cases involved stones; the remaining three were from ureteral obstruction. Cystoscopy and stent placement accounted for most of the suits (52 %) followed by ureteroscopic lithotripsy (32 %), shock wave lithotripsy (8 %), and percutaneous procedures (8 %). Sixteen patients (62 %) required secondary procedures following their complications and six (24 %) died, all from sepsis. Ureteral stones were the major culprits in about 80 % of these cases [ 57 ] . Things go wrong far more commonly than medical malpractice cases get fi led in our tort system. With the emphasis on the historical perspective, in fact, things go wrong a lot less commonly now than at any previous time in surgical history.

In the past two decades an increase in calcium phosphate stones has been noted in the United States, with females being more common than males [ 58 ] . We have seen that brushite stone formation is often concurrent with apatite plugging of the papillary tubules leading to fi brosis and permanent renal injury. This is becoming an increasingly disconcerting trend in urolithiasis and should serve as a warning to those of us who see and treat many recurrent stone formers to be ever vigilant to this possible conversion to a worse scenario [ 59 ] . In addition, it appears that our interventions in stone formers by repeated shock wave lithotripsy in particular might indeed be damaging the kidney itself and also contributing to the transformation from calcium oxalate stones to calcium phosphate stones [ 60 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 734, "end": 740, "text": "[ 48 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1076, "text": "[ 58 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1473, "text": "[ 59 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1738, "text": "[ 60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Six Sigma"}, {"text": "One might also argue that the advance in shock wave lithotripsy itself has not actually advanced, that, in fact, the methods and results have gotten worse.

One thing is certain: if a shock wave lithotripsy fails to break up the stone, odds are given our current technologies that another method should be utilized in subsequent interventions. Multiple, serial shock wave lithotripsies should not be considered the method of choice for dealing with non-fragmentable stones [ 61 ] . In addition, in skilled hands the holmium:YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) midinfrared laser remains currently unsurpassed and the most effective lithotripter source in the surgical armamentarium in the urologist's arsenal. With ureteroscopes evolving into smaller and improved optical capacity, there are virtually no regions within the kidney or ureter that can avoid these diminutive scopes' abilities. But complications can and do occur, but with systems in place to carefully monitor performance and follow-up of patients, one could speculate that Six Sigma (or 1/million) might not be achievable soon, but the aviation standard of 1/10,000 just might. Anesthesia using Six Sigma tools has now dropped its serious complication rate down or \" mishaps \" to near 1/200,000 [ 62 ] . Let us focus our attention on this amazing and truly underappreciated bit of fact. Ellison Pierce was fi xated on the notion that unacceptable numbers of serious complications occurred in anesthesia and when he was elected to be vice president of the American Society of Anesthesiology in 1982 he had opportunity to do something about it.

In the earliest surgical days of perineal lithotomy, mortality was age dependent and greater than 50 % of the patients died and probably many more suffered irreversible harm. Cheselden with his scrupulous separation of \"observed\" cases from his private practice (unobserved cases) reported statistics only on the former. Even with the development of transurethral lithotrity, there was an impressive mortality. Patients and surgeons were inured with death, suffering, and morbidity. We fortunately have evolved beyond this pain and suffering with great expectation to advance even further. Most of us have lived through two revolutionary eras of urologic practice: the endoscopic treatment of prostatic disease and the abdication of open stone surgery. Wickham has chosen the latter to represent the traumas infl icted upon our patients and the result of technology on reducing them. Progressing from open stone surgery through percutaneous nephrostolithotripsy and including fi rst-and second-generation shock wave lithotripsy therapy, patients are subject to less and less interventional trauma [ 68 ] . The results are dramatically reduced hospital stays, faster return to normal activities, and patients who are very aware of their good fortune.

By 1901 a standardized method of case reporting had been developed at Johns Hopkins Medical School. This was an attempt by early health professionals, physicians, and nurses to investigate the outcomes of care (Osler with the blackboard). This became mandated in the United States by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 1983. Unexpended fi ndings at autopsy also were historically signifi cant in evaluating the cause of death. Lundberg noted 40 % discrepancy between antemortem and postmortem diagnoses in 1998 [ 70 ] . Autopsies have continuously declined throughout the twentieth century. In the 1940s autopsy rates were typically at 50 %, but currently they are performed in less than 9 % of hospital deaths. Stone disease no longer has the high mortality rates that were ascribed to the past, but they still rarely occur. It is the morbidity that is frequently associated with stone disease presently that is of concern and the rising rates of prevalence of this disease. The perfect storm situation that underscores the concern for this morbidity is the overuse of shock wave lithotripsy in some regions for kidney stones, possibly because the reimbursement for this modality is so much higher than equally or in some cases more effective therapies [ 46 ] . When reimbursement begins to have a factor in the decision for therapy, there are all kinds of ethical concerns that come into play, outcomes typically not being foremost in consideration. Our hope for the future of technology is that it will solve this dilemma as well as make safer, less invasive methods readily available to urolithiasis sufferers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 205, "text": "[ 69 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 216, "end": 226, "text": "Coe (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 892, "end": 898, "text": "[ 70 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1641, "text": "[ 46 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "\" The integration and synergy of the four technologies (nano-bio-info-cogno) originate from the nanoscale, where the building blocks of matter are established.

Called \" Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance ,\" this government-sponsored conference covered all aspects of rapidly expanding technologies [ 16 ] . We have spent a good bit of this chapter discussing the exponential growth of divergent technologies-nano, bio, info, and cogno. What happens when they start to blur and combine to achieve the same ends? This is indeed what is happening. The old constraints of specialization are being wiped out by the supercomputing systems currently being implemented. Computers are becoming so powerful and fast that autoengineering systems are not only capable; they are the only method that can create the computer chips that are being used by the computers. This technology is crossing over to other design systems, engineering, and research and development. In other words, as intelligent technologies rapidly become more intelligent, the pace of change is further accelerated. The technology that will be with us tomorrow is defi nitely not with us currently. As with buying a computer currently, you can wait until the next bigger, faster, more sophisticated system becomes available and you will end up waiting forever.
