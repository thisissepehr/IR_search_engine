Species composition for a set of communities exhibits a nested pattern if species present in progressively richer assemblages form a series of subsets. Nestedness can form as a result of the dynamic processes of extinction or colonization. It can also reflect a nested distribution of habitats among the sites or the differential abundance properties of species through passive sampling. This study investigated whether Sonoran Desert woody vegetation in remnant islands within metropolitan Phoenix is nested and explored which mechanisms are responsible for the pattern. It also examined whether vegetation is nested in similar habitat types across islands, and how species abundance relates to the nested pattern and hypothesized mechanisms. All data sets were significantly nested, indicating a nested pattern at the island and habitat levels. Community-level analyses did not indicate a primary mechanism leading to the nested pattern. Among species with abundances correlated with the nested rank-order of sites, abundance properties were significantly related to different variables. This suggests that individual taxa respond to divergent ecological mechanisms, leading to nestedness. Thus, nestedness in plant communities can result from a complex set of contributors and may not be attributable to a single factor.",

Understanding the patterns and processes responsible for community composition in fragmented landscapes is an important goal of resource conservation and ecological theory. Studying community composition, in which attention is paid to species identities, illuminates system features unapparent to analyses of richness alone. Richness data can reveal that species have been lost, but often one must examine composition data to know how or why a system loses species. Nestedness analysis can potentially indicate which mechanisms structure communities and whether certain species in a fragmented system are likely to colonize new areas or face extinction. This study considered whether vegetation on desert habitat islands embedded within the urban matrix of the Phoenix metropolitan area, locus of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP-LTER) site, exhibits a nested pattern, and what mechanisms may be responsible for that pattern.",

Perfect nestedness means that all species observed in depauperate sites will be found in all richer locations. While perfect nestedness is very rare in nature, the degree of nestedness can be measured and significance assessed using simulations based on null models. Nestedness requires three conditions: species possess a shared biogeographic history, habitats are somewhat comparable, and species are hierarchical in distribution and frequency (Patterson and Brown 1991) . Since nestedness refers to a condition of ordered composition, any factor that serves to create heterogeneity will reduce the propensity for nestedness (Mikkelson 1993 , Wright et al. 1998 ). As such, the first two conditions serve as homogeneity constraints on species and sites, respectively; the third condition acts as a filter and reflects the factors that lead species to have variable incidences (Wright et al. 1998) .",

Darlington (1957) was the first to recognize a nested pattern among oceanic archipelagos and attributed this to the differential colonization of islands by species. Since dispersal abilities differ among species, Manuscript received 18 July 2007; revised 4 January 2008; accepted 18 January 2008. Corresponding Editor: J. A. Jones. 3 E-mail: saguaro711@yahoo.com more isolated islands would only contain those taxa capable of long-distance dispersal over the ocean or an otherwise inhospitable matrix. Extinction of species could also produce nested communities if vulnerability to population collapse differs among species. The area of available habitat acts to constrain population size by dictating an approximate maximum number of individuals capable of being supported on an island (Preston 1962) . Small populations tend to be more vulnerable to stochastic extinction events (MacArthur and Wilson 1967 , Gilpin and Soule\u00b41986, Fischer and Sto\u00a8cklin 1997 , Menges and Dolan 1998 , Gray et al. 2003 , Matthies et al. 2004 . While colonization and extinction imply the dynamic processes of assembly and disassembly, nestedness can reflect other underlying ecological patterns. Sites differing in habitat heterogeneity can form nested subsets if less common habitats support taxa specific to those habitats (Worthen 1996) . Thus, sites containing common and rare habitat types may contain both habitat generalists and specialists, while more homogeneous sites would only contain generalist species. Finally, when species consistently differ in their relative commonness and rarity without regard to habitat (Preston 1962) , they can form nested assemblages, since common species simply have a higher probability of occupying any given site via passive sampling (Connor and McCoy 1979) . These potential mechanisms are probabilistic filters (Wright et al. 1998) : habitat nestedness acts to filter habitats, passive sampling is an abundance filter, and isolation and area filters reflect the tendencies for species to differ in their colonization or extinction behavior, respectively. Circumstances over space and time determine whether one or more filters will produce a consistent ordering of species across sites and a nested structure.",

The ecological context of an archipelago can be considered as a simple a priori indication of which dynamic process is potentially operating.

On the other hand, oceanic islands formed in isolation from other land masses should exhibit nestedness primarily as a result of colonization (Cook and Quinn 1995) . While some studies have demonstrated colonization as a driving mechanism (e.g., Kadmon 1995 , Butaye et al. 2001 , Loo et al. 2002 , extinction has more often been indicated (Wright et al. 1998) .",

Increases in elevation within this study area are accompanied by an increase in mean particle size in the rockier soils on mountains and hilltops, which retards evaporation and promotes deeper percolation of rain water (Shreve and Wiggins 1964) , resulting in greater water availability to plants. Thus, elevation is a surrogate for productivity. Higher productivity can result in a greater density of individuals, which can passively sample more species. Also, multiple woody species that thrive at higher altitudes are not observed on lower slopes and plains due to moisture limitation. Hence, sites with wider ranges in elevation potentially offer a broader productivity gradient and an increase in island species richness.",

Polygons were designated to encompass areas containing continuous expanses of the desert environment lacking urban features as barriers. A contour map with 10-m intervals, generated using ArcGIS (2002) and derived from the Maricopa County Digital Elevation Model (DEM; available online) 4 was used in conjunction with the aerial photos to aid in interpretation. Reliance on twodimensional GIS layers alone would distort the relationship between polygons by overemphasizing flatter areas at the expense of steeper slopes. To compensate for this distortion, the three-dimensional surface areas of each polygon were estimated by dividing the twodimensional area by the cosine of the mean slope for that polygon; the Maricopa DEM was converted into a map of slope values, at 30-m resolution, and the mean was calculated for each polygon.",

Habitat diversity for each island was calculated using the Shannon index (Magurran 1988) , which incorporated the proportion of total surface area covered by each geomorphic type-soil class. Isolation was calculated as: I \u00bc R [ln(Area)/(Distance 2 )], where distance extended from the edge of the focal island to the edge of other islands or to the nearest expanse of outlying desert. For this purpose, the area of the outlying desert was assumed to be 9000 ha, which is approximately equal to the area of the largest island, South Mountain Park. The isolation index was intended to express the potential for a given patch to exchange propagules with other source areas and facilitate establishment of new species; this potential decreases with longer distances between sites and increases with larger areas bearing more plants and richer communities of animal vectors.",

Nestedness analysis using the NTC and BINMATNEST is based on presence-absence data at the community level. We hypothesized that species responding to mechanisms structuring nestedness will have dwindling abundance down the gradient until they are ultimately lacking on depauperate islands, reflective of their extinction in less hospitable sites. Alternatively, species may be rare or absent in sites lacking certain environments, leading to nestedness reflective of the availability of growth conditions.

Larger islands have more individuals, which allows for larger populations and a lower extinction rate for the remnant vegetation. Alternatively, larger assemblages of individuals have a higher probability of containing progressively rarer species along with common ones, so that larger islands passively sample more species. The total number of individuals is a function of both surface area and the density of individuals. Since mean density does not significantly vary with island area (Table 2) , area is the primary determinant of the island's total number of individuals, the community size. Furthermore, because island area is highly correlated with both habitat heterogeneity and mean elevation, it could not be included in the regression analysis.

The analysis of species abundance at the island level (Table 3) suggests that elevation is an important influence on nestedness. Mean elevation is significantly correlated with each of the seven species also found to be significantly related to nestedness, indicating that sites containing higher elevations also have the highest densities of those species. Three species (Ephedra fasciculata, Eriogonum fasciculatum, and Fouquieria splendens) are virtually absent in lower-elevation environments. The other four species occur at lower elevations but are more abundant at higher altitudes. On the other hand, abundances for Opuntia acanthocarpa, Carnegia gigantea, and Fouquieria splendens are more highly correlated with area than mean elevation or habitat heterogeneity, which is suggestive of area effects attributable to either extinction or passive sampling. Analysis of the relationship between species abundance and nestedness within single habitat types shows that abundance for four focal species declines down the nestedness gradient from species-rich to depauperate sites ( Table 4 ). Given that these data are restricted to a single habitat type, this analysis demonstrates that nestedness at this scale is driven by mechanisms other than habitat heterogeneity, which is an island-level variable. Furthermore, since nested rank-order of sites for habitats and the area of washes and slopes facing north and east are significantly correlated, this suggests an area effect influencing nestedness at the habitat level. For Ephedra fasciculata and Fouquieria splendens, elevation is the likely mechanism operating, since these are higher-altitude species; this is true to a lesser extent for Carnegia gigantea, which may be observed at lower elevations but is more abundant on the upper slopes.",

Individual washes at lower elevations are necessarily larger than those upslope, since water volume drained per wash increases as smaller tributaries merge. In the Phoenix metropolitan area, washes are more likely than mountain range habitats to experience fragmentation effects, since most mountains are preserved intact to their bases where they transition to the plains. Washes, on the other hand, are usually disturbed or transformed into drainage structures outside preserves, eliminating habitat for desert vegetation. Therefore, connectivity between washes is disrupted with fragmentation. While the plains are also vulnerable to fragmentation effects, vegetation in the flatlands is thinner and more dominated by generalists that reach higher abundances on slopes. Lycium sp. falls just short of significance; though Lycium sp. prospers best in the wash habitat, it is more of a generalist than Bebbia juncea, and may be found in the other habitats.",

Even though species may respond to different mechanisms, cumulative effects can reinforce each other to contribute to an aggregate pattern. This appears to be the case in this study. Some species tend to occupy less common environments found only at upper elevations, so they will only be present in higher mountainous remnants. Other species may be vulnerable to local extinction by directional selection or generalized disturbance. Smaller islands lack buffer zones, so that their limited expanse is exposed to repeated penetration by people from the city. If species are consistent across sites in their extinction vulnerabilities, the nested pattern will emerge (Patterson 1987) . It is instructive to conceive of the mechanisms as filters (Wright et al. 1998) . Species respond individualistically to patterns and processes in nature, with the collective outcome of nestedness resulting from multiple contributors.",

A multitude of mechanisms appear to contribute to the nested pattern, though their relative roles are unknown. Additionally, for these longlived species, how much of their community structure was determined before or after fragmentation? The extent to which species distributions were directly affected by fragmentation or existed prior to the separation of the sites is uncertain. A potential approach would be to designate and sample control areas similar in dimensions to this system's archipelago in continuous desert terrain to enable comparison (e.g., Harrison 1997) . However, it would be difficult to match the distinctive altitudinal and biogeographic site characteristics to allow comparability between the patchy and control areas in this case. A detailed demographic survey, preferably over a lengthy time scale, would be useful for better characterizing the current state and projecting the future status of remnant populations.",
