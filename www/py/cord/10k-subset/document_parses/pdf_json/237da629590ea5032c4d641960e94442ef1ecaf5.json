Twenty-four hours after the return to supine position, tidal volume was increased from 3.0 (2.2-4.0) to 3.7 (2.8-5.0) ml/kg (p < 0.005). PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio increased by over 20 % in 14/14 sessions for late sessions (\u22657 days) and in 7/13 sessions for early sessions (<7 days) (p = 0.01). Quantitative CT scan revealed a high percentage of non-aerated or poorly-aerated lung parenchyma [52 % (41-62)] in all patients. No correlation was found between CT scan data and respiratory parameter changes. Hemodynamics did not vary and side effects were rare (one membrane thrombosis and one drop in ECMO blood flow).",

PP can be effective in patients with VV-ECMO given that the use of ultra-protective ventilation [i.e. 3-4 mL/kg Vt] may increase the proportion of poorly-aerated areas in dependent lung regions [6] . As a result, PP during VV-ECMO may recruit the dorsal regions of the lungs, facilitate lung drainage and therefore improve oxygenation. The value of PP during VV-ECMO has furthermore been previously described in a few studies, the largest being a study by Guervilly et al. in which 12 h of PP significantly improved the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in 15 ARDS patients on VV-ECMO after a median of 9 days [7] . Altogether, data from this and other previously published studies suggest that PP during VV-ECMO is safe when performed by a referent team and ultimately improves oxygenation. Of note, these studies failed to find any improvement in respiratory system compliance [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

As specified in the procedure, in order to formally objectify respiratory improvement, respiratory and VV-ECMO parameters were maintained constant throughout the entire prone positioning session. An increase in FiO 2 and/or VV-ECMO blood flow was only considered when SpO 2 was below 85 %. VV-ECMO and ventilator settings were adjusted according to lung recovery after the prone positioning session. Data analysis also included the recording, at the above three pre-specified times, of complete blood gas (PaO 2 , PaCO 2 , pH, HCO 3 \u2212 , SaO 2 ), respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, Vt, PEEP, FiO 2 , pPlat, respiratory system compliance) and VV-ECMO parameters (blood flow, sweep gas flow, oxygen delivery by VV-ECMO device: FDO 2 ). Respiratory system compliance (RS compliance) was computed by dividing tidal volume by pPlat (measured during an end-inspiratory pause (1 s) minus total PEEP. Total PEEP was measured by using an expiratory pause (5 s). Driving pressure was calculated as plateau pressure minus PEEP [14] . The pre-ECMO survival probability was also calculated according to the RESP score [15] .",

In randomized controlled trials comparing supine and prone positions, the results on respiratory compliance have been inconsistent. Indeed, Mancebo et al. noted higher compliance of the respiratory system in the prone [20, 21] . Previous studies using PP during VV-ECMO also failed to demonstrate any significant changes in static compliance. Guervilly et al. suggested that the improvement in oxygenation without concomitant increase in respiratory static compliance and without decrease in PaCO 2 at constant levels of minute ventilation and sweep gas flow do not suggest lung recruitment by PP with relatively small Vt and high levels of PEEP but rather an improvement in VA/Q mismatch. Unfortunately, no CT scan data were provided in their study. Herein, all of our patients had major posterior condensation (>50 % of lung volume) and thus it is likely that PP in this situation allows lung recruitment. Arguing in favor of this hypothesis is the fact that PP further allows the use of increased Vt. Importantly, in 23/27 sessions, nurses described a major increase in sputum drainage that may have contributed to recruitment. Another hypothesis to explain this discrepancy is that prolonged PP sessions were used in our study (24 h as opposed to 12 h), which may have contributed to the observed improvement in compliance. Finally, the discrepancy could be due to different patient populations, i.e. patients still under sedation in whom it was not possible to use partial mode of ventilatory support or to a different phase of the disease comparatively to previous reports.",

Nevertheless, severe ARDS treated with ECMO and needing prone positioning is a rare occurrence and thus it is unlikely that a multicenter randomized study will be performed. Accordingly, only 36 cases have been previously reported in the literature in which session durations differed considerably. Therefore, we firmly believe that this study adds valuable information, first in confirming previous but scarce data but also in extending these data with new findings, notably on compliance.",

All authors read and approved the final manuscript. Additional file 3: Figure S1 . CT scan analysis. In a first step in the analysis of CT images (A), lung contours were manually delineated from chest wall, mediastinum and pleural effusion. This resulted in the crude lung volume (B). (Actual, True) lung volume (C) was obtained by excluding large vessels (densities above 150 HU on enhanced scans) and bronchi lumen and hyperinflated lungs (densities below 900 HU). Lastly, a normallyaerated lung was defined as having a density below 100 HU (D).",
