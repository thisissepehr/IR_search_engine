To test the effect of differentiation and activation on their susceptibility, AMf and BMo were aged, cultivated in either adhesion or suspension and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). It was found that freshly isolated PMf and BMo were non-permissive to PRRSV. PMf remained refractory but a few BMo became susceptible after 1 day cultivation. AMf were permissive with a signi\u00aecant increase of their susceptibility after one day cultivation. In a binding assay, it was demonstrated that the attachment of biotinylated PRRSV to AMf is much more ef\u00aecient than to PMf and BMo. Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) 41D3 and 41D5 which block PRRSV infection of AMf and are directed against a candidate receptor for PRRSV only reacted with the cell membrane of AMf. PMA treatment of AMf blocked PRRSV replication in the cells in a dose-dependent manner. The blocking effect of PMA decreased after 9 h continuous pre-treatment and diminished after 24 h continuous pre-treatment. PMA treatment did not affect the binding of PRRSV and MAb 41D3 and 41D5 to AMf. Direct or indirect treatment of AMf and BMo with LPS or cultivation in suspension did not signi\u00aecantly affect their susceptibility. These results provide clear evidence that PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for only some sub-populations of porcine monocytes/macrophages and that some speci\u00aec states of differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages considerably affect their susceptibility.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) resembles lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), three other members of the arterivirus group with regard to morphology, genetic organisation and structural proteins [9, 19] .

Cells of the macrophage lineage have previously been identi\u00aeed as the predominately and consistently infected cell type in PRRSV infected pigs [11, 14, 26, 27] . Furthermore, several observations indicated that PRRSV only replicates in some sub-populations of monocytes/macrophages. It was found that AMf even during the period of the highest virus titres in the lungs after natural or experimental infection, only a low percentage of levaged AMf carries PRRSV antigens [11, 18] . Also, immature macrophages and macrophages progenitor stem cells are not or less susceptible to a PRRSV infection. This was particularly evident for bone marrow cells, where replication of PRRSV was not detected in experimentally PRRSV infected pigs [11] . Similar evidence comes from``in vitro'' experiments in which different sub-populations of alveolar macrophages fractionated by density gradient centrifugation were shown to have different susceptibilities to a PRRSV infection [6] . Such heterogeneity may be a re\u00afection of the sate of differentiation and/or activation of the macrophages [28] . A number of factors such as ageing, some cytokines and a few chemical products have been found to be able to differentiate and activate mononuclear phagocytes [28] . Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) are two frequently used stimulants. Both LPS and PMA have a strong, rapid and easily reproducible activating capacity. Their structure and sites of activation in the cells have been extensively studied [7, 5] . LPS is a structural component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It activates monocytes and macrophages and stimulates them to produce certain factors, including TNF-a, IL-1, and prostaglandin E 2 [5, 29] . Studying the effect of LPS treatment on the susceptibility of AMf to PRRSV may give new insights in the pathogenesis of dual infection with PRRSV and bacteria. PMA has effects on monocyte/macrophages, including dramatic changes in cell shape, spreading, endocytosis, and release of lytic mediators and regulators [5, 7, 20] . PMA also stimulate premonocytic cells of some continuous cell lines to differentiate into a more mature monocyte/macrophage phenotype [20] . Because of those remarkable properties, PMA has been used to investigate the relationship between cell activation/differentiation and viral replication with some viruses [13, 33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 201, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 202, "end": 205, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 206, "end": 209, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 210, "end": 213, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 524, "end": 528, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 529, "end": 532, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 785, "end": 789, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1134, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1300, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1579, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1582, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1799, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1803, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2122, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2125, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2129, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2270, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2443, "end": 2447, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2451, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, it was examined if porcine monocyte/macrophage lineage cells isolated from peritoneal cavity, lungs and peripheral blood are susceptible to PRRSV and if their susceptibility was related to the degree of virus attachment.

Genetic, antigenic and pathogenic variations among PRRSV isolates in the USA and Europe have been reported [17, 32] .

The susceptibility clearly increases after one day cultivation. A similar increase of permissiveness to PRRSV infection was observed in a very small number of cultivated BMo. These results suggest that the state of monocyte/macrophage differentiation plays an important role in determining their susceptibilty to PRRSV. Similar enhancing effects of differentiation on virus replication have been observed with other viruses such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parain\u00afuenza virus-3, African swine fever virus, cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunode\u00aeciency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Visna-maedi virus and pseudorabies virus in monocytes/macrophages [13, 21] . Since BMo are precursors of tissue macrophages and readily mature into macrophages when cultivated in vitro [28] , it is logical to predict that some BMo may mature into susceptible macrophages similar to alveolar macrophages by cultivation in vitro.

When AMf were continuously pre-treated for 1 to 9 h, the virus replication was almost completely blocked. The cells regained full susceptibility after 24 h of continuous treatment. This rather peculiar \u00aending can be explained by the fact that, while the activating capacity of monocytes and macrophages by PMA reaches a maximum after 1 h exposure, a prolonged exposure to PMA for more than 6 h causes macrophages and monocytes to become refractory to PMA stimulation [7] . When monocyte/macrophage lineage cells are treated with PMA, both enhanced or decreased viral replication has been observed with other viruses.

In contrast to the PMA treatment, LPS treatment of porcine AMf and BMo did not in\u00afuence the susceptibility to PRRSV infection.

Although the activation of protein kinase C is also an essential process for LPS induced activation of the macrophage, the signal pathways used by PMA and LPS in macrophages are quite different [29] . Therefore, it seems that PMA modulated inhibition of PRRSV infection might be mediated by a speci\u00aec PMA-signalling pathway in porcine AMf. Recent observations suggest that PRRSV enters AMf through a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis (unpubl. data). PMA treatment does not change the binding activity of PRRSV and monoclonal antibody against the putative PRRSV receptor(s) to AMf. Therefore, the blocking effect of PMA does not act through down-regulating the expression of the virus receptor(s) on the cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 551, "end": 555, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Mononuclear phagocyte differentiation is a process of normal cellular development and homeostasis and re\u00afects a permanently altered expression of a cell's genetic potential, while macrophage activation is the process that causes reversible changes in macrophage phenotype and functions [28] .

Inef\u00aecient binding of biotinylated PRRSV to PMf, BMo and PBMC suggests that these cells lack the more speci\u00aec binding sites that are expressed on the membrane of AMf. Different binding activity of MAb 41D3 and 41D5, which block PRRSV infection of AMf and recognise a candidate receptor on the cell, to different monocytes/macrophages provide further evidence that the
