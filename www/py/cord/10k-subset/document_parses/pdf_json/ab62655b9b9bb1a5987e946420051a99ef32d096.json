Biological safety levels (BSL) are a series of designations used to inform laboratory personnel about the level of biohazardous risks in a laboratory setting. There are a total of four levels ranked in order of increasing risk as stipulated by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories, 5th edn. HHS publication no. (CDC) 21-1112. https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/ publications/bmbl5/bmbl.pdf. Accessed 2 Jan 2016, 2009).

There are four biosafety levels that are implemented and defined by the CDC. Each biosafety level has specific containment controls, which include microbiological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards to protect laboratory workers, the public and the environment from exposure to infectious biohazards that are used in the lab. These containment controls build on the preceding level of safety, in a pyramid-like fashion, as the risk level increases. Biosafety levels dictate the type of work practices that are allowed to occur in a lab setting and play a huge role in the design of the facility.",

Biosafety levels are an important and integral part of biohazardous communication and training for work in these facilities. Most institutions have biosafety review boards and committees that ensure that these guidelines are followed and can often address laboratory-specific questions. Clinical work involving human specimens are generally characterized under BSL2 guidelines, though oftentimes the infectious natures of clinical specimens are unknown. BSL2 level of compliance aligns well with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (the oversight body for enforcement of safety and health legislation) standard when working with specimens that contain blood or blood traces [2] . Strict adherence to guidelines and suggestions given by the CDC will help communicate a safer workspace and promote compliance in the laboratory. This chapter addresses biosafety level distinction and classification in a standard laboratory but does not address the specific guidelines that are given for vertebrate animal biosafety level criteria. A thorough and comprehensive exploration of biosafety levels, safety practices, and regulatory standards for animal biosafety levels could be found in the CDC's Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories [3] .",

They are usually separate facilities that are physically disconnected from other facilities and sufficiently isolated. They build on the safety precautions and procedures of BSL1, 2, and 3 laboratories. This includes all engineering controls, safety equipment, and any special laboratory facilities. Biohazardous agents that are under BSL4 are dangerous and exotic and pose a high risk through aerosol/respiratory transmission in the laboratory that can lead to life-threatening disease and are lethal. Vaccines and treatments are generally not available for these agents. Some investigated agents in which routes of transmission remain unclear are given BSL4 designation. Examples of BSL4 hazardous agents include Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa Viruses and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. BSL4 labs differ from BSL3 labs by the specific training required by laboratory personnel and staff in handling extremely hazardous infectious agents. This is inclusive of primary and secondary containment and all standard and special practices that involve handling, manipulation, and storage of these dangerous BSL4 agents. BSL4 laboratories are divided into two types, cabinet laboratories and suit laboratories.
