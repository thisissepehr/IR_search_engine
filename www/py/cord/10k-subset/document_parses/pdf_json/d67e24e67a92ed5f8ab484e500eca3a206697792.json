In ten children rotavirus was found in the faeces and the bacteriological findings were negative, Rotavirus particles were aggregated by convalescent child sera and by normal human gamma globulin. The clinical picture was characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting and fever, in one case with febrile convulsions. Diarrhoea was watery and yellow-green, and usually persisted for four to five days. The condition of the children improved rapidly after rehydratation and a special diet. Older siblings, and in one family also adult members, were frequently affected. Zusammenfassung: Rotaviren-Gastroenteritis bei Siiuglingen und Kleinkindern. Wiihrend des Frfihjahres 1977 wurden in der Infektionsklinik in Prag elektronenoptische Untersuchungen yon Stuhlsuspensionen bei 18 Siiuglingen und Kleinkindern durchgefiihrt. Die epidemioloischen Angaben wiesen keinen Verdacht auf Salmonellosen, Shigellosen oder Coli-Infektionen auf. In zehn F~illen wurden Rotaviren nachgewiesen. Die bakteriologischen Befunde waren bei allen Kindern negativ. Rotavirus-Partikel wurden mit Kinder-Rekonvaleszentenserum und auch mit normalem humanem Gammaglobulin aggregiert. Ffir das klinische Bild waren pl6tzlicher Ausbruch mit Erbrechen und Fieber, in einem Fail mit febrilen Kriimpfen charakteristisch. Die Diarrh6e war w~isserig, gelbgriin und dauerte meistens 4 bis 5 Tage. Nach Rehydratation und Dfiit-Magnahmen erholten sich die Kinder rasch. Oft erkrankten auch die iilteren Geschwister der Kinder und in einem Fall auch die erwachsenen Familienmitglieder.",

This agent has been found in all parts of the world in sick children of all races, while it is rarely found in healthy children (1--5) . During the winter period it causes as much as 75% of the diarrhoeal diseases occurring in young children; in summer the ratio declines to approximately 20% (1, 3, 6, 7). As there has not yet been a report on the occurrence of rotavirus in Czechoslovakia, we would like to describe the first observation.",

In all children five samples of stool were collected during the first three days after admission for isolation of primary and potentially pathogenic agents. Rectal swabs were taken simultaneously on two detoxicated tampons. One of these was sent immediately to the bacteriological laboratory, and the second was placed in Stuart medium. Both specimens were cultured using standard techniques for isolation of bacterial pathogens. All cultures of Escherichia coil were serotyped. Moreover, in those children in whom, on the basis of epidemiological data, dysentery, salmonellosis or infection caused by E. coli was not suspected, we searched at the same time for viruses in faeces, using the immunoelectronmicroscopic method (8) .",

Subsequently or concomitantly the children developed abdominal pain and watery yellowishgreen diarrhoea. In children at home who were on a normal diet slightly haemorrhagic mucus was also de-tected in one to two specimens of faeces. Fever and vomiting persisted for between three and ten (average four to five) days. In two children intravenous rehydration was necessary during the first two days, in the remaining children a diet of tea, mineral water, bananas, carrot and rice soup sufficed. With this special diet the character of the stools improved rapidly. Recovery and return to a normal diet were more rapid than in other intestinal infections in children, in particular infections caused by E. coli. We did not administer antibiotics or chemotherapeutic drugs; only some children were given dichlorohydroxyquinoline. The virus particles in stool suspensions occurred either singly or in small clusters of no more than two or three particles (Figures 1 and 2) . Similar findings were also obtained after incubation of stool specimens with sera from acutely sick children. Convalescent stage sera and normal human gamma globulin, however, caused the formation of large immunocomplexes frequently consisting of up to several thousand virions (Figures 3 and 4) ,",
