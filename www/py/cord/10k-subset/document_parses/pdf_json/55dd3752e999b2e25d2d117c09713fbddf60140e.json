The unwillingness of plant virologists to accept the species category was due to two erroneous assumptions on their part. First, they assumed that the only acceptable species concept was that of biological species defined by gene pools and reproductive isolation, thereby ignoring the fact that there is no agreement at all among biologists about what a species is [10, 11, 18, 20, 22, 29, 30] .

When I said [31] that taxonomic names are not appropriate when referring to physical entities like the virions found in a preparation or seen in an electron micrograph, I was referring to the fact that [27, 28] . Virions correspond to one phase of the life cycle of a virus [32] and viruses are actually concrete entities which, however, can be members of the abstract class corresponding to a virus species [29, 30] . It is precisely because virologists continuously need to refer to concrete objects which replicate and cause disease (abstractions do not cause disease) that vernacular names will continue to be used. Tobacco plants will therefore continue to be inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus (no italics because it is a concrete object) rather than with abstractions like Tobacco mosaic virus or Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus. The need for introducing the abstract class of species in viral taxonomy and for distinguishing vernacular names from species names has been explained at length elsewhere [29, 30, 32, 33] . It is also important to distinguish between the concrete entity called a virus and a single, discrete virus particle or virion [32] . Whereas a virion possesses intrinsic biochemical and structural properties, a virus, on the other hand, possesses in addition a number of relational and emergent properties that become actualized, for instance during the viral replication cycle, when the virus forms an integrated whole with its host cell. A virus can thus not be reduced to the physical constituents and chemical composition of a virion, and it is necessary to include in its description the functional activity it possesses inside its host, as well as a variety of other biotic interactions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4, "end": 7, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 86, "end": 90, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 276, "end": 280, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 348, "end": 352, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 482, "end": 486, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 487, "end": 490, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1087, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1091, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1095, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1229, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Are viruses abstract or concrete entities?"}, {"text": "Another misconception that needs to be rectified is that the species concept and the use of binomials and Latin are appropriate in virology because viruses are organisms. The rationale for using the species concept in viral taxonomy is that viruses are biological entities and not simply chemicals. Viruses possess genes, replicate, evolve and are adapted to particular biotic habitats and ecological niches. However, viruses cannot capture and store free energy and they are not functionally active outside of their host cells. Although viruses are pathogens, they should not be confused with pathogenic microorganisms. Only cells and multicellular systems possess the emergent property of being alive and this property is not present in subcellular organelles or individual molecules. A virus becomes part of a living system only after its genome has been integrated in the host cell and viral replication is made possible through the metabolic activity of the cell. Viruses are not living organisms and they occupy a unique position in biology. Since they are not functionally active outside of their host cells, they lead only a kind of borrowed life [32, 33] . The unique position of viruses in the biological realm fully justifies the policy of the ICTV over the years not to blindly follow the traditions of biological or bacterial nomenclature. When Bos [2, 4] asserts that biological nomenclature requires that viral species names be written in a certain way and that it also requires scientific names of viruses to carry a genus affiliation, he simply refuses to acknowledge that the ICTV, as the voice of the international virological community, has been quite happy to follow its own rules and code.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1163, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viruses are not microorganisms"}, {"text": "Virologists have never accepted that they must behave in a certain way and adhere to certain rules because a Biological Nomenclature Code says so.

In a recent French textbook of viruses infecting ornamental plants [1] , the binomial system shown in Table 2 was followed throughout. In addition to the vernacular French name of each virus, the English name together with the genus designation, both in italics, served as a standard scientific designation. This textbook was written before the new ICTV Code was published [19] and the authors used italics even for names that have not been officially approved by ICTV as authorized species names. Using italics only for ICTV approved species names has the advantage that strain names (not in italics) are readily distinguished from species names. Bos [2, 4] objects to the in toto italicization of plant virus names on the grounds that it no longer allows a distinction to be made between certain vernacular plant names written in Roman characters such as nasturtium (belonging to the species Tropaeolum majus) and the Latin name Nasturtium which is a different plant species altogether. Since there are no virus species with these names (nasturtium ringspot virus is a strain of Broad bean wilt virus) his objection is a purely theoretical one.
