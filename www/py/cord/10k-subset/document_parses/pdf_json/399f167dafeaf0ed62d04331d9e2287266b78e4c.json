Technology has advanced in several fields, making genetic sequences cheaper and faster to obtain and vastly improving our ability to analyze those data through increased computing power and new analytic methods. All of this has made phylogenies based on DNA easier to build and helped to highlight the importance of a phylogenetic perspective even when molecular data are unavailable (e.g., for most, but not all, fossil organisms). There's a simple reason that phylogenies have become increasingly prevalent in textbooks and now even appear in middle school texts (Catley and Novick 2008) : phylogenies have become increasingly important in biological research and in shaping how scientists look at the natural world. To grasp modern biology, students must understand the basics of phylogenetics.",

The same text might introduce the basics of reading phylogenies by explaining the concepts of common ancestry, clades, and shared derived characters. But how can students be motivated to learn and retain this material (i.e., not hit the delete button, which Mclennan (2010a) notes so frequently happens)? Using innovative and engaging teaching activities (e.g., Kumala 2010a) and narratives can help.

But unlike a poison, HIV has genetic material (RNA) and makes copies of itself, meaning that it can evolve. In fact, because of its high mutation rate and rapid replication rate, HIV evolves remarkably quickly. While the process of speciation may take tens or hundreds of thousands of years in animals like fruit flies, HIV can diversify into many different strains within a single individual in less than a year ( Fig. 1) . As HIV evolves, it accumulates mutations in its genome-some beneficial to the virus (and likely, bad for human hosts!), some slightly deleterious to the virus, and most with no notable effect at all. Whatever their impact, those mutations record events in the lineage's history, turning the genome into something of a marked-up road map-a spotty, but informative, account of where the lineage has been at different points in its evolutionary past. This makes it possible for scientists to use the virus's RNA sequence to reconstruct the family relationships among different strains (i.e., to build a phylogeny).",

The biologists sequenced different regions of the viral RNA and used these data to build phylogenies. Figure 2 shows the phylogeny they built using part of the HIV reverse transcriptase gene. Every HIV strain sequence is different, but the phylogeny shows how they are related. The victim's sequences are most closely related to those of the doctor's HIV-positive patient and are much more distantly related to other HIV strains. Even more convincingly, the victim's sequences are nested within the clade formed by the patient's sequences; they are a subset of the patient's sequences. This is exactly what we would expect to observe if the patient was infected with HIV, the virus evolved into many different strains within him, and then the victim was infected with one of the patient's strains, and the virus continued to evolve within her. Based partly on the strength of phylogenetic evidence such as this, the doctor was convicted of attempted murder in 1998 (Vogel 1996) .",

As described above, HIV viruses evolve quickly because of their high mutation rates and short generation times-and their genetic sequences can be used to reconstruct that evolutionary history. The biologists compared the sequences from the children to many other known HIV sequences and used them to build a phylogeny (Fig. 3; de Oliveira et al. 2006) . That tree revealed that the children's viruses formed a tight-knit family-as would be expected if they stemmed from a single introduction of HIV to the hospital, which was then passed to many different patients. Based on the viral strains most closely related to the children's (one strain from Ghana and two from Fig. 1 Fruit fly populations may evolve into separate species when separated geographically from one another for thousands of years, while HIV may evolve into separate lineages within a single individual in less than a year. Illustration adapted with permission from the Understanding Evolution website Cameroon), the strain in question seems to have come from West Africa. Many West African migrants come to Libya seeking work. It seems likely that the virus was accidentally introduced to the hospital when an infected worker or a worker's infected child was treated there.",

This analysis was based on a molecular clock, the idea that in certain stretches of DNA or RNA, mutations accumulate at a reliable rate (e.g., one per year), allowing them to be used as timers: the more mutations the genetic material has accumulated, the longer since it split off from its ancestral sequence. The molecular clock analysis of the children's HIV sequences convincingly showed that the medics could not have caused the disease cluster. The medics arrived at the hospital in March of 1998. If the medics had intentionally infected the children, the first victims would have been infected after the medics' arrival-and hence, the victims' viruses would have begun to diverge from one another and from other viral lineages after March of 1998 (as shown in Scenario 1, Fig. 4 ). But when the biologists traced the family tree of the children's viruses back in time, that's not what they found. Instead they discovered a phylogeny resembling that shown in Scenario 2 (Fig. 4) ; the children's viruses were so different from one another that they must have begun diverging long before 1998. Children had been infected several years before the medics even arrived on the scene! Unfortunately, even after this evidence was introduced in a retrial, the death sentence was upheld (Bohannon 2005) . Finally, in 2007, after more than eight years of imprisonment, the medical workers were released and returned home (Bohannon 2007 ). However, their release did not come through the Libyan court system, which had repeatedly ignored scientific evidence supporting the medics' innocence, but through political maneuvering and incentives: promises of aid, trade, debt write-offs, and payments to the infected children's families.

In Japan, whale meat is considered a delicacy-one that has become harder to find since global declines in whale populations spurred international agree- ments placing tight restrictions on which whales can be hunted, how they can be brought to market, and whether their meat can be imported and exported. Does the market for whale meat in Japan encourage illegal whaling and trading of whale products? The answer is hard to figure out simply by visiting Japanese fish markets. In these markets, purported whale is often simply labeled \"whale\" without specifying the meat's species or provenance. Scott Baker and Steve Palumbi realized that phylogenetic analysis could help solve the problem. The two scientists went to Japan in 1993, visited local markets, and bought many different samples of meat labeled \"whale.\" Because of restrictions on transporting whale tissues across international borders for scientific research, the American biologists performed much of the genetic grunt work for the analysis in their hotel rooms in Japan (Angier 1994) . The researchers sequenced part of a mitochondrial gene from each meat sample, compared them to sequences from known whale populations, and used these data to build a phylogeny showing how all the sequences are related (Fig. 5; Baker and Palumbi 1994) . Many of the sequences from the \"whale\" meat are closely related to sequences from whales that cannot be sold legally in Japan. That meat likely came from protected species, although the researchers dutifully noted that some of this meat might be considered legal if it had been kept in storage since before the restrictions were enacted-between four and 27 years! In addition, the analysis suggested that some of the \"whale\" meat could be dangerous to consumers; some meat appeared to come from dolphins, which eat higher on the food chain than baleen whales and so are more likely to contain dangerous levels of mercury.",

Many of our so-called \"new\" diseases are simply old pathogens that used to infect other species but have recently evolved in ways that allow them to infect humans. HIV is perhaps the best-known example (as described in Wiley 2010), having made the leap to humans from simians many times (Fig. 6 ), but HIV is not alone.

In 2003, attention focused on cat-like mammals called civets because infected civets were discovered at a live animal market in southern China (where they are occasionally eaten and where SARS was a problem). However, further searches failed to turn up more tainted civets, suggesting that these animals were not the original source of the virus.

Each river basin happens to support four related fish species. If we want to conserve biodiversity and focus simply on the number of fish species, there is little difference between the three rivers. Now imagine that we reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among fish and build the phylogeny shown in Fig. 9 . Even though each basin contains the same number of fish species, basin C includes more distantly related species.
