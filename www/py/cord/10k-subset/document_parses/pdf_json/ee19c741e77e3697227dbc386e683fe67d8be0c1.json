Methods: Between 18 July 2017 and 31 October 2017, we surveyed the infection prevention teams of all acute care hospitals in the Netherlands. The survey instrument was based on the 'Translating Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Research into Practice' (TRIP) questionnaire and adapted to the Dutch context. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the reported regular use of CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI prevention practices as well as the hospital characteristics. Results: Out of 72 eligible hospitals, 47 (65.3%) responded. Surveillance systems for monitoring CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI were present in 17.8, 95.4, 26.2, and 77.3% of hospitals, respectively. Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been established in 91.5% of participating hospitals. For CAUTI, the majority of hospitals regularly used aseptic technique during catheter insertion (95%) and portable bladder ultrasound scanners (86.1%). Intermittent catheterization and catheter stop-orders were regularly used by 65.8 and 62.2% of hospitals. For CLABSI, all hospitals regularly used maximum sterile barrier precautions and chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis. Avoidance of the femoral site for central line insertions was regularly used by 65.9% of hospitals. Urinary catheters and central-lines impregnated with antibiotics or antiseptics were rarely used (\u2264 5%). Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of hospitals. With the exception of disposable thermometers (31.8%), all prevention practices to prevent CDI were regularly used by more than 80% of hospitals. Conclusions: Most Dutch hospitals report regular use of recommended practices for preventing CLABSI and CDI. Several specific practices to prevent CAUTI and VAP were less frequently used, however, providing an opportunity for improvement.",

HAIs are burdensome to patients, complicate treatment, prolong hospital length-of-stay, induce resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials, raise healthcare costs, and can be life-threatening [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In 2011, the estimated prevalence of HAIs in European acute care hospitals was 5.7%, affecting approximately 3.2 million patients [6] . The most commonly reported infection types were respiratory tract infections (23.5%), surgical site infections (19.6%), urinary tract infections (19%), bloodstream infections (10.7%), and gastro-intestinal infections (7.7%), of which 48% were Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [6] . Hospital surveillance in the Netherlands showed a decreasing prevalence of HAIs from 7.2% in 2008 [7] to 5.0% in 2017 [8] . Despite this decrease, point prevalence of HAIs varies considerably between Dutch hospitals, ranging from 1.5 to 6.5% [8] . The distribution of hospitals, the severity of patient case mix or infection types did not seem to explain the differences between the hospitals [8] .",

The survey instrument was forward-backward translated into Dutch by the research team with support of a bilingual translator and digitalized afterwards with LimeSurvey. Some questions were slightly modified to fit the Dutch context. These questions mainly related to hospital characteristics, job functions, and organizational structure.

            "text": "First, systems for routinely monitoring CAUTI rates, as well as the placement and the duration of urinary catheters in hospitalized patients are only present in approximately 20% of the hospitals, despite the link between urinary catheters and subsequent infection [29] . The number of hospitals that regularly use urinary catheter reminders or stop-orders and/or nurse initiated catheter discontinuation to prompt timely catheter removal is much lower (62%) than a similar process for CLABSI prevention involving the use of daily checks for whether a central line is still indicated (90%). A major difference between the prevention of CAUTI and CLABSI is that the majority of patients with central lines are admitted to an ICU. Implementing urinary catheter reminders or stop-orders hospital-wide is generally more challenging than within a specific ward. Institutional use of CAUTI prevention practices may be achieved through a hospital-wide approach focused on implementing a bundle of CAUTI preventive practices [30, 31] . Second, more than 90% of the hospitals monitored CLABSI and performed a daily check whether the presence of a central line was still indicated. This may be a reason why we observed rare use of routine central line changes in Dutch hospitals. In the Netherlands, monitoring of CLABSI is facilitated by a well-established nationwide surveillance system [32] , using strict criteria for assessing CLABSI based on the definitions from the European Centre for Disease Control [33] . Since 2009, CLABSI incidence in ICUs decreased from 4.3/1000 central line days to 1.2/1000 central line days in 2016 [34, 35] . It is likely that the national patient safety program 'Prevent harm, work safely' has contributed to this decline. A key focus of this five-year programme (2008-2012) was on the implementation of a central-line insertion and maintenance bundle [36] . The programme demonstrated that the compliance rate for the bundle element 'Daily check whether the central line is still indicated', increased from 60% to \u226580% in 2014 [37] . A recent meta-analysis by Ista and colleagues showed that the incidence of CLABSI decreased significantly after the implementation of central-line bundles, from 6.4/1000 catheter days to 2.5/ 1000 catheter days [38] . A significant proportion of patients with a central venous catheter are admitted to an ICU, and many CLABSI prevention practices have primarily been implemented in ICUs. This is reflected in the Dutch surveillance data of CLABSI incidence in non-ICUs. Between 2009 and 2016, only a small decrease in CLABSI incidence occurred within non-ICUs (from 3.5/1000 line days to 3.3/1000 line days) [34, 35] . This finding underscores the importance of also effectively implementing CLABSI infection practices outside of the ICU setting.",

            "text": "Third, VAP rates are rarely monitored by Dutch hospitals. This is probably due to the ongoing debate about which definition and criteria should be used for this complication [39, 40] . While the diagnosis of VAP is usually made on clinical, microbiological and radiological criteria, low interrater reliability and poor correlation with histopathology have been described [39, 41] . A meta-analysis of three Dutch studies on the effects of systemic antibiotics for selective digestive tract decontamination and oropharyngeal decontamination showed that both practices reduce ICU mortality and ICUacquired Gram-negative bacteraemia, without increasing antibiotic resistance [42, 43] . Based upon these findings, the use of systemic antibiotics for selective digestive tract decontamination and oropharyngeal decontamination in patients with an expected length of ICU stay of more than 48 h was included in the Dutch antibiotic policy guidelines. The results of our study reflect the broad implementation of these policy guidelines. Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of the hospitals and almost two-thirds of Dutch hospitals reported using systemic antibiotics for selective digestive tract decontamination and oropharyngeal decontamination. However, in all Dutch studies on selective digestive tract decontamination in the ICU, evaluation of VAP was performed in a research setting [43] . The remaining VAP prevention practices were only moderately implemented, perhaps as a result of the focus on selective decontamination strategies. Fourth, infection prevention practices and surveillance systems for monitoring CDI are highly implemented in Dutch hospitals. Soon after CDI outbreaks in the Netherlands in 2005, a national surveillance program for CDI was initiated to rapidly recognize CDI and prevent further spread [44] . Simultaneously, a nationwide multi-modal approach was introduced to prevent CDI, recommending: (a) restricted use of antibiotics; (b) strict enteric precautions when looking after patients with diarrhea; and (c) meticulous cleaning of clinical areas [45] . The well-implemented CDI prevention practices found in this study are therefore in line with our expectations.",

            "text": "Our findings should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, our response rate was less than 100% and the non-response could have biased our results. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the nonresponding hospitals were comparable to those of the 47 hospitals (65%) that participated in our study. We therefore believe that our results generally reflect the use of infection prevention practices by Dutch hospitals. Second, we used self-reported data of infection control professionals. Our findings on some infection prevention practices could be inaccurate if the respondent was not sufficiently aware of all actual practices. An individual respondent may have overestimated or underestimated how frequently the various practices were used [48] . However, we have thoroughly instructed respondentsboth verbally and in writing -to consult a colleague if certain infection prevention practices were beyond their scope of attention. We therefore have no reason to believe that systematic inaccuracies have occurred. Still, we cannot rule out potential response bias (e.g. recall, social-desirability) and acknowledge that respondent answers may not correlate perfectly with the actual dayto-day reality of their respective hospital. Third, as our intent was to present a cross-sectional snapshot of infection prevention in Dutch hospitals, our analyses are limited to univariate analyses. As a consequence, inferences regarding the determinants of regular use of the infection prevention practices are not provided. Finally, although we collected a considerable amount of information about the use of infection prevention practices, we do not have data on actual infection rates. As a consequence we were not able to present relationships between the use of the various infection prevention practices and infection outcomes. Nevertheless, research has shown that most of the infection prevention practices included in our study contribute substantially to reducing HAIs; such practices are generally included in published national and international guidelines.",

Given the success of such collaborative efforts to prevent CLABSI and CDI in Dutch hospitals, we anticipate that similar efforts to prevent CAUTI and VAP will also be successful.",
