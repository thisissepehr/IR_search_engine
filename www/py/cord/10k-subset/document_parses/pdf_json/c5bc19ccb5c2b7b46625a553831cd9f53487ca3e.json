Natural defense against this fungus depends primarily on cell-mediated immunity, with the CD4 + T-lymphocyte playing a central role, a finding that substantiates its increased incidence in AIDS patients. Other identified conditions that predispose patients to primary infection with or without disseminated spread are intensive and prolonged corticosteroid use, Cushing's syndrome, organ transplantation with use of immunosuppressive drugs, chronic leukemias and lymphomas, cirrhosis, and diabetes (1). Cryptococcosis has also been reported in rare primary immunodeficiencies such as idiopathic CD4 + Tlymphopenia (5), interleukin-2 deficiency (6), Job's syndrome (hyperimmunoglobulinemia E-recurrent infection (7) , and severe combined immunodeficiency (8) . Infection occurs via the respiratory route, and extrapulmonary manifestations occur as a result of hematogenous spread. While the central nervous system is the most commonly affected site in symptomatic cryptococcosis, infection with or without clinical manifestations has been reported in a wide variety of extraneurological sites, including various parts of the gastrointestinal tract.",

In our patient, there was no clinical evidence to suggest the presence of cryptococcosis outside of the jejunum. Nevertheless, in the absence of either CSF examination or systematic histological examination, the diagnosis of true isolated gastrointestinal cryptococcosis cannot be made, and we therefore cannot cite this case as evidence adding strength to the viewpoint proposing the gastrointestinal tract as a portal of entry for Cryptococcus. The histological pattern of uniform, diffuse infection of the entire gut wall and serosa might be an indication of hematogenous spread, but might also be the result of contiguous spread through necrotic tissue and seeding of the serosa by way of the perforation.",
