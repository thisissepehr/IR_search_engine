(16) LPS challenge also activates neutrophils and macrophages within the lung vasculature, which exaggerates production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical. (17, 18) They are believed to contribute to the severity of several diseases, including ALI and ARDS. The increased ROS will induce lipid peroxidation and alter antioxidant enzyme activity, (17, 19) resulting in increased pulmonary vascular permeability and the release of inflammatory cell in BALF. (20) Thus, ROS is believed to be crucial in the induction of lung damage caused by pneumonia, while therapeutic agents that could effectively scavenge ROS may prevent or reduce the deleterious effects of pneumonia.",

It has been widely used to treat common cold, cough, acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) and acute bronchitis in clinic. Clinical studies reported that RDN was safe and effective in curing pneumonia in the elderly population (21) and also had good therapeutic effect to AURI in children. (22) At the same time, it was reported to be used as a new drug for prophylactic treatment to Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and infl uenza virus in clinic. (23) However, there is little experimental data regarding the effects of RDN on inflammation. The present study was undertaken in rats to evaluate the effects of RDN on ALI induced by bacterial LPS through examining cellular infiltration and histological changes in the lungs. compounds were identified by spectrophotometer (Waters, USA), mass spectrometer (Bruker, USA), and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) spectrometer (Bruker, USA). As illustrated in Figure  1 , the compounds of the main peaks on the HPLC fingerprint were identified as neochlorogenic acid (peak 1, t R 8.3 min), chlorogenic acid (peak 2, t R 13.0 min), cryptochlorogenic acid (peak 3, t R 14.4 min), secologanic acid (peak 4, t R 15.8 min), caffeic acid (peak 5, t R 17.1 min), geniposide (peak 6, t R 18.6 min), secologanin (peak 7, t R 26.1 min), isochlorogenic acid B (peak 8, t R 29.2 min), isochlorogenic acid C (peak 9, t R 29.0 min), and isochlorogenic acid A (peak 10, t R 35.1 min).",

As a major stimulus for the release of cytokines, LPS challenge can induce inflammatory responses by activating numerous infl ammatory cells, which are commonly found in ALI patients. (24) ALI is characterized by increased capillary permeability, interstitial and alveolar edema, and infl ux of circulating inflammatory cells. (25) In the present study, results showed that LPS challenge increased lung W/D ratio, infl ammatory cells migration into the lung, and protein leakage in BALF. Histological examination also demonstrated that LPS exposure showed a thickening of the alveolocapillary membrane and massive extravagation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the alveolar spaces. The results above confi rmed that LPS challenge elevated the capillary permeability and induced the pulmonary edema, which are the major characters of ALI. (26) Pretreatment with RDN greatly improved the alteration of pulmonary histology by LPS, decreased lung W/D ratio, prevented the RDN has been commonly used for relieving cough and acute bronchitis in clinic for years. H P L C a n a l y s i s i n d i c a t e d t h a t R D N m a i n l y contained neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, secologanin and geniposide. High levels of chlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic a c i d c a n r e d u c e M o n i l i n i a l a x a i n f e c t i o n . (27) Chlorogenic acid was also demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities and its isomers exhibited strong antioxidant activities. (28, 29) Geniposide has been reported to protect mice against LPS-induced ALI, (30) inhibit the production of ROS and down-regulate LPS-elevated iNOS expression. (31) These active components in RDN could possibly contribute to the alleviation of lung inflammation on LPS-induced ALI. The sign of pulmonary inflammation in ALI is the presence of infiltrating leukocytes. Excessive infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, which are predominant inflammatory cells and play key roles in the early development of ALI, is found in lung of rats challenged with LPS. When ALI occurs, neutrophils adhere to the injured capillary endothelium and migrate into the air spaces. The activated neutrophils will release oxidants, proteases, and other inflammatory mediators. (32) It is the adhesion and activation of neutrophils that causes lung injury.",

            "text": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines appear in the early phase of an inflammatory response and contribute to the severity of lung injury. (37) A network of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 and chemokines is critical for initiating, amplifying, and perpetuating the inflammatory response in ALI. LPS triggers monocytes and macrophages to produce several inflammatory cytokines and mediators, as well as biological mediators involved in the control of pathogens. TNF-\u03b1 plays a key role in stimulating a variety of chemokine production and activation of neutrophils. Activated neutrophils will generate oxygen radicals, (38) which can induce lipid peroxidation and cause serious damage to cellular structure and functions. (39) Besides, the over-production of nitric oxide (NO) induced by iNOS may lead to both direct and indirect cytotoxic effects on endothelial cells via the formation of peroxynitrite, and lead to increased pulmonary microvascular permeability. (40, 41) We observed that LPS challenge led to the elevation of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS gene expressions in lungs. Besides, we also found that LPS challenge decreased the activity of SOD in lungs of rats. However, preadministration of RDN markedly reduced gene expressions of TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and increased the activity of SOD in lungs of rats treated with LPS. These results suggested that the protective effect was due to the down-regulation of cytokine expressions in the lungs of rats. O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , N F -\u03ba B i s a c a p i t a l transcription factor for a number of inflammatory mediators that are involved in the pathogenesis of ALI. (42) It is normally located in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through being associated with an inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) protein. (43) Following activation, I\u03baB protein breaks down and liberates NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus where it binds to promoter regions of target genes, and eventually induces the expressions of infl ammatory cytokines and mediators. (44) In our study, the results showed that LPS induced an elevation of NF-\u03baB gene expression and protein expression in lungs. RDN pretreatment could inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB induced by LPS in rat lung tissues. It was suggested that the inhibitory effects of RDN on proinfl ammatory cytokine expressions in the lung tissues of ALI rats were related to down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activation.",

Rats were challenged with intravenous injection of LPS 1 h after intraperitoneal treatment with RDN or DEX. At 6 h after LPS challenge, lung tissues and bronchoalveolar after intraperitoneal treatment with RDN or DEX. At 6 h after LPS challenge, lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid (BALF) were collected, and the number of infl ammatory cells was determined. The right lungs were lavage fl uid (BALF) were collected, and the number of infl ammatory cells was determined.

Results Results: : In vivo In vivo pretreatment of RDN (360, 720 mg/kg) signifi cantly pretreatment of RDN (360, 720 mg/kg) signifi cantly reduced the weight of wet to dry (W/D) ratio of lung, protein content in BALF, and led to remarkable attenuation reduced the weight of wet to dry (W/D) ratio of lung, protein content in BALF, and led to remarkable attenuation of LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lungs. Meanwhile, RDN enormously decreased BALF total of LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lungs. Meanwhile, RDN enormously decreased BALF total infl ammatory cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers. Moreover, RDN increased SOD activity, infl ammatory cells, especially neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers. Moreover, RDN increased SOD activity, inhibited MPO activity, alleviated LPS-induced tumor neurosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and inducible nitric oxide inhibited MPO activity, alleviated LPS-induced tumor neurosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and inducible nitric oxide",
