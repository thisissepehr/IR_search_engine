Advances in DNA synthetic methods have enabled the generation of large populations of degenerate oligodeoxynucleotides, while PCR allows small numbers of molecules to be amplified into amounts that can be readily manipulated by researchers. When these two advances were iteratively coupled with the ability to partition oligonucleotides on the basis of their binding or catalytic activities, in vitro selection of functional nucleic acids (termed SELEX) was born 5, 6 .

This is possibly because protein active sites offer more exposed heteroatoms for hydrogen bonding and other interactions. Another explanation is that aptamers have a limited number of interactions that they can make with a protein target, and therefore aptamers that 'fit' into a crevice on a protein, such as an active site, are more likely to be selected (the so-called homing principle). most therapeutically useful aptamers tend to inhibit protein-protein interactions, such as receptor-ligand interactions, and thereby function as antagonists. However, at least some aptamers have been shown to have agonist-like activities. For example, aptamers isolated against the extracellular domain of the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3; also known as ERBB3) can promote oligomerization (although this does not result in inhibition of downstream phosphorylation) 16 .

Therefore, as with many other drugs, the key features of aptamers that must be optimized for drug development include high affinity and specificity, and a long half-life in the relevant biological compartment. SELEX protocols have now been developed to increase target affinity (by decreasing off-rates) and to increase specificity 18 . For example, specificity can be selected for by using a specific subdomain of a protein as a target, or by immobilizing the target using a specific method or affinity tag 9 . Iteratively toggling or switching between multiple targets during selection (for example, between the full-length protein and a specific subdomain) can drive binding to a particular epitope 19 .

Accordingly, most SELEX experiments for therapeutics use oligonucleotides that are chemically modified in some manner. These approaches rely on DNA or RNA polymerases that can accept appropriately modified nucleotide triphosphates as substrates. modified nucleotides can be introduced into libraries before initiation of SELEX by polymerases that can accept modified nucleotide triphosphates. This process can yield aptamers that are partially or completely substituted with one or more modifications, including 2\u2032-amino pyrimidines [22] [23] [24] , 2\u2032-fluoro pyrimidines [25] [26] [27] , and 2\u2032-O-methyl ribose purines and pyrimidines 28, 29 (fIG. 1a) . Internucleotide linkages can also be modified (for example, phosphorothioate linkages) 30 polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be conjugated to the 5\u2032-terminus. Finally, a wealth of chemistries are available by modifying nucleobases (for example, the 5-position of uridine 33 ). The presence of these modified nucleotides stabilizes oligonucleotides against nucleasemediated degradation, and imparts greater affinities to selected aptamers. So far, the highest affinity aptamers that have been reported in the literature contain modified nucleotides and bind in the single-digit picomolar range (see REf. 22 for an example). The choice of RNA versus DNA, and sugar, phosphate and nucleobase modifications is largely driven by the need for stability; however, a finer appreciation of how these modifications affect function is for the most part still needed. For a fuller review of this topic see REf. 18 . Spiegelmers [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] are aptamers in which the sugars are the enantiomers (non-identical mirror images) of wildtype nucleic acid sugars. In the case of RNA Spiegelmers, the oligonucleotide backbone is composed entirely of l-riboses linked by phosphodiesters. Because nucleases are highly stereoselective these molecules are several orders of magnitude more nuclease-resistant than the corresponding wild-type RNA (d-ribose) sequences. SELEX cannot be performed with l-ribonucleotides directly because wild-type RNA polymerases will not accept l-ribonucleotide triphosphates as substrates and it is not yet technically feasible to prepare enantiomeric RNA polymerases (d-amino acids). Instead, wild-type RNA SELEX is performed using the enantiomer of the desired target. The sequences of wild-type RNA transcripts that bind to the enantiomer of the desired target, will, when prepared synthetically with l-ribose, bind to the desired target in the same manner. A significant limitation in the Spiegelmer approach is that enantiomeric targets need to be prepared synthetically, and so only relatively small protein domains or peptides can be used.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 678, "end": 682, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 683, "end": 687, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 722, "end": 726, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 727, "end": 731, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 781, "end": 784, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 785, "end": 787, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 887, "end": 889, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1068, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1400, "text": "REf. 22", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1696, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1715, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1720, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1725, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1730, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1735, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1740, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1745, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1755, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1760, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1765, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 788, "end": 797, "text": "(fIG. 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Nucleotide"}, {"text": "Despite the fact that aptamers are discovered using an enzymatic process, aptamers are ultimately generated for therapeutic applications by chemical synthesis.

These modifications include phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages; non-deoxyribose sugars such as ribose, 2\u2032-fluoro-ribose and 2\u2032-O-methyl ribose; and oligonucleotide terminal caps, such as inverted nucleotides (fIG. 1c) or cholesterol. In addition, the process of chemical synthesis allows the site-specific introduction of non-nucleotide linkers (such as hexaethylene glycol), the introduction of chemical functionalities useful for conjugation (such as primary amines, thiol precursors and aldehyde precursors), and the addition of fluorescent or other reporter moieties (fIG. 1d). In particular, the site-specific placement of functional groups for conjugation means that the modification of aptamers after the solid-phase step (for example with high molecular mass PEG 46 ) leads to products with discrete stoichiometries and defined chemical structures.

However, there are few circulating nucleic acids from which similar comparisons can be drawn. Conversely, even though aptamers are chemicals, as outlined above, they are large by the standards of traditional non-protein drugs and do not readily cross biological barriers such as cell membranes. Thus, many of the general rules that are typically applied by medicinal chemists during drug development do not apply to aptamers. most targets for therapeutic aptamers are either in solution in the blood plasma or displayed on the surface of cells that are accessible from the blood plasma, such as on the surface of the vasculature.

Although high-affinity aptamers can be selected against numerous targets, the selection method itself is often labour intensive and time consuming. To further advance the number and types of aptamers available for therapeutic applications, it will be necessary to develop selection methods that are more high-throughput and to ensure that selected aptamers have exceedingly high affinities and are, or can be engineered to be, resistant to degradation and clearance. There have been several approaches to these goals. One option is to automate the selection process so that aptamers can be reproducibly generated. In an early study, the adaptation of aptamer selection protocols to liquid-handling robots was attempted 88 . At a rate of 12 rounds of selection every 2 days, successful selections were achieved in just under 1 week 89 . Aptamers have also been robotically selected against a human protein, u1A, coordinately produced in vitro 90 . The Klussmann group at NOXXON Pharma took automation a step further by directly monitoring PCR and quantifying the amount of nucleic acid bound to the target 36 .

However, the most extensive work that has been done with high-throughput discovery methods for aptamers is that by the company Somalogic, where investigators recently reported the selection of 498 aptamers and their use to simultaneously interrogate blood samples 93 . Somalogic has pioneered the use of modified bases for SELEX, as opposed to just modified sugars (for example, 2\u2032-O-methyl) or modified internucleotide linkages (for example, phosphorothioate). It is likely that their success in identifying multiple, highaffinity aptamers against many different targets is in part due to the fact that they have capitalized on the dizzying range of modifications at the 5-position of uridine originally developed and reported by Eaton's group 33,94-96 . most reported initiatives that try to streamline the discovery process of therapeutic aptamers focus only on the selection and amplification steps. Although it is possible that microelectromechanical systems 91 , deep sequencing 97 or computational prediction 98 will accelerate the identification of aptamers, it seems likely that 'analogue' predictions (selection itself) will greatly outperform such efforts for some time to come. In any event, once selection is complete the library is cloned and sequenced, and multiple individual clones are assessed for binding to, and inhibition of, the desired target protein. Clones are ranked and this is followed by the truncation of the best performing aptamers, often dispensing with flanking sequence elements or internal loops that are not required for function. This is in turn followed by structure-activity relationship analyses in which the introduction of individual sequence or chemical substitutions yields variants that may have improved nuclease resistance and inhibitory activity. Finally, conjugation of the aptamer to PEG or cholesterol leads to reduced renal filtration rates in animal models in which therapeutic potency is ultimately assessed.

Biotinlabelled aptamers were conjugated to biotin-labelled siR-NAs via streptavidin 124 , or aptamers were hybridized to siRNAs 125 . In both instances, specific targeting of siRNAs to LNCaP cells relative to PC3 cells was observed. The Sullenger group showed that siRNA conjugates could silence two survival genes that are commonly overexpressed in human tumours, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and BCL-2. more importantly, intratumoral injections of aptamer-siRNA chimeras into LNCaP xenografts reduced tumour volume, whereas a scrambled aptamer (still bearing the correct siRNA) did not. No interferon response was elicited with aptamer-siRNA constructs, despite the fact that the aptamers contained significant duplex structures. The Giangrande group at the university of Iowa, uSA, followed up on these results by further optimizing the aptamer-siRNA chimera 126 . Several standard options for improving siRNA processing were introduced into the original construct, and the identification of a cell line amenable to uptake enabled the demonstration of efficacy after systemic administration 126 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 284, "end": 288, "text": "122,", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 289, "end": 292, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 471, "end": 474, "text": "124", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 515, "end": 518, "text": "125", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1249, "text": "126", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1481, "text": "126", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 373, "end": 384, "text": "(fIG. 4b-d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "PLGA"}, {"text": "Aptamer-siRNA chimeras have also been generated by fusing the HIv gp120-specific aptamer and a tat/revspecific siRNA.

All seven of the mice treated by intratumoral injection survived and showed reductions in tumour volume, compared with the survival of only four out of seven mice in a control group that was treated with drugencapsulated nanoparticles lacking the PSmA-specific aptamer. Some efficacy was also demonstrated with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin delivered to tumour cells via aptamer functionalized PLGA-PEG nanoparticle conjugates 130, 131 . Similarly, a nucleolin-specific aptamer was conjugated to a liposome that encased the potent chemotherapeutic cisplatin and led to delivery of the drug to tumours 132 .

It is also true that at some level the relatively small number of therapeutic advances and clinical trials that have been undertaken is a result of the relatively small number of companies that can participate in aptamer development. As the earliest aptamer intellectual property begins to expire, it is anticipated that more companies will join the throng, and among the more promising future possibilities is the emergence of escort aptamers for therapeutic siRNAs to which it is conjugated.
