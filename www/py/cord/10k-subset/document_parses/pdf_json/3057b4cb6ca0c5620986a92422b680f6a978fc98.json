We used this novel pulse morphological template matching (PMTM) algorithm to study 1) the incidence of cerebral vasoconstriction/vasodilatation associated with LPR increase episodes; 2) how likely cerebral vasoconstriction/vasodilatation could lead to or lag behind LPR increase. We studied 4318 Microdialysis data samples collected in an average interval of 1.3 hours from 30 severe TBI patients. The LPR increase episodes were automatically identified using a moving time-window of 4 hours.

It is still unclear what the pathophysiological and cellular mechanisms and predictors of post-traumatic edema are. The exponential growth in genetic information has opened an avenue for investigation in traumatic brain injury and implicated specific genes in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic injury edema. Two examples are the Aquaporin-4 and CACNA1 genes, which respectively encode water and calcium channels. The Aquaporin-4 gene on chromosome 18q11.2-12.1 encodes the Aquaporin-4 protein (AQP4) water channel. AQP4 is one of the bidirectional high capacity water channels that is primarily expressed in astrocytic foot processes in the central nervous system at the blood-brain barrier and is thought to be critical for brain water homeostasis. Experimental studies showed that AQP4 deficient mice had significantly reduced cerebral edema and better survival in a water intoxication model. The CACNA1 gene on chromosome 19p13 encodes the a1A subunit of a neuronal calcium channel. Patients with Familial Hemiplegic Migraine and delayed fatal cerebral edema and seizures from minor trauma have been found to have mutations in CACNA1, which are hypothesized to enhance development of cytotoxic edema. A missense mutation is reported to enhance risk of delayed fatal cerebral edema. Hypothesis: The CACNA1 gene missense mutation S218L and AQP4 polymorphisms will be over-represented in patients with post-traumatic cerebral edema.",

However, the BSAS cannot identify microshivering which is visually undetectable shivering that is thought to have the same detrimental physiologic consequences as shivering. Continuous 21 channel EEG (cEEG) can detect microshivering but is labor intensive, requires specialized training to interpret results and is expensive.

In addition, sequencing of the virus confirmed a variant found in canines in Brazil.

Because the viral genotype has not been previously identified among animals in the United States, this case represents the longest confirmed human rabies incubation in the United States to date.

The patient of the present report had arterial venous malformations followed by hemorrhagic stroke, which caused elevated intracranial pressure. The objective is to show an example of the effect of IVT PolyB in a patient with meningoencephalitis infection by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa), that are common in the ICU. A literature review was made on the subject of therapy with PolyB about the pharmacological characteristics, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. A comparative table of the resistance profile of the strain treated in this study was created, with the intrinsic resistance of the species. Also, the development of liquor evolution (culture and routine) of the patient before the treatment was monitored, until negative liquor. The effectiveness of EVD, the colonizer germ and monitoring of the serial aspects of the liquor were analyzed.",

Serum BG=392mg/d, and CSF glucose=16mg/dL. 1 month after antibiotic treatment, she was following commands. Repeat MRI revealed complete resolution of leptomeningeal enhancement. During recovery, she developed sudden onset stupor with left facial movements, and underwent cVEEG monitoring.

During cVEEG, TW activity increased in rhythmicity and frequency, coinciding with worsening hypoglycemia, with a nadir BG=14mg/dL. Electrographic activity was not induced or exacerbated by stimulation. Administration of 50 ml of D50 (25 g D-glucose) resulted in transient resolution of TWs within minutes, which corresponded to a BG=64mg/dL.

In one instance, the aneurysm ruptured during removal of the anterior clinoid process. In 4 cases, blunt rather than sharp dissection was being employed. In 3 cases, bipolar electrocautery and gentle tamponade successfully sealed the rupture point. In 2 cases, a clip placed across the bleeding site well up on the dome of the aneurysm controlled the bleeding and allowed for completion of the dissection and proper clipping. In the last case, the administration of adenosine was utilized to stop the bleeding and allow for proper clip placement. Intraoperative angiography confirmed adequate aneurysm obliteration in each case. There were no clinical consequences associated with these intraoperative ruptures.",

We present our findings using quantitative analysis of DTI scans in patients with TBI.Subjects were recruited from our NSICU, MRI sequences were performed on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio scanner as soon as the patients was able to tolerate scanning. The MRIStudio suite of programs was used to perform non-linear Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping registration to a single-subject, skull-stripped MNI atlas. Fractional Anisotropy(FA), Trace, Axial Diffusion, and Radial Diffusion were calculated and automatically segmented into 176 regions after the affine transformations and iterative registration to the atlas. 14 regions were selected for further analyses based on their segmentation accuracy and biological significance. Inclusion Criteria: Age 18-65, proxy consent available, no pre-existing neurological or psychiatric illness, TBI, GCS<13, able to safely undergo MRI within the first 21 days.

Transfused patients had longer median ICU and hospital length of stay (19 vs. 11 days, 24 vs. 15 days, respectively) and most often discharged to rehabilitation facility (54.8% vs. 42%, p<0.001).

Adjusting for key predictors, direct admit patients spent 3.9 fewer days in the ICU compared to transferred patients (t=-2.7, p=0.009). Multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of vasospasm was significantly higher for transfer patients (OR 3.46, CI: 1.2-10.3, p = 0.03).
