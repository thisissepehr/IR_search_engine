Agricultural intensification has been proposed as a major underlying cause of pathogen emergence from wildlife and domestic animal populations into human populations [2, 3] ; however, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs have rarely been demonstrated. Specific agricultural practices may increase frequency of cross-species pathogen transmission, setting the stage for persistence of new pathogens to occur. Pathogen introduction into a partially immune population-such as a population where some individuals are vaccinated or were previously infected-can result in longer and potentially larger epidemics than introduction into a naive population [4] . We refer to this phenomenon as immunity-based, population-level 'priming' for persistence. The potential of such priming to drive zoonotic emergence has been demonstrated theoretically in the general case [4] , as a possible precursor to measles emergence [5] and as a mechanism that could facilitate widespread emergence of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry [6] . Here, we present evidence that this process is not only theoretically possible but is likely to have played a key role in the first known outbreak of Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis, and therefore for the emergence of a lethal zoonosis.",

Serology, virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction detection indicate that NiV is maintained in Pteropus spp. fruit bats (flying foxes), including P. vampyrus and P. hypomelanus in peninsular Malaysia [10] [11] [12] . Transmission from flying foxes to pigs is thought to occur via saliva on fomites (discarded fruit pulp) or via faecal or urine contamination of pigsties [11] . Pigs act as amplifier hosts, enabling infection of humans via droplet transmission during respiratory infections [13] . The risk of direct transmission from bats to humans in Malaysia is believed to be low [14] .",

Initial human cases were seen in Tambun village and surrounding areas in Perak State, followed by a large epidemic in the southern states of Negeri Sembilan and Selangor and several cases in Singapore (figure 1a). The majority of these cases occurred in pig farmers and abattoir workers [17] . During the course of the outbreak investigation, nine cases of NiV encephalitis were retrospectively diagnosed in the Tambun area with onset dates between January 1997 and May 1998, five of which were associated with the index farm of the 1998 -1999 outbreak in Perak (figure 1a). Six of the nine cases are considered confirmed cases on the basis of serological tests performed in 1999 [16] ; the remaining three are probable cases.",

One of us (K.B.C., see group author list) hypothesized that this atmospheric haze caused atypical flying fox immigration from Sumatra across the Straits of Malacca into peninsular Malaysia and northward towards Perak [18] . This hypothesized movement of flying foxes into an area with large pig farms potentially outside the species' normal range was proposed to have precipitated transmission of the virus from bats to pigs. However, a retrospective diagnosis of human NiV encephalitis cases on the index farm in early 1997 indicates that bat-to-pig transmission did not result from these specific environmental conditions. In particular, seven of these cases occurred prior to the rise in airborne particulate matter that is diagnostic of the haze event, which peaked in September 1997 [18] . The recognition of cases prior to the haze event refutes the hypothesis that this event drove initial cross-species transmission (table 1) . Furthermore, at the time of the major outbreak in pigs and humans, NiV antibodies were found to be widespread in flying fox colonies within peninsular Malaysia [12] , suggesting that the outbreak was not the result of a (recent) point source introduction of the virus into the bat population, as previously suggested [18] .",

The marked decline in both end-of-year standing pig population (SPP) and annual mango production between 1998 and 1999 indicates that this correlation may reflect widespread dual use of agricultural land to produce both pigs and mangoes, with the decline in commercial mango harvest reflecting the widespread abandonment and culling of infected pig farms that occurred in the first half of 1999 (following the discovery of NiV).

            "text": "2.2.1. Dynamic models. We analysed pig production data from the index farm and developed an agestructured model of NiV dynamics within the farm population. Our model shows that multiple transmission events from bats to pigs are the best explanation for the observed pattern of human cases and pig mortality. As piglets aged in the index farm, they were moved from the breeding sections into the growing section, and finally into the finishing section for the last six weeks before they were sent to slaughter. When the virus was initially introduced into the pig population, individuals entering the growing section were immunologically naive. As the virus spread throughout the farm, the proportion of pigs entering this section with active immunity increased to the point where too few susceptibles remained for the chain of transmission to continue, and the virus could not be maintained within the farm population (figure 2a,c). The first, rapid epizootic of NiV in the pig population on the index farm thus would have produced highly localized human infections (figure 1a) and the virus most probably went extinct in the pig population at this time (figures 2a,c and 3). Our models suggest that, when NiV was reintroduced to the farm, it circulated enzootically until the farm was depopulated in March 1999 (figures 2 and 3). This finding is consistent with the timing of human cases associated with the index farm and with the high antibody prevalence detected in sows and piglets in Breeding section 2 upon depopulation of the index farm [31] . The change in dynamics between initial and subsequent introductions of the virus on the index farm results from the presence of acquired immunity in the sow population and conferred immunity in the young pig population. The age structure within the growing section, along with its rapid turnover and large population size, allowed the virus to circulate enzootically. On reintroduction of the virus into the growing section, the population had a different immunological profile from the time of initial introduction. Many young pigs moving from the breeding sections into the growing section now carried maternally derived passive immunity rather than active immunity obtained from exposure to the virus (figure 2b). We estimate that maternal antibodies are lost at approximately 14 weeks of age (electronic supplementary material). Pigs born with maternal antibodies would therefore become susceptible to the virus roughly four weeks after entering the growing section, where they would remain for another six weeks. These dynamics produce a steady inflow of susceptible individuals, which is sufficient to maintain the virus over a period of 2 years or more ( figure 2b,d) , a period similar to that observed between the index case for NiV in Malaysia in 1997 and the onset of the large-scale outbreak. The population size and turnover rate of the finishing section suggest that it may also have permitted enzootic circulation of the virus (electronic supplementary material). Stochastic simulations demonstrate that priming for persistence on the index farm is the most likely scenario consistent with pig and human epidemiology for R 0 values .2.5 (up to R 0 \u00bc 30, the highest value examined), and simulations with an R 0 value in this range best reproduce the very high seroprevalence (.95% for sows and . 90% for piglets) detected in Breeding section 2 at the time of depopulation [31] (electronic supplementary material).",

The virus appears to have spread into each of the three breeding sections between December 1996 and February 1997, with strong evidence of infection (unusually high piglet mortality) in at least two of the breeding sections (Breeding Nucleus and Breeding section 2) during January 1997, and significant mortality on a number of subsequent occasions, following an interim period in which piglet mortality returned to baseline levels (figure 1b and electronic supplementary material).",

            "text": "NiV emergence in Malaysia occurred in two phases, and our current understanding of the processes leading to its emergence is outlined in figure 5 . Phase I of emergence, the occurrence of human cases, required that only two criteria be met: circulation of the virus in a local bat population and the existence of a pathway for transmission from Pteropus bats to pigs. In phase I, early human cases were directly linked to the transmission of virus from bats to pigs, with all identified cases occurring in the immediate vicinity of the index farm where bat-to-pig transmission ignited rapid pig-to-pig transmission and produced a tight cluster of human cases on the index farm and an adjacent property. Phase II of emergence, incident human cases outside the area of transmission from flying foxes, required that the criteria for phase I be met but also mandated the existence of a pathway for transmission to humans that had become unlinked from the wildlife reservoir. In principle, several scenarios could have produced such a pathway, as illustrated in figure 5 ; however, the evidence amassed here indicates that the causal pathway realized (highlighted in dark blue). Alternative pathways that would have been sufficient to produce both phases of emergence-had they occurred-are indicated by dashed arrows. Specifically, introduction of Nipah virus into an area with extremely dense pigfarming activity (such as Port Dickson in Negeri Sembilan or Sabang Perai Utara in Pulau Penang) probably could have resulted in viral persistence without priming and reintroduction. However, these areas lacked factors further up the causal pathway: the absence of Pteropus bats in these areas prevented viral introduction prior to the establishment of an alternative source of infection (e.g. persistent viral circulation on the index farm in Kinta, Perak). Similarly, if Nipah virus in Malaysia had resulted in human-to-human transmission, an alternative causal pathway could have produced incident human cases outside the area of transmission from flying foxes, as was seen in the Faridpur outbreak in Bangladesh in 2004 [34] , but there is no evidence that such human-to-human transmission occurred in Malaysia [35] . The causal pathway that was realized in Malaysia most probably involved (i) the creation of a pathway for transmission from bats to pigs via agricultural intensification (i.e. dual-use agriculture, or the practice of planting fruit trees on land used for livestock production, and increased fruit production through time) and (ii) repeated introduction of the virus into a high-turnover commercial pig population in Perak that led to viral persistence and set the stage for phase II of the emergence process. FF, flying fox. some years after the maturation of the mango trees owing to chance events within the system, e.g. fruit bat population dynamics, migratory behaviour or the dynamics of NiV in bat populations. This is supported by our own work on Hendra virus which suggests that, when the virus is actively transmitted within a bat colony, there is a heightened chance of repeated spillover, but circulation of the virus in bats is unlikely at any given place and time [36] . On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that specific local conditions in late 1996 and early to mid-1997 caused increased viral shedding among bats in the area surrounding the index farm, thereby increasing the risk of cross-species transmission to pigs. Given the high mobility of flying foxes and the seasonal fluctuation in colony sizes in peninsular Malaysia [33] , NiV is probably transmitted regularly between roost sites and throughout the region. Such dynamics explain the ubiquity of NiV antibodies, and our data suggest that flying foxes and possibly NiV were regularly present near the index farm in Perak prior to the 1998 -1999 outbreak. Thus, we propose that it is plausible that flying foxes repeatedly introduced the virus onto the index farm in 1997.",

Furthermore, the lack of human cases on other farms between the time that this epizootic would have burned out and the reappearance of human cases associated with the index farm strongly suggests that the virus was not circulating on farms in the surrounding area in the interim. The short duration of this initial epizootic appears to have provided an insufficient window of time for transportation of pigs between farms to spread the infection. On the other hand, reintroduction of the virus into the 'primed' pig population on the index farm provided a substantially longer window of opportunity for spread. Our model's results indicate that reintroduction of the virus at the time of the reappearance of human cases on the index farm would have permitted enzootic circulation of the virus until the farm was culled in 1999.",

Subsequent pig movement (including 'fire sales' of pigs in reaction to the cluster of human cases in September-November 1998) allowed the virus to spread throughout Perak and eventually south to Negeri Sembilan and Selangor [15] . Because there was no evidence of transmission between humans [35] , the pattern of human infection necessarily followed the spread of the virus in pigs, explaining why human cases were much more widespread in 1998 -1999 than in 1997. In addition, the high density of pig farms in many parts of the south (electronic supplementary material) may have allowed respiratory transmission of the virus between adjacent farms without physical movement of infected pigs, contributing to the rapid spread of infection and high number of human cases in the south. On the other hand, these areas were buffered from phase I emergence via bat-to-pig transmission by the absence of flying foxes in the area [33] ( figure 4) and, possibly, a lesser degree of overlap between fruit and pig production (electronic supplementary material).",

Each of these component causes was brought about by a phenomenon that-while not strictly necessary-did ultimately permit emergence in this context. We refer to these factors as 'drivers' of emergence, and table 1 outlines the evidence for interpreting each of these drivers as a causal factor. Agricultural intensification (namely, dual use of agricultural land and increases in production) resulted in the direct overlap of mango production and livestock rearing and therefore produced a pathway for a virus circulating in flying foxes to infect an intensively managed commercial pig population, driving phase I of emergence. Because NiV had a very low probability of persisting on the index farm without reintroduction (figure 3), priming for persistence was necessary to bring about enzootic circulation in this context and appears to have been sufficient to do so, driving phase II of emergence.",

First, although restrictions on planting fruit trees near pigsties appear to have prevented introduction of the virus into pig populations in Malaysia since 1999, there is a possibility of reintroduction both there and in other countries where flying foxes are found. Regular surveillance of pigs sent to markets and abattoirs in areas where pig farming overlaps flying fox distributions, along with hospital-based surveillance of encephalitis cases, may permit identification of initial NiV introductions and allow for early intervention and prevention of subsequent spread. Second, widespread prophylactic vaccination of pig populations is likely to be cost-prohibitive because of the rapid turnover of commercial pig populations. In addition, if vaccine coverage were not kept at a sufficient level, the dynamics of the virus when introduced into the population would resemble those following reintroduction on the index farm, inducing long-term persistence and increasing the risk of phase II emergence (electronic supplementary material).",

Other pathogens are noticed relatively quickly because they cause dramatic disease (e.g. Ebola haemorrhagic fever); however, even in these situations, we cannot rule out the possibility of previous undocumented cases, and the discovery of historical cases after the identification of an emerging pathogen is common (NiV [16] , SARS [42] , HIV [38] and H5N1 influenza [43] ).",

Models of infection dynamics were then constructed by building on these baseline population models. Dynamics were explored using a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model with a cutoff value of one infected individual (calculated as the sum of individuals in all exposed and infectious classes), below which the infection was considered to have gone extinct. A stochastic individual-based model (IBM) was then used to confirm that the qualitative dynamics observed in the ODE model were robust to the incorporation of empirically derived waiting time distributions and other factors that could not be represented in the ODE framework. The stochastic model was run for a wide range of parameter combinations to assess the probability of extinction following initial and subsequent introductions under different scenarios and to assess the range of transmission parameters consistent with observed seroprevalence levels in Breeding section 2.

A baseline model for pre-weaning piglet mortality was formulated for each breeding section on the basis of production records from 1 January 1995 through 31 October 1996, and candidate models were compared by Akaike information criterion. For all litters born after this period, a piglet mortality index (PMI) was calculated that indicates the extent to which the observed mortality deviates from the expected mortality for a litter of the same size during the baseline period. Litter-level data are shown in the electronic supplementary material.",

In figure 1b, the binned PMI values are scaled in terms of the binned PMI percentile (relative to variation within the parametrization period). Absolute values and further details of the analysis are shown in the electronic supplementary material. We collaborated with the federal wildlife department and enlisted a network of sport hunters as informants to locate and monitor flying fox roost locations throughout peninsular Malaysia. A full description of census techniques (and additional findings) has been published elsewhere [33] . We also developed two indices of flying fox density based on different expectations for how hunting practices reflect bat distribution. These indices and their underlying assumptions are described in the electronic supplementary material.",

By 1980, the SPP on the property had reached (a) Epidemiological data from the entire outbreak region, (b) the index farm and (c) evidence of agricultural intensification. (a) Symptomatic Nipah virus cases in Malaysia and Singapore, January 1997-April 1999; data are from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports [7,8], records from the Department of Veterinary Services and the Ministry of Health, Malaysia [16]. Further information on case numbers can be found in the electronic supplementary material. (b) Detection of Nipah virus-induced pre-weaning mortality in the three breeding sections on the index farm. To investigate the timing of Nipah-induced mortality in the three breeding sections, we define a piglet mortality index (PMI) that compares the observed mortality for each litter with expected mortality (based on the number of piglets born and the time from farrow to wean). Here we present average PMI values through time, shown as quantiles of the values observed during the parametrization period; raw litter-level PMI values are shown in the electronic supplementary material. The presence of Nipah virus is suggested when pre-weaning mortality of piglets is significantly greater than expected, and we infer the presence of Nipah virus when significant excess mortality is observed in multiple litters during the same time period or coincident with human cases. The binned PMI values show that significant mortality peaks occurred in the Breeding Nucleus and Breeding section 2 during the time period of the first cluster of human cases in early 1997; individual litters in Breeding section 1 also showed elevated mortality during this time period (electronic supplementary material). Piglet mortality then returned to baseline levels until approximately July 1997, corresponding to the time of the next observed human cases, around which time the virus is likely to have been reintroduced from the flying fox reservoir. Model output analysed in the same manner as the piglet mortality data from the index farm is shown in the electronic supplementary material. (i) Breeding Nucleus; (ii) Breeding section 1; (iii) Breeding section 2. (c) Commercial production of mangoes and domestic pigs in Malaysia, 1961-2005. The drop in both mango (dashed lines) and pig production (solid line) between 1998 and 1999 is because of the depopulation and closing of pig farms in areas infected with Nipah virus. Mangoes on these farms were not harvested and many of the orchards have since been abandoned or converted to other crops. Data are from the Food and Agricultural Organization's Agricultural Production database.",

            "text": "Deterministic model results illustrating Nipah virus dynamics in the growing section of the index farm. Individuals are characterized as belonging to one of five states: susceptible (S), immune-maternal antibodies (A), immune-recovered from infection (R), exposed (E) and infectious (I). The top panels illustrate the infection/immunity profile of the growing section following (a) initial introduction of the virus and (b) subsequent introduction. The population profile is normalized by the capacity of the growing section (see the electronic supplementary material). The qualitative difference in infection dynamics results primarily from the prevalence of maternal antibodies in the young pig population. (c,d ) Following the initial introduction of the virus (c), the rate of replenishment of the susceptible population in the growing section (solid blue line) declines, as many individuals are immune, having been infected while in the breeding sections. The rate at which individuals are infected (green line) declines in consequence. When the virus is reintroduced (d), many individuals entering the growing section have maternal antibodies. Loss of maternal antibodies after entry into the growing section provides a source of susceptibles independent of the presence of infection (blue line), allowing the virus to persist. Infection dynamics are qualitatively similar for a wide range of transmission parameters. The results shown were produced using the following combination of transmission parameters: 1 \u00bc 0.5, s \u00bc 0.01 and R 0 \u00bc 10.

Simulations show that most epidemics produced by initial introduction of the virus drive themselves to extinction by depleting the susceptible population (blue line); however, a single reintroduction of the virus is most often sufficient to produce a subsequent epizootic that leads to persistent circulation. Here, we define persistence as circulation of the virus from the time of introduction (or reintroduction) until the farm was depopulated. Analogous results for a wide range of values for the unknown transmission parameters are shown in the electronic supplementary material. the distribution of flying fox populations in peninsular Malaysia (figure 4).
