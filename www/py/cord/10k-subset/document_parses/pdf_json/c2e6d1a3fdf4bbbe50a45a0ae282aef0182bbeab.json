Therefore, the CDC recommended using a new definition for ventilator-associated events (VAE), including infectious and other conditions. This definition includes only objective criteria and is perfectly reproducible [4] . However, recent studies and meta-analysis reported poor agreement between VAE, including ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), or probable VAP (pVAP) [5] [6] [7] . Few studies evaluated the agreement between VAE and VA-LRTI, including VAP and VAT. Although VAP and VAT are both associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, only VAP is associated with increased mortality rates [8] . Thus, it is probably important to distinguish VAP from VAT. In addition, the recent ATS/IDSA guidelines on VAP recommended not treating VAT patients with antimicrobial, based on the low quality of the available evidence [9] . Therefore, we conducted this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data to determine the agreement between VAE and VA-LRTI, including VAP and VAT. We also aimed to determine the impact of VAE on outcomes, including duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality.",

VAE and VA-LRTI are all associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital and ICU stay. VA-LRTI and VAE were not independently associated with mortality. The strengths of our study include the large number of included patients (n = 1059) and ventilator days (n = 15,029), and the prospective evaluation of all VA-LRTI, including VAT. Previous studies reported similar findings regarding the correlation between VAE and VAP [6, 11, 12] . However, few studies prospectively evaluated the incidence of VAT in patients with VAE [11, 13] . Among the 262 diagnosed episodes of VAE, only 6 (2%) were possibly related to VAT. Thus, the correlation between VAE, and VAT could not be calculated. In a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, Bouadma et al. [11] identified aetiologies of each episode and found only 1% of VAC caused by tracheobronchitis. Worsening of ventilatory parameters is not a mandatory criterion for VA-LRTI definition, and only the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) includes the alteration of the PaO 2 /FiO 2 . Our study and previous studies [5, 11] reported that an important percentage of VAE episodes were possibly related to VAP, and not to VAT. This clearly suggests that using alteration of oxygenation, i.e. PaO 2 /FiO 2 , could be helpful in differentiating VAP from VAT. Differentiating these two infections could be a difficult task, as the accuracy of chest X-ray in diagnosing new infiltrates is low [14] [15] [16] .",

VAE diagnosis algorithm is based on objective criteria and easy to use in routine in mechanically ventilated patients. However, the clinical relevance of VAE is not clear. First, our study and previous ones clearly showed that applying a VAE algorithm surveillance is not accurate in detecting VA-LRTI. Second, the impact of a ventilator bundle on VAE incidence is unknown. Few studies have focused on the preventability of VAE, but it seems [20] [21] [22] . Our results show that many VAE were non-infectious events as atelectasis, pleural effusion or acute pulmonary embolism. This might explain why ventilator bundles are not effective in preventing VAE, and should not be used to assess the quality of care in mechanically ventilated patients. VAE algorithm failed in identifying most of VAT and 73% of VAP episodes and should not be used to start an empirical treatment of VA-LRTI. Furthermore, the retrospective nature of VAE does not allow its use at bedside. In fact, to meet IVAC criteria, patients must have 2 days of stable oxygenation parameter and 2 days of worsening ventilatory settings after which a new antibiotic must be prescribed for at least 4 days.",
