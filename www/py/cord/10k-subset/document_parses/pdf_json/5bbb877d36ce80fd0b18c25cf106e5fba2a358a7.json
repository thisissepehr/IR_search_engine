            "text": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have received attention as a treatment option for a variety of infections, including influenza. The efficacy of mAbs for influenza is mediated through several mechanisms, including neutralization of virus infectivity by binding to the viral hemagglutinin (HA) interfering with receptor binding and fusion, effector functions via the antibody Fc fragment, and possible stimulation of an endogenous immune response [5] . The HA is a trimeric protein with a globular head atop a stem [6] . The globular head is immunodominant, and binds to sialic acid receptors on host cells. The HA head accumulates amino acid mutations that allow the virus to escape neutralization by antibody induced by prior infection or immunization [7, 8] . In contrast, the HA stem is highly conserved and contains the fusion machinery of the molecule [6] . Epitopes on the HA stem induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, representing potential treatment options for influenza infections [8] . There are 18 distinct HA subtypes among IAVs that fall into 2 phylogenetic groups (I and II) [8, 9] . A recently characterized human IgG1 stem binding antibody, MEDI8852, has been shown to neutralize a broad range of group I and II IAVs in vitro, and was effective for treatment of seasonal influenza in a murine model [10] . The initial characterization of MEDI8852 focused primarily on therapeutic in vivo studies and did not fully evaluate its ability to prevent and treat infection with pandemic IAV.",

Female ferrets 24 weeks of age or older (Triple F Farms, Sayre, Pennsylvania) were screened by HAI assay to ensure that they were seronegative to circulating human H3N2, H1N1, and B influenza viruses. The transmission study was conducted as previously described [13] . Ferrets were challenged intranasally with 10 6 TCID 50 influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) in a volume of 1 mL and placed in transmission cages. Naive ferrets were given MEDI8852 or R347 at 25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection on study day 0 and placed adjacent to experimentally infected ferrets in transmission cages on study day 1. Due to the rapid clearance of human antibodies in ferrets (t 1/2 of approximately 2 days; unpublished observation) [14] , RCs and experimentally infected ferrets were separated into microisolator cages on study day 3. Nasal washes were performed every other day for the duration of the study and viral titers were determined. To collect nasal washes, 1 mL of saline was instilled into the nostrils of anesthetized ferrets using a feeding tube and a sneeze response was elicited by stimulation of the nostrils. Expelled secretions were collected on petri dishes and stored in cryovials at -80\u00b0C. Great care was taken during husbandry and nasal wash collections to ensure that direct contact did not occur between the ferrets. Terminal bleeds were performed on study day 14 and serology was performed by HAI and MN assays as previously described [13] .",

We used this virus because it transmits efficiently by the airborne route while H5N1 and H7N9 viruses fail to do so or transmit less efficiently [13, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Ferrets were infected with 10 6 TCID 50 influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) intranasally. Respiratory contact ferrets received MEDI8852 (n = 4) or R347 (n = 4) at 25 mg/kg and were placed in a cage adjacent to an experimentally infected ferret ( Figure 3A ). An RC ferret was considered infected if virus was detected in nasal wash or it seroconverted. Experimentally infected ferrets shed virus for 5-11 days, with a peak on day 3 postinfection (Figure 3B and 3C). There was no difference in the timing, duration, or level of viral shedding between the 2 groups of experimentally infected ferrets. Interestingly, all RC ferrets that received R347 shed virus, while 75% of the RC ferrets that received MEDI8852 were protected from infection ( Figure 3B and 3C). RC ferrets shed virus from day 1 to day 11 postexposure with maximal shedding on days 3-5. H1N1pdm09-specific HAI antibody was detected in all ferrets that shed virus (Table 1 ). These data demonstrate that administration of MEDI8852 to naive contact ferrets can protect them from airborne transmission of the H1N1pdm09 virus.",

All ferrets that received oseltamivir alone or R347 died. Ferrets that received MEDI8852 at 25, 12.5, or 6.25 mg/kg had survival rates of 57%, 86%, and 29%, respectively. Ferrets that received a combination of oseltamivir and MEDI8852 at any dose had a survival rate of 86% and less weight loss than the other groups. Overall, MEDI8852 provided equal or superior protection to oseltamivir when used to treat H7N9 and H5N1 infections in ferrets. Remarkably, combination therapy administered late in infection provided greater protection, supporting a potential role for MEDI8852 as an adjunct to oseltamivir treatment.",

            "text": "MEDI8852 is a novel HA stem mAb that has previously been demonstrated to have broad neutralizing capacity against wildtype seasonal and cold-adapted pandemic influenza viruses [10] . It was effective for treatment of seasonal influenza virus infection in mice and is currently under clinical investigation in healthy adults with uncomplicated seasonal influenza. In this study, we extended the characterization of MEDI8852 against group I and group II pandemic influenza strains. We confirmed that MEDI8852 neutralized a broad range of wild-type IAV with pandemic potential in vitro, including several highly pathogenic H5 viruses that were isolated from wild birds in North America. We demonstrated, in mouse and ferret models, that MEDI8852 is an effective treatment agent against influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) alone and in combination with oseltamivir. We also showed that MEDI8852 is effective for prophylaxis against H5N1 and H7N9 infection in mice and prevented transmission of H1N1pdm09 in ferrets. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are recommended for treatment of sporadic infections with novel IAVs, including H5N1 and H7N9 [19] . However, the utility of these agents for nonseasonal influenza is not well defined. A retrospective review of observational data comparing the use of oseltamivir to no antiviral treatment in H5N1 infections showed a survival benefit in patients treated with oseltamivir (60% survival in oseltamivir-treated patients vs 24% survival in untreated patients) [20] . However, the case-fatality rate for oseltamivir-treated H5N1infected patients was still high at 40%, with a significant decline in survival noted when treatment was initiated \u22652 days after symptom onset. Observational data also reveal high case-fatality rates in patients with H7N9 infection despite treatment with NAI [21] . Resistance to NAIs has also been documented in H5N1 and H7N9 viruses [19] . Our data suggest that MEDI8852 could be used as a treatment agent either alone or in combination with a NAI in the event of an influenza pandemic. We demonstrated a dose and time-dependent therapeutic effect when MEDI8852 was used to treat H5N1 and H7N9 infection in both mice and ferrets. In ferrets, we showed that MEDI8852 augments the effects of oseltamivir when treatment is initiated late in the course of infection. This is particularly important Dashed lines signify 0% (starting weight) and -25% (weight below which euthanasia is performed) weight loss. *P < .05, **P < .005, ***P < .005 when treatment was compared to R347 treatment by log-rank (Mantel-Cox because most patients with documented H5N1 and H7N9 infection receive oseltamivir after 72 hours of symptoms, when oseltamivir is likely to have less impact on the course of infection [22, 23] . The combination of MEDI8852 and oseltamivir in clinical practice may improve survival in patients who present to care later in the course of their illnesses.",

These antibodies demonstrated neutralizing activity in vitro against a range of IAVs, with variable therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Additionally, it has been difficult to isolate antibodies targeting a broad range of group II HAs. In the event of an influenza pandemic, it would be advantageous to be able to treat an infected patient without prior knowledge of the infecting subtype. MEDI8852 binds a unique epitope in a very similar orientation with both group I and group II HAs and could potentially be used to treat either subtype [10] .",
