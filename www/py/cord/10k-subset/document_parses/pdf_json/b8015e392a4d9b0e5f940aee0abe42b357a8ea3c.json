The first stage involves administering broadspectrum antibiotics to avoid inappropriate treatment in patients with true bacterial pneumonia. The second stage involves de-escalating an initially appropriate antibiotic regimen to avoid overuse of antibiotics, by streamlining, shortening or stopping therapy, as dictated by the patient's clinical response and information about the bacteriology of the infection. Although de-escalation therapy is suggested to be part of any appropriate antimicrobial stewardship in patients with VAP [3] , controversy continues regarding the outcomes associated with its implementation. Indeed, some reports suggest that de-escalation therapy does not affect mortality and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay [4, 5] , whereas others claim that it does significantly improve them [6, 7] . Moreover, there are suggestions that de-escalation therapy improves mortality at 2 weeks after VAP onset, but does not significantly affect either mortality at 1 month or the duration of ICU and hospital stay [8] . However, the potential effect of de-escalation therapy on outcomes, that are based on clinical diagnosis of VAP, may be difficult to assess, as clinical diagnosis is frequently associated with risk for overestimation of the incidence of infection [9, 10] . Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess outcomes in association with the implementation of de-escalation therapy in a well-defined group of patients [11] who had developed VAP as confirmed by two separate cultures, one quantitative tracheal aspirate and one bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample, that both had to be positive.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 116, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 121, "end": 124, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 659, "end": 662, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 888, "end": 891, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 892, "end": 894, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 958, "end": 961, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 962, "end": 964, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1432, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1436, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1605, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study was conducted during a 24-month period at the University of Thrace teaching hospital (500 beds), Greece.

The empiric antibiotic regimen was guided by the Gram stain, the presence of risk factors for multiresistant pathogens and the local microbiology data [15] . Antibiotics were ranked according to activity spectrum against Gram-negative bacteria (highest 4, lowest 1) as follows [6, 13] : carbapenems 4; extended spectrum penicillins 3, quinolone and aminoglycoside 2, and beta-lactams 1 [16] . This rank of activity spectrum was used to de-escalate therapy to the narrowest spectrum agent available. In the absence of P. aeruginosa, carbapenem was de-escalated to extendedspectrum penicillin, or to quinolone, or if possible to a non-antipseudomonal beta-lactam, and extendedspectrum penicillin was de-escalated to quinolone or if possible to a non-antipseudomonal beta-lactam.

Thus, the results of this study cannot necessarily be extended to other populations. Another limitation is that investigators were aware of the patients' assignment and of their de-escalation therapy status. However, obstacles in blinding were posed by the necessity to collect both samples in all study patients and to modify treatment in the context of de-escalation therapy. Nevertheless, our efforts were focused on standardizing care and using rigorous criteria to evaluate outcomes. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that our study was not specifically designed to test the hypothesis that de-escalation therapy is superior to a non-de-escalation regimen in terms of improving clinical outcomes.
