Public sector schemes have buffer funds that aim to smooth contribution rates. As an outcome, about a third of the accrued earnings-related pension rights are pre-funded.",

            "text": "The main challenge of the pension system is population ageing, which is escalating in Finland due to the recent large fall in fertility. If the number of children remains low and net migration does not increase markedly, there will be a growing need to increase contribution rates. Moreover, the life expectancy adjustment of pensions lowers replacement rates if mortality rates fall as expected. It will be compensated partly by longer working careers, but full compensation would require a faster-than-projected increase in employment rates. Other risks that may infl uence the sustainability of the pension system include lower growth in employment and wages due to technological development as well as lower pension fund yields than expected. This review fi rst provides a brief outlook on the various development stages of the Finnish pension system that are still visible in its basic structure and the logic of the current version. The subsequent section illustrates with some key indicators how the current system has succeeded in reaching its goals and shows its risk-sharing properties. This is followed by a discussion of how the pension system is prepared to cope with future challenges that are common to pension schemes across industrialised countries. The concluding section suggests changes that could make the Finnish system even more resilient.",

The balance between reaching the ambitious redistribution goals and minimising labour supply distortions is achieved with tax-fi nanced, income tested basic pensions, income-tested basic pensions and a strong link between wage income and accrued pensions for middle-and high-income workers in the earnings-related schemes.

Key elements were the harmonisation of the benefi t rules of different earnings-related schemes, a tighter link between earned income and accruals, introduction of fl exible old age retirement, gradual abolishment of several early retirement schemes and the introduction of a link between life expectancy of the retiring cohort and the pensions. Pension accrual starts from an earlier age and smaller amounts of wages are counted. A pensionable wage is determined by the whole working career. Pensions are fully portable allowing job and sector changes without losses in accrued amounts. The maximum replacement rate was abolished. The accrued pension rights are indexed to average wages and consumer prices with weights 80/20 during working years. For the pensions in payment, the ratio is 20/80.

As population projections are important for the sustainability of pay-as-you-go fi nanced defi ned benefi t pensions, it is useful to assess the uncertainty involved. Analysis performed using the stochastic population projections as inputs in an economic model shows that the Finnish idea of linking both pensions and the retirement age to life expectancy can manage longevity uncertainty very well. Longer working life helps to mitigate the replacement rate decline at the same time as the fi nancial sustainability of both the pension system and the general government is improved (Lassila and Valkonen, 2018) .",

We observe the outcome of the interaction of current pension rules and realised demographic and economic risks but know little about the alternatives. One way of investigating risk sharing is to use stochastic simulations, which describe the outcomes of the current and alternative rules in hundreds of demographic and economic futures. This method provides a set of choices for policymakers. If the pension system is reformed when required instead of investing in risk sharing rules, the system would benefi t from a practice that triggers automatic adjustments to benefi ts and contributions until a reformed scheme takes effect. Such a rule would speed up the adjustments processes. tion schemes, the low yield means that the adequacy of pensions is at risk. In pre-funded defi ned benefi t schemes, the contributions are increased either immediately due to solvency issues, or later when the funds are used to pay pensions. The Finnish private sector pension institutes have a unique solvency rule that allows a decline in the pre-funded share of the accrued pension liability when stock market prices fall. It has been suggested that this share should be enlarged to allow a riskier investment policy as a response to the low interest rates. This would improve the average return on the funds and mitigate potential problems because of solvency requirements (such as the forced sale of risky assets during recessions), but it increases the variation in the contribution rate, when the funds are used to pay pensions.",
