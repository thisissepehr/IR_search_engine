Here we introduce and study an adaptive susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model wherein the infection and network coevolve with nontrivial probability to close triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network transitivity. This model provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using numerical simulations and approximate master equations (AMEs), we identify and examine a rich set of dynamical features in the model. In many cases, AMEs including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions. Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AMEs accurately trace the temporal evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population, when closing a triangle is the dominant rewiring mechanism. These methods and results may be useful in developing ideas and modeling strategies for controlling SIS-type epidemics.",

            "text": "In recent years, the study of dynamical processes on complex networks has received significant attention in the mathematical modeling of epidemics [1, 2] . There exist three distinct approaches to modeling epidemic spread as a dynamical process on networks. In the first, each node is allowed to change its state with no evolution of the underlying network structure through time, while in the second the network structure coevolves with the state of the nodes [3, 4] . A third and more complex approach involves combining the inherent (disease-independent) evolution of social networks with the epidemic dynamics [5] [6] [7] [8] . The second approach is more realistic for modeling epidemic spread in cases where the state of being infected influences the presence of contact over which the infection can spread. Pragmatically, the details of the network evolution incorporate potentially several social processes. It is a common observation that healthy individuals avoid contact with individuals suffering from an infectious disease. A recent study shows that humans can identify sick individuals through olfactory-visual cues; furthermore, the human immune system appears to use these cues to motivate healthy individuals to avoid contact with infective individuals [9] , reducing the risk of contagions and increasing the biological fitness. Another mechanism that leads to the severing of ties between healthy and infective individuals is the practice of quarantine, often enforced by public health agencies to stop the spread of communicable diseases. Such a preference in attachment between individuals changes the social network and thus influences the spread of the infection. Studying this interplay between the infection spread and the coevolving network structure has the potential to provide insights into the processes of disease spread.",

For instance, Ref. [16] shows that clustering in networks could raise the epidemic threshold and degree correlations can alter the epidemic size. However, results obtained using static network models ignore effects due to the underlying social networks evolving in response to the spread of a disease. Coevolutionary network systems, also called adaptive networks, model the dynamics of node states (e.g., susceptible vs infected) together with rules for rewiring network edges in response to the observed states, providing a more general setting to model disease dynamics. Numerous studies have explored different aspects of the interplay between coevolving networks and epidemic spread [19, 20] , including extensions to signed networks [21] ; nevertheless, a variety of open problems and challenges still exist despite increased understanding of coevolving systems [22] [23] [24] .",

            "text": "In this paper we introduce an adaptive susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) model on a coevolving network which incorporates a rewiring rule that reinforces transitivity similar to that employed in [26, 27] . The most straightforward strategy to deal with an infectious disease is to sever all the links between susceptible and infected individuals. However, humans are social animals and need a certain amount of social relationships to function. Therefore, only discarding the infectedsusceptible links without compensation is not pragmatic in all settings. Under the mechanism considered here, susceptible individuals break links to their infected neighbors, rewiring those links to either a random individual in the network or a neighbor's neighbor. The latter rewiring will lead to reinforcement of transitivity (increased clustering coefficient) in the system. While transitivity is a critical property of social networks, studies of epidemic dynamics on coevolving networks have mostly neglected this property. Our model thus provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in epidemic dynamics in coevolving network systems. This rewiring rule includes a parameter that governs the preferential rewiring to close triangles. We study the impact of this transitivity reinforcement on the spread of the infection and on the details of the network using numerical simulations of the process as well as an approximate master equation framework (see [28, 29] ). In Sec. II we describe our model and in Sec. III we present results obtained through numerical simulations, highlighting the dynamical features observed in the model. In Sec. IV we present a derivation of our semianalytical method, confirming results obtained from numerical simulations. Sections III and IV also include identification and analysis of bifurcations in the system dynamics. We conclude in Sec. V with further discussion.",

Under the latter situation, uniform rewiring, there remains nonzero probability of randomly picking a neighbor of a neighbor, but this probability becomes vanishingly small for larger networks. In the event that there is no available susceptible node to rewire to (e.g., there are no distance-2 susceptible nodes), the rewiring attempt fails and the original link to the infected neighbor remains.

            "text": "To highlight the main differences between our model and previous work without reinforced transitivity [34] , we first confirm that our model leads to nontrivial transitivity. We explore two closely related measures of transitivity here. The first measure is the average local clustering coefficient C = (triangles) and the total number of triplets centered at vertex i, respectively [35] . The second measure is the transitivity T (often called global clustering coefficient) [36] , defined as T = 3T /\u03c4 , where T and \u03c4 are, respectively, the total number of closed triangles and the number of triplets in the network. Figures 1(a) and 1(c) show the temporal evolution of the average local clustering coefficient C and the transitivity T in our model, with varying \u03b7 from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.2, keeping all other parameters fixed and choosing the initial degree distribution to be Poisson. When \u03b7 = 0, there is no reinforcement of transitivity, i.e., C \u2248 0 (T \u2248 0) for all time and we are in the same regime studied in Ref. [34] . For nonzero \u03b7, the clustering coefficients rapidly increase and then slowly converge to nonzero values, except in the case \u03b7 = 1, where we do not observe this convergence, and C (as well as T ) appears to continue to grow with a diminishing rate. We treat \u03b7 = 1 as a special case in our model and will study this case separately later. We also explored the influence of initial degree distributions on the final clustering coefficient. In Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) we observe that networks with the regular degree distribution initially achieve higher clustering coefficients compared to networks with the other two initial distributions. Moreover, networks with initial Poisson and truncated power law degree distributions show indistinguishable final clustering coefficients for \u03b7 < 1. Finally, in Fig. 2 we examine the local clustering coefficient C grouped by susceptible nodes S and infected nodes I at time t = 5000 for networks with Poisson degree distributions initially and with different values of \u03b7. As \u03b7 increases, susceptible nodes typically achieve higher values of local clustering coefficient C compared to the infected nodes. Given that our model demonstrates nontrivial transitivity, we now explore how the reinforced transitivity influences the evolution of disease prevalence I. In Fig. 3 we plot the observed disease prevalence at long times in the (\u03b3 , \u03b7) parameter space, fixing the infection rate \u03b2 = 0.04 and recovery rate \u03b1 = 0.005 as in Ref. [34] . The phase diagram in Fig. 3 indicates that for large enough \u03b3 the system eventually becomes disease-free, presumably because susceptible nodes can easily rid themselves of infected neighbors by rewiring these edges, thus effectively quarantining the infection. When \u03b3 = 0, there is no rewiring process, the network does not change, and hence \u03b7 has no effect. A more interesting behavior occurs for \u03b3 0.05, with large values of disease prevalence that depend FIG. 3 . Phase diagrams in parameter space (\u03b3 , \u03b7) for the observed disease prevalence I at time t = 10 000 on networks with initial degree distributions that are (a) Poisson, (b) truncated power law, and (c) degree regular. We set here \u03b2 = 0.04, \u03b1 = 0.005, and = 0.1. At the selected time t = 10 000 all cases except \u03b7 = 1 appear to have converged to their stationary states. Results are averaged over 30 simulations at each set of parameters. These diagrams are generated through bilinear interpolation from results on a regular grid, leading to some apparent grid artifacts. on \u03b7 in a complex manner. Since this parameter regime is most interesting for our present study, in the rest of our simulations we fix \u03b3 = 0.04 and vary \u03b7 to investigate the influence of transitivity reinforcement.",

The moment-closure frameworks of pair approximation (PA) and approximate master equations (AMEs) have both been used effectively in similar settings [1, 28, 37] . In PA, the different counts of contact pairs are used to approximate the density of triplets, thus closing the system of equations [28] . In contrast, the AME framework considers the populations of nodes according to their state, degree, and the states of FIG. 5 . Bifurcation diagrams of the disease prevalence in the stationary state I \u221e versus \u03b2 at different values of \u03b7. Each row of plots corresponds to a specific degree distribution: The first row is Poisson, the second row is truncated power law, and the third row is degree regular. Each column of plots corresponds to a particular value of \u03b7, as indicated at the top of the column. Every point represents a mean of 30 realizations of the system at t = 10 000. The last column belongs to the \u03b7 = 1 case, noting that the y axis is labeled I (cf. I \u221e ) because the simulations have not reached stationarity. The other parameters of the system are \u03b3 = 0.02 and \u03b1 = 0.005. (We also study the effect of different in initially Poisson networks; see the Appendix A 2.) their immediate neighbors, approximating other quantities from these populations. The AME is an annealed mean field approximation that deterministically approximates stochastic systems. We note in particular that with the additional variables and corresponding differential equations in AMEs, the triplet counts are precisely accounted for (cf. the closure approximations necessary to obtain triplet counts in PA) and that the AME typically provides a more accurate approximation of such dynamics and can be highly stable around the critical point of the dynamics [1, 28, 34, 37, 38] (see also [28, 37, 39] for comparisons between the AME and PA). We note that Ref. [38] further extended this approach to classify links according to the states, numbers of neighbors, and numbers of infected neighbors at both ends of the links. This link-based approach can further improve on the accuracy of the AME method; however, it increases the system size from O(k 2 max ) to O(k 4 max ) equations, where k max is the maximum degree. As such, we restrict our attention here to the AME method.",

To better understand the derivation of this line, we note that only S nodes can rewire and be rewired to in this model (whereas I neighbors are only dropped by the action of S nodes). Supposing the center node is of class S (k\u22121)l , then it has l k\u22121 proportion of its neighbors infected neighbors, and we describe the number of SI edges among them as (1 \u2212 \u03b7) , is the effect of a center class with state S rewired to a random node in the network with state S. For the I kl compartment in Eq. (5), the center class can only lose edges due to rewiring and the value of \u03b7 does not change the rate at which edges to I nodes are rewired.

Second, for small \u03b7, AME approximates the temporal evolution of the disease prevalence with a high level of accuracy, even in the initial transient states, and correctly predicts the direction of the changes with \u03b7. However, the differences between simulations and the AME increase at larger \u03b7 and are particularly obvious for the truncated power law case, but the AME still captures the overall shape of the temporal evolution of disease prevalence. (To further highlight these elements, in Fig. 21 in the Appendix A 3, we provide a zoomed-in view for the transient dynamics t \u2208 [0, 1000] for some of the panels of Fig. 8.) To study the above results in greater detail, we allow \u03b7 to vary from 0 to 1 while keeping all other parameters fixed and focusing on the initial Poisson degree distribution. We compare simulation and AME results in Fig. 8 , illustrating one of the critical features of our model: the disease prevalence decreases with increasing \u03b7. That is, we observe that systems with a stronger preference for transitivity have smaller numbers of infected individuals, all else being equal. The thick lines in Fig. 8(a) for the AME results accurately capture the final disease prevalence and roughly describe its temporal evolution for \u03b7 < 0.8. For 0.8 \u03b7 1, the AME underestimates the stationary disease prevalence I but still captures qualitative features of the evolution. Remarking again that \u03b7 = 1 is a special case, we note that the system does not reach a well-defined stationary state in our simulations, with I continuing to decrease. In Fig. 9 we further explore the temporal evolution of I when \u03b7 = 1 while varying k from 2 to 10. We identify a slow power law decay in I for k = 2; using the curve fitting in MATLAB \u00ae , we find that the disease prevalence I for \u03b7 = 1 and k = 2 scales as I = 1.9t \u22120.173 (also shown in Fig. 9 ), with I appearing to slowly approach a disease-free state. As the mean degree increases, the observed decay with t becomes even slower, to the point that we cannot claim anything about the functional form of the long-time decay from the figure; nevertheless, we provide power law fits to the late times in the figure for comparison. Although the AME prediction for the temporal evolution for \u03b7 = 1 is qualitatively very different, it does appear to predict a correct I \u221e = 0 disease-free stationary state (see Fig. 8 ).",

Indeed, for both the initial Poisson and truncated power law cases, the stationary degree distribution appears to be close to Poisson with mean degree k = 2 [see the thick gray line in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) ]. This observation implies that the stationary states resulting from this process have both a Poisson degree distribution and nonzero transitivity. We recall that the model includes two kinds of rewiring: at random to any susceptible node and to a distance-2 neighbor. Neither of these has direct preference to rewire to vertices with a particular degree, except that rewiring to a distance-2 neighbor cannot rewire to a singleton. That is, both rewiring mechanisms are essentially similar to random rewiring in ignoring node degree, which leads to a Poisson degree distribution. Hence, we expect the initial degree distributions to converge to Poisson-like distributions in stationary. Similar to Fig. 5 in Ref. [34] , we plot (Fig. 13 ) bifurcation diagrams of stationary disease prevalence level I \u221e versus infection rate \u03b2 with an initial Poisson degree distribution and with different mean degrees k = 2, 4, and 8. The other parameters here include \u03b3 = 0.02 and \u03b1 = 0.005. We obtained the average stationary disease prevalence level I \u221e at each value of \u03b2 from 30 Monte Carlo simulations for each initial infected proportion = 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.99, and 0.999. We call attention to the range of the infection rate \u03b2 plotted in Fig. 13 , ranging from 0 to 0.04 in Figs. 13(a)-13(d) for k = 2, from 0 to 0.02 in Figs. 13(e)-13(h) for k = 4, and from 0 to 0.008 in Figs. 13(i)-13(l) for k = 8.

Fixing the average degree, the final disease prevalence level appears to be almost constant across network sizes. Nevertheless, we note that the \u03b2 values considered in Fig. 15 are clearly above the transition between disease-free and endemic cases, though the \u03b2 used with k = 4 in Fig. 15(b) is much closer to the transition than that in Fig. 15(a) . Combined with Fig. 14, where the susceptibility \u03c7 and phase transition seem to not depend on the network size, these findings suggest that, in general, the stationary disease prevalence level I \u221e does not change appreciably with the size of the system here. While we acknowledge that the precise details in and immediately around the transition in \u03b2 might be expected to be more sensitive to system size, such an exploration would involve an even more intensive numerical investigation simultaneously considering variations in N, \u03b2, and \u03b7.

We showed that for \u03b7 < 0.8, our AME system predicts the disease prevalence in the stationary state. Furthermore, we illustrated the accuracies of the stationary degree distributions predicted by the AME. This success of the AME further supports its use to study a variety of binary state dynamics on coevolving networks, accurately predicting properties of large networks at a manageable computational cost. We remark that the high AME accuracy observed here for nonzero \u03b7 may be surprising, in that a key assumption of the AME method is that the networks are locally treelike, but this assumption will seemingly become less valid as local clustering increases with increasing \u03b7. Nevertheless, our AME method appears able to provide good predictions; the possible reasons for such accuracy remain a potential area for future exploration. (See, e.g., Ref. [41] for other settings where theoretical models remain good predictions in the presence of significant local clustering.)",

When \u03b7 = 1, the system evolves very slowly and does not converge to a stationary state in our simulated times, with the disease prevalence appearing to decay as a small inverse power of t. We surmise that the system is slowly approaching a diseasefree state. In this case, the AME is not able to quantitatively describe the temporal evolution of the system; however, it appears to still correctly predict the final disease-free state. Different cutoff degrees in the truncated power law distribution have different levels of disease prevalence temporarily; however, as t increases, they lead to the same level of disease prevalence.",

On the other hand, the differences between simulations at different \u03b7 are not particularly large for \u03b7 up to around 0.6 and with qualitative differences only for \u03b7 = 1 (see Figs. 8 and 10). The changes in the stationary levels predicted by the AME do not vary greatly with \u03b7 either, but they appear to do so in the correct direction for these quantities here. While the AME does not capture the system dynamics well when \u03b7 is large, it nevertheless provides good predictions for the stationary disease prevalence (Figs. 10, 13, and 17) and degree distributions (Figs. 11 and 12) for \u03b7 not too close to 1.",
