            "text": "In vitro alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was measured in adults of species belonging to Drosophila and to the related genus Zaprionus. Data were analyzed according to the known breeding sites and the level of ethanol tolerance of these species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was assayed with both ethanol (E) and isopropanol (I). Our results show a very broad range of activities among the 71 species investigated, the ratio of the highest value observed (D. melanogaster) to the lowest (D. pruinosa) being 65: 1. A general positive correlation was found between the level of ADH activity and the capacity to detoxify ethanol. Nevertheless, many species show exceptions to this rule. Contrary to a logical expectation, adaptation to high alcoholic resources, which has been a recurrent evolutionary event, was not mediated by a more efficient use ofethanol, that is, an increase ofthe Ell ratio. This ratio seems to be quite variable according to the phylogeny and is especially low in the subgenus Sophophora as well as in Zaprionus. Alcohol tolerance clearly is related to the larval habitat of the species and shows that adaptation to alcoholic resources has been a major evolutionary challenge in drosophilids. This adaptation is not related to phylogeny, having occurred independently several times during the evolution of the group. Finally, it should be borne in mind that, besides metabolization and detoxification, other physiological processes such as nervous-system tolerance or ethanol excretion may be involved in ethanol tolerance, and such functions also should be investigated. Environmental ethanol, which is certainly a major ecological parameter for many drosophilids, has selected a diversity of physiological adaptations, all related to the Adh locus, but presumably much more complicated than was previously believed.",

The amount of alcohol found in fermenting fruits remains generally low, less than 4% (Gibson et al. 1981; McKechnie and Morgan 1982; Oakeshott et al. 1982; Capy et al. 1988 ). However, in some manmade environments, resources resulting from artificial fermentations may contain more than 10% alcohol (Briscoe et al. 1975; McKenzie and McKechnie 1979) . Drosophila melanogaster is well known for its capacity to proliferate in wine cellars during vintage time and shows much geographic variability with respect to alcohol tolerance (David et al. 1986) . Two other species are also known to exhibit a high alcohol tolerance and breed under artificial fermentation conditions: these are D. virilis, found in breweries (David and Kitagawa 1982) and D. lebanonensis, the most tolerant species, which is found in Spanish wine cellars .",

Three or four samples of 30 males (6-8 d old), obtained from uncrowded cultures at 25\u00b0C, were weighed and homogenized in 0.1 M tris HC1 buffer, pH 8.6 (l mL of buffer for 30 mg of fresh weight). After centrifugation, the supernatant was taken and kept at -70\u00b0C for 1 to 9 wk before ADH activity was measured. The assay mixture was composed of 0.8 mL of supernatant, 0.1 mL of 10% alcoholic substrate, 90% of 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer, and 0.1 mL ofO.02M {jNAD. The measurements were made using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1 spectrophotometer at 25\u00b0C, for 90 s with ethanol and 30 s with isopropanol. One unit ofADH activity is defined as an increase in absorbance of 0.001 per minute at 340 nm. The ADH activity is expressed in .:laD x 10 3 per mg of fresh weight. This protocol for ADH activity assays has been established for D. melanogaster. Although it may not be optimal for all species, it appeared reliable enough to be used for the species studied here.

Larvae were grown at 25\u00b0C on a killed yeast medium (David 1962) , which minimizes crowding effects and produces healthy adult flies. After light etherization, the adults were aged on vials with the same medium. For toxicity tests, samples of 20 4-6-d-old males or females were transferred in airtight plastic vials in the presence of 2 mL of an ethanol solution of a given concentration. In all concentrations, 3% sucrose was added to prevent any mortality caused by starvation. This may be important, especially for species very sensitive to ethanol. With this technique, mortality under control conditions (without ethanol) must be null. This was verified during the aging process. In a few cases, a significant mortality was observed before the treatment. In such cases, the flies were discarded and the assay repeated in another experiment. For each assay we used three or four concentrations. For each ethanol concentration, at least four vials (80 adults) of both sexes were used. Dead flies were scored after two d oftreatment. Mortality was plotted against concentration and the LD50 estimated graphically. Toxicity studies must show a very clear correlation between concentration and mortality, that is, almost no dead flies at the lowest concentration. This was regularly verified. In all investigated species, sex differences were very small and the data were pooled before calculation of the LD50.",

However, some exceptions are found. Several species showing a low ADH activity, such as Di funebris, D. littoralis, and D. mercatorum, are fairly tolerant to ethanol. The ADH of D.funebris has a high specific activity although the enzyme protein is present at low concentrations in the flies (Atrian and Gonzalez-Duarte 1982) . A possible explanation for this is that this high specificity may improve the ethanol tolerance, thanks to a rapid metabolic flux. Alternatively, it may be that the low concentration ofenzyme prevents accurate measurement of the activity in crude extracts, even if, in this species, the enzymatic expression is optimal at the same pH (8.6) used in our assays. In contrast to the above cases, some species show a high ADH activity but a low ethanol tolerance. Such is the case for D. bipectinata, D. parabipectinata, and D. ercepeae. This last species is remarkable because it ranks second for ADH activity (5.173) but only 50th for ethanol tolerance (LD50 = 2.1%). Drosophila melanogaster is a good example of the relative independence between ADH activity and ethanol LD50. Only the geographic origin of the four strains studied is discriminant for ethanol tolerance. Thus, the two Adh sS strains have similar ADH activities (2.644 and 2.544) but their LD50 values are very different, one of them being twice that of the other (6.3 versus 13.8). The two Adh F F strains also have similar ADH activities (5.793 and 5.419) but very different LD50 values (7.3 versus 15.6). By contrast, the two dutch strains have similar LD50 be an adaptation to the presence of ethanol in the larval food sources.",

            "text": "Alcohol tolerance is clearly related to the larval habitat of the species and shows that adaptation to alcoholic resources has been a major evolutionary challenge in drosophilids. This adaptation is not related to phylogeny, having occurred independently several times during the evolutionary process and probably arises rapidly. This is best demonstrated for those species that can breed in artificial man-made fermenting resources because they belong to three different subgenera. If, however, we compare fruit-breeding and nonfruit-breeding species, a broad overlap exists between the two groups ( fig. 5 ). For example, eight fruit breeding species have tolerances less than 2 and are therefore very sensitive to ethanol. This observation may be explained in two ways. First, the amount ofalcohol in natural fruits must be likely very low in many cases, especially when the ambient temperature is low (temperate species) and the resource is small in size. Second, all the measurements of alcohol toxicity have been made on adults, because they are easier to test, whereas in nature environmental alcohol mainly affects larvae. Further investigations should be carried out on the larval tolerances, for which we have few data. In Drosophila melanogasterwe found that larval and adult tolerances were highly correlated (David et al. 1986 ) but this may not be the case for all species. However, Drosophila sugar-cornmeal medium, when seeded with live yeast, undergoes an alcoholic fermentation. The amount of ethanol that is produced is not known, but may exceed 2%. We found that all nonfruit-breeding species for which adult tolerance is less than 2% could not be grown in such conditions, that is, with live yeast. Even more interestingly, the eight fruit-breeding species that exhibit an adult tolerance of less than 2, also cannot be grown on such fermenting food: low adult tolerance is thus correlated with an obvious larval sensitivity. In nature, these species presumably survive because they use small fruits, or fruits with a low sugar content. Another observation is that larval and adult preferences are generally related, that is, their ecological niches are similar. More precisely, adults of all fruit-breeding species are attracted by fermenting baits. However most adults of the nonfruit-breeding species do not come to these All these results suggest that other factors may affect ethanol tolerance and that the ADH enzymatic activity cannot in itself explain the interspecific diversity observed for this physiological trait.",

All species exhibit significant ADH activity when compared to the ADH-null mutant ofD. melanogaster. As shown in figure 4 , a positive correlation is found between ADH activity levels and the capacity to detoxify ethanol. As pointed out in the results section, a broad range of variations is observed, Some species, such as D. funebris, D. littoralis, and D. mercatorum, are quite tolerant to ethanol but have a low ADH activity. Others, like Drosophila ercepeae, are very sensitive to alcohol, in spite of a high level of enzyme activity. Also in D. melanogaster, a well-known difference exists between the two common allozymes (Day et al. 1974; Lewis and Gibson 1978; McDonald et al. 1980; Maroni et al. 1982 ), but alcohol tolerance in this species depends almost exclusively on the geographic origin (tropical Africa versus Europe) rather than the ADH activity or Adh genotype of the strain. Other pathways for ethanol degradation are known in D. melanogaster, such as catalase and MEOS ( Van der Zel et al. 1991) . The amount of fatty acid in the food may also increase ethanol tolerance and modify the sensitivity of cell membranes to the disordering effects ofethanol. These observations show that alcohol tolerance is a complex phenotypic trait that may be influenced by several physiological functions leading to ethanol degradation, as well as by other processes, such as the sensitivity ofthe target organs (in this case the nervous system) or the capacity to excrete ethanol . Further investigations on some conveniently chosen species should lead to a better understanding of these processes.",

            "text": "Drosophila melanogaster ADH is a generalist enzyme known to act on a broad range ofnatural and artificial substrates, but is most efficient at breaking down molecules with more than two carbon atoms and secondary alcohols, like isopropanol rather than primary alcohols such as n-propanol (Winberg et al. 1982; Hovik et al. 1984; Eisses 1989) . However, the biological efficiency, measured by comparing ADH+ and ADH-flies, is maximal on ethanol (David et al. 1976 ). Moreover, isopropanol, one of the best substrates, is converted into acetone, a metabolic \"cul de sac\" for a fly, which is more toxic than the alcohol (Papel et al. 1979; David et al. 1981 ). These observations have now been extended to many other species, and in particular a higher activity is found on isopropanol than on the more abundant ethanol. Contrary to logical expectations, adaptation to high alcoholic resources, which has been a recurrent evolutionary event, is not mediated by a better use of ethanol, that is, an increase of Ell ratio. However, this ratio seems to be quite variable phylogenetically and is especially low in the subgenus Sophophora and the genus Zaprionus. Such a conclusion is not unexpected. Changing the substrate properties by natural selection would imply a modification of the active site of the enzyme, that is, a change in the amino-acid sequence of the protein, and this would require a very long evolutionary time scale. As has often been argued, short-term adaptation is more likely to occur by changing gene regulation than gene structure (McDonald et al. 1977) .",
