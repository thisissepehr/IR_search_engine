Conclusion: Children with pulmonary complications after day +28 have higher mean FeNO levels 28 days after HSCT than children without later pulmonary complications. Therefore, FeNO could be an important diagnostic tool for hyperinflammatory response in bronchial epithelium after paediatric HSCT. [9, 25, 27] . These complications are infectious or non-infectious and are classified as early or late depending on whether they occur before or after day 100 after transplantation [12] . Several risk factors for infectious complications including neutropenia and myeloablative therapy [8] have been published, while non-myeloablative conditioning regimen and graft source may predispose for non-infectious pulmonary complications such as pulmonary graft versus host disease (GvHD). Yet, reliable predisposing risk factors have not been established, partly due to insufficient understanding of the exact underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of these diseases [1, 12] . The most common early-onset non-infectious pulmonary complications include peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia (BOOP) [12, 30] . Therefore, measurement of the degree of bronchial inflammation is a potential key for early detection of HSCT-related pulmonary pathology. During inflammatory processes in the lungs, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is known to be upregulated, leading physiologically to production of nitric oxide (NO) supporting a non-specific defence against microorganisms. Furthermore, nitric oxide seems to be involved in airway and vascular calibre regulation, finally leading to bronchodilation [14] . Kanamori et al. [15] have shown that fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is elevated in adults with bronchiolitis obliterans after HSCT. We therefore hypothesised that FeNO may be a sensitive marker for early alloimmunologic pulmonary complications also in children and adolescents, but prospective data have not been published yet to support this hypothesis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1131, "end": 1134, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1138, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1142, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1316, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1420, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1795, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1799, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2035, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2039, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2538, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2557, "end": 2561, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In this first prospective study, we assessed the prevalence and underlying risk factors of pulmonary complications in paediatric patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for malignant or non-malignant diseases at St. Anna Children's Hospital between 1 October 2007 and 30 November 2009.

In a recent study with adult patients after lung transplantation, FeNO has been shown to be a valuable tool for risk stratification for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [21] . In contrast to immunocompetent children [7, 19] , no data exist on normal FeNO levels in immunosuppressed children or on the predictive value of elevated FeNO for pulmonary complications after paediatric allogeneic HSCT. FeNO levels were generally lower in our cohort than in the adult study by Kanamori or in adult patients following autologous HSCT after breast carcinoma [24] , reflecting the fact that norm values in immunocompetent children are also lower than in adults. Notably, FeNO levels did not correlate significantly with pulmonary function parameters such as FEV1, FVC or TLC.
