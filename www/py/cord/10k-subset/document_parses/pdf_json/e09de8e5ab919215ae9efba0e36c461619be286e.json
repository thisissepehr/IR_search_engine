Patients and methods: Granulocytes were collected from unrelated, ABO group-matched and cytomegalic-antibody compatible donors. For neutrophil mobilization, donors received a single subcutaneous dose of glycosylated G-CSF (Lenograstim, Chugai Pharma, Japan) plus oral dexamethasone (8 mg) . In total, 168 (range 1-19 per patient) GTX were transfused in 32 children with a median age of 7.4 (0.25 to 16) years. Results: The underlying diseases comprised predominantly haematooncological malignancies (31 children). In 15 of 32 patients, neutropenia was related to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All children suffered from sepsis based on international criteria (fever, tachycardia, respiratory rate >2 SD above normal in the context of a suspected or proven infection). In ten children bacteria were isolated, in six children a fungal infection was diagnosed and four sepsis episodes were caused by viral infections. GTX contained a median neutrophil number of 6.3 (range 1.9-13.9)\u00d710 10 per transfusion and obtained a sustained haematological response after GTX. Nineteen out of 32 children survived the neutropenic sepsis, particularly nine out of 11 patients with bacterial sepsis. Discussion: In contrast to the non-survivors, we observed a significant decrease in the C-reactive protein levels shortly after initiation of the GTX treatment in the surviving patients. A clear-cut benefit of GTX for children with neutropenic sepsis cannot be concluded from these data, but in children with (severe) bacterial", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 532, "text": "(8 mg)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "G-CSF mobilised granulocyte transfusions in 32 paediatric patients with neutropenic sepsis"}, {"text": "Patients with prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy are prone to serious infections.

In children who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), mortality increases to 40% [2] . Given the generally improved prognosis for the treatment of childhood cancer, infections are of major concern to oncologists. Response rates in treating bacterial, fungal or viral infections during neutropenia remain unsatisfying [9, 23] .
