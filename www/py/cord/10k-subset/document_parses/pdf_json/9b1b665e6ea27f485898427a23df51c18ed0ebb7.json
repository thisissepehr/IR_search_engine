The main clinical symptoms are sudden onset of fever (.37.5uC), fatigue, marked anorexia, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, lymphadenopathy, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laboratory tests show thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased urine protein, and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.

However, only 8% of patients were positive for HGA infection, indicating that other pathogens likely contribute to this syndrome.

For our comparison, FTLSV sequences were mainly derived from viruses isolated from Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning and Shandong Provinces, and the close phylogenetic relationship among them indicated that the movement of FTLSV is common in China. At least two possible reasons for unencumbered movement of FTLSV: 1) there are no obvious physical barriers to prevent viral transmission, as the locations all correspond to plains or hilly regions of China; and 2) these regions share similar enzootic vectors and potential primate and non-primate reservoirs. Several papers have reported the isolation of FTLSV from two tick species (Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus) and domestic animals such as sheep, goat and cattle [4, 7, 8] . Furthermore, the analysis performed in this study suggest that FTLSV strains from Japan share a common ancestor with viral genotypes circulating in China, indicating that the virus has crossed the sea between China and Japan, forming the Japanese linage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 272, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 273, "end": 276, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1025, "end": 1028, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1031, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1034, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Evolution of FTLSV has impacted the sequence of all three viral RNA segments, creating unique viral genotypes and S, M and L RNA segment phylogenetic topologies indicate that FTLSV reassortment (particularly in the S segment) is not uncommon. Genetic reassortment can profoundly affect the pathogenicity and diversity of RNA viruses [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] . For example, reassortment among influenza virus strains (another RNA virus with a segmented genome) results in antigenic shift and the emergence of new pandemic strains [40] . The S segment of FTLSV encodes the N protein, which binds viral RNAs and encapsidates them in to ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) as well as the NS protein, which prevents the host interferon response by interfering with the cellular mRNAs and protein synthesis machineries of host cells. Reassortment of the S segment, therefore, could influence the replication and immunogenicity of the virus. The existence of many circulating genotypes in China and the wide distribution of potential vectors may increase the opportunity for reassortment to occur in FTLSV.

This issue is a potential limitation to the work reported here. Unfortunately, there is not a answer to the problem of underestimated the tMRCA due to purifying selection in molecular clock analysis of virus evolution. However, with advances currently being made in the development of increasingly more realistic evolutionary models, the bias imposed by the purifying selection may be solved in the foreseeable future. Still, given the apparent recent history of FTLSV, it is possible that the presence of purifying selection may not have a significant impact of the current evolution of the virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 272, "end": 275, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although the emergence of FTLSV and its association with FTLS was first confirmed during the summer of 2009 [1] , similar symptoms had been reported by hospitals near Huaiyangshan since 2007 [1] . Consistent with this, these results indicate that FTLSV has been circulating in China for many years. The reconstructed epidemic history of FTLSV suggests that the virus is a recently emerged pathogen that originated around the 18 th century. Bayesian analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor of the FTLSV strains existed an estimated 117 to 195 year prior to 2012. Similar estimates were obtained for the L, M and S segments, indicating that these segments have co-evolved. Lam et al. [31] reported that FTLSV originated from a common ancestor and most likely existed between 1817 and 1895, which is somewhat more recent estimate than the one proposed in this analysis. This difference might be explained in two ways. First, the evolutionary rate of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) was used as a model for the FTLSV analysis of Lam et al. Although RVFV and FTLSV both belong to the family Bunyaviridae, RVFV is mosquito-borne while FTLSV is tick-borne, and mosquito-borne RNA viruses are believed to evolve more rapidly than tick-borne viruses within the same family [43, 44] .

Huaiyangshan Mountain borders \\ Henan and Hubei Provinces in China; these provinces are the source of the Huaihe River, which forms the dividing line between southern and northern China. This biologically diverse region has been and remains a home to cultural and economic exchanges between the two halves of China. As FTLSV has been detected in the circulating tick vectors Haemaphysalis longicornis and Rhipicephalus microplus, which are widely distributed across China and globally, conditions exist for FTLSV to have been transmitted from Huaiyangshan to neighboring provinces in China [4] . BaTS analysis detected strong structuring of the FTLSV phylogeny by provinces or area, suggesting that in situ evolution has played an important role in the maintenance of FTLSV in China. Additionally, the results of the BaTS analysis that considered the extent of population subdivision between individual provinces or areas and all others as a group indicate that for two of the five provinces or areas sampled (i.e., Huaiyangshan, and Jiangsu), the observed FTLSV genetic diversity was shaped primarily by in situ evolution as opposed to extensive migration. This paper offers the first description of the movement of FTLSV in China. Our results indicate that this movement was slow during the early years of the spread, but has increasingly become more rapid in recent decades. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis showed that FTLSV arose in Huaiyangshan between 1756 and 1817, and then moved into the Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces between 1773 and 1834. Over the next hundred years, FTLSV continued to circulate through Jiangsu, Anhui and the Huaiyangshan region. Once FTLSV reached Jiangsu Province, this province became a secondary source of FTLSV spread, as the virus moved from Jiangsu Province into Liaoning Province between 1905 and 1943. In the past 50 or 60 years FTLSV has moved more rapidly, as the MCC tree shows that many strains isolated from Shandong, Liaoning and Anhui were recently introduced from Huaiyangshan and Jiangsu.

The recent dramatic increases in unregulated wildlife trade, livestock import/ export, and global human movement are likely to have created additional opportunities for spread of this severe disease.
