Trumenba is a bivalent meningococcal group B vaccine that contains two factor H binding proteins (fHBP) from Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) serogroup B. fHBP is a conserved, outer membrane 178 H. H. Mao and S. Chao lipoprotein and a virulence factor that contributes to the ability of the bacteria to avoid host defenses. Trumenba is a sterile suspension of two recombinant lipidated factor H binding protein (fHBP) variants, one from each of the two antigenically distinct fHBP subfamilies subfamily A and subfamily B (A05 and B01, respectively). These proteins are also known as rLP2086 proteins. The proteins are individually produced in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified. Each 0.5 mL dose of Trumenba is formulated to contain 60 \u03bcg of each fHBP variant subtype (120 \u03bcg total protein), 0.018 mg of polysorbate 80, and 0.25 mg of Al3+ as AlPO4 in 10 mM histidinebuffered saline at pH 6.0, according to the product insert [40] .
