In such cases, it can be challenging to maintain adequate gas exchange by conventional mechanical ventilation and at the same time prevent further ventilator-induced lung injury. We report a young HIV positive male with poorly compliant lungs and pneumomediastinum secondary to severe Pneumocystis infection, rescued with veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). Case presentation: A 26 year old male with no significant past medical history was admitted with fever, cough and shortness of breath. He initially required non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure. However, his respiratory function progressively deteriorated due to increasing pulmonary infiltrates and development of pneumomediastinum, eventually requiring endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. Despite attempts at optimizing gas exchange by ventilatory maneuvers, patients' pulmonary parameters worsened necessitating rescue ECMO therapy. The introduction of V-V ECMO facilitated the use of ultra-protective lung ventilation and prevented progression of pneumomediastinum, maintaining optimal gas exchange. It allowed time for the antibiotics to show effect and pulmonary parenchyma to heal. Further diagnostic workup revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii as the causative organism for pneumonia and serology confirmed Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Patient was successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials and de-cannulated after six days of ECMO support.

The most common manifestation on chest radiographs is bilateral interstitial or alveolar opacities. Parenchymal/sub-pleural cysts and pneumatoceles are frequently seen on CT scan. Spontaneous pneumothorax can occur in up to 36 % of patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [5, 6] . However, spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon complication with no reported incidence rates. The mechanism of spontaneous pneumomediastinum can be explained by the existence of a decreasing pressure gradient between the alveoli and the lung interstitium that can result in alveolar rupture. This leads to the accumulation of air in the interstitium that circulates centripetally through the venous sheaths to the hilum and mediastinum as the pressure in the mediastinum is lower than that of the lung periphery [7] . Our patient developed pneumomediastinum while on NIV. Barotrauma is very uncommon and pneumothorax following NIV occurs in less than 5 % of cases [8] . Development of pneumomediastinum in Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patient receiving NIV has been reported previously [9] .

The timing for initiation of V-V ECMO in severe respiratory failure remains debatable. However, based on previous studies it has been observed that increased pre-ECMO ventilation duration is associated with worse outcomes [16] . One of the exclusion criteria in CESAR trial was high pressure (>30 cm H 2 O of peak inspiratory pressure) and/or high FiO 2 (>0.8) ventilation >7 days [2] . In our patient the duration of pre-ECMO invasive ventilation was very short and this could be one of the contributing factor for his improved outcome. Fifty percent of the reported cases survived to hospital discharge. It is interesting to note that the patients who survived had a shorter duration of ECMO support (mean 9.25 versus 41 days).
