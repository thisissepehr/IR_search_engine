Classic models [6] give a fairly good description of the time evolution of infectious diseases. Most of the assumptions made in this traditional type of approach greatly simplify the analysis of the complex problem of the spreading of such illnesses among a certain number of individuals. However, in order to give account of the great variety of responses to the same viral infection and to distinguish among different social habits of different individuals, a network approach can be adopted [7, 9] . The topological issues addressed by the network approach are very important per se, since they find application in other fields, such as, for example, a e-mail: fromeo@sa.infn.it sociology [10] . In addition, they are useful in describing, more realistically, the problem and in defining the limits of validity of traditional models.",

The interaction between the S-I species is taken to be regulated by a constant statistical parameter \u03c0, while other horizontal cross-interactions are neglected. The time interval in which the S-species population is monitored is assumed to be small, in such a way that the total number of individuals can be thought to be constant over the entire observation period.",

Disease-free and epidemic regimes for the infectious disease, as also found by means of traditional approaches [6] , are defined by introducing the cross-over value\u03c0 c of the effective interaction parameter.

            "text": "(24) In equation (24) the role of the parameters \u03c0, N , and \u03c4 in the present model is clarified. Indeed, the dynamical behaviour of the system appears to be independent from the infectious period \u03c4 and from the population size N , since, from equation (24), the quantities \u03c4 and N simply rescale the infection rate \u03c0. We thus expect a universal behaviour of the observed experimental data, independently from the population size and for the recovery time interval \u03c4 . The only significant parameters in the universal curves are the effective interaction parameter \u03c0 , which in traditional models is referred to as contact number, and the initial percentage of infected individuals p 0 =\u03bc 0 N . As far as the duration of the infection is concerned, however, we shall see, in what follows, that the population size does play a role in determining the lower limit of the function \u00b5 n (t) = \u00b5n(t) N . We also notice that, by definition of the number of individuals in each species in equations (18a)-(18c) and by equation (24), we get: The integration of equation (24) is performed by standard numerical routines. In Figures 1a, 1b we report, for two different values of \u03c0, the time evolution of the function m (\u03be), in order to detect its continuity properties. Figure 3 we show the functions \u00b5, \u03c3, and \u03c1 normalized to N , which we indicate as \u00b5, \u03c3, and \u03c1, respectively, versus the normalized time \u03be = t \u03c4 , for p 0 = 0.01. In Figures 2a, 2b we have chosen a statistical parameter \u03c0 equal to 0.95, while in Figure 3 we have taken \u03c0 = 3.5. From these time-evolution curve, we first notice, starting with Figures 1a, 1b, that m (\u03be) is a monotonically increasing function and attains characteristic s-shape for \u03c0 > 1. In fact, in Figure 1a , obtained for p 0 = 0.01 and \u03c0 = 0.95, no clear inflection point can be detected in the curve, while in Figure 1b , obtained for p 0 = 0.01 and \u03c0 = 3.5, an inflection point can be clearly seen in the interval 1 < \u03be < 2. We also notice that, in correspondence to this feature, the model predicts a disease-free regime for \u03c0 < 1. In the particular case of Figures 2a, 2b, where \u03c0 = 0.95, the infection is present in the community for a rather long time, while the number of infected individuals is low at any instant of time. A different behavior can be seen when \u03c0 = 3.5, for example, as in Figure 3 , where an epidemic regime is detected. An interesting result is found when we let the population size N vary. As said in the previous section, one can argue that the dynamics of the phenomenon is not affected by the parameter N , since this extensive quantity collapses into the rescaled parameter \u03c0 after normalization. One cannot exclude, however, that observable quantities, like, for example, the duration of the malady expressed in terms of normalized time, would be independent of N . Indeed, by considering \u03c0 fixed, if N is increased, one needs to decrease the product \u03c0\u03c4 , which describes the average number of infected people in the normalized time interval I n = [(n \u2212 1) , n], n \u2265 1. In this way, the duration of the malady spreads over a longer normalized time interval. Numerically this result is obtained by adjusting the lower level of the normalized number of infected individuals when deciding at what instant of time the disease ends. Indeed, let us suppose that the population size is N 0 , then the duration of the malady is determined by intersecting the curves \u00b5 = \u00b5 (\u03be) and \u00b5 = 1 N0 , and by looking at the instant of time at which intersection of the two curves occurs. Therefore, if we consider the parameter \u03c0 fixed, but consider two population sizes, say N 1 and N 2 , with N 1 < N 2 , then we need to intersect the curves \u00b5 = 1 N1 and \u00b5 = 1 N2 with the same solution \u00b5 = \u00b5 (\u03be) of the dynamical equation (24). Let us assume that intersections occur, respectively, at normalized times \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 . Given that the curve \u00b5 = \u00b5 (\u03be) decreases to zero for \u03be 1, one can finally argue that \u03be 1 < \u03be 2 , as it appears from Figures 4a, 4b , where the duration of the infection versus the value of the statistical parameter \u03c0 is shown for p 0 = 0.01 and p 0 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , respectively. In these figures various values of the population size N have been used and we no- tice that, for increasing values of the population number, by keeping fixed \u03c0 and p 0 , the duration of the infection increases.",

In Figure 5a a clear landmark of the two different regimes, the disease-free regime and the epidemic one, is the abrupt crossover from a plateau in the \u03be Max vs. \u03c0 curves to a monotonously decreasing behaviour. This crossover appears around the value \u03c0 \u223c = 1, coherently with what noted before. This type of behaviour is well-known from standard epidemiological theories [6] , where the basic reproductive number R 0 , defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by the introduction of a single infected individual into an entirely susceptible population, is considered. Epidemic outbreaks are expected to appear, according to traditional models, if R 0 > 1. As for the present model, the transition between the two regimes, clearly detected in the \u03be Max vs. \u03c0 curves shown in Figure 5a , is also detectable in the \u00b5 Max vs. \u03c0 curves reported in Figure 5b . In the latter case, however, the rather sharp knee in the curves at low values of the initial percentage of infections disappears for higher values of p 0 , meaning that there In order to see more closely how the cross-over value \u03c0 c varies with the initial percentage of infected individuals, in Figure 6 we show a set of numerically evaluated points which give, for certain values of p 0 , the value of the interaction parameter leading to transition from the disease-free to the epidemic regime.

The population consists of S-, I-, R-species (respectively, susceptible, infected and recovered species). In the model a recovery time \u03c4 is introduced. This parameter acts as a delay time in the resulting non-linear delay-differential equations for the model. It has been noted that \u03c4 not only induces a natural way of normalizing the time variables, but also determines a time scan in the model, in such a way that a sequence of differential equations has to be found, one for each time interval I n = [(n \u2212 1) \u03c4, n\u03c4], with n \u2265 1. In order to solve more adequately these equations, a continuous variable m (t) is introduced. The time evolution of the restriction of m (t) on the time interval I n = [(n \u2212 1) \u03c4, n\u03c4 ], denoted as m n (t), is described by the dynamical equation found for that interval of time. The number of individuals belonging to the S-, I-, and R-species are expressed in terms of the functions m n (t), for each time interval I n , with n \u2265 1.

As we have also noticed in the previous sections, the introduction of the delay time \u03c4 changes the mathematical structure of the problem. Moreover, this feature is useful to describe the spread of the illnesses at the time of invasion, in such a way that the only necessary parameters for the model are the effective contact rate \u03c0 and the initial percentage of infected individuals p 0 . Owing to the reduction in the number of parameters, the threshold characteristics can be directly deducted from the dynamical behaviour of the system and, viceversa, the infectious disease history can be directly inferred when these parameters are known. Furthermore, this allows us to define a universal dynamics for these types of diseases in terms of a limited number of parameters, but does not exclude that the population size may play a role in determining observable quantities like, for example, the duration of the infection. Indeed, when the latter quantity is plotted against the parameter \u03c0, one notices different quantitative behaviour in the curves for different values of N . This behaviour can be interpreted by recalling the definition of the parameter \u03c0 itself and appears because of the need of defining a lower level for the normalized value of the fraction of infected individuals, below which the infection ceases to be present in the community. A clear distinction between two types of regimes, epidemic and disease-free, is attained by reporting the normalized value of the time at which the maximum in the curve of the percentage of infectious individuals appears. The cross-over value \u03c0 c of the effective interaction parameter is determined numerically in terms of the initial percentage of infected individuals p 0 . The bell-shaped curves describing the time evolution of the number of infections in the epidemic regime are seen to be in good qualitative agreement with available data on influenza. In medical and social science the model can find application as follows. Since our model present a universal behaviour, the disease dynamics can be studied in a small community, in order to obtain the relevant parameter \u03c0. It can then be generalized to a larger population of individuals, in order to adopt appropriate measures, which are to be induced by a political type of action.",
