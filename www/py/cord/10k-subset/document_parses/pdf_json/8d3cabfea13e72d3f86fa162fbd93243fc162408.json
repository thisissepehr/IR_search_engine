            "text": "Immunophenotyping, as the process of identifying discrete patient immune cell phenotypes, has gained prominent traction in areas such as HIV and leukemia research where perturbations in immune cell homeostasis directly reflect disease pathogenesis and correlate with patient prognosis. [1] [2] [3] Using flow cytometry, immune cell surface markers with bimodal distributions (which are either negative or positive in expression) allow unambiguous discrimination of immune cell profiles that correlate with clinical outcome, such as the presence CD8 \u00fe INF-g \u00fe double-positive cells in HIV patients and CD38 \u00fe peripheral blood cells in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. 1, 2 A potentially valuable yet underutilized area for lung disease immunophenotyping lies in the study of human alveolar macrophages (AMFs), which are the predominant immune cells within the alveolar airspaces. However, apart from the utilization of CD14 and CD16 to discern between classical CD14 \u00fe CD16 \u00c0 and patrolling CD14 low CD16 \u00fe monocytes (represented by CX 3 CR1 low Gr-1 \u00fe and CX 3 CR1 high Gr-1 \u00c0 counterparts in mice), 4 few macrophage (MF) surface markers exist in a convenient bimodal distribution pattern for disease-based characterization. Few are also identically expressed between mice and men. 5 This suggests two possibilities: that more translatable MF markers remain to be identified or there is an abundance of surface markers with continuous distributions that have rendered themselves inappropriate for traditional immunophenotyping. Considering the depth of study in the field of MF heterogeneity, the latter appears as the most likely option.",

            "text": "Over the past few years, personalized therapy of human lung diseases has been greatly advanced by the concept of disease endotypes, which links clinically observed phenotypes to underlying molecular mechanisms. 6 Endotyping asthma has successfully identified discrete patient subgroups who share a similar disease progression or treatment response, 7 reorganizing patient management through the implementation of more personalized treatment strategies. This asks whether a similar approach can be applied to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is mechanistically heterogeneous and involves high patient symptom burdens, which manifest independently of severe lung function decline. 8, 9 In particular, recent reports of a hyper-inflammatory COPD patient subgroup with increased disease mortality and acute lung exacerbations risk suggest that inflammatory and non-inflammatory disease endotypes may exist in COPD. 9, 10 This concept is emphasized by the existence of both immune and nonimmune driven mechanisms of emphysema induction in mice. [11] [12] [13] Interestingly, in mice, deletion of Src homology 2 domain-containing 5' inositol phosphatase-1 (Inpp5d or SHIP-1; a negative regulator of growth factor receptor-mediated myeloid cell activation and survival) or constitutive activation of Hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck; a Src-family kinase abundant in myelomonocytic cells) both lead to the spontaneous development of chronic inflammatory lung disease sharing features of human COPD. SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice develop AMF-driven chronic lung inflammation, severe emphysema, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and COPD co-morbidities, such as wasting, osteoporosis and an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. [19] [20] [21] Hck F/F gain-of-function mice, generated by a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution (Y499F) in the regulatory domain which prevents Hck inactivation, develop airway mucus metaplasia and mild emphysema characterized by chronic eosinophilic and monocytic lung inflammation and are hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 22 Further study of SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mouse models may thus help refine the search for hyper-inflammatory COPD endotypes.",

Under selective inflammatory conditions, CD11b expression is upregulated and differential CD11b pos AMF proportions can distinguish between the peak and resolution of acute lung inflammation, respectively. 15 This scenario (either an absence or presence of inflammation-associated CD11b pos AMFs) is ideal for immunophenotyping as binary CD11b expression negates interpretation ambiguities and excessive standardization procedures. In translating this to human patient samples, however, we discovered that CD11b was basally expressed on all human AMFs but varied noticeably between individual patients ( Figure 1a ). As MF markers rarely directly translate between man and mouse, we screened for other putative M^activation markers such as CD14, CD86, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II, CD124, CD206, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, and TLR-4 but observed consistently high or low surface expression levels (data not shown).",

Unfortunately, flow cytometry measurement of markers with a continuous distribution loses quantitative meaning outside single experiments as expression is presented as a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), a value which changes with cell autofluorescence, antibody (Ab) signal strength, and laser voltage settings. As MFI values are relative, large-scale clinical usage becomes limited even with single peak autofluorescent bead set-ups, as bead values still fluctuate within a small range between experiments and may diminish over time, hampering diagnostic accuracy. Thus, with continuous AM^CD11b expression as our marker of interest, we explored whether alternative analytical methods could still detect distinct lung immune cell profiles in both mice and humans using flow cytometry. To do this, we re-examined established mouse models of acute and chronic lung inflammation for potential internal anchors of AMF CD11b expression (gating strategy in Supplementary Figure S1 online).",

            "text": "We observed that blood neutrophil CD11b expression was surprisingly constant between phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle and LPS-challenged or Mem71 influenza virus-infected mice independent of lung pathology (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S1 online) . Similarly, we found that blood neutrophil CD11b expression remained constant in mice that spontaneously Overlay of BAL cell (blue) and blood neutrophil (red) staining with anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c Abs shows distinct inflammatory BAL profiles in individual mice (n \u00bc 3-6, right panel). AMF CD11b upregulation indicated as a rightwards shift of AMF CD11b expression with respect to blood neutrophils. (c) Flow cytometry confirms similar CD11b expression on blood neutrophils from SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 , Hck F/F , and C57BL/6 mice (n \u00bc 3, dotted gray: non-binding Ab controls, left panel).

(d, e) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of post-BAL inflation fixed lungs from flow cytometry-profiled mice (n \u00bc 4, bar \u00bc 100 mm). MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil. developed inflammatory lung disease (SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice; Figure 1c and Supplementary Table S1 online). In acute lung challenge studies, day 3 post-LPS challenge and day 10 post-influenza virus infection were chosen as they represent the peak of acute lung inflammation and initiation of disease resolution after virus is cleared, respectively, in these two different inflammatory conditions. In contrast to Mem71 infection, resolution at day 10 post-LPS challenge is characterized by a restoration to the homeostatic CD11b neg AM^phenotype. 15 In mice, blood neutrophils were CD11b pos with a staining intensity between the expression range of CD11b neg and CD11b high CD11c high AM^s, providing an internal reference point to which AM^CD11b expression could be compared (Figure 1b,c) . This approach negates influences from Ab signal strength and laser voltage settings on MFI level, as the ratio of AM^to blood neutrophil CD11b expression remains internally constant (see Supplementary Figure S2a and Supplementary Table S1 online). Differences in AM^CD11b expression and the appearance of CD11b high CD11c pos or CD11b pos CD11c neg cell subsets were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from C57BL/6 mice following LPS challenge and Mem71 influenza virus clearance and in SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice (see Supplementary Figure S2b ,c and Supplementary Table S1 online). 16, 17, 22 Increased AM^to blood neutrophil CD11b expression profiles were also observed for increasing LPS doses at day 3 post-challenge in C57BL/6 mice (see Supplementary Figure  S2d Figure 2a ) was also present in Mem71-infected and Hck F/F mouse BAL, which stained negatively for myeloid markers Class II, CD14, or CD86 ( Figure 2b ). Cell differentials using BAL cytospins, cell sorting, and Siglec F staining confirmed these cells as Siglec F pos lung eosinophils as previously reported (see Supplementary Figure 3S online and Figure 2c ; granular cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm as denoted by white arrows). 24 Identification of new immune cell parameters associated with acute lung exacerbations Acute exacerbations of COPD classically involve increased neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, 25, 26 although eosinophils have also been increasingly linked to exacerbation predisposition. 27 However, it remains unknown how conserved or heterogeneous this inflammatory milieu is between affected patients. SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice have spontaneous inflammatory and emphysematous phenotypes that resemble patterns observed in human COPD. 16, 17, 22 To test whether specific BAL profiles could also be discerned during COPD-like acute lung exacerbations, SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice were challenged with a single intranasal dose of LPS. LPS-challenged SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice both developed exacerbated lung pathology resembling acute lung pneumonia by day 3 post-LPS challenge ( Figure 3 ). In SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice, acute exacerbations were characterized by CD11b high CD11c pos monocyte recruitment and further AMF CD11b upregulation (Figure 3a -c,m). Exacerbation severity as evidenced by increased lung hemorrhaging, posture changes, piloerection, and increased respiratory effort was variable (data not shown) and correlated with the degree of AMF CD11b upregulation visualized as a rightwards signal shift of AMF CD11b expression compared with blood neutrophils ( Figure 3c) . Neutrophil, monocyte, and T lymphocyte numbers were also increased in LPS-challenged SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice (Figure 3d-f). AMF CD11b upregulation and lung monocyte recruitment were also characteristic of LPS-challenged Hck F/F mice (Figure 3i ,n). Upregulated AMF CD11b expression was modest compared with challenged SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice and did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3i ,n, *P \u00bc 0.087). Heightened lung neutrophil recruitment was the dominant feature of challenged Hck F/F mice, with no alterations in lung eosinophil numbers ( Figure 3j ). Interestingly, lung tissue and immune cell apoptosis was found in Hck F/F but not SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 acute lung exacerbations (see Supplementary Figure S4 online). Altogether, these results demonstrate that increased CD11b AMF expression is a mouse marker of active lung inflammation with differential patterns of AMF CD11b upregulation and eosinophil, neutrophil, or monocyte recruitment present in acute and chronic inflammatory lung conditions as well as COPD acute exacerbation models.",

Anti-CD11b Ab administration demonstrated a dose-dependent preferential neutralization of CD11b high neutrophils before CD11b high lung monocytes and CD11b pos AMFs (Figure 4e) . Anti-CD11b also attenuated lung neutrophilia in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4f,g) .

            "text": "As distinct BAL cell immunophenotypes were clearly discerned in mice, we investigated whether parallel immune cell features could be identified in humans. Blood neutrophil CD11b expression was similar between healthy volunteers and respiratory patients seen in the day clinic, although CD11b variation is higher in humans than in mice ( Figure 5a) . Nevertheless, 492% of all patient blood neutrophils existed within the same gated CD11b expression range used to reference AMF CD11b expression (see Supplementary Figure S6a For human BAL cell immunophenotyping, CD33 was chosen over CD11c as CD33 is a commonly used pan MF marker in humans, 28 which separated AMFs more clearly than CD11c in our studies and thus is a more definitive marker of human AMFs (see Supplementary Figure S7a online). As human lung monocytes are CD33 pos CD11b high and potentially similar to CD33 pos CD11b high AMFs, monocytes were excluded from our gating strategy based on their lack of autofluorescence and smaller size (low forward scatter (FSC)) to eliminate signal contamination (see Supplementary Figure S7b online). Despite this, an additional CD33 low CD11b high immune cell subset was still prominent in the BAL of a subset of human patients (Figure 5d , subset E). This subset showed negligible Class II, CD14, or CD86 expression ( Figure 5e ) and was identified as lung eosinophils from cell differentials of BAL cytospins (Figure 5f ; granular cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm as denoted by white arrows). This allowed the inclusion of lung eosinophilia as a parameter for immunophenotyping, similar to mice. The degree of lung neutrophilia, another preestablished parameter for COPD and asthma patient immunophenotyping, could simultaneously be measured as the proportion of granular CD15 high CD11b high cells in BAL (see Supplementary Figure S1 online and Figure 6a -d, pie charts).",

Using these parameters, we analyzed human BAL from a randomly sampled pool of patients undergoing bronchoscopies for clinical diagnosis (see Supplementary Table S3 online) . Human patients could be broadly segregated into one of four lung immunophenotypes: into patients with (a) only CD11b low AMFs, (b) only CD11b mod AMFs, (c) only CD11b high AMFs, and (d) CD11b mod/high AMFs with eosinophilia or atypical myeloid cell infiltration (Figure 6a-d) . Surprisingly, this mirrored the distinct immunophenotypes observed in C57BL/6 compared with SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice. Patients with CD11b low AMFs (set as having p10% AMFs with higher CD11b expression than blood neutrophils) showed low neutrophil and monocyte infiltration and most closely resembled the BAL phenotype of healthy C57BL/6 mice (Figure 6a) . Patients with CD11b mod AMFs were arbitrarily characterized to serve as an intermediate subgroup (with 10-40% CD11b pos AMFs with higher CD11b expression than blood neutrophils) to distinguish between patients with obvious CD11b low AMF or CD11b high AMF phenotypes (Figure 6b) . Patients with CD11b high AMFs (X40% AMFs with higher CD11b expression than blood neutrophils) but negligible monocyte or eosinophil recruitment greatly resembled the immunophenotype of SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice and showed increased CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T-cell proportions in BAL (Figure 6c) . Patients with CD11b mod/high AMFs and lung eosinophilia resembled the BAL cell immunophenotype of Hck F/F mice or C57BL/6 mice during the clearance phase of influenza infection (Figure 6d) . Interestingly, a unique subset of CD33 high CD11b low non-lymphocyte cells was additionally found in the BAL of PT5012 (Figure 6d) .

Our results demonstrate that patients with CD11b low or CD11b high AMFs exist and can be identified in a directly comparable manner. To represent AMF CD11b expression in an unbiased manner, we additionally calculated AMF CD11b MFIs and AMF to blood neutrophil CD11b MFI ratios for each patient (Figure 6a- As additional confirmation of CD11b selective AMF expression heterogeneity, we simultaneously measured AMF CD14 expression in the same experiment. In contrast to CD11b, CD14 AMF surface expression remained relatively constant between individual patients independently of AMF CD11b expression differences or lung disease status (Figure 6a-d) . Moreover, while blood neutrophil CD11b expression was relatively constant between patients, blood vs. lung neutrophil CD11b upregulation was observed in LPS-challenged C57BL/6 mice, SHIP-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and Hck F/F mice and human patients with similar inflammatory BAL cell profiles (see Supplementary Figure S9a ,b online). The degree of blood vs. lung neutrophil CD11b upregulation positively correlated with AMF CD11b upregulation (r \u00bc 0.806) and further distinguished between patients with CD11b low or CD11b mod/high AMFs, providing an additional parameter of local lung inflammation (see Supplementary  Figure S9b online).",

            "text": "A second obstacle lies in the difficulty of translating candidate MF markers from animal or in vitro studies. Few surface markers are similarly expressed on mouse and human AMFs. Translatable MF activation markers are so far limited to several chemokines, scavenger receptors, and matrix proteins. 5 As the only cell surface receptors from the list, scavenger receptors are the most pragmatic candidates for immunophenotyping. However, apart from MARCO, 36 few scavenger receptors are even dually expressed on mouse and human AMFs, let alone in parallel stimuli-selective patterns. More importantly, the expression of these and many other classes of MF surface proteins is predominantly continuous. 37, 38 Continuously expressed markers are represented as MFIs, which permits semi-quantitative comparisons within single flow cytometry experiments but hinders comparisons and data replication between independent studies. MFIs also do not provide information about cell population spread, may be altered by different gating strategies, and can be inadvertently skewed by extremely low or high value false events captured, future questioning their usefulness as meaningful clinical readouts. Thus, without alternative study strategies, many future candidate human MF markers may be rejected in the screening process in favor of binary observations, which are biologically unlikely. A conventional myeloid cell parameter would be the frequency of CD14 pos CD16 neg pro-inflammatory monocytes, CD14 pos CD16 pos vs. CD14 low CD16 pos patrolling monocytes in individual patients, 39 which can be used to describe the local environment in terms of recruited monocyte phenotypes. However, residential MFs possess different and often opposing functions to recruited monocytes and an understanding of residential MF responses may provide a more accurate reflection of the local inflammatory state. Using our flow cytometry approach, we show that AMF CD11b upregulation occurs in both mice and human patients alongside other inflammatory changes despite basal CD11b expression on human AMFs. In particular, our studies suggest that CD11b high AMFs may identify an important subset of patients with inflammatory lung conditions and that a combinational immunophenotyping approach that monitors AMF CD11b expression alongside the absence or presence of other innate immune cell subsets may provide a more personalized understanding of individual patient lung microenvironments.",

From our studies, given that anti-CD11b Ab administration but not CD11b deletion attenuated lung inflammation in mice, global CD11b deletion may not replicate the consequences of transiently targeting CD11b in chronic diseases. As blocking of surface AM^CD11b rather than depletion of CD11b pos AM^s most likely occurred following anti-CD11b Ab administration, it is crucial to dissect whether AM^CD11b signaling itself or CD11b pos/high AM^s are potential effectors of acute and chronic lung inflammation. Specifically, the comparison of CD11b neg (or CD11b low in humans) and CD11b pos/high AM^transcriptomes may identify whether alterations in CD11b-related signaling pathways or a broader array of effector pathways exist between these two AM^subpopulations.",

            "text": "AM^CD11b expression alterations have been previously described in clinical studies of acute and chronic inflammatory lung diseases. CD11b high AM^s correlated with increased lung monocyte influx and respiratory failure severity in a 21-day follow-up of ARDS patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 45 AM^CD11b upregulation was also observed in patients with pneumonia compared with healthy volunteers in a separate study that correlated CD11b AM^expression with the level of neutrophil chemokine interleukin-8. 46 Interestingly, AM^CD11b expression was not significantly different between COPD patients and healthy non-smokers in a previous study, though this may reflect a recruitment of inflammatory vs. non-inflammatory COPD endotypes. 47 Overall, the current diversity of CD11b AM^-and lung eosinophil-associated mouse models of emphysema temptingly suggests that distinct lung innate immune cell niches may be present in different COPD endotypes. Lung immunophenotyping in previously established COPD animal models may also help the field to more clearly differentiate immune-vs. non-immune-driven mechanisms of human COPD pathogenesis. 48 Although our approach can be immediately used in any flow cytometer facility, small caveats remain that apply to all lung immunophenotyping studies. Sample storage needs to be consistent for large-scale usage. 49 We used freshly obtained BAL samples for our studies in order to match the in vivo immunophenotype as closely as possible. This may be difficult in places where same-day flow cytometry analysis is not possible and cryopreservation options have to be explored. Cigarette smoke-induced cell autofluorescence is also a major obstacle as background AMF signals are exponentially increased in current smokers, confounding fluorescence AMF read-outs. Current cigarette smokers (o6 months) were excluded from our study, but this may be undesirable for COPD endotyping. In unavoidable scenarios, it is possible that non-fluorescence detection methods such as mass cytometry may be employed to characterize all samples from a similar baseline, although non-specific Ab-binding issues may still exist.",
