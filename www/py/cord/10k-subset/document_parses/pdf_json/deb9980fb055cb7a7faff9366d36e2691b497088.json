Effective passive dispersal requires both the transport of propagules and the establishment of populations large enough to be detected. At a global scale, biogeographic patterns of cladoceran zooplankton species suggest that effective dispersal among continents was originally rare, but greatly increased in the past century with expanded commerce. Genetic analysis allows some reconstruction of past dispersal events. Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA comparisons among New World and Old-World populations of several exotic cladocerans have provided estimates for likely source populations of colonists, their dispersal corridors, and timing of earlier dispersal events. Detecting the Old-World tropical exotic Daphnia lumholtzi early in its invasion of North America has allowed detailed analysis of its spatial spread. Twelve years of collection records indicate a rapid invasion of reservoirs in the United States, by both regional spread and long-distance jumps to new regions. Combining landscape features with zooplankton surveys from southcentral US reservoirs revealed higher colonization rates of D. lumholtzi at lower landscape positions, a result which can be explained by either greater propagule load or by higher susceptibility of these downstream reservoirs. Because invaded reservoirs provide a source of propagules for nearby floodplain ponds, the rarity of this species in ponds suggests limitation by local environments. Such analyses of invading species over multiple spatial scales allow a better understanding of ecological processes governing invasion dynamics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Spatial scaling influences a wide variety of processes as well as human perception of patterns in nature. For instance, plant distributions are often patchy at a coarse scale, but random within habitat patches. Failure to recognize scaling effects has contributed to several controversies in ecology, including the relative importance of physical and biological processes on the distribution of marine phytoplankton (Wiens 1989) . The frequency of dispersal in freshwater zooplankton communities is another area of current disagreement (Bohonak and Jenkins 2003; Louette and De Meester 2005) . In particular, differences of opinion exist on how common are fast-dispersing species in nature and how quickly communities develop resistance to invasion. For small invertebrates like zooplankton, detecting a new population requires that a species has already established large numbers; thus descriptions of their dispersal are ordinarily referring to effective dispersal (colonization). As pointed out by (Bohonak and Jenkins 2003) , colonization depends on time scale and the perspective of the investigation. Similarly, spatial scale affects invasion dynamics (Shigesada and Kawasaki 1997) and the resulting patterns of species richness . Development of dispersal theory can thus benefit from empirical data at different scales of time and space.

Cladocerans, like many other freshwater invertebrates, are capable of asexual reproduction and hence a single individual can found a new population (Dodson and Frey 2001) . Cladocerans also form resting eggs and, in many genera, these are encased in a hard capsule (''ephippium''). Ephippia can resist freezing and desiccation, which allows surviving hostile terrestrial conditions. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated viable gut passage in fish and birds (Proctor and Malone 1965; Mellors 1975; Figuerola et al. 2003) .

Using standard techniques (Havel et al. 2000b ), we collected zooplankton from the water column and hatched resting eggs from the sediments. Over all the 29 ponds, we detected 41 species of crustacean zooplankton, 20 of them present in both the lake and the ponds. D. lumholtzi was present in only two of the ponds. Since D. lumholtzi tends to be most common in local reservoirs during July-September (Havel et al. 1995) , we re-analyzed the 10-year flooding data restricted to those three months and found that 28 of the ponds experienced at least two inundation events. D. lumholtzi in the water column or their dormant eggs in the near-surface sediments should have been available to invade the ponds during these periods. Since it appears likely that D. lumholtzi propagules would have been transported from the lake into most floodplain ponds, the absence of this species suggests limitation by local environmental conditions. For instance, the ponds might lack deepwater refuges from UV radiation or from fish predators introduced during high water periods.

The surveys for exotic zooplankton described above have revealed possible limiting factors to invasions over broad spatial scales. However, confirming the mechanisms for these patterns requires experiments, which to date have been more local in their scale. A recent series of experiments from Michigan showed convincingly the resistance of local zooplankton communities to invasion. Shurin (2000) introduced invaders from the regional species pool into zooplankton communities of 11 fishless ponds held in large field enclosures. Most species failed to invade intact communities, whereas native communities reduced in density allowed fourfold more novel invaders.

At what intermediate spatial scale does this transition occur? Study of range expansion, together with new statistical techniques, offers a way to assess the effect of spatial scale on invasion success. In particular, we would like to estimate the shape of the dispersal probabilitywith-distance function (''dispersal kernel'') (Clark 1998 A seven-year data set on range expansion of D. lumholtzi and lake characteristics in Missouri USA allowed modeling the features most important in controlling its range expansion. Havel et al. (2002) combined local environmental variables and spatial position of all invaded and susceptible reservoirs into multiple logistic regression models. First, potential dispersal was included through a variable describing the propagule load experienced by each susceptible lake, based on its position relative to all known potential source lakes (those invaded in previous years). The shape of the dispersal kernel is unknown and was estimated from the data, using both exponential and Gaussian models. After varying the value of the dispersal parameter over a wide range, maximum likelihood techniques were used to find which value of the parameter offered the best agreement between the model and the data. Next, in order to compare the importance of dispersal (propagule load) relative to local environmental constraints (water chemistry, temperature, and lake morphometry), Havel et al. (2002) compared logistic regression models containing only local variables, only the dispersal parameter, and both together. The results showed that physico-chemical factors (particularly area and temperature) were more important than distance for predicting invasion likelihood. However, including the dispersal term along with the local terms improved the fit of the model in most years studied and the shape of the dispersal kernel was highly consistent among years. The probability of invasion declined sharply up to about 20 km from a source, and remained relatively constant at greater distances .

The fact that other recently studied cladoceran invaders (B. longimanus, E. coregoni) have more restricted distributions implies that these species are less invasive, but the underlying causes are less clear. Such a pattern could be due to differences among species in the density of individuals in contact with boats, with their survival in transit, or with their ability to survive and reproduce in their new environments. Since B. longimanus, E. coregoni have been invading different kinds of landscapes (natural lakes) than D. lumholtzi (reservoirs), it is also possible that the higher invasion rate of D. lumholtzi is simply a consequence of reservoirs being more invasible than natural lakes.
