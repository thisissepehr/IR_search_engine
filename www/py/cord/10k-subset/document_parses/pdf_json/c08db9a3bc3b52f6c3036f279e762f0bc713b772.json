[7] [8] [9] Donor source also has a key role in MDS transplant outcomes. A recent CIBMTR (Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry) analysis comparing the outcomes of adult MDS patients undergoing a sibling or adult matched unrelated donor (MUD) HCT receiving MA or RIC highlighted diminished survival, increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) and increased incidence of severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) with unrelated donors compared with siblings. 10 In contrast, a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) analysis of 1333 MDS patients aged 450 years receiving either a sibling or MUD donor transplant revealed similar 4-year survival at approximately 31% with advanced disease at HCT the primary variable impacting survival but increased NRM with unrelated donor source. 11 Although comparisons of sibling and unrelated donor transplants in MDS are readily available, the literature comparing sibling donors and umbilical cord blood (UCB) is less developed.

Our data highlighted similar outcomes regardless of sibling or UCB donor source and confirm the ability of well-established cytogenetic classification models to predict post-HCT survival and relapse in our patient population. Sibling donors remain the donor of choice for patients requiring transplant; however, when siblings are not available controversy exists regarding the next best option. Although comparisons of sibling and unrelated donor transplants in MDS are readily available, the literature investigating UCB is less developed. Our institutional alternative donor HCT research interest has pioneered the field of UCB transplantation. When an urgent HCT is needed and few unrelated donor options are available, our institutional alternative donor choice is an UCB source. Our current data highlight similar outcomes regardless of donor source and are consistent with previous publications from our institution with respect the MDS and AML outcomes. 19, 26 To date, the largest MDS UCB outcomes analysis was a recent 2015 Eurocord-EBMT analysis highlighting the outcomes of MDS adults undergoing either UCB (n = 129) or peripheral blood MUD (n = 502) RIC HCT. In this analysis, 2-year survival ranged from 30% for UCB to 50% for MUD (P o 0.0001) with similar relapse incidence across donors (23% MUD to 30% UCB) but increased NRM at 42% for UCB compared with 31% for PB MUD (P = 0.03). Based on these data, the authors concluded that PB MUD donors were the preferred stem cell source compared with UCB in the absence of a sibling donor. 27 Although the outcomes of this study highlight a much larger 'MDS' patient cohort, it is important to note that 65% of the MDS patients within the entire cohort had progressed to AML prior to transplantation, and of those patients, only 52% had achieved remission prior to transplant. Specifically, within the UCB group 71% had progressed to AML and only 48% had achieved CR prior to transplant. This study is thus limited by the heterogeneity of patients/conditioning regimens/supportive care inherent in a registry study and the small number of true MDS patients not progressing to AML receiving an UCB HCT (n = 37). 27 Despite these limitations, the analysis importantly highlights surprisingly good outcomes of survival and relapse for such a high-risk group of patients with the majority of the MDS patients progressing to AML, only half in remission, and receiving only RIC. Thus these data suggest that both MUD/UCB RIC transplants can be effective in curing even high-risk MDS/AML patients. Although our study is limited by a relatively small total sample size with shorter followup in the UCB cohort, the 44 patients with true MDS undergoing HCT with an UCB donor source represents the largest published population of such patients to date. The experience at the University of Minnesota developing and fine tuning the approach to UCB transplantation (utilizing UCB in the setting of an urgent transplant need with few unrelated donor options and avoiding use in the setting of extensive marrow fibrosis) along with the Abbreviations: aGVHD = acute GVHD; ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; cGVHD = chronic GVHD; COD = cause of death; UCB = umbilical cord blood. consistent conditioning platform and supportive care across all patients likely partially explains these differential outcomes between our study and the EBMT-Eurocord analysis. Predicting outcomes after HCT remains an ongoing area of intense research in MDS. If we can better identify who will do well, or very poorly, with transplant and what prior therapy optimizes disease burden prior to HCT, then we can improve outcomes for patients and eliminate transplant-related risks for those who are unlikely to benefit. Numerous publications have investigated MDS characteristics that may impact HCT outcomes looking at disease burden based on bone marrow blast percentage at the time of transplant, 1,2,8 R-IPSS cytogenetic risk grouping, 8 MK 7 and cytogenetic disease burden by percentage of cytogenetically abnormal cells, 9 with the general consensus that MK, poor/very-poor R-IPSS cytogenetics, high blast percentage at transplant and high disease burden by percentage of cytogenetically abnormal cells, are adverse predictors of transplant outcomes.
