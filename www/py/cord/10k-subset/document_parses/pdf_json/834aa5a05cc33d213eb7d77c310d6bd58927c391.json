The credibility or otherwise of electron microscopy (EM) as a tool in such studies depends to a considerable extent on the ability of its practitioners to distinguish viral agents from artefactual, pathological, or normally occurring non-viral structures. Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than in the extensive literature on 'virus-like particles' in the brain in multiple sclerosis (MS) (Andrews, 1972; Hill, 1973; Mirra and Takei, 1976; Kirk and Hutchinson, 1978) .",

The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically (Dr. I. V. Allen).

They presented as an array of circular electron-lucid structures set against a dark background. At high magnification it was apparent that they were spheroidal vesicles and that the dense background was composed of the fused outer layer of their bounding walls or membranes (Fig. 1, inset) . 0001-6322/79/0048/0063/$1.00 These-had a trilamellar substructure formed by two dense granular layers separated by a relatively electronlucid intermediate layer. The outer dense layer was the thicker of the two but was ill-defined (fuzzy). The overatt outer dimensions o f these vesicles (discounting the outer fuzziness), ranged from 50 nm to 60 nm. In the same case but in different blocks, a small number of abnormal myelin sheaths was seen. Such sheaths were generally thin and were characterised by the presence of a variety of associated honeycomb, tubular, and vesicular structures (Fig. 2) , At high magnification the vesicular structures were seen to have trilamellar walls whose derivation from myelin lamellae was clearly demonstrable (Fig. 3) . A fuller description of these appearances, which are interpreted as representing 'vesicular' demyelination, is given in a previous paper (Kirk, 1979) . Isolated hollow-cored vesicles remote from myelin and of the kind illustrated in Fig. 1 were unique in our study and have not been seen in any other cases which the author has examined either in MS or in controls. However, they bore a very close resemblance to the vesicles illustrated in Fig. 2 , which were seen in association with degenerating myelin in this and other cases (e.g., Kirk, 1979) .",

For example, there are reports in the CNS pathological literature of small groups of clumped parallel tubules or 'paracrystalline lattices' of u n k n o w n significance but mainly found in poorly fixed material (Kaiya et al., 1976; Johnson et al., 1976; Friede, 1978) . At low magnification transverse sections of these structures closely resemble the structures seen in the present case. However, closer examination reveals fundamental differences in size ( 3 0 -4 0 nm as against 5 0 -6 0 n m diameter), in wall structure (single granular as against trilamellar), and in uniformity of apparent lumen size (uniform as against variable to absent). Also, these authors were able to demonstrate longitudinal sections of the tubular components whereas in the present case examination of adjacent sections on either side of that which contained the vesicles revealed no such inclusions. This confirmed the impression that the inclusions were essentially spheroidal rather than cylindrical.",

It is now apparent that the first of these (Field and Raine, 1964) were the internal vesicles of a normally occurring variety of lysosome, the multivesicular body (Roizin et al., 1967) . The second and third particles, both reported by Narang and Field (1973) , were subsequently shown to be indistinguishable from nuclear-pore type annuli and altered axonal mitochondria, respectively (Hill, 1973) . The fourth and most interesting kind of particle, found in a single case of MS was said to resemble mature intracisternal coronavirus (Tanaka et al., 1976) . The particles found in the present case differ morphologically from all those described previously. However, comparison with some of the myelin-related circular structures (Fig. 2) shows many points of close similarity including overall size, lumenal size variation, wall structure, extracellular location, and clumped appearance. It is, therefore, concluded that the most likely interpretation of the perivascular hollow-cored vesicles is that they are derived from myelin undergoing vesicular demyelination.",

The extent to which the observed appearances of vesicular dissolution of myelin could result from autolytic or fixation effects has been considered elsewhere (Kirk, 1979) where it was concluded on the basis of the limited published evidence that such effects were unlikely to be of major significance at least within the first 6 h of death.",

These latter structures are invariably intracellular the myelin derived tubules being enclosed wilhin membranes originating as invaginations of the phagocytic microglia. The structures described in the present paper, however, seem on the whole to be extracellular. However, it should be readily apparent that if a phagocyte was to endocytose vesicles and tubules derived from vesicular demyelination the resulting structures would be morphologically virtually identical to those resulting from micropinocytosis vermiformis. Indeed, one of the illustrations (Fig. 11) in Prineas and Connell's paper could be interpreted as the endocytotic uptake of tubular myelin. The implication is that some tubular-vesicular disruption of the myelin sheath, occurring extracellularily, preceded the micropinocytosis vermiformis. It is interesting to note, however, that micropinocytosis vermiformis has not yet been described as an accompaniment of vesicular demyelination in animal models of demyelinating diseases 1.",

The origins of such particles should first be sought in normal sub-cellular structures with due consideration being given to the possible effects of disease changes, postmortem autolysis, fixation artefact and species differences. Rigorous application of such an approach (e.g., Hill, 1973; Lampert and Lampert, 1975; Kirk and Hutchinson, 1978) has already facilitated the removal of several putative viruses (Prineas, 1972; Narang and Field, 1973; Bauer et al., 1975; Pathak and Webb, 1976) from the list of possible etiological agents in MS.",

However, unlike Prineas and Connell the authors interpreted the appearances without reference to a micropinocytotic mechanism. Rather they suggested that \"some of the vermiform profiles resulted from an abnormal proliferation of oligodendrocyte processes and extensive infolding of their plasma membranes\". If this should prove to be the case in MS also, then the distinction be-tween this phenomenon and \"tubular-vesicular\" demyelination would become even more clear cut.",
