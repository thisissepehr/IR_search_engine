Although F. tularensis is considered to be a potential biological weapon due to its high infectivity and mortality rate, no vaccine has been currently licensed. Recently, we reported that F. tularensis SCHU P9 derived \u0394pdpC strain lacking the pathogenicity determinant protein C gene conferred stable and good protection in a mouse lethal model. In this study, the protective effect of \u0394pdpC was evaluated using a monkey lethal model. Two cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) intratracheally challenged with the virulent strain SCHU P9 were euthanized on 7 and 11 days post-challenge after the development of severe clinical signs. The bacterial replication in alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells in the lungs would cause severe pneumonia accompanied by necrosis. Conversely, two animals subcutaneously immunized with \u0394pdpC survived 3 weeks after SCHU P9 challenge. Though one of the two animals developed mild symptoms of tularemia, bacterial replication was limited in the respiratory organs, which may be due to a high level of humoral and cellular immune responses against F. tularensis. These results suggest that the \u0394pdpC mutant would be a safe and promising candidate as a live attenuated tularemia vaccine.",

F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, isolated predominantly in North America, is one of the most infectious bacteria with a minimum infective dose to human as low as 10 colony forming unit (CFU) [2] [3] [4] . If an appropriate antibiotic is not timely administered, the mortality rate is 5% to 30% 5 . F. tularensis subsp. tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, thus it is considered a potential threat as a biological weapon.

The first vaccine for tularemia was a heat-killed F. tularensis produced by Lee Foshay in 1930 7 . During the Second World War, live attenuated vaccines were developed and found to be protective 8 . In 1956, ampoules of a viable mixture of attenuated tularemia vaccine were transferred to the United States from the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology Imeni N. F. Gamaleia (Gamaleia Institute) in the former Soviet Union by Shope 8 . From this mixture, a strain of the attenuated phenotype was selected, evaluated for safety, and designated as F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) 9 . In human volunteers, the LVS was found to protect against the intracutaneous challenge of SCHU S4 but not against respiratory challenge 3, 10 . More recently, various mutant strains based on LVS against F. tularensis (such as \u0394SodB 11 and \u0394dsbA 12 ), F. novicida (such as \u0394IglD 13 and \u0394iglB 14 ), and F. tularensis strain SCHU S4 (such as \u0394clpB 15 and \u0394ggt 16 ) were found to be attenuated with some protective capacity against the virulent strain SCHU S4 in mice or rats. However, there is currently no licensed vaccine against tularemia 17 . Thus, development of a safe and efficacious tularemia vaccine is still crucial.",

Among these animal models to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine, macaques develop clinical signs of pulmonary infection, quite similar to those in humans due to their close genetic backgrounds [19] [20] [21] . Tularemia outbreaks in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) 22 and rhesus (Macaca mulatta) 23 macaques have also been reported. Previous studies have reported that macaques died 5 to 11 days post-challenge (dpc) with a virulent strain. The target organs in macaques and humans include the lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes 21, 22, 24 . Thus, a macaque model is well-suited to study the pathogenesis of tularemia and develop countermeasures in humans 3, 10 . In fact, macaque models were used to evaluate the pathogenicity of tularemia pathogenicity in the early 1970s [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and to evaluate candidate tularemia vaccines in the 1960s [29] [30] [31] [32] . The cynomolgus macaque is a better model of inhalation tularemia than the rhesus macaque 33 , as the pathology of cynomolgus macaques infected with aerosolized F. tularensis is similar to those observed in human inhalation tularemia 20 . The 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of the virulent strain SCHU S4 in cynomolgus macaque is approximately 20 CFU via aerosol infection 10, 33 .",

Since F. tularensis is intracellular bacteria and the LPS antigens were found in the cells in the lung lesion, double immunohistochemical staining of the lung lesions was conducted with anti-F. tularensis LPS monoclonal Ab and an Ab against the cell marker. The results showed that bacteria invaded not only macrophages ( Fig. 5A ) but also other cells (Fig. 5B ), which were shown to be ACE2 positive alveolar epithelial type II (AT-II) cells (Fig. 5C ).",

In addition to natural infection of humans and animals, its potential to be used as a biological weapon highlights the necessity to develop effective vaccines to protect against this pathogen. Among the many methods applied to this disease, attenuated live vaccines are often applied 18, 36 . A previous study reported that the \u2206pdpC mutant strain had the potential to protect mice from lethal intranasal challenge with a virulent strain via subcutaneous immunization 34 . The pdpC gene of the virulent strain SCHU P9 was disrupted by group II intron insertion using the TargeTron gene knockout system 37, 38 to generate the \u0394pdpC mutant strain 39 . Thus, the genetic stability of strain \u2206pdpC was confirmed by in vivo passages in mice for 10 generations 34 . These data suggest that the mutant strain \u0394pdpC is a promising vaccine candidate for tularemia. To further evaluate the possibility of \u0394pdpC as a candidate tularemia vaccine, a lethal cynomolgus macaque model was employed in this study to analyze a protective potential of \u0394pdpC.",

As a potential agent of bioterrorism, the animals in this study were experimentally inoculated with F. tularensis intranasally or intratracheally. After inoculation, the bacteria arrive in the alveolar airspace and are immediately phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and inactivated in phagolysosomes. However, F. tularensis can replicate efficiently in macrophages. [43] [44] [45] . Therefore, we tried to confirm the infection of alveolar macrophages and AT-II cells in the lungs of cynomolgus macaques. For immunohistochemical analysis of cynomolgus macaque, CD68, which is expressed specifically by monocytes, is often used to identify macrophages. AT-II cells in the lungs, which can be identified using Abs against angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), play a key role in the homeostasis in the renin-angiotensin system. In this study, the infection of alveolar macrophages and AT-II cells in cynomolgus macaque were confirmed using Abs against CD68 and ACE2, respectively, accompanied with Abs against F. tularensis LPS. The infected macrophages, which were double stained with anti-CD68 and anti-F. tularensis LPS Abs, were found in the lungs of the monkeys in Group 2 (Fig. 5A) . Simultaneously, the infected AT-II cells that were double stained with anti-ACE2 and anti-F. tularensis LPS Abs were also observed in the lungs (Fig. 5C ). These findings were first confirmed in nonhuman primates and strongly suggest that F. tularensis efficiently infects and replicates in AT-II cells after respiratory inoculation in vivo, as reported by several researchers [43] [44] [45] . Thus, it is likely that infected AT-II cells, as well as the infected macrophages, play a crucial role in the development of severe tularemia pneumonia.",

In the present study, IgM and IgG ELISAs showed that F. tularensis-specific Abs were elicited in the animals in Group 1 after subcutaneous vaccination with strain \u2206pdpC and intratracheal challenge with the virulent strain SHCU P9 (Fig. 7A,B) . The induction of F. tularensis-specific Abs was also detected with the MA test (Fig. 7C ) and WB analysis (Fig. 7D,E) . It has been reported that when infected by F. tularensis by inhalation, dried strips originated from the antigen transferred PVDF membrane were reacted with periodically collected serum samples of the animals and they were aligned on white papers. The grayscale images of the papers were scanned using DocuCentre-IV C2263 (Fuji Xerox, Tokyo, Japan) at superfine resolution (600 dpi) and saved as JPEG format files. The image processing was done using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Inc, San Jose, CA, USA) to crop the images but brightness and contrast adjustment were not done. The full-length blots are shown in the figure. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ serum Abs contribute to protecting against tularemia by preventing the spread of bacteria from the lungs to the liver and spleen while facilitating rapid bacterial clearance in the lung, which offers a considerable survival advantage 46, 48 . The Ab titer in animal #4552 had increased after vaccination with strain \u2206pdpC, as compared to animal #4550. Animal #4552 had no symptoms of tularemia, whereas the body weight of animal #4550 had decreased (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that the stronger Ab response induced in animal #4552 contributed to protection against tularemia. The difference in protective immunity between these two animals may be due to differences in genetic backgrounds. In fact, vaccine testing in humans showed different protection effects among individual volunteers from asymptomatic to mild to severe 3, 10, 49 . In animal #4550, however, although all bacteria were not cleared from the trachea and lungs (Fig. 6) , bacterial growth was limited in these organs, indicating a protective effect inhibiting the spread of the bacteria to other organs and tissues.",

            "text": "The protective effect of Ab generally supports the neutralization of bacterial infectivity and the lysis of the bacterial membrane by the complement system. However, F. tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can replicate in multiple types of eukaryotic cells including phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Since the Ab is not able to directly react with the intracellular bacteria, the cellular immune responses might be also important to restrict the intracellular replication in F. tularensis, as well as humoral immune responses. For example, cytotoxicity T cells (CTL) playing a central role in cellular immune responses were indispensable for the escape from lethal infection of intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes 50 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis 51 . Several reports have shown that IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) that could evoke cellular immune responses were indispensable to prevent lethal infection in F. tularensis [52] [53] [54] . However, it was uncertain that CTL could contribute to restricting the bacterial replication in F. tularensis. In this study, PBMCs collected at 0 dpc (before challenge) were applied to IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay (Fig. 8A) . The abundant IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells were detected in the PBMCs of the animals #4550 and #4552 in Group 1. Especially, the highest level of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cells in PBMCs and the Ab responses were induced in the animal #4552 among the six animals (Fig. 8B) . Since animal #4552 did not show any clinical signs at all (Fig. 2) , it might be suggested that the synergy between cellular and humoral immune responses contributed to the forceful prevention from the lethal challenge of SCHU P9.",

Similarly, because high levels of MA test titers in two animals in Group 1 (animal #4550 and #4552) were confirmed at 3 weeks post vaccination in this study, the two animals were intratracheally challenged with virulent strain SCHU P9 at 3 weeks post-vaccination. The specific T cells stimulated by the strain SCHU P9 antigen were confirmed in animals #4450 and #4552 in Group 1 by performing the ELISPOT assay. Moreover, abundant IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells without the stimulation were also shown in the PBMCs of animal #4552 in Group 1 (Fig. 8A) because of the elevated immune responses that continued for up to 3 weeks post vaccination. These findings suggest that the elevated immune response contributed to survival from the lethal challenge in animal #4552 in Group 1. Conversely, it would have been preferable to have increased the time until the challenge to evaluate the acquired immune responses in accordance with previous reports of macaques that were challenged with the virulent strain at 1 and 2 months post vaccination 13, 30 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The route of vaccination also influences the immune response against invading pathogens 55 . The results of this study demonstrated that F. tularensis-specific Ab responses after inoculation with strain \u2206pdpC differed between animals inoculated subcutaneously (Group 1) and those inoculated intratracheally (Group 3). The animals in the two groups were inoculated with the same dose of strain \u2206pdpC, whereas subcutaneous inoculation with strain \u2206pdpC induced higher Ab responses than intratracheal inoculation. Thus, an optimal route of administration, as well as suitable strain for the vaccine, should be considered to induce better protection against tularemia.",

Briefly, colonies of strain SCHU P9 were cultured on Eugon chocolate agar for 3 days, harvested, suspended in saline, adjusted to the concentration corresponding to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) = 1.0, and inactivated at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. The SCHU P9 antigen was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Heat-killed SCHU P9 antigen, centrifuged and diluted to 1:5 in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) was added to the wells (100 \u03bcl/well) of a Nunc-Immuno plate (Thermo Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark), which were incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. After washing thrice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) to remove unbound antigen, all wells were blocked with 100 \u03bcl of PBST containing 3% skim milk at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After washing thrice with PBST, 50 \u03bcl of the serum samples diluted to 1:2000 in PBST containing 1% skim milk were added to antigen-coated wells in duplicate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. After washing thrice with PBST, 50 \u03bcl of anti-monkey IgM (mu chain) (goat) HRP-conjugated Ab (Rockland Immunochemicals, Pottstown, PA, USA) or anti-monkey IgG (whole molecule) HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab produced (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation) diluted to 1:10,000 were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The wells were washed thrice with PBST and developed with 100 \u03bcl of 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) ELISA HRP substrate (Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The optical density at 405 nm (OD 405 ) of each well was measured using a microplate reader (iMark; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Ab responses measured by MA test. Abs in serum samples were also detected using the MA test 58 .",

The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h and checked for agglutination. F. tularensis immunized rabbit serum was used as a positive control, and normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control. The Ab titer in MA was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution showing a positive response to the antigens. Agglutination at dilutions of 1:10 or greater were considered as positive for the MA Ab. Ab responses as determined by WB analysis. WB analysis was performed as described previously to detect F. tularensis-specific Ab in serum 58 . Suspensions of SCHU P9 were adjusted to OD 600 = 1.0, mixed with the same volume of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and inactivated at 100 \u00b0C for 5 min. Whole-cell lysates of F. tularensis SCHU P9 were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 5-20% precast polyacrylamide two-well gels (e-PAGEL HR, EHR-MD520L, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Antigens were electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). After incubating in PBST with 3% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was washed thrice with PBST for 5 min, partially dried, and cut into small strips. The sera were diluted to 1:1000 in PBST containing 1% skim milk and incubated with PVDF membrane strips at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the membrane strips were washed thrice in PBST for 5 min each, incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-monkey IgG (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-monkey IgM (Rockland Immunochemicals) at a dilution of 1: 4000 at room temperature for 1 h, and then washed thrice in PBST for 5 min each. Afterward, the reactions were visualized by incubation with 0.02% DAB and 0.003% H 2 O 2 in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.6) for 10 min, and washed twice with distilled water. Samples were considered to contain specific Abs when the typical ladder-pattern was recognized 59 . The individual dried strips originated from the antigen transferred PVDF membrane were reacted with periodically collected serum samples of the animals and they were aligned on white papers. The grayscale images of the papers were scanned using DocuCentre-IV C2263 (Fuji Xerox, Tokyo, Japan) at superfine resolution (600 dpi) and saved as JPEG format files. The image",
