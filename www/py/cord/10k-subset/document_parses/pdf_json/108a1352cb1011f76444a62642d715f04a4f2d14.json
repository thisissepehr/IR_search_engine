Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues. The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function. Indeed, genetically engineered recombinant probiotics are promising treatment strategies offering delivery of therapeutic proteins with precision. An Ang(1-7) secreting Lactobacillus paracasei (LP) or LP-A has been described for regulation of diabetes and hypertension; however, we are the first to the best of our knowledge to propose this paradigm as it relates to aging. In this Research Practice manuscript, we provide proof of concept for using this technology in a well-characterized rodent model of aging: the Fisher344 x Brown Norway Rat (F344BN). Our primary findings suggest that LP-A increases circulating levels of Ang(1-7) both acutely and chronically (after 8 or 28 treatment days) when administered 3\u00d7 or 7\u00d7/week over 4 weeks. Our future preclinical studies will explore the impact of this treatment on gut and other age-sensitive distal tissues such as brain and muscle.",

            "text": "In recent years a number of pleiotropic effects have been ascribed to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) beyond modulating blood pressure (1, 2) . Classically, the canonical RAS was thought to function primarily by balancing the vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II (AngII) binding to the AT1 receptor (AT1R) with the actions of bradykinin-a potent vasodilatory substance. However, an adjunctive RAS axis was recently discovered, which functions by binding of the peptide angiotensin (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) or Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) to the Mas (AT7) receptor. In contrast to the vasoconstrictive actions of the AngII/AT1R axis, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) axis induces several beneficial physiologic effects ( Figure 1 ). Though once thought merely a systemic effector, components of the RAS [including ACE2 and Ang(1-7)] exist within a variety of tissues, most notably within the gastrointestinal tract. ACE2 mRNA and protein are present in significant amounts in small intestinal brush border, muscularis mucosa, and propria, as well as microvascular endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (3) . Additionally, the highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are found in the terminal ileum, duodenum, and colon (4, 5) ; thus making the gut an important target for altering RAS function.",

No females were used in this experiment because the colony at NIA is not currently supplying these animals (expected date is late in 2019 where we will repeat these experiments in females). This rat strain was chosen because of its increased longevity and decreased cumulative lesion incidence compared with other strains (11) . Animals (n = 29) were received at 24 months of age and housed individually on a 12 hours light and 12 hours dark cycle in a specific pathogen-free facility accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care at the University of Florida. Animals were fed a standard rodent chow (18% kcal from fat, no sucrose, 3.1 kcal/g, diet 2018; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Animals were allotted 1 week to acclimate to their housing conditions and to establish baseline rates of food intake and body weight. Health status, body weight, and food intake were monitored daily. Health assessments included checking for a sudden decline in body weight, redness around the eyes and nostrils, ruffled coat, open tail sores, and haunched posture. All experimental protocols were approved by the University of Florida's Animal Care and Use Committee, and in accordance with the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\" Design Rats (n = 6-8/group) were randomized at 24 months of age to the following treatment groups for 4 weeks: TAS vehicle or LP-A delivered 0\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 3\u00d7, or 7\u00d7/week. The concentration of the LP-A did not change, only the number of days/week that the LP-A was delivered. This range of doses were was chosen based on preliminary data from our laboratory indicating that LP-A given 3\u00d7/week was sufficient to raise Ang(1-7) in male F344BN rats by 25%, although this change was not statistically significant due to small numbers of animals (data not shown). To refine the dosing strategy, we chose a smaller (1\u00d7/week) and larger dose (7\u00d7/week). On days when rats in the 1\u00d7 and 3\u00d7/week group did not receive the LP-A, they were gavaged with PBS to control for the stress of being handling handled and gavaged to a similar degree as the 7\u00d7/week group. Animals were weighed and their food intake measured daily to ensure there were no anorectic or other adverse effects of the drug administration. On days 8 and 29, sublingual blood was drawn for analyses analysis of circulating RAS components. At the end of the 4 weeks, animals were euthanized by rapid decapitation, and tissues were dissected for future analyses.",

Briefly, the plasmid pTRKH3-ldhGFP (Addgene, plasmid #27170) was used as a backbone for construction of the expression vector in which the Ang-(1-7) peptide is expressed as a secreted fusion protein with the chorea toxin binding protein subunit B (CTB), separated by a furin cleavage site. Fusion with CTB facilitates the transmucosal transport into circulation and tissue uptake by GM1 receptor-mediated endocytosis. The resulting plasmid was electroporated into LP by electroporation as described by Welker et al. (12) . Wild Wild-type LP and LP-A were cultured in MRS (deMan Rogosa Sharpe) broth (BD Difco, Houston, TX) supplemented with 5 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes and re-suspended in sterile PBS for oral gavage. For extended storage, harvested bacteria were washed once with PBS and then suspended in TAS buffer (4% Trehalosetrehalose, 4% Sodium sodium Ascorbate ascorbate, and 6% skim milk) and frozen in small aliquots at \u221220\u00b0C. Colony counting was conducted before the animal experiments to ensure the numbers of surviving bacteria.",

The dose was optimized at 3\u00d7/week indicating that this is the most reasonable and efficacious regimen for future preclinical studies. Moreover, this effect was recapitulated when we compared Ang(1-7)/AngII across groups as well as in acute versus chronic administration. The impact on ACE2, ACE activity, and the ratio of the two was less dramatic. ACE2 was both acutely and chronically higher in the 3\u00d7 and 7\u00d7/week groups. ACE was higher in all dosing groups; however, only acutely. The ratio of the two was not changed at either time point. The reason for these secondary effects is not easily explainable, although it could be that we may have identified a positive feedback loop by which higher circulating Ang(1-7) modulates levels of these two enzymes. Whether these effects are specific to gut-delivered Ang(1-7) or if they are the result of specifically impacting circulating levels of Ang(1-7) remains an empirical question.

Indeed, the human intestinal tract (ie, \"gut\") is inhabited by over 100 trillion microorganisms, including over 1,000 species of known bacteria (16) . Commonly overlooked in human health and disease treatment, gut microorganisms encode > 150 times more genes than the human genome that impact host physiology and metabolism (17, 18) . Advanced age is associated with loss of diversity and number of gut microbiota leading to a \"leaky gut\" and increased systemic inflammation, reaching distal organs such as brain (19, 20) . Moreover, gut dysbiosis is tightly linked with the development of cognitive impairment (21,22), physical frailty (23, 24) , and Alzheimer's disease (25) . In support of this concept, we recently demonstrated that serum zonulin, a key physiologic regulator of intestinal permeability (26, 27) is elevated among healthy older adults compared to young adults (28) . Zonulin concentrations were also positively correlated with indices of inflammation and negatively correlated to strength and physical activity. These findings in humans indicate that a \"leaky gut\" could be a primary source of age-related inflammation, as in preclinical models (29) . Thus, the gut appears to be a key target for intervention to prevent, delay, or reverse aging and age-related disease.",

Moreover, evidence indicates that gut ACE2 is involved in regulating the ecology of the gut microbiome and attenuating intestinal inflammation suffered in response to epithelial damage (36) . In fact, ACE2 deficient-mice demonstrated increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation while transplantation of microbiota from these mice into germ-free, wild-type hosts induced colitis. As such, modulating the ACE2/Ang(1-7) axis appears to be a promising intervention for gut health.",
