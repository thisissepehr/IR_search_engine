The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PWP2 gene, identified by sequencing of chromosome III, is predicted to contain eight socalled WD-repeats, flanked by nonhomologous extensions. This gene is expressed as a 3.2-kb mRNA in all cell types and encodes a protein of 104 kDa. The PWP2 gene is essential for growth because spores carrying the pwp2 1 : : HIS3 disruption germinate before arresting growth with one or two large buds. The growth defect of pwp2 1 : : HIS3 cells was rescued by expression of PWP2 or epitope-tagged HA-PWP2 using the galactoseinducible GAL1 promoter. In the absence of galactose, depletion of Pwp2p resulted in multibudded cells with defects in bud site selection, cytokinesis, and hydrolysis of the septal junction between mother and daughter cells. In cell fractionation studies, HA-Pwp2p was localized in the particulate component of cell lysates, from which it would be solubulized by high salt and alkaline buffer but not by nonionic detergents or urea. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that HA-Pwp2p was clustered at multiple points in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Pwp2p exists in a proteinaceous complex, possibly associated with the cytoskeleton, where it functions in control of cell growth and separation.

Graphical self-comparison analysis (Maizel and Lenk 1981) revealed that Pwp2p contained internal repeats in the central region and at the C-terminus. The central repeats (Figs. 3, 4A ) correspond to eight copies of the WD motif that was first identified as a repeating unit in the -subunit of transducin (Fong et al. 1986 ). Five of these are full-length WD-repeats and three are ''incomplete'' half-repeats.

A statistical search for additional features of the predicted sequence using the SAPS algorithm (Brendel et al. 1992 ) revealed a high proportion of Asp residues (8.1% overall), particularly between amino acids 225-235 and near the C-terminus (Fig. 4A) . Such acidic clusters occur in less than 4% of proteins from yeast and humans (Sapolsky et al. 1993 ) and occur in several other WD-repeat proteins (Durino et al. 1992 ).

A Diploid yeast strains were transformed with restriction fragments containing the indicated pwp2 1 : : HIS3 deletion or pwp2-1 : : HIS3 insertion allele and His> transformants were selected. Sporulation and dissection of strains heterozygous for the P\u00bcP2 locus, yielded a 2 : 2 segregation of viability to non-viability. Shown are 18 tetrads from the diploid strain JRY182. The four spores of each tetrad were positioned vertically. All viable spores were His\\, indicating that P\u00bcP2 is an essential gene. B For Southern blotting analysis of the disrupted P\u00bcP2 gene, total cellular DNA was prepared from the wild-type diploid strain JRY182 (lane 1), the heterozygous insertion diploid strain RSY12 (P\u00bcP2/pwp2-1 : : HIS3 (lane 3), the heterozygous disruption diploid strain RSY15 (P\u00bcP2/pwp2 1 : : HIS3 ) (lanes 4 and 5), one of its haploid progeny (lane 2) and the haploid disruption strain RSY18 (pwp2 1 : : HIS3 carrying pRS10(YCplac22[P\u00bcP2]) (lanes 6). DNA was digested with EcoRI, transferred to the nylon membrane and hybridized with the radiolabelled 1.4-kb fragment of YCR57c. The resulting autoradiogram shows patterns of hybridization consistent with the DNA sequence: bands of 2.3-kb and 4.4-kb are derived from the intact P\u00bcP2 gene (lanes 1 and 2) ; insertion of the HIS3 gene in P\u00bcP2 produced an additional band of 8 kb (lanes 4, 5 and 6) and eliminated the 4.4-kb band (lane 6) Although an N-terminal signal sequence was not detected, a possible subcellular localization to the mitochondrial matrix was predicted by the PSORT program (Goffeau et al. 1993; Nakai and Kanehisa 1992) . Since the C-terminal region of Pwp2p had weakly repetitive character and a number of proteins related to neurofilaments have coiled-coil domains, the Pwp2p sequence was analysed with an algorithm to identify regions with heptad repeats (Lupas et al. 1991 ).

A deletion-disruption mutation was created (pwp2 1 : : HIS3) by replacing the 467-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment by the HIS3 gene.

The budding pattern of mother and daughter cells stained with Calcofluor was determined as described in Materials and methods and designated as ''axial'', ''polar'' or ''central''. Bud position was counted as the number of mothers with one bud scar and one bud that exhibited each pattern. The percentages of buds in the axial position in the combined results of three experiments are shown attached either in linear chains or (less commonly) in branched chains. This arrangement suggested that many cells grew buds at their poles, a pattern suggestive of the bipolar bud site selection exhibited by diploid cells. As judged by its ability to mate and to respond to -mating factor, however, RSY24 is a MA\u00b9a haploid strain. To analyze the pattern of bud site selection in RSY24 cells, the location of buds in mother cell containing one bud and one bud scar (4-12% of the population) was determined after staining with Calcofluor to identify the bud scar. Such cells were classified as exhibiting either an axial, central, or polar budding pattern. In galactose-grown RSY24 cells, most mother cells (70%) had budded adjacent to the scar (axial), 19% budded near the scar (central) and 11% budded at the opposite pole (polar). Control cells (SP1) wild-type for P\u00bcP2, as well as SP1 cells carrying pRS18 (RSY39), which overexpress P\u00bcP2 mRNA when grown in galactose medium, exhibited a similar, predominantly axial budding pattern. In contrast, 18 h after shifting RSY24 cells to glucose medium, the majority of such mothers had formed buds at the opposite pole (51%) and relatively fewer had budded at sites either axial (23%) or central (26%) to the bud scar (Fig. 9 ). In agreement with these observations, in glucose-cultured RSY24 cells with two large buds, 14% of the buds were adjacent, 12% were central, and 74% had buds at opposite poles. Thus, mother cells wildtype for P\u00bcP2, exhibited a predominantly axial pattern of bud site selection, whereas the majority of mother cells with reduced expression of P\u00bcP2 had budded at the opposite pole. Since SP1 control cells cultured in glucose medium showed a surprisingly high frequency of polar budding (23%), the analysis of bud site selection was repeated in isogenic strains from a different genetic background (RAY3A). In glucose-grown RAY3A haploid cells, nearly all mothers with one bud and a single bud scar had budded adjacent to the scar (97%), whereas 12 h after shifting RSY41 cells to glucose medium such mothers exhibited a random pattern and formed buds at either polar (31%), axial (40%), or central (29%) sites (Fig. 9) .

As a control for cell lysis and fractionation, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was found enriched in the S100 fraction in these experiments. To determine the nature of the association of HA-Pwp2p with the particulate cell fraction, cell lysates were pretreated with various reagents for 20 min prior to centrifugation at 100 000;g and subsequent Western blot analysis. The results of this experiment (Fig. 11B) indicate that Pwp2p was partially solubilized by pretreatment with 0.1 M Na CO (pH 11) or 0.5 M NaCl at room temperature, but was unaffected by treatment with lysis buffer, 1% Triton X-100 or 2 M urea. These results indicate that the strong associations between Pwp2p and insoluble components involve electrostatic and pH-sensitive forces rather than simple hydrophobic interactions. Together with the Fig. 11A , B Subcellular fractionation of HA-P\u00bcP2. A Extracts from RSY54 cells were prepared and fractionated by differential centrifugation as described in Materials and methods. Equivalent volumes of total lysate, P10, P100 and the corresponding supernatant (S100) prepared from approximately 10 cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with 12CA5 antibody. The 104-kDa HA-Pwp2p band from each fraction is shown. B Cell lysates were separated into pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions by centrifugation at 100 000;g after treatment with lysis buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 2 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl or 0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 11).

This protein (Pwp2p) is predicted to have an N-terminal extension preceding a central region with eight WD-repeats that share homology with the G protein -transducin, followed by possible coiled-coil structures at the C-terminal region. The present work shows that Pwp2p is part of an insoluble complex located at multiple points in the cytoplasm, where it is involved in regulation of processes that are essential for growth, cytokinesis, and cell separation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 227, "text": "(Oliver et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previously known WD proteins have been found in a variety of cellular locations, where they are involved in diverse processes including cell cycle regulation, transcription regulation, signal transduction and RNA splicing. Most of then seem to have a regulatory function and many are known to exist in large protein complexes (Neer et al. 1993) . Another structure predicted to be present in Pwp2p, the coiled-coil domain, is also found in proteins that exist in complexes. Coiledcoil domains have been found in filament-forming proteins, G protein -subunits, and in the dimerization domains of several transcriptional regulatory proteins (Lupas et al. 1991) . These observations raise the possibility that Pwp2p may exist as part of a multiprotein complex, possibly interacting with other proteins through the coiled-coil and WD-repeat regions. This idea is supported by the results of subcellular localization studies. Indirect immunofluorescence methods using biologically active HA-tagged Pwp2p, revealed a number of small, brightly staining structures throughout the cytoplasm, which did not coincide with the nucleus, mitochrondia or plasma membrane. The multidot pattern did not change significantly during the cell cycle or upon overproduction of P\u00bcP2. Despite its hydrophilic, charged character, Pwp2p was found to be strongly associated with the insoluble fraction of the cell. Even after repeated differential centrifugation steps, the particles were found equally in the P10 and the P100 fractions, indicating that they do not have a uniform size or density. Based on several observations, we conclude that these particles are unlikely to be associated with large organelles like mitochondria, nuclei, vacuoles or large membrane structures of the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. The fact that reagents known to perturb protein-protein interactions, such as alkaline buffer and high salt were able partially to solubilize Pwp2p suggests that Pwp2p is part of a protein complex. The finding that the association between Pwp2p and the insoluble fraction is completely resistant to treatment with Triton X-100 is suggestive of cytoskeletal associations, which, in yeast as in other eukaryotic cells, remain intact following extraction with nonionic detergents (Branton et al. 1981; Herman and Emr 1990) . Our localization and fractionation evidence indicates, therefore, that Pwp2p is not associated with membrane vesicles but rather forms part of a proteinaceous complex, potentially including cytoskeletal elements of the cell. Further biochemical experiments are necessary to determine the precise nature of the association of Pwp2p with this insoluble complex. In an effort to identify the specific components that interact with Pwp2p in vivo, we have initiated a search for genes that suppress pwp2 ts mutants in multiple copies and we have identified peptides that interact with Pwp2p in the two-hybrid system.

The P\u00bcP2 gene is expressed in all cell types and is essential for growth.

A similar phenotype was observed in detail following down-regulation of P\u00bcP2 gene expression with the GA\u00b81 promoter. Cell separation is severely defective and cannot easily be accomplished by micromanipulation or sonication. Bud site selection is also abnormal and follows a random pattern, in contrast to the axial pattern typical of haploid wild-type cells. Although some of the buds are elongated, which suggest that bud growth is overpolarized, the formation of actin cytoskeletal elements and the chitin ring at the base of the bud appear to be unaffected.
