To the best of our knowledge, there is only one report of ECMO use in HIV infected patient [5] .

Also, our patient may have had an early stage of HIV infection as witnessed by a high HIV-1 viral load in parallel with a weak antibody band spectrum on Western Blot analysis and relatively rapid CD4 count recovery. Importantly, our patient had a predominant pulmonary failure while the function of other organs was relatively preserved making veno-venous ECMO a good choice of gas-exchange support while anti-infective therapy took effect. Also, we chose an aggressive preemptive approach to diagnose and treat nosocomial superinfections. Increased cardiac output, leaky capillaries, enlarged volume of distribution and impaired tissue penetration in septic patients may lead to an inadequate concentration of antimicrobial agent at the target site [10] . Also, due to sequestration and increased volume of distribution patients on ECMO are at risk of suboptimal antimicrobial therapy [11] . Therefore, there is a tendency to use higher doses of antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients.
