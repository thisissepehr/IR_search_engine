The NDV AGP test was found to be a simple, inexpensive, and practical procedure for detecting serum antibody. The test was used to assess NDV vaccination and infection of chickens. The AGP procedure can be used to identify flocks with low levels of NDV serum antibody or demonstrate an increase in the number of AGP positive chickens by testing paired serum samples collected before and after natural NDV infection or vaccination. Suspicious or questionable AGP test results could then be re-evaluated quantitatively using the HI, VN, or ELISA procedure. Applications of the AGP test to other species of domestic poultry and wild birds may also be possible.
