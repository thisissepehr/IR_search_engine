However adaptive pressure eventually leads to changes in phenotype that involve non-neutral mutations. The relation between neutrality and adaptation has been studied in the context of RNA before and here we further study transitional mutations in the context of degenerate (plastic) RNA sequences and genetic assimilation. We propose quasineutral mutations, i.e. mutations which preserve an element of the phenotype set, as minimal mutations and study their properties. We also propose a general probabilistic interpretation of genetic assimilation and specialize it to the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA sequences. Results: We show that degenerate sequences i.e. sequences with more than one structure at the MFE level have the highest evolvability among all sequences and are central to evolutionary innovation. Degenerate sequences also tend to cluster together in the sequence space. The selective pressure in an evolutionary simulation causes the population to move towards regions with more degenerate sequences, i.e. regions at the intersection of different neutral networks, and this causes the number of such sequences to increase well beyond the average percentage of degenerate sequences in the sequence space. We also observe that evolution by quasineutral mutations tends to conserve the number of base pairs in structures and thereby maintains structural integrity even in the presence of pressure to the contrary. Conclusions: We conclude that degenerate RNA sequences play a major role in evolutionary adaptation.",

According to this theory, evolution is driven by neutral mutations and it is the accumulation of such mutations which results in the occurrence of beneficial mutations. This is in contrast with the selectionist view of evolution in which most mutations are either deleterious of beneficial. Neutral networks imply robustness for RNA phenotypes under mutations while at the same time increasing the number of other phenotypes to which one can evolve. Mutational robustness means that, due to the significant number of neutral neighbors for most sequences, RNA phenotypes are resilient under mutations of their underlying phenotypes. Therefore starting from a sequence in a neutral network and randomly mutating it, its structure stays the same for a period of time, as long as the mutations are neutral.",

To quantify these phenomena one defines the mutational robustness of a sequence to be the fraction of its one point mutants that fold into the same structure. Sequences of high robustness lie in the \"interior\" of a neutral network while those of low neutrality lie closer to its interface with other networks.

He termed such a distribution a quasispecies. Around the same time as the publication of the quasispecies theory, Gillespie [18] proposed an algorithm for the probabilistic simulation of the interactions between molecular species in a flow reactor. Even though the physics behind molecular interactions in chemistry and mutations and natural selection in biology may be very different, Gillespie's approach can be applied to studying both [19] . Gillespie's method was adopted by Fontana and Schuster [19] for simulating RNA evolution. Such a simulation starts with a population of RNA sequences that are chosen at random. At each step a member of the population is chosen randomly to replicate. As in actual replication in cells there is a probability, called the error rate that a base is changed (mutated) during replication, resulting in a mutant copy of the original sequence. One uses a fitness function to decide which members are given more chance to replicate. Fontana and Schuster use three different fitness functions: the structure distance to a given natural structure [20] , minimum free energy and a sigmoid function derived from the number of helices and the number of their arcs in the structure [19] .",

Phenotypic plasticity is when different environmental conditions result in the association of more than one phenotype to a given genotype. It exists in biological as well as molecular species [22] and is believed to have a major role in evolutionary diversification [23] . Structural promiscuity is a closely related phenomenon in which a genotype, such as an enzyme, exhibits more than one function. However, unlike phenotypic plasticity, no change in the environment is needed for the extra, \"promiscuous\", functions to exhibit themselves [24] . Sequence length Fraction of degenerate sequences Fig. 1 The percentage of degenerate sequences as a function of sequence length. 10 5 random sequences of each length were used to obtain this data. The percentage of degenerate sequences is nearly a parabolic function of chain length. As sequence length increases to near 1000 almost all sequences become degenerate Phenotypic plasticity results in a mode of evolution called genetic assimilation (often confused with the Baldwin effect [25] ). Genetic assimilation was defined by Conrad Waddington as a process \"by which a phenotypic character, which initially is produced only in response to some environmental influence, becomes, through a process of selection, taken over by the genotype, so that it is formed even in the absence of the environmental influence which had at first been necessary\" [25] .",

There is also a qualitative description of assimilation using dynamical (\"layered\") genotype networks [27, 28] . Here, inspired by the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA (discussed below), we give a probabilistic interpretation of assimilation and then specialize it to RNA molecules. We postulate that all the phenotypes that a genotype can possibly have via either structural promiscuity or phenotypic plasticity belong to the abstract phenotype space of that genotype. For a fixed environmental condition, each element of the phenotype space has a specific probability of occurrence, with the most fit (wild type) being the most probable. However changes in the environment alter these probabilities. Such changes can either keep the wild type fixed (neutrality) or cause it to be replaced with another phenotype. However even in the former case, the probabilities of suboptimal (promiscuous) phenotypes can change. Note that the idea of a probabilistic phenotype space is somewhat similar to phenotype-genotype correlation analysis in medicine, see e.g. [29] .",

Under normal circumstances the unusual cross-veinless phenotype exists in the phenotype space of drosophila with a small probability. The heat shock results in the probability of this phenotype to increase while still keeping the wild type fixed. However after a few generations the change in the environment results in a neutral evolution of the genotype to one in which both the wild type and the cross-veinless have similar probabilities. (Neutrality in the context of genetic assimilation has been discussed before, as cryptic genetic variation [30] . ) We call a genotype with more than one most probable (wild type) phenotype, degenerate. (This terminology is somewhat different from the use of this word in biology literature.) Since in the intermediate stage of genetic assimilation a genotype (or, in our interpretation, a population of neutral genotypes) exhibits more than one wild-type phenotype, this genotype is bound to be degenerate or at least nearly degenerate in the given environment.",

Examples of (nearly) degenerate RNAs include: Riboswitches, Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA [36] and the untranslated leader RNA of HIV-1 virus [37] . See also Fig. 3 . Degenerate sequences have high evolvability and tend to cluster together in the sequence space, see Figs. 4 and 5. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , the percentage of sequences which are degenerate increases as a function of the length of the chain so that for length 1000 and longer almost all sequences are degenerate. Degenerate RNA sequences were computationally studied in [38] . In [38] we also studied quasineutrality which is intimately related to our interpretation of genetic assimilation in the case of RNA. Two sequences are quasineutral if they have a phenotype (MFE structure) in common and similarly a mutation relating two such sequences is called a quasineutral mutation. Such a mutation is nontrivial (non-neutral) only if one of the two sequences is degenerate. In [38] we observed that quasineutral walks i.e. walks in the sequence space in which each new sequence is a quasineutral mutant of the last, resemble neutral walks in the short run and random walks in the long run. Such walks were able to reach their targets solely by means of genetic assimilation (see also the \"Results\" section on quasineutral simulations). This result provides computational evidence for the genetic assimilation theory in the context of RNA evolution.",

The structure of the 5' end of this mRNA, of length 58, is important in the regulation of translation of the associated gene [39] . In [39, 40] it is demonstrated that this mRNA posesses two different conformations (structures) referred to as A and B, see Fig. 3 . When the Fig. 2 The two stable folded structures of the degenerate cIII mRNA belonging to the bacteriophage \u03bb [39] . The left and the right structures have free energies are computed to be \u2212 19.6 kc/mol and \u221218.1 kc/mol respectively [39] . The difference in the free energies may be due to ignoring tertiary bonds by the energy model [39] Fig. 3 A schematic depiction of genetic assimilation through degeneracy for RNA. The vertical lines represent the energy scale in the Boltzmann ensemble of individual sequences. This means that the higher up a structure is, the higher its free energy and therefore the lower its Boltzmann probability. Thus the lowest structure is the MFE structure of the sequence. The label N S denotes the neutral network of S. A nondegenerate RNA sequence (left) which has structure S at MFE level is forced by selective pressure to neutrally (cryptically) evolve into a degenerate sequence folding to two RNA structures S, S (center). Further selection causes the sequence to enter the neutral network of S and discard its original phenotype S. This way the acquired phenotypic character S becomes inherent to the genotype environment temperature is increased the ratio of the two structures is shifted towards A. The authers analyse the one point mutants of this mRNA and realize that in mutants which resulted in overexpression, structure B predominates, whereas in most of the low-expression mutants, A is favored. This is because in structure B, the Shine-Dalgarno-AUG region is unpaired and, hence, more accessible for ribosome binding, whereas it is occluded in structure A. Some of these mutants have the same MFEstructure as the natural sequence and so can be regarded as being quasineutral to it.",

They conclude that such a \"plastic fitness function\" results in the vanishing of plasticity in the population and prevents it from reaching its target.

It is most likely for a sequence of degeneracy 2,3,4 or 6 to have a neighbor of the same degeneracy while for degeneracy 5, 7 (and higher odd numbers) it's most likely to have a non-degenerate neighbor. We see that neighbors of degenerate sequences are far more likely to be degenerate compared to neighbors of nondegenerate sequences.

In quasineutral non-adaptive runs the size of the pool of the dominant structure is much larger than in free non-adaptive runs: an average of 890 sequences for the quasineutral run as opposed to 82 for the free run.",

This might be attributed the to fitness function f S (see \"Methods\" section) that uses the minimum distance to the target of all the structures in the MFEset of a sequence, thereby giving an implicit advantage to degenerate sequences. However as we saw in the \"Results\" section, the rise in the number of degenerate sequences happens even in free simulations with the fitness function f s which uses only one MFE-structure per sequence, i.e. the one chosen by the Vienna RNA package. This implies that such a rise is an intrinsic property of the simulations, even of the simulations performed in [20] , and indicates that degenerate sequences play a major role in adaptation.

Some insight is provided by comparing the probability distributions \u03c1 and \u03c1 * (see Methods\" section) for structures to which the inverse folds of Phenylalanine are likely to mutate, see Fig. 9 .

To demonstrate this, we ran simulations in which the base pair distance was used to measure the distance of structures to the target. The base pair distance between two structures S and S is given by the number of base pairs present in S 1 but not in S 2 plus the number of ones present in S 2 but not in S 1 . So one can expect that in a simulation using this metric, the series of dominant structures connecting the initial structure S 0 to the target S T is given by removing the arcs that are in S 0 and not in S T and adding the arcs that are in S T and not in S 0 . We observe that this is indeed the case and in 18.5% of the 10 3 free simulations using base pair distance, the average MFE of the population drops to zero, i.e. the open chain becomes dominant. However the quasineutral runs even with base pair distance avoided this phenomenon. This can be attributed to the fact that quasineutral mutations tend to maintain the number of base pairs, see Fig. 10 . Quasineutral mutations thus preserve the integrity of the structures involved even when there is a strong pressure to reduce the number of base pairs.",

Tree edit distance is widely used for Rank Probability Fig. 9 The probabilities \u03c1 (black) and \u03c1 * (blue) for structure neighbors of Phenylalanine. Fifty thousand inverse folds of Phenylalanine were used to compute these probabilities. Both axes are scaled logarithmically. The rank 1 structure, the structure into which Phenylalanine is most likely to mutate, either freely (black curve) or quasineutrally (blue curve) is the same for the two curves. However the probability to mutate quasineutrally to this structure, \u03c1 * , is 29 times higher than its free probability \u03c1. This explains why in free simulations, at the time of a transition the population splits between different neutral networks, whereas for quasineutral ones the transition is rapid and without much splitting Change in the number of arcs probability Fig. 10 Changing the number of arcs by free (black curve) and quasineutral (blue curve) mutations. Top: Probabilities \u03c1 and \u03c1 * are computed for 100 randomly selected MFE structures and the average of \u03c1(S, S ) (respectively \u03c1 * (S, S )) is obtained restricted to the condition that S, S differ by a given number of arcs. We observe that even though neutral mutations are excluded from the computation of both \u03c1 and \u03c1 , quasineutral mutations have a much higher likelihood of preserving the number of arcs. The probability of a positive (resp. negative) change in the number of arcs for free mutations is 0.5 (resp. 0.35) and for quasineutral mutations it is 0.46 (resp. 0.28). This means that quasineutral mutations are slightly less likely to decrease the number of arcs. Bottom: The same probabilities for structures S with 4 or 5 arcs. We see that when the number of arcs is low, quasineutral simulations are less likely to decrease the number of arcs and so to result in the structure to mutate to an open chain comparing secondary structures such as in the simulations done by Fontana and Schuster. However it is slow to compute as one needs to find the shortest edit path connecting the trees associated to the two structures. According to [45] d WM and the tree-edit distance exhibit similar distributions of (normalized) distances between random structures. Therefore d WM represents a suitable alternative to the tree-edit distance when comparing a large number of secondary structures.",

The blue bars depict the distribution for all the 10 5 inverse folds and the yellow bars show the degenerate sequences. We observe that as degenerate sequences lie at the intersection of two (ore more) quasineutral networks, they tend to have higher evolvabilities: the mean evolvability of all the inverse folds is 111 while that of degenerate inverse folds is 143. Additionally most high-evolvability sequences are degenerate. The highest evolvability for our sample was 495. The inset shows the distribution of single-MFE evolvability, see Methods for details",
