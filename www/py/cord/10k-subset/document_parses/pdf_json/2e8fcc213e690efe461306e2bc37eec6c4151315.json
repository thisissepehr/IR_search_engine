Although rhinovirus appears to occasionally cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients, the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract remains unknown. We evaluated 697 recipients transplanted between 1993 and 2015 with rhinovirus in respiratory samples. As comparative cohorts, 273 recipients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (N=117), parainfluenza virus (N=120), or influenza (N=36) were analyzed. Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Among 569 subjects with rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection and 128 subjects with rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection, probabilities of overall mortality at 90 days were 6% and 41%, respectively (P<0.001). The survival rate after lower respiratory tract infection was not affected by the presence of copathogens (55% in patients with co-pathogens, 64% in patients without, P=0.34). Low monocyte count (P=0.027), oxygen use (P=0.015), and steroid dose greater than 1 mg/kg/day (P=0.003) before diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality among patients with lower respiratory tract infection in multivariable analysis. Mortality after rhinovirus lower respiratory tract infection was similar to that after lower respiratory tract infection by respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or influenza in an adjusted model. In summary, transplant recipients with rhinovirus detection in the lower respiratory tract had high mortality rates comparable to viral pneumonia associated with other well-established respiratory viruses.

While the comparison of mortality after URI and LRI alone is not conclusive evidence for a causative effect of HRV for LRI, the two curves are significantly difhaematologica | 2017; 102(6) A C B ferent, and in addition, look remarkably similar to curves previously documented for other respiratory viruses, such as PIV, in HCT recipients. 15 Second, the fact that mortality in patients with or without co-pathogens is similar could suggest that HRV by itself is a cause of LRI, because otherwise one would expect the outcome to be improved in patients without co-pathogens. Next, factors associated with mortality following HRV BAL positivity were similar to those for other respiratory viruses (RSV, PIV, HMPV, influenza viruses) reported by our group and others, [14] [15] [16] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and included oxygen use, cytopenias, and high-dose corti-costeroid use (Tables 2 and 4 ). An important analysis was the comparison of the outcome of HRV LRI with other well-established viral pneumonias. We used 3 previously described cohorts [14] [15] [16] and analyzed overall mortality in a multivariable Cox model that adjusted for key factors that are associated with poor outcome. There was no difference in mortality after LRI between HRV and the other 3 viruses, even after adjusting for several important factors, such as the presence of co-pathogens and oxygen use at the time of diagnosis (Table 6, Figure 2 ), providing strong evidence that HRV detection in the BAL is indeed a clini- cally significant finding. Although the Cox model adjusted for oxygen use, we performed a subset analysis of patients who presented without oxygen use ( Figure 2B ). This group likely had minimal or no acute lung injury at the time of diagnosis and the subsequent outcome in these patients was more likely to be associated with the viral insult rather than the inflammatory changes associated with acute lung injury. Although mortality was, as expected, lower in this group, mortality rates approaching 20% by 3 months after diagnosis were documented, indicating an important negative impact on survival. Importantly, there were no apparent differences in LRI outcomes between HRV and RSV, PIV or influenza virus. We also examined virologic factors to evaluate the role of HRV in lung disease. Tissue documentation of a pathogen is considered a key factor supporting a pathogenic role of an infectious agent. 24, 25 Although we were limited by the small number of tissue samples from lung biopsies and autopsies in our cohort, we were able to culture HRV from lung biopsies in 6 of 22 patients who had S. Seo et al. 1128 haematologica | 2017; 102(6) cultures performed. This is a remarkable result because our culture system is not optimized for HRV recovery (which in general is improved by incubation at lower temperatures and other methods, such as roller flasks, as used in previous papers), 7 and suggests a high viral load may have been present. Since viral culture positivity from biopsy material is generally considered to indicate invasive viral disease for other respiratory viruses and cytomegalovirus (CMV), 24, 26, 27 we consider this finding to be highly significant. We also detected HRV RNA by PCR in archived frozen tissue from lung biopsies and autopsy samples. The HRV PCR Ct values of the BAL samples, which provide a rough estimate of the HRV viral load, were not associated with mortality in our cohort (Tables 2  and 4 ). The lack of association does not rule out a pathogenic role of HRV, since studies with other well-established pathogens such as CMV, RSV, and PIV also failed to demonstrate an association of viral load in the BAL with mortality. 12, 15, 28, 29 Methodologic issues may be responsible for these results, including the inability to account for BAL dilution and the potentially differential amplification efficiency of different HRV serotypes. 30 Additional studies are needed to conclusively study the role of the viral load in the BAL for HRV and other viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 451, "end": 453, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 877, "end": 881, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 882, "end": 886, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 887, "end": 891, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 897, "end": 901, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 912, "end": 916, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1163, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1168, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1173, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2522, "end": 2525, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2528, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2729, "end": 2733, "text": "1128", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3009, "end": 3010, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3233, "end": 3236, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3237, "end": 3240, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3241, "end": 3243, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3787, "end": 3790, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3791, "end": 3794, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3795, "end": 3798, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3799, "end": 3801, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3998, "end": 4000, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 109, "text": "Figure 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 988, "end": 1003, "text": "(Tables 2 and 4", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1534, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1775, "text": "Figure 2B", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3538, "end": 3554, "text": "(Tables 2  and 4", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The study herein has both strengths and limitations. We examined a large number of cases of HRV RNA positive BALs and comparative cases with other viral lower respiratory diseases which allowed us to perform appropriate statistical analyses that carefully accounted for copathogens and stages of acute lung injury. Our study was not restricted to specific transplant types or time periods after HCT, however, a subgroup analysis of recent allogeneic transplant recipients showed similar results. Due to a lack of specific information about the severity of GvHD in some cases, the association between mortality after HRV LRI and GvHD remains unclear, although we used steroid dose as a surrogate marker for GvHD severity. Our largely unbiased approach of evaluating patients with pulmonary infiltrates by bronchoscopy and BAL and the availability of lung tissue are additional strengths. According to previous reports, approximately 30% of HRV URI cases were asymptomatic 4 and 5% of BAL sam-ples from asymptomatic HCT recipients included HRV LRI; 12 we therefore think that asymptomatic lower respiratory tract infection is only a minor factor in the present study. Other limitations include the lack of tissue immunohistochemical studies and the lack of direct viral quantitation, as well as our inability to adequately culture for HRV in autopsy or biopsy specimens. Currently available antibodies for HRV are serotype-specific. 31 Because we did not identify the HRV serotypes in our tissue samples, we could not perform immunohistochemistry to confirm tissue detection of HRV.
