Recent reports suggest that the analysis of circulating levels of SP-D is useful as a diagnostic tool in severe sepsis patients with ARDS [22] and to evaluate the progression of lung injury in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation in whom circulating levels of this protein positively correlates with the lung injury score as a parameter to measure the pathophysiological features of ARDS [23] In this scenario, clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the increased plasma SP-D levels could reflect acute alveolar damage and type II cell hyperplasia [24, 25] .
