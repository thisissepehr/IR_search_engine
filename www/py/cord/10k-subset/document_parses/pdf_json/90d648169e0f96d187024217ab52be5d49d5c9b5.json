Filled CRFs were later validated and the missing data completed. We also followed up patients for 90-day hospital outcome. Results: We screened 423 patients (ED n=38, Wards n=318, ICU n=72). Twentyone percent of the patients were on O 2 , with the highest prevalence in the ICU (42, 58%). The most common reason for O 2 use was congestive heart failure (19%) followed by pre/post-operative order, neurological conditions and pulmonary diseases. The most commonly used device was nasal prongs (54%) followed by invasive mechanical ventilators (26%). The number of patients requiring urgent consultation from the critical-care response team was only 4 out of 90 and the number of patients developing new ARDS within 7 days was 2 out of 90. At day 90, 12% of the patients had died in the hospital and 9% was still admitted. Hyper-oxygenation was common, affecting 42% of the patients. The prevalence was higher in the ICU (52% VS 37% in the wards). The median [IQR] of SpO 2 for overall patients was 97% [94-99%]. The devices causing high incidence of hyperoxygenation were tracheostomy mask (4/4), followed by mechanical ventilators (17/23; 74%) . There was no statistically significant difference between the FiO 2 set on the ventilators for those who were hyper-oxygenated and normo-oxygenated (0.40 [0.38-0.50] VS 0.40 [0.34-0.46] respectively). A secondary chart analysis indicated that ICU patients who were labelled as hyper-oxygenated spent 80% of the 24h hyper-oxygenated. Conclusion: Hyper-oxygenation is a common problem in patients receiving O 2 . The prevalence is higher in the ICU despite having more rigorous monitoring. Instability of the patients with fluctuation of the SpO 2 may influence the clinicians' decision to set higher target of SpO 2 to be on the safe side. The next phase of WHARF study will use a questionnaire to explore attitudes and decision makings of the clinicians facing various case scenario regarding O 2 management. Introduction: Patient eligibility for research in the intensive care unit (ICU) can occur at any time of day or week. Deferred consent, consent from the patient or substitute decision-maker (SDM) after research has commenced, is a common alteration in the ICU when conducting observational research or studying low risk, time-sensitive interventions or transient phenomenon (1) . Utilization of a deferred approach can overcome challenges experienced as a result of patient incapacity and SDM availability. SDMs and patients have endorsed deferred consent as an acceptable mechanism for research consent in the ICU (2, 3) . Herein we describe time to deferred consent from SDMs in an observational study of diaphragm activity in mechanically ventilated patients. Objectives: To describe consent outcomes, including timing, in an observational study of diaphragm activity in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. Methods: DIVIP, Assessing Diaphragm Muscle Inactivity in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients, is an observational study which involves serial recording of electrical activity of the diaphragm and daily diaphragm ultrasound (NCT02434016) for up to 5 days. The first ultrasound must be performed within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. The Research Ethics Board at St. Michael's Hospital approved the use of a deferred consent model for patient enrollment in the study and for the conduct of the first ultrasound. The research team has up to 5 days after enrollment to assess the patient for capacity and/or identify and contact an SDM (in-person or by phone) for consent for continued participation and the completion of up to 5 ultrasounds. Data from our local screening log was reviewed to identify outcomes and timing of our deferred consent approach. Results: From April 2016 to the end of July 2017, we enrolled 29 patients into the study. Deferred consent was obtained from SDMs in 15 patients (52%). Most consents (11/15 ; 73%) occurred within 24 hours, allowing us to obtain the maximum number of ultrasounds in these patients. Consent for continued participation could not be obtained for 14 patients with the most common cause being no identifiable SDM (6/14; 43%), followed by patient extubation prior to consent (29%). In only one patient was the absence of consent the result of a designated SDM not being reachable within the 5-day study window. Considering all patients with an identified SDM, consent rates of 81% (13/16) and 94% (15/16) were possible with time windows of 48 hours and 5 days respectively.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1285, "end": 1297, "text": "(17/23; 74%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2483, "end": 2486, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2724, "end": 2727, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2730, "text": "3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4052, "end": 4058, "text": "(11/15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A deferred consent model supported patient enrollment in our observational study.

Despite advances in our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, specific therapies are still lacking. Passive exercise is one potential therapy that may improve survival and long-term outcomes via the modulation of skeletal muscle blood flow (1) and distal organ perfusion (2) . However, the effect of passive exercise on organ perfusion in septic patients has never been measured. Furthermore, the dose of passive exercise required to affect distal organ perfusion will likely vary among septic patients given the heterogeneity of their baseline comorbidities, exercise tolerance, and illness severity. We developed a model of graded passive exercise that can be used to study global hemodynamics, brain and heart perfusion in septic patients, and tested its feasibility and safety in a cohort of healthy adults. Objectives: To assess the effect of a graded passive exercise model on global hemodynamics, cerebral blood flow and cardiac function in a cohort of healthy volunteers, and to test the feasibility and safety of this model prior to its application in septic patients. Methods: We passively exercised 11 healthy volunteers using an in-bed cycle ergometer. After collecting resting baseline data, we increased the ergometer cadence from 5 rotations per minute (RPM) to 55 RPM in 10 RPM intervals each lasting 5 minutes. During each interval, we recorded continuous global hemodynamics and cerebral blood flow using the Finapres\u00ae NOVA and transcranial doppler (TCD), respectively. We also measured regional and global left ventricular (LV) function at each cadence level using speckle tracking analysis, a sensitive technique to detect changes in regional and global LV contractility. Results: Graded passive exercise has no effect on global hemodynamics, except for a 7% increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). There were no changes in cerebral blood flow or cardiac function. The graded passive exercise model was well tolerated by all participants. Conclusion: In healthy adults, our model of graded passive exercise is feasible, safe and has no clinically significant impact on global hemodynamics, cerebral blood flow or cardiac function. This model can now be safely applied to septic patients.

The NPRC is responsible for supporting CCCTG members in 4 key domains including a) core documentation resources; b) research support; c) research training and mentoring; and d) patient and family engagement in critical care. Objective: We sought to evaluate the relative importance of activities in these 4 domains to the members of the CCCTG. This assessment will provide insight to the NPRC and the CCCTG regarding how best to support the learning needs of the multi-professional CCCTG members. Methods: We developed a 14 item questionnaire to rate the importance of key academic activities within the aforementioned 4 domains on a scale from 1 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). We provided participants the opportunity to comment on additional activities not included in the questionnaire. We collected respondents' demographic data including professional affiliation(s), role within the CCCTG, and length of time in that role. Before administering the questionnaire, we pilot tested it with 6 CCCTG members and assessed its clinical sensibility. Along with the electronic version distributed via SurveyMonkey\u00ae, we administered a paper version of the questionnaire at the 2017 Winter CCCTG scientific meeting. All responses were anonymous and questionnaire completion was voluntary. The need for a full Research Ethics Board (REB) application was waived by the Hamilton Health Sciences REB. Results: From January 2017 to July 2017, the questionnaire was distributed to 458 CCCTG members. 141 (30.8%) CCCTG members completed the questionnaire. Of the 141 respondents, 47.5% were MDs, 39.7% RCs, and 12.8% other allied health care professionals. Approximately one third of the respondents were in the first five years of their profession (38.3%) and another third for more than 15 years (31.9%).

Some will require unplanned ICU care. The characteristics and outcomes of these patients are sometimes not well defined to treating ICU physicians, leading to inconsistent prognostication and therapeutic decisions. Some of these patients are allowed to receive advanced care despite poor prognosis leading to futile treatment and eventual mortality. However, outcome of ICU care in cancer patients have improved, which calls for a more refined triaging of cancer patients to ICU. Studies that describe the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients is lacking in our population. Objectives: To describe the characteristics of patients with hematological and solid cancers who require ICU admission and to review their outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively collected data from patients with hematological and solid cancers admitted to a large academic ICU unit over a six year period (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) . We excluded patients admitted electively for elective post-oncological surgery care. Logistic regression analyses will be conducted to examine the association between ICU mortality and the following covariates: Age, ICU length of stay (LOS), APACHE score, prior cancer therapy within three months, need of mechanical ventilation (MV), need of renal replacement therapy (RRT), and presence of febrile neutropenia.

Results: There were a total of 473 admissions to ICU of patients with cancer. 221 admissions were hematological malignancies and 252 admissions were those with solid tumours. Average LOS in ICU was 9.9 days. Mean age was 51.2 years, whereas mean APACHE scores were 22.4 for hematological and 21.4 for solid tumours. 33.4% of patients had received cancer therapy within 3 months. 74.3% needed MV, and 15% needed RRT. 26 .8% were admitted with febrile neutropenia. Overall survival was 40.4% at 30 days, with 37.1% of hematological and 43.3% of solid tumour patients surviving 30 days. Survival decreases at 90 days to 25.6% overall, with similar numbers for hematological and solid tumours (26.2 and 25% respectively). Conclusion: Outcome of ICU patients with cancer is worse than the average ICU patient but these patients should not be denied ICU aggressive therapy solely based on their cancer status. More refined prognostication models should be constructed to help clinicians caring for oncology patients determine the utility of ICU admission once a need arises. Introduction: Critical care medicine is expensive. It is estimated that almost 1% of the gross domestic product is spent on critical care alone. 1 Additionally, intensive care unit (ICU) costs are expected to rise as usage escalates due to an aging population and the increasing severity of illness among hospitalized patients. 2, 3 It has been well described in the literature that a small proportion patients account for a disproportionate amount of health care spending. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Longitudinal data has shown that only a minority of these patients remain in the high-cost group over time, 15, 22 rendering reactive strategies less useful. Identifying these patients up front may present an opportunity for focused intervention to reduce spending, albeit there is a paucity of literature describing these patients in the ICU setting. To date, we are only aware of a single retrospective study reported in the ICU literature. 11 A better understanding of the cost pattern predictors may help anticipate resource demands and provide an opportunity to mitigate costs. Objectives: To describe the characteristics, cost patterns, and outcomes for highcost patients in the ICU. Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study conducted at two medical/surgical ICUs in a tertiary care academic centre. Included patients were critically ill admissions aged 18 years or older. This was a cost comparison study. Patients were divided into cost groups with the highest 10 th percentile being compared to the 90 th percentile regarding their characteristics, cost patterns and outcomes. Results: A total of 7849 patients (8449 encounters) were included, with 7063 in the low-cost group and 786 patients in the high-cost group. The high-cost group had a mean age of 60.7 years. The high-cost group had a longer length of stay with a mean duration of 32.6 days in the ICU. The median direct cost per patient in the high-cost group was $148327 (IQR 114007 -224610), and the top 10% of patients amounted to 49% of direct costs. Non-survivors were more likely to have a premorbid diagnosis of congestive heart failure, OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.27 -2.68), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, OR 2.32 (95% CI 1.64 -3.28), or to be admitted after a procedural complication, OR 2.93 (95% CI 1.24 -6.90). Despite the difference in cost, the in-hospital mortality rate was 27.8% in the highcost group, compared to 29.5% in the low-cost group (p = .341). Only 10.7% of the high-cost group were ultimately dispositioned home, compared to 29.4% in the lowcost group (p < .0001), and 33.6% of patients were transferred to long term care facilities. Conclusions: In summary, in a population of high-cost ICU patients, we found that 1 3 22 the top 10% of patients are responsible for half of the total cost. Among these, only a minimal proportion are sent home. Premorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and patients admitted from procedure complications independently predicted high-cost status among non-survivors and may represent a population where cost strategies could be further explored.

Unstructured postmortem components were a) letters from family members to ICU staff and project team; b) unplanned return visits by families to debrief on terminal events, counseling requests (psychological or spiritual), reconnecting with ICU staff or project team, c) reflective notes from 5 project team members and d) hospital memorial services. The experiences of patients, family members, and clinicians were examined through analysis of interviews with 86 family members and 150 clinicians (100% participation). The interviews with family members were conducted in-person (53, 61.6%), by phone (31, 36.0%) or email (2, 2.3%) and analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: For 100 patient-family dyads, 452 wishes were implemented [314 (69.5%) antemortem and 138 (30.5%) postmortem]. Postmortem wishes included mementos and tributes to the patient, ongoing family support, observances, and acknowledgements. Offerings were from the ICU staff or project team to patients and families (e.g., dream catcher); or from the families to the ICU staff (e.g., baked goods), project team (e.g., patient's art work), future patients (e.g., room decorations) or families (e.g., frames for word clouds); or from the community to current (e.g., birthday cake) or future patients (e.g., knitted blankets). The 3 Wishes Project facilitated family re-engagement with ICU, hospital and project staff, through scheduled, structured components of the project, and also through spontaneous postmortem communications and visits. While some family members found it difficult being back in the hospital, all described the returning experience as meaningful during the grieving process. Conclusions: Whether offered formally or informally, with or without therapeutic intent, continued connections with family members of deceased patients appear to be valued, supported by ICU clinicians and welcomed by families in grief. Introduction: Intermittent renal replacement therapy is associated with dialysisinduced acute myocardial injury, in both chronic 1 and acute 2 treatments. Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is often favoured in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), hypotension or shock. Lower ultrafiltration rates, characteristic of CRRT, reduce systemic hemodynamic stress and may be cardioprotective. We assessed the impact of CRRT on the development of acute segmental myocardial injury, in critically ill patients requiring dialysis for AKI. Objectives: To assess the impact of CRRT on global and segmental left-ventricular function in critical ill patients requring dialysis for AKI. Out hypothesis was that CRRT, with its charecteristically lower ultrafiltration rates, would not induce cardiac stunning (i.e. will be cardioprotective). Methods: We used 2D-echo and speckle tracking analysis software (EchoPAC, GE Healthcare) to measure global and segmental left-ventricular myocardial longitudinal strain in 12 critically ill patients presenting with AKI. Measurements were made at baseline immediately prior to and 4, 8 and 24 hours after initiation of CRRT. Results: Measurements were completed in 11 patients. 10/11 patients developed new regional wall motion abnormalities, with 8 developing these as early as 4 hours after CRRT start. The number of affected segments varied from 1 to 11 (out of 12). Of 11 patients, 7 (58%) died in the ICU, with 5 of those dying within 2 days of CRRT initiation. Conclusions: Our results show that CRRT is associated with new regional myocardial injury. This injury was associated with high mortality. These results are concerning with respect to the presumed safety of CRRT (compared to other dialysis modalities) in critically ill patients. Further direct comparison of CRRT with other dialysis modalities is warranted to assess the potential for relative cardioprotection. Introduction: Up to 12% of the 800 000 patients who undergo mechanical ventilation in the United States every year require tracheostomies. A recent systematic review conducted by Hosokawa et al showed that early tracheostomy was associated with better outcomes: more ventilator-free days, shorter ICU stays, less sedation and reduced long-term mortality. However, no cost-analysis on the timing of early tracheostomies have been conducted. Objectives: To conduct a cost-analysis on the timing of tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated patients Methods: We collected individual length of hospital stay and length of ICU stay data from the studies included in the systematic review from Hosokawa et al. We also searched for any recent randomized control trials on the topic that were published after this review. Average daily hospital and ICU costs per patients were obtained from a cost model by Kahn et al. We estimated hospital and ICU costs by multiplying LOS with respective average daily cost per patient. We calculated difference in costs by subtracting hospital costs, ICU costs and total direct variable costs from early tracheotomy to late tracheotomy. 95% confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrap re-sampling procedures with 1000 iterations. Results: The average weighted cost of ICU stay in patients with an early tracheostomy was $ 5 063 less when compared to patients with late tracheostomy (95% CI: 355 -9770, I 2 = 89.8%). This was calculated using a random effects model. A sensitivity analysis shows consistent cost reductions even with longer LOS in the early tracheostomy group. Subgroup analysis revealed that very early tracheostomies (less than 4 days) cost on average $4492 USD less than late tracheostomies (95% CI: -1309 -10294, I 2 = 94.1%) and that early tracheostomies (less than 10 days but greater than 4) cost on average $6385 USD less than late tracheostomies (95% CI: -4396 -17165, I 2 = 70.0%) Conclusion: This study shows that early tracheostomy can significantly reduce direct variable and likely total costs in the intensive care unit based on length of stay alone. This is in addition to the already shown benefits of early tracheostomy in terms of ventilator dependent days, reduced length of stays, decreased pain, and improved communication. Further prospective studies on this topic are needed to definitely prove the cost-effectiveness of early tracheostomy in the critically ill population. Introduction: Survivors of critical illness are at risk of developing long-term physical disability. Early rehabilitation interventions, such as in-bed cycling, may improve functional outcomes. Before embarking on a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) with mechanically ventilated patients, assessment of the feasibility of routine physiotherapy (PT) interventions plus early in-bed cycling (Cycling) versus routine PT alone (Routine) and development of monitoring strategies throughout the hospital stay are of key importance. Given the complex clinical environment, the vulnerability of critically ill patients, and the novelty of an intervention that is rare in present practice, the CYCLE Pilot RCT (NCT02377830) was designed to determine the feasibility of a future large trial. Objective: To itemize and characterize trial preparation and execution activities during the CYCLE Pilot RCT in participating Intensive Care Units (ICU) and the study Methods Centre. Methods: In 7 Canadian sites, we retrospectively reviewed timelines to study initiation (e.g., research ethics board (REB) approval, first enrolment), site activities (e.g., start-up visits, protocol education, intervention delivery, outcomes measurement), and additional preparatory activities by the Methods Centre. Data sources included regulatory and Methods Centre documentation (e.g., approvals, communications, meeting agendas, coordinator notes). We report descriptive statistics as counts and proportions, and medians and quartiles (Q1-Q3). Attendees reported completing more CCUS exams per week immediately postcourse and at long term follow-up, compared to pre-course, but the number of exams per week showed trends toward decline at long term follow-up, compared to post-course. Thirty-seven respondents (63.8%) reported they did not log their CCUS exams, but 79.3% would use one if they were provided a convenient option.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Product Name Product Description Manufacturer"}, {"text": "In considering ways to support CCUS skills post-course, attendees ranked possible solutions as follows: ongoing access to modules (75.9%), virtual attendance to ultrasound image review sessions at an academic hospital ICU (69%), ultrasound image review/quality assurance (65.5%), video conference with course faculty (39.7%). Conclusions: In our examination of participant outcomes following CCUS course attendance, we found that despite CCUS uptake increasing, the absence of ongoing supervision and mentorship imposes a problematic barrier for participants seeking proficiency with the modality. Based on survey results, significant opportunity for and interest in post-course educational support exists. Given limited access to expert support, efforts should focus on delivering virtual support via video conferenced access to course faculty, case review and quality assurance of images. Introduction: Current guidelines suggest that non-benzodiazepine sedatives are the preferred sedative agents in mechanically ventilated adults in the intensive care unit (ICU). Among those agents, it is uncertain whether dexmedetomidine is better than propofol for sedation in patients after cardiac surgery. Objective: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol, in adult patients after cardiac surgery. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched PubMed, Embase, OVID Medline, and the Cochrane Library up to January 31st, 2017. The same reviewers completed abstract screening, study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. We included RCTs that enrolled adult post-cardiac surgery patients, comparing dexmedetomidine to propofol, and reported any of the following outcomes: delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, opioid requirements, and mortality. We pooled the estimate of effects across studies using a random-effects model. The results were summarized as risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes, and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. There were no statistically significant differences in ICU length of stay, mortality, or incidence of atrial fibrillation between dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation regimens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Moderate quality evidence revealed that dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative delirium, shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, and lowers opioid requirements after cardiac surgery, but may increase the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension compared with propofol.

Many aspects of DKA emergency treatment are not supported by high-level evidence and few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been done in this population. Studying time-sensitive emergency interventions can be challenging due to the need to rapidly identify and enrol potential participants. We conducted a pilot study to explore feasibility considerations and inform planning of a future RCT. Objectives: Our primary objectives were to determine the feasibility of an RCT of children with DM1 and DKA based on: 1. Timely identification of eligible participants by the research team, 2. Ability to obtain consent for data collection. We also sought to evaluate a variety of study process feasibility metrics and to characterize current DKA treatment practices.

This is thought to be caused by an increase in airway resistance [1] [2] [3] . This may reduce minute-ventilation (MV) as ventilation stops being delivered once the ventilator inspiratory pressure limit is reached. Increasing inspiratory pressure limit during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is a strategy used to help maintain MV. However, it is unclear if such strategy results in gas trapping and increased transpulmonary pressures. In the clinical setting, plateau pressures (Pplat) are commonly used to estimate transpulmonary pressures. Based on bench testing data, increasing inspiratory pressure limit preserve the MV with limited impact on Pplat in most circumstances 4, 5 . Whether increasing inspiratory pressure limit result in increased Pplat remains to be assessed in the clinical setting. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of FOB on Pplat in patients ventilated in volume-controlled mode. We hypothesized that increasing inspiratory pressure limit during FOB would not significantly affect Pplat. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU of a tertiary center teaching hospital of both medical and surgical patients (CHU de Qu\u00e9bec -Universit\u00e9 Laval / H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec). The study was approved by the local Research Ethic Board. The inclusion criteria were age \u2265 18 years and mechanically ventilated in a volume-controlled mode through an endotracheal or tracheotomy tube. The exclusion criterias were prior inclusion in the study, refusal by the treating physician, unavailability of the research team and Pplat \u2265 30 cm H2O before FOB. As standardized in our unit, the inspiratory pressure limit was increased up to 80 cmH2O during FOB. No other intervention was made. The primary outcome was variation of Pplat from baseline during FOB. We stratified by ETT size (\u22647.5 or \u2265 8.0) as ETT tube size was found to affect MV and Pplat in our physiological bench study.To detect a minimally clinically significant difference of 3 cm H2O from baseline Pplat, and a difference of 5 cm H2O between ETT groups, a total of 36 patients were enrolled (18 in each ETT group). We assumed a standard deviation of 5 cmH2O around Pplat, a power of 80% and an alpha level of 0.05.The secondary outcomes were variations in peak airway pressure and PEEP, desaturations and clinical adverse events. All analysis will be conducted using SAS 9.4. Results: 34 patients have been included in the study as of April 2017. We expect to complete the study by May 2017. Results of our analysis will be presented. Conclusion: Our study questions the optimal ventilator settings to safely perform FOB in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. It will provide evidence on whether Pplat increases or not when inspiratory pressure limit is increased. If Pplat increases, this would justify further investigation of its clinical consequences. It could also introduce the importance to monitor Pplat during FOB. If Pplat does not increase, this would support the hypothesis of increased peak airway pressures 1 3 43 induced mainly by increased airway resistance. This would support the practice to increase inspiratory pressure limit as a safe and simple measure to optimize MV during FOB. Introduction: Sepsis is challenging to identify, particularly in those patients that present in the early stages of infection (early presenters). Early recognition reduces the time to treatment, which ultimately saves lives. In 2016, new Sepsis-3 criteria, specifically qSOFA (quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) were identified. It is unknown how frontline Registered Nurses (RNs) working in the Emergency Department (ED) are operationalizing these new criteria. Objective: We sought to understand how RNs in the ED use the new Sepsis-3 criteria and their clinical experience to identify patients with suspected infection or sepsis, requiring timely treatment. Methods: To understand RNs' operationalization of sepsis, including the new Sepsis-3 criteria, a 7-item survey was developed and distributed to all RNs at the Hamilton General Hospital; an urban tertiary-care ED. During phase 1 the questionnaire was piloted with a convenience sample of 7 RNs in which feedback was obtained on sentence structure to 6 questions. Phase 2 tested for clinical sensibility of the questionnaire, a convenience sample of 7 respondents provided feedback using a 5-point Likert scale. The clinical sensibility testing covered several domains: appropriateness, redundancy, and survey completion time. We invited feedback on education around the new Sepsis-3 criteria and preferred learning strategy. Phase 3 included distribution of the final survey using paper versions and electronically via SurveyMonkey\u00ae. Respondents were asked to provide demographic data: sex, education, and clinical experience. Results: The survey was distributed to 79 ED RNs, of which 50 (63%) completed the survey. The average time to completion was 3.8 minutes. Respondents identified hypotension (64.0%), heart rate (58.0%), and temperature (54.0%) as the best characteristics to identify patients with suspected sepsis. Using a Likert scale, 48 (96%) respondents scored an average of 4.3 out of 5 for their level of confidence with early recognition of patients with sepsis. Despite the new Sepsis-3 criteria published 1 year ago, 33 (66.0%) respondents were not familiar with qSOFA, 13 (26.0%) were aware it existed but had not been educated on it, 4 (8.0%) were familiar with the criteria but relied on other variables to identify septic patients, and none claimed to have thorough understanding of the qSOFA criterion for sepsis. The majority (82%) of respondents agreed that the Sepsis-3 criteria is effective in identifying patients with potential sepsis, and a medical directive should be available for RNs to identify and initiate treatment of septic patients or those at risk. Conclusion: We have identified a knowledge gap in nursing understanding of the new Sepsis-3 criteria. In this cohort of ED nurses, hypotension was identified as the number one indicator for sepsis patients, thus matching 1 of the 3-qSOFA criteria. Respondents identified an interest in learning about Sepsis-3 and qSOFA via a variety of educational modes. Furthermore, ED nurses support the use of a medical directive in suspected septic patients. A larger study of Emergency Department nurses to yield further information and impact on practice is recommended. Background: Reducing hospital harm is an important patient safety goal. Unexpected ICU admissions from the ward are high morbidity, high cost events that are important to examine to improve patient safety. The objective of this study is to describe opportunities to improve care by characterizing the cause and timeline of unexpected ICU admissions from the ward in an academic, integrated, healthcare system. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to eight general medical and surgical wards at two academic hospitals from January to June 2014. A team of trained reviewers abstracted charts for demographic data, co-morbid status, ward admission diagnosis, ICU admission diagnosis, ICU and hospital length of stay, unexpected ICU transfer, and death. Patients unexpectedly admitted to the ICU from the ward were included in the analysis. Patients admitted for routine post-operative monitoring were excluded unless the reason for surgery was unexpected. Two reviewers coded the diagnoses independently, met to compare coding and reviewed discrepancies as a team until agreement was reached. We described the cause and timeline of unexpected ICU admissions from the ward and compared the diagnosis leading to ICU admission with the diagnosis at ward admission. Results: We analyzed 164 unexpected ICU admissions from 7130 total ward admissions. There were 23.0 unexpected ICU admissions / 1000 ward admissions. The three most common diagnostic conditions associated with unexpected ICU admission from the ward were, infection (22.6%), respiratory failure (18.3%), and CHF (9.1%). 71.5% of infections associated with ICU admissions were not noted at the time of ward admission. We found that 50.6% of unexpected ICU admissions occurred within 3 days of ward admission, and 82.9% of ICU admissions occurred within 8 days. Conclusion: Common reasons for unexpected ICU admission from the ward are infection, respiratory failure and CHF. The majority of infections leading to ICU admission are diagnosed after hospitalization. Unexpected ICU admissions typically occur within a week of hospitalization with half occurring within the first 3 days of hospitalization. Strategies to reduce the risk of unexpected ICU admission should focus on early prevention and management of infection, respiratory failure and CHF. Healthcare Hamilton ICU, a 21-bed medical-surgical tertiary care unit. Patients and families were invited to participate after a decision was made to withdraw advanced life support or after the intensivist estimated that the probability of dying in the ICU was > 95%. Patients were excluded if they were in the ICU for less than <12 hours. A project team member or bedside clinician elicited and implemented at least 3 wishes of the patient, family or clinicians that honoured the patient and family. From the original 5 wish categories, in triplicate, 3 investigators interpreted and reclassified 1376 wishes into a new taxonomy of 12 categories (connections, providing food and beverage, humanizing the environment, humanizing the patient, music, family care, rituals and spiritual support, preparations and final arrangements, word clouds, keepsakes and tributes, organ donation and paying it forward). We calculated the percentage of each wish category and analyzed the distribution of wish categories annually. Introduction: Physician's estimate of the prognosis of patients' is essential to shared decision making in the intensive care unit (ICU). The variables influencing these judgments are not well understood. Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine which individual physician and patient characteristics influence physician\u00b4s predictions of patient's mortality at 6 months. Additionally, we explored which of these factors are associated with the confidence of the predictions. Methods: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study that evaluated how well ICU physicians predicted patients' long-term outcomes. Recruitment occurred from October 2013 to May 2014 in 5 ICUs in the University of Pennsylvania. Patients were included if they required mechanical ventilation > 48 hours, vasopressors >24 hours, or both. ICU attending physicians were asked to predict whether patients were expected to live or die in 6-months, and to report their confidence in these predictions. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the association between baseline physician and patient characteristics with study outcomes: 6-month mortality prediction (yes/no) and confidence of the prediction (yes/no). We graphically explored the linear association between continuous predictors and outcomes. We calculated c statistics for each logistic regression model and goodness of fit was measured using Hosmer Lemeshow. Results: Of 340 eligible patients, 303 were enrolled. Forty-seven physicians contributed at least one prediction per patient. Patient's median age was 62 years old (IQR 53-71) and 57% (N=157) were male. Physicians median age was 41 (IQR 38-53) and 80% (N=37) were male. Mortality at 6 months was predicted for 33% (N=99), of which 43% (N=130) died. The final multivariable model (Table 2 ) explaining physicians' predictions of mortality included patient's age (OR 1.03; 95%CI 1.01-1.05), the presence of malignancy (OR 2.70; 1.54-4.74); medical (vs. surgical patients) (OR 5.87; 95%CI 2.70-12.7) and patient's APACHE score (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1.01-1.02). This model deemed good discrimination (C statistic=0.77; 95% CI 0.72-0.83) and calibration (difference between expected and observed p value=0.87). The same variables were also associated with patient's actual mortality at 6 months (Table 3 ). Physician's age (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.90-0.96), physician's male gender (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.88) and years since graduation (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) were associated lower confidence of the prediction (Table 3) . A higher APACHE score was also associated with lower confidence (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99). Conclusion: Physician and patient factors are associated with predictions of mortality and patient's actual mortality at 6 months. These include patient age, presence of malignancy, being a medical patient and severity of illness. Physician age, being male, years of experience and severity of illness were inversely associated with confidence in these predictions. This information should be considered when physicians reflect on how they make predictions for critically ill patients. Introduction: Long-term cognitive dysfunction is common in ICU survivors (1). Its temporal course remains unclear, impeding identification of appropriate time windows for therapeutic target discovery and interventions. This is partly due to lack of neurocognitive tests that are comprehensive, easy to administer and do not require presence of trained personnel. Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS) is a validated web-based neurocognitive test battery previously used in large cohort studies, can be self-administered by patients, and allows testing frequencies not feasible with standard paper-based methods, making it an attractive method for objectively quantifying ICU-related cognitive dysfunction. However, CBS has never been evaluated in ICU patients. Objectives: To determine the feasibility of using web-based neurocognitive battery for assessment of cognitive function in ICU survivors. Methods: We recruited adult (age \u2265 18 years), non-delirious patients who were intubated for a minimum of 24 hours from two ICUs in London, Ontario. Patients with a documented history of dementia or neurological diseases were excluded. Demographic and clinical variables were recorded from medical records. Patients completed at least one CBS battery in the ICU, or shortly after discharge from ICU. Patients were considered impaired on a cognitive test if they scored > 2 standard deviations (SD) below the healthy population norms corrected for age and sex. Feasibility issues associated with web-based cognitive testing in ICU patients were recorded. Results: Of 44 patients approached, 21 underwent cognitive testing and 18 (6 females) were included in the analysis, with 15 of these completing the full 12-test battery. Median age was 62 years (SD 13.2), NEMS score 18 (SD 5.6), and ICU length of stay 5 days (SD 5.0). Twelve patients were tested in the ICU and 6 were tested within 1-4 days of transfer to ward. Fifteen of 18 patients were impaired on at least one test, with the median impairment of 2 tests (range 0-8). Feasibility issues with CBS included: unclear test interface (difficulty focusing on the appropriate part of computer monitor); patient fatigue due to battery length (with 3 of 18 completing partial battery only); complex test instructions; lack of progress feedback; test sounds disturbing other patients in shared rooms; and patient inexperience with using a computer mouse. Conclusion: Web-based cognitive testing is feasible in ICU patients. Feasibility issues need to be addressed in order to optimize this form of testing in ICU survivors. Our results will inform modification of a web-based battery for ICU needs, and help with the design of future observational studies. Introduction: Frailty is an increasingly recognized phenomenon in the healthcare of older-adults. Patient mobility is an important and well-recognized marker of clinical frailty 1 . Early mobilization in the intensive care unit (ICU) improves patient outcomes 2, 3 . Changes in mobility of individuals who are acutely unwell is under studied and has important implications on recovery and prognosis. Objectives: To investigate patient mobility as a clinical predictor in a critically ill older-adult patient population. Specifically, to investigate whether severity of illness at time of ICU admission is predictive of mobility performance and to assess whether changes in patient mobility correlate with in-hospital mortality. Methods: A single center prospective cohort study involving critically ill patients aged 65 and older admitted to the QEII's medical-surgical ICU. APACHE II scores were calculated at time of ICU admission to stratify critical illness severity. Physiotherapists integrated the HABAM into routine daily mobility assessments in the ICU. Additional items relevant to mobility in the ICU were added to the HABAM based on interdisciplinary team consensus -creating a modified CritCare-HABAM. Patient descriptive and changes in patient mobility up to four days in ICU were analyzed against in-hospital mortality using univariate regression analysis. Changes in patient mobility were also analyzed according to admission APACHE II score. This represents the first participants enrolled and completed hospitalization. Enrolment is ongoing. Results: A total of 38 patients were recruited and 34 were mobilized at least two days in ICU. Average APACHE II score was 23.3 (SD 6.57). Ten participants (26%) died in hospital. The CritCare-HABAM predicted in hospital mortality if there was a failure to improve in any of the three mobility domains or two-out-of-three domains (p=0.023 and p=0.039, respectively) whereas if there was failure to improve in any of the three mobility domains of the HABAM, there was a trend for significance (p=0.059). Neither increased severity of critical illness (APACHE II > 23) nor frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale > 4) were associated with decreased mobility performance (p=0.19).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 180, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 181, "end": 184, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 185, "end": 188, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 787, "end": 789, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 790, "end": 791, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 15973, "end": 15974, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 16055, "end": 16057, "text": "2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 16058, "end": 16059, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 11786, "end": 11794, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF19"}, {"start": 12291, "end": 12299, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF33"}, {"start": 12506, "end": 12515, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF33"}], "section": "Introduction:"}, {"text": "The HABAM can be used in the ICU and changes in mobility predict in hospital death.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "53", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "3"}, {"text": "The debate over what maintenance intravenous (IV) solution is the most appropriate for children has been ongoing for decades (1) .

All patients aged under 18 years admitted between January 1st, 2015 -January 31st, 2016, who received at least 50% of their maintenance fluid requirements parenterally, were included. The primary outcome was IV maintenance fluid prescription practices in the first 72 hours of admission. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of iatrogenic hyperchloremia and of HCMA in the first 72 hours of admission, predictors of iatrogenic HCMA, and the association between HCMA and clinical outcomes. We calculated that a sample size of 700 patients would enable us to achieve our primary and secondary outcomes. Descriptive analyses were used to present demographic data and the primary outcome, and regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors of HCMA. Results: Of 771 patients admitted between January 1 st , 2015 -January 31 st , 2016, 541 were eligible. The median age was 69 months and 56% were males. 400 (74%) were medical patients and 141 (26%) were surgical patients. Normal Saline was the most commonly prescribed solution for IV maintenance over the first 72h of admission, followed by Ringer's Lactate, and hypotonic solutions (Figure 1 ; 74.1%, 23.4%, and 2.5%, respectively). Ringer's Lactate prescriptions increased while normal saline prescriptions decreased over time, in parallel to the daily prevalence of hyperchloremia. The incidence of hyperchloremia and HCMA over the first 72h of admission was 93.8% and 34.9%, respectively. Ongoing analyses will determine predictors of HCMA and their potential association with adverse events. Conclusion: Isotonic solutions comprised the overwhelming majority of IV maintenance fluid prescriptions, while balanced salt solutions are not used in these centers. Ringer's lactate use increased over the first 72h in response to increasing hyperchloremia. Iatrogenic hyperchloremia and HCMA appears to be extremely common in PICUs, observed here at a rate much higher than that reported in critically ill adults. The results of this study will provide a rationale to evaluate what type of isotonic solutions may be more appropriate in critically ill children, in order to minimize IV fluid associated morbidities. (1), however the relationship between physical function at ICU discharge and more proximal outcomes is unknown. The Physical Function ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s) is a reliable and valid measure of function in patients with critical illness. It includes 4 items (shoulder and knee extensor strength, amount of assistance required to stand, stepping cadence), and scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting better function.(2, 3) While studies from Australia(4) and the United States(5) identified positive relationships between higher PFIT-s scores and better hospital discharge disposition, the generalizability of these findings in Canada are unknown.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1167, "end": 1176, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Methods: This retrospective chart review was conducted at McMaster and Stollery"}, {"text": "Objectives: To predict the relationship between PFIT-s scores at ICU discharge and outcomes at hospital discharge in a cohort of Canadian ICU survivors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods: This retrospective chart review was conducted at McMaster and Stollery"}, {"text": "Methods: This is a secondary analysis of 2 studies from the CYCLE Research Program: TryCYCLE (NCT01885442), a single-centre, 33-patient prospective cohort study of early in-bed cycling (6) , and CYCLE Pilot (NCT02377830), a 7-centre, 66 patient RCT of early in-bed cycling and routine physiotherapy interventions versus routine physiotherapy interventions alone (7) . Both of these studies included adult patients within the first 4 days of mechanical ventilation and first 7 days of ICU admission who could ambulate independently pre-hospital with or without a gait aid, and had no other exclusions. At ICU discharge, trained physiotherapists collected the PFIT-s. We prospectively identified whether ICU survivors with PFIT scores met any of 3 conditions comprising a composite outcome of poor health status at hospital discharge: 1) mortality, 2) readmission to ICU, or 3) discharge requiring paid assistance (e.g., home care, rehabilitation, assisted living, etc. 40%. This analysis underscores the prognostic value of physical functional disability after ICU discharge and its potential use predicting poor health status at hospital discharge. These findings may be useful in the evaluation of rehabilitation interventions designed to optimize patients' function and independence after hospitalization. Introduction: Viral bronchiolitis is one of the most prevalent causes of illness requiring hospitalization among children worldwide 1 and one of the most common reasons for admission to pediatric intensive care. It has been hypothesized that coinfection with bacteria results in more severe clinical outcomes. However, the effects of bacterial colonization, affecting upwards of 15% of healthy children 2 , on critically ill patients with bronchiolitis have yet to be proven. Current clinical management consists primarily of supportive therapies with the role of antibiotics remaining controversial. 3 Objectives/Methods: A retrospective review of all critically ill children admitted to the BC Children's Hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) from 2014-2017 with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis was performed. Routine testing in this timeframe consisted of complete pathogen testing, including PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Analyses were performed to determine the impact of bacterial colonization and antibiotic use on a primary outcome of PICU length-of-stay, with secondary outcomes of hospital stay and duration of ventilation. Results: There were 92 patients with complete pathogen testing performed during the assessed timeframe. A comparison between children with detected Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and those without (n=70) revealed no significant (p=0.20) differences in severity of illness on presentation as per PRISM III scores (mean=3.0). Patients colonized with S. pneumoniae had significantly shorter PICU stays (p=0.002), hospital stays (p=0.0001) and duration of non-invasive ventilation (p=0.002). Multivariate analyses reveals that these effects on length of PICU stay and duration of ventilation do not persist after controlling for antibiotic use, presence of radiographic consolidation, age, and severity of illness (p=0.15, p=0.32). The relationship between colonization and duration of hospital stay persists after controlling for these variables (p=0.008). Conclusions: Children with viral bronchiolitis colonized with S. pneumoniae appear to have shorter hospital stays but similar length of PICU stays and duration of ventilation compared to children who are not colonized. Consistent with current literature 4 , the results of this study suggest bacterial colonization is not associated with increased severity of presenting illness or negative clinical outcomes. Introduction: Critically ill patients that require intubation are at high risk of hypoxia and cardiovascular instability. One in 4 major adverse airway events occur in the intensive care unit or emergency department. Timely and effective communication among team members is crucial during this high-risk procedure. Evidence from military and pre-hospital medicine has shown that standardized checklists limit human error and improve team communication and patient safety. The aim of this project was to implement the use of a team time-out with the communication of an intubation plan and team member concerns and increase the use of these tools to up to 80% in ICU intubations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 188, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1712, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1910, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3560, "end": 3561, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods: This retrospective chart review was conducted at McMaster and Stollery"}, {"text": "The study was conducted in medical-surgical intensive care units at two academic hospitals in Toronto. We identified current deficits in team communication by engaging stakeholders involved in intubations. We surveyed ICU nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists to understand the perception of team efficacy in communication, equipment preparation, and patient safety and monitoring. We also audited ICU intubations to identify whether intubation plan, airway assessment, team concerns, and team member roles were verbalized prior to conducting the procedure. We used the survey and audit data to design and implement a preintubation communication tool. The implementation process involved 1) education sessions with physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses, and 2) printed reminders in the ICU and intubation equipment cart. Results: Three main deficits in pre-intubation communication were identified. In the observed intubations, only 40% included team time outs, 70% had intubation plans verbalized, and 50% had team member concerns addressed. Fewer than 50% of survey respondents felt that any of these areas were consistently communicated during intubations. The final communication tool contained 6 components: 1) team time out, 2) indication for intubation, 3) team member roles, 4) equipment readiness, 5) intubation plan, and 6) final concerns. A post implementation audit and stakeholder survey is in progress. Conclusion: Intubation in critically ill patients is a high-risk procedure. Our assessment of current intubation practice identifies deficits in team communication that have potential impact on team member preparation and patient safety. We have implemented a bedside tool consisting of six key items. Educational sessions were provided to staff to understand and use the tool.

They have their indications, benefits, side-effects and complications. Evidence suggests that such prescriptions are rarely ever done correctly despite the presence of clear guidelines [1, 2] . This is thought to be due to lack of knowledge and experience, placing patients at increased risk of harm, also incurring unnecessary costs to the hospital. Objective: To ensure that all IV fluid prescriptions are safe, appropriate and adhere to NICE guidance by August 2017. Methods: Review and improve the prescribing process of \"IV fluid prescribing\" via three simultaneous approaches (figure 1). Teaching sessions were delivered to all junior doctors in order to improve knowledge and awareness of appropriate IV fluid prescribing and promote familiarity with the current NICE IV fluid guidelines. This included a 'feature session' at our local hospital Grand Round. A point-of-care aide-memoire containing a summary of the information needed for correct prescription was designed and printed. This complimented the teaching sessions and supported good clinical practice. Using serial Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, a novel \"IV fluid bundle\" (figure 2) was developed, fine-tuned and trialled on five wards, (three surgical, two medical). The aim of the bundle was to ensure that patients were clinically reviewed in order to assess their volaemic status in order that appropriate IV fluids could then be selected and prescribed safely. Results: The impact of these interventions was assessed on the trial wards via a weekly point prevalence audit of the IV fluid bundles for the duration of the trial. Parameters looked at were: incidence of deranged U&E's, incidence of AKI and the number of days between the latest U&E's and the patient's IV fluid prescription. With only a 50% uptake we were able to significantly improve outcomes. Of all of the patients on the IV fluid bundle, 100% had a documented review of both fluid status and balance. The incidence of deranged U&E's decreased from 48% to 35%. Incidence of AKI decreased 14% to 10%. The average number of days between the latest U&E's and a fluid prescription decreased from 2.2 days to 1.0 day. Conclusion: Prescribing IV fluids is a complex task. It is an area of clinical practice that requires significant improvement both locally and nationally. The project included carefully structured interventions geared towards tackling the confounding issues (education, awareness and organisational systems) identified from previous audits and process mapping. Changing prescribing habits is an extremely challenging goal for many reasons. The introduction of a change that incorporates something clear and simple has a minimal effect on compliance. The design of a simple IV fluid bundle ensured minimal interference. Since commencing the project, we have seen an improvement in the knowledge base around IV fluid safety. We have also noticed a clear improvement in the prescription of IV fluids in our trust. Even though only a small representative sample of wards were selected for the fluid bundle trial, feedback was highly positive and reports were that the bundle was a help, not a hindrance. We anticipate that further improvements will be achieved once the bundle has been incorporated into the hospital's electronic prescribing system eliminating confusion 1 3", "cite_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 397, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 398, "end": 400, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Improving the Prescribing of IV Fluids"}, {"text": "Sampaio, Tatiana Z.A.L. 1 Introduction: Sedation and analgesia are used to manage ventilated pediatric patients comfortably and safely.

Patients with a tracheostomy, ECMO, hemodialysis, and patients that died before sedation wean were excluded. Presence of under-sedation (US) was defined by SBS>0, presence of over-sedation (OS) was defined as SBS<-1 and presence of pain as CBS > 17 [4] . The targets for sedation and analgesia were collected daily and categorized as first order set, second order set, third order set and fourth order set. Results: 45 patients were included. The median age was 23 months (IQR 3.5-138), 40% of patients had a respiratory illness, 42% had a pre-existing condition, their PELOD-2 [7] score median was 5 (IQR: 4, 7). All but 1 patient experienced OS in some point of their time ventilated. Only 4 patients did not experience US or pain during the days that they were ventilated. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients that experienced over-sedation or under-sedation per days after intubation. A total of 454 ventilation days were analyzed in this chart review 252 (55.5%) there was documented over-sedation,181(39.9%) under-sedation and 165 (36.3%) pain. 93.3% of patients had at least one set of SBS and MCS targets ordered, 77.8% in the first day of admission, and 60% had targets orders reviewed once. Table 1 attached is showing the targets of SBS and CBS ordered ranging from-1 to -2 and 8 to 14 respectively. Conclusions: This study showed that patients in our institution were frequently over-sedated, reflecting targets that were ordered in lower ranges than those recommended by literature [4] , which enabled over-sedation. MD orders of sedation and analgesia were identified as a root cause for over-sedation and consequently IWS. Simple and easy changes in documentation and daily bedside safety checklist were established in order to optimize use of sedation and analgesia and decrease complications related to over and under-sedation.

Given this, a strategy to optimize health care provider performance is required. Performance scorecards have been utilized by healthcare institutions for the purposes of monitoring clinical performance and driving quality improvement. Unfortunately, most scorecards use overall outcomes that are hard to attribute to an individual. Furthermore, individuals will often tailor their practice to optimize scorecard variables (so-called \"gaming\"), instead of patient-centred care. While scorecards have been introduced in CCM to monitor safety, there is no widely-accepted or standardized scorecard that has been utilized for overall CCM performance.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study in which we evaluated the clinical course of all hemodynamically unstable patients with RV failure in whom iNO was initiated without intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) of our two centers between 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome was modifications in RV function parameters after starting iNO, and secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, mortality, and occurrence of specific side effects (acute kidney injury as per the RIFLE 6 definition, significant bleeding prompting clinical intervention and persistent headache in the patient or nursing staff). Results: 18 patients were included in the analysis, 12 (67%) received iNO after cardiac surgery (mean EuroscoreII 19 \u00b1 14) and 6 (33%) received iNO in a nonsurgical context. Median [Q1; Q3] iNO concentration was 20 [20; 20] ((systolic PAP -diastolic PAP)/CVP) increased from 1.45 to 2.24 (P=0.002), as did the indexed cardiac output from 2.0 to 2.6 l/min/m 2 (P=0.004). These rapid hemodynamic changes were not associated with significant modifications of vasopressor and inotrope doses. ICU mortality was 27.78% and median ICU length of stay was 7 [5; 9] days. Two significant bleeding episodes and one acute kidney injury occurred during iNO therapy but none was felt to be attributable to iNO. No headache was reported by the patients or nursing staff. Conclusion: Non-invasively administered iNO was associated with favourable hemodynamic effects in ICU patients with acute RV failure. This is the first report regarding such a therapeutic approach for these clinically challenging patients. Our results suggest the safety and feasibility of this therapy for which further prospective study is warranted.

Anaesthesia was induced with Midazolem, Etomidate, Fentanyl and Rocuronium after applying the standard monitoring. Before induction lumbar drain was inserted and the transduced pressure was 13 mm Hg. a left radial arterial line was placed. A left sided double lumen tube of size 37 was tried initially but due to compression of left main bronchus by the aneurysm the tube was placed on the right side .After two attempts an ETT size 8.5 was passed with a bronchial blocker. central venous and swans ganz catheter were inserted. One lung ventilation was established. Anaesthesia was maintained with 40% oxygen and Isoflurane (0.9-1.3). A total of 1000 micrograms of fentanyl was administered throughout the case. A TEE probe was placed for monitoring of left ventricular function. The patient was heparinized; common femoral artery and vein were cannulated and then cooled to 20\u2070C. In the process. The aneurysm was then opened longitudinally. A 28mm Vascutek Dacron was anastomosed end to end. The operative findings revealed a very large dissecting aneurysm starting flush with left subclavian artery. The CSF pressure was continuously monitored during the procedure and CSF was passively drained when the pressure exceeds 13 mm Hg. During the case 10-20 mls of CSF was drained to maintain the pressure between 9-13 mm Hg. The patient was then shifted to CICU where he kept ventilated. He was then weaned from ventilator and extubated on fourth post op day but was reintubated on sixth post op day for drowsiness due to raised serum ammonia levels. Gradually the GCS restored to 10/10. Afterwards the patient had sepsis, acute kidney injury and ventilator associated pneumonia. Blood cultures were positive for carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Experimental data and prior observations in nonmechanically ventilated patients suggest that draining effusions may improve diaphragm mechanics [3, 4] but this hypothesis has not been tested in mechanically ventilated patients. We undertook to determine whether pleural drainage enhances diaphragmatic pressure generation in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: We enrolled mechanically ventilated patients with large pleural effusions on chest radiograph who had been selected by the medical team to undergo pleural drainage. An esophageal catheter was placed to record esophageal (Pes) and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and diaphragm electrical activity (Edi). Pressures and Edi were recorded while subjects were placed on a CPAP trial with zero airway pressure (for up to 10 minutes as tolerated) before and after pleural drainage. Changes in Pes were corrected for swings in gastric pressure (Pga) due to expiratory abdominal muscle activity. The primary outcome was neuromuscular coupling (NMC) of the diaphragm, defined as the ratio of Pdi to Edi [5] . We also examined changes in NMC of the respiratory system (Pes/Edi), neuroventilatory coupling (NVC, tidal volume Vt/Edi), dynamic compliance (Cdyn = Vt/P L , transpulmonary pressure), and respiratory timing parameters. Results: Four patients were enrolled, Three of four subjects could not complete the 10-minute CPAP trial prior to drainage (median 6.6 minutes). All subjects underwent pleural drainage (volume drained 400cc-1510cc). Immediately following pleural drainage, all subjects completed the 10-minute CPAP trial without distress. Venous CO 2 tensions were unchanged before and after drainage. Diaphragm NMC increased following drainage ( Figure 1A, p<0.001) , although the improvement was observed in 3 of 4 patients (NMC increased by 17% to 50%). Respiratory NMC increased in all subjects ( Figure 1B, p<0 .001, range 19%-87%). Increases in NMC were accompanied by decreases in end-expiratory Pes, though one subject exhibited a paradoxical increase in end-expiratory Pes. Cdyn improved in 2 of 4 subjects ( Figure 1C ). These combined changes in NMC and Cdyn gave rise to significant improvements in NVC ( Figure 1D , p<0.001, range 13%-77%). One subject exhibited a significant (57%) decrease in respiratory rate after drainage without changes in venous PCO 2 . Conclusion: We observed significant improvements in diaphragm NMC, respiratory NMC, and CPAP trial tolerance following pleural drainage, consistent with the hypothesis that pleural effusions impede weaning from ventilation by impairing diaphragm mechanics. These findings suggest that pleural drainage may provide the greatest benefit to patients with reduced maximal inspiratory pressuregenerating capacity. Background/Aim: Bacterial pneumonia and septic shock are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) methodology allows the development of predictive models using binary splits and offers an intuitive method for predicting outcome using processes familiar to clinicians. We aimed to improve determinations of prognosis at the time of admission for pneumonia and septic shock using CART model analysis. Methods: CART models were applied to all pneumonia-associated septic shock patients between 1996 and 2015 (n=4222) from the international, multicenter CATSS database. The association between patient and practice-related factors (time delay to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, severity of illness) and in-hospital mortality were evaluated. The accuracy in prediction of outcome (AC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and area under receiver-operating curve (AUROC) of the final model were evaluated in training (n=2111) and testing (n=2111) sets. Results: In the overall cohort (n=4222, mean age 62 years, 61% male), overall mortality at hospital discharge was 51%. Sixty-three percent (n=2652) were culture positive (tracheal aspirate/sputum or blood), 21% (n=876) had co-existent bacteremia and 35% (n=1075) had nosocomial infections. Of culture positive patients, the most common pathogens were staphylococcus sp. (n=702/2652, 27%), streptococcus sp. (n=658, 25%), pseudomonas sp. (n=267, 10%), Escherichia coli (n=225, 8.5%), Klebsiella sp. (n=183, 6.9%) and Haemophilus influenzae (n=118, 4.4%). On ICU admission, mean (SD) APACHEII was 26(8) and lactate 4.1 (3.9) mmol/L. While in ICU, 89% (n=3760) required mechanical ventilation and 11% (n=464) required new renal replacement therapy. Of 3048 patients who received appropriate antimicrobial therapy after the development of hypotension (shock), the mean delay to therapy was 10.9 hours. In the training set (n=2111) a new CART model (see Figure 1 ) using APACHEII \u2265 28, lactate \u2265 6.3 mmol/L, age > 65 and delay to appropriate antimicrobial therapy \u2265 6.6 hours yielded predictive AC 73%, SP 75%, SN 71% and AUROC 0.75. In the testing set (n=2111), the CART model offered predictive AC 69%, SP 72%, SN 65%, AUROC 0.72. of which were hospital/institute specific, and six provincial. There was no significant difference between mean time for applications that went through a hospital compared to provincial REB (46.56 days (SD: 29.72) vs 20.67 days (SD: 20.05), p =0.1). Eight sites required local privacy office reviews prior to study start day, for purposes of data sharing agreements. In most cases, this was completed concurrently during the time of clinical trial agreements and research ethics, but caused a delay in the startup of one site. Provincial privacy reviews were required for data sharing agreements with three organ donation organizations. We have completed two privacy reviews, which took an average of 113 days. Although this process did not cause a delay in implementing the study, it has hindered Canada-DONATE from collecting recipient data in one province. This application is still ongoing after 646 days. Lastly, the clinical trial agreements took on average 115 days (SD: 45.24) from when the site first received a template copy until the contract was fully executed. The variability in regulatory processes across sites is likely due to 1) unique requirements at the site level (e.g. internal privacy office), 2) provincial legislation, 3) the need for REB approval for both donors and recipients and 4) the perception that donation and transplantation should be keep separated.

The environmental risk factors most frequently reported to disrupt sleep in ICU were nursing care, environmental noise, and lights. Among disease-related variables, disease severity was inconsistently found to be a risk factor. Pharmacological risk factors reported included use of any sedative agent, benzodiazepines, propofol, morphine, midazolam, and steroids.

It is therefore conceivable that ICU patients and their families are likely to be the individuals under the most physical and psychological distress and would benefit most from end-of-life care (EOLC) and palliative care (PC). Recently, hospitals have started integrating palliative care in the ICU (ICU-PC), and it has shown to improve patients' symptom management and overall quality of life.

We found marked heterogeneity in the timing of radiological examinations and timing and method of neurological assessments.

Future research should directly compare these tests and their additive value to clinical examination. Introduction: Cerebral autoregulation (CA) protects the brain from ischemic or hyperemic injuries via modulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). CA may be impaired in critically ill patients, possibly contributing to high incidence of delirium and longterm cognitive impairment in this population. Prior studies showed both normal and impaired CA in critically ill patients, but both static and dynamic measures are often done at over a limited observation period potentially missing the changes in CA status over the course of a typical ICU day. In this study, we monitored CA over 8 continuous hours in a cohort of critically ill patients using Mx, the moving correlation coefficient between CBF and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Objectives: To assess the status of CA over 8 hours of continuous observation in a cohort of critically ill patients admitted with sepsis or cardiac arrest. Methods: We recorded middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) using transcranial Doppler and MAP over 8 hours in a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients. We then examined the data offline and removed sections with poor MCAv or MAP signal, as well as any artefacts (e.g. movement resulting in loss of Doppler signal), and calculated Mx as the moving correlation coefficient between remaining MCAv and MAP data using 300 second intervals. We plotted Mx data vs. time for each patient to determine the status of CA. Mx value > 0.3 was used as a cut-off to determine impaired autoregulation. Results: We completed these measurements in 12 patients (8 septic, 9 male). The Mx vs. time profile varied considerably within and between patients. All patients displayed multiple transient spontaneous excursion of Mx above 0.3, suggesting a temporary loss of CA capacity. The frequency and duration of these excursions varied between patients. Excursions lasting more than 20 minutes were observed in only 6 patients, potentially rendering them vulnerable to ischemic or hyperemic injuries. Conclusions: In our cohort, all patients experienced multiple episodes of impaired CA of varying frequency and duration, with half of them losing CA for an extended and potentially dangerous time period. Further research is needed to determine whether the frequency and/or duration of the observed excursions correlate with delirium or long-term cognitive impairment.

A subset of consenting individuals comprised a longitudinal cohort followed over 12 months. Costs were calculated from ICU and hospital length of stay for each patient and unit costs of for admission from Canadian academic hospital. Physical recovery at 12 months was defined as a Short Form-36 physical function score of at least 10 and no lower than 10 points below their pre-admission score [3] . Costs were expressed (in Canadian Dollars) as mean cost per patient per hospitalization, as well as total cost consumed per survivor and per survivor with recovery of baseline physical function. Results: In total, 1,671 patients were included; 610 were enrolled in the longitudinal cohort. The average age was 85 years; median length of stay was 4 days in ICU and 17 days in hospital; hospital mortality was 35% (585/1,671). Of the 505 evaluable patients in the longitudinal cohort at 12 months, 24% (123/505) had survived with recovery of their physical function. The average cost of in-patient care per patient was $34,070\u00b173,347. Total cost incurred was $52,423 per survivor to discharge and $163,108 per survivor with recovery of physical function at 12 months. Conclusion: Very elderly patients admitted to ICU represent a group with very high total costs of hospitalization per functional survivor. In a resource-limited healthcare system, these figures are crucial for informing clinical decisions and policymaking, and reinforce the importance of early goals of care discussion to avoid both undesired and potentially non-beneficial interventions that carry substantial costs. Introduction: Previously, increased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) > 70mmHg has been associated with the onset of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recently, the concept of individualized perfusion targets using real time autoregulation assessment has emerged and at times, requires CPP titration > 70mmHg. Given historical concerns with increased incidence of ARDS, the association between ARDS and increased CPP requires further research. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between increased cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome versus those who do not. Methods: We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study investigating the association of increased CPP in patients who developed ARDS versus those who did not. We collected demographic data pertaining to age, gender, GCS motor score, Rotterdam CT score and mechanism of injury. We also collected physiologic data for CPP, intracranial pressure, ventilation parameters, cumulative fluid balance and delta pressure. Finally, we collected outcomes measures pertaining to duration of ventilation, length of ICU admission, length of hospitalzation and six month neurological outcome. Results: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 113 patients with severe TBI who underwent multimodal neuromonitoring. The mean age was 39 years (SD 17) and 26 / 113 (23%) were female gender. The median motor score was 3 (IQR 1 -4). The median Rotterdam score was 3 (IQR 3 -4). Sixteen patients (14%) developed ARDS according to the Berlin definition. There was no difference in the mean CPP during the first 7 days of admission between patients who developed ARDS (74mmHg SD 18 vs. 73mmHg SD 18, p=0.86) versus those who did not.

Introduction: Acute increases in muscle echodensity (sonographic signal attenuation or 'greyness') reflect muscle injury in athletes, patients in chronic muscular disease states, and muscle inflammation in critically ill patients. Diaphragm structure and function are known to deteriorate during mechanical ventilation, but changes in diaphragm echodensity have not been described to date. Objectives: We set out to establish the reproducibility of a technique for quantifying diaphragm echodensity in mechanically ventilated patients and to characterize the trajectory of diaphragm echodensity according to clinical outcome and diaphragm function. Methods: Thickness and echodensity of the right hemidiaphragm were measured on a daily basis for up to 14 days of mechanical ventilation. Maximal diaphragm thickening was measured on or before day 7 of ventilation. Echodensity was also measured in 10 healthy subjects. Three different ultrasound devices were employed for the study (Phillips Sparq, Mindray, Fujifilm Sonosite) but the same device and same gain level was employed for all measurements in each subject. Echodensity was quantified using gray scale histogram analysis of the diaphragm region traced out on images (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda MD). The median grayscale value (range 0-255) was log-transformed to yield a normal distribution of echodensity values. Intraobserver repeatability on multiple images obtained on the same day was assessed in 30 patients. The evolution of diaphragm echodensity over time relative to each patient's baseline value was compared according to initial change in diaphragm thickness, maximal thickening fraction, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 176 echodensity measurements were obtained in 37 mechanically ventilated patients (mean 3.57, SD 0.61). Intra-observer repeatability for echodensity measurements on sequential images was acceptable (limits of agreement \u00b10.36, \u00b112%). Echodensity values varied according to ultrasound gain but not according to ultrasound device or imaging depth. Mean echodensity at baseline in mechanically ventilated patients was not significantly different from healthy subjects (Figure 1 , p=0.20); although in 41% of mechanically ventilated patients echodensity exceeded the 95 th percentile in healthy subjects (3.8) . Baseline echodensity was unrelated to age, sex, severity of illness, organ dysfunction, chronic comorbidity, or sepsis. The early evolution of echodensity differed according to patient outcomes. In patients who required less than 7 days of ventilation, echodensity tended to decrease during the first 4 days of the study, whereas it tended to increase in patients who required more than 7 days (Figure 2A) . Similarly, echodensity tended to decrease in patients who exhibited higher maximal thickening fraction after 1 week of ventilation whereas it tended to increase in patients who exhibited impaired maximal thickening fraction ( Figure 2B ). The evolution of diaphragm echodensity was unrelated to changes in diaphragm thickness over time ( Figure 2C ) or to variations in SOFA score and sepsis. Echodensity tended to increase over time at increasing inspiratory effort levels (diaphragm thickening > 30%, p=0.02). Conclusions: Diaphragm echodensity can be measured with reasonable precision in mechanically ventilated patients. Increases in echodensity during the early course of ventilation are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Echodensity may be a useful biomarker of diaphragm injury.

Initiated by 2 bedside nurses to improve the sense of humanity in a critical care encounter, the Footprints Project was developed to share a patient's personal information during critical illness. The project includes a Footprints Form completed by family members to capture personal information about patients, some of which is transcribed onto a Footprints Whiteboard by the bedside in each patient's room. This mixed-methods multi-phase project aims to facilitate more holistic patient-centered critical care. The objective of this qualitative phase was to understand the impact of the Footprints Project on the experience of clinicians working in the ICU. Methods: With 35 ICU clinicians, we conducted 10 semi-structured interviews (10 clinicians) and 5 focus groups (25 clinicians) 18 months after the Footprints Project was implemented. Focus groups and interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymized. Transcripts were analyzed by 4 team members using conventional content analysis. Codes were developed through periodic consensus meetings and organized into categories and themes once coding was completed. Results: Our sample included 13 bedsides nurses, 1 charge nurse, 4 physiotherapists, 2 respiratory therapists, 2 chaplains, 1 unit clerk and 12 physicians (5 fellows, 4 residents and 3 intensivists). Clinicians described using information found on the Footprints Form and Whiteboard as a 'conversation-starter' for talking with patients and families, and as an aid for difficult discussions about prognosis. Main themes identified in this qualitative analysis included: Enhancing Initial Communication, Informing Clinical Interventions, Promoting Interprofessional Collaboration, Facilitating Meaningful Relationships with Patients and Families, and Fostering Culture Change within the ICU. Clinicians reported using the Footprints Form and Whiteboard for diverse purposes, with several beneficial consequences. Sentiments about the untapped potential for the Footprints Project encouraged its more intentional use as a communication tool for both families and clinicians. Conclusions: The Footprints Project is a non-digital initiative in the fast-paced ICU which influences clinicians in a myriad of ways, helping them to connect with patients and families, and colleagues, while having a positive influence on the culture of the ICU. Introduction: Frailty denotes the loss of functional reserve capacity and is prevalent in approximately 30% of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Frailty is a multidimensional construct with important prognostic implications, but may be difficult to capture and measure in critically ill patients. The 9-point judgement-based Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a validated clinical tool that has been used in many settings to screen for frailty. The CFS may be a useful risk stratification instrument that can help to predict the chance of adverse outcomes for critically ill patients. In 2 ICU studies, frailty has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, increased length of hospital stay and adverse hospital outcomes. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of CFS scores generated by research coordinators (RC) via chart review for critically ill patients. We used the CFS as a dichotomous variable, whereby frail was defined as a CFS score > 5 and non-frail was defined as a CFS score <5. Methods: In a prospective 2-center cohort study, we enrolled patients \u226518 years of age admitted to 2 ICUs in Hamilton, Canada for <24h. The RC generated CFS scores using 3 steps: 1) chart review, 2) family interview (if possible), and 3) patient interview (if possible). Subsequently, based on all accumulated data, the RC generated an overall impression captured in a Final CFS. Length of stay and vital status for both ICU and hospital discharge were recorded for all patients. Results: Of 336 patients screened, 150 patients were enrolled. 70 patients (46.7%) were identified as having pre-hospital frailty based on the initial chart review. The mean age of the frail cohort was significantly greater than those who were not frail (68.0 \u00b1 11.8 v. 60.1 \u00b117.2, p=0.002). Both frail and non-frail patients had similar mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores (22.5 \u00b1 7.7 v. 20.4 \u00b1 6.9, p=0.09). In the frail cohort, 50% (n=35) of the patients were female, compared to 31% in the non-frail cohort (n=25). Frailty was not associated with a significantly increased length of ICU stay (1.01 days, p=0.58) or hospital stay (3.60 days, p=0.24) using median regression analyses. Frailty was associated with a trend toward increased risk of ICU mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.29, 95% CI: 0.60-2.78, p=0.51) and in hospital mortality (HR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.58-2.17, p=0.073), after adjusting for APACHE II score, use of mechanical ventilation and inotropes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background and Objectives:"}, {"text": "Although not statistically significant, frail patients had a higher risk of ICU and hospital mortality compared to their non-frail counterparts, after adjusting for illness severity. These preliminary data suggest that CFS scores used in an ICU setting may provide useful information that could help to guide conversations with families of critically ill patients, as well as being useful for clinical ICU research. Introduction: The ICU management of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is challenging, due in part to the severity of the underlying insult, competing systemic injuries, and unpredictable clinical course. Even with specialist management in dedicated critical care settings, morbidity and mortality from this condition remains high. Complex care decisions in SAH management may be simplified with the use of standardized management protocols (SMPs), which provide clinicians with an algorithm to guide patient care. However, despite their postulated benefit, it is currently unknown if SMPs are associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with SAH. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review to determine whether the use of SMPs is associated with improved outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU with non-traumatic SAH. Primary outcomes included mortality at 6 months or greater and neurologic outcome at hospital discharge and follow-up. Secondary outcomes included length of stay in hospital, duration of mechanical ventilation, rates of aneurysm rebleeding and vasospasm, and healthcare costs. We additionally assessed the quality of the published literature in this domain with a validated grading tool. Methods: We developed comprehensive search strategies for MEDLINE, EMBASE, WoS, CINAHL, and CENTRAL to identify studies for inclusion. We also scanned the gray literature and reviewed published abstracts from relevant conference proceedings to locate further potential material. Our search yielded 9,585 articles, of which 9,151 were excluded by title and abstract screening. 404 studies were reviewed in full, and 15 observational studies were selected for final inclusion. Information on study design, baseline characteristics, and patient outcomes was extracted from each article into a pre-piloted data collection form and aggregated for analysis. Study quality was assessed according to a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: Most studies presented either a descriptive pathway or a flow diagram, with the majority of SMPs addressing the ICU management of delayed cerebral ischemia and corresponding vasospam. Of the 15 studies, 9 did not include a control group. 5 of these studies assessed functional outcomes but did not report them according to a recognized performance scale. 3 studies did not specify when they measured one or more of their primary outcomes. A total of 6 studies assessed SMP-related outcomes against a control group; 5 of these 6 studies showed statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in one or more primary or secondary outcomes in the protocol-managed group. Only 2 studies reported level of adherence to the SMP. Overall study quality varied significantly based on NOS grading. Meta-analysis of the data was not possible given the dearth of studies meeting our inclusion criteria.

The 3 Wishes Project has become the 3 Wishes Program, an interdisciplinary collaboration of frontline staff, spiritual care clinicians, and the research team, who together deliver personalized end-of-life care for most decedents. Accordingly, the number of patients enrolled increased 4-fold, and the number of wishes increased 6-fold; from 20 patients and 76 wishes in 2013 to 81 patients and 443 wishes in 2016. The most common wish category in 2013 was providing food and beverages (26.9%) while in 2016 it was humanizing the environment (15.2%). The most common 4 wish categories implemented in 2013 accounted for the majority of wishes implemented (67.2%), while in 2016 these 4 categories accounted for less than half of wishes implemented (49.7%). A wider portfolio of wishes in a broader array of categories was implemented over time, demonstrating diverse ways in which patients dying in the ICU can be honoured. Conclusions: In this interprofessional end-of-life program, wish categories have evolved and expanded over 4 years.

We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the predictive accuracy of neuroimaging in this context. Methods: We searched Medline (database inception-December 2016) to retrieve studies of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict poor neurological outcome in adult (>16 years) cardiac arrest survivors. We extracted methodological and outcomes data in duplicate and summarized the test performance using meta-analyses based on bivariate model where possible and univariate models otherwise. Results: From 3046 citations, 32 included studies examined CT (n=15) or MRI (n=17) in a mean of 76 (range 9 to 283) patients. Twelve studies calculated the grey:white matter ratio (GWR) of Hounsfield units.

M.Sc ; Morrison Laurie J. MD, M.ScIntroduction: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection(1). Early recognition and intervention are critical to improve patient outcomes(2). In modern healthcare systems, paramedics often encounter patients with sepsis before other clinicians, offering an important opportunity for even earlier sepsis care(3). Objective: We sought to estimate the incidence and examine clinical and operational characteristics of patients with infection or sepsis who are transported by paramedics in a Canadian Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. Methods: A one-year cohort of all EMS transport events in the province of Alberta, Canada was linked to in-hospital administrative databases. Infection and sepsis were identified using administrative Emergency Department (ED) diagnosis codes and EMS clinical information, consistent with recommendations from the Sepsis-3 definition(1). Clinical characteristics (e.g. age, sex, vital signs), operational factors (e.g. prehospital encounter time), and treatments provided by paramedics (e.g. intravenous[IV] fluid treatment) were evaluated in patients with infection or sepsis, and compared to those of other patients transported by paramedics. Results: The incidence of infections (10%) and sepsis (2.1%) are notable within the paramedic-transported adult patient population, with more than half (56%) of these patients requiring admission to hospital. Fever (greater than 37.8 C) on presentation to paramedics was somewhat uncommon among patients with infections (17%), however, altered mental status (24.6%) and tachypnea (greater than 22 breaths per minute; 31.6%) were more common. Compared to other patients transported by paramedics, patients with sepsis were generally older (mean 75 vs. 60 years), female (56.4%) and more frequently had altered vital signs, most commonly altered Glasgow Coma Score (less than 15; 61%), tachypnea (48%), low oxygen saturation (less than 90%; 34%), or fever (24.5%). Patients with sepsis were more likely to have a high priority dispatch (38% vs. 31%), but also had longer prehospital intervals (mean 44 min vs. 39 min, p<0.001) despite shorter transport distances (mean 15 km vs. 16 km, p=0.004). IV lines were initiated in 55% of septic patients compared to 34% of non-septic patients. In septic patients with a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg, 70% received an IV but only 26% of those patients received at least 500 mL of fluid before arriving in the ED. The in-hospital mortality rate for paramedic-transported patients with infection or sepsis was 6.6% and 19%, respectively. Conclusion: Infections and sepsis are common among paramedic-transported patients, and paramedics spend a considerable time with these patients prior to arriving in the ED. These patients frequently have altered vital signs, suggesting earlier recognition is feasible. The in-hospital mortality of these patients is high, supporting the need to study earlier interventions provided in the prehospital setting.The Evolution of Diaphragm Echodensity During the Early Course of Mechanical Ventilation Differs According to the Eventual Duration of VentilationRiegler, Stephen E 1 ; McClelland, William 1 ; Lee, Misan 1,2 ; Vorona, Stefannie 1 ; Dres, Martin 3 ; Reid, Darlene 4 ; Brochard, Laurent J 5,6 ; Ferguson, Niall D 1,5,7,8 ; Goligher, Ewan C 1,5 . 1 Department of Medicine, Division of Respirology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada; 2 Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Canada; 3 Respiratory and Critical Care Department, Groupe Hospitalier Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e9re Charles Foix, Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Paris, France; 4 Department of Physical Therapy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 5 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 6 Keenan Centre for Biomedical Research, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada; 7 Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; 8 Institute for Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF33": {"text": "The Impact of Delayed Source Control and Antimicrobial Therapy in 196 Patients with Cholecystitis-Associated Septic ShockDivision of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada; 2 Division of Critical Care Medicine and Gastroenterology/Hepatology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB Canada; 3 Section of Critical Care Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada; 4 Section of Infectious Diseases, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Background: Cholecystitis-associated septic shock carries significant mortality. Treatment includes early administration of antimicrobial therapy along with source control (cholecystectomy or percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage). There is uncertainty regarding the most appropriate time to achieve source control. Our aim was to determine whether timing of source control affects survival in cholecystitis patients with septic shock. Methods: Nested retrospective cohort study of all cholecystitis-associated septic shock patients (met Tokyo guidelines for cholecystitis along with hypotension requiring vasopressors) from an international, multicenter database between 1996 and 2015. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine associations between practice related factors (delay to source control and antibiotics) and severity of illness on in-hospital mortality. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to evaluate the interaction between nonlinear covariates. Results: Among 196 patients (mean age 69 years, 70% male), overall mortality was 37%. Compared to non-survivors (n=72), survivors (n=124) had lower mean admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores (21 vs. 27, p<0.001) and lower median admission serum lactate (2.4 vs. 6.8 \u03bcmol/L, p<0.001). Survivors were more likely to receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy earlier (median 2.8 vs. 6.1 hours from shock, p=0.012). Survivors were also more likely to undergo successful source control earlier (median 9.8 vs. 24.7 hours, p<0.001). Adjusting for covariates, APACHEII [Odds ratio (OR) 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.21) per increment] and delayed source control >16 hours [OR 4.45 (1.88-10.70)] were independently associated with increased mortality (p<0.001 for all; c-statistic 0.800). CART analysis demonstrated patients with APACHEII of 15 to 26 benefitted most from source control within 16 hours (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Patients with cholecystitis-associated septic shock have significant mortality. Admission APACHEII score and delay in source control >16 hours significantly affected hospital outcomes. This suggests urgent source control (within 16 hours) could improve outcomes in high-risk patients.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF34": {"text": "Table 1.

There is limited evidence that MV strategies used in the general ICU population are well suited to pregnancy. Existing data are insufficient to make recommendations on how MV should be modified for the critically ill pregnant woman.Parenchymal ICP catheter use, n(%) 26 Introduction: Ventilator-associated respiratory tract infections are a cause of morbidity and mortality in children with a tracheostomy. In addition, they cause greater exposition to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The use of inhaled antibiotics as a preventive measure to reduce ventilator-associated infections has not been studied in children with a tracheostomy. Objectives: To determine if the use of preventive inhaled antibiotics in this population reduces the risk of acquired respiratory tract infections and reduces exposition to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Methods: A retrospective study was performed by reviewing charts of all patients aged between 0 to 18 years old with a tracheostomy, hospitalised at the CHU Sainte Justine between January 2004 and November 2016 and treated with inhaled antibiotics as a preventive measure. The primary outcome was exposition to broadspectrum antibiotics in the 3-month period before and after the beginning of the preventive treatment with inhaled antibiotics. Adverse effects were also evaluated. Results: Six patients (median age: 10.0 months, interquartile: 8.3-11.0) were included in our analysis. One of them received colimycin, 3 received tobramycin and 2 were treated with both alternately. The median time of treatment was 74 days (69-161). Patients were exposed to broad spectrum antibiotics during 18 days (5-31) in the 3 months preceding the treatment versus 2 days (0-3) in the 3 months following the treatment initiation, p= 0,115 (Wilcoxon). The number of respiratory tract infections went from 2 (1-3) to 1 (0-1) during the same periods, p=0,066. Adverse effects most commonly reported were cough (n=2) and increased respiratory secretions post-inhalation (n=4). No new colonisation with antibiotics-resistant bacteria was observed in the 12 following months. Conclusion: Although limited by the small sample size, these results support the design of future studies to evaluate the potential clinical impact of preventive inhaled antibiotics in children with a tracheostomy. (9, 22) . Prior to CDI, 110 (99.1%) patients received at least one antibiotic for a median of 11 days (7, 18) ; 108 (97.3%) received proton pump inhibitors and 14 (12.6%) received histamine-2 receptor antagonists. ICU and hospital mortality were 21.6% (n=24) and 33.3% (n=37), respectively. ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 16 days (10,31) and 39 days (24,77), respectively. CDI recurred in 20 patients (18.0%). Hospital mortality for patients with non-severe vs severe CDI according to these 3 illness severity criteria were: ACG: 23.0% (14/61) vs. 46.0 %, (23/50), p=0.01; SHEA/IDSA: 19.0% (8/42) vs 42.0% (29/69), p=0.01; and ESCMID: 26.6% (17/64) vs 42.6% (20/47), p=0.08 (Table 1) . Conclusions: In this 3-center study, almost all patients with ICU-acquired CDI received invasive mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors. ACG and SHEA/IDSA severity criteria may be useful for stratifying patients with ICU-acquired CDI based on the risk of death in hospital.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 361, "end": 363, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2404, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2408, "text": "22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2506, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2510, "text": "18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3082, "end": 3091, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Conclusion:"}]}
