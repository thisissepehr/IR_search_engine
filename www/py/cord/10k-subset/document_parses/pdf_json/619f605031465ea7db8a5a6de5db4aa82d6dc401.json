The median overall survival, however, was approximately 9 months for the entire cohort. Multivariate analysis showed that patients who were of <53 years of age and achieved CR after SCT had the best survival outcome as half of these patients were alive at 5 years (Fig. 4) . One third of the patients in this study did not appear to benefit from TBI-MEL, and four died within the first 2 months following the transplant. The limited sample size precludes any definitive conclusions relating to risk factors predictive of disease response; however, in this series, younger age and remission status following SCT appeared to be associated with overall survival and warrant further investigation. Given the high probability of achieving CR in patients with fewer than three lines of prior cytotoxic therapy, TBI-MEL conditioning can be offered to patients with nonremission hematologic malignancies who are less than 53 years of age and not heavily pretreated (<3 lines) with reasonable confidence. The risk factors identified for transplant outcomes in this cohort may not be generalizable to all transplant patients with relapsed/refractory disease since our results reflect the effect of a new regimen, TBI-MEL in this particular cohort. While caution must be exercised in interpreting these results due to a small sample size, multivariate analysis showed that durable remission was possible in 60 % of our patients with platelet counts greater than 80,000/\u03bcL and LDH less than 500 IU/L at the time of SCT. Of note, high LDH levels (>500 IU/L) at the time of transplant was a stronger predictor of relapse than a low platelet count. Whether these pretransplant predictors of LDH and platelet count having a general utility will require larger multicenter studies evaluating this regimen. Another potential predictor of relapse was the presence of circulating malignant cells at the time of SCT, although we could not demonstrate a significant difference in RFS (p =0.08) and OS (p =0.06) between patients with and without circulating blasts. We suspect that this was probably due to small sample size. The median survival time of patients with circulating blasts was notably shorter (3 vs. 10.8 months) as compared to those without circulating blast at stem cell transplantation (SCT).
