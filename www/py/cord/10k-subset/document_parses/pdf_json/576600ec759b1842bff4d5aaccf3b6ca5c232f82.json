What are the regulatory mechanisms that ensure proper timing and coordination of events during the cell cycle? Biochemical and genetic screens have identifi ed a number of cell-cycle regulators, and it was recognized early on that many of the genes encoding cell-cycle regulators, including cyclins, were transcribed only in distinct phases of the cell cycle. Thus, \"just in time\" expression is likely an important part of the mechanism that maintains the proper temporal order of cell cycle events. New high-throughput technologies for measuring transcript levels have revealed that a large percentage of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome (~20 %) is cell cycle regulated. Similarly, a substantial fraction of the mammalian transcriptome is cell cycle-regulated. Over the past 25 years, many studies have been undertaken to determine how gene expression is regulated during the cell cycle. In this review, we discuss contemporary models for the control of cell cycle-regulated transcription, and how this transcription program is coordinated with other cell cycle events in S. cerevisiae . In addition, we address the genomic approaches and analytical methods that enabled contemporary models of cell cycle transcription.

Historically, the cell cycle has been divided into four phases-Gap 1 (G1), Synthesis (S), Gap 2 (G2), and Mitosis (M)-that describe the chronological order of different events observed in normally cycling cells. The bulk of duplication and segregation events occur in S and M phases. During S phase, both DNA and centrosomes are duplicated (Fig. 1 ) . Duplicated centrosomes separate in order to form the poles of the mitotic spindle responsible for segregating sister chromatids ( Fig. 1 ). Sister chromatid segregation is initiated during M phase, or mitosis ( Fig. 1 ). G1 and G2 were termed \"gap\" phases, as they separate the visibly observable events of S and M phase. Although no overt cellular changes or events are observed during G1 and G2, cells are interpreting signals from their extracellular and intracellular environments to ensure that conditions are appropriate for cellular division events. In early G1, cells interpret extracellular signals (e.g., nutrient abundance, mating pheromone) to decide whether to commit to a new cell cycle. Following this point of commitment (called START in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), cells prepare for entry into S phase by activating the expression of genes required for duplicating DNA and centrosomes (Fig. 1 ). In G2, cells interpret intracellular signals from checkpoint pathways that monitor whether duplication events have been completed with fi delity, and whether the mitotic spindle apparatus is functional.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 510, "end": 519, "text": "(Fig. 1 )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 652, "end": 658, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 733, "end": 739, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1431, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Each cell cycle event-such as DNA replication, centrosome duplication, and chromosome segregation-is a complex process that requires the coordination of many different proteins acting together to complete the task at hand.

Over the past three decades, an overwhelming number of studies have identifi ed and characterized two proteins that act in a complex to trigger cell cycle events: cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Both biochemical and genetic approaches have shown that, throughout the cell cycle, CDKs are activated by different cyclins, whose role is to activate and inhibit different events at the proper time and in the proper order (reviewed in [ 1 -3 ] ).

Whether it is a single budding yeast or a population of cells that form tissues in an organism, active cellular division occurs during only a portion of a cell's overall life cycle. Microorganisms are subject to environmental constraints and will divide when conditions (nutrients, temperature, growth factor signaling, etc.) permit, but not when the local environment is not amenable to cell division. Therefore, much of the life of a single cell is spent outside the cell cycle, in a state of rest or quiescence.

In order to understand how this is done, we need to understand the transcriptional regulators. As more and more transcripts were identifi ed as periodic during the cell cycle, focus turned to the regulators that activated or inhibited transcription-transcription factors (TFs). To identify the regulators that control activation or repression of periodic transcription in budding yeast, researchers utilized genetic tools, promoter sequence information, and physical localization studies [ 37 -39 ] . Not surprisingly, a number of TFs were found to regulate distinct subsets of periodic genes throughout the cell cycle (reviewed in [ 9 -11 , 33 ] ).

First, many of the TFs that play a role in controlling cell cycle-regulated transcription are themselves periodically transcribed (reviewed in [ 11 ] ). For TFs that act in complexes, at least one TF is periodically expressed. This observation suggests that a portion of genes may be cell cycle-regulated due to the periodic expression of their regulators. Second, cyclin/CDK activity has been found to affect the activity of many of these transcription factors. In these cases, cyclins that are expressed during any of these phases have the capacity to affect TF activity (Table 1 ) . Additionally, this regulation can be either activating or inhibitory depending on the TF (Table 1 ) . These fi ndings, coupled with cyclin deletion experiments, imply that cell cycle-regulated gene expression is also modulated by cyclin/CDK activity [ 40 -42 ] . Finally, genome-wide binding data have shown that these TFs also bind to the promoters of other TFs shown to regulate periodic gene expression [ 8 , 43 , 44 ] . In fact, TFs expressed late in the cell cycle have been shown to bind to the promoters of TFs responsible for early periodic gene expression [ 45 ] . This fi nding demonstrates that the TFs controlling the last wave of periodic transcription may also activate the fi rst TFs in the following cycle. Taken together with global views of transcript dynamics from microarray experiments [ 7 ] , it was proposed that a TF network could account for the periodic nature of the TFs themselves and the entire periodic transcription program ( [ 8 , 44 ] , reviewed in [ 9 -11 ] ). Models for how the TF network is integrated with cyclin/ CDK activity and cell cycle events will be discussed below. Several versions of TF networks that control cell cycle-regulated transcription have been proposed [ 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 44 ] .

With the introduction of these technologies to RNA-Seq, the biases of amplifi cation-based methods should be greatly reduced.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 154, "text": "[ 71 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 272, "end": 283, "text": "[ 81 , 82 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 621, "end": 632, "text": "[ 83 , 84 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1121, "text": "[ 85 , 86 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gaps in Knowledge and the Future"}, {"text": "While great advances have been made in removing artifacts and biases from microarray and sequencing methods, they do not address a main concern that many researchers harbor: the fact that these methods detect average transcript levels in a population. To eliminate this problem, many have made use of RNA fl uorescence in situ hybridization, or RNA-FISH [ 87 ] . RNA-FISH uses a fl uorophore-conjugated nucleotide probe to detect target RNAs in fi xed cells. The foci generated by the probe are visualized by microscopy, and each focus represents an mRNA contained within a cell at that moment. Barcoding FISH probes and ultraresolution microscopy has lead to the potential for identifying and quantifying more transcripts than available fl uorophore colors [ 88 , 89 ] . Using RNA-FISH, one can determine the actual number of transcripts at a time point in a single cell. Observing multiple cells, one can determine the range of transcript abundance at a given time in a collection of single cells, which helps understand the distribution of RNA abundance in a population in a way that cannot be determined using methods that rely on purifi ed RNA from a population of cells (microarray, RNA-seq, etc.).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 360, "text": "[ 87 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 758, "end": 769, "text": "[ 88 , 89 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gaps in Knowledge and the Future"}, {"text": "The drawbacks to this method are also inherent to working with single cells. For each time point, many cells must be labeled and analyzed to obtain statistically signifi cant results. Furthermore, the method requires cells to be fi xed. Hence, transcript dynamics cannot be measured in the same cells over a period of time. Therefore, a time course using an RNA-FISH approach still samples a population, albeit in a manner that allows for individual mRNA molecules to be quantifi ed.

These methods rely on inserting hairpin-forming sequences to the noncoding regions of the mRNA. These hairpin constructs are recognized by virus-derived hairpin-recognition proteins. The best characterized of these systems is the MS2 reporter [ 91 , 92 ] . The hairpin-binding protein domain can be detected as they are typically fused to a fl uorescent reporter. MS2 stem-loop repeats are integrated into the mRNA of interest and co-expressed in a cell with the bacteriophage derived MS2-binding protein fused to a fl uorescent reporter. When the mRNA is expressed, the stem-loop structures fold and are recognized by the MS2-binding domain, generating fl uorescent foci that can be tracked within a living cell.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 123, "text": "[ 90 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 369, "end": 380, "text": "[ 91 , 92 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gaps in Knowledge and the Future"}, {"text": "The system was originally described in yeast, where it was used to follow ASH1 mRNA as it was traffi cked from the nucleus to the bud [ 93 ] . Since the introduction of the system, it has been effectively used in a variety of eukaryotes and expanded to a two-color system [ 94 , 95 ] . Still, live-cell imaging using reporters has typically shied away from quantitation and has been used more extensively for localization experiments. The RNA hairpin-binding approach is, so far, relatively unproven in systems where mRNA levels are dynamically regulated over time (though some efforts have been made to quantify mRNA by foci in prokaryotes [ 96 , 97 ] ). For example, the ASH1 experiment described above observed mRNA localization dynamics, not abundance. A major limitation of probing mRNAs by FISH or by hairpin-binding proteins is the introduction of bias to the analysis while limiting scale. Using these methods, an experimenter can only determine the transcript levels of the specifi c mRNAs that they have targeted for analysis. Therefore, examining correlation or coherence with other transcripts is not yet possible with this approach. In time, the ability to multiplex probes may expand the experimental arsenal of probe targets. Certainly, with advances in fl uorescent probe development and live cell imaging, the potential remains for RNA binding probes to yield fruitful results in the fi eld of cell cycle transcription.
