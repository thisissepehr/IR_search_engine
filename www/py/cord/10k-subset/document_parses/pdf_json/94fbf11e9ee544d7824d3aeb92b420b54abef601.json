Neutropenia was only found in 8/ 22 (36%) cases, and recurrent infections, the most important clinical problem in Western patients, were not observed. None of our cases presented with rheumatoid arthritis. These clinical features were consistently observed when compared with the 88 other Asian patients. Combined data from our cohort and other Asian cases showed that Asian patients, compared with Western patients, had more frequent anemia (66/110, 60% versus 113/240, 47%; p=0.044), attributable to a much higher incidence of PRCA (52/110, 47% versus 6/143, 4%; p<0.001).

Therefore, if Asian patients had been included in Western studies, they would have been the minority. Because of the small number of Asian patients reported in the literature, we elected to include even single case reports in this study so that a reasonable number of patients could be reviewed.

However, when patients present with anemia without obvious LGL lymphocytosis, T-LGL leukemia may not be immediately obvious. We routinely performed flow cytometry and analysis for TCR gene rearrangement for patients presenting with unexplained cytopenia(s), which enabled us to detect more subtle cases of T-LGL leukemia.

With recognition of the importance of PRCA as a cause of anemia in T-LGL leukemia, increasing numbers of cases were reported worldwide. By 2001, PRCA has been established as a consistent albeit infrequent complication of T-LGL leukemia in Western patients [38] . In fact, T-LGL leukemia is now regarded to surpass all other pathologies as the commonest cause of PRCA [3, 38] . The high frequency of PRCA in our cases (68%) and other Asian patients (42%) is in sharp contrast to the very low frequency of PRCA at 4% in the Western patients reviewed here.

Although the cause of neutropenia in T-LGL leukemia remains obscure, it has been postulated that LGL leukemic cells expressed FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 [39] . TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 up-regulated Fas expression on myeloid progenitors, which were then induced into apoptosis by the FasL-expressing LGL leukemic cells [39] . Interestingly, these mechanisms overlap with those involved in the neutropenia typically found in rheumatoid arthritis complicated by Felty syndrome. In the latter disease, humoral mediated mechanisms also contribute to shortened neutrophil survival. The shared mechanisms of neutrophil suppression in T-LGL leukemia and Felty syndrome have led to the premise that both disorders might be part of the spectrum of a similar disease process [39] .

Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases might provide the antigenic stimuli in Western patients [43] . In Asian patients, however, PRCA is the most common complication. LGL leukemic cells with cytotoxic activity against red cell precursors has been postulated to occur in Asian patients [44] . Therefore, it is conceivable that in Asian patients, antigenic stimuli related to erythropoiesis could be involved in T-LGL leukemia associated with PRCA.

However, disease relapse often occurs once treatment is stopped, so that it has been suggested that treatment should continue indefinitely once a response is obtained [3] .

The efficacy of cyclophosphamide in T-LGL leukemia related PRCA is uncertain [28] . In the Asian patients reviewed here, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine therapy was effective in some patients. We have previously reported that the purine analogue fludarabine together with mitoxantrone and dexamethasone resulted in high remission rates in Chinese T-LGL leukemia patients [9] . Updated results presented here showed that complete remission was maintained in five of 13 fludarabine-treated patients for a median follow-up exceeding 4 years. The advantages of this approach include a finite duration of treatment and the obviation of maintenance therapy. Fludarabine was combined with mitoxantrone and dexamethasone as it is less active as a single agent than in combination regimens. Furthermore, fludarabine as a single agent had been reported to only improve the cytopenias in T-LGL leukemia without eradicating the leukemic clone [46] and fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide only induced partial remissions in Western T-LGL leukemia patients [32] . Fludarabine combination regimens offers the possibility of a durable remission without maintenance, as opposed to the daunting prospect of indefinite treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. Finally, the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab has also been used in T-LGL leukemia with variable success [31, 47, 48] .
