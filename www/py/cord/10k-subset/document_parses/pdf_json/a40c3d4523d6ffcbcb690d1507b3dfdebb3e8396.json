However, seropositive rates remained above 90% at day 182 and above 70% at day 385 in all adjuvanted groups, compared with 50.0% and 22.6% in the nonadjuvanted group and 4.5% and 1.9% in the placebo group. In addition, recent studies seem to suggest that a robust immune response to the HA head and stalk domains, as measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, may be induced even in the absence of HI and MN response [27] , so the clinical relevance of the decline in antibody titers is not clear. The observed kinetics of the immune response in adjuvanted groups in our study is similar to that elicited by other influenza vaccines, in particular the adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines [28] , for which a strong anamnestic response was elicited by a heterologous booster dose, up to 3 years after priming [29, 30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 215, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 788, "end": 792, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1579, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1835, "end": 1839, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1958, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1962, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The H7N9 AS03-adjuvanted vaccine was generally well tolerated.

Formulation of pandemic vaccines with an effective adjuvant is an accepted strategy to accomplish both goals [33] and to ensure adequate immunogenicity for the elderly and those with reduced immune responsiveness due to concurrent illness. The assessment of immunogenicity for this study is based on HI and MN assays; no additional evaluation such as cellmediated immunity was performed which could bring additional information but for which no regulatory acceptance criteria have been established. No formal comparisons between adjuvanted vaccine groups were performed, and analyses were descriptive. These could constitute potential limitations to the study.
