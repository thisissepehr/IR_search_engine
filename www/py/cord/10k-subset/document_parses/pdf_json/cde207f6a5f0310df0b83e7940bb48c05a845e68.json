At that time, she was hospitalized, treated with intravenous steroids, and was diagnosed with allergies to cow's milk, chicken egg and peanuts. Due to food allergies and frequent respiratory tract infections, her parents decided not to send her to a kindergarten. When the girl was 5-year-old, allergy tests did not confirm allergies to cow's milk and chicken egg anymore; however, specific IgE against peanuts were still present in high titers. One year later, she started attending an organized pre-school learning. She used to eat homemade meals only. At the age of nine years, she participated in the school camp -her first fully independent trip. She was equipped with an adrenaline auto-injector. The girl was educated and aware of her illness, and she avoided consuming peanuts. Despite that, once at home, she ate three pieces of chocolate labelled with a warning 'may contain peanuts'. After a few minutes, she developed stomach ache and dyspnea. Her father immediately administered her 0.15 mg of adrenaline intramuscularly, but she lost consciousness. Her neighbour, who was a paramedic, administered another dose of 0.15 mg of adrenalin from auto-injector and started resuscitation. The ambulance and emergency helicopter arrived within a few minutes. The child was intubated, chest compressions were carried out, and adrenaline, hydrocortisone and calcium chloride were administered intravenously. The girl regained consciousness for a short period of time. However, while she was being transported to the hospital, she again went into a cardiac arrest and despite 2.5 hour long resuscitation, she died. The postmortem report suggested anaphylaxis as the cause of her death.",

Predisposing factors for anal protrusions are stiff shunt tube, thin bowel wall with strong peristalsis in infants, malnutrition, infection and foreign body reaction. Exaggerated peristalsis in diarrhea can predispose to en-masse protrusion of shunt coils. Redundant sigmoid colon is the most favorable site for shunt erosion and subsequent anal protrusion. Abdominal X-ray does not show pneumoperitoneum because shunt perforations are usually concealed. Anal protrusion of shunt without peritonitis is treated by percutaneous division and removal of the cranial end, and the peritoneal end is pulled out through the anus [3, 5] . The perforation is usually sealed by a chronic fibrous sheath around the shunt track, and laparotomy is usually not required [3, 5] . 3.

This, in turn, may generate fresh insight into the genetic markers of childhood psychosis. VOLUME 53 __ AUGUST 15, 2016 CORRESPONDENCE Cherubism is a rare genetic disorder with approximately 300 cases reported worldwide. The disorder typically begins in children at ages of 2-7 years affecting males and females with equal frequency [1] . The lesions usually first appear symmetrically in the angle of mandible; rarely involvement of condyles and zygomatic arches has been reported. Lesions are limited to the jaws, and in most cases begin to regress with the onset of puberty. Respiratory problems due to backward displacement of tongue or obliteration of the nasal airway may manifest as upper airway obstruction. Extracranial involvement is extremely rare.

In acute respiratory illness, the milder lung disease may rapidly progress into diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities mixed with air space consolidation. Pleural effusion or chest X-ray was noted in only one of these cases [5] . Although, the extent of lung involvement can be better estimated with computed tomography, sequential chest radiographs have an additional advantage of estimation of the chest radiographic score and the chest radiographic deterioration score with an acceptable dose of radiation exposure to the individuals [2] . Due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms, the accurate and timely diagnosis of MERS-CoV in children can be challenging. However, heightened clinical suspicion in children with underlying risk factors living in endemic areas in conjunction with improved understanding of imaging findings have a great potential for optimal pediatric patient care.
