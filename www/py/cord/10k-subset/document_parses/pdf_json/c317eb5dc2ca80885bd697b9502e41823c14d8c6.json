            "text": "Alkaline earth (Ae = Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds continue to provide unprecedented observations for stoichiometric and catalytic bond activation. [1] Some of the most notable advances have been provided by kinetically-stabilized hydride derivatives. [2] The b-diketiminato calcium complex, [( Dipp BDI)CaH] 2 (1, Dipp BDI = HC{(Me)CNDipp} 2 ; Dipp = 2,6-i-Pr 2 C 6 H 3 ), for example, reacts with alkenes to provide n-alkyl derivatives, which are sufficiently reactive to effect even the nucleophilic alkylation of benzene. [3] These observations also impel the exploration of a broader range of Ae\u00c0 X bonded compounds. A topical case in point is provided by reports of the reactivity of b-diketiminato magnesium and calcium complexes with Roeskys similarly coordinated aluminium(I) species, [( Dipp BDI)Al] (2). [4] Compound 2 reacts with [( Dipp BDI)MgMe], [( Dipp BDI)MgH] 2 or [(TME-DA)MgI 2 ] to provide the Mg-Al bonded oxidative addition products (e.g., 3 and 4, Scheme 1). [5] [6] [7] In contrast, Harder has observed that addition of 2 to ( Dipp BDI)Ca-based reagents results in arene activation. While reaction with the ionic calcium complex [( Dipp BDI)Ca] + [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] \u00c0 provided two electron reduction of benzene, [8] addition of 1 to benzene or toluene solutions of 2 resulted in arene C\u00c0H activation and the production of [( Dipp BDI)Al(H)Ar] complexes (Scheme 1). [6] Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of this latter reactivity implicated an initial Ca \u00c0 Al bonded oxidative addition product, [( Dipp BDI)Al(H)Ca( Dipp BDI)] (5), which, although otherwise analogous to compound 4, is unobservable due to its rapid nucleophilic activation of the arene solvent.",

            "text": "While Scheme 1 highlights how the reactivity of a neutral Al I nucleophile may be augmented by the presence of a calcium center, other recent advances have illuminated a further pathway to the formation of group 2 alumanyl derivatives. Building on the earlier development of boryl and gallyl nucleophiles, [9] the groups of Aldridge, Goicoechea and Coles have extended the range of N-heterocyclic group 13centered anions to include the potassium alumanyl species, 6 and 7 (Figure 1 ). [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The formally monovalent aluminum centers in both compounds can behave as potent reducing agents or as aluminum-centered nucleophiles. Of most relevance to these studies, the potassium reagent 6 can activate the C\u00c0H or C\u00c0C bonds of benzene, and reacts with [( Mes BDI)MgI(OEt 2 )] ( Mes BDI = HC{(Me)CN-2,4,6- Me 3 C 6 H 2 } 2 ) to yield a further Mg\u00c0Al bonded complex, 8 ( Figure 1 ). [10, 12] In contrast to this recent development of magnesium alumanyl chemistry, the gallyl derivatives of Jones and co-workers, trans-[Ca{Ga[(DippNCR) 2 ]} 2 (THF) 4 ] (R = H, Me) and trans-[Ca{Ga(DippNCH)} 2 (TMEDA) 2 ], [15] provide the only examples of isolable compounds containing calcium-group 13 s-bonds and no calcium alumanyls have been considered beyond the implied intermediacy of species 5. [6] In this contribution, therefore, and as an extension to our recent interest in the reactivity of alkaline earth boryls, [16] we describe a seven-membered cyclic alumanyl anion and its use in the synthesis of a stable, yet highly reactive, calcium derivative.",

Filtration of the reaction mixture after 3 days at room temperature and removal of the volatile components gave a yellow powder, which crystallized from Et 2 O to provide crystals of [Al{SiN Dipp }K] 2 (12). The resultant 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectra were consistent with a symmetrical N,N'-chelated disposition of the diamide ligand about aluminum, a deduction confirmed by a subsequent single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis ( Figure 2 ). Like both the previously reported derivatives, 6 and 7, [10, 13] the asymmetric unit of compound 12 comprises two \"Al{SiN Dipp }K\" entities linked through flanking h 6 -K\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ar interactions [range 2.945(1)-3.026(1) ].

[7] Like 15, compound 16 contains a direct alkaline earth to aluminum bond (Figure 3 b) . Although the Al \u00c0 Ca bond length [3.1664(4) ] is 6.6 % longer than the sum of covalent radii of the metal centers, this distance is closely comparable with that calculated for the analogous intermetallic separation [3.120 ] Insight into the contrasting structures of 15 and 16 was provided by DFT calculations. [18] Both structures optimized to geometries close to those in the solid state, albeit with slightly overestimated metal-metal bond lengths (15, Mg\u00c0Al 2.85; 16, Ca-Al 3.25 ). Inspection of the localised Pipek-Mezey orbitals for compounds 15 and 16 (Figures 4 a,b ) emphasizes the polarization intrinsic to both the Al \u00c0 Mg and Al \u00c0 Ca sbonds. Although contributions from the aluminum centers dominate both orbitals, the charge distributions clearly reflect the greater ionic character of the Al\u00c0Ca interaction, an observation further underscored by the calculated NBO charges (15, Mg + 1.45 Al + 0.83; 16 Ca + 1.65, Al + 0.72 a.u.). Similarly, QTAIM plots of 15 and 16 identify bond critical points (BCPs) on both Ae \u00c0 Al bond paths (Figures 4 c,d) . The attributes of the BCP associated with the Al\u00c0Mg bond path [higher 1(r), 0.028 a.u. (15) versus 0.020 (16) and more negative H(r), \u00c00.008 a.u. (15) versus \u00c00.002 a.u. (16) ], however, are indicative of a marginally higher covalency between magnesium and aluminum than for the equivalent Al \u00c0 Ca interaction. Although compound 16 features a further bond path between the Ca center and a Dipp substituent of the {SiN Dipp }Al unit, this BCP is characterized by a very small 1(r) and small positive H(r). Similarly, analysis of the relevant NBOs of 16 (HOMO-8 and HOMO-10, Figure S37 ) and visualization of the analogous non covalent interaction (NCI) index ( Figure S39 ) indictate that this interaction is non-covalent in origin and only weakly stabilizing of the structure as a whole.",

While neither compound displays any observable reaction with benzene or toluene, and compound 15 is stable in ether solvents, addition of THF to a solution of compound 16 in methylcyclohexane resulted in [19] Similarly, compound 15 is unreactive toward 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene (COT), whilst addition of COT to compound 16 results in its two-electron aromatization and production of the asymmetric and heterobimetallic inverse sandwich species, compound 18 (Figure 5 b) . Although the chemistry of compounds 17, 18 and related derivatives will be discussed in detail elsewhere, these initial observations confirm that such heavier alkaline earth alumanyls, like group 2 organoderivatives, may provide a source of striking and unprecedented reactivity. We are continuing to elaborate these possibilities. ",

Both compounds 13 and 14 were isolated in high yields and their solidstate structures were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (Figures S16 and S20) as mononuclear species in which the tetraphenylborate anions interact with the Ae centers via polyhapto Ae\u00b7\u00b7m \u00c0 Ph \u00c0 B interactions.
