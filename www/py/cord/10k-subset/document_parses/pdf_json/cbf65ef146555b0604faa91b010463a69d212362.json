The twenty-first century has witnessed considerable advances in the understanding of the influenza viral pathogenesis, its synergy with bacterial infections and diagnostic methods. However, challenges continue: to find a less expensive and more reliable point-of-care test for use in developing countries, to produce more efficacious antiviral drugs, to explore ways to combat emerging antiviral resistance and to develop vaccines that can either be produced in a shorter production time or can overcome the need for annual matching with the circulating influenza strains. Most importantly for India, as a nation that suffered the highest mortality in the influenza pandemic 1918, there is an urgent need to gear up our existing preparedness for the next pandemic which is capable to hit at any moment in time.",

India was the focal point of this pandemic in terms of mortality with deaths between 10 and 20 million (about 8% of the population at that time). The epidemic in India originated in Bombay in September 1918 where the troops infected with influenza returned from the First World War [1] . Several pandemics have followed with lower mortality and morbidity in the years 1957 (Asian flu), 1968 (Hongkong flu) and 2009 (Swine flu) [2] . Despite the advances in diagnostics, antiviral drugs and vaccines the threat of a severe pandemic like 1918 looms large as the novel Influenza Aviruses of avian or swine origin continue to infect the humans.",

It is important to note that Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids via alpha 2,3 linkages present on alveolar type II cells and ocular epithelium [9] while human influenza viruses bind to 2,6 linked sialic acids present in the upper respiratory tract epithelium. Due to localisation of the human influenza virus mainly to the upper respiratory tract, there is greater risk of transmission of human influenza viruses than Avian flu [10] . However strains that are able to infect the lower respiratory tract cause more inflammation and severe complications. For example, H1N1 pandemic flu of 1918 was both highly transmissible as well as virulent, while the 2009 H1N1 was highly transmissible but had moderate virulence. As opposed, H5N1 and H7N9 have low transmissibility but high virulence [11] .",

M2 facilitates the virion entry into the host nucleus for replication. The Influenza A viruses carry 8 negative sense RNA segments. These negative sense RNAs therefore require RNA polymerase carried with the virus into the cell to be copied onto the template. Viral replication includes the stages of assembly, budding and scission. NA helps to release these newly formed virions which are either expelled through the tract by droplet secretions or infect other cells. In this manner the virus spreads from cell to cell. The immune response of the host's body to clear the virus can result in cell apoptosis. In severe cases necrosis of the alveolar epithelium can occur which clinically leads to acute respiratory distress. Either or both the impaired viral clearance and exaggerated host immune response can account for the severity of the illness [12] .",

When a sudden genetic reassortment takes place with a creation and introduction of a novel HA, NA or both segments from a zoonotoic reservoir into the currently circulating human viruses, it is called as an antigenic shift. This phenomenon occurs only in Influenza A. For example antigenic shift took place with swine H1N1 in 1918 then later to H2N2 in 1957 and to H3N2 in 1968 with reintroduction and co-circulation of H1N1 since 1977 [13] .

Varying efficacy of the antiviral drugs, increasing resistance of antivirals available and unavailability of parenteral formulations for use in severe patients are some of these challenges. Influenza A (H1N1) viruses resistant to Oseltamivir have been reported in children with higher frequency than adults due to relatively higher viral load [19] . The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) tested 27,000 H1N1 viruses from 2009 to 2011 and detected Oseltamivir resistance in 447 viruses [20] . Of these majority were reported from the Western Pacific region of the WHO. Fourteen percent were from patients who had not been exposed to Oseltamivir, indicating either a spontaneous neuraminase His275Tyr mutation or nosocomial acquisition of the resistant strain. Immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematological malignancies or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were noted to have the highest risk of Oseltamivir resistance because of suboptimal dosing during prophylaxis or disruption in treatment during viral replication [20] .",

It takes at least 6-8 mo for production of these vaccines. Moreover, the flu seasons are different in both hemispheres i.e., October-May in the northern hemisphere and May-October in the southern hemisphere. Therefore the matching process is completed twice a year, once each for the two hemispheres. Indian surveillance data suggest that, based on the geographical diversity of transmission dynamics, cities above 30\u00b0latitude (Srinagar) and those with late monsoon season (Chennai and Vellore) should have winter vaccination strategies, while rest of the country in May-June [6] .",

Since influenza primarily spreads by large particle droplet transmission, about 6 ft space surrounding the patient is considered infectious. All the body fluids of the patient are also considered infectious as indirect transmission through contact can also occur. In health care settings, patients can be cohorted or should stay in individual rooms. Droplet precautions and hand hygiene should be performed by attending health care workers and attendants. Gloves and gowns are required for personal protection if there is potential exposure to infected body fluids. Aerosol producing procedures should be minimized, ideally conducted in negative pressure rooms and protection with N95 mask is needed by the health care personnel conducting such procedures.",
