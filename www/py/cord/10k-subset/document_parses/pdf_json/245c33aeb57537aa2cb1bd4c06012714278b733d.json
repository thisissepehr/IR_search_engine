All known immune systems, however primitive or advanced, show these three basic characteristics. 1 However, the ability ofthe immune system to recognize and respond to foreign materials or tolerate self components is not absolute; these functions operate robustly within a given range, as normal physiology, beyond which dysfunction leads to immune pathology. Susceptibility to infection, immunopathology and autoimmunity are probably extreme examples in a spectrum of immune failure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 463, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The molecular basis for immune recognition, response and tolerance is relatively well-studied in adaptive immunity of vertebrates, but such research was neglected in innate immunity until recently, despite the fact that most species rely solely on innate immunity to achieve these core immune functions. Innate immunity lacks most of the basic molecular machinery employed by the adaptive system such as somatically rearranged high affinity antigen receptors used by lymphocytes and thymic education ofT cells for central tolerance, indicating the presence of a fundamenrally different mechanism in innate immunity. The first major conceptual breakthrough came when Janeway proposed that cells of the innate immune system express a large repertoire of germ-line encoded receptors which recognize invariant molecular structures on pathogens, which are essential and unique to pathogens and not present in the host. He coined the term pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for such molecular structures, recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRR). PRRs are further subdivided into intracellular or cell surface molecules. Humoral PRRs generally recognise pathogens from various body fluids and form aggregates which are subsequently cleared by phagocytes. Apart from this opsonising ability they also have many immunomodulatory properties. Cell surface PRRs are either phagocytidendocytic or sensor in nature. Phagocytic receptors bind and internalise ligands directly and display temperature dependent, saturable and inhibitable ligand binding kinetics of classical receptors. On the other hand sensors do not bind or internalise ligand directly, but recognise PAMPs and induce a proinflammatory signalling cascade which leads to many antimicrobial effector responses. It is important to note that many intracellular PRRs are also sensing molecules. 4 A schematic diagram of different classes ofPRRs and selected examples are presented in Figure  1 . There is recent evidence that components of the cellular and humoral arms of the innate immune system collaborate to induce and maintain host defence. 5 . 6 Although amendments have been recently proposed to the original concept of pattern recognition, this remains fundamental to our present understanding ofinnate immunity. \"Molecular patterns\" are not restricted to pathogens, but are also expressed by commensals; it has been argued that microbial ligands should be characterised molecularly, in preference to introducing the term PAMp' 7 Although not clearly stated, it could be extrapolated from Janeway's proposal that self tolerance is achieved in innate immunity through \"ignorance\" as PRRs only recognize microbial molecules. This is in contrast to adaptive immunity where tolerance is achieved by \"education\". This theory of ignorance is challenged by recent observations that many PRRs recognize modified host molecules (generated during normal or aberrant metabolism) as well as naturally occurring host molecules, other than microbial structures. 8 It is conceivable that during evolution multipurpose PRRs were selected to recognize microbial molecules to counter infectious challenges, modified host molecules for clearing, homeostasis and natural host molecules for immunomodulation, thus minimizing the genetic resources invested in immunity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1865, "end": 1866, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2117, "end": 2122, "text": "5 . 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3027, "end": 3028, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1954, "end": 1963, "text": "Figure  1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this chapter we will discuss how PRRs differentially recognize microbial, modified host molecules as well as natural host molecules using examples from two major classes of PRRs, class A scavenger receptors and C type lectin families.

On the other hand, if MHC-I expression is absent or reduced, as in the case of viral infection or tumour cells, NK cells recognise them as foreign. However, \"missing self' alone does not determine the target cell killing and virus-infected or tumour cells also express ligands for many activatory receptors present on NK cells, which initiate the killing machinery. Therefore absence of MHC-I as a self marker and presence of ligands for activatory NK cell receptors together act as a switch for cytotoxic activity ofNK cells. 88 Inhibitory receptor-mediated self tolerance is also observed in the Mep system. SIRP-a (CDIna) is a predominantly myeloid restricted molecule ofthe immunoglobulin superfamily (IGSF), whereas its ligand CD47 is more broadly expressed, including on myeloid cells. CD Ina contains three extracellular Ig-like domains; its intracellular domain contains several tyrosines and has been shown to interact with the tyrosine phosphatases SHPI and SHP2.

Recent advances in molecular and cellular biology make it possible to study new aspects of innate immunity and to understand the causes of many infectious and immune pathologies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Innate immunity: An overview", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Beutler", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Mol Immunol", "volume": "40", "issn": "12", "pages": "845--859", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The immune system evolved to discriminate infectious nonself from noninfectious self", "authors": [{"first": "Janeway", "middle": [], "last": "Jr", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["A"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1992, "venue": "Immunol Today", "volume": "13", "issn": "1", "pages": "11--16", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Innate immune recognition", "authors": [{"first": "Janeway", "middle": [], "last": "Jr", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Medzhitov", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Annu Rev Immunol", "volume": "20", "issn": "", "pages": "197--216", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Macrophage receptors and immune recognition", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Taylor", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Martinez-Pomares", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Stacey", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Annu Rev Immunol", "volume": "23", "issn": "", "pages": "901--944", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "The potential for Toll-like receptors to collaborate with other innate immune receptors", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Mukhopadhyay", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Herre", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Immunology", "volume": "112", "issn": "4", "pages": "521--530", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Complexity and complementarity of outer membrane protein A recognition by cellular and humoral innate immunity receptors", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Jeannin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Bottazzi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Sironi", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Immunity", "volume": "22", "issn": "5", "pages": "551--560", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Not \"molecular patterns' but molecules", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Beutler", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Immunity", "volume": "19", "issn": "2", "pages": "155--156", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Pattern recognition receptors: Doubling up for the innate immune response", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Gordon", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Cell", "volume": "111", "issn": "7", "pages": "927--930", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Binding site on macrophages that mediates uptake and degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein, producing massive cholesterol deposition", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Goldstein", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Ho", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Basu", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1979, "venue": "Proc Nat!

Endo180 is predominantly expressed by fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages. DC-SIGN is highly expressed by mature and immature DCs and by subpopulations of macrophages in the lung and placenta.

The binding of mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan to DC-SIGN blocks DC maturation and triggers inhibitory signals that allow this bacterium to evade the immune response.51 Dendritic cells playa pivotal role in antitumor responses where DC-SIGN interacts with colorectal cancer cells via Lewis' carbohydrate moieties on carcinoembryonic antigen produced by the cancer cells during malignant transformation.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Class A scavenger receptor recognition ofendogenous and exogenous ligands", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Receptor </td><td>Microbial Ligand </td><td>Refs </td><td>Endogenous Ligand </td><td>Refs </td><td>Modified Self Ligand </td><td>Refs\n</td></tr><tr><td>SR-A </td><td>LPS and LTA </td><td>15 </td><td>Unidentified protein </td><td>25 </td><td>~ amyloid protein </td><td>23\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>ligand in serum\nActivated B cells </td><td>26 </td><td>Apoptotic cells </td><td>38\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Ox-LDL and Ac-LDL </td><td>9\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>AGE modified protein </td><td>24\n</td></tr><tr><td>MARCO </td><td>LPS </td><td>39 </td><td>UGRP-1 </td><td>34 </td><td>Ac-LDL </td><td>40\n</td></tr><tr><td>SRCL-I </td><td>G+, G bacteria, Yeast\n</td><td>35,36 </td><td>T and Tn antigen </td><td>37 </td><td>Ox-LDL </td><td>35,36\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
