The Met11Thr polymorphism is located in codon 11 in the SP-D N-terminal region and it has been reported previously that this amino acid change influences the oligomerization of the human SP-D protein thereby impacting on its function [10] . Furthermore, SP-D protein posttranslational modifications such as nitrosylation of multimeric SP-D could cause collagen tail wrapping and affect SP-D binding ability to the calreticulin/CD91 receptor on macrophages. This, in turn, might lead to higher anti-inflammatory activity as compared with normal trimeric SP-D protein [21] . Moreover, a previous study demonstrated that multimeric SP-D protein was a better inhibitor of Gram-positive and negative bacteria as well as influenza virus A compared to SP-D, with a lower degree oligomerization [22] . In our study, we found that AKI subjects with 11Thr/Thr genotype had higher serum SP-D levels than those with 11Met/Met and 11Thr/Met genotypes, which may also contribute to individual susceptibility to AKI. These [23] demonstrated that higher baseline plasma SP-D levels were associated with a greater risk of mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Indeed, higher baseline serum SP-D levels were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including a higher degree of kidney injury, longer RRT duration and increased risk of death in our study. It has been shown previously that alveolar type II epithelial cell hyperplasia can be stimulated by intra-tracheal administration of KGF-2 to increase SP-D secretion. SP-D easily disseminates into blood vessels due to its hydrophilic nature, therefore, serum SP-D level may be used as a sensitive marker of the permeability of alveolar epithelial cells [24] . In the present study, serum SP-D levels in AKI patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls, and reached a peak at day three. We speculate that increased serum SP-D levels in AKI patients may be attributed to large amounts of SP-D protein secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells which may accumulate in renal tubular lumen. In addition, SP-D protein from the tubular lumen may leak into the lumen of blood vessels when the barrier function of tubular epithelial cells is damaged. The permeability of tubular epithelial cells is related with the severity of renal injury, When the kidney suffers injury, and the more severely the renal epithelial cell barrier is damaged, the more SP-D protein would leak into blood from tubular lumen,which may explain the significant correlation between higher serum SP-D levels and higher stage of renal injury in AKI patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 401, "end": 405, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 954, "end": 958, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1882, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "KIM-1 is a reliable and early predictor for AKI, as demonstrated by preclinical and clinical trials [25] .

The average APACHE II score of the AKI patients was 20.3 \u00b1 4.58. Out of 159 AKI patients, 60 (37.7%) AKI patients were treated with RRT, and the average RRT duration was 10.6 \u00b1 3.38 days.
