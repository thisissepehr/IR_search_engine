Vaccination is an effective disease prevention and control method, but limitations remain for protecting against catastrophic mortality of fish infected with different strains of streptococci. Immunoproteomics analysis of S. agalactiae was used to identify antigenic proteins and construct a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Epitopes from five antigenic proteins were shuffled in five helices of a flavodoxin backbone, and in silico analysis predicted a suitable RnA and protein structure for protein expression. 45F2 and 42E2 were identified as the best candidates for a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to produce a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine system. Overexpressed proteins were determined to be 30 kDa and 25 kDa in the E. coli and TK1 systems, respectively. The efficacy of the chimeric multiepitope construct as a recombinant protein vaccine and DnA vaccine was evaluated in nile tilapia, followed by S. agalactiae challenge at 1 \u00d7 10 7 cfU/mL. Relative percentage survival (RpS) and cumulative mortality were recorded at approximately 57-76% and 17-30%, respectively. These chimeric multiepitope vaccines should be applied in streptococcosis disease control and developed into a multivalent vaccine to control multiple diseases.",

The second fraction was subjected to LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry to identify the immunogenic proteins. The protein profile from the immunoprecipitation on 1D-SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the major protein (approximately 55 kDa) corresponded to rabbit immunoglobulin. However, several bacterial proteins could not be bound to rabbit immunoglobulin and were removed through the flow-through fraction (FT), whereas the protein that specifically bound to the anti-S. agalactiae antibody could be detected in the eluted fraction (Fig. 1) .",

Moreover, this vaccine type is more efficient than whole antigens for controlling Staphylococcus spp. infections 20, 30 . From the present study, Table 2 . Predicted conformational B-cell epitopes from 3D structure of designed chimeric multiepitope vaccines using DiscoTope 2.0 server. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ linear B cell epitope prediction was assessed and identified 11 potent epitopes from 5 common immunogenic and virulence proteins that were present in serotypes Ia and III.

Prediction of candidate antigenic proteins can be used to select the bacterial strains that carry antigenic genes, as well as to determine high expression levels in the target host and the accessibility of particular antigens in host organisms 16 .

In addition to the \u03b1/\u03b2-type folding of flavodoxin, it was also useful to construct our chimeric multiepitope vaccine by forcing the 5 chosen epitope segments to fit within 5 \u03b1-helix loops and protrude out of the 3D-folded structure since that configuration benefits protein solubility by exposure to water molecules 23 . Additionally, this linker may promote the solubility of the constructed vaccine and help enhance the recognition of the vaccine by the host's immune system, which contributes to vaccine efficacy. 45F2 and 42E2 presented the most favored region of protein folding, with the stereochemical quality representing the disallowed region at only 0.7%, which is acceptable since the minimum quality should be less than 2% 32 . It is suggested that in silico analysis could design a chimeric multiepitope vaccine that could probably manifest effective properties 33,34 . To achieve a high level of protein expression in Nile tilapia, codon optimization was conducted to improve the transcription and translation capability by removing all possible cis-acting sequence motifs, which may have a negative impact on protein expression. Both proteins had a CAI > 0.8 and a codon with frequent distribution (CFD) > 30%, which are acceptable for high expression in the target organism 18, 21 . The GC content of 45F2 and 42E2 was optimized between 30-70% and had a suitable thermodynamic ensemble free energy, which allowed RNA folding and thermodynamic stability 35, 36 . The overall points suggested that the modeled 45F2 chimeric multiepitope vaccine was clearly the best candidate vaccine.",

However, it is known that single-serotype whole-cell inactivated vaccines have limitations during cross-prevention against different serotypes. For instance, a S. iniae vaccine (serotype I) could not protect Atlantic salmon from infection by S. iniae (serotype II) 39 . Meanwhile, mixed-serotype vaccines (serotypes IV and VII) could promote antiserum levels and enhance the survival rate of newborn pups against streptococcal infection 40 . Although formalin-killed vaccines generally provide highly protective effects compared with those of subunit vaccines and DNA vaccines, the subunit and DNA vaccines may replace the original formalin-killed vaccines or inactivated vaccines due to their promising efficacy, which are similar to those of inactivated vaccines, and longer shelf life 18, 33 . Evidence suggests that DNA and subunit vaccines can efficiently trigger the immune system and promote protective efficacy, with an RPS value greater than 50% 11, 13, 14, 17 . Nevertheless, these vaccines have limitations, such as their mass production costs, and they may require various optimizations to obtain the highest stable storage conditions 18, 41 .",

            "text": "Regarding this idea, a chimeric multiepitope vaccine composed of different epitopes from different proteins common in both serotypes Ia and III was generated to achieve broad protection against different serotypes and increase their stability. Interestingly, the designed chimeric multiepitope DNA vaccine and protein vaccine exhibited effective prevention in Nile tilapia against S. agalactiae, with efficacy similar to that of the whole-cell inactivated vaccine. This evidence supports the strategy of rational vaccine design through B cell recognition using in silico analysis. Importantly, immunoproteomics analysis could assist the preliminary determination of suitable immunogenic proteins for vaccine development due to the distinct antigenic determinants that can mediate dissimilar immune responses. The criterion in immunogenic protein selection for vaccine development has focused on the ability of a particular protein to induce an immune response. Among 79 identified proteins shared in both serotypes, in addition to providing the highest BCPRED scores (Table 1) , the 5 proteins chosen were also reported as virulence proteins and used as vaccine candidates for streptococcosis disease prevention 13 . For example, C-\u03b2 protein (BAC) can lead to antibody production through Fc region binding of human IgA 42 . Sip protein has been shown to mediate protection against streptococcal infection 11, 13, 14 . Additionally, the chosen immunogenic protein should be conserved among Streptococcus spp., so it would be suitable for application in cross-reactive prevention among S. agalactiae serotypes 11, 43 . Moreover, it should be mentioned that peptide vaccines or epitopes with only 30 amino acid residues may trigger immune responses through binding directly to MHC-I or MHC-II molecules. These molecules localize to nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells. Vaccines containing proteins with longer amino acid sequences can enhance the presentation of epitopes to dendritic cells due to T cell induction 25, 44, 45 . Herein, the comparative efficacy of both the 45F2 and 42E2 DNA and recombinant protein vaccines indicated that the DNA vaccine provided a higher efficacy than the recombinant protein vaccine. This result suggests that the DNA vaccine can prolong the activation of the immune response by triggering both humoral and cellular immune responses 46, 47 . Moreover, the clearance rate of the recombinant protein vaccine in the host system may be faster than that of the DNA vaccine. This difference implies that the DNA vaccine can enter the host cell to produce chimeric multiepitope protein, with that protein existing in the host system for longer than the recombinant protein vaccine, thus enhancing its bioavailability.",
