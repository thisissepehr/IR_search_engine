Moreover, we have previously described and reported this microbial association. 6 In the present study, P. jirovecii was detected in the apparent absence of other pathogens in 11 infants, suggesting that the fungus may play a role in pulmonary syndrome pathogenesis. Nonetheless, all positive infants recovered, despite the absence of specific treatment for the fungus. We can hypothesize that the presence of P. jirovecii followed by clinical improvement could be explained by the \"immune-naive\" status of infants on the one hand, and the role of symptomatic treatment and physiotherapy in the absence of overt immunosuppression on the other hand. Contrary to Larsen and colleagues' study in which P. jirovecii detection was specifically associated with URTI, in our study lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) appear as an associated factor. 8 This result is consistent with the fact that P. jirovecii infection effectively takes place deep within the lungs and specifically in alveoli in close contact with type I pneumocytes. 2 Pneumocystis primary infection contemporary to first contacts with the fungus may present as a mild LRTI.

To the best of our knowledge none of them are associated with overt immunosuppression. Nonetheless, this association pro-vides additional arguments to the well-recognized links between P. jirovecii and infant frailty. 1 Hyaline membrane disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a factor negatively associated with P. jirovecii detection. This negative association remains unclear, but it may be explained by the fact that we did not identify prematurity as an associated factor, whereas it is assumed that there is a relationship between prematurity and hyaline membrane disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 27 The univariate analysis pointed out the absence of hospital discharge after birth as a factor negatively associated with P. jirovecii detection. This result was confirmed by multivariate analysis. Thus, P. jirovecii is mostly acquired in the community by infants who have left the hospital after birth. In contrast, P. jirovecii was only found in two out of the 57 infants who had not left the hospital after birth. These results were expected since the infants who stayed at the hospital after birth were younger than those who were discharged (median age, 22 days; interquartile range [IQR], 14.5-36 vs. median age, 118 days; IQR, 43-283). Nonetheless, P. jirovecii acquisition can happen within the hospital premises, the potential human sources such as health care workers, patients or mothers remaining undetermined in this case. To sum up, our results support the possibility of both community and nosocomial acquisitions of the fungus also in the context of primary infection in infants as previously shown for PCP in immunosuppressed adults. 28, 29 The multivariate analysis also identified the 63-189-day group as a factor associated with P. jirovecii detection. The median age of positive infants was 3 months and 24 days (IQR, 75-173 days), whereas it was 5 months (IQR, 3.7-9.3 months), 3 months (IQR, 73-112 days), 3 months (2-4 months) in Chile, Denmark, and Peru, respectively (Ochoa TJ, Bustamante B, Garcia C al., manuscript in preparation). 7, 8 In our study reported 17 years ago, the median age of positive infants was 5 months (IQR, 4-6 months) ( Figure 1 ). 6, 30 Comparing the results of the aforementioned studies must be done cautiously, nonetheless the values of median and IQR ages of positive infants are close. These common characteristics suggest that first contacts with P. jirovecii, and consequently primary infection in infants, is a common process occurring at the same time in life, regardless the geographical location, rather than an incidental event.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 268, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 621, "end": 623, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 885, "end": 887, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 888, "end": 890, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1026, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1309, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1702, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2753, "end": 2756, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2757, "end": 2759, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3162, "end": 3164, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3165, "end": 3166, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3283, "end": 3285, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3286, "end": 3288, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1078, "end": 1087, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3279, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The analysis of P. jirovecii detection results in infants in Chile, Denmark, Peru, and France, pointed out significant differences of prevalence (P < .001) with a higher prevalence in South America than in Europe (Figure 2 ) (Ochoa TJ, Bustamante B, Garcia C al., manuscript in preparation). 7, 8 Beyond differences in methods, these results may be related to the genuine geographical specificity of Pneumocystis epidemiology. This hypothesis was previously assumed to explain the difference of Pneumocystis colonization prevalence in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. 24, 25 Considering Maitte and colleagues' proposal for P. jirovecii genotyping and our skill in this area, we chose to analyze the mtLSU, CYB and SOD loci. 15, 17 The discriminatory power of the typing system increased from the unilocus approach through the bilocus approach to the MLST method. These results were expected, considering recommendations of MLST for microorganism typing methods published elsewhere. 21 The apparent diversity of P. jirovecii grew according to the increase in discriminatory power of the typing method used. Consequently, the unilocus and bilocus approaches showed that genotypes were common in infants and adults, whereas no MLST genotype was shared.
