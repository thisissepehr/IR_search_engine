Systemic administration of Ad vectors leads to gene expression mainly in the liver. 2 Pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors via the vascular route has proven to be limited with respect to efficiency in part because of difficulty in assuring significant residence time in the lung and/or paucity of receptors for adenovirus on the endothelium. Two approaches have been proposed to overcome the problem of restricted tropism: one is to genetically modify Ad vectors to render them target cell-specific [3] [4] [5] and the other one is to use bispecific conjugates to redirect Ad vectors to target cells. [6] [7] [8] [9] Several groups have reported selective delivery of Ad vectors to various types of cells via genetic modifications of Ad vectors. [3] [4] [5] Thus far, there is no successful report of targeted delivery of Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium using this approach. The concept of targeted delivery of Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium has been nicely demonstrated in a study by report that pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors can also be improved significantly via the use of cationic liposomes. Preinjection of cationic liposomes followed by adenovirus led to a significant increase in the level of gene expression in the lung. The improvement in pulmonary gene transfer was associated with a decrease in the level of gene expression in the liver. Gene expression in the lung lasted for up to 2 weeks. This protocol, together with genetic modification of adenovirus, may prove to be useful for pulmonary gene transfer for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This method may also be extended to pulmonary gene transfer using other types of viral vectors via vascular route. Gene Therapy (2002) 9, 176-182. DOI: 10.1038/sj/gt/3301636",

Gene expression was assayed 3 days following the injection. When AdCMVLuc alone was used, the liver had the highest level of gene expression (Figure 1b) . A low level of gene expression was found in the lung and other organs. There was about a 100 to 1000-fold difference in the level of gene expression between the liver and lung (Figure 1b) . Preinjection of cationic liposomes significantly improved gene expression in the lung. As shown in Figure 1a , increasing the amount of cationic liposomes from 0.3 to 0.9 mol/mouse led to a steady increase in the level of gene expression in the lung. At the dose of 0.9 mol DOTAP per mouse, a range of eight-to 40-fold increase in gene expression was observed in seven different experiments. Continuous increase in DOTAP dose was not associated with a further increase in gene expression in the lung. Interestingly, the improvement in gene expression in the lung was associated with a dramatic decrease in gene expression in the liver (Figure 1b) .",

In contrast to sequential injection, premixing of cationic liposomes with AdCM-VLuc resulted in a decreased gene expression in all major organs examined ( Figure 2 ). Complexation of cationic lipids with AdCMVLuc had minimal effects on infection of cultured mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) at low doses and inhibited gene expression at relatively high doses (data not shown). Figure 3 shows gene expression in liver and lung 3 days following injection of various amounts of AdCMVLuc, alone or following preinjection of DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes (0.9 mol/mouse). Increasing the amount of AdCMVLuc from 1 to 4 \u00d7 10 10 particles/mouse led to a significant increase in gene expression in the lung.

The improvement in pulmonary gene transfer is associated with a decrease in the level of gene expression in the liver (Figure 1b) . Based on cytokine response, this protocol is safe and the liposomes used do not add to the Ad vector-related toxicities ( Figure 8 ). The sequential injection protocol was initially described by Song and colleagues 21 to address the roles of cationic liposomes in cationic lipid-mediated pulmonary gene transfer via the vascular route. Recently Tan et al 10 have extended these studies by showing that pulmonary gene transfer via sequential injection protocol is even more efficient than that via cationic liposome/DNA complexes. Moreover, the sequential injection protocol overcomes, at least partially, the CpG-related proinflammatory cytokine response that is associated with systemic administration of cationic liposome/DNA complexes. The mechanism of pulmonary gene transfer via sequential protocol is not clearly understood at present. It might be due to a transient slow-down of pulmonary microcirculation by preinjected liposomes, which allows for efficient interaction of subsequently injected DNA with the target cells (endothelial cells). The improved lung gene transfer by Ad vectors via the sequential protocol might be due to a similar mechanism. This was supported by the observation that more viral DNA was detected in lungs of mice that received sequential injection of cationic liposomes and Ad vectors than in lungs of mice that received Ad vectors alone (Figure 7) . The increased pulmonary uptake of Ad vectors may play an important role in improving the efficiency of gene expression in the lung. Ad vectors are likely to be taken up by endothelial cells in free form.",

However, mixing of AdCMVLuc with DOTAP: cholesterol liposomes had minimal effect on infection of cultured mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) despite an increased cellular uptake of Ad vectors (data not shown). At high doses, DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes inhibited infection of MLEC in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Similarly, mixing of DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes with AdCMVLuc led to a decreased level of gene expression in the lung (Figure 2 ). These differences might reflect the different cellular barriers in Ad-mediated infection in different cell types. MLEC might lack an efficient mechanism in mediating the release of Ad vectors into cytosol following cellular uptake of cationic lipid-complexed Ad vectors. Despite an improved cellular uptake, cationic lipids may inhibit the subsequent release of Ad vectors into cytosol, thus resulting in an overall decreased level of gene expression.

The advantages of our method lie in its simplicity. Cationic liposomes can be prepared in large quantities in a cost-effective manner. This protocol requires no modification of Ad vectors, therefore it can be used for different Ad vectors containing different therapeutic genes. This protocol might be combined with other approaches to achieve a synergistic effect in lung targeting.
