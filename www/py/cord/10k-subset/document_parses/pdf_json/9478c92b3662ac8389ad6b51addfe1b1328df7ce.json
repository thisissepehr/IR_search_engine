We describe a patient with rapidly progressing ARDS and myocarditis secondary to spotted fever caused by Rickettsia conorii.

Case presentation: A 53 years old manual worker presented with fever for 5 days and a skin rash. He was in circulatory failure on admission and developed severe hypoxaemia with gross changes in chest radiograph by next day requiring assisted ventilation. He had myocarditis causing left ventricular failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was confirmed to have spotted fever rickettsial infection with rising titre of indirect immunofluorescence antibodies to Ricketssia conorii and made a complete recovery with appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care.

In myocarditis, patients usually develop undue tiredness, chest discomfort and dyspnoea which may progress to cardiogenic shock or development of arrhythmias. Most often it is diagnosed clinically with ECG abnormalities such as T wave inversions, bundle branch blocks and presence or rhythm abnormalities. Echocardiography and elevation of cardiac biomarkers can be used to diagnose myocarditis but these become evident mostly in severe cases. In the background of sepsis, transient cardiac dysfunction can occur due to sepsis induced cardiomyopathy. Differentiation between the two diagnoses can only be achieved by endomyocardial biopsy. However, in acutely ill patients it is not justifiable do biopsy as it does not alter the management. Further, in the available literature suggests that rickettsial infections related cardiac dysfunction is more likely to be due to myocarditis [8, 9, 12] . Newer methods including cardiac MRI and segmented inversion recovery gradient-echocardiography pulse sequences have a better sensitivity in diagnosing acute myocarditis [13, 14] .
