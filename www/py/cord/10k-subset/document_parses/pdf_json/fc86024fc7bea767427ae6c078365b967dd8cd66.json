Spiny crayfish are slow growing, have very large claws and usually prefer clear, cool water. Because of their low meat yield and slow growth, they are not farmed. They are important fauna of streams where habitat is suitable, and many have highly restricted distributions, low fecundity and are listed as endangered. The best known of the spiny crayfish is the Murray River cray (Euastacus armatus). Smooth-shelled crayfish include commercially and recreationally important species such as marron (Cherax cainii), redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus), and the ubiquitous 'yabby' (Cherax spp.).",

The zoospores are attracted to crayfish cuticle, and the filaments penetrate immediately. Zoospores can remain motile for up to 3 days and cysts can survive for 2 weeks (in distilled water). 4 Zoospores can re-encyst three times if they do not encounter a host. It is recommended to wait 3 months before attempting to re-stock waters in which crayfish have been killed by crayfish plague, to allow all zoospores to die out. Crayfish plague is also spread via contaminated fishing equipment or zoospores in water. 5 American crayfish, including red swamp crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) are tolerant of infection. They can remain carriers for life, and may exhibit little or no sign of infection. Until recently, crayfish plague was only known in temperate to cool climates, but a Spanish strain is active at temperatures of 18-25\u00b0C. The strain that affects the invasive red swamp crawfish can sporulate at temperatures up to 29.5\u00b0C. 4 Red swamp crawfish have established in Japan, China and Taiwan, and populations are sometimes maintained in ornamental fish outlets in the region. 1 Thus there is potential for spread of the pathogen throughout the region, either in contaminated water or with live or dead crayfish.",

Different surgical and non-surgical options for canine population control were discussed by Dr Cyril Perumamthadathil (Charles Sturt University) and Laurencie Brunel (University of Sydney). Emeritus Professor Rick Speare raised some questions about One Health, a concept that is accepted at the highest levels of government and written into policies and vision statements, but remains hard to define. On the final day of the conference, the Honourable Peter Chandler, Deputy Chief Minister and NT Minister for Education, launched AMRRIC's latest educational resource: 'Staying safe around dogs' . Dog bites and attacks in remote Indigenous communities are heavily under-reported, said AMRRIC CEO Julia Hardaker. \"Dangerous human-dog interaction has become an accepted part of life in some communities, but it's one that has a huge impact on the people living and working in those communities. \" Funding from the NT Department of Local Government (Animal Welfare Branch) allowed AMRRIC to collaborate with the late animal behaviourist Dr Sophia Yin and well-known Australian photographer David Darcy. Other conference highlights were performances by the One Mob dancers, Indigenous musician and NT Australian of the Year 2014, Shellie Morris, and MC -and former White Ribbon Ambassador of the Year -Charlie King.",
