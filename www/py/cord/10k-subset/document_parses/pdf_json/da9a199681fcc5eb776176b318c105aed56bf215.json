Confidence intervals around these negative point estimates are wide and cross the null, but broach statistical significance in some analyses. Chance statistical variation, methodological bias, or a true biological phenomenon are among possible explanations. With vaccine coverage of 60%, our sample of just over 300 participants, approximately equally cases and controls, would have been sufficient to detect a statistically-significant VE of at least 50% (in either direction of the null), with 80% power. Sample size requirements increase dramatically as VE more closely approaches zero, as illustrated also by CIRN's failure to achieve significance despite more than triple the sample size [7] . In that regard negative VE estimates may reflect statistical variation around a true null effect although we cannot rule out that with additional sample size, VE estimates may have crossed toward statistically-significant negative VE. Our study was predicated on the test-negative design, and, as for all observational studies, residual bias and confounding cannot be ruled out. With adjustment for recognized confounders VE estimates were generally reduced but showed greater variability, likely owing to greater sample size requirements to support multiple covariates. It is reassuring, however, that VE estimates were improved toward the null with restriction to more uniform and majority subgroups of participants including those with primary residence in the community, comprising two-thirds of our data set, or among participants with specimen collection 4 days since illness onset, comprising three-quarters of participants. VE was reduced among patients with comorbidity, comprising >90% of participants but including a wide variety of conditions, in whom bias related to propensity to vaccinate or to hospitalize likely varies a lot. Factors confounding the association between vaccination and hospitalization risk are more complex than for outpatient medical visits, and this requires more in-depth evaluation generally in the interpretation of VE estimates for hospitalization outcomes, especially for seniors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 851, "end": 854, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although statistically most consistent with a null vaccine effect overall, it is also prudent to consider whether negative point estimates of VE in the elderly may reflect a true epidemiological finding.

SPSN findings in repeat vaccine recipients for the 2014/15 season were also associated with wide and overlapping confidence intervals, consistent also with null vaccine effects in both subgroups. A number of other recent studies in Canada, the United States, and Europe have also reported interference from prior receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . While these other studies showed negative interference that sometimes reduces protection (i.e. a lower but still positive VE point estimate), a negative VE estimate would suggest that vaccine interference may sometimes also be associated with increased disease risk. For several decades, the elderly have been a highly and recurrently immunized group, and virtually all of the vaccinated elderly in our study had received TIV in the past.

Prior receipt of 2008/09 seasonal vaccine was associated with negative VE against the markedly mismatched 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) virus, observed predominantly in non-elderly individuals. This observation was reported by Canada's SPSN and at least four other studies in Canada [27] , subsequently also from Hong Kong [28] , the US [29] and Japan [30] and thereafter also in a randomized ferret trial [31] . The Canadian studies showed statistically significant two-fold increased risk (VE of -100%) for medically-attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness but risk was not increased for hospitalization outcomes. This is different from the current season's finding of lesser magnitude, statistically non-significant and more variable vaccine effects (VE of -39%) against A(H3N2) hospitalization in the elderly, for which chance variation around the null and/or methodological considerations may be more likely explanations. Additional studies are needed to definitively resolve the potential concern of vaccine-associated increased risk and/or to clarify the conditions of vaccine mismatch under which it may recur (e.g. antigenic distances [32] , immunological cohort effects based on original antigenic prime vs. boost exposures). In fact, the underlying mechanisms and virus-host immunological interactions to explain variability in disease burden and VE by age and influenza subtype require better understanding generally. The reason why elderly people suffer disproportionately from A(H3N2) subtype infections, as per the current season [3, 4] remains a longstanding but unanswered question.

A substantial proportion of elderly patients were excluded because they were unable to recall or report important information, such as vaccination status and date of symptom onset. However, their inclusion in indicator sensitivity analyses did not meaningfully alter VE estimates. Vaccine status was self-reported and this may have resulted in exposure misclassification; however, this information was collected prior to influenza diagnosis, minimizing differential misclassification. Studies in other settings, including hospitalized elderly, have reported consistency between self-reported and registry-based influenza vaccine status although that may not directly apply here [33, 34] . We think accuracy of self-reported vaccine status in our study may even be better because information was collected from patients within a shorter period of time since vaccination campaign as compared to the studies cited above. In addition, vaccination coverage in influenza-negative patients enrolled in our study was consistent with that reported from other sources during previous years of the study [8, 14] . Our study was conducted during peak weeks of the influenza season; this may raise concerns about the particular impact of outcome misclassification (i.e. false negative cases) on our VE estimates. We have previously shown that other respiratory viruses remain an important cause of respiratory hospitalization even during peak weeks of the influenza epidemic [8] . The assay we used for influenza diagnosis has been reported elsewhere to have sensitivity >95% (98% for influenza A virus), with comparable proportions testing respiratory virus positive as per individual nucleic acid amplification testing across age groups [35] . Even with sensitivity for influenza detection as low as 70%, in the context of near-perfect specificity, outcome misclassification has been shown to have negligible impact on VE estimates [36] . Although test sensitivity may be lower in elderly adults, it is unlikely to drop below 70%. Finally, in the test-negative study design, when patients with influenza are not censored and can also contribute as controls during another respiratory illness episode, the odds ratio directly estimates the relative risk and is not affected by the rare disease assumption [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 716, "end": 719, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1129, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1130, "end": 1133, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1498, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1763, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1958, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2330, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we report negative point estimates that are statistically non-significant for VE against A(H3N2) hospitalization in the elderly for the 2014/15 season.
