Mucosal HPVs have evolved mechanisms that impede IFN-b synthesis and downregulate genes induced by IFN. Here we show that these HPV types directly subvert a cellular transcriptional response to IFN-b as a potential boost in infection. Treatment with low levels of human IFN-b induced initial amplification of HPV-16 and HPV-11 plasmid genomes and increased HPV-16 or HPV-31 DNA copy numbers up to 6-fold in HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. IFN treatment also increased early gene transcription from the major early gene promoters in HPV-16, HPV-31 and HPV-11. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the viral genomes and ectopic interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression in transfection experiments using IRF-1 2/2 , IRF-2 2/2 and dual knockout cell lines determined that these responses are due to the activation of IRF-1 interaction with a conserved interferon response element demonstrated in several mucosal HPV early gene promoters. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the varying clinical outcomes of IFN therapy of papillomatoses and define an assay for the modulation of the HPV gene program by IFNs as well as other cytokines and signaling molecules in infection and therapy.",

Interferons (IFNs) are potent modulators of cell growth and differentiation as well as host immune responses to viral infections (2, 3) . IFNs have historically been used in the treatment of laryngeal papillomas as well as other HPVassociated lesions, often with inconsistent clinical outcomes (4) (5) (6) . Many viruses have evolved complex immunoevasive strategies and HPVs are no exception (7) (8) (9) (10) . HPV infection is associated with an altered immunogenic profile of keratinocytes in vivo (11, 12) including altered cytokine expression (13, 14) . Cervical lesions undergoing malignant progression in vivo, as well as human keratinocytes harboring persistently replicating HPV plasmid genomes, exhibit compromised immunoreactive cellular pathways such as decreased expression of IFNs and IFN-dependent pathways (15, 16) . Decreases in IFNinducible factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-1 (17) (18) (19) and viral infection-induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 (20) have also been documented. A previous study described IRF-1 binding to the HPV-16 major early promoter (21) and E7 proteins from mucosal or cutaneous HPVs were shown to directly inhibit the function of IRF-9 (p48) (22) and IRF-1 (23) (24) (25) .",

Members of the IRF family of factors have been shown to be essential for cellular differentiation and proliferation as well as host response to viral infection (reviewed in ref. 27 ). Loss of IRF-1 (a putative tumor suppressor protein), for example, has been shown to be an important step for oncogene-induced transformation and apoptosis (28, 29) and has also been detected in a variety of human leukemias and preleukemic myelodysplasias (30) . IFNs have also been shown to modulate viral replication in non-HPV viruses (31, 32) . In HPV, recent studies have shown that high doses of IFN reduce viral plasmid load while selecting for latent integrated HPV genomes in explant-derived HPV-16-positive cervical keratinocytes (33, 34) .",

Oligonucleotides spanning this putative IRE in the HPV-16 P97 promoter were constructed to detect the binding of IRFs in mobility shift assays ( Figure 1B) . Nucleotide substitutions designed to disrupt the binding of these factors were introduced into the homology shared by several mucosal HPV E6-E7 promoters, including HPV-31 (another high-risk HPV type) and HPV-11 (a 'low risk' type). A complex specifically formed between keratinocyte extracts or purified recombinant proteins and the putative HPV-16 IRE. The composite keratinocyte complex was identified as IRF-1 and IRF-2 by binding specificity, complex mobility and antigenicity ( Figure 1B, lanes 5-8) . In contrast to most other cell lineages, the ratio of constitutive binding of endogenous IRF-1 and IRF-2 to the P97 promoter of HPV-16 genomes was distinct in keratinocytes as demonstrated in transfected SCC13 cells using chromatin immuno-precipitations quantified by competitive PCR (Figure 1C , lanes 5 and 6). These results were consistent with in vitro mobility shift assays with keratinocyte extracts which also demonstrated a higher ratio of IRF-1 to IRF-2 binding ( Figure 1B ) in these cells even though rIRF-1 and rIRF-2 exhibited identical dissociation constants (K d ), ranging from 0.3 to 20 nM in parallel (Table I) . We expanded this analysis to include multiple additional mucosal HPV types, demonstrating for the first time that IRF-1 and IRF-2 binding is a conserved feature among eight additional major early promoters in HPV types 6, 13, 31, 33, 35, 52, 56 and 72 (Table I) .",

We first monitored the formation of IFN-inducible complexes: Stat-1, IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 and IRF-1, using their cognate binding sequences ( Figure 1A ) and IFN-treated keratinocyte extracts in mobility shift assays (Figure 2A ). All three complexes formed with control sequences immediately following IFN treatment but only constitutive IRF-2 and IFN-induced IRF-1 binding to the HPV-16 IRE was detected. Rather than relying on sequence analysis to identify IFN-responsive cis elements in HPV-16, we performed mobility shift assays, as described above, using an array of overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides spanning the entire 1 kb upstream regulatory region. Interestingly, no Stat-1 or IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 binding was detected in the HPV-16 IRE or elsewhere in the major early promoter of HPV-16 (M.J.Lace, T.H.Haugen and L.P.Turek, unpublished data). We also monitored the transcription of Stat-responsive and IRF-responsive cellular promoters, pIRF-1 and pIRF-2, respectively, in primary HFK in RNase protection assays following IFN treatment ( Figure  2B ). We found that IFN-b activates the expression of both IRF-1and Stat-1-responsive targets in vivo. Taken together, these results confirm that critical IFN-mediated IRF and Stat pathways are intact and functional in primary keratinocytes, the natural host cells for HPV infection.",

We compared the activities of IRF-and Stat-responsive targets ( Figure 2C ) with the HPV-16 promoter in chloramphenicol acetyl transferase assays performed in both uninfected primary HFK and an HPV-positive keratinocyte line-I that harbors a single integrated HPV-16 genome ( Figure 2D and E, respectively). The HPV-16 and IRF-responsive IRF-2 promoters were comparably induced in both cell types, whereas the IFN-unresponsive AdE2 promoter target was not, indicating that the IRF-2 and HPV-16 promoters could be induced by the same mechanism. Furthermore, the observed induction was unaffected by the expression of viral gene products, E6 and E7, from the integrated HPV-16 genome in the HPV-positive keratinocyte line-I cells. Mutation of the HPV-16 IRE that abolished IRF binding, abrogated IFN-mediated activation. We also tested the response of the HPV-16 and HPV-11 E6-E7 promoters to IFN in the context of the intact viral genomes in transfected HeLa cultures-a cell line that does not support HPV replication. Transcription from the HPV-16 ( Figure 3A ) and HPV-11 wt ( Figure 3B ) genomes was activated upon IFN treatment, whereas the corresponding IRE mut was unresponsive in each case, demonstrating that, in the context of the whole genome, IRF-1 binding to the promoter-proximal IRE was required for IFN-mediated activation of HPV transcription in vivo. Furthermore, the presence of endogenous levels of early viral gene products, including E2, failed to influence IFN-mediated induction of HPV transcription. Interestingly, disruption of the IRE in HPV-16 and HPV-11 resulted in increased basal transcription from these templates in the absence of IFN ( Figure 3A and B, respectively). Since mutation of the IRE also impinges on an overlapping E2-binding site, we disrupted the E2 DNA-binding domain alone or in combination with the IRE mutation in HPV-16 to delineate the contribution of E2 versus IRF-1 to this effect ( Figure 3C ). We found that the higher basal activity of the HPV-11 and HPV-16 IRE mutant constructs in these and subsequent experiments were solely due to the loss of E2 binding to a site overlapping the IRE.",

Subsequent experiments performed in our laboratory (M.J.Lace, J.R.Anson and L.P.Turek, unpublished data) have confirmed that the rapid loss of HPV plasmids upon IFN treatment of these keratinocyte cultures occurs via an IRE-independent mechanism.

The IFN-dependent induction requires the binding of IRF-1 to a conserved IRE detected in major early promoters of HPVs associated with anogenital carcinomas and diseases of the head and neck.

In contrast, only 22% of cutaneous HPV types examined revealed IRE sequence matches, suggesting a mechanism conserved among mucosal HPVs but possibly distinct from cutaneous HPVs. However, in contrast to previous studies that relied solely on purified proteins or cellular extracts forming complexes with chromatin-free DNA segments of the HPV-16 promoter in vitro, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that quantitatively defined the binding of physiologic levels of IRF-1 to intact, replicating extrachromosomal HPV-16 genomes. We demonstrate for the first time in this study that IRF-2 also binds the HPV-16 IRE and that basal levels of DNA-binding competent IRF-1 exceed those of IRF-2 by .2-fold in keratinocytes. This pattern was not seen in extracts derived from other human and animal cell types where IRF-2 binding exceeds that of IRF-1 and this contrast did not correlate with differential steady state IRF messenger RNA levels in the absence of IFN treatment (M.J.Lace, T.H.Haugen and L.P.Turek, unpublished data). Interestingly, we detected no binding of IFN-inducible Stat-1 dimers or interferonstimulated gene factor-3 complexes to the 1 kb HPV-16 early promoter in vitro using mobility shift or chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other members of the Stat or IRF family of transcription factors may play a role in regulation of HPV transcription and replication at various stages of the viral life cycle.",

Previous studies had reported IFN-dependent reduction of HPV-31 copy numbers in keratinocyte cultures when high IFN doses were used (57) . Similarly, IFN treatment of bovine papillomavirus type 1 transformed cultures resulted in the loss of bovine papillomavirus plasmids (58) . In both studies, the IFN concentrations used were two orders of magnitude greater than the reproducibly effectual dose employed in our assays. The IFNdependent induction of HPV transcription, initial plasmid amplification and plasmid copy numbers in keratinocytes was revealed by careful titration of the IFN dose coupled with stringent tissue culture conditions.",

However, IFNs are pleiotropic mediators capable of activating multiple Interferon activates HPV transcription and replication cellular pathways in vivo. In contrast to previous studies, we utilized IRF knockout cell lines to resolve the complex interplay of IFN-dependent signaling pathways and define their effects on critical initial events influencing HPV persistence. These critical assays enabled us to identify the specific pathway responsible for the observed IFN-dependent HPV transcription phenotypes. The IFNmediated stimulation of early HPV gene transcription was solely dependent on the induction of the IRF-1 pathway, presumably through initial phosphorylation of extant levels of the IRF-1 protein and supported by increased Stat-dependent IRF-1 expression. The transient nature of IRF-1-dependent effects following IFN treatment can be explained by limited IRF-1 messenger RNA and/or protein stability coupled with the eventual increase in IRF-2 expression that could competitively displace IRF-1 from its shared cognate binding motif to function as a DNA-binding repressor of IFN-responsive targets (53) . The transient IFNdependent induction of HPV early gene transcription and IRF expression observed in this study is consistent with the kinetics of this mechanism. Transient HPV induction is also consistent with a strategy of tightly regulated viral gene expression and genome amplification that would limit cellular responses to viral infection potentially triggered by unrestricted viral replication or elevated levels of viral gene products.",

As the IFN-mediated loss of plasmid copy number appears to be independent of the IRF pathway (this study), it probably competes with cytokine-dependent induction of plasmid replication in vivo to stabilize a homeostatic viral load in persistently infected keratinocytes. Therefore, when the IRE-dependent induction pathway is disabled, a significant decrease in overall plasmid replication and concomitant HPV copy number is revealed. At higher IFN doses, this alternate pathway appears to be kinetically dominant, resulting in a rapid loss of viral plasmids. This as yet undefined mechanism of HPV plasmid attenuation may account for partial clearance of HPV load following high therapeutic doses of IFN. However, following high-dose IFN treatment, any residual viral genomes could be restimulated after physiologic levels of IFN are restored, potentially resulting in a renewed cycle of HPV persistence and malignant progression.",

(A) Synthetic oligonucleotides (shown in upper case while adjacent sequences are shown as lower case) spanning a putative IRE in the HPV-16 P97 promoter and 10 other HPVs (boxed area). Nucleotide substitutions (shaded) disrupting IRF binding were introduced into a conserved IRE motif in HPV-16, HPV-11 and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (ISG15 promoter) control sequence. Adjacent tataa boxes are underlined. (B) Specific cellular complexes formed with the HPVoligonucleotide probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The composite cellular IRF complex consists of IRF-1 and IRF-2 while papillomavirus regulatory factor binding to HPV-16 had been described previously(55). Recombinant IRF proteins (rIRF-1 and rIRF-2) formed specific complexes with defined cellular ISRE, from the IFN-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) and guanylate binding protein (GBP) promoters, as well as the HPV-16 wt IRE. Polyclonal antisera specific for each IRF protein was used to supershift these complexes. (C) Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed with extracts derived from SCC13 cells transfected with HPV-16 wt plasmids. Antiserum, specific for histone 2A (aH2A), was included as a positive control in this composite of two independent experiments. HA refers to the hemagglutinin antisera control. Relative immunoprecipitation activity was expressed as a ratio of HPV-16 immunoprecipitation signal to the truncated competitor PCR product, measured by scanning densitometry.M.J.Lace et al.",
