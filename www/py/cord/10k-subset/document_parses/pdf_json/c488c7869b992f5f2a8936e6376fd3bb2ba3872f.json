An image segmentation and postprocessing software workflow was developed using CellProfiler [21] . Cell counts per well produced in the Cell Profiler image analysis were further processed using quantile normalization to correct for data distributional differences induced by factors such as time-dependent stain degradation and other plate-handling artefacts. Quantile-normalized data were then analysed using statistical linear mixed effects regression models to compare cell counts under the siRNA condition with counts under the control condition, adjusted for technical artefacts of well position and plate effects, thereby yielding plate-normalized growth effect estimates for each siRNA. Well position effects were assessed by screening additional plates containing the same control condition in all wells. Plate effects were assessed by using multiple plates for each condition, thereby allowing for adjustment of plate-to-plate variability in the statistical model. The model-estimated cell count under the siRNA condition was then divided by the model-estimated cell count under the control condition to produce an overall measure of relative effect. Measured effects were ranked from smallest to largest, and the latter (those reducing cell growth by 75% or more) were selected for further study.

This behaviour is distinct from many immortalized mammary epithelial cells lines, including MCF10A ( Figure 2 ), in which colony formation at low epithelial cell density occurs with high efficiency independent of a fibroblast feeder layer (growth at 0 fibroblasts).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 399, "end": 403, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 506, "end": 510, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1353, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1358, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 691, "end": 700, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 724, "end": 734, "text": "Figure S1D", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 944, "end": 954, "text": "Figure S1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1075, "text": "Figures S1B and S1C", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1155, "text": "Figure S1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1227, "text": "Figure S1C", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1305, "text": "Figure S1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1694, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1883, "end": 1891, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "We next compared the three-dimensional growth characteristics of 184-hTERT-L9 with flow-sorted primary mammary epithelial cells and with MCF10A cells [36] .

The primary screen was used for initial hit identification, and multiple secondary screens focused on transmembrane and extracellular protein encoding genes were used to reconfirm and explore the genes implicated ( Figure 3A ). For the primary and secondary screening assays ( Figure 3A ), a layer of freshly irradiated murine NIH 3T3 cells was left to adhere for 24 hours prior to addition of a low density of 184-hTERT-L9 cells. After an additional 24 hours, these co-cultures were robotically transfected with the siRNA pools. Although two cell types were present in the assay, two features of the assay were used to bias the primary screen RNAi responses to the epithelial cells. First, the transfection conditions used for the epithelial cells were not capable of efficiently inducing RNAi transcript/protein knockdown in irradiated fibroblast cells (Additional file 5: Figures S3B and S3C ), even with species-specific siRNAs (murine \u03b2-actin for NIH 3T3 cells, human GAPDH for IMR-90). The reduced capacity of irradiated versus nonirradiated fibroblasts to mediate RNAi was further demonstrated (Additional file 5: Figures S3A and S3D) using universally cell-lethal positive control siRNA (siTOX; Dharmacon) and siRNA to PLK, showing that irradiation abrogates the functional effects of these positive controls (Additional file 5: Figure S3D ), although irradiated fibroblasts are still capable of executing cell death programs. Second, the siRNA library used is human-specific, whereas the fibroblasts are mouse-derived, so any siRNAs entering the cell would be of reduced effectiveness. It is important to note that, in order to confirm that growth effects were related to gene activity in the epithelial cells, all subsequent secondary screen revalidation experiments were carried out either in feeder-free conditions or with transfection into epithelial cells undertaken before placement onto a feeder layer. To quantify cell growth, we counted the number of nuclei per well 4 days after transfection with automated image recognition in duplicate assay plates [21] . In the co-culture conditions we used, changes in total nuclear count reflected the number of epithelial cells present, irrespective of the fixed number of nondividing feeder cells present per well (Additional file 6: Figure S2A ). The primary screen (two replicates per condition) resulted in the identification of 2,337 genes (of 21,121 (11.1%)) in which knockdown led to a statistically significant decrease (adjusted P-value <0.05 by Benjamini-Hochberg analysis) in cell growth to less than 25% of the control condition ( Figure 3B and Additional file 7: Table S2A ). We noted that several receptors for required components of the defined growth media were ranked in the top 50% ( Figure 3B ) of growth effects (insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), isoproterenol and transferrin).

Even among the stable clones derived, fibroblast-dependent growth was reduced. In total, 34 (72.3%) of 47 of the transmembrane and/or extracellular space protein encoding transcripts appeared to be required for epithelial cell growth, as determined by siRNA pool deconvolution and/or by knockdown with a second gene RNAi method (shRNA) (Additional file 6: Figure S2B and Additional file 7: Table S2C ). The increase and decrease in cell numbers observed in the primary and secondary screens likely resulted from a mix of proliferation (cell division) and apoptosis. To determine the relationship and relative contribution of these two factors, we quantified caspase 3/7 activity and proliferation simultaneously by using high-content live cell imaging (see IncuCyte ZOOM description in the Methods section). We observed that there was an inverse correlation (Additional file 8: Figure S4B (rank correlation \u22120.954) and Additional file 9: Figure S5 (rank correlation, \u22120.959)) between caspase activity and the rate of cell increase (determined as AUC over time). We verified that cell proliferation measured by high-content live cell imaging as AUC over time was positively correlated with the fraction of cells in S-phase, which we determined by EdU incorporation (Additional file 8: Figure S4A (rank correlation, 0.735)). The relationship between caspase activation and proliferation was similar, regardless of whether the epithelial cells were grown in feeder-free conditions (Additional file 8: Figure S4B ) or with a feeder monolayer (Additional file 9: Figure S5 ) (feeder to no-feeder rank correlation, 0.892; P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in randomization test). Taken together, these data show that the genes of greatest effect on cell growth tend to affect both proliferation (cell cycle) and caspase activation (apoptosis). Some exceptions were noted, such as the EDG (LPAR3) receptor, where the effect on proliferation was higher in rank than the degree of apoptosis. Functional annotation clustering was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Database, with enrichment based upon the Gene Ontology biological process for the 47 genes required for 184-hTERT-L9 growth [39] . Enrichment scores were generated based upon the functional classification of these genes and denote the relatedness of a seemingly heterogeneous group of genes (Additional file 7: Table S2F ). Notably, a number of guidance factors required for neuronal development are necessary for fibroblast-driven mammary epithelial cell growth [40, 41] . Also enriched are clusters of genes involved in axon guidance, signal transduction through protein kinase cascades, intracellular ion homeostasis, GPCR signalling and cell migration (Additional file 10: Figure S6B ). Additional file 10: Figure S6A displays the axon guidance pathway in which SEMA3C, and part of its receptor complex, PLXNA2, ROBO3, EFNA4, NTN1 and NTN2L from our target gene list, are all highlighted. Axon guidance molecules are increasingly recognized to play a role in mammary gland development and breast tumourigenesis [42] , and our data significantly strengthen this association. We considered the possibility that some of the 47 genes identified may have differential expression in the luminal and basal developmental lineages, and therefore we inspected flow-sorted RNA-seq libraries of mammary lumen and myoepithelium (three independent pairs from the RNA-seq library; see Additional file 11: Table S3 and discussion of NIH Canadian Roadmap Epigenomics mammary epithelial cell RNA-seq libraries in the Methods section).

First, using acinar formation in short-term culture as a growth measure (that is, counting three-dimensional structures formed after plating cells at low density, as in a two-dimensional colony-forming assay), we determined the requirement for each gene using siRNA knockdown. As siRNA transfection complexes cannot effectively penetrate Matrigel, we transfected cells in culture for 48 hours prior to harvesting and replating them in Matrigel [45] . We determined that siRNA silencing was effective for up to 10 days in Matrigel cultures of 184-hTERT-L9.

Strikingly, both the two-dimensional and threedimensional assays showed that several GPCRs appeared to be required for epithelial cell growth, including LPAR3, one of three major receptors for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In transgenic mouse models, overexpression of each of these individual LPA receptors (LPAR1, LPAR2 and LPAR3) under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) promoter led to the formation of late-onset mammary carcinomas [46] .

(A) Irradiated murine NIH 3T3 cells do not efficiently mediate RNAi with a universal cell-lethal siRNA. Irradiated NIH 3T3 cells at a density of 30,000 cells/cm 2 were transfected with increasing concentrations of transfection reagent. After 48 hours, live-dead discrimination was performed (calcein AM/ethidium homodimer 1) and enumerated using the IN Cell Analyzer and IN Cell Developer software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The percentage of viable cells was determined in comparison to nontransfected control wells. Error bars represent standard deviation (n = 2). (B) Irradiated fibroblasts do not show protein target knockdown. Irradiated NIH 3T3 cells at a density of 10,000 cells/cm 2 were transfected with 50 nM pooled siRNAs targeting \u03b2-actin complexed with increasing transfection reagent concentrations. After 96 hours, \u03b2-actin (green) and lamin C (red) levels were detected using the LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE, USA). (C) Irradiated fibroblasts do not show protein target knockdown. Irradiated IMR-90 human fibroblasts at a density of 10,000 cells/cm 2 were transfected with 50 nM pooled siRNAs targeting human GAPDH, with transfection reagent alone (Lipofectamine 2000) and with a nontargeting siRNA (siCon3) as controls.

Nontransfected cells (Lipofectamine 2000) were included as the control. Cell number was not above starting and/or control conditions for the irradiated fibroblasts, as expected, given their arrested state. Application of siTOX to the irradiated cells had no significant effect on irradiated cell viability (no difference from controls; Dunnett-adjusted P > 0.05). In contrast, in the nonirradiated cells, both siPLK1 and siTOX result in cell killing compared to the control (Dunnett-adjusted P < 0.02).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
