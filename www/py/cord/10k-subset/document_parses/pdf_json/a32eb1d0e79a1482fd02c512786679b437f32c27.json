            "text": "Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin, which is believed to play an important role in the innate immunity against a variety of pathogens. MBL can bind to sugar determinants of a wide variety of microorganisms, neutralize them and inhibit infection by complement activation through the lectin pathway and opsonization by collectin receptors. Given that small intestine is a predominant site of extrahepatic expression of MBL, here we addressed the question whether MBL is involved in mucosal innate immunity. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) genes of mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant mMBL-C-CRD binds to Shigella flexneri 2a in a calcium-dependent manner and that interaction could be blocked by the anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody. mMBL-C-CRD protein could inhibit the adhesion of S. flexneri 2a to intestinal mucosa, while administration of anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody caused an increased level of bacteria adhesion in vitro. Administration of recombinant mMBL-C-CRD protein reduced the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 from primary intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with S. flexneri 2a. Furthermore, neutralization of MBL activity by anti-MBL-C-CRD resulted in a significant increase in the number of S. flexneri 2a that colonized the intestines of BALB/c mice and attenuated the severity of inflammation seen in the areas of bacterial invasion. These findings suggest that mMBL-C may protect host intestinal mucosa by directly binding to the bacteria.",

The overall polypeptide structure of MBL includes a cysteine-rich N-terminal domain, a collagen-like region, a neck region and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (3, 4) . The CRD has been shown to bind mannose, mannan, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine (4) . The cluster of CRDs rendered by oligomerization is thought to be suitable for binding polymeric sugars on microbes (5) . Indeed, MBL can selectively recognize sugars presented on pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, yeast and leishmania via the CRD (6) . In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that MBL can inhibit influenza A virus infection independent of complement activation (7) . Other groups showed that MBL can interfere with the viral attachment to host cells, thus affecting viral spread and release (8) (9) (10) .",

Both MBLs are mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and presented in liver and serum (13) . However, extrahepatic expression of MBL was reported in various tissues. Indeed, non-hepatic mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) expression is highest in the small intestine (14) . It is known that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can produce cytokines and chemokines that are crucial for the recruitment and activation of immune cells (15, 16) .

Digested cells were washed three times by centrifugation at 120 3 g for 3 min in DMEM plus 2% sorbitol. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates. One hour before plating cells, culture surfaces were coated with Matrigel (Sigma-Aldrich). Epithelial cells were cultured in phenol-red-free DMEM with the following additives: 5 mg of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) per milliliter, 100 lg of heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng of epidermal growth factor (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) per milliliter, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U of penicillin per milliliter, 100 lg of streptomycin per milliliter, 0.2% D-glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C with periodic supplementation of medium to maintain a volume of 1 milliliter per well. To confirm the epithelial nature of the cells, expression of cytokeratin was determined by using FITC-labeled monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).",

The ability of shigella to invade and colonize the intestinal epithelium, in association with an intense inflammatory response leading to the destruction of the colonic mucosa, is central to shigellosis.

As shown in Fig. 7 , no or only a small numbers of streptomycin-resistant S. flexneri 2a were recovered from intestinal tissues in untreated mice or mice receiving control IgG. However, Fig. 2 .

Most studies have explored the roles of MBL in relation to the acquisition of an infectious organism (susceptibility) and the nature of the associated clinical course (severity) (24) . In the present study, we have demonstrated that mMBL-C directly interacts with S. flexneri 2a and that mMBL-C on intestinal villous epithelial cells is involved in protection from bacterial infection. Our results support the well-documented roles of MBL-C in host defense. A number of studies have shown that low levels of MBL contribute to the severity of illness in infections of pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (25) (26) (27) . Animal studies also showed that MBL-null mice are indeed highly susceptible to S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa systemic infection (28, 29) .",

Based on our data, we postulate that MBL may directly inhibit the interaction of microorganism with target cells through its CRD. Supporting evidence also came from the studies of gastrointestinal mucins, which has been shown to compete with underlying epithelium for binding to pathogens, resulting in reduced attachment of pathogens to the mucosal IECs for colonization (32, 33) .
