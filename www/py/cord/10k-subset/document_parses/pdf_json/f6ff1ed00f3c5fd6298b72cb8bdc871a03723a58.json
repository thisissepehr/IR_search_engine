This study is designed to investigate the role of DAD in ARDS patients who underwent open lung biopsy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all ARDS patients who met the Berlin definition and underwent open lung biopsy from January 1999 to January 2014 in a referred medical center. DAD is characterized by hyaline membrane formation, lung edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and alveolar epithelial cell injury. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, severity of ARDS, clinical and pathological diagnoses, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 1838 patients with ARDS were identified and open lung biopsies were performed on 101 patients (5.5 %) during the study period. Of these 101 patients, the severity of ARDS on diagnosis was mild of 16.8 %, moderate of 56.5 % and severe of 26.7 %. The hospital mortality rate was not significant difference between the three groups (64.7 % vs 61.4 % vs 55.6 %, p = 0.81). Of the 101 clinical ARDS patients with open lung biopsies, 56.4 % (57/101) patients had DAD according to biopsy results. The proportion of DAD were 76.5 % (13/17) in mild, 56.1 % (32/57) in moderate and 44.4 % (12/27) in severe ARDS and there is no significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.113). Pathological findings of DAD patients had a higher hospital mortality rate than non-DAD patients (71.9 % vs 45.5 %, p = 0.007). Pathological findings of DAD (odds ratio: 3.554, 95 % CI, 1.385-9.12; p = 0.008) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on the biopsy day (odds ratio: 1.424, 95 % CI, 1.187-1.707; p<0.001) were significantly and independently associated with hospital mortality. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were not significantly different between DAD and non-DAD patients.

Second, the decision to perform open lung biopsy was highly selective and only 5.5 % of patients with ARDS were referred for biopsy in this study. The results, therefore, are unlikely to be representative of all patients with ARDS. However, the potential for selection bias for patients with ARDS may be lower with open lung biopsy than with autopsy as the patients are alive. Third, only 85 % of patients had BAL before open lung biopsy. Some specific diagnoses may have been missed because their recognition depended on the availability of laboratory facilities. Fourth, the lung specimens were assessed by one pulmonary pathologist only and so the possibility of individual interpretation bias should be considered. Finally, there was no standard treatment for patients with some specific diagnoses, such as interstitial lung disease, after the biopsy result became available. Specific treatments such as corticosteroid therapy might have influenced the survival outcome in these patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This retrospective study demonstrated that 56.4 % of selected patients with ARDS based on the Berlin definition and who underwent open lung biopsy were identified as having DAD. As a result of the moderate agreement between clinical and pathological diagnosis of ARDS, open lung biopsy may be considered in some patients to exclude or to clarify the diagnosis. According to the results of pathological examination, patients with DAD had poorer outcomes than patients without DAD.
