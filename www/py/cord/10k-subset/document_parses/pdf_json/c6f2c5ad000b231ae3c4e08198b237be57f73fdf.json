The original male was then mated to his sparse-coated daughters, and in May 1969 the first hairless young were observed. Breeding data given in Table 1 indicate that the condition is caused by an autosomal semi-dominant mutation resembling \"naked\" in the mouse. Because of this resemblance, the name \"naked\" with the gene symbol N is proposed for this mutant. Homozygous naked hamsters are completely devoid of hair apart from a very short and soft down (Fig. 1 ). Vibrissae are present but are soft and tend to be bent. Naked hamsters which reach weaning age are viable, though they have a reduced body weight, and are probably more sensitive to environmental factors than normal hamsters. Both male and female homozygotes are fertile though the few females that have produced young have so far been unable to rear them. The breeding data shown in Table 1 indicate that there is about a 30% deficiency of homozygotes at weaning, thus the effect on viability is much less marked than the naked mutant in the mouse 3 \u2022 The onset of the condition has not been studied in detail, but naked individuals are identifiable at about 14 days of age, and there is no evidence of hair growth from then onwards.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1136, "end": 1139, "text": "3 \u2022", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 273, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 576, "end": 583, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 971, "end": 978, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "New Semi-dominant Mutation in the Syrian Hamster"}, {"text": "Heterozygotes are identifiable from about 14 days of age onwards by their sparse coat, which is particularly deficient on the ventral surface, though the nature of the deficiency has not yet been determined.

His description that the massage pretreatment applied to Ricinus stems in my experiments was \"gentle\" is not correct. The theory behind the method is to compress phloem sieve tubes containing sap under pressure of about 10 bar, so as to make it surge rapidly along the tubes; manual pressure was applied firmly though not so as to produce detectable damage during the application. Similarly the brief application of quite strong pressure is needed to stop exudation completely. He describes as \"contrived\" my proposals for the sieve plates as control systems, governed by sealing and anti-sealing mechanisms, in view of the \" obvious\" alternative that the pretreatment merely disrupts the natural system. Yet callose deposition, one accepted sieveplate sealing mechanism, is known to be reversible 3 \u2022 Further evidence supporting my theory will be published shortly 4 in which illustrations of the complexity of the sealing system are presented. For example, a cut may exude, then stop completely for a time, begin again without interference and finally cease (the \"re-bleed phenomenon\"), which defies a simple explanation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phloem Physiology and Protective Sealing Mechanisms"}, {"text": "A further important finding is that Ricinus plants may exude considerable amounts of sap without pretreatment if they are grown sufficiently vigorously 5 \u2022 Such exudation can also be stopped by the temporary application of pressure. More than 3 mi. of phloem exudate has been collected from a single 5 mm cut in an unmassaged plant about 50 em tall (Baker and Hall, unpublished result), whereas the corresponding maximum on record from a single cut in a vigorous massaged plant is now more than 10 mi. This rapid collection of phloem sap from plants in amounts too large to be accounted for by turgor release from single cells is a most serious obstacle to acceptance of an \"occluded pore\" mechanism. Not only is massage pretreatment inessential, but the amounts collected above and below cuts are in roughly equal amounts as one might expect of a simple pressure release. We should expect the output from a pumping system between leaves and roots to be polarized and produce dissimilar amounts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phloem Physiology and Protective Sealing Mechanisms"}, {"text": "It is surprising that the palm sugar industry, which produces thousands of tons of sugar annually from phloem exudate 6 , has been so ignored by plant physiologists. It was from Bose's account' of the collection system that my successful massage pretreatment was devised. There are local variations in technique but my enquiries into these have been curtailed by the Pakistan troubles. But an eyewitness, Mr Syed Hadiuzzaman of Dacca University, has described a method for the collection of Phoenix phloem sap without massage pretreatment, by \"V\" shaped incisions alone. Experts incise the upper trunks after removal of a series of leaf bases, which otherise protect the tissues from injury. Cuts are renewed every few days and provide severallitres of sap (about 14% sucrose) per day. Thus it seems that the mechanisms involved are similar in Phoenix and Ricinus and pretreatment by \"disruptive\" massage is not essential for exudation from either.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phloem Physiology and Protective Sealing Mechanisms"}, {"text": "In terms of evolutionary development it can be argued 3 \u2022 4 that such a rich potential food supply as phloem has become adapted to seal rapidly to withstand the onslaught of predators.

MILBURN DR SPANNER writes: I am grateful to Dr Milburn for correcting the wrong impression given by my use of \"gently\". Further thought on his interesting results inclines me to greater sympathy with his view. My reaction had been to conclude that his metabolic sealing-antisealing mechanism had involved P-protein, a conclusion against which strong arguments have been raised 1 \u2022 If he is thinking rather of callose formation I find his suggestions plausible. But in that case they seem to me to lose their relevance to the controversy about whether the sieve plate pores are normally occupied by P-protein, as my Fig. 1 indicated 10 \u2022 One only has to assume that the usual brevity of exudation hinges on the formation of callose rather than on the filling of the pores with P-protein to see this. For I believe that the electro-osmotically significant P-protein in the pores does not require very much force to displace it. (I am not thinking, of course, of massive protein plugs in the lumen.) Consequently the situation at the cut surface is dominated by the huge turgor gradient, and pays little attention to whether the pores are normally open or occluded. That exudation from the two surfaces of the cut should be more or less equal (not always found inci dentally 11 ) is understandable. Similarly the re-bleed phenomenon does not seem so hard to explain; pressure build-up might dislodge a proteinaceous accumulation at a callose-constricted sieve plate.Bedford College, University of London, Regent's Park, London NWl 4NS", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "11 )", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 623, "end": 629, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}]}
