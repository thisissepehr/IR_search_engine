Early in the SARS outbreak, BGI staff members traveled to the epidemic center in Southern China to get virus samples, only to come back empty-handed. The official reason given was that the safety regulations banned the transfer of the virus, but suspicion was rampant that competition between research institutions and political influence hampered the collaboration. \"It's like you have a lawnmower in your hand, but other people are trying to do the job with paper cutters,\" says Yu Jun from the BGI. The virus did not enter BGI until a group at the BCCA Genome Sciences Centre in Vancouver, Canada had posted the entire genome sequence of the virus on the Internet. With more cooperation, coordination and political will, the Chinese group would have had an opportunity to showcase Chinese science all over the world and help in an initiative to battle a disease that was most devastating to the Chinese population 28 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": ".

Under China's 'planned' economy, public research institutions played a central role in science innovation. There was a complex structure in which each institute had a relatively well-defined mission. The institutes fell under the control of various central and state governmental units, including The State Council (Beijing), Ministry of National Defense (Beijing), Ministry of Health (Beijing), Ministry of Education (Beijing) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing). Some of them, such as the institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were heavily involved in basic research.
