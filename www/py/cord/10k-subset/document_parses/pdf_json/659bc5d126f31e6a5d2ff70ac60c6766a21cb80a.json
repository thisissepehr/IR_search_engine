It is clear that pathogenic agents causing overt disease represent a serious hazard to research results in both shortas well as long-term studies.

This makes research less reliable because of the more subtle effects of the silent infections, especially in longterm studies as in aging research. The establishment of animal colonies that were free from these (micro-) organisms has increased substantially the value of animals used in biomedical research. Characterization of the health status and microbiological monitoring of the animals in experiments are particularly important.

Programs to assess the health status of rodents, and characterize their microbiological status were improved, and monitoring data thereafter showed that breeders were able to produce and supply clean, specified pathogen free (SPF) animals (15, 16) . However, there was only a little improvement in the ability of a great number of institutional and research facilities to maintain their laboratory animals free from infectious agents.
