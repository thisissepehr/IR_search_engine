            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease, thought to be caused by a novel coronavirus, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 On 15 March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that SARS is now \"a worldwide health threat\". 3 The recent outbreak of SARS in Singapore was triggered by a Singaporean traveler who returned from Hong Kong to Singapore at the end of February 2003. She was admitted on 1 March 2003 with symptoms consistent with the WHO criteria for SARS. She had stayed on the same hotel floor as another hotel guest who was eventually identified as the source patient for the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, and who was also epidemiologically linked to the outbreak in Toronto, Canada. 4, 5 The clinical manifestations and the ensuing epidemic of the Singaporean index case have been described elsewhere. 6 Here we report the first in-flight transmission of SARS, related to the SARS outbreak in Singapore. A 22year-old previously well Singaporean flight attendant of Chinese ethnicity was working on the flight from New York to Singapore on 14 March 2003. One of the passengers was a doctor who had attended to the abovementioned index case in Singapore from 3 to 9 March, at a time when the diagnosis of SARS was not known and respiratory and contact precautions were not yet in place. He had been feeling unwell since 9 March, with high fever and dry cough. 7 After the Singapore Ministry of Health alerted the airline to the possibility of SARS (which was subsequently confirmed 7 ), he was kept isolated in the back of the plane. The contact of the stewardess with him was brief, and only involved serving and picking up the food tray. Almost no communication took place, and the patient recalled that she kept a distance of more than 1 m between her and the doctor.",

As, to date, no randomized controlled studies on ribavirin in SARS patients have been conducted, it is unclear whether her improvement was due to ribavirin or was just part of the natural course of her illness. It may also be possible that her contact with the SARS patient was brief, and therefore the viral inoculum lower, compared to contacts with repeated or prolonged exposure. She certainly had no risk factors known to be associated with a worse outcome such as advanced age, high LDH and co-morbidity. 2 This is the first reported case of in-flight transmission; however, the mass media have since highlighted and dramatized further cases of transmission of SARS on airplanes, consistent with the explosively evolving epidemiology of this disease. Systematic studies are imperative, to determine the real risk of in-flight transmission.",

However, from the Singapore and Canada experience we have learned that it only takes one imported case to trigger off an epidemic in another country. 5, 6 The implementation of effective screening to prevent SARS patients from boarding airplanes is therefore crucial, not only to prevent in-flight transmission, but also to prevent the introduction of this disease to other countries. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has published interim guidelines on how to deal with airline passengers with symptoms suggestive of SARS and how to protect flight crew members (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ flight_crew_guidelines.htm).",
