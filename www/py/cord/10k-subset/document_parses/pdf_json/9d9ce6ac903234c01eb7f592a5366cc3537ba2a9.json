Focusing specifically on the threat from bioterrorism, it draws on a broadly constructivist approach to risk, and highlights how ideas around political rationalities, styles of thought, forms of risk and frameworks of knowledge can be useful in thinking about emerging biosecurity policies. It suggests that a comparative study of Britain and the United States might help to clarify how the threat of bioterrorism is being constructed by various groups, how support for particular 'framings' of the threat is being mobilized and taken up in policy networks, and how this is linked to different courses of action in response to the possibility of bioterrorism.",

            "text": "The financial disparity between the two countries is paralleled by a significant disproportion in the number and scale of initiatives set up to tackle bioterrorism. In the US, an array of threat and vulnerability assessment exercises, prevention and protection efforts, surveillance and detection programmes, and response and recovery initiatives have been set up since 2001. Through the 'Biodefense for the 21st Century' presidential directive of April 2004, a Homeland Security Biodefense Complex has been developed. This complex is a nationwide group of institutions, and includes as its centrepiece the Department of (1) the National Bioforensic Analysis Centre, which will conduct forensic analysis of material recovered following a biological attack with the aim of attaining a 'biological fingerprint' to identify the perpetrators and determine the origin and method of attack; and (2) the Biological Threat Characterization Centre, which will conduct studies and laboratory experiments 'to better understand current and future biological threats, assess vulnerabilities, conduct risk assessments, and determine potential impacts in order to guide the development of countermeasures such as detectors, drugs, vaccines, and decontamination technologies to protect the US against these threats ' (DHS Fact Sheet, 2005) . In addition to the NBACC facility, the Homeland Security Biodefense Complex also includes the Plum Island Animal Disease Control Center-another site connected with the 1950s and 1960s US offensive biological weapons programme-as well as the Biodefense Knowledge Center at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ten newly established, university-based Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense, and the eleven high containment laboratories currently under construction. Biomedical research to develop therapies and diagnostic tools to counter biological attacks forms a large component of the US response to the threat of bioterrorism. Nearly 1,000 biodefence-related projects have been awarded since 2001, primarily through DHHS ( Figure 3 ) (Lentzos, in press) . Educational institutions (both public and private) have been the main recipients of these projects by far, receiving in both 2003 and 2004 nearly double, and in 2005 more than double, the number awarded to industry. Industry, however, has consistently received a substantially larger number of projects than both government institutions (federal, state and local) and other (non-profit, non-educational) institutions. Of the projects awarded in the 1995-2005 period, 26 per cent targeted viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF, e.g. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa Fever, Dengue, etc.) , 25 per cent focused on anthrax, 10 per cent focused on smallpox, 9 per cent focused on plague, 6 per cent focused on tularemia, and 5 per cent targeted botulism (Figure 4 ). Project BioShield, signed into law in July 2004, is a ten-year effort to accelerate the awarding process for research grants on medical countermeasures against potential bioterrorism agents. The main goal of the project, however, is to bring biodefence research into the development and manufacturing phases. Recognizing that many medical countermeasures against bioterror agents do not have a natural market and therefore do not attract significant commercial interest, the US government has dedicated $5.6 billion over the next ten years to enable it to act as a guaranteed buyer of successful vaccines, drugs, and other therapies.",

Also in place was the Department of Health's Health Protection Agency, focusing on infectious disease surveillance through its Centre for Infections, and on research through its Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response.

Both countries, for example, have sought technical solutions to the problem of biosecurity, investing particularly in medical countermeasures-or what the Bush administration has labelled 'anti-bioterror products'. These target pathogens like smallpox, anthrax and Ebola for which current vaccines and therapies are inadequate or unavailable, as well as emerging pathogens, like SARS and influenza H5N1 virus, and new pathogens synthesized de novo. Vaccines and therapies are being stockpiled on both sides of the Atlantic. While the particular targets and size of the stockpile are not generally disclosed in the UK, information about the Strategic National Stockpile, or the 'National Repository of Life-Saving Pharmaceuticals and Medical Materiel', is more forthcoming in the US, with the Bush administration, for example, very publicly pledging to stockpile enough smallpox vaccine for every American.",

The British Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the American Bioterrorism Act 2002 both identify pathogens considered particularly at risk of misuse, and restrict access to these. Labelled 'Schedule 5 pathogens' in the UK and 'select agents' in the US, these cover similar, but not identical biological agents and toxins. The development of bioterrorism scenarios is yet another example of similar responses to the threat of bioterrorism in the UK and the US. Most of these exercises are nationally based, but often feature similar scenarios-for example, the American 'Dark Winter' exercise and the British 'Red Scar' exercises have focused on smallpox outbreaks. Some exercises are jointly coordinated between Britain and the US, and a few involve larger number of countries as well as intergovernmental organizations. The 'Top Officials Three' full-scale exercise-the third in the congressionally mandated Top Officials (TOPOFF) series simulating multi-point terrorist attacks using chemical and biological weapons-was jointly conducted with the UK and Canada, where simultaneous, related exercises were carried out. 'Atlantic Storm'-a table-top exercise convened in Washington in January 2005, a couple of months prior to 'Top Officials Three'-was designed to mimic a summit of transatlantic leaders forced to respond to a bioterrorist attack, again focused on smallpox. The transatlantic leaders were played by current and former officials from each country or organization represented, and included the prime ministers of Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom; the presidents of the European Commission, France and the United States; the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany; and the Director General of the World Health Organization.",

Both countries established state-sponsored programmes to develop biological weapons around the Second World War. Biological weapons were initially envisioned as bombs that generated aerosols intended to kill or disable troops in a local area, but this concept was quickly replaced by a vision of biological weapons as huge clouds of germs that would drift with the wind and infect people over large areas. In 1959 Porton Down, the site of the British biological weapons programme, declared an end to its offensive biological projects in favour of defensive research and development. The United States followed a decade later with President Nixon renouncing the US offensive biological weapons programme in 1969, thereby paving the way for the multilateral Biological Weapons Convention, banning the development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons.",

Employing thousands of scientists and technicians, and supported by large research and production facilities, the programme developed in tandem with genetic modification technology and far exceeded the sophistication and capacity the United States had achieved in the 1960s. Like the British and American programmes, the Soviet programme emphasized experiments on infectious agents and aimed for large-scale industrial production for strategic attack. It emulated Western science to increase the power of some germ agents, and with time sought to extend aerial delivery by adding germ warheads to long-range intercontinential missiles.",

The differences in the financial investment and in the number and scale of initiatives set up to tackle bioterrorism in Britain and the United States raise important policy questions. On the one hand, the different responses might suggest the Bush administration is overstating the threat, and consequently investing substantial public resources in unwarranted initiatives and research programmes to the detriment of other, potentially more valuable, endeavours. Indeed, 'dissenting' voices within the US are beginning to question the proportionality of the risk assessment underlying recent spending on biodefence, the credibility of bioterrorist attack scenarios and the necessity of the biodefence research programme (Altman et al., 2005; Enserink and Kaiser, 2005; Miller, 2005) . And as a New Scientist editorial recently noted, since the anthrax letters of autumn 2001 'there has not been a single bioterrorist attack anywhere in the world. Given that the actual risk of such an attack remains unclear, and that experts believe terrorists are far more likely to use conventional explosives because they are easier to handle, has the US reaction been appropriate?

(Noble, 2006) In addition to organizing a series of regional workshops in Africa, Asia and Latin America to encourage recognition and response development to the threat of bioterrorism, Interpol has developed a 'bio-terrorism incident pre-planning and response guide' providing a stepby-step manual for law enforcement in preparing for, and dealing with, a bio-incident. Focusing more specifically on health, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also published a guide on preparedness for and response to the deliberate use of biological agents to cause harm (WHO, 2004) . Running to 340 pages, among other things it sets out a framework of threat analysis, pre-emptive risk-reduction strategies, acquisition of equipment, training, development of procedures, preparation of information and communication packages, and validation of response capabilities. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has developed a programme on biosecurity, organizing workshops on 'Promoting Responsible Stewardship in the Biosciences: Avoiding Potential Abuse of Research and Resources' and 'Biosecurity of Microbial Biological Resources-Complementing Innovation', and setting up a website dedicated to biosecurity, all with a particular emphasis on encouraging innovation and the bioeconomy.",

In other words, in contrast to theorists of the risk society, such as Ulrich Beck and Tony Giddens, but in agreement with other, broadly 'constructivist' approaches to risk such as those of Ian Hacking, Pat O'Malley and Richard Ericson, they argue that risk arises from particular ways of thinking about, seeing and acting upon the world.

A risk portfolio, then, is a way of selecting, out of all possible, real or imagined threats and harms, those that will be the focus of individual or collective attention. This selection is, inescapably, done in relation to moral evaluations pervaded by cultural norms. As I will argue later, in order to understand the divergent British and American perceptions of, and responses to, the threat of bioterrorism, their national risk portfolios must be explored. Such a comparative exploration provides an excellent opportunity to clarify the cultural norms and moral evaluations that place biorisks so high in the risk portfolio of the public, media and politicians in the US, and so much lower in the British risk portfolio.",

The emphasis on political rationalities directs us to an analysis of the changing fields within which political and other forms of authority operate, the discursive framing of the proper objects for political concern, and the proper distribution of tasks among different authorities-states, governments, experts, intermediate bodies, commercial actors, civil society organizations and private citizens. Such an analysis of discourses is in part a matter of language. But language here does not merely 'represent' pre-formed interests or aspirations: it has an active role as a kind of intellectual apparatus for rendering reality thinkable in such a way that it is amenable to political deliberations, and for giving it a salience for others, notably in terms of the affects and ethics with which it engages.",

Brian Balmer's (2001) historical account of British biological warfare policy from the 1930s to the mid-1960s is a useful example here of the role one particular group-scientists-has played in bringing the facts of biothreats into existence. I refer to the various groups as 'thought communities'-an idea I adapt from the work of Ludwik Fleck (1979) to refer to informal communities, not necessarily confined to a single scientific discipline or professional group, but linked by a number of features: they share a particular thought style, they have a common set of reference points and ideas of facts and evidence, they make use of common forms of argument and they share a normative framework.",

Here I focus on the ways in which this can be understood in terms of risk. Risk thinking can, as we know, take many forms. Fran\u00e7ois Ewald has produced some of the most rigorous critical thinking on the genealogy of risk, and his work helps us identify the particular form of risk thinking taking shape around biosecurity. In his analysis of insurantial societies, he argues that: 'Nothing is a risk in itself; there is no risk in reality. But on the other hand, anything can be a risk; it all depends on how one analyzes the danger, considers the event ' (1991: 199) . Insurance, as a technology of risk, 'is first and foremost a schema of rationality, a way of breaking down, rearranging, ordering certain elements of reality ' (1991: 199) . The insurer, then, does not merely register the existence of risk and then offer guarantees against them in some passive way. Rather, he actively produces risks, making 'risks appear where each person had hitherto felt obliged to submit resignedly to the blows of fortune ' (1991: 199-200) . We can identify similar processes in the construction of threats and biorisks: those active in this field do not merely register such threats, they produce them. They bring into existence a potential future in a form that demands action in the present-once threat is transformed into risk, those to whom this discourse is addressed can no longer submit themselves with hope or resignation to a future that will come as it may. They must act, for the future is something for which they now have responsibility.",

It does not follow that scientific expertise is useless, but that it will not release the politician from the sovereignty of his or her decision. (2001: 298) While risk thinking, then, operates in a world that is, in principle at least, amenable to calculation, disciplining the future in probabilistic algorithms, precaution is an attitude born in a future of uncertainty. It therefore creates a different set of obligations on political actors, because decisions are both required and fateful, but always underdetermined by evidence, calculation or expertise. While insurance operates according to a logic of compensation, the attitude of precaution arises where the threats envisaged are of a form that cannot be compensated: 'Precaution, to a certain extent, brings us out of the age of insurance companies. It creates a world in which, in principle, compensation no longer has meaning, because the only rational attitude is to avoid the occurrence of a threat with irreversible consequences ' (2002: 298) . Of course, there is a sense in which Ewald overstates this argument. As Richard Ericson and Aaron Doyle (2004) have shown, in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001, insurance companies did indeed enter the field of catastrophe risks and found means of calculating and insuring against them. And, indeed, in the world of biorisks, we can certainly see the emergence of new forms of expertise, generating new decisional logics. It is, I suggest, these new forms of expertise, the experts of biorisk, who have played a key role in shaping the US and UK responses to the risks of bioterrorism, and the very different forms that the obligations of precaution have taken in these two countries.",

The first is to locate biorisks within the problem spaces, political rationalities and thought communities that bring them into reality as problems to attend to. The second is to clarify the forms that biorisks take, and the extent to which we are moving from a calculation, probability, insurance configuration of risk thinking towards a security, uncertainty, precaution configuration. The third type of denaturalization is to recognize the 'path-dependent' consequences of embracing a particular way of engaging with risk, where heavy investments in certain research and development may irreversibly transform our thinking and the questions we ask.",

By examining the discourses of these groups-the political parties, intelligence and security experts, biological scientists and their professional associations, the military, epidemiologists and health professional, individual firms and the larger biopharmaceutical industry, think tanks, health and safety regulators, civil society, 'dissenting voices', the media-we can consider the nature of the threats envisioned, the authority and evidence they draw on in their risk assessments, and the norms and values that underpin these. And by studying the extent of overlap within the group discourses, the relationships and interactions between the groups, and the degrees of inclusion in the developing policy network-and relating this to pre-existent networks and the broader social, economic and historical context-we can gain some insight into the different courses of action in Britain and the US in response to the possibility of bioterrorism. j",
