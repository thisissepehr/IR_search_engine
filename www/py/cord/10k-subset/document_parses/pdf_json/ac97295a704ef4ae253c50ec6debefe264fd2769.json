A model composed of two interacting complex networks is proposed to describe cooperative spreading processes, wherein the virus spreading in one layer can penetrate into the other to promote the spreading process. The global epidemic threshold of the model is smaller than the epidemic thresholds of the corresponding isolated networks. Thus, global epidemic onset arises in the interacting networks even though an epidemic onset does not arise in each isolated network. Simulations verify the analysis results and indicate that cooperative spreading processes in multiplex networks enhance the final infection fraction. Published by AIP Publishing.

The main focus of studies on this process is on how epidemic spreads in multiplex networks when two spreading processes interact. Epidemic threshold and final infection fraction are the two important parameters underlying any spreading processes, to contrast the two parameters between the interacting networks, and the corresponding isolated networks has practical significance. In this study, a model for cooperative spreading processes on interacting twolayer networks is proposed. This study aims to prove that the epidemic thresholds of interacting two-layer networks can be decreased for cooperative spreading processes, which implies that cooperative spreading processes promote the spread of disease. This study determines that the global epidemic onset arises. Thus, a global epidemic threshold can be used to uniform the two epidemic thresholds. This model can also be used for unidirectional coupled networks. It is revealed that a network with a small epidemic threshold confirms the global epidemic threshold of the multiplex networks.",

Many studies initially focused on isolated networks of fixed topology with mean-field approximation. 1, 2 The spread of sexually transmitted diseases and computer viruses was studied based on scale-free networks. [3] [4] [5] [6] Several studies also revealed that epidemic processes in scale-free networks do not pose an epidemic threshold because of large connectivity fluctuations in infinite scale-free networks. [7] [8] [9] Epidemic spreading was investigated in complex random networks with degree correlations. 10 Then, reaction-diffusion model in which the nodes contain agents [11] [12] [13] [14] was used in the process of spreading. The agents can move from a node to another, and spreading processes occurred within agents on the same node. Further, the studies focus on the mobility of individuals. 15, 16 The movement of individuals among dense crowd in a city has a great effect on the epidemic threshold. A random diffusion model was also used to investigate epidemic spreading among objective traveling people. 17, 18 The railway leads to a fast increase in the number of infected agents and a high final infection fraction. These models and results are very useful for public health authorities to make effective decisions.",

In the real-world, many spreading processes can occur through multiple routes simultaneously. For example, sexually transmitted diseases can spread both in homosexual and heterosexual networks. 19 Avian influenza, such as 2009 H1N1 and 2013 H7N9, has recently made dead-end jumps from poultry to human. 20 Thus, these viruses make challenges to human progress and survival. A natural extension is to use the interacting network model in which epidemic can spread from one network to another. Funk and Jansen 21 used the bond percolation analysis of two competitive viruses in two-layer networks, and the effects of layer overlapping were investigated. A study on U.S. bisexual men showed that the bisexual men were the medium to connect the pathogens from the network of heterosexual men with the network of homosexual men. 22, 23 Dickison et al. 24 studied the susceptible-infectedrefractory (SIR) process and revealed that in strongly coupled networks, epidemics spread from one layer to the other at a critical infection strength b c , below which the disease does not spread. Saumell-Mendiola et al. 25 analyzed an epidemic spreading process of two interacting networks. They also developed a heterogeneous mean-field approach and revealed that a global endemic state may arise in the coupled system even though two networks are well below a) Electronic mail: shcheng@whu.edu.cn b)",

In this study, a model composed of two interacting complex networks is proposed to describe the cooperative spreading processes. First, this model extends spreading process in a single network to cooperative spreading in the two-layer networks. It can also be used to analyze unidirectional or bidirectional interaction between two-layer networks. Second, perturbation analysis theory is used to prove that epidemic thresholds of interacting two-layer networks can be decreased in cooperative spreading processes. This theory reveals that the cooperative interaction between two spread processes can promote spread. Epidemic onset arises in one network and that also arises simultaneously in the other network for the interacting networks. Thus, a global epidemic threshold for interacting networks exists. Finally, this theory also displays that cooperative spreading processes in multiplex network enhance the final infection fraction.",

Thus, the model is a multiplex networks, as shown in Fig. 1 . We focus in the discrete standard susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model 1 for both networks with regard to the spreading dynamics. In each subnetwork, the nodes are denoted as susceptible (S) or infected (I), and the links represent the connection along which the infection can propagate. At each time step, susceptible (S) nodes may be infected from intra-layer infected nodes and inter-layer infected nodes simultaneously. On the other hand, infected nodes recover spontaneously. After some transient time, the previous dynamics make the system into a stationary state. For interacting two-layer networks, let b 1 (b 2 ) be the probability of infection between nodes in network A(B) and c 1 (c 2 ), the probability of infection from a node in B(A) to a node in A(B), l 1 (l 2 ) is the probability of curing for network A(B).

Fig. 4 shows that the epidemic thresholds b c 1 are consistent with epidemic thresholds b c 2 for 20 runs. We call the sub-network with the smallest epidemic threshold as the dominant network. Numerical analysis is used to verify the conclusion indicating that spreading process in the dominant network can promote the spreading process in a nondominant network with unidirectional interaction. We assume that network A is dominant and network B is nondominant, and A affects B although the inverse is not the case. The simulation result which is not shown here for brevity is similar to Fig. 3 . Thus, it reveals that the epidemic threshold of B in cooperative unidirectional interaction networks is well below the isolated network B. Therefore, we obtain the result with Eq. (26) .",

The white lines in the lower left corner are used to separate the epidemic survival region from epidemic die out region. q \u00bc 0 in this lower left smaller region means that the epidemic is eventually dying out. q > 0 in the upper right region means that the epidemic is going to be eventually persistent in the population. Thus, horizontal and vertical white lines represent the epidemic thresholds of complex network A and complex network B, respectively. Comparing the horizontal and vertical white lines in Figs. 5-7, we show that epidemic thresholds are decreased for cooperative multiplex networks using both first order approximation and second order approximation as compared to the epidemic thresholds of corresponding isolated networks. At the same time, Figs. 5 and 6 show that the die out regions differ trivially between first and second order approximation.

In particular, the epidemic thresholds of interacting two-layer networks can be decreased for cooperative spreading processes, thereby implying that cooperative spreading processes promote the spread of the disease. In theory, the global epidemic onset arises in the interacting networks simultaneously. Thus, a global epidemic threshold can be used to uniform the two epidemic thresholds. This model can also be used for unidirectional coupled networks. The results can provide hints for public health authorities to make effective measures for disease control and prevention.",
