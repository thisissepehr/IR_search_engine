The 5-year survival rate improves to~10% in patients who undergo surgical resection, and to~20% with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy. Based on the results of the ESPAC-3 and CONKO-001 trials, 1-3 gemcitabine was established as adjuvant therapy, with 5-year survival of 18-20%. In addition, it has been reported that there is no significant OS difference between patients treated with gemcitabine and 5-FU. 4 More recently, two clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit from combination chemotherapy. Firstly, the ESPAC-4 study showed that the combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine improved survival compared with gemcitabine alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.98), p = 0.032) with 5-year survival rates of 28.8% vs 16.3% (p = 0.32), 5 and this regimen is now included in the recently implemented ASCO clinical guidelines. 6 Secondly, the PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA.6 study 7 showed that adjuvant-modified (m)FOLFIRINOX was safe, and significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared with gemcitabine. Median DFS was 12.8 months in the gemcitabine arm vs 21.6 months in the mFOLFIRINOX arm (HR = 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47-0.74)), and median OS was 34.8 vs 54.4 months (HR = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.49-0.89)), respectively, such that mFOLFIRINOX is now also considered a standard of care for patients sufficiently fit to tolerate this combination.

Nevertheless, the majority of patients still experience disease recurrence, and further therapeutic advances are required. Thus, the incorporation of a safe, well-tolerated, non-cytotoxic agent such as TG01 may be particularly attractive in this context, and based on the encouraging safety, immunological and efficacy data presented here. Fig. 2 OS was assessed until the last patient had been in the study for 3 years.
